About the Author
A Chicago native for all but two years of her life, Kim Schilling resides in a
south suburb of Chicago with her husband, David, and son, Samuel. Kim pub-
lished the first Edition of Ferrets For Dummies in 2000 after three grueling
years of title changes, rewrites, and personnel turnovers. Today, her book is
the bestselling ferret book on the market. Although writing is a passion of
hers, and she vows to keep doing it, her true calling is her son, Sam. Her life
changed forever in 2001 when she broke her back and pelvis — the result of a
horseback-riding accident on Mother’s Day. The traumatic injuries were the
bad news; the good news was that she found out the baby she was told she’d
never have was three weeks in the making. Born in 2002, this little miracle
changed her life. At one time, Kim thought she knew what was important.
Today, she knows without a doubt what’s important. Sam, this wonderful, lit
boy, has completed her life.
When Kim isn’t working full time or being Mom, she’s running Animals for
Awareness, a USDA-licensed and -inspected facility. Created in the early 
1990s — incorporated in 1997, with nonprofit status attained in 1999 —
Animals for Awareness is dedicated to meeting the needs of wild and exotic
animals. Its mission: Protection Through Education. Although Animals for
Awareness doesn’t adopt out exotic animals to the general public, it does find
permanent USDA facilities for the bigger exotic animals and almost always
has domestic critters such as ferrets up for adoption. Kim and many of her
exotic critters frequently hit the road to educate as many people as possible.
Her main goal is to promote responsible pet ownership and discourage the
keeping of exotic, dangerous, or wild animals. Among the 50 species of animals
she cares for, Kim dotes on her six ferrets — Squee, Gir, Gaz, Casanova, 
Dusk, and Macey — who reside peacefully with three happy little fennec
foxes. You can learn more about Animals for Awareness at www.animals
forawareness.org.

Dedication
For my beautiful son, Sam, for he is the brightest blessing in my life. For David,
my husband, who stands by my side. For my dearest friend Dr. Mike Miller,
whose untimely passing will always leave a gaping hole in my heart and
whose wisdom filled my life with priceless knowledge. For my invaluable, 
precious friend Bob Church, whose immeasurable love and understanding of
ferrets has so inspired and taught me. 

Author’s Acknowledgments
I have to start off by extending a big thank you to Dr. Susan Brown, my techni-
cal and medical editor, who went way above and beyond the call of duty by
spending countless hours helping me research and answer my many ques-
tions. Susan was both my coach and my cheerleader. She is truly priceless
and inspiring, and I value the friend I gained in her. A big hug and a thank you
to Bob Church for his generous help on many areas of the book, in particular
the diet and enrichment chapters. What’s a ferret book without the influences
of Bob Church? 
Thank you to a doll of a guy, Travis Livieri, for his devotion and work with
black-footed ferrets and for lending his support to me. Thank you to the fol-
lowing fantastic veterinarians for reviewing and contributing to medical sec-
tions or issues: Dr. Bruce Williams (ECE and the infamous Poop Chart), 
Dr. Jerry Murray (heart disease, heartworms, and diet), Dr. Karen Purcell
(descenting and diet), and Dr. Katrina Ramsell (DIM). Some of these wonder-
ful vets took their precious time to review other parts of the book as well.
Vickie McKimmey of Just a Business of Ferrets and Scarlett Gray of Scarlett’s
Happy Dookers, both judges with the American Ferret Association, spent a
lot of time going through pictures to pick out the best color photos for the
color insert. I thank them from the bottom of my heart! Speaking of photos,
thank you to Jennifer Deming for your talent as a photographer. I was blessed
to find you. You are nothing but a pleasure to work with — a true gem! 
Many other individuals helped with this book, including Sukie Crandall with
her wealth of knowledge, Bill Gruber, Renee Downs, Dr. John Lewington, Julie
Fossa, and Marie Bartholdsson. Dr. June McNicholas was priceless when it
came to sharing her thoughts on hybrids. And I’d still know nothing about
angoras had it not been for Lisa Oestereich and Christine Matthis. A heartfelt
thank you to each of you. Special thanks to Dr. Valerie Staton for sharing her
expertise on ferret introductions and aggression. Her grasp of ferret behavior
is amazing! Thank you to all of you who sent in photos for possible publica-
tion. The publisher decided to go only with Jennifer’s pictures. My apologies.
Finally, a special thank you to Rebecca Stout, aka Wolfy, who jumped through
hoops to get me information on deaf ferrets and to update her Web site in
anticipation of it being published in Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition. She’s a
champ! Editors Mike Lewis, Josh Dials, and Natalie Harris of Wiley have to be
acknowledged for putting up with my mood swings and difficult moments.
There were many others who helped make the second edition possible, and
to all of them I extend a heartfelt thank you!

Foreword
W
hen I graduated from veterinary school and started my career in 1976
I didn’t know anyone who kept a ferret for a pet much less had I ever
seen one other than in pictures. My only experience with them was in an
undergraduate ethology class where I watched a 30-minute video of the
behavior of the European polecat, and I wrote a paper on the subject. I had
seen and taken care of just about every other kind of “nontraditional” pet in
my life, but a real live ferret was yet to be seen. 
I saw my first pet ferret patient in 1978, at the small animal practice where I
was employed in the Chicago suburbs. By 1980, I started a strictly exotic
animal veterinary practice, and gradually these funny, wiggly little critters
called ferrets entered my life in gradually increasing numbers, and the fasci-
nation began. There were few veterinarians I knew of at the time whos knew
much about ferrets; even my colleagues in the United Kingdom, where ferrets
had been used for centuries, knew very little about the diseases I was seeing
here in the United States. James Fox’s first edition of his book Biology and
Diseases of the Ferret would not be published until 1988, so we had little 
science-based reference material on which to rely. 
In 1982, I was asked to give a talk to the Chicago Veterinary Medical
Association to a small group of veterinarians who were interested in exotic
pets. I spent one afternoon at the Purdue University Veterinary School
Library gleaning all I could about these little beasties. I read and copied
every article, every chapter in a book, and every other publication I could
find on ferrets, and I did it all in one afternoon! Remember there was no
Internet to turn to back then; one had to go to the library and search through
books and archived articles. I prepared for the talk, gathered a few photos,
and made as extensive an outline as I could for a handout, a grand total of six
pages long. Thinking I would be speaking to maybe 5 people, I walked into the
room and there were 30 people waiting to hear all about ferrets! Everyone
was hungry for knowledge, and they thought I had it! 
After getting over my stage fright, I proceeded to give my talk, and by the end
of that evening I was transformed into the local veterinary “ferret expert.”
Ferrets started coming into my practice in larger and larger numbers as they
were referred by other veterinarians in the area. I got phone calls asking for
consultations from veterinarians from all over the country. Over the next
decade the percentage of ferrets in our practice grew from about 2 percent to
20 percent! Ferrets were fascinating, and their popularity as a pet was increas-
ing rapidly. Caregivers and veterinarians wanted to know how to manage them. 
I was so taken with these little guys that I got the first FERRET license plates
for my car in Illinois in 1980, and in 1987, I cofounded the Greater Chicago

Ferret Association (GCFA) with Janice Miller to help ferret owners come
together and share and learn more about ferrets. The GCFA had the first free-
standing all-ferret shelter in the country, which has by now had several thou-
sand ferrets pass through its portals. For the next two decades I spoke to
numerous veterinary organizations and wrote in a number of veterinary texts
about ferret husbandry and disease. I have personally cared for many fabu-
lous ferrets of my own, starting with Guido, who was a stray a client found
and gave me in 1982. He was a great teacher and a wonderful friend, and I will
be forever grateful to him for helping me to understand the mystique, the
wonder, and the comedy of this marvelous little creature.
So now, more than 30 years after I started my veterinary career, if I went to a vet-
erinary school library to read everything I could about ferrets, it would easily
take a week, not the mere afternoon it took me back in 1982. Just reading the
information available on the Internet about ferrets would takes days in itself!
Ferret caregivers and veterinarians from all over the world have contributed to
a huge body of knowledge that continues to grow about this fascinating little
critter. Much of it is good, but there still remains a lot of misinformation as well. 
Considering how much information, both good and bad, is out there to wade
through, Kim Schilling has done a phenomenal job sifting through it and
putting it all together in this comprehensive book, Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd
Edition. This is the second edition of the book, and it has been expanded
greatly from the first with additional topics and lots of updates to the infor-
mation in the first book. I have had the honor and pleasure of being Kim’s
Technical Editor on this book, and she has made my job very easy because
she has taken hundreds of hours of her time in researching each topic thor-
oughly and then interpreting and condensing the information into a very
readable format. Her attention to detail is phenomenal, and she has left no
stone unturned when it comes to delving into ferret topics! Kim has a fabu-
lous sense of humor, and it shows in her writing, making it a real pleasure to
read this book. There is hardly a topic she has not touched on, even some of
the more difficult or controversial ones, making this book a real gem for
anyone wanting to learn how to care for our ferret friends. 
It’s fantastic to be able to have one book that so thoroughly covers all the ferret
topics one could possibly imagine. Looking back 30 years to the time when we
had little information about these important pets, I am so pleased to know we
have such a gold mine as Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition, available today.
I would recommend Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition, without hesitation to
anyone wanting to learn everything there is to know about caring for a ferret.
This book is a must-have for the shelves of veterinarians, ferret rescue orga-
nizations, and any ferret caregiver. Even if you don’t have a ferret but are
interested in learning about them, this book is a fun and informative read.
Enjoy.

Introduction
N
umerous people have told me that a true love for animals may be genet-
ically predisposed. Maybe this is true. Or maybe some animals just tug
at our heartstrings a little harder than others. I believe both statements to
apply to me. Although my love for animals may be termed “genetics” by the
white-coated scientists in those sterile laboratories, I prefer to call what was
passed on to me a blessing. I knew the moment my eyes locked onto a bounc-
ing, chattering ferret that I’d been hooked by something mysteriously fasci-
nating. Each one of my ferrets has provided me with much happiness and joy
over the years. Even though all my ferrets, young and old, share in common
the ability to make me break out in laughter with their habitual silliness, each
one is a unique little fuzzball. And they continuously amaze me with their
intelligence and social play.
Ferrets are fun and mischievous. They’re cunning looters. They can steal and
break your heart. They come in all sorts of colors and sizes. Ferrets can get
into the littlest cracks and holes, both in your home and in your soul. They’re
bound to make you break out in uncontrollable laughter at least once a day.
They steal any chance they can to dance and dook and chatter about. And
when they’re through amazing you with their antics, most ferrets love noth-
ing more than to curl up somewhere warm with you and snooze the rest of
the day away.
Sound like the perfect pet? Not necessarily. As a shelter director, my motto is
“Not all animals make good pets for people, and not all people make good
parents for pets.” No two households, people, or lifestyles are the same.
Although ferrets can bring you plenty of joy, they also can be quite challeng-
ing at times.
That’s why I wrote this book about these amazing creatures. If you don’t yet
have a ferret, this book can help you decide whether a fuzzy is for you. And if
you already have a ferret, this book can help you give him the best possible
care. To boot, this book offers practical health and medical information. And
everything from cover to cover is in cut-to-the-chase format — only what you
need to know, in good ol’ plain English.

Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
About This Book
You have plenty to discover — and a lot of responsibility to take on — when
you decide to adopt a ferret. Pet ownership isn’t something to take lightly.
You should always make a lifetime commitment when deciding to bring any
pet into your home. This book helps you gain better insight into what’s
required so that you can make the right choices for your lifestyle.
This book doesn’t require a read from cover to cover (of course, you can read
it that way if you want to). Instead, this book is a reference guide. If you have
a particular topic you want to research, you can turn right to the chapter that
covers the topic.
Each chapter is divided into sections, and each section contains pieces of
info about some part of ferret keeping — things like this:
 Is a ferret the right pet for you?
 How do I pick a healthy ferret?
 What steps do I take to ferret-proof my home?
 How do I set up my ferret’s cage?
 What medical conditions require a vet’s care?
Conventions Used in This Book
Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition, makes information easy to find and use. To
guide you through the information and instructions in this book, I’ve used
certain conventions:
 Italics note emphasis and highlight new words or terms that I define.
 Boldfaced text indicates the action part of numbered steps or identifies
keywords in bulleted lists.
 Monofont sets apart Web sites and e-mail addresses.
What You’re Not to Read
You don’t actually have to read anything in this book. I’m confident you won’t
be able to resist turning the pages, but I won’t test you on anything. I just

want you to know that if you’re in a hurry, you can skip over text marked by
the Technical Stuff icon (see the section “Icons Used in This Book” if you
want to know more about that). You also can skip over the gray text boxes
(known as “sidebars”), because they don’t contain critical ferret-owning
information.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition, I made some assumptions about
my readers:
 You’re one of the thousands and thousands of people out there who has a
nagging child or spouse who whines daily about wanting to own a ferret.
Or maybe you’ve had your emotions kidnapped by a ferret, and you want
to make sure that a ferret is the pet for you before you adopt him.
 Perhaps you’re one of those lucky folks who already owns a ferret, and
you want to know how to properly care for him.
 You may be a volunteer or employee at a ferret shelter, humane society,
veterinarian clinic, or pet shop. You’ve been given (or have volunteered
for) the task of ferret-keeper, and you want to know about caring for
these fantastic furballs.
 You may be a “seasoned” ferret owner who’s soon to discover that this
book covers topics that you can’t find in other ferret books, such as
behavior challenges, alternative diet, and saying goodbye.
 You may be one of the many who realize the growing need for — and
importance of — enrichment in the lives of our ferrets and value the
extensive information provided by this book on enrichment.
 You may be a veterinarian who wants to know as much about the ferrets
you treat — including basic history — as you do about the people who
bring them in.
Whatever made you pick up this book, hold onto your hat, because you’re in
for the thrill of a lifetime!
How This Book Is Organized
To help you find the information you’re looking for, I divide this book into
seven parts. Each part includes several chapters relating to a specific topic
on ferrets. Find the part that suits you and jump right in!
3
Introduction

Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You?
Part I is probably the most important part for people who are in the “consid-
ering” stage. Ferrets aren’t cats — and they certainly aren’t dogs. And heaven
knows they’re not for everyone! This part tells you what you can expect from
a ferret and what a ferret will expect (and need) from you. And for people
who are absolutely set on becoming a ferret human, you need to check out
this part to brush up on the legalities of owning a ferret where you live.
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging
Up the Welcome Hammock
So many ferrets, so little time! This part gives you detailed steps on what to
look for in a new ferret and how to find the right one for you. Young or old?
Single, pair, or trio? Shelter, breeder, or pet shop? And after you decide on the
right ferret, you have other important stuff to do before he comes home, like
setting up his cage properly and getting all the necessary ferret supplies.
Finally, this part gives you solid tips on interacting with your new ferret and
safely introducing him to other family members.
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding
No time to rest, because you have some more decisions to make. What kinds
of foods and treats are good for your ferret? How do you keep him from get-
ting bored? This part gives you suggestions for how to be creative and stay
safe in the ferret kitchen and on the ferret playground. But having a ferret
isn’t all fun and games, so you also find out how and when to clean up your
ferret and his cage. Finally, this part has great tips and guidance that can help
you make decisions about whether to travel (and how to travel) with your
ferret.
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health
Issues and Treatments
From stocking the must-have first-aid kit, to knowing how to give first aid, to
explaining more serious ferret health issues, this part covers all aspects of
ferret healthcare — right down to knowing when to say goodbye to your
dearly loved ferret. In addition, this part helps you find the best vet for your
ferret and gives you a basic overview of common illnesses and diseases so
you’ll know when you need to head off to the vet’s office.

Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: 
Behavior and Training
So, you think your ferret is crazy? You want to know what your ferret is
saying? And what does he mean when he moves in all directions at one time?
This part clues you in to ferret communication and behavior. Knowing a little
more about your ferret will help you with basic training such as nip training,
litter-box training, and leash and harness training. Getting instructions on
dealing with the behaviorally challenged ferret is just as important, so this
part dives into that topic as well.
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts,
Fallacies, and Plain ol’ Hard Work
This part offers a brief introduction to ferret reproduction and growth, from
the breeding pair to the birth to preparing kits for their new homes. It touches
on medical issues related to breeding and explains what’s required to be a
responsible breeder. But most importantly, this part gets you to think about
the whole breeding picture. Why breed? What are the problems associated
with breeding? Do you have what it takes to breed, or are you just creating
more need for ferret shelters?
Part VII: The Part of Tens
I’ve saved some of the best information for last! Thinking of trying an alternative
diet? Here you can read about some great recipes to try at home. Want to know
about some common myths and misconceptions so you can know the real facts
and educate others? I have you covered.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book full of great information, I include icons that
point out helpful hints, fun facts, and things you’d be wise to keep in mind. In
a nutshell, the icons do the following:
This icon provides tidbits of info that can make your life as a ferret mom or
dad a little easier. Many of these tips were discovered by people, including
myself, who learned some ferret-owning facts the hard way.
5
Introduction

This icon points out interesting and sometimes technical ferret facts — some
of which I stumbled upon while researching for this book. Not all this stuff
makes for good dinner conversation, but you’re never too old to learn.
Consider this information interesting but nonessential.
Don’t glaze over the information accompanying this icon. Paying attention to
what’s here can save your ferret’s life or prevent injury and illness — perhaps
even major vet bills.
The paragraph(s) accompanying this icon points out important stuff that you
should store in an easily accessed part of your brain.
This icon highlights terms that may be new to you and that you may
encounter or need to know in the future as a ferret owner.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re thinking about getting a ferret, or you want to know how to get a
healthy one, start at the beginning with Parts I and II. If you already have a
ferret, you can delve into whatever chapter you want, hopping around as
issues or problems arise, or as time permits.
Bottom line? Enjoy this book as it was meant to be enjoyed. Remember:
People learn new things every day about ferrets. And the best teachers are
our ferrets themselves. Don’t be afraid to ask questions from the experts, such
as your vet. Doing so is well worth the time, and it makes ferret parenting a
much more pleasant experience. Besides, asking is the only way you can learn.

Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part I
Is a Ferret Right 
for You?

In this part . . .
E
very animal has a beast within that takes a little get-
ting used to. This goes for humans, too. Because
you’re reading this book, I can safely assume that you’re
thinking of adding a ferret to your family. The world, it
seems, has been bombarded with dogs and cats, and
maybe you’ve decided you want a more exciting pet to
spice up your life.
What’s wrong with a ferret? Maybe nothing at all. A ferret
may be the perfect pet for you. Or perhaps you should
reconsider your decision to get a fuzzy. The answer to the
question “Can’t we all just get along?” is never cut and
dry. It’s important to know what you’ll be dealing with
before you bring home any pet. And this part helps you
sort out exactly what you’re dealing with so you know
what a ferret is all about and whether adopting one is
right for you. I also discuss whether you’re even allowed
to own a fuzzy, which depends on the laws in your city
and state.

Chapter 1
What You Need to Know 
About Ferrets
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the description of a ferret
 Listing the basic ferret info, from color to odor
 Understanding the fuzzy’s exercise needs
 Addressing the financial and legal matters that ferrets bring
 Incorporating the ferret into your home
 Introducing your fuzzy to other kids and pets
T
o the undiscerning eye, she looks a little rat-like. But she acts and moves
more like a cat. Sometimes, she fools you and becomes quite dog-like. She
resembles some animals you see roaming your backyard or other curious
critters featured on a nature television show. And at some point, you’ll wit-
ness some people in a pet store pointing at a cage full of them, inquiring,
“Good heavens, what in the world are those? Opossums?” I think not!
The lovable animal I refer to is the ferret, of course. She belongs to a colorful
clan of creatures and often gets mistaken for different animals. In this chap-
ter, I tell you all about the ferret’s vast family, his close and distant relatives,
and his interesting history. (And for you technical readers, I throw in all sorts
of Latin lingo that may confuse even the professionals out there.)
And before you actually run out and get your new family member, you must
consider all the things your ferret will require of you — space, safety, and so
on — so I cover these things here as well. After all, how can you promise to
be a good mom or dad to your fuzzy if you don’t even know what goes into
good ferret parenting? Taking an honest look at the requirements can mean
the difference between living happily with a new family member and taking
on a major, unwelcome chore.

10
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 
First Question: What Is a Ferret?
Although ferrets may look rodent-like with their long, pointed snouts and
ticklish whiskers (see Figure 1-1), they’re not rodents at all. Ferrets come
from the order Carnivora, which simply means “meat or flesh eating.” This
order encompasses a huge group of animals, from Fifi the common lap dog
to the mighty African lion. Within the order Carnivora, ferrets belong to the
family Mustelidae, which they proudly share with such bold critters as the
badger, wolverine, pine marten, and sea otter. Included in that family are both
domesticated ferrets and ferret-like wild animals such as the weasel,
European polecat, steppe polecat, black-footed ferret, and mink.
The word ferret is appropriately derived from the Latin word Furonem, which
means “thief.” As a new ferret owner, you’ll quickly realize just how thieving
your new family member can be. As cute as this endearing trait may be at
times, it has its downsides. It once took me over a day to find all the contents
of my purse, which I foolishly left open in the presence of roving ferrets.
Many ferret owners call their pets a variety of nicknames. Some of the names
that I use throughout this book are fuzzy, carpet shark, snorkeler, furball, and
fuzzbutt. I know that many more terms of endearment exist out there. Don’t
get confused!
Speaking ferret Latin
The ferret’s scientific name as of press time,
preferred mostly by North-American scientists,
is Mustela putorius furo. This name exists
because of the beliefs concerning the function
and nature of the ferret. For those of you who
don’t speak ferret Latin, Mustela means
“weasel” or “mouse killer.” Putorius is derived
from the Latin word putoris, meaning “stench,”
and furo is derived from the Latin word furis,
meaning “thief.” The word ferret itself is derived
from the Latin word furonem, which also means
“thief.” Put all this together and you have one
little “stinky mouse-killing thief.” Although the
historical ferret may have lived up to this dubi-
ous title, today’s ferret is more often than not a
cuddly little furball. For all practical purposes, I
fondly refer to my ferrets as Ferretus majorus
pleasorus in the comfort of my nonscientific
home!
Some scientists who agree with me are now
challenging the beliefs about ferrets — partic-
ularly some of the DNA evidence, as used in
some paternity tests. The white coats doing
most of the ancestral and DNA research are
Europeans who prefer to call the ferret Mustela
furo. Currently, several papers exist that support
Mustela furo. The scientific name of our domes-
tic ferret may very well change in the near
future.

Giving the Ferret a Physical: Examining
Fuzzy Characteristics
Before you bring a new fuzzy home or in the early stages of your ferret par-
enthood, you need to become familiar a ferret’s physical inventory. When I
say physical, I pretty much mean all the general stuff regarding a ferret’s
physical characteristics, from his paws and claws to his weight and remark-
able (and not-so-remarkable) senses.
Take a look at Figure 1-2 if you really want to get down to the bones, literally,
of examining a ferret’s physical makeup! For information on ferret coats and
colors, see Chapter 2.
In the following sections, I introduce you to the physical characteristics of
the ferret. My version of a ferret physical also covers other tidbits you should
know, like color combos and life span, because knowing how to accessorize
your fuzzy and how long you’ll be caring for him is important.
Looking at the life span of a fuzzy
The average life span of a well-cared-for ferret is between 6 to 8 years, but
I’ve heard many stories of ferrets that have lived for up to 9 or 10 years, bar-
ring any unforeseen mishaps. My belief is that a ferret’s environment — his
caging, disease, stress, diet, and so on — plays a role in his short lifespan. As
ferret owners discover more and are taught more about the ferret, they’ll
undoubtedly be able to increase the expected lifespan significantly.

Chapter 1: What You Need to Know About Ferrets

For now, though, you can only do your best to make your ferret’s quality of
life top-notch. At 1 year old, your fuzzy is considered full grown. At 3 to 4,
he’s considered middle-aged, and at 5 to 6 years of age, he’s considered a
geriatric, or an old fert! At this time, she may begin to slowly lose weight and
start encountering debilitating illnesses. This is when things get tough and
you’re faced with difficult choices (see Chapter 17 for advice on saying good-
bye to your fuzzy).
As heartbreaking as it is, ferrets are prone to many diseases and may be
genetically or medically flawed. Like most companion pets, whose life spans
are short compared to humans, ferrets’ lives are compacted into only 6 to 8
oh-so-short years. The average human has 65 to 70 years to experience what
a ferret experiences in under a decade. The ferret is an amazing trooper with
a tremendous fight for life, and you can certainly do your part to help. See
Chapters 15 and 16 for more on the conditions that can afflict your fuzzy and
for tips on how to care for him.
In this corner, weighing in at . . .
A carpet shark’s size makes him an ideal pet for both the apartment dweller
and the homeowner. As is the case with some mammal species, unneutered
male ferrets typically measure up to two times larger than females — called
sexual dimorphism. There is a notable weight difference in the head and
torso, where the male is wider and less dainty.
A typical altered female ferret weighs between a slim 3⁄4ths of a pound (0.3 kg)
and a whopping 21⁄2 pounds (1.1 kg) — and that’s a big girl. Neutered males
normally weigh 2 to 31⁄2 pounds (0.9 to 1.6 kg), and unaltered males may weigh
in at 4 to 6 pounds (1.8 to 2.7 kg) or more. In tape-measure terms, without the
tail, female ferrets are between 13 and 14 inches (33 and 35.5 cm) long, and
males generally measure between 15 and 16 inches (38 and 40.6 cm). A
ferret’s tail is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long. See Figure 1-3.

Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

Ferrets are kind of like humans in that they tend to bulk up in the winter.
Sometimes ferrets gain 40 percent of their weight at this time of the year and
then lose it in the spring (as do humans, right?). This isn’t always the rule,
though; some ferrets always seem skinny, and others are belly draggers all
year round. Could it have something to do with health and/or exercise?
Better check it out. (Parts III and IV of this book cover various issues related
to exercise and health.)
Getting to the point about claws and teeth
On each of a ferret’s soft paws is a set of five nonretractable claws designed
for digging and grasping. Nature designed the claws to stay there for a ferret’s
benefit and survival, so you should never remove them. Frequent clipping,
about every 7–10 days, is recommended (see Chapter 9 for more on grooming
tips and Chapter 6 for more on ferret-proofing your home).
Declawing your ferret is a big, fat no-no. For a fuzzball, declawing is a painful,
mutilating surgery with way more risks than benefits. Ferrets need their claws
for digging, grasping, walking, and playing. The base of the claw gives the
ferret’s foot added strength to support his weight. Removing the claws causes
foot problems and/or pain when walking. If you think you’ll be too lazy to clip
your ferret’s nails, you must recognize that a ferret isn’t the pet for you.

Chapter 1: What You Need to Know About Ferrets

Like all carnivores (see the first section in this chapter), ferrets have large
canine teeth that can be rather intimidating. A ferret’s teeth usually hang lower
than his lip flap and are in full view. Although any animal with a mouth can and
will bite under certain circumstances, I’ve found the biting ferret to be the
exception rather than the rule. Most ferrets use their canine teeth to show off
to their friends and to eat. When a ferret nips, she does it out of fear or play. An
occasional warning nip may be a sign of the ferret’s disapproval of one thing or
another. (See Chapter 3 for more about the laws governing ferret bites.)
Make no doubt about it, the bite of a disgruntled ferret is painful and can
draw blood. Take measures to make sure bites don’t happen, and unless med-
ically warranted for your ferret’s health, don’t alter his canine teeth; leave
them right where they belong.
Making sense of senses
A ferret’s senses vary in degree of acuteness (see Chapter 10 for more 
on ferret senses). Like human infants, a ferret’s eyesight isn’t that well-
developed, and his ability to distinguish color is limited. A ferret can only 
see some reds and blues. Make no mistake about it, though: Even the most
restricted ferret can and will find any object he wasn’t intended to find (and
his stubby little legs will help him steal the objects back to his hidey-hole). In
a sense, all ferrets have sticky fingers: If they find it, it belongs to them. If
they want it, it’s theirs. You get the idea.
A ferret’s sense of smell is far superior to a human’s, and his little paw pads
are more sensitive to the touch. Also, a fuzzy’s sense of hearing is remark-
able. If you open a bag of raisins from across your house, for example, be
assured that your ferret will hear the bag opening and come a-begging. So,
remember to whisper when discussing sensitive issues such as altering or
going on vacation.
Have I mentioned that ferrets have another sense? They seem to understand
us humans. Scary!
Exercise and Time Considerations —
Yours and Your Fuzzy’s
When determining whether a ferret is the perfect pet for you, get introspec-
tive and look at your lifestyle. Ferrets are interactive and intelligent pets that
need a lot of attention. If you want a pet that you can keep in a cage and look
at every once in a while, you must accept that a ferret isn’t for you. Fish are
good when left in their cages. Ferrets are exploratory characters that aim to
14
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

please their humans. Okay, they really aim to please themselves, but they
tickle us pink in the process.
Ferrets need a lot of exercise and attention to be happy and healthy. Plan on
spending no less than four hours a day playing in a safe, stimulating, enriched,
ferret-proof environment. If you leave a fuzzy in a cage or unattended too
often, it actually leads to boredom and stress, which can in turn lead to seri-
ous health issues. Trust me, it will do you a world of good to get down on the
floor with your ferret and let out your inner fuzzy. (For more information
about enriching your ferret’s life, check out Chapter 10.)
If you don’t think you can provide your ferret with the proper amount of exer-
cise and attention, and that’s your only ferret hang-up, perhaps you should
consider adopting two ferrets. Ferrets live to play and they play to live, so if
you can’t be an interactive human all the time, get your fuzzy a playmate.
Besides, although one furball is intensely amusing, two (or more) are down-
right hysterical. In fact, I recommend getting two or three no matter what
(see Chapter 4 for more on this advice).
If you let him, a healthy caged ferret will sleep 18 to 20 hours a day. Does this
make these ferrets nocturnal or diurnal? Neither. I think they should get a cat-
egory all to themselves. How about ferturnal? Most weasels are considered
nocturnal, although they may change their sleeping patterns depending on
habitat, competition, and food availability. Like their polecat relatives,
healthy, free-roaming ferrets with little cage time should sleep only 15 to 18
hours a day. Strive to make your ferrets as active as possible.
Ferrets tend to be crepuscular, which means they usually pep up and come
out at dusk and dawn, similar to deer. However, ferrets change their activity
levels to meet their humans’ schedules. For example, if you’re a night owl and
sleep all day, your ferrets will be night owls too. Just as weasels will adapt to
best suit their survival needs, ferrets can be diurnal, nocturnal, or crepuscu-
lar. What sleeping patterns your ferret adopts is up to you! (For tips on your
ferret’s cage and bedding for sleep time, see Chapter 5.)
Taking a Whiff of the Odor Factor
All ferrets come equipped with a really “neat” scenting mechanism. Located
just outside the ferret’s anus on both sides are anal sacs filled with foul-
smelling fluid. All carnivores have these sacs, including the beloved canine. A
ferret’s system is quite different from the human scenting mechanism, though,
which is more often than not triggered by disagreeable food or the simple
desire to offend. When excited, overstimulated, scared, or angry, your ferret
will, without aim, discharge his secret weapon. But the ferret’s odor, although
intentionally disturbing, rapidly dispels — just like yours! The following sec-
tions deal with a couple issues you face when playing the odor factor.
15
Chapter 1: What You Need to Know About Ferrets

To descent or not to descent?
The majority of ferrets I’ve run across have been descented at a very early
age — before they reach the pet trade. In other words, vets have removed
their anal glands. Most ferrets are commercially raised in fuzzy farms where
neutering and descenting occur before the fuzzies can be shipped out. As a
new owner, you have no real way to tell whether a ferret has been descented,
however. The moment of truth comes at the moment of nasal impact.
Personally I don’t recommend descenting ferrets. I find it an unnecessary and
potentially harmful procedure. However, some ferret owners can’t or don’t
want to tolerate the rare “poof” of odor expelled from the undescented ferret.
Finding a vet who’s performed this procedure before may be a challenge, but
most experienced ferret vets may be willing to take on the challenge and
should do just fine. Don’t be surprised if you find that this surgery doesn’t
cut down on the odor as much as you thought it would. The anal glands are
not the problem! Ferrets are musky critters with oil glands in their skin. And
unneutered ferrets are extremely smelly.
If you should happen upon a ferret with full scent capabilities in your search
for a pet, take note, though: Descenting isn’t necessary for living happily with
a ferret. In fact, descenting is a North-American practice and is illegal in many
European countries that consider it unethical. The ferret’s scent glands may
be an important behavioral and social tool. Perhaps they use scent as a means
of identifying one ferret from another or determining the health status of
another ferret. Scent may also indicate where a ferret is in its breeding cycle.
Unless medically necessitated, I suggest that you leave your ferret be and pay
more heed to his emotional state so you can control the odor. Some people
actually like the smell. I find myself neutral to it. Those of you who have
roommates will surely agree that ferret odor is more often the lesser of the
two evils.
Controlling your fuzzy’s odor
The ferret’s odor is unique and requires regular maintenance for odor con-
trol. You need to change his oil and rotate his tires every 3,000 miles, so to
speak. Frequently changing his litter and bedding is the best way to control
odor (see Chapter 9).
Bathing your ferret often results in a stinkier fuzzy because his oil glands go
into overdrive to replace the oils you washed down the drain. I only bathe my
ferrets a few times a year, and that seems plenty.
16
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

There’s always some odor involved with ferrets. Even the most well-cared-for
ferret will have a slight musky smell. On average, the odor is no worse than a
dog’s smell; however, people’s tolerances for smell are different. Obviously, if
you let your ferret go for very long periods without a bath or if you become
too lax with changing his litter box and bedding, his smell will become
stronger.
Getting the Dish on Financial Matters
Ferrets are expensive pets. Whether you purchase your baby at a pet store,
adopt her from a shelter, or have a neighbor leave her on your doorstep (see
Chapter 4), you need to fork over not only emotion but also money. Investing
in a ferret family member has many intangible rewards, but you must be will-
ing to put out the cash when necessary to keep her safe and sound. The fol-
lowing list outlines the expenses you’ll incur after adopting your fuzzy:
 Basic accessories: This category includes such things as cages, toys,
bedding, bowls, litter boxes, treats, and so on.
 Food: Ferrets need high-quality ferret food, which is more costly than
low-quality food. And the more ferrets you have, the more they’ll eat.
Are you willing to pay more for a high-quality food to keep your ferrets
as healthy as possible? (See Chapter 8 for more on feeding your ferret.)
 Neutering or spaying: Your new baby may or may not be altered, but
unless you plan on breeding, which I caution you to think twice about,
get him altered as soon as possible. Besides being the responsible thing
to do, it’ll cut down on the odor.
 Annual vet trips: Besides regular checkups (see Chapter 12), your ferret
should receive annual rabies and distemper vaccinations, as well as
heartworm preventives (vaccinations may be required by law; see
Chapter 3).
17
Chapter 1: What You Need to Know About Ferrets
An expert’s opinion on descenting
“Ferret farms descent ferrets in the mistaken
belief that it decreases the odor of these musky
pets. In fact, it is completely unnecessary for
odor control. Unfortunately for the ferrets,
descenting can lead to lifetime complications
including draining tracts, chronic abscesses,
pain, and/or incontinence. As a veterinarian and
ferret owner, I cannot recommend this as a rou-
tine procedure for any reason,” says ferret
expert Dr. Karen Purcell, author of Essentials of
Ferrets: A Guide for Practitioners (AAHA Press)
and relief veterinarian in New England.

As your ferret ages, the chances of him developing an illness or disease
increases. Often, this means more frequent trips to the vet for special tests
and/or medication. You owe it to any pet you have to provide quality medical
care at all times.
The dollars can add up. Think about starting a pet fund, in which you put
aside a few dollars each week in case an emergency comes up and you fall a
little short financially. Also, pet insurance is becoming more and more popu-
lar among ferret owners. Do your research (starting with your veterinarian)
to see whether insurance is an avenue to pursue. Either way, do yourself a
favor and put aside some funds if you can.
Extreme Cage Makeover: Providing 
the Space They Need
You shouldn’t bring a ferret to your home before you’ve completely and ade-
quately set up his house for his arrival. Even though ferrets make great pets
for both the house and apartment, you shouldn’t compromise one luxury: His
cage should be roomy, and you should make adequate room for it. (See
Chapter 5 for more on creating a ferret cage.)
If your only available space is a wall that’s supporting the world’s largest
beer-bottle collection, you should consider parting with the bottles or pack-
ing them up. Even if you could squeeze in both the ferret and the beer bot-
tles, doing so wouldn’t be a good idea. Your carpet shark could knock them
over and break them, or your thief could manage to drag a bottle or two back
to his secret hidey-hole!
Facing the Challenges of Ferret-Proofing
Your Home
Ferrets are trouble magnets. From digging up the plants and carpeting, to
stealing your stuff, to terrorizing the cats and dogs — if something can be
messed with, a ferret will mess with it.
I compare this vigorous playtime madness to a human toddler on a double
espresso. To combat the madness and protect your ferret, you need to ferret-
proof your home — or at least the areas the little bugger has access to. It may
be as simple as moving the houseplants, or it may be as involved as boarding
up the cracks and crevices under your cabinets. Nature designed the ferret to
search out your ferret-proofing failures. Therefore, ferret-proofing is a contin-
uous activity as your curious fuzzy finds more and more flaws.
18
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

If you even question whether something is unsafe, it’s probably unsafe.
Otherwise, you wouldn’t give it a second thought. Expect the impossible, pre-
pare for the worst, and hope for the best. What actually happens will proba-
bly be somewhere in between. For tips on how to make your home safe for
your ferret, head to Chapter 6
Ferrets and Kids
Ferrets can make good pets for single people living in apartments and for
families in homes. I don’t like to stereotype human children as a whole by
saying this pet or that pet isn’t good with kids. Usually, it’s the other way
around. Many kids aren’t good around certain types of pets, although many
are great. I was taking care of pets before I was even 10 years old, and I did so
with great pleasure and responsibility. I didn’t mind getting scratched or
bitten, and I didn’t mind the cage cleaning. I was an exception to most kids.
Ferrets can be playfully nippy and squirmy, and they require a lot of attention
and care. Most young children can and will activate the hyper switch in fer-
rets. And don’t be fooled if your kid promises to be 100-percent responsible
for his new ferret. You must evaluate your family members honestly before
bringing a ferret home and expect that you’ll be the main caretaker. See
Chapter 7 for more on this topic.
Ferrets and Other Household Pets
All animals have unique personalities, so to assume that one pet will get
along with another is to be overly optimistic — an attitude that could lead to
heartbreak. Multi-species interaction is a complex issue. I simply can’t guar-
antee that your new fuzzy will get along with your other pets.
Certain breeds of dogs are bred to hunt small animals, which the ferret is.
And ferrets are bred as predators and may find birds, hamsters, and even
small kittens as the perfect prey. Cats and ferrets often get along well, but you
can’t force a relationship that isn’t there.
Having said all that, I don’t see a reason why a ferret couldn’t peacefully
cohabitate in most homes if the owners use common sense. The key is to
know your animals and their limits. Provide meticulous supervision at all
times. When you introduce your pets, you may have to conclude that mixing
the species just won’t work in your home; be prepared to offer your ferret a
safe place to adequately play away from all your other pets. (See Chapter 7
for more on introducing your ferret to other animals.)

Chapter 1: What You Need to Know About Ferrets

Leaping over the Legal Hurdles
You must be aware of the legal aspects of owning a ferret. Before you con-
sider the time, cost, adjustment, and olfactory aspects of ferret parenthood,
do some digging to be sure that ferrets are legal where you live. What
licenses may you need? What restrictions does your local government place
on pet owners?
It’s truly heartbreaking to lose a ferret to legal snags after investing so much
time and love. Fortunately, I haven’t experienced this pain firsthand, but I do
shed tears when I read the emotional testimonies of people who’ve lost legal
battles and ultimately their beloved fuzzies. For more information about the
legal issues that govern owning a ferret, head to Chapter 3.

t’s important to discuss domestication when it comes to ferrets; the issue
is at the center of a ferret’s identity. Some people hold the mistaken belief
that ferrets are wild animals, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.
Lumping them in with wild animals for regulatory purposes is, in my opinion,
a crime (for more, see Chapter 3). In reality, ferrets are domesticated pole-
cats, which means they’re descendants of wild polecats that were domesti-
cated by humans. This chapter will teach you about what it means to be
domesticated and why ferrets are domesticated. It’s really quite interesting.
You also discover in this chapter that ferrets are endearing critters that come
in a multitude of colors and patterns, which I explain in detail. But ferret
types don’t end at colors. In your search for a ferret you may come across an
angora or even a ferret-polecat hybrid, so this chapter prepares you a little
for that unusual and exciting encounter. But you’re not likely to encounter
the ferret’s rare and extremely endangered cousin, the black-footed ferret. So
I’ll introduce you to him here. You’ll get to know about his plight and the
heroic efforts of a group of people to reintroduce him back into the wild.
This chapter also burrows through the past and takes you into the present,
taking note of historical ferret sightings — some of which are more like halluci-
nations. You find out why people prized the beloved ferret so much in the first
place, and that common folk weren’t the only ones who enjoyed the company
of weasels. You also get a brief lesson on the art of ferreting, as well as a stern
lecture on why your ferret should hunt only within the safety of your home.

22
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 
Yes, Ferrets Are Domesticated
Domestication is a long process in which people selectively breed wild animals
in captivity for human benefit. There are three main criteria for domestication:
 Humans select the animals to be bred; the animals can’t select mates
themselves.
In the case of unaltered pet ferrets, their breeding is under complete
control of humans. People not only pair up the ferrets, but also can and
sometimes do tell them when and when not to breed by using light
cycles. They can take ferrets out of season by using vasectomized males
or drugs so that they can’t reproduce. Humans can even have ferrets
produce multiple litters per year or prevent them from having any litters
in a year.
 The animal experiences some type of genetic change that reflects the
human selection and distinguishes it from its wild counterparts.
Domestication has caused profound changes to ferret behavior:
• Domesticated ferrets by nature don’t fear humans.
• They demonstrate prolonged litter behaviors toward other ferrets,
which allows them to be housed with other ferrets.
• They demonstrate play behavior into late adulthood.
Will the ferret’s real daddy please stand up?
A huge amount of mystery and controversy 
surrounds our little ferret friends’ history — 
perhaps because all polecat groups are very
closely related and can interbreed successfully
(that is, they can produce viable hybrids).
Nobody really knows how the ferret is related
to the rest of the polecats, except that it is a
domesticated polecat, and the European pole-
cat (Mustela putorius) and the steppe polecat
(Mustela eversmanni) may be involved. The
most commonly accepted among several theo-
ries points toward the European polecat as
having the most likely claim to ferret ancestry.
Although scientists have found little archeolog-
ical evidence to support this idea, genetically
speaking, today’s ferret and the entire polecat
group Subgenera Putorius (Mustela evers-
manni, Mustela putorius, and Mustela nigripes)
are practically twins. The most likely conclusion
is that the domestic ferret is a polecat hybrid.
But even a seemingly insignificant genetic dis-
crepancy can mean the difference between a
horse and a zebra or a dog and a coyote.
So, the studies move forward. However, it’s quite
possible that we may never know the real ances-
try in our lifetime or in any other lifetime. For your
purposes, all you truly need to know is that you’re
dealing with a unique little creature — more
affectionate than ferocious, and so easy to fall in
love with.

In addition to behavioral changes, the domesticated ferret features
extreme changes to fur color when compared to wild polecats. Ferrets
can be bred for a multitude of colors and patterns, and albinism occurs
frequently.
 Humans derive some benefit from the domestication of the animal.
People domesticated ferrets to be mousers because they wanted a pole-
cat that could hunt mice and be predictably tame toward humans. By the
end of the domestication process, that’s exactly what they had. In the
past and still today, people used ferrets in the sport of ferreting to hunt
rabbits. Ferret domestication has also benefited humans in the areas of
fur production, experimental science, and, of course, companionship.
Some domestication scientists would add a fourth bullet indicating tameness
as a criterion, but not all domesticated animals are tame, which I can attest
to as a keeper of wild animals. And some wild animals are tame, so tameness
is relative.
Getting to Know Fuzzies 
in the Past and Present
Domesticated ferrets have been around for about 2,500 years and have stolen
the hearts of such people as Queen Elizabeth I and comedian Dick Smothers.
They were avid sailors during the American Revolutionary war, and they’ve
been skilled hunters from the time of domestication until now. It seems their
talents abound. Since domesticating ferrets, people have found many uses for
this wonderful animal, though it wasn’t until several decades ago that the
ferret actually started catching on as a lovable pet.
Ferrets throughout history
Tracking the ferret’s timeline is both factually difficult and headache induc-
ing. Many sources cite the people of Egypt as the original domesticators of
ferrets, but we have no proof that this theory is true. Egyptian hieroglyphics
portray images of weasel-like creatures, but several animals can fit the
description — the mongoose being one of them. Prior to the domestication of
the cat, the mongoose held the high esteem of snake catcher and keeper 
of the house in Egypt — and does so still today. Experts can logically con-
clude that these hieroglyphics don’t show ferrets at all, but rather another
animal native to the land. After all, you haven’t seen reports of ferret mum-
mies being discovered in Egypt, have you? And the Egyptians seemingly
mummified everything! Additionally, the hieroglyphics date back almost 500
years prior to the domestication of the cat, which happened about 4,000
years ago.
23
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

The first known written reference to an animal likely to be the domesticated
ferret popped up around 400 BC and was penned by the Greek satirical writer
Aristophanes (448–385 BC). Later, in 350 BC, the Greek naturalist and philoso-
pher Aristotle (384–322 BC) penned another reference. A ferret supposedly
made an appearance in the Bible, but it turned out to be a mistake in transla-
tion. The word in question, translated correctly, means “small crawling
things”; in modern day translations, it means “gecko.”
Experts estimate that the ferret was introduced to North America a little
more than 300 years ago. But only recently (in about the past 30 years) have
most pet owners discovered the ferret’s “fetching” personality.
Ferrets have always had a knack 
for meeting man’s needs
Earlier civilizations must have found the ferret to be quite the efficient exter-
minator, because Caesar Augustus received a request around 60 BC to sail
several ferrets to the Balearic Islands to control the rabbit population. And
ferrets are no strangers to the seas; during the American Revolutionary War,
several ferrets would roam the ships at sea to patrol for rodents. In fact, one
ship was named after a ferret: In an 1823 newspaper article, a U.S. schooner,
The Ferret, was reported to be chasing (capturing) pirates. People also used
the small, flexible critters to navigate wire, cable, and tools through small
openings and tunnels.
You can find many more documented reports on the use of ferrets to control
pests and hunt small game. Supposedly, two of the greatest ferret keepers
were German Emperor Frederick II (1194–1250) and Genghis Khan
(1167–1227), ruler of the Mongol empire. The hunting of small game is called
ferreting — a word still used today, both literally and figuratively (see the
upcoming ferreting section for more on the topic).
Ferrets catching on
Ferrets have tunneled their way into the lives of many historical figures —
from Caesar Augustus, who was asked for the working ferrets’ services to rid
an island of rabbits, to Queen Elizabeth I, who had a portrait done with one of
her royal fuzzies. Ferrets have been frequent subjects of famous artists, such
as Leonardo da Vinci. Other famous ferret humans include comedian Dick
Smothers and actor Dave Foley. Ferrets have even weaseled into the theater,
play roles in such movies as Kindergarten Cop, Garfield, Tale of Two Kitties,
Starship Troopers, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and Beastmaster, to mention
just a few.
24
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

Ferrets have made brief appearances on some television shows. For instance,
Dr. Wendy Winsted and her ferrets Melinda and McGuinn made a guest
appearance on what was then called Late Night with David Letterman. They
(the ferrets) performed the roll-over trick for a lap of milk and a bite of a
stagehand’s roast beef sandwich.
Ferrets also are a common source of punch lines and jokes. Take, for exam-
ple, the television series M*A*S*H. Major Frank Burns was often referred to
as “ferret face.” I’m not sure where the insult lies, though. And David
Letterman has frequently used the ferret in his Top Ten lists. I suppose I can
see some humor in it. After all, I have some very weaselly friends. They know
who they are!
Spotlighting the Sport of Ferreting
The sport of ferreting — hunting small game with ferrets — probably developed
hand in hand with the domestication of the ferret. The ferret keeper, or ferret-
meister (similar to a wisenheimer), would release a couple ferrets near rabbit
burrows and send them in to find the game. Like today’s pointers and other gun
dogs, working ferrets wore bells placed on their collars so their keepers could
track them. The ferret’s job wasn’t to hunt; it was simply supposed to chase the
rabbit or other game out of its burrow. Often, the fleeing animal became entan-
gled in nets that keepers used to prevent escape. The hunter then killed the
prey with a club or gun or used dogs or hawks to catch the game.
Sometimes, a ferret would stay in the hole, eat its share of the catch, and
then go to sleep! The aggravated keeper would have to send in another ferret
tethered to a line to locate and awaken the stuffed, sleepy ferret. The keeper
would then follow the line and dig out the ferrets and what was left of the car-
cass. Another option was to cover up all the exit holes except for one, set a
mink trap, and hope the thieving ferret would be caught by morning.
Ferret keepers were sometimes poachers. The poachers would hide the ferret
in his pants and take the fuzzy out at night to hunt. Poachers were possibly
the first large-scale pet ferret owners. This makes sense if you consider that a
poacher would typically spend more time bonding with and socializing his
ferrets to reduce the risk of getting caught. As ferreting became more popular
and the ferret gained respect, highly educated people took up the sport, and
most people kept their ferrets in conditions far superior to what most people
at that time experienced.
Many people in Australia and Europe still enjoy the sport of ferreting (see
Figure 2-1); however, it’s illegal in the United States and Canada.
25
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

I don’t advise trying your hand at the sport of ferreting for many reasons:
 It’s illegal.
 Your ferret can get lost, maybe even for good.
 You may expose your ferret to a disease.
 It’s cold, dark, and scary in those rabbit burrows (to me, anyway).
 Your ferret would prefer to be cuddled up with you in a safe, warm house.
 Your ferret can drown in water-filled burrows.
 Hey, what did a rabbit ever do to you?
Although traditional ferreting is illegal in the United States, fuzzies remain quite
the charmers and are beloved snatchers of our small worldly possessions.
Exploring the Hot Topic of Ferret Hybrids
The subject of ferret hybrids is a hotly debated topic in many ferret circles.
Very simply put, a hybrid is a cross between a domestic animal and its wild
counterpart — in this case, a ferret and a polecat. A hybrid can have just a
smidge of wild blood or a whole lot of it, depending on the breeding. In the
same mold, behavioral and physical traits are diluted or concentrated,
depending on the breeding.

26
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

What kind of pet does the average ferret hybrid make? Is the result a ferret or
a polecat? Some say the animal is neither, claiming it’s a confused critter
stuck in the middle, belonging neither in the wild nor in captivity, thus the
ethical and moral dilemma. The fuzzy is neither wild nor domesticated. Other
people disagree, saying that the confusion lies between the handler and the
animal. They argue that properly socialized hybrids — especially those with
low polecat content — can be content, happy, and playful in captivity.
So, what are the benefits of hybridization? Why do people do it (and who does
it)? And what are the cons? The following sections break down the issue.
The pros of and arguments 
for ferret hybridization
You must examine what it is that makes people attracted to the ferret hybrid
in the first place. Do they honestly believe that a hybrid is a good household
pet? Do people just desire a little piece of the wild? Is it fair? Experienced
owners can’t emphasize enough that ferret hybrids definitely aren’t for the
inexperienced or uneducated. Other than just wanting a piece of the wild in
your living room, what’s the benefit to breeding and owning hybrids? Some
argue that if done responsibly and correctly, hybrid breeding can enhance
existing ferret bloodlines and make ferrets healthier, hardier, and sounder by
introducing polecat blood into the mix. Responsible and educated owners
love their hybrids and seem to understand them quite well.
Having had a ferret hybrid, I can attest to the fact that they’re not for begin-
ners. In fact, mine was a rescue that came from an inexperienced person who
didn’t do her research before purchasing this beautiful animal. She didn’t
properly socialize him, and she had the bites to prove it. I sit on the fence
with this issue and tend to lean towards advising people not to get hybrids as
pets. They’re too difficult to work with, especially high-percentage hybrids,
and it’s just not fair to the animal. A small percentage of people out there can
properly handle ferret hybrids and keep them the way they need to be kept. I
also believe there are some breeders out there that can knowledgeably use
polecats to enhance the ferret species as a whole. Do all breeders know how
to do this? No. Ferreting out the good people is difficult, so I remain skeptical
of all who breed ferret hybrids and want to own them as pets. Ferret owners
must think long and hard before making such a decision to keep these often
misunderstood and easily mishandled beauties.
A hybrid ferret certainly has some benefits:
 A hybrid is a beautiful animal. They often bear beautiful, dark markings
and have stocky, muscular bodies (see the following section for more on
ferret appearances).
27
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

 Hybrids have much better eyesight than non-hybrids, and they rely
more on eyesight than domesticated ferrets do.
 They have extraordinary physical capabilities.
 They are very dominant and independent in most situations.
Owners of hybrids also report that they require a rigorous enrichment rou-
tine due to their higher energy and curiosity levels. Hybrids are intelligent
buggers that map and survey their areas much more quickly than ferrets,
which also causes them to become bored more easily. And when hybrids are
done exploring down low, they climb to the higher levels and explore!
Putting a hybrid in the hands of an uneducated owner often leads to an
abused, isolated animal and a frustrated, possibly injured owner. You simply
can’t treat a hybrid like a ferret. For example, you can’t scruff them (grab
them by the hair on the neck). And you can’t pass them around to your
friends! Exhibiting dominance over a hybrid is a no-no. Successful interaction
comes when you reach a mutual understanding and level of respect. Knowing
how to read the hybrid’s body language and respond appropriately is key as
well (see Chapter 18 for more on ferret body language). See the following sec-
tion for a rundown of the cons of hybridization.
The cons of hybridization
Most ferret-polecat offspring — especially those with a high percentage of
polecat blood — display the characteristics of the wild polecat, which cer-
tainly isn’t favorable in a captive environment. Hybrids, in general, display
the following characteristics:
 They’re shy and fearful of humans.
 They’re less social and less willing to live in groups.
 They typically don’t make good working ferrets (where ferreting is legal,
they won’t enter unfamiliar holes or burrows like domesticated ferrets do).
 They frighten easily, are cautious, and hide at the slightest new sound or
sight.
 They don’t tolerate new people or being held, and they’re quick to bite if
they feel uncomfortable.
 They don’t tolerate being caged very well; they need a lot of room to
roam and explore on a daily basis. Ferret-proofing can be quite challeng-
ing, and the result is that hybrids are very accident-prone in a household.
 Their mentality makes them more challenging; they’re more emotional,
sensitive, and higher strung than the non-hybrid.
28
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

What type of people should consider owning a hybrid? Should anyone?
Here’s what Dr. June McNicholas, BSc PhD, says about the topic: “It’s taken
centuries of selective breeding to produce the sociable, gregarious, outgoing
domestic ferret from the shy, solitary and largely unmanageable polecat. So
why try to reintroduce the very qualities that it’s taken so long to remove?”
Although Dr. McNicholas is ethically against the breeding of hybrid ferrets,
she says, “For those people who decide to explore the options, I would say
that the common sense rules apply when selecting a [hybrid] kit. Is it
healthy? Is it happy to be handled by its owner and by you? Is it full of curios-
ity and confidence, and ready to explore its surroundings? If so, fine. It may
not be a hybrid at all! If so, what are you prepared to pay?” And I dare say
that she isn’t just speaking in regards to financial price.
Picturing the Physical Appearance 
of the Domestic Ferret
Ferrets — those long, slender beauties — come in a variety of colors and pat-
terns. Colors range from the easily recognized albino with her white fur and
pink eyes, to the dark-eyed white (DEW) with her white coat and dark eyes,
to the darker sables and all shades in between. As if colors weren’t enough,
ferrets also come in color patterns, which have to do with color concentra-
tions or placement of white markings. Eye colors, mask shapes, and even
nose colorings play roles in how your ferret may be classified. Color, how-
ever, should be the last factor in picking out your new ferret.
Ferret people are coming up with more and more definitions of coat colors and
patterns all the time (maybe just to confuse the general public!), but many
basic colors and patterns are defined for you. I present these in the sections
that follow.
The spectrum of fuzzy colors
Every ferret has a color, and in that color is a pattern. Some colors and pat-
terns change from season to season, and others will stay the same. Personally,
when it comes to colors, I go by The American Ferret Association Standards.
So, unless you bought a neon ferret, your fuzzy will most likely fall into one of
the following categories that most ferret enthusiasts seem to agree on. (Note:
These colors are show standards, so most ferrets won’t match 100 percent.)
Refer to the color photos in the middle of this book to see some of these ferret
colors in their full glory!
29
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

Groups of ferret experts argue over the names of shades of sables and silvers.
You may find that one group calls one shade a fancy name and another group
calls it something different. No matter how many color names the experts
come up with, some ferrets will be lighter or darker than what their defini-
tions specify. So, it seems the definitions may never end.
 Albino: Resulting from a lack of pigment in the skin and eyes, albino fer-
rets range from a creamy white to a preferred snow-white color — both
on the guardhairs and undercoat. All albinos have light- to medium-pink
eyes, with ruby being preferred, and pink noses.
 Black: The black ferret is absolutely stunning. His guardhairs are truly
black in color. His undercoat is white or has a light golden cast, and his
eyes are black or near black, with a nose to match. A speckled black
nose also is acceptable.
 Black sable: This ferret is such a dark brown that he actually appears
black. He has a white or cream undercoat that barely shows through the
dark guardhairs. His eyes should be dark brown to near black, with a
nose to match. A heavily mottled (marbled), blackish brown nose is
acceptable as well.
 Champagne: This ferret is a light to medium tan or a diluted chocolate.
His undercoat is white to creamy in color, and his eyes are light to dark
burgundy. Like the chocolate, the champagne ferret’s nose should be
pink, with or without the brown/beige “T” outline.
 Chocolate: The chocolate ferret’s coat is another shade variation
of sable, but in a tasty shade of milk-chocolate brown. The ferret’s under-
coat has a golden cast to it or is white. His eyes are almost always brown
but can be dark burgundy as well. The chocolate’s nose is pink, with or
without the brown “T” outline; it can also be beige or brick in color.
 Cinnamon: The cinnamon’s coat is a very beautiful shade of light reddish
brown. His undercoat has a golden cast to it or is white. The ferret’s eyes
are light to medium burgundy. His nose may be pink, but a pinkish/beige
nose with a brick colored “T” outline (or completely brick-colored nose)
is preferred. However, many experts argue that true red cinnamons don’t
exist any longer.
 Dark-eyed white (DEW): This category is one of my favorites. These
beauties resemble albinos because of their white or creamy coats and
pink noses. The exception is their eye color, which is a dark burgundy.
The DEW pattern has 10 percent or less colored guardhairs in the form
of a stripe, colored tail, spots, or a sprinkling throughout the coat.
The DEW ferret and DEW pattern are prone to deafness. Waardensburg
Syndrome is a ferret condition that genetically links the white fur on the
head to deafness (similar to the condition of deafness in many blue-eyed
white cats). In addition to dark-eyed whites, pandas and shetlands/blazes
(other ferret pattern types; see the following section) are often prone to
deafness, though this isn’t always the case. Note: Deaf ferrets make fine
30
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

pets if you take extra care to properly train them and be careful not to
startle them.
 Sable: This ferret color is probably the most common. The guardhairs
are a rich, deep brown, and they’re evenly and densely dispersed. The
undercoat on the neck, back, and belly is white or cream colored. The
eyes are brown or close to black, and the nose is light or dappled brown.
The nose may also have a brown “T” outline.
Guardhairs are the stiffer, longer, and more prominent pieces of fur that
cover the shorter and softer undercoat. Guardhairs provide the ferret’s
coloration or camouflage and aid in waterproofing the fur. The undercoat
also act as insulation.
Fuzzy color patterns
Ferret patterns are used to describe color concentrations and white markings
on the ferret’s body. With patterns, the main discriminating factors are the
legs and tail, or points, and how the point color or mask shape (see below)
relates to the rest of the body color. The following list presents the most com-
monly recognized ferret patterns. Flip to the color photos in the center of this
book to see what some of these look like!
 Blaze: These ferrets usually have smudges or rings of color around their
eyes rather than masks. Small masks are acceptable, but full masks are
not. A white blaze extends from the face up over the head and hopefully
down the ferret’s neck to the shoulders. All four of his feet have mitts or
white tips; sometimes his knees are also white. Bibs, white or mottled
bellies, and roaning may also be present. He should have ruby or brown
eyes, and his nose should be pink (with or without a lighter outline).
 Mitts: Ferrets with mitts look like their paws have been dipped in white
marshmallow fluff. They also have white bibs. A mitt’s colors and pat-
terns should be appropriate for his standards. The eyes should be a
varying shade of burgundy, and the color standard should determine
nose color. Knee patches and a tail tip may or may not be present.
 Panda: Ferrets of any color that have white heads, necks, and throats.
Some pandas have “rings” around their eyes, which is acceptable; all
pandas should have four white mitts (or paws). Bibs and knee patches
(yes, ferrets have knees) may be present, as well as a white tip on the
tail. His eyes should be a shade of burgundy, and his nose should be
pink (with or without a lighter outline).
 Roan: This ferret almost has an even mixture of colored and white
guardhairs. Typically, you want to see 50 to 60 percent colored and 40 to
50 percent white hairs. The color and pattern will determine the mask
he needs to wear, along with his nose. For instance, a black roan mitt
can have a hood or regular mask.
31
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

 Siamese or point: These are ferrets of any color that have much darker
points than body color. His mask is shaped like a thin letter V.
Champagne versions of this ferret may have no mask (see the previous
section for more on colors). The nose should be light in color, such as
pink or beige, or have a “T” outline.
 Solid: The solid ferret is slightly more concentrated in color than the
standard ferret — ideally, 100 percent of the guardhairs will be colored.
This means that you can’t distinguish his points from the rest of his
body, because the ferret’s outer coat is solid in color. He should have a
full T-bar mask and a nose color appropriate for his coat color (see the
previous section).
 Standards: This ferret pattern is perhaps the most common. The per-
centage of colored guardhairs should be approximately 90 to 100 com-
pared to the white guardhairs present. The body appears lighter in color
than the points (the legs and tail), which makes the points easily distin-
guishable from the rest of the body. Standards should have nose colors
appropriate for their body colors standard and full or T-bar masks.
Hey! Where did my “silver” and “silver mitt” go? The silver, according to The
American Ferret Association, is considered a “black roan.” And you guessed
it: The silver mitt is now the “black roan mitt.”
Not Just Another Color: The 
Black-Footed Ferret
The black-footed ferret, known as Mustela nigripes, is a small, carnivorous
predator that lives in the wild and weighs between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds
(0.7–1.1 kg) — approximately the same size as the mink and our domesti-
cated fuzzy, or slightly larger than the weasel. In captivity, he may live as 
long as nine years, two to three times longer than expected in the wild. See
Figure 2-2 to see what a black-footed ferret looks like. Compare it to Figure 1-1
in Chapter 1 to see how different the black-footed ferret looks from the
domestic ferret. Refer also to the photo in the color insert.
The black-footed ferret arrived in North America as an efficient predator, but
it was in North America that he evolved into the specialized predator of
prairie dogs. The black-footed ferret is known to be the only native North-
American ferret and is the smallest of the polecats.
The black-footed ferret is considered by most to be one of the rarest mammals
in the United States and perhaps the entire world. What has caused such a
skilled hunter and cousin to our domestic ferret to earn such a title? It’s no
doubt that the plight of the black-footed ferret was caused both directly and
indirectly by the human race. Sadly, his future remains uncertain.
32
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

This section describes the physical traits of the black-footed ferret and how
our domestic ferret stands up in comparison. Here you also find an overview
on how the black-footed ferret compares to our domestic ferret, where the
black-footed ferret came from, where he’s been, and where he’s heading.
The one, true North American ferret!
The black-footed ferret adapted in North America long before the ferret was
even domesticated. A close relative of the Siberian polecat, mustela evers-
manii, the ancestral black-footed ferret is thought to have come from north-
east Asia, crossing at the point now known as the Bering Strait, between
Russia and Alaska. The actual time period he scampered into North America
remains uncertain. The estimates date as far back as 1 million years ago to as
recent as 100,000 years ago.
Are black-footed ferrets really 
that different?
Black-footed ferrets and our domesticated fuzzies share many similar physi-
cal features, body size, and behaviors. Skeletally speaking, they’re almost
identical. Small differences appear in the skull. The domestic ferret has a
shorter and more-rounded head and a slightly smaller nose. The domestic
ferret’s smaller ears give it an appearance of having a more pointed snout
than the black-footed ferret. Both have strong front paws for digging and bur-
rowing. The black-footed ferret has a more tubular tail unlike the tapered tail
of the domestic ferret. It also has noticeably larger nocturnal eyes and
Figure 2-2:
A black-
footed

33
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

broader ears needed for extra keen senses, along with a noticeably longer
neck than the domestic ferret.
The black-footed ferret’s nose is almost always solid black. He also always
has the distinctive black feet, legs, and tip of tail. While our domestic ferrets
can vary a great deal in color, shade, and pattern, only limited variations in
shade of body color exist in the black-footed ferret. Always present is a white,
cream, or buff full bib and a saddle of brown on his back. The saddle area is
filled in with dark-tipped guard hairs that are lighter towards the roots of the
hairs. Fur generally becomes lighter in shade towards and on the belly. All
areas of brown can vary from light medium to dark depending on season and
individual animal. Also very prominent on the black-footed ferret and almost
all polecats is a white spot just above the top inner corner of each eye.
Habitat (or is that prairie dog?) 
destruction
The black-footed ferret’s range was as vast as the prairie dog’s. They thrived
only where prairie dogs thrived, covering over 700 million acres. From southern
Canada to northern Mexico, the prairie dog colonies were the life source for the
black-footed ferret. Making up 90 percent of the black-footed ferret’s diet, the
prairie dog also furnished essential burrows, which were vital in providing shel-
ter to the black-footed ferret. These burrows were safe havens that kept out the
extreme weather and protected the black-footed ferret from predators. The bur-
rows were also convenient places to whelp and rear offspring safely.
So with the essential presence of millions of prairie dogs inhabiting the territo-
ries, what could possibly push the black-footed ferret to the edge of extinction?
The most devastating human actions leading to the demise of the black-
footed ferret weren’t against the ferret at all but, rather, its food source — the
prairie dog. Prairie dog colonies were viewed by local residents with extreme
abomination for many reasons. Ranchers complained that the colonies com-
peted with the local livestock for vital food. Agriculturists argued that they
destroyed the land. As frequent carriers of sylvatic plague, introduced to
North America by none other than the human animal, prairie dogs were also
considered extreme health risks to nearby humans.
Prairie dogs knew as well as people where the best living environment was.
The locals didn’t want their peaceful neighbors, and with the help of the U.S.
government, that lead to rapid decimation of prairie dog populations.
The most reckless attack on the prairie dog came in the form of mass poison-
ing. Cans of cyanide gas were tossed into the burrows, or strychnine pellets
were left disguised as treats. Contaminated carcasses were often eaten,
34
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

which killed unaware diners, including black-footed ferrets, wolves, and
eagles to name a few. Other animals inhabiting the burrows fell victim to
these cruel assaults as well. The prairie dogs that survived the various
strikes lost their habitat to land-clearing machines such as the bulldozer.
Experts estimate that up to 99 percent of the once-vast prairie dog range
remains cleared of these peaceful critters, leaving only a few million acres
with surviving colonies. In fact, legal poisoning and shooting of prairie dogs
continues to this day.
With the black-footed ferret’s food source practically decimated, its demise
rapidly grew closer. In 1960, people realized that the black-footed ferret popu-
lation might be in danger, but by then it was too late. By the mid-1960s, the
first in-depth studies began to indicate how grim the future looked for the
black-footed ferret. In 1967, the black-footed ferret became legally protected —
only 116 years after being given its official scientific name in 1851 by John
James Audubon and John Bachman. And in 1973, the black-footed ferret was
one of the first animals to be placed on the current Endangered Species List.
The last wild black-footed ferret was initially thought to have been seen in
1974, but a small group was discovered in Wyoming in 1981 after a dog pre-
sented an unusual and unfortunately dead animal to its bewildered human.
The newly discovered colony flourished and reached almost 130 animals.
However, the population was destroyed by 1985. Turns out that 50 percent of
the prairie dog population feeding this hopeful Wyoming ferret colony tested
positive for the rodent-decimating sylvatic plague, known to humans as
bubonic plague, killing both prairie dogs and ferrets.
Even more tragic was the fact that canine distemper, 100 percent fatal to
black-footed ferrets, swept through the fragile group. This was as big a factor
in wiping out the black-footed ferret as was plague. The race was then on to
capture the remaining wild black-footed ferrets. There we were! Only eighteen
ferrets were left in 1987. They stood on the brink of extinction again. Between
1985 and 1987, the very last 18 black-footed ferrets were rescued. The last-
known wild ferret was taken alive in February 1987 in Wyoming — that is,
before the reintroduction of the critters began taking place.
The Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan
The monumental goal of the Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan, developed
and approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1988, is to establish no
less than ten geographically separate populations of wild, self-sustaining
black-footed ferrets. This plan calls for the establishment of 1,500 breeding
wild black-footed ferrets in order for the species to be removed from the
endangered species list.
35
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

With the dedicated help of member organizations of The Black-Footed Ferret
Recovery Implementation Team (BFFRIT), created in 1996, this goal is slowly
being recognized. These organizations work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and act as advisory teams. According to their Web site, www.black
footedferret.org: “Through a team effort, the agencies and partners
involved on the Black-footed Ferret Recovery Implementation Team will pro-
mote strategic public awareness, understanding, and support, resulting in the
successful recovery of the black-footed ferret and the conservation of the
ecosystem upon which it depends.”
Once thought to be extinct in 1980, more than 5,000 have been produced in
captivity since 1987. Responsible for this are: Louisville Zoo, Toronto Zoo,
The National Zoo, The Phoenix Zoo, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, and The
National Black-Footed Ferret Conservation Center. More than 2,500 have been
released into the wild since 1991. Approximately 700 exist today. The people
responsible for the Recovery Program have gained a greater understanding
of captive breeding and have even begun to use such means as artificial
insemination (AI). Maybe that number will double or even triple in another 
25 years.
Captive breeding
Only since 1991 have attempts been made to reintroduce this species into the
wild through captive-breeding efforts. In the beginning, these efforts were
met with sobering obstacles. From the limited gene pool of only 18 captive
black-footed ferrets, to the inability to successfully rehabilitate captive-
reared juveniles into the wild, to the lack of habitat for release, the future
looked grim for the black-footed ferret.
Today things are looking up because much has been learned about raising
black-footed ferrets in captivity. Although black-footed ferrets retain some
instincts, such as killing and eating prairie dogs, burrowing, and recognizing
and avoiding predators, those instincts aren’t as sharp as they would be had
they been born in the wild. After all, they’ve been in captivity for 20 years!
For this reason, captive-born kits are now sent to survival boot camp for a
month and a half to learn how to survive in the wild. Living in semi-natural,
but protected, communities, the ferrets are allowed to sharpen their skills by
interacting with live prairie dogs and living in real burrows. Preconditioning
routines and procedures such as these have increased the survival rate of
captive-born kits released into the wild threefold. Additionally, some sites
have even been successful at transferring wild ferrets from one site to
another, which is important for maintaining genetic distribution.
36
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

Progress being made
In the beginning years, only three states participated in releases: Wyoming,
South Dakota, and Montana. Today things are quite different. In the U.S.,
there are now 10 different black-footed ferret reintroduction sites located in
six different states: Arizona, Colorado, Utah, South Dakota, Wyoming, and
Montana. Mexico also participates in the reintroduction project. Currently
Kansas and Canada are being pursued as possible sites, and the list is grow-
ing. The sites must be located where significant prairie dog towns still exist,
so this means mainly federal, state, and tribal lands.
Hurdles in recovery
Nothing worth doing is ever easy. Some things are in man’s control, while
other things aren’t. Although significant progress has been made in The
Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan, several challenges still remain.
Unfortunately, all must be conquered in order to win the battle of the black-
footed ferret.
 Political: This is perhaps the biggest and longest-standing threat facing
the black-footed ferret. It’s not even against the ferret itself, but rather
against its food source — the prairie dog. The biggest myth is that live-
stock suffer broken legs from stepping in prairie dog burrows. The fact
is, cows aren’t that stupid.
People also don’t want their livestock competing for grassland. There
are even state laws that mandate you eradicate prairie dogs from your
land. The county will do it if you don’t and then send you a bill later!
Political pressure still exists to poison prairie dogs even on America’s
public lands. No prairie dogs. No food. No ferrets.
 Biological: Black-footed ferrets are highly susceptible to both plague
and also canine distemper. With the exception of South Dakota, which
has never had plague, all states have had outbreaks in prairie dogs. The
Recovery Program is currently experimenting with a human plague vac-
cine to protect the black-footed ferret. Each ferret caught is given a
series of two shots over a two week period. Although this vaccinates the
ferrets, it doesn’t help the prairie dogs. So, they hope to come up with
an oral vaccine to mass vaccinate the prairie dogs.
 Economic: This hurdle comes up almost everywhere help is needed.
There simply isn’t enough money to keep people in place to do what’s
needed. Finding more sites to put ferrets on also takes money, and rais-
ing money takes money. Without funding, the Recovery Program is
doomed.
37
Chapter 2: Understanding What Ferrets Are (And Aren’t)

 Social: Public awareness and education are missing components to the
recovery program. How can anyone help a program they don’t under-
stand or even know about? Most people don’t even know what a black-
footed ferret even is. Says Travis Livieri of Prairie Wildlife Research,
“Wolves and grizzlies are two of the most widely recognized and cele-
brated endangered species, but nowhere as near as endangered as
black-footed ferrets.” The people responsible for the Recovery Program
need to do more public outreach. They need to view education as being
as important as the recovery process itself.
Black-footed ferrets are one of the most recoverable species on the endan-
gered species list. They’re the “panda” of the prairie. The prairie dog is the
keystone of the prairie. By preserving the prairie dog ecosystem, we’re not
only saving the black-footed ferret, we’re also saving the swift fox, burrowing
owl, ferruginous hawks, and mountain plover. They’re all directly linked to
prairie dogs. Bison and antelope also thrive in the prairie dog ecosystem. You
can make a difference in saving these animals.
Although the government recognizes that the survival of the black-footed
ferret depends directly on the survival of prairie dog colonies, the govern-
ment continues to support the mass killing of prairie dogs. It’s possible that
because the black-footed ferret is a specialized hunter and hasn’t adapted to
an alternate diet, people may soon lose these beautiful critters forever.
So, what can you do? First, you can learn about the prairie — what it is and
its history. Did you know that you own a part of the prairie? It doesn’t matter
where you live! Find out which zoos have black-footed ferrets, and visit one of
these magnificent creatures. Write to or call your local conservation office to
find out how you can become directly involved in the fight to save your local
prairies. And if you live in a state where prairie dogs reside, step forward and
take action. Find out what you can do to help protect the prairie dog’s future.

Ferrets and the Law: Licensing
and Other Issues
In This Chapter
 Addressing licensing issues
 Examining the existence and purpose of ferret-free zones
 Familiarizing yourself with ferret law
S
ome of you may be just beginning to develop a mild adoration of fuzzies;
others have a fully developed love for the creatures that have melted the
hearts of millions. The point is you care for the little critters, so it may sur-
prise you to learn that ferrets actually are illegal in some cities and in some
states as a whole. Places where ferrets aren’t welcome or are downright ille-
gal are called ferret-free zones. Likewise, ferret-friendly zones are places where
ferrets are safe from the politicians and other ferret haters. The classification
of your living area depends on how your local government categorizes the
ferret.
This chapter explains how you can find out whether having a fuzzy is legal
where you live. Obviously, you should obtain this information before you take
a ferret into your heart and home. You may be surprised to find out that you
may even need a license for your ferret, so I talk about that too. I also show
you the rationale behind outlawing these critters, and I present the ramifica-
tions of being caught red-handed with a fugitive furball.
“A License? But He Can’t Even
Reach the Pedals!”
Some cities and states require that owners obtain licenses or permits for
their ferrets. A license can be free (such as in my state of Illinois), or it can
cost as much as $100 per year. In some places, fees are per ferret, so be sure

you double-check the rules for your area by first calling your state’s depart-
ment of natural resources or fish and game department (whatever the state
department is called). Next check with the county animal regulations, and
finally your township. To get a license for your ferret, if even needed at all,
you must follow the procedures provided by your governing entity.
Some permits are just useless pieces of paper, but not all permits come free
of strings. For example, some require that you don’t have children under a
certain age in your household if you want to bring home a ferret, and some
require proof of vaccinations and/or neutering/spaying.
Some states and cities don’t regulate ferret ownership at all; however, that
doesn’t mean they look upon ferrets as welcome guests. Where ferret toler-
ance is low, confiscations or fines may be imposed routinely or randomly.
Unfortunately, some cities are very confused; they say that permits are nec-
essary to breed and/or sell ferrets but that it’s illegal to own them. Huh? It
can seem at times to be a conspiracy on the part of a few against the many
ferret lovers. This is something we must deal with; all you can do is arm your-
self with information, and jump through the necessary hoops.
Ferret-Free Zones and Why They Exist
Although the United States Department of Agriculture classifies ferrets as
domesticated critters, some rogue state agencies still insist that domestic fer-
rets are wild animals. Others say that ferrets aren’t wild animals but rather
exotic animals. Still others believe that ferrets are domesticated but hold
firmly to the idea that they’re dangerous. Well, I’m here to tell you, without a
doubt, the ferret is domesticated. But because many states regulate wild and
exotic animals, and these states lump in the poor ferret where it just doesn’t
belong, ferrets end up getting regulated or discriminated against.
For instance, California and Hawaii are the states that continue to outlaw fer-
rets (many military bases all over the country also ban furballs). However,
just because your state lists ferrets as legal doesn’t mean your city does.
Many major and some smaller cities remain in the dark ages as ferret-free
zones. (Check out the section “Knowing the Law and the Consequences of
Breaking It” to find out where to get this information.) While the lovable
ferret continues to get wrapped up in bureaucracy, dedicated ferret freedom
fighters continue to do their best to mow down misconceptions in the hopes
of protecting and legalizing ferrets everywhere.
You may wonder how ferrets — these captivating bundles of energy and joy —
can be such a source of controversy. It all lies in the myths and misconcep-
tions department, as the following sections explain.
40
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

What’s it gonna be? Wild,
domestic, or exotic?
Perhaps the biggest misconception about ferrets is that they’re wild or non-
domesticated animals — no different from the neighborhood skunks and 
raccoons. The truth is that ferrets are domesticated animals and have been
for thousands of years. Ferrets depend on their humans for survival, so how
can certain governments classify them as wildlife? The answer probably lies
in how scientists named them way back when.
Depending on your school of belief, the ferret is either a species all to itself
(Mustela furo) or a descendant of the wild European polecat (Mustela putorius
furo). The ferret is “scientifically” known by the latter distinction, which is
the legal glitch that many governments have used to classify fuzzies as
41
Chapter 3: Ferrets and the Law: Licensing and Other Issues
Californians unite!
One thing “ferret people” have in common is
their devotion to their beloved pet ferrets, and
Californians are no different. Being illegal in
their state means simply that they have to fight
harder for their rights and the rights of their
fuzzies. Several organizations have sprouted up
over the years to help change the regulations in
California; two especially are worth noting due
to their diligence in challenging the government
to get ferret ownership legalized:
 Ferrets 
Anonymous
(www.ferrets
anonymous.com) is a nonprofit grass-
roots organization made up of California
ferret enthusiasts who are working to 
promote awareness of the domestic ferret
in conjunction with their efforts toward
ferret legalization. Ferrets Anonymous 
publishes The FerretPaw Print, a bi-monthly
newsletter with legalization updates and 
informative articles. Ferrets Anonymous
has Chapters located all over California, so
you’re bound to find a Chapter nearby if you
live in that state.
 The Northern California Ferret Alliance
(www.ncferretalliance.org) is
another educational organization active in
ferret’s rights. I’ll let its Web site speak for
the organization: “The Northern California
Ferret Alliance is a nonprofit organization
dedicated to the domestic ferret and
the people who love them. The NCFA pro-
vides education to the local community
regarding ferret care, health concerns and
current legalization issues, support and
social events for local ferret enthusiasts as
well as fund raising for ferret rescue
organizations.”
Another Web site that contains great informa-
tion is that of the organization Californians for
Ferret Legalization. Although the organization
itself is now defunct, its Web site remains up
and running. This site contains more information
than any other in terms of the legal issues fer-
rets and their owners face in California. Visit the
site at www.ferretnews.org.

wildlife. Many labels come with being classified as “wildlife” — people believe
wildlife to be dangerous, unpredictable, and a disease risk. Most cities and
states deem wildlife illegal to keep or require special permits in situations of
ownership.
The scientific name of the fuzzy isn’t the only thing standing in your way in
many places:
 Some people consider ferrets to be wild because they look so much like
their cousins: the minks, weasels, and polecats. But just because you
may look like a famous athlete doesn’t make you part of his team, right?
 One of the world’s most endangered wildlife species, the black-footed
ferret, happens to have “ferret” in its name, though it is wild and our
ferret isn’t.
Feral ferrets in my neighborhood?
Perhaps the most outrageous misconception about owning ferrets — or
unfounded paranoia, actually — is the fear that pet ferrets will escape, unite
in the wild, form large feral (wild) colonies, and develop their own organized
crime rings. Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating a bit. But some governmental suits
actually believe the part about the development of feral colonies. These
politicians preach the idea that these colonies of roving feral ferrets will
destroy native wildlife and livestock.
Here are some reasons why the feral-ferret scenario is very unlikely:
 Ferrets are domestic animals (see the previous section), and they rely
on humans for survival.
 The majority of ferrets entering the pet trade are spayed or neutered.
 Ferrets are indoor pets and escape is unlikely.
Many species of domestic animals are capable of going feral, but for a colony
to form, their environment has to be just perfect for them, and they have to
have the necessary skills. In particular,
 There must be several feral breeders around to make more animals.
 There must be an open environmental niche.
North America has few open niches left for small predatory mammals
such as the ferret. The niches are already filled with more competitive
mustelids (a ferret’s cousins), such as the American mink and the long-
tailed weasel.
 The animal must know how to escape from predators and find food.
42
Part I: Is a Ferret Right for You? 

These are just a few of the many reasons why the likelihood of ferrets taking
over your environment is very small.
Should people fear rabies?
Zero reports have been made of a ferret transmitting rabies to a human, and
only a handful of cases of ferrets carrying rabies have ever been docu-
mented. In fact, dogs and cats are at much greater risk of being exposed to
rabies, thus putting you at greater risk. The following points should further
solidify your argument to others (and to yourself) that rabies isn’t a signifi-
cant risk in ferrets:
 Ferrets have little opportunity to come in contact with rabies-infected
animals in the first place.
 Infected ferrets are thought to carry dumb rabies and die quickly after
becoming infected. (To compare dumb rabies with furious rabies, see
Chapter 15.)
 Researchers are in the early stages of investigating the hypothesis that
ferrets don’t even pass the rabies virus through their saliva.
An approved rabies vaccine is available for ferrets to alleviate the fear of the
disease being present. Part of being a responsible ferret owner is having your
lovable fuzzball vaccinated on a yearly basis (see Chapter 12). Most cities
and states recognize the rabies vaccine developed for the ferret as being pro-
tective against rabies, so for your sake and your ferret’s, keep proof of her
vaccinations on hand. A bite from your ferret without proof of rabies vaccina-
tion can cost her her life.
Knowing the Law and the Consequences
of Breaking It
Ferret ownership isn’t legal or tolerated everywhere. You need to check with
an appropriate and knowledgeable agency before you bring home a fuzzy to
get the exact details pertaining to ferret ownership where you live. Doing so
can save your ferret’s life. A good way to find out whether your ferret is wel-
come in your city or living area is to call your local Fish and Game
Department, Department of Conservation, or Wildlife Department.
Another good source of information is your local humane society, because
it’s the society’s business to know the local laws pertaining to all animals. But
perhaps the best source of ferret law is your local ferret club or shelter, if
43
Chapter 3: Ferrets and the Law: Licensing and Other Issues

your area has one. This is probably the safest source that will give you the
most accurate information. After all, ferret people have the most invested
in keeping their ferrets safe. Finally, check with your veterinarian. He has
probably been treating ferrets and should know the general laws pertaining
to them.
Please, please don’t rely solely on the advice or opinion of a pet-shop
employee or breeder when it comes to ferret law. Even if these folks know
your local laws, they may not be forthcoming in providing accurate informa-
tion to potential buyers. This isn’t true of all pet-shop employees or breeders,
but why risk it? If you must ask one of these sources, be sure to get a second
and third opinion.
So, say you get caught red-handed breaking your local ferret laws. So what?
First of all, the danger to your little fuzzy is great. Some ferret-free zones
won’t hesitate to remove your furry family member from her safe, secure
home for good. If your ferret is lucky, she may get shipped to a shelter in a
ferret-friendly zone where her life can begin anew. If she’s unlucky, though,
her life will abruptly end — all because of your carelessness and unfortunate
misconceptions. Confiscation of your fuzzy is basically inevitable, but you
may also get slapped with fines. Some fines are pretty hefty — like $2,000 per
ferret offense.

M
ost people who want a ferret as a new family member have an
image of what the perfect ferret is. Friendly, sweet, loving, playful,
adventurous — those are just a few of the characteristics ferret lovers dream
about. But when it actually comes down to choosing a ferret for your home,
friendly, sweet, and all the other adjectives get you only so far. You also need
to think in terms of health, gender, and even age. And when you have all
those characteristics figured out, you should consider whether you want to
get more than one!
This chapter helps you choose the perfect ferret for your home and your
family. I explain what the normal and ideal traits are and warn about some
characteristics to avoid. Some sections talk about the differences in genders
and ages. You may be surprised by what you discover in this chapter! When
you have an idea of what type of ferret you’re looking for, you can start to
look in the right places to seek out your dream fuzzball. You have several
options to consider, all with pros and cons, and I cover them later in the
chapter.

Ferret Shopping 101
If you’re new to ferret ownership (welcome to the club!), it’s important to
choose a healthy ferret with a pleasant personality to bring into your home.
Only someone more experienced in ferret care should have the confidence to
care for a ferret that needs special attention. The following list presents some
tips to keep in mind when shopping for your new fuzzy friend:
 Her fur should be soft, shiny, and full. She should have no patches of
missing fur.
 Her eyes should be clear and bright. No discharge should be coming
from the eyes, ears, or nose.
 Her underside should be clean and healthy looking. Look for signs of
diarrhea or bloating, which can be evidence of parasites or illness.
 The ideal ferret is inquisitive when you approach; she doesn’t cower or
run to a hiding place. She should be jumpy and playful.
Don’t view nipping in a young ferret as a warning sign. Nipping is normal
for a youngster. However, you should avoid a ferret that bites aggres-
sively out of fear. You should be able to recognize the difference.
Problem ferrets hang on when they bite and draw blood.
 Color should be your last deciding factor because many coat colors and
patterns have a tendency to change and lighten over time.
Many wonderful breeder ferrets, pet-store ferrets, and shelter ferrets need
good homes. Some of these ferrets require special attention; most do not. For
information on finding your perfect ferret, see the section “Where to Find
Your Ferret” later in this chapter.

Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 
“But I felt so sorry for her . . .”
I can’t tell you how many people bring animals
to shelters, ferrets included, because they didn’t
think long enough about their decisions to take
on such a responsibility. I always ask people
why they acquired their pets in the first place
when they come to our shelter (I’m the curious
type), and many say that they felt sorry for the
animals. Getting a pet out of sympathy rarely
leads to a win-win situation. Caring for an
animal you know inside and out and have pre-
pared for is difficult enough; taking on an animal
that you know little about or that has underlying
problems can lead to frustration, anger, and a
sense of hopelessness.

Are You in the Market for 
a New or Used Ferret?
The decision you make about how old you want your ferret to be should be
based on your experience and lifestyle. Some people automatically think that
they should start off with baby ferrets; they have many reasons, some of
which just don’t make sense. The thought that you must begin with a baby so
that she’ll bond with you doesn’t hold true in the ferret world. Most adult fer-
rets adapt well to change and will love you no matter how long you’ve had
them. Other people like to use the “I want little Johnny and the ferret to grow
up together” reasoning.
The fact is, both adult and baby ferrets make good pets. The following sec-
tions help you make your decision.
Starting off with a kit
Baby ferrets, or kits, are absolutely adorable and hard to resist. They’re
delightfully bouncy and mischievous, with a seemingly endless supply of
energy. Adults have their fair share of spunk, but kits are just a tad bit more
energetic than their adult counterparts.
If you have small children, I recommend that a kit not be your first choice. If
you’re alone or have only one or two other adults in your household, and you
have a lot of extra attention to give, a kit may be just what you’re looking for.
If you don’t have small children, here are some things to know about kits
before you purchase one:
 Because kits are more active and playful, they can be more demanding
of your time. They’re also notoriously nippy while still in the learning
and testing stage.
Biting isn’t cute and shouldn’t be encouraged through play. It can get out
of hand and become a behavior issue if you don’t deal with it immedi-
ately. To find out how to deal with biting, see Chapter 20.
 You’ll need to train and socialize a kit. You’ll be the one who has to teach
a kit what is and isn’t acceptable.
 You’ll need to make sure that a kit has all her baby shots. Medically
speaking, a baby fuzzy should already have received her first distemper
shot by the time she goes home with you. She may need up to four
shots, depending on how old she is and what medicine she’s already
received (see Chapter 12 for details).
49
Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)

Adopting an older ferret
Adult ferrets make wonderful pets. You don’t have to purchase a ferret as a
baby to get her to bond with you. An adult ferret will love you and display all
the charisma and energy you could hope for. Unfortunately, thousands of
wonderful adult ferrets wait patiently in shelters for homes simply because
people believe that older ferrets are damaged in some way. Some people even
dare to think that the adults aren’t as cute as kits. I beg to differ! Almost all
the ferrets I’ve owned have been hand-me-down adults. And each one, with a
unique personality, melted my heart right away.
Families with smaller children, people looking for cuddlers, or even those of
you who believe in rescuing before purchasing would make excellent homes
for older ferrets. If this sounds like you and you’re thinking about adopting an
older ferret, keep the following points in mind:
 Because the life span of a ferret is relatively short (averaging 6 to 8
years), you may have less time to spend with an older or adult ferret.
This isn’t always the case, though. I’ve lost young ferrets to disease and
had some of my older adoptees live years beyond the normal expectancy.
The average life span is just something you may want to think about.
 Generally speaking, older ferrets seem to be more relaxed with them-
selves and wiser to their surroundings, but they’re still inquisitive and
mischievous. Unless they fall ill, most adults are wildly amusing and
playful. Some can get into just as much, if not more, trouble than their
young counterparts! Adult ferrets just seem to have had the edge 
taken off.
 Adult ferrets can be more set in their ways. Behavior difficulties, if they
exist, can be more challenging to correct. Some adult ferrets have been
neglected or abused, so they may need a little more understanding and
patience. On the other hand, adults that have been treated well (and
even many neglected and abused ferrets) adapt well to new environ-
ments and have little or no difficulty bonding with their new humans.
The majority of older ferrets have had at least one other caretaker. Most are
already trained to use the litter box (see Chapter 19) and have been taught
that nipping is unacceptable. However, adult ferrets that haven’t been prop-
erly socialized may bite out of fear. If you decide that an older ferret is right
for your home, take the time to play and socialize with the ferrets you con-
sider for adoption. It won’t take long to determine if any special needs exist,
and then you must decide if you’re capable of handling those needs.
50
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Should You Pre-Order Blue or Pink
Bedding (Get a Boy or Girl)?
A decision you have to make when looking to adopt a ferret is whether you
want a male or female. This should be a minor role in your decision, because
health and personality are the number one factors!
Females are called either jills (unspayed) or sprites (spayed). Males are called
either hobs (unneutered) or gibs (neutered).
Females typically are smaller and daintier than males. As boy ferrets mature,
they tend to become more cuddly and couch-potato-ish. Females tend to
remain more squirmish, as though they’d rather be anywhere else than in
your loving grasp. I hate to hold fast to this stereotype, however, because I’ve
had some females that were quite the opposite. Sometimes, all it takes to get
a ferret — particularly a girl — to settle down is a bit of human intervention,
such as rubbing her ear or another “grooming” gesture (see Chapter 9).
Unless they’re very sick or old, all ferrets are amusing bundles of energy with
a propensity to please and make trouble, regardless of gender.
Pitting Altered versus Whole Furballs
Most ferrets that enter the pet trade come from mass ferret producers, so
more than likely your ferret will already be neutered or spayed, negating a
choice on your part. Sometimes the only way to know for sure is by a tattoo
in the ear, though not all breeders tattoo their ferrets.
In the female ferret, spaying is a medical necessity. Unlike some mammals
that go into heat for short periods of time, the female ferret stays in heat 
until she’s bred. The unending heat cycle more often than not leads to a 
life-threatening condition called aplastic anemia. Spaying your ferret can 
save her life. In the male ferret, neutering is more of a behavioral necessity. 
It lessens aggression toward other male ferrets and urine marking on the
ground (which also dramatically decreases the odor of boys).
Aplastic anemia is a condition caused by high levels of the hormone estrogen,
which is produced when the ferret is in heat. A high level of estrogen sup-
presses the production of vital red and white blood cells in the bone marrow.
As the disease advances, this suppression becomes irreversible. Secondary
bacterial infections occur due to the lack of white blood cells to fight infec-
tion. The ferret’s blood can’t clot properly, so bleeding becomes a problem.
51
Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)

Severe anemia sets in and an insidious death follows. Signs can be seen in fer-
rets that have been in heat for a month, and they can remain in heat for up to
6 months if unbred. How long it takes for aplastic anemia to kill a ferret
depends on many variables.
If you plan to adopt a whole, or unaltered, ferret, you should have the altering
procedure done by the time the fuzzy is 6 months old, unless you’re planning
to breed her. Commercial breeders alter their babies as young as 6 weeks old.
Some people, however, suggest that males be altered as late as 12 months
and females as late as 9 months so that they can reach full growth.
Personally, I wait until 6 months for both the males and females.
Very few differences exist between altered male and altered female ferrets. In
fact, every altered ferret I’ve ever met had his or her own unique personality
that was unrelated to gender or age. All ferrets are amusing, hyper to various
degrees, and easy to please, as long as you meet their needs. The following
sections dig deeper into the behavior and characteristics of male and female
ferrets and how they relate to sexual maturation.
Boys will be boys
You can identify your male as whole if his testicles begin to drop (appear)
and his odor becomes stronger as the breeding period approaches. Like
many animals, from the prairie dog to the moose elk, unneutered ferrets
enter a period of breeding when all they can think about is passing on their
superior genetic makeup. For ferrets, this breeding cycle may start in the
spring and last six months, all the way until fall.
During the breeding season, males on the prowl can become aggressive
toward other whole male ferrets. During this period, a boy’s weight also can
fluctuate a great deal; he usually loses weight while staying preoccupied with
the girls. Some males even become depressed or anxious if they fail to find
the girls of their dreams for nights of unbridled romance.
For their own safety and the safety of cagemates, you should house unaltered
males separately during mating season if you’re not using them for breeding.
But I suggest that you do them and yourself a favor and neuter.
Girls will be girls
Females, although less intent on finding the hobs of their dreams, enter a
period of heat if left unaltered. You can easily tell whether your ferret is in
heat because her vulva (genitals) swells a great deal from the increase in
hormones.
52
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

If you’re faced with a female fuzzy in heat, your vet may choose to administer
a hormone shot to bring her out of heat before spaying her. Or the vet may
breed her to a vasectomized male to fake her out of heat before spaying her.
Spaying your female while she’s in heat is possible, but it’s considered dan-
gerous due to the risk of hemorrhaging.
Swelling of the vulva can also be a sign of an incomplete or partial spay.
Altering ferrets at a very young age can result in this rare surgical error.
Unfortunately, a swollen vulva also is a common symptom of adrenal prob-
lems in a female ferret. Don’t overlook a swollen vulva. If you have a ferret
with this symptom, take a visit to an experienced ferret veterinarian; he’ll
yield the answers you need in order to proceed with the proper course of
action.
“You Want How Many Ferrets?”
Perhaps you’ve already thought about what type of ferret you want, what
gender you’d like, what kind of great cage you can make for your fuzzy, and
so on; one question you may not have thought about, though, is how many
ferrets to get, probably because you just assume that you’ll get one. One
ferret can be happy and content in a cage as long as she gets plenty of play-
time out of the cage every day. However, if you have a busy schedule and
your ferret won’t get out of the cage as often as she should, you may want to
consider getting two or three ferrets.
I advise all ferret owners to have at least two fuzzies. If you’re already caring
for one ferret, housing two ferrets won’t be that much different. In fact,
having three is about the same! Now that I think of it, three is probably a per-
fect ferret number (see the nearby sidebar for more). I used to think that one
could never have too many ferrets. Experience has led me to change my
mind. Groups of ferrets shouldn’t exceed what a normal litter size would be —
and the average litter size is five to eight kits. The bigger the group, the more
stress created. If you’d like to adopt more than eight ferrets, you should con-
sider breaking them up into groups.
Most altered ferrets will get along with other altered ferrets with little or no
problem (see the previous section for more on altering your ferret). Sure,
they’ll go through their share of aggressive squabbles and fighting for hierar-
chy, but they’ll eventually develop a bond. Even though ferrets have a deep-
rooted solitary instinct, they’ll come to view other ferrets as littermates and
play and bop around accordingly (see Figure 4-1). As usual, there are excep-
tions to the rule, so you’ll have to intervene when introductions and living
situations go sour (see Chapter 7 for more on dealing with ferret introduc-
tions and living situations).

Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)

Ferrets aren’t territorial to the extent that dogs are, but they are territorial
critters by nature. In the wild, polecats mark territories and chase off other
polecats of the same gender. In a cage, ferrets have little microterritories and
squabble over seemingly insignificant things. Although multiple ferrets usu-
ally share just about everything, from the water bottle to the litter box to the
sock stolen right off your foot, they do make claims to certain things (such as
a section on their beds).
Statistically speaking, it’s easiest to introduce one gender to the opposite
gender. (And all introductions should be made with altered ferrets, unless
you want to have many more.) There tends to be more acceptance if you go
this route. Introducing an altered boy to an altered boy also has a high suc-
cess rate. Surprisingly, a female ferret generally has the most difficulty
accepting another female ferret. Keep this in mind when considering adopt-
ing multiple ferrets. You can’t make any predictions, however.
If you already have one ferret and are considering adding another, do so with
some caution:
 Introduce new furballs in neutral territories with neutral toys, just
to be sure there are no bad feelings off the bat. See Chapter 7 on
introductions.
 An older ferret may not find the antics and energy of a kit or an adoles-
cent as amusing as you do. On the other hand, a younger ferret may be
just what the doctor ordered for the sometimes lazy and depressed
carpet shark, assuming no serious illness is going on.

Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

 It’s not unusual for the more dominant ferret to act a little bullyish and
make the first tackle. They may screech at each other with humped
backs and roll each other for a moment or two. Tails may get puffed like
pipe cleaners or bottle brushes. One may take all the toys and stockpile
them in a guarded corner or hidey-hole. These aren’t unusual acts asso-
ciated with introductions.
 Watch for the warning signs of true aggression, like ongoing screeching
and puffed tails. There should be little to no screeching, and tails should
return to normal size within 10 minutes of the initial meeting. If one or
both ferrets is doing more biting and screaming than playing after 5 or
10 minutes, call it a day and try again later.
It’s unusual to have one ferret kill another, but occasionally you’ll come
across an oddball that just simply hates other ferrets and makes an honest
effort to injure the other. These guys should remain single. One ferret draw-
ing blood or literally scaring the poop out of another ferret indicates a seri-
ous problem, and a mismatch has likely occurred.
A solitary ferret is a ferret that has reverted back to normal adult polecat
behavior in terms of accepting other ferrets. In other words, she wants to live
alone! Face it, ferrets are individuals, and a small percentage just won’t toler-
ate being with other ferrets. If you have such a fuzzy, you’ll have to keep her
separate from the others.
The bottom line is this: One ferret is amusing; two or more ferrets are a
stitch. In and out of the cage, multiple ferrets wrestle and tumble together.
They chatter and screech and fuss about. They steal each other’s treasures
and then collapse together in a cuddly pile until one decides to start the rou-
tine over again. If you’re even questioning how many fuzzies to bring home,
get at least two!
55
Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)
Three’s a good company
I’ve heard many tales of a ferret becoming
severely depressed when her long-term cage-
mate died. The best thing to do for a grieving
ferret, in my opinion, is to get her another ferret
as soon as possible. This is where adopting
three ferrets comes in handy. Having three
means the loss of one ferret won’t leave another
ferret completely alone, and you’ll have time to
bring another ferret into your life and the lives
of the surviving ferrets at your own pace. But
that’s just my opinion, and some people think I’m
nuts! Ferret lovers often wonder how they
started with three ferrets and quickly end up
with seven or more. That, my friends, is called
ferret math. It’s what ferret lovers blame for the
mysterious additions and multiplications of fer-
rets. It just happens!

Where to Find Your Ferret
You can adopt or purchase a ferret from many places and from many people.
Where you go depends on your priorities, what you’re looking for, and how
far you’re willing to go to get your ferret (to the ends of the earth, no doubt!).
Pet shops and breeders are the places to go for kits, though shelters and pri-
vate individuals may have them at times. Shelters and private individuals will
have your adults, but pet shops and breeders may often have adults up for
sale on occasion as well. To minimize the pains of introductions and quaranti-
ning, if you opt for bringing home more than one ferret, consider getting
them from the same source. Almost all the sources I mention will offer multi-
ples for sale or adoption. The following sections present the many different
locales where little fuzzies are waiting for you as you read.
No matter where they come from, most ferrets are very adaptable to new
people and new environments. If you’re generous with your time, patience,
love, and ferret-friendly treats, you’ll have a friend for life.
Perusing pet shops
Perhaps the most commonly thought of source for buying a ferret is the local
pet shop. The goal of a pet shop is to sell to customers, not to make your life
with a ferret harmonious, so you need to do your homework on the ferret and
research your local pet shop before buying a new carpet shark. The following
list presents some things to think about if you plan to get your ferret from a
pet shop:
 Pet shops are convenient, but your choice can be limited, because they
usually only have a few commercially bred kits (baby ferrets) at any
given time.
56
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 
More than just the cold shoulder
Here’s some advice from Animal Behaviorist Dr.
Valerie Staton: “Sometimes it’s the new ferret
that is being aggressive, not the current resi-
dents. When this happens you are likely dealing
with fear aggression, not territorial or domi-
nance aggression. Make sure that the new
ferret feels safe in her surroundings and has
scouted out a safe hiding place before making
the introduction. Also, try not to start an intro-
duction when the ferrets are wound up and
excited. Sleepy ferrets are less likely to make
sudden moves that might startle a nervous
newcomer.”

 The majority of the kits come from mass producers (ferret farms).
Occasionally, a pet shop will buy kits from a local breeder. You may even
find an older fuzzy that wasn’t bought as a kit or whose previous owner
returned her.
Ferrets that originate from mass ferret producers tend to be a little
smaller. Many private breeders put out larger and bulkier fuzzbutts. If
size is important to you, you need to know where your potential young-
sters came from.
 You may or may not get a health guarantee with your purchase of a
ferret from a pet shop.
I suggest that you request a written health guarantee; if the pet shop
refuses, look elsewhere for your ferret. Reputable pet shops usually sell
healthy animals and therefore should be more than willing to offer writ-
ten health guarantees.
 Pet shops may be more expensive than many shelters. The expense may
be well worth it if your ferret is in top health and has a great personality
to match!
 In good pet shops, workers play with the kits frequently to ensure
proper socialization, and members of the staff have been trained exten-
sively in the care of the animals they sell.
In bad pet shops, staff members leave kits in their cages until potential
buyers ask to see them. This practice can lead to poor socialization at a
critical point in the ferrets’ lives. In these bad pet shops, employees may
be unknowledgeable in the care of specific animals, which causes them
to recite misinformation to unknowing customers, and the shops won’t
offer solid after-sale support.
You need to find out whether the pet shop you’re considering is one of the
good ones; keep the following bits of advice in mind:
 Don’t purchase a ferret on your first visit. Make several visits to see how
the staff truly cares for the animals.
 Pet shops should be clean and tidy, as should the animal cages that
house the potential pets. The animals should look and act healthy and
have clean food and water.
 Employees should be knowledgeable about the animals customers
inquire about, or they should be willing to seek out the correct answers
to questions. They should be sensitive to your concerns regarding fer-
rets without displaying the “sell sell sell” attitude.
I suggest that you see if the pet shop has printed educational materials
about ferrets — for example, the pros and cons of having one, the guide-
lines to determining if a ferret is suitable for you, and information on
general care. You can get and look over this information ahead of time to
test the employees’ level of knowledge about the pets they sell.
57
Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)

 Try to find people who have purchased animals from your local shop
and get their opinions. You also can check with the Better Business
Bureau for prior complaints about the shop or call your local Humane
Society to ask about the shop.
Picking out private breeders
A logical and common place to find a ferret for adoption is a private breeder —
a private breeder can be an individual with a single breeding pair of ferrets or
a fancy ferretry with up to a dozen breeding pairs. The biggest typically don’t
produce more than a dozen or so litters a year. Like pet shops, you can find
good breeders and bad breeders. Locating a reputable breeder can be diffi-
cult because few private ferret breeders are out there. You can expect to pay
two to three times more for a private-breeder ferret than a pet-store ferret.
A good source for finding ferret breeders is a small-pet magazine — 
particularly a ferret-specific magazine, such as Ferrets magazine (www.
ferretsmagazine.com). This wonderful magazine not only offers readers
up-to-date ferret information on a bimonthly basis, but also advertises 
breeders and provides other ferret-related resources. You also can use word
of mouth in the ferret community; other people may be able to point you
toward respected breeders. Additionally, the Internet provides a wealth of
information on ferret breeders and their ferretries. This latter option is a
great starting place in your search for a private breeder.
People breed ferrets for several reasons, and you must keep them in mind
when trying to find a breeder. Some breed for money and profit; others breed
because they love fuzzies; and for some, it’s a combination of both. A good
breeder will be very honest and up front with you about the responsibility of
having a ferret as a pet.
Although a good breeder should be pleasant and easy to talk with, you may
end up feeling like you’re the one being quizzed. This can be a very good
thing. A breeder who’s too eager to part with kits may be raising ferrets only
for the profit and not for the well being of the ferrets or the buyers.
Here are some more ways you can find out whether a breeder is reputable
and a ferret lover:
 Try to get references from people who’ve bought kits from the breeder.
 If geographically feasible, travel to see the breeder’s facility to get a
sense of how the ferrets are kept.
 Ask the breeder about his motivation for breeding ferrets. A good
breeder may say that he’s breeding ferrets to improve the species.
58
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

 Ask the breeder about vaccination and vet schedules and any illnesses
he has encountered with the ferret. Make sure, if you purchase a kit, that
you get a written health guarantee from the breeder. An adoption (or
purchase) contract should be available for you to see ahead of time.
 A good breeder will offer after-sales support. Ask if the breeder is willing
to chat with you when you call with a question regarding your newly
purchased baby.
 Ask about what happens if the ferret doesn’t work out for you. Will the
breeder take the ferret back? A responsible breeder will do this.
Note: A good breeder may have only one or two pairs of breeding ferrets, or
he may have many more. Although you certainly don’t want inbred ferrets,
the amount of breeding pairs doesn’t tell you if he does or doesn’t practice
good breeding.
A good look at the animals in stock will tell you more about the breeding
practices of a private breeder than anything else. A good breeder, regardless
of the number of ferrets he has, will have humane conditions, active and alert
ferrets, and intensely curious kits.
When you find a good, honest, reputable breeder, you may have to wait for
the next litter to arrive. Some breeders will allow you to special-order certain
coat colors or patterns.
Adopting from a ferret shelter
Perhaps the most overlooked location for adopting a wonderful pet ferret is a
ferret shelter. At a shelter, you can find ferrets of all colors, patterns, and per-
sonalities. Some are youngsters that proved too energetic for their unedu-
cated owners. Others are past their life expectancies and need gentle and
59
Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)
My, what big ferrets you have!
Private breeders often produce bigger ferrets
than commercial ferret breeders or pet shops,
usually because private breeders don’t neuter/
spay their babies early. Hormones play a role in
growth . . . well, let me clarify this a bit. Early
neutering causes males to be smaller due to
lack of estrogen. However, this same lack of
estrogen due to early neutering actually causes
females to be larger. Most commercially bred
ferret babies are altered at 6 weeks after birth.
Ferrets from private breeders usually are
altered at the new owners’ expense and dis-
cretion. A reputable breeder will discuss your
options with you.

loving homes for their final months. Some have been abused and/or
neglected and require experienced, patient ferret homes. Others have been
well cared for until their surrender. Many shelter fuzzies have special needs,
such as daily medications or special feedings.
If these things sound good to you, a shelter may be the perfect place for you
to look. The number of ferrets that wind up in shelters is overwhelming. No
matter what type of ferret you’re looking for, a shelter is bound to have her.
Adopting a ferret from a shelter is a great way to support the ferret cause.
Want an extra perk? An adoption may mean a membership to the shelter’s
ferret club (if it has one). Membership could include newsletters, ferret
shows, holiday parties, and fundraisers. So, along with adding a wonderful
new family member, you get the chance to meet other furball fanatics and
make a connection to a lifelong support group.
If you’re considering getting your ferret from a shelter, heed the following
information:
 Shelters rely on ferret adoptions for financial assistance and to make
room for incoming fuzzies. Many shelters have no less than 60 ferrets at
any given time. Adoption fees at shelters usually are lower; they vary
depending on the age and health of the ferret being adopted.
 Most people work in the business of ferret rescuing and sheltering only
because of their undying devotion to ferrets, so you don’t have to worry
about greedy or negative motives.
 Expect shelter operators to conduct friendly yet thorough interviews
with potential adopters. That’s good and necessary in the shelter busi-
ness. The job of the shelter folks is to put their ferrets into lifelong, loving
homes. They want to find the best families for these homeless fuzzies.
 Many shelters may have certain restrictions or requirements that breed-
ers and pet shops may not have. For instance, almost all shelters require
that the owners return the ferrets to the shelters if the relationships
don’t work out. Some have age restrictions on young children. Others
want proof from landlords that ferrets are allowed. And still others
require the entire family to be present for the adoption process. Every
shelter has its own process.
 Most ferret shelters have veterinarians who work closely with them to
monitor the health of the ferrets in their care. Some shelters have blood
work performed on older fuzzies just for peace of mind.
A ferret you’re considering adopting from a shelter should already be
vaccinated before you bring her home, and a general physical has to
have ruled out most illnesses.
 Most ferret shelter staff members are eager to extend after-adoption
support — when they aren’t up to their elbows in work! After your adop-
tion, you’re bound to make friends with the shelter workers, which
means a lifetime of support and continuing knowledge.

Are you starting to look for that perfect shelter ferret but don’t know where
to go? Start surfing the Web to research nearby ferret shelters. Here are a
couple great places to start:
www.ferretcentral.org
www.supportourshelters.org/SOS-ShelterList.html
Both sites keep up-to-date lists of ferret shelters around the world.
Checking the classified ads
The newspaper classified ads or the bulletin boards at veterinary clinics or
pet shops are more wonderful sources for ferrets in need of homes. If you live
in a larger city (one where owning a ferret is legal; see Chapter 3), it isn’t
uncommon to come across posted signs or ads for ferrets that need new
homes. Sometimes, the sellers will be willing to part with cages and supplies
as part of their fees.
Most often, the ferrets being sold through ads are older. The good news is
that a previous owner can provide a wealth of background information on a
particular ferret, which you may not be able to get when adopting through
other avenues. If you’re hoping to adopt from a private individual who can
provide as much background information as possible on your new ferret,
adopting through an ad may be for you.
In these situations, you’re most likely not going to get the niceties such as
pre-purchase vet visits or health guarantees. The ferret(s) will come “as is,”
and “as is” frequently comes with the cage and all supplies. The adoption fee
usually is worth that alone. The ferrets themselves should be outwardly
healthy and have good temperaments.
Buyer beware: Like a pet shop, a private seller’s ultimate goal may be getting
rid of the ferret and getting cash in hand as soon as possible. Many sellers,
though, are kind animal lovers who just want their fuzzies to go to more
appropriate homes and want to recuperate some of their initial investments.
Rescuing the wayward weasel: 
Stray ferrets
Unfortunately, some people will find stray ferrets that are lost or have been
abandoned by their previous caretakers. Always be cautious with a found
ferret because you don’t know what she’s been through. She’s likely scared
and hungry and probably is very confused. She doesn’t know if your inten-
tions are good or bad, and she may bite out of fear or defense.
61
Chapter 4: On the Tail of a New Carpet Shark (Um, Ferret)

Ferrets are susceptible to rabies, so take this into consideration and take
proper precautions if you find a stray ferret. The first thing you should do is
protect yourself from being bitten and take the ferret to the vet for a com-
plete checkup. Remember that the ferret doesn’t need to have bite wounds
for it to have been exposed to the virus. Next, follow the proper quarantine
procedures for a minimum of two weeks, housing the ferret in her own cage
several rooms away from your other ferrets, feeding and cleaning her last,
and wearing a different shirt over your clothes while handling that ferret.
Handle the ferret very cautiously, because if you’re bitten, she’ll need to be
quarantined at the vet for a minimum of ten days, as required by most states
for your own safety. Some states still require that the ferret be euthanized
and be tested for rabies because her vaccination status is unknown.
If you find a lost ferret, you should make every attempt to find her home
because someone may be grieving the loss of this little furball. Place an ad in
your local paper and post notes on bulletin boards at pet shops, veterinary
clinics, and other high-traffic areas. Many large newspapers allow you to
place lost-and-found ads free of charge for up to one week. Be sure to leave
out some specific identifying information in the ad so that the real owner can
prove his or her ownership.
Nowadays, microchipping domestic pets has become common procedure. A
microchip can help you rescue a lost animal by tying the unique chip number
to the owner. If you find a stray ferret, take the animal to your local veterinar-
ian to have her scanned for a chip.
If the weeks go by and you don’t find her home, you may decide that you
want to keep her. Be sure to quarantine her before introducing her to your
other fuzzies. She may be sick or have fleas. A trip to the vet with your newly
found friend is a must. If you don’t find her home and you can’t keep her,
don’t abandon the little fuzzy. You can contact many excellent ferret shelters
that would be more than happy to find your friend a proper home. You can
also place an ad for the many ferret fanatics out there who may reply quickly
to the chance to adopt a new pet.
The majority of dog/cat shelters accept ferrets, but many kill the ferrets
instead of going to the trouble of finding them good homes. Don’t take a
found ferret to your local animal shelter, no matter how good its intentions
may seem. Contact a good ferret shelter that will take her in and find a good
home for her, or take her into your own home.
Some people mistakenly identify minks and long-tailed weasels as ferrets. I’ve
gone out on more than my fair share of stray ferret calls where I’ve come
home with minks. Although these wild animals are awfully cute, minks can
pack a powerful bite and shouldn’t be approached. Be sure the critter you’re
“rescuing” is indeed a ferret!

from the house and furniture to the bathroom accessories and wardrobe. If
you already have a ferret and all the necessary accommodations, please read
this chapter anyway to make sure you haven’t forgotten something. With so

Setting Up Fuzzy’s Cage
Preparing the cage is where true fuzzball lovers often show their fanatical yet
creative sides. Cages range from simple, single-level ranches to multilevel
mansions with guesthouses. The cage you choose depends on your taste and
what you can afford, both financially and spatially. The effort in choosing is
worth it, though. After all, your ferret has to stay in his house when he’s not
out playing, so you should work on creating as stimulating an environment as
possible. The following sections cover the necessary cage considerations,
from size to location.

Ferrets are carnivores. You should house ferrets only with other ferrets or by
themselves. Although most pet ferrets don’t recognize small animals as food,
they may play small animals and birds to death. Many ferrets, though, have a
strong predatory urge. I’ve known people who’ve lost rats, mice, sugar glid-
ers, birds, and guinea pigs to pet ferrets. If you insist on interaction between
your ferret and other animals, supervise them closely and cautiously.
Size matters: Picking the proper cage
The cage for one or two ferrets should be at least 3 feet wide x 2 feet deep x 
2 feet high. This size is the absolute minimum. For households with more fer-
rets, I suggest going to multilevel cages (see Figure 5-1). As with most pets,
the bigger the cage, the better. Whatever size you choose, be sure your
fuzzy’s cage has enough space for a playroom, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom,
and, of course, your baby. You wouldn’t want to eat, sleep, and play in your
toilet, and neither would your ferret.
Fuzzy blueprints: Making sure
the design is right
Many, many types of pet cages are more than adequate for your ferret. Due to
the complexity of the ferret’s housing needs, though, ferret owners really
should consider bringing in the custom ferret cage. This can be a cage special
made by professionals or built with your own bare hands if you have the skills
and talent. I recommend two things, however. First, make sure the doors are
big enough so that you can put a larger litter box or even a nest box in the
cage. And, if you do include larger doors, make sure you attach extra door
latches to prevent gaps and escapes. (For more on nest boxes, see the side-
bar “Bob Church’s simple steps to saving fuzzy’s sanity” later in this chapter.)
Pick up a ferret magazine and see how creative ferret humans can be with
cage designs. Construct a cage on your own, or with professionals, that fits
all your ferret’s needs. I present the keys to a good cage in the following list,
and I go into greater detail in the sections that follow:
 Ample size: The floor space should be roomy to allow for ample playing
and comfortable snoozing.
 Good ventilation: Poor ventilation combined with stinky, damp patches
of urine and stool can lead to illness and disease.
Avoid aquariums and similar enclosures for housing your ferret. These
habitats lack proper ventilation and can cause serious illness. Besides
being too small and cramped for an active carpet shark, they’re made
for fish, not ferrets!
64
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

 Small openings between wire and secure doors: Ferrets are master
escape artists. They’ll try to stick their heads into or through any open-
ing they can get their snouts into. They can and will push open doors
with their heads.
Severe injury or even strangulation can occur in an unsuitable cage.
Make sure that your cage design features no large openings and that, if
necessary, snap bolts reinforce the doors on the cage (snap bolts are the
snaps at the end of a dog leash; see Figure 5-1).
 Sturdiness and easy access for cleaning: Certain ferret cages come with
pull-out trays to catch the litter and food crumbs that fall to the bottom.
If you’re lucky, you’ll find or build a cage that has a built-in metal litter
box that pulls out.
I found a company called Corner Creek Acres, which is located in Ottumwa,
Iowa. The folks there build beautiful, spacious cages for incredibly reason-
able prices. They ship, too. The company offers many designs but will
custom-build any cage to your specifications. These cages are among the
best cages I’ve come across for small critters such as ferrets. You can contact
the company by calling 641-684-7122.

Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters

Materials
Perhaps the best types of ferret cages are made of sturdy galvanized wire. I
prefer the black vinyl-coated wire because it’s not only decorative but also
easier on your ferret’s feet. If the cage’s floor is made of wire, be sure the little
squares are no bigger than 1⁄4 inch x 1⁄4 inch. Ferrets have little feet, and spaced
wire can be hard on their sensitive pads. And you certainly don’t want any-
thing wide enough for your ferret’s feet to fall through.
A company I love is Kritter Koncepts in Cambridge, WI. It makes custom
black vinyl-coated wire cages that are both attractive and affordable. You
can reach Kritter Koncepts at 608-423-3124, or you can view its Web site at
www.kritterkoncepts.net.
You should consider covering a wire-bottom cage with as much soft material
as possible to prevent sore or injured feet. Here are some options you can
consider:
 You can cut a piece of carpeting and fit it into the bottom of the cage. If
you use carpeting, you must take it out and wash it thoroughly or
replace it as necessary. Dirty bedding usually accounts for most ferret
odor, so your nose will tell you when the time has come!
You need to supervise ferrets with carpeted cages. They love to dig at
the fibers, and some ferrets find the fibers simply delicious, which can
be dangerous. Also, be aware that your ferret can snag its claws on
carpet fibers and other fabrics, which may cause him to become trapped
or injured. Keeping his nails trimmed will help (see Chapter 9), but it
won’t necessarily prevent this problem.
 You can use a fitted piece of linoleum flooring or Plexiglas to cover the
floor. I like the linoleum because it’s flexible and the easiest surface to
clean.
Cages made of wood are impossible to completely sanitize, because the ma-
terial is porous and easily absorbs urine. Your ferret may chew and ingest the
wood, or damage to the teeth may occur. And certain treated woods can con-
tain harmful chemicals. Three strikes, you’re out! Likewise, certain metal sur-
faces may contain lead and zinc (which is just as toxic as lead; most cages no
longer have lead, but the galvanizing process may still include zinc); when
ingested, these materials can be harmful to your ferret. Do your cage
research before you dish out the money to save yourself a pile of trouble
in the end.
One story or multilevel?
Although a single-level cage will do the job, it just doesn’t seem appropriate
for the captive lifestyle of a ferret (see the chapters in Part I for basics on the
ferret lifestyle and Part V for more on ferret psychology). Ferrets are active
66
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

and inquisitive. And as ground dwellers, they love to burrow under piles of
stuff. But they also enjoy racing up and down the ramps in a multilevel cage
like the one in Figure 5-2. Multilevels also add more opportunity for you to
attach cage accessories that are almost as important as the cage itself (see
the later section “Acquiring Accessories and Other Stuff Fuzzy Needs”).
Here are some factors to consider when creating/purchasing a multilevel cage:
 The ramps in a multilevel should be made of wire because solid ramps
act more like slides than ladders.
 Multilevel cages should have multiple doors to access the different
levels.
 You should consider adding a litter box to the upper level.
 At some point during the routine cleaning process, you’ll have to reach
into the far corners of all levels of the cage, so be sure you can access
them.
 You should provide snap bolts at the doorway gaps for extra security.
Leave the single level cages for the hospital cages or for those ferrets that
may be injured or too old to navigate ramps safely.

A home within a home: Finding
a place inside for the cage
Placement of his cage is vital to the health and happiness of your ferret. If
you can, place the cage where he can see you several times a day. It should
be a quiet, comfortable place, conducive to snoozing when necessary, but it
shouldn’t be so far out of the way that the fuzzy’s forgotten in your daily rou-
tine. Some ferret lovers actually dedicate entire rooms to ferrets and their
cages. When I kept my ferrets in my home, my cages were connected by col-
orful tubes. I never knew which ferret would be sleeping in which cage!
Sometimes, as many as eight were piled snuggly onto one hammock, although
I had four to five hammocks throughout my maze of cages.
Here are some other pointers and reminders on indoor cage placement:
 Extreme blowing air can cause your ferret to get sick. Drafts, or air
movement itself, don’t make people or animals sick. Cold air blowing
continuously on the cage isn’t good; however, cool air is fine. Also, hot
air blowing continuously on the cage isn’t good. Extremes are the prob-
lem, not the air movement itself.
Putting a cage near an outflow vent of an air conditioner or furnace is
bad because of the dust and debris that may be blown out during the
first few seconds. This can cause respiratory irritation or infection. It
may also cause eye irritations.
 High humidity without good ventilation will cause distress. Basements
and small, poorly ventilated rooms often are damp and great breeding
grounds for bacteria. If you must house your ferrets in a high-moisture
area, use a dehumidifier.
 Too much light will interfere with sleep cycles. It’s important to have a
cage site that can be darkened at night. Erratic photoperiods and long
light cycles can be a health problem for ferrets, so they need to be able
to have about 10 to 12 hours of complete darkness. (See Chapter 16 for
info on adrenal gland disease.) Another option is some sort of light-
eliminating covering over the cage for part of the day.
 Loud noise will stress your ferret and interfere with the sleep cycle.
Avoid placing the cage next to televisions or stereo speakers. The loud
noise is very disturbing and if used at night can interfere with the
normal sleep cycle.
 Place the cage on tile if at all possible, and pull the cage at least 6
inches from the wall. A ferret’s toilet habits can get sloppy, and you’ll
most definitely be cleaning both the floor and wall surrounding the cage
routinely. You may want to consider putting up a large piece of acrylic
glass to cover the wall closest to the cage. If you absolutely must put the
cage on carpeting, invest in more acrylic glass or place a large piece of
linoleum under the cage. Ferrets love to scoot up into the corners of
their cages and poop out the sides!

A room with a view: Finding 
a place outside for the cage
As more and more people recognize the importance of natural lighting for fer-
rets, ferrets have been moving outside to experience Mother Nature first
hand. Housing your ferret outside is a complicated issue that needs a great
deal of consideration on your part, in addition to extreme diligence to health
and safety. Not only does your cage have to be completely escape-proof and
at least partially covered, but your ferrets also need heartworm protection.
And cage placement is one of the most critical aspects of keeping ferrets suc-
cessfully outside.
I keep my ferrets outside, and they come in for personal playtime. They
thrive outdoors, but I pay close attention to their needs, checking on them
two or more times a day. I also have more than one ferret, so they can cuddle
when it’s cool out. Outdoor housing isn’t for the lazy or the scatter-brained
caretaker. Here are some tips on outdoor cage placement:
69
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters
Heading off cage stress
Cage stress is often associated with a ferret’s
inability to escape to a safe place. You can iden-
tify a ferret suffering from cage stress by watch-
ing his behavior. Some signs may include the
following:
 Constant pacing back and forth
 Gnawing on the cage bars (which can ulti-
mately result in canine tooth fractures)
 Scratching incessantly at a corner of the
cage
 Sores on his head and face from trying to
push his way out of his confines
 Destruction in the cage, including the tip-
ping of bowls and litter boxes, more so than
“normal”
It’s imperative that your fuzzy have somewhere
dark and warm to hide and get away from all
that’s going on around him. You can use piles of
fluffy bedding or a snooze sack, for example.
Providing safety and security helps prevent
cage stress. If you have a particularly nervous
ferret (see Part V of this book for more on ferret
psychology), you can cover part of his cage with
a sheet or large towel.
Wooden parrot nest boxes can make great
hidey-holes and sleeping spots for ferrets. In
addition, a nest box can make for a fun climbing
experience. Insert a few cuddly pieces of bed-
ding into the box, and place the box into the
cage or your ferret’s play area. Watch for wood
chewing. If you notice a lot of wear and tear,
replace the box or scrap the idea altogether.
Also, wood is porous and difficult to clean.
Ferrets generally don’t poop or pee where they
sleep, but the young, sick, or disabled may be
the exceptions to that rule. Check parrot nest
boxes frequently for soiling and throw them out
if they do become dirty. The urine will also even-
tually release ammonia, which is unhealthy for
a ferret to breath.

 Extreme cold and cold wind can kill. Below-freezing weather exposure
without a heated sleeping area, or exposure to freezing wind, can kill
your ferret. Placement of the cage in the sun during the winter months is
totally acceptable. You can cover one side of the cage for shade but
place the nest box in the sun. Additionally, you need more than bedding
to keep him warm. Nest boxes packed with straw will work. Avoid cloth,
because it can get moist and freeze. Cloth also is a poor insulator. Move
food, water, and litter boxes close to the nest box so that he’ll come out
to eat, drink, and go potty. Also, use a heated water bowl. You can pur-
chase one online so your ferret won’t snorkel during cold months. The
best protection, though, is considering housing him indoors during the
extreme winter months.
 More dangerous than the cold is the heat of the sun and high humid-
ity. Although ferrets enjoy the warmth that sunlight provides, direct sun-
light with no relief can be deadly. Ferrets can get heatstroke or heat
exhaustion if kept in hot places, even for just a short time. A temp of 80
degrees Fahrenheit or higher — especially with high humidity — is dan-
gerous for your ferret. Be sure you shade a large part of the cage at all
times so the fuzzy can escape the sun’s hot rays. Place your cage under
the comforting shade of trees if you have them. And be sure the nest box
is always in the shade. Also, consider adding a litter box filled with
water as a nice pool. Placement of cages on hot decks is ill-advised.
Again, you should consider moving your ferret indoors when the
weather becomes extreme.
 Fenced yards are optimal. Keeping your ferret’s cage shaded in a fenced
yard will keep predators such as foxes, coyotes, and dogs from getting
to your ferret. It will also keep your curious neighbors out, thus keeping
your ferret safe.
Some people think keeping ferrets outdoors is abusive. If done properly, it
can be very healthy for your ferrets. With the exception of talking briefly
about building an outdoor supervised play area for ferret enrichment (see
Chapter 10), this edition of Ferrets For Dummies doesn’t go into the specifics
of constructing permanent outdoor enclosures, due to the complexity of the
topic. However, I can recommend a phenomenal book that discusses this sub-
ject in great detail and length to anyone serious about outdoor housing. It’s
called Ferret Husbandry, Medicine and Surgery, 2nd Edition, by John H.
Lewington (Saunders/Elsevier Limited). Even if you keep your ferret outside
for only a few months a year, the book is well worth owning.
Of course, there are some places that you should just flat out avoid putting
your ferrets:
 Garages: These are full of danger. Besides being devoid of healthy nat-
ural lighting, many garages can get overly hot in the summer and lack
necessary ventilation. Most people keep chemicals in garages, including
gasoline, that give off harmful fumes. And cars coming in and going out
certainly add to the dangerous pollution.
70
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

 A deck: These heat up like a stove. Have you ever tried to walk barefoot
across a hot wooden deck in the summer? It’s like walking across hot
coals. A cage placed on a deck in the summer will roast in the hot sun,
even if it’s covered.
Making Your Ferret’s Bed
Ferrets absolutely love to tunnel and nestle in their bedding, so knowing
what and what not to use is important. Whether you cover the cage bottom is
up to you (see the earlier section “Materials”), but be sure to fill bedroom
areas with plenty of old T-shirts, sweatshirts, pillowcases, or towels. You
want to provide good snoozing sites and hiding places for your ferret. One
neat piece of bedding is simple to make: Simply snip off the legs of an old pair
of pants or blue jeans. You can also buy custom ferret snooze sacks and
fabric tunnels at any major pet supply store or online ferret supply store, but
if you’re handy with a sewing machine, you can easily make them. These
accessories are attractive and cozy.
You should wash all bedding regularly to aid in reducing odors. Keep a clean,
fresh supply of bedding on hand to use when you’re washing the dirty stuff.
Inspect your ferret’s bedding routinely. Some carpet sharks find cloth an irre-
sistible delicacy and chew holes in the fabric. These ferrets shouldn’t have
cloth. The danger comes from the ferret actually swallowing chunks of cloth.
You’ll find that certain ferrets need stronger types of fabric, such as denim, to
prevent “cloth grazing.” Small holes also pose a danger when your ferret is
playing or digging around to get comfortable. He’s apt to poke his head
through a hole, and if he twists and turns just right, he may find himself
trapped, and strangulation may occur. So toss the holey stuff. Finally, raggedy
fibers and materials like terry cloth can catch on long claws, so toss the
raggedy stuff and avoid fabrics like terry cloth.
Setting Your Ferret’s Table
Picking out your ferret’s food and water supplies doesn’t have to be as tedious
as picking out good china as a newlywed. However, not all food and water
dishes will live up to your ferret’s high standards, and he may put them
through a battery of destruction tests before you can finally settle on the best
feeding tools. Ferrets are extremely cunning little buggers. The average ferret
can master even the most ferret-proof dish — meaning almost all dishes can
be flung about the cage, tipped over, chewed up, pooped in, dug out, or slept
in. You need to find the best possible dish and attempt to outsmart your ferret
by adding a few clever accessories to keep the food and water clean and in
their dishes. Remember, it’s all in the presentation! The following sections
show you the way.

Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 
Bob Church’s simple steps 
to saving fuzzy’s sanity
Besides enrichment (see Chapter 10), a ferret’s
need for security is perhaps his most over-
looked necessity. People think of ferrets as gre-
garious creatures that need little alone time.
The fact is, however, a ferret needs a place to
call his own — a place to defend, if necessary,
against the onslaught of other ferrets. A lack of
privacy and self-protection is a leading cause
of stress in ferrets. A nest box, which makes for
a great bed and climbing area, is the perfect
solution to this problem.
You can build a nest box for your fuzzy on your
own. And if you think building a nest box would
be too expensive and time consuming, ferret
friend and enthusiast Bob Church makes it too
easy for you to refuse! It should cost you only
five or six dollars per nest box.
Pick out the following tools:
 Black marker
 Hobby knife with a #11 blade
And purchase the following materials:
 One Rubbermaid Duratote storage box —
four gallon size (about $4.00)
 One PVC flush downspout — 2 x 3 x 4 inch
size (about $1.50)
Rubbermaid and generic totes are inexpensive,
and you can find them in most department and
hardware stores. They’re easy to clean and dis-
infect, are durable, and provide the darkness
necessary to make an adequate nest box.
Remember! A ferret needs complete darkness!
These totes are strong but can be easily cut.
They’re attractive and functional both inside
and outside of the cage, but you must properly
measure if you plan to use the tote inside the
cage. The PVC fittings are smooth and rounded,
ensuring that your ferret doesn’t rub himself and
get chaffed. Males can’t hook themselves on
edges, and the PVC is easy to clean.
But it may be challenging to find the PVC fitting,
which is probably mysteriously hidden some-
where in your local hardware or home-improve-
ment store. Just tell an employee, as if you
know what you’re talking about, that you’re
looking for “a PVC 2" x 3" x 4" flush downspout
that’s the adapter fitting that attaches a 4” round
pipe to a 2" x 3" rectangular downspout.” The
opening of the fitting should be just large
enough for the biggest ferret to squeeze
through but small enough for a little one to
defend. The worker should happily lead you
through a maze of unidentifiable stuff to this
perplexing fitting. Memorize this spot and hope
that the store doesn’t rearrange before the next
time you come looking to build a nest box.
Rubbermaid probably didn’t know it at the time,
but it designed its tote to be a nest box for fer-
rets! The recessed panel on the narrow side of
the tote is a perfect location for the PVC fitting.
Just follow these steps to create your fuzzy’s
nest box, and refer to the figure as needed to
see how you’re doing:
1. Place the rectangular part of the fitting
flush onto the storage box, and trace
around the outer edge with your black
marker.
You can put the fitting high or low, but
putting it higher up makes it easier for your
ferret to defend. On the other hand, if your
ferret has hind-end weakness or is older,
you may want to put the fitting on the
lower end.

73
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters
2. Because you want the PVC fitting to fit
tightly into the tote, don’t cut along the line
you just traced; instead, carefully cut just
inside the line (figure a).
Round the corners instead of making them
90-degree angles to keep the plastic from
tearing when you actually insert the PVC fit-
ting. You’re almost there! You should now
have a gaping hole in the narrow side of the
tote box. You put the fitting in this hole, but
first you must make the plastic a little more
supple so that you can easily insert the
fitting.
3. Fill your tub or sink with hot water, and
immerse the cut end of the tote into the
water.
Let the plastic soak for a few minutes. The
heat of the water will soften the plastic, but
not for long, so you have to act fast and
carefully.
4. While the plastic is still soft, push the rec-
tangular part of the fitting through the hole
(figure b).
The fit will be tight, so you’ll need to give the
fitting a firm push. The plastic will slowly
give way and reform around the fitting to
create a secure connection. When the fit-
ting is in place, your hard work is done. Just
add some soft, warm bedding (figure d), pop
on the storage box’s lid, and let your ferret
(figure c) do the rest!

Serving your ferret’s food
with a sturdy dish
Pet dishes come in just about every size, shape, color, and texture. Their
makers guarantee amazing things, such as non-tippable, indestructible, and
easy to clean. And for the average pet, these claims are true. But a ferret sees
a challenge in all that surrounds him, and a simple food dish is no exception.
You need to choose the dish that best suits your ferret’s needs. Remembering
a few things may make your purchase easier and more successful. In the fol-
lowing sections, I prepare you for the food challenge that lies ahead and give
you some bowl options.
Stay away from food dish materials such as flimsy plastic and unglazed pot-
tery or ceramic. Stick with stainless steel, thick plastic, or heavily glazed
ceramic.
Fuzzy feeding challenges
Your ferret is bound to find the one weakness of the bowl you purchase for
him. Bowls are gnawed on, tipped, and tossed. They’re buried in bedding and
even in litter boxes. Almost any bowl, attached or detached, is subject to
becoming a sleeping area. Unless you buy an itty-bitty bowl or have a ferret
the size of a housecat, you’ll just have to be amused with this enchanting trait.
Less amusing is how many ferrets love to dig their food out of their bowls.
This is another trait you must learn to live with. If your ferret cage has multi-
ple levels (see the earlier section “Setting Up Fuzzy’s Cage”), you can place
the food dish anywhere on the top level or put it away from the corners on
the lower levels (ferrets like to poop in corners). You should discard contami-
nated food immediately. Likewise, a poopy food dish is an unsanitary food
dish; wash it right away.
Attachable bowls
You can fasten small metal C-clamps from a hardware store around the bowl,
hanger, and side of the cage to prevent dish tragedy (see Figure 5-3).
Although attachable bowls don’t prevent digging, they do work to prevent
tipping and catapulting. You can also drill a couple of holes in a sturdy plastic
dish and fasten it to the sides of the cage with cable ties or even thin wire.
Another option is a wire dish hanger that simply hangs over the wire of the
cage. If you choose this option, grab your pliers and bend the holder until it
can’t be lifted off the wire. Oftentimes, this type of holder falls prey to the
“flip and tip” method of kill. With only the top fastened to the cage, the ferret
can lift the bottom and fling the food out of the cage. A simple garbage tie or
piece of wire can secure the bottom of the hanger to the cage, too.
74
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Even attachable bowls have flaws. Not all are ferret-proof as far as becoming
detached. The round stainless-steel bowls that fit snugly into an attached
round wire hanger are great until the fit becomes just a tad loose. Being the
predator he is, your ferret will sense the minute weakness of the dish. With a
push and a shove of his back feet, a ferret lying on his back can easily flip the
dish right out of its holder and into a soiled litter box. Quality ferret food cer-
tainly isn’t cheap, so choose carefully the manner in which you present it to
your ferret.
Weighted bowls
Unless your ferret is Hercules (and he may very well be), a heavily weighted
dish or one made of a heavy material (such as thick ceramic) helps minimize
the distance he can catapult the dish across his cage. If you can’t fasten your
ferret’s bowl to the side of his cage, get the heaviest bowl possible — 
preferably one that’s wider at the base to make it more difficult to tip over.
Always place heavy ceramic bowls on the lowest level of the cage. On higher
levels, these bowls can be quite dangerous if they’re pushed off and tumble
onto a fuzzy below.

clamp to

75
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters

Plastic bowls
If you’re determined to buy a plastic food dish, make sure you purchase the
heavy-duty type. The less porous the composition of the bowl, the more sani-
tary and easier to clean it is. Avoid lightweight plastic. It’s easily damaged,
and as a result of constant scratching and gnawing, small grooves and holes,
which can be difficult to see, accumulate and harbor harmful bacteria.
To fully sanitize a plastic dish, you need to dip it into boiling water for about
5 minutes. You can also sanitize the bowl with a 30:1 water to bleach solution
and let it soak for 20 minutes. Remember to wash it and rinse it well after
soaking.
Hydrating your ferret with a water bottle
Up until now, I’ve said little about water dishes, and I have a simple explana-
tion as to why: Most ferret owners don’t put their ferrets’ drinking water into
bowls. Ferrets love to play in water, and they view water dishes as mini-pools.
The water bottle is perhaps one of the greatest and least appreciated inven-
tions made available to pet owners. You can easily clean it, it doesn’t tip
over, and it provides uncontaminated water throughout the day. The last
point is very important, because providing a constant supply of clean, fresh
water is essential to your ferret’s well being. Note: Water bottles work best
when you fill them at least halfway, so keep this in mind when feeding and
watering.
Bottle sizes vary, from those suitable for a mouse to those large enough for
dogs and cats. A bottle that’s too small yields little water and empties
quickly. One that’s too large, such as those designed for dogs, can be difficult
for a ferret to operate because it requires a much harder push. Fortunately,
bottle makers have taken some of the thought out of the process by making
several specifically for ferrets. If you can’t find a bottle at a pet supply shop, a
guinea pig or rabbit water bottle is appropriate.
Picking out a bottle is just the first step. You also must attach the bottle to
fuzzy’s cage and train him to use it. Find out how in the sections that follow.
An older or weaker ferret, or even a ferret with bad or sensitive teeth, may
find it very difficult to drink from a water bottle. He would prefer to become
dehydrated rather than take an uncomfortable or painful drink. Ferrets like
this are exceptions to the rule; provide them with water bowls rather than
water bottles.
76
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Attaching the bottle to the cage
Ferret water bottles are designed to mount on the outside of the cage (see
Figure 5-4). Bottles hung on the inside of the cage are fair game; most ferrets
will quickly seize and dismantle them. Also, outside mounting is convenient
for you, because you have easy access to the bottle, which you should
change daily.
As with anything your ferret sees, if his water bottle isn’t firmly attached,
you’ll find it on the floor the next time you check his cage. And you’ll have
him staring pitifully out at you with his “What took you so long to get here?”
look.
A water bottle doesn’t work too well if your fuzzy can’t reach it. I’ve seen
many people place their pets’ water bottles way too high or way too low
without even thinking about it. Position the bottle at a comfortable height so
that your ferret doesn’t have to strain himself by reaching too high or crouch-
ing too low to snatch a drink. Also, keep in mind the number of ferrets resid-
ing in the cage. If you have three or more in one cage, consider adding
another bottle. For multilevel cages, providing water bottles on the top and
bottom levels is a good idea.
Figure 5-4:
Water
bottles

77
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters

Training fuzzy to use his water bottle
When training a newcomer to use the water bottle, place a shallow dish of
water just beneath the bottle until the water bottle level indicates that the
ferret is using it. Taking away his water bowl prematurely can lead to dehy-
dration. Also, you should separate a ferret that’s still learning to use a water
bottle until you know that he’s drinking from it. It won’t do him any good if
other ferrets are drinking from the bottle and you assume he is, too.
Most animals quickly discover that water flows from the tube when the stain-
less steel ball is gently pushed in. I have even witnessed my ingenious ferrets
holding the ball in with a toenail to allow for more water to flow out.
Keeping the water bottle filled and the cage clean can be temporarily tedious,
but it’s well worth the effort in the end. Just through curiosity, most ferrets
figure out the workings of the water bottle and do so without risking danger-
ous dehydration, illness, and possible death.
Designing Your Ferret’s Bathroom
Ferrets are naturally clean animals that can and should be trained to use a
kitty litter box. Therefore, you need to equip your ferret’s castle with a suit-
able bathroom. Believe it or not, you have some things to consider before
running out and buying the first plastic cat box you see. The first thing is the
size of the cage door through which you plan on shoving the litter box (this is
where custom cages with built-in, pull-out litter pans can be convenient; see
the earlier section “Setting Up Fuzzy’s Cage”). In most instances, you won’t
have a problem, but be sure to double-check the size of your door. I’ve had
many brilliant ideas foiled due to the width of the cage door! There are some
very big housecats out there and some very big litter boxes.
You also need to consider the size of the cage and of your ferret family. Your
ferret’s cage should have at least one litter box, but large cages and cages
with several ferrets should contain a minimum of two boxes. You’ll find that
corners are coveted spots for pooping, and a corner is the best place for a
litter box. Keep that in mind when shopping for cages, as well.
Never, ever use plastic litter-box liners in any ferret litter box. Your ferret will
tear them to shreds, and ingesting this material can cause serious blockage.
78
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Choosing the right litter box for your ferret
The type of pooper(s) you have determines the most suitable litter box for
you. His age and health status make a difference, too (see Part IV for more on
health issues). Here are some things to think about:
 Ferrets who aim high (those, for example, who scoot their butts up to
the corners and aim for the peaks of the poop hills) need litter boxes
with high sides. Ferrets that don’t much care where they go (the ones,
for example, who enter the box and squat down to do their business as
soon as all four feet are in) are probably okay with a low-sided litter box.
 As ferrets age, they may lose mobility in their hind legs, which can make
getting into litter boxes more difficult. The same holds true for the sick
or injured guys. Invest in a low-sided box for a debilitated fuzzball, even
if he has a temporary condition.
 Baby ferrets are full of energy, and they can and will get into almost any-
thing. If your ferret is too small to get into a litter box, it may be too
soon to be training him to use it.
 If you have a super-duper big cage, a covered litter box may be feasible.
Perhaps you need a combination of both a low-sided box, which may do
well on the bottom level (see Figure 5-5), and a high-sided box, which
you can put on a top level if it fits, or vice versa. Also available are
smaller triangular boxes that fit only in the corner of the cage. They sit
low in the front and very high in the back. However, most ferrets prefer
to use litter boxes that they can get all four feet in.
Finding the right litter box for your ferret may be a crapshoot at first. If
you’re a good observer, you can figure out what your ferret’s litter-box needs
are. On the other hand, I’m a good observer, and I have ferrets that make me
move the boxes all around. I think they do it just to keep me on my toes!
Plastic litter boxes
Your ferret will most likely have a durable, plastic kitty litter box that comes
from a pet shop or pet supply store. These are inexpensive and easy to
replace when they become worn out. Also, they come in many shapes and
sizes to fit your ferret’s cage and needs. You may also find a particular color
that fits your choice of decorating.
What about those plastic boxes with rims around the top to help keep the
litter in the box? Some people like this feature. I find the rim to be an ineffec-
tive weapon against talented litter pitchers, which most ferrets pride them-
selves in being. Additionally, most rims aren’t fitted well enough to the litter
boxes and become just another object tossed about the cage.
79
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters

Slide-in metal litter boxes
Some ferret cages have built-in metal slide-in/pull-out litter boxes. Just open
the little door and pull out the box for easy cleaning. This type of box fits
snugly into its own space, which eliminates the need to secure it. This may
sound perfect, but it has its own problems. My ferrets drag their bedding into
it, so I’ve inserted a short Plexiglas barrier to prevent this. Perhaps the worst
thing about this type of box is that after a year or so — depending on the
amount of urine it receives — the bottom of the metal pan slowly corrodes,
which leads to holes.
Here are a few things you can do to prevent the corroding, or at least delay it:
 You can line the bottom and 1⁄2 inch of the sides with contact paper. The
contact paper is okay, but it doesn’t last very long and eventually peels
or cracks when you clean it.
 You can cut a fitted piece of linoleum and place it on the bottom of the
pan. This fix works fairly well, but you must remove the linoleum regu-
larly for cleaning when urine leaks under it.
 Another solution I’ve heard of is that you can spray the bottom of the
metal pan with a safe coating, such as cooking spray, in between clean-
ings. You also can paint the bottom with a nontoxic paint or coating,
such as Teflon.
Figure 5-5:

Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Most metal pans are longer than a typical plastic litter box. However, I put a
plastic litter box on my ferrets’ favorite side of the metal box, and I fill the
space that’s left over with litter. So, my large metal box is divided into two,
and the unprotected side gets little use — except for when I fail to clean the
box as often as I should. This solution may seem to defeat the purpose of the
built-in metal box, but the kitty litter box still fits in snugly, pulls out with the
metal box, and isn’t tossed about the cage.
Picking out the perfect litter
Don’t think that the cheap, generic litter you can force a cat to use will do for
your ferret. In most cases, cats are cleaner about their toilet habits. They go
into the box, do their duty, politely cover it up, and exit quickly to be sure
that no one saw who issued that smell. Ferrets are different. They dig and
burrow in their litter. They toss it about as they roughhouse with each other
or a favorite toy. Some drag their bedding into the litter box and go to sleep.
A litter box is to most ferrets what a sandbox is to a creative child. Therefore,
picking litter for your ferret requires more than simply picking up the cheap-
est litter in the kitty aisle of your grocery store.
The litter you choose for your fuzzball should be absorbent and as free of
dust as possible. Also, get bigger pieces because litter gets stuck in the
strangest of places and can cause illness. The following list presents the
options for your litter-snorkeling fuzzy:
 Pelleted litters: I prefer pelleted litter to the other types of litters avail-
able, and many consider it the best litter for ferrets. It exists in many
forms on the pet market. Most are made from plant fibers or recycled
newspaper. For the most part, pelleted litters rate high on the absorb-
ency scale. Some of these litters are even considered digestible in case
of accidental or intentional ingestion. Most varieties are fairly dust-free
and free of perfumes, and they’re difficult for a ferret to shove up his
tiny nose. Although no litter is completely safe from the throws of ferret
paws, pelleted litter is heavier and bigger, making it a little harder to
toss overboard.
 Wood stove pellets: Made of compressed wood chips, wood stove pel-
lets are rapidly becoming a favorite litter among ferret owners, right up
there with pelleted litters. Wood stove pellets are inexpensive and do a
great job of controlling odor. You can find this product at major home-
improvement centers and many other stores.
 Clay litter: Clay litter is very popular among both cat and ferret fanciers.
It’s cheap, abundant, fairly absorbent, and you can find it anywhere, even
the grocery store. Most clay litters, however — even the ones that claim
to be 99-percent dust-free — produce a ton of dust. Just because you can’t
see it when it settles after the initial pour doesn’t mean the dust isn’t
there. Regular playing, digging, and walking on the litter upsets the dust.
81
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters

Respiratory problems can develop over a period of time if your ferret
inhales too much dust. Bits of clay litter (along with scoopable litter)
easily find ways into a ferret’s ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. Also, clay
(and scoopable) litters can stick between a little ferret’s toes, not to men-
tion cling to his little butt when he scoots it across the litter after going.
Additionally, because ferrets burrow through litter and sit in it, clay litter
coats their hair and dries it out as well as attracting more dirt to the coat.
 Scoopable litter: Scoopable litter is another popular choice. The absorb-
ency of high-quality scoopable litter is excellent, making it convenient
and easy to clean. It may have a pretty smell (before use, of course) or it
may be odorless. Many, but not all, scoopable litters can be flushed right
down the toilet along with the poop and urine. However, scoopable litter
is incredibly dusty. The consistency is as fine as sand, making it easier to
inhale and ingest. This is one I don’t recommend for ferrets.
You must take extra caution with newly bathed or wet ferrets. Like dogs,
ferrets go bonkers after baths. They roll around and wipe themselves
across every surface available, including the litter box. Water +
scoopable litter = cement. It dries quickly and can be very tedious to
clean. Your ferret’s eyes, ears, nose, mouth, toes, and behind can be sub-
ject to scoopable-litter impaction.
 Corncob litter: Although it’s decorative to some degree, my experience
with corncob litter says that you’re just asking for trouble. First off, this
litter is so light and airy that most of it is out of the litter box in no time.
It isn’t very absorbent, and it molds quickly; and mold can lead to respi-
ratory disease. And many ferrets just can’t resist nibbling on it a little,
which can lead to a bowel impaction. Perhaps the only good thing I can
say about corncob litter is that it isn’t dusty.
 Newspaper: You may find that a plain sheet of newspaper or shredded
newspaper works well for your ferret’s litter. Although it isn’t pretty,
newspaper is cheap and does the job. Litter material is the only reason
I subscribe to my local newspaper!
Acquiring Accessories and
Other Stuff Fuzzy Needs
Ferrets are curious, active, and intelligent creatures. Picking out a suitable
cage and throwing in the basic necessities isn’t enough to make your fuzzy
comfortable and happy. A ferret needs stimulation. You can add some extras
to his cage, his playtime, and his life for his amusement and yours. Have a
little fun and regularly rearrange his townhouse. Doing so also makes the
cage look neater in your home. In the following sections, I introduce the
accessories you can add to your ferret’s cage and the accessories you can
use to travel around with your fuzzy.
82
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Fluffing up extra snoozing sites
No ferret’s home is complete without at least one hanging hammock (see
Figure 5-6). Hammocks come in all shapes and sizes. You can purchase one
from a pet store or make one yourself. A hammock should be made from soft
yet durable fabric and have hooks or clasps on all four corners to attach it to
the top of the cage. Your fuzzy’s hammock should be located near a shelf or
ramp so he has safe, easy access to it.
Some hammocks look more like hanging sleeping bags. Your ferret can
choose to sleep right on top of it or snuggle between the two layers of fabric.
I’ve had some ferrets who liked to squish inside a hammock with another pile
of ferrets heaped on top of them. It reminds me of circus clowns crammed in
a VW Bug (just when you think it can’t possibly hold anymore . . .).
You need to provide warm, dark places for your ferret to hide out and sleep
in. Ferrets need to burrow and feel safe. You can utilize nest boxes for opti-
mal stress control. A general rule is that the number of nest boxes should
equal the number of ferrets plus one. If you don’t give your fuzzy security,
he’ll likely suffer cage stress.
Because tunneling is a ferret’s favorite extracurricular activity, you may want
to hang some plastic tubes in your fuzzy’s cage. Ferrets enjoy running
through them and even curling up for a nap. The tubes are easy to clean and
colorful, so they brighten up the cage area. You can find them in major pet
supply stores or online ferret supply stores. They’re made specifically for 
ferrets.

Ferret toys galore!
Ferrets are materialistic critters with an eye for valuables. Although you
probably won’t be able to prevent the thieving of some of your prized
possessions, you can provide your ferret with his own valued toys. In addi-
tion to providing entertainment, toys help to satisfy your ferret’s natural
instinct to hoard food. But you need to know what toys are safe and what
toys are bad ideas.
Good toys
Your ferret should be able to enjoy an assortment of toys both in the cage
and out. Try to keep up with his level of intelligence and curiosity, and provide
him with as much excitement as possible. Here are some toys you can use:
 Hard rubber balls (maybe even one with a bell safely inside)
 Cat toys that are made of hard plastic
 Tennis balls and racquetballs
 Paper bags and cardboard boxes
 Human infant toys, such as plastic keys and rattles and terry-cloth-cov-
ered squeaky things
 Large ferret balls — the kind that have holes in them for entering and
exiting
 Fun tunneling toys like PVC piping, clothes-dryer hoses, and ferret tubes
 The best ferret toy ever: you!
Ferrets love noisy toys, so find some safe toys that have bells inside or that
squeak. You can hang some toys in his cage for extra fun — large, dangling
parrot toys work well. Squeaky toys, though, should never be left unsuper-
vised in the cage or in the play area, because they can be chewed. Instead,
use them for one-on-one enrichment (see Chapter 10).
You need to inspect toys routinely. Throw away any toys that have stuffing
pulled out, and pay close attention to squeaky toys, because ferrets have
been known to pull out the squeakers and ingest them.
Toys to avoid
Exercise caution when purchasing playthings for your fuzzball. Most of the
toys in the market are designed for dogs and cats. Ferrets love to chew and
gnaw and destroy the stuff they covet so fiercely. However, their bodies don’t
process the junk in quite the same manner as dogs and cats’ bodies do. If
your fuzzy eats something he shouldn’t, you’ll find occasional bits of foreign
gunk, such as rubber or plastic, in his poop. More often, what doesn’t choke
84
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

him usually finds a nice place to settle in his stomach or intestine and causes
just enough damage to warrant immediate medical attention — not to men-
tion extreme panic for you. A best-case scenario: You can give a major dose
of kitty or ferret hairball remedy (1⁄2 tablespoon) to help push it on through. A
bad-case scenario: Fuzzy has to have surgery to remove the blockage. And
the most awful scenario of all: Death that could’ve been prevented.
Here are some things you don’t want to use as ferret toys:
 Any toy made of latex or soft, flexible rubber/plastic, including unsuper-
vised squeaky toys
 Anything with small pieces that your ferret can chew off and swallow
 Objects small enough that your ferret can get his head stuck in them
 Toys that show signs of ferret wear and tear
Your ferret will try to pilfer through your belongings and come up with a few
toys you’ve obviously forgotten about, including socks, shoes, car keys, lip-
stick, and various other sundries. If you’re a smoker, watch your cigarettes,
too. Ferrets find them wonderfully fascinating, but they’re not only toxic, but
also can cause obstructions. You also should avoid bedding that contains
foam rubber or stuffing.
Ferret owners should monitor their ferrets when it comes to playing with cer-
tain toys. For example, I don’t include plastic bags in the “toys to avoid” list,
mainly because ferrets love them! They make great enrichment toys. You do
need to monitor their use, though. Don’t leave the bags in the cage or unat-
tended with your ferret. Bags and other potentially dangerous items can
make great play items if you’re diligent at watching and supervising the play.
That’s not to say, however, that all toys are safe even with proper monitoring.
Some objects are flat out dangerous. Use common sense.
Leashes and harnesses for your ferret
Ferrets can learn to be walked on leashes, provided that they have comfort-
ably fitting harnesses. Leashes and harnesses are especially important if you
plan on taking your ferret outside for romps or when you have guests over
who want to get to know your fuzzbutt. You can purchase many types of har-
nesses, but the long, slender body of the ferret makes him a difficult fit. You
should choose a harness made specifically for ferrets — one that’s H-shaped
across the back and that fastens around the neck and belly (see Figure 5-7).
Just like a puppy, your ferret will resist the sudden restraint on his freedom.
He’ll twist and turn and play tug of war as though he’s truly claustrophobic.
He’ll do the typical alligator roll and fake a horrible torture. Believe me — he’ll
85
Chapter 5: Home Sweet Home: Preparing Your Ferret’s Quarters

get over it. As long as you can squeeze your finger under the harness, you
can be sure that it isn’t too tight. Ferrets are master escape artists. Any
looser and your ferret will be free in no time. Be patient and persistent with
your teachings and reward him for good behavior. Unless you use the har-
ness only when taking him to the vet, he’ll eventually associate it with play-
time. (For more tips on getting him used to the harness, see Chapter 19.)

Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 
Not cuckoo about collars
Some people put collars on their ferrets with
little success; others do so with good results. I
suppose it depends on the ferret’s personality
and his ability to tolerate a collar. A ferret’s head
isn’t much wider than the neck it’s attached to.
I find it next to impossible to keep a collar on for
long, including those “designed specifically for
ferrets.” A collar is a collar. It’s all round, and it’s
no match for a ferret who wants to eliminate it.
Collars become coveted objects for the hidey-
hole, though. They also get caught on things —
especially if they have bells on them. This may
cause entrapment or strangulation. Use a collar
with caution. You’ll never catch one of my guys
wearing one!

Finding a good travel taxi
A travel taxi is probably one of the first accessories you’ll want to purchase
after you have your ferret’s cage set up. After all, your baby needs to arrive
home safely. Ferrets are neat, and it’s fun to show them off, but a vehicle isn’t
a safe place to showcase your fuzzy. He can get stuck under the seat and
under a pedal. He can obstruct your view by cruising on the dashboard. All
this stuff can cause an accident, and an unrestrained fuzzy is too vulnerable
to come out of a serious accident in one piece.
Consider the following when looking for an appropriate travel taxi:
 A simple, small, plastic cat carrier can comfortably accommodate a
couple of ferrets for short trips to the vet or to grandmother’s house.
The carrier should contain a soft towel or other type of bedding for com-
fort and snoozing. Most carriers are designed for adequate ventilation,
so that shouldn’t be much of a worry.
 Avoid folding cardboard carriers that shelters or pet shops may send
you home with. It doesn’t take long for a ferret to figure his way out of
one by scratching or chewing. Cardboard carriers also can’t be properly
sanitized. You don’t want to have ferret pee leak through the bottom of a
cardboard carrier and onto your car seat.
 Carriers that open like suitcases are okay for short trips, but for longer
trips, a carrier with a wire-grated, front-opening door (see Figure 5-8) is
more appropriate. Larger carriers of the same type (made for small or
medium-sized dogs) are appropriate for temporarily housing ferrets on
trips, because one can hold a small litter box in addition to the ferrets
and their bedding.
As much as I hate to admit this, not everyone enjoys ferrets as much as I do.
When traveling to the vet or other places, keep your ferret contained in case
you run across one of these oddball people. My vet doesn’t like it when I
come waltzing in with a 10-foot snake draped around my neck. It scares the
poodle owners! So I bring snakes to the vet in reptile carriers. Your pet car-
rier (minus the snake) is the safest place for your furball anyway. Strangers
poking at him may be too much stimulation for your little guy, and he may
nip out of fear or excitement. Unless you’re in a comfortable and ferret-
friendly environment, keep your fuzzy safe in his carrier.

Chapter 6
Ferret-Proofing Your Home
In This Chapter
 Taking care of trouble spots in your home to make it ferret-friendly
 Altering your habits to prevent a tragedy
 Finding a qualified vet
A
t first, your home is a scary yet stimulating jungle to a tiny ferret, and
she’ll be chomping at the bit to find or cause trouble. And believe me, if
she’s able to find or cause trouble, she certainly will. Carpet sharks are noto-
rious explorers and excavators. They like to push and pull and carry and toss
every little household item they can. They can fit into the tiniest of tiny
places and manage their way to the highest of spots. And they all put their
leaping skills to the greatest challenge. Whoever came up with the phrase
“Curiosity killed the cat” obviously hadn’t been exposed to ferrets. Curiosity,
although one of the ferret’s most amusing qualities, can be her worst enemy.
Therefore, from the time your new fuzzy first walks into her new home, the
environment should be ferret-proofed. In this chapter, you find out how to get
your house ready for your new arrival. I also explain what habits you can
change to keep your ferret safe and let you know how to cross off your next
important priority: finding a good vet for your fuzzy.
Inspecting Your Home for Ferret Hazards
With the possible exception of a single closed-off room (a rubber-padded
cell?) with no furniture, holes, or floor vents, most areas in a home can’t be
completely ferret-proofed. You have to be satisfied with doing your absolute
best to minimize the possibilities of ferret tragedies. Like the parent of a tod-
dler, you must keep your pet out of harm’s way. However, unlike a human tod-
dler, a ferret will rarely scream out for you when she hurts herself or gets
wedged somewhere. Your fuzzbutt depends on you to remain vigilant at all
times when she’s out of her cage.

90
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 
The following list outlines some general guidelines for ferret-proofing your
home:
 Put up security gates to keep ferrets from danger zones. Don’t settle
for easily climbed children’s gates; those are just neat obstacles for a
ferret to scale and master like a ladder. You may have to build something
at least 3 feet high out of wood, Plexiglas, or another material that fer-
rets can’t easily climb.
 Be careful what you leave lying around your home. Any object is fair
game to a ferret. Some dangerous items include pen caps, rubber bands,
cotton balls and cotton swabs, coins, latex/vinyl/rubbery things,
sponges, plastic bags, jewelry, foam rubber, latex rubber, polyester stuff-
ing, dried vegetables, and bandages.
 Don’t store chemicals, such as cleaners or antifreeze, in accessible
places. Ferrets can knock the containers over, causing spills, and ingest
poisonous chemicals. At the very least, they’ll want to lick the contain-
ers just for a taste and may ingest chemical residue.
 Put your medications out of reach. You may be aware that prescription
meds can be extremely dangerous and toxic to your ferret, but you may
not know that many over-the-counter medications, such as Tylenol, can
be as deadly as rat poison to your ferret.
 Don’t forget that ferrets can jump. You should ferret-proof anything less
than 30 inches off the ground or that your ferret can reach by climbing.
Some people leave their ferrets out of their cages to go unsupervised all day. I
believe only an experienced ferret owner can pull this off without too many
hitches. A person confident enough to leave a ferret unsupervised knows the
ferret inside and out and knows the ways of ferret-proofing.
You get the idea. Think and prepare as though you have a toddler exploring
your environment. Everything a toddler touches ends up in his mouth. A
ferret isn’t that different. The following sections lead you through ferret-
proofing the different areas of your home and point out dangers that you may
not have thought about. The bits of wisdom in these sections are made possi-
ble by all the close calls, injuries, and fatalities experienced by thousands of
ferret lovers all over the country, including myself. Learn from our mistakes!
Laundry room
Utility/laundry rooms often are loaded with dangerous items, and they’re
practically impossible to ferret-proof, so you should keep these rooms off-
limits altogether. Your ferret may decide to chew on the dryer vent hose and
tunnel right out through to the scary outside. Even worse, your fuzzy could
quickly crawl up into the clothes dryer to take a nap beneath all those soft
clothes, especially when they’re warm. You may not see her go in, and it will
be too late when you do find her.

Kitchen
Block off your kitchen from curious ferrets if you can. You want to keep your
fuzzy away from all those dangerous appliances in the kitchen. Here are a few
of the ways your fuzzy can get hurt in the kitchen:
 Refrigerators and other appliances have fans that can abruptly turn on
and injure or kill your ferret.
 Ingested fiberglass insulation can cause blockages or severe illness.
 Stoves have pilot lights that can cause severe burns.
 All appliances have electrical cords that can cause electrocution when
chewed on.
 Your ferret can get severely wedged inside a space in an appliance and
suffocate before you get the chance to rescue her.
 If you’re like I am, you keep your bottom kitchen cabinets filled with
cleaners that are poisonous if swallowed by your ferret.
I’ve known ferrets to climb into dishwashers, refrigerators, and freezers when
no one’s looking. You can imagine the worst-case scenarios! Ferrets are
adventure seekers, and they’ll try anything once. But sometimes once is all
the chance they’ll ever get.
Moldings, baseboards, and under cabinets
Get on your belly and make sure that all the moldings and baseboards in your
home are intact and complete all around the rooms. You don’t want any mys-
tery spaces. Double-check with your hands beneath the cabinets to make
sure that your ferret can’t get up into the cabinets from under the ledges.
Home builders often seem to skimp in this area.
Also check for holes that lead into walls or to the great outdoors. Any hole
wider than one inch is a potential hidey-hole or danger zone. Board all these
holes up. If a hole is less than one inch wide, decide whether your ferret can
widen it with her teeth or claws. After all, drywall and similar materials are
no match for a fuzzy’s weapons.
Windows and doors
To prevent escapes and falls from high places, double-check the safety of
your windows, doors, and screens. Make sure your screens are securely fas-
tened and your doors are shut tight while your fuzzy is prowling. Also, you
91
Chapter 6: Ferret-Proofing Your Home

probably shouldn’t open any accessible window when your ferret is out and
about. An exposed screen, likewise, isn’t very hard to tear open or pull out
with teeth or claws.
How big are the gaps between the bottoms of your doors and the floor? More
than one inch? Better lower them to prevent your ferret from scooting under
or getting stuck. Don’t underestimate the average furball!
It won’t take long for your ferret to realize that she has the strength and
smarts to open some doors and windows. You can use snap bolts to keep her
safely inside your home (see Chapter 5).
Floor vents and air returns
Your ferret may be able to pull off your floor vents and air returns if they
aren’t secure. I know my floor vent grates just lay loosely on top of the holes
they cover (for decoration, I guess). After a ferret gets into a vent, she can
tunnel through the house and get stuck somewhere or fall to a place where
she can’t get out.
Try to securely fasten any loose grates with small pieces of Velcro. It’s effec-
tive, and you can hide the strips from view.
Floor fans can be dangerous to your fuzzy. A moving fan blade can remove a
toe, paw, or tail tip (or worse). If the blade protector on your fan (the cage
covering the fan) is broken, your ferret may decide to explore and end up in
deep trouble. Don’t use fans near your free-roaming ferret.
Plants
Your ferret will try to taste all your plants, and some plants are poisonous
when eaten. She’ll also promptly remove every trace of dirt from the pot,
because ferrets are excellent diggers. The problem is, some dirt contains
harmful bacteria or chemicals from fertilizers or pesticides.
Heights
Look around you. Everything in your home is a potential stepstool, ladder, or
launching pad, including your fuzzy’s townhouse (see Chapter 5 for more on
fuzzy cages). You may need to move or block certain items to prevent your
ferret from getting too high up. Pay close attention to how accessible your
stairwells, curtain rods, and countertops are. A significant fall almost always
injures a ferret, and sometimes it can be fatal.
92
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Electrical cords
Ooooh, electrical cords seem like yummy chew toys to the grazing ferret. In
the eyes of pet owners, though, electrical cords are electrocutioners and fire
starters. Try applying bitter- or sour-tasting spray (available at most pet
stores) on the cords to deter the ferret’s gnawing urge. Another simple solu-
tion is to wrap electrical cords in aluminum foil. Most ferrets don’t enjoy
chewing on foil. However, the best solution is to keep all electrical cords com-
pletely out of your ferret’s reach or to enclose them in special cable or cord
moldings, available at home improvement stores.
Reclining chairs, rockers, 
and foldout couches
Many furniture items can be death traps. It’s easy to plop down into a rocker
or recliner and forget the danger of crushing your romping ferret in between
the moving parts. I suggest that you don’t use reclining chairs, rockers, or
foldouts when your ferret is out playing or that you keep them out of your
ferret’s play-designated space. I, for instance, make everyone sit on the floor
when my fuzzies are out and about!
Fireplaces
Nothing can match a walk on the wild side for your fuzzy, and fireplaces have
it all: wood, dirt, and sometimes even rocks. If you want to keep your ferret
and house soot-free, make your fireplace off-limits to snorkeling ferrets. You
can invest in a heavy-duty fireplace grill that ferrets can’t climb and that you
can push flush against the fireplace. I went another route and installed glass
doors on our fireplace.
Mattresses, couches, and chairs
Ferrets can easily crawl beneath most couches and chairs or the cushions on
them, and they’ll be tempted to do so. Mattresses are just as alluring. Those
places make good hidey-holes, and the fabric beneath the furniture is awfully
enticing. The danger is that you can squish your ferret between the cushions
or under the chair if you unknowingly sit on her.
Many ferrets are tempted to dig and chew and tear at the underside fabric of
furniture, often creating holes. Besides being detrimental to the furniture,
chewing holes often allows furballs to find the stuffing that’s revealed behind
93
Chapter 6: Ferret-Proofing Your Home

the protective fabric cloth. The same goes for mattresses. Ferrets love to
chew on soft, foamy, rubbery things. If your ferret ingests the foam or other
stuffing, intestinal blockage can occur.
Some ferret people prefer to use futons rather than traditional couches and
chairs. Or, when the time comes to replace their furniture, ferret people
choose to buy couches and chairs that are flush against the floor so their fer-
rets can’t get under them. If these aren’t viable options for you, you can turn
your chairs and couches over and try to staple some heavy-duty cloth to the
bottoms to keep your ferret out. Remember to staple close together so she
can’t get in between the staples.
Most ferret owners don’t need to go to such extremes if they keep a close eye
on their fuzzies during play time and inspect their furniture routinely for
signs of destruction. And look before you sit!
Toilets, bathtubs, and buckets
Supervised recreational swimming can be fun for some fuzzies, but even the
most athletic ferret risks drowning after a while. To prevent accidents, keep
the lids down on toilets and keep bathroom doors closed when you have
bathtubs full of water. Buckets of water or other liquids can also pose a
drowning threat. Even if your ferret doesn’t drown, she may become violently
ill if she swims in a chemical of some sort.
Many bathmats and area rugs have rubber backings to prevent slippage.
Unfortunately, these backings are delicious and sometimes deadly to fuzzies.
Even the little rubber tips on door stops can block your ferret’s intestinal
tract when ingested. Watch for signs of interest in these items. You can easily
pick up bathmats and rugs during playtime, and if necessary, you can remove
the baseboard doorstops and replace them with stops that fasten to the tops
of doors.
Cabinets
A ferret is quick to discover that she can easily pry open accessible cabinet
doors. I don’t recommend using most child latches as a solution. Most child
latches are designed so that you have to slip your hand in and release the
latches to open the cabinets. And if you can slip your hand in, the cabinet
opens just enough for your ferret to come on in or get her head caught.
However, certain child latches are designed to work just fine. For example,
one uses a magnet to release the latch on the inside of the cabinet door.
94
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Supervise your ferret when she’s playing around cabinets, and be sure that
they don’t contain dangerous chemicals or small ingestible objects. Also,
make sure that your low cabinets don’t have holes that can lead to other
awaiting dangers. For example, I have one cabinet that has a poorly fitted
pipe coming through the bottom of it. I can see right down to the basement!
Trash cans
Garbage cans are simply irresistible to roving ferrets. Think of all the disgust-
ing and dangerous items you throw away on a daily basis. Would you want a
fuzzy kiss from a ferret that just had her nose in all that?
Keep all your garbage cans out of your fuzzy’s reach when she’s out. If she
has access, she’ll tip them over or find a way into them. Depending on what’s
in the trash, your ferret’s curiosity could kill her or make her terribly ill. And
who’s to say you won’t accidentally throw out your fuzzy with the trash if she
climbs in and curls up for a snooze with a stinky banana peel? Fix your cans
with sturdy lids and keep them completely out of your ferret’s reach.
So, you can’t put all your trash cans up high or fasten them tightly with
sturdy lids. Tired of fishing trash out of hidey-holes? Exasperated at the
thought of sweeping up half-dried coffee grounds for the third time this
week? Try weighing down your garbage can. Place about five pounds of sand
or smooth round pebbles in the bottom so your fuzzy can’t tip the can!
Changing Some of Your Home Habits
Those of you with children may remember those selfish days when you could
do anything your own way without needing to take others into consideration.
Those of you without children may be there now! For every potential ferret
owner: You can kiss your selfish days goodbye. Well, maybe the adjustment
isn’t as drastic as that, but you need to be prepared to adjust your habits and
daily routine. Your furball is depending on you for survival.
The following list presents some actions you should make part of your daily
fuzzy-owning routine:
 Watch where you step, and don’t carry stuff that blocks your vision. A
ferret’s favorite place to be and snooze is under things: carpets and rugs
(hence the nickname “carpet sharks”), clothing, pet beds, you name it.
Shuffle your feet when walking if you have to. Ferrets are quick and
quiet. They can be underfoot in a flash. Tread lightly, for a ferret is
bound to be close at foot.
95
Chapter 6: Ferret-Proofing Your Home

 Check the clothes dryer and washer thoroughly before operating
them. Also check carefully before you toss a load of clothes into the
washer. Ferrets aren’t bulky and heavy like bricks. You’ll hardly notice if
your fuzzy has burrowed into your dirty underwear (assuming you’re
not wearing them at the time).
 Don’t plop lazily onto the couch or chair. If your fuzzy isn’t under the
furniture, she may be under the cushions. Also, the moving parts in a
reclining chair or sofa can injure or kill your ferret.
 Don’t leave small objects lying around. Stealing is an endearing but
sometimes deadly ferret trait. If your fuzzy doesn’t eat or chew a small
object up, she may hide it — and hide it well. You may not find your
stolen objects for a very long time. This is particularly annoying if the
item your fuzzy steals is valuable.
 Don’t open or close doors quickly. You may startle or, worse, acciden-
tally injure your ferret. The same goes for cabinets, drawers, refrigera-
tors, freezers, washers, dryers, and dishwashers.
Getting a Vet
Every ferret has different medical needs, and not all veterinarians are trained
equally when it comes to the health and well being of ferrets. Although fer-
rets are the third most popular carnivorous pet in America — topped only by
dogs and cats — they’re far less popular in the vet’s office. Some vets just
don’t like ferrets; others get hung up on the common misconceptions people
have about fuzzies.
It’s important to seek out a veterinarian who’s comfortable and experienced
with ferret medicine before you bring a new fuzzy into your home. You want
to ensure that your ferret will have the best routine medical care available.
More importantly, you won’t jeopardize your pet’s life while doing the panic
shuffle if an emergency arises. You’ll have done your research, and you’ll
know who to call.

before you enlist his or her services, head to the chapters in Part IV.

ringing home a new ferret often means that you must face the delicate
issue of introducing your new family member to your existing family
members. It may not be as easy as you think. Take, for example, your domes-
tic kitty that’s used to being king or queen of the roost. An arrogant ruler, no
doubt. Your cat will be dethroned, as will your spouse or any other member
of the household, when your new ferret takes his spot by your side.
Knowing how to interact safely with your fuzzy on a one-to-one basis in his
new surroundings is imperative, and this chapter tells you how. This chapter
also offers insight into the social aspect of ferrets. These creatures aren’t all
they appear to be; they’re even more wonderful than I can put on paper. That
said, I discuss sticky subjects such as how to teach your kids to be safe and
appropriate around fuzzbutts. Finally, I explain how to introduce your fuzzy
to Fido and Fluffy, as well as to those neighbors who just have to stick their
noses in your business.
You should quarantine any new ferret you bring into your home for at least
two weeks until you know for sure he isn’t sick. Although he may look healthy
when you bring him home, he may be harboring parasites or transmittable ill-
nesses. Some serious ferret illnesses will flare their ugly heads only during
stressful times, like a sudden change of environment. To quarantine, find a
comfortable cage for your new ferret and house him at least two rooms away

98
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 
from your existing clan. Always feed and clean your new ferret last and
remember to wash your hands thoroughly between handling ferrets. Wear
another shirt over your clothing when handling your new ferret and leave it
in the new ferret’s room when you leave or go back and forth between ferret
rooms. Most importantly, remind all members of the household to follow the
same rules, or else the quarantine isn’t a quarantine at all. When the quaran-
tine period is over, the introductions can begin!
Ferrets as Social Animals
Ferret-owning humans swear up and down that ferrets are incredibly social
critters. The fact is, polecats, ferrets included, are solitary animals with terri-
torial tendencies. They don’t act like dogs, which seek out other dogs, form
packs, and travel around in groups. If you were to release three ferrets of the
same gender in your backyard, they would more than likely go in three sepa-
rate directions. In the wild, polecats defend their territories fervently against
polecats of the same gender. (Naturally, if a member of the opposite sex
enters a polecat’s territory, she’s more than welcome to stay awhile.)
The need to be solitary and territorial is, for the most part, kept under con-
trol by our beloved domestic ferrets under normal circumstances. But make
no mistake about it: Although they play with and tolerate each other to the
delight of all onlookers, ferrets maintain little unspoken territories, and at
times they squabble with trespassers or thieves. However, there’s a reason
that thousands of ferret owners coo to themselves as they watch their babies
pile in big sleepy heaps at the end of the day. Ferrets, after proper introduc-
tions, will view other ferrets as littermates and play about accordingly.
They’ll wrestle and dance as though they’re the best of buddies, and in many
cases, they can be the best of buddies. The simple fact is that ferrets estab-
lish a hierarchy amongst themselves and stake out microterritories in their
tiny domains. In this way, are they really that different from us?
You and Your New Ferret: Making 
the Most of Your Friendship
Most ferrets enjoy the companionship of humans. It probably won’t take long
before your new fuzzy sees you as the perfect playmate — assuming you’re
willing to play nicely with him. To get to that stage, you have to make your
fuzzy comfortable in your arms and in his surroundings. Sometimes, it takes a
little bit of patience and extra understanding before you begin to feel that
your ferret has bonded with you.

Your body movements and tone of voice can influence his reactions to you. The
age of your ferret and his history (some ferrets come with emotional baggage;
see Chapter 20) also may determine how quickly he blends into your family.
Before you introduce your ferret to other family members, get to know him
better and learn how to properly interact with him. The following sections
show you how.
Hold me gently, please? (Why
a question mark?)
In order to introduce your fuzzy to your family and to others, you need to
become comfortable holding him — and he needs to be comfortable being
held. Many healthy ferrets maintain the “I’d rather be anywhere than in your
arms” position. In most cases, it has nothing to do with how you’re actually
holding the little guy (see Figure 7-1 for an example). There are always excep-
tions to the rule, though. I’ve run across many furballs who love to be held
and cuddled. Usually, these guys are the older, more mature ferrets who have
come to appreciate humans over the years.
To hold your ferret, support both his front and back legs in your arms (see
Figure 7-1). Supporting his entire body is important. I can assure you that
he’ll try to move around quite a bit and probably try to crawl up your chest
and onto your shoulder — maybe even onto your head! You can adjust his
position, but remember not to squeeze his little body too tightly. You may
find that sitting down and holding him on your lap works better for you. Use
a treat such as Linatone or Ferretone to entice him into staying put.
If your ferret decides to nip you in protest of being held, don’t reward the
behavior by putting him down to play. You don’t want to give in to his bad
behavior, because he’ll know what to do in the future when he wants down.
Instead, if he nips, immediately tell him “No!” and place him in his cage. This
way, your fuzzy will begin to associate biting with jail time (for more, see
Chapter 19).
Scruffing, if done correctly, is a safe and painless way to hold a ferret when
you need him to remain still for activities like trimming nails and cleaning
ears. Simply grab the large, thick patch of skin behind his neck with your
entire hand and lift him up. His hanging body should naturally remain still.
You should support his bottom, especially if he’s a heavy furball. However,
note that the more support his bottom receives, the more he can move
around. You should use scruffing mainly when more control is necessary for
his safety or yours.

Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

Letting fuzzy set up shop in his home
I always advise people to allow their ferrets to get used to their new cages
before they introduce them to the wonders of their new surroundings
(Chapter 5 gives the lowdown on cages). This practice gives your ferret the
chance to soak in all the new smells, both good and bad (people can give off
funny scents!). Your ferret has a unique personality that you need to become
familiar with. Only time will allow this to happen. Ease your ferret into your
routine slowly; better yet, let him slowly ease you into his routine.
Figure 7-1:
Demonstrat-
ing proper
ways to hold
a ferret.
100
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

For starters, keep his cage in a convenient location — one that won’t allow
your 100-pound dog to rattle the cage every time she runs by. The following
list presents some more cage tips:
 Don’t allow the cage to become a resting shelf for your curious cat until
your ferret has become comfortable with having that particular cat
around (see the upcoming section “Fuzzy Meets Fluffy and Fido”).
 Instruct children and other family members to keep their fingers out of
the cage until your ferret has become comfortable with all the humans
around (see the section “Preparing Your Child for the Ferret”).
 If you like, you can partially cover the cage until you all get to know each
other.
After a day or two of letting your ferret settle into his new home, take him
to a different safe place, such as a bathroom. Sit down alone with some toys
and let your ferret explore you at his own pace. Move slowly and quietly, talk-
ing softly as you encourage him to play. Watch his body language to see how
comfortable he is with you. Some fuzzies are more laid back and eager to
accept the change in lifestyle. Others may maintain pipe-cleaner tails for
hours until they become more relaxed. When you become comfortable with
your ferret’s temperament in his new environment, you can begin to give him
more freedom. Let him roam first when the kids are at school and the other
pets are confined to another area of the house and then move on from there.
The steps to successful bonding
Bonding with your ferret is an important part of establishing and maintaining
a pet-loving, harmonious household. The rewards experienced as a result of
properly bonding with your ferret will guarantee you a lifetime of love. The
goal of bonding, after all, is to not only make life tolerable, but also to turn
your ferret into a lap pet and you into a friend for life.
Establishing a bond isn’t something that happens naturally or overnight. It
takes effort, time, and trust from both parties, and it’s an ongoing process.
Here are some activities you can engage in to help cement your bond with
your ferret:
 Playing: Ferrets need frequent human interaction to remain happy, and
you can provide this interaction and bond with your ferret by playing
with him. Whether you get down on your belly and roll around with him
or teach him new tricks, play is vital to your relationship. (See Chapter
10 for more information on play and enrichment.)
101
Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

 Holding: One of the best ways to bond with your ferret is to carry him
around with you (see the earlier section “Hold me gently, please? [Why a
question mark?]” for more on this topic). You can carry your ferret the
old-fashioned way by cradling him in your arms and taking him with you
from room to room, or you can just plant yourselves on the couch and
watch television. Time carrying your ferret around should be limited,
with frequent “down time” rests in between so that your ferret doesn’t
become too stressed and so he can take potty breaks.
 Grooming: Grooming your ferret is a natural bonding tool. The activity
mimics the way the ferret’s mother and littermates would groom him in
a familial environment. You should practice grooming rituals on a regu-
lar basis to enhance your bonding experience with your ferret; they’ll
help to soften even the most hardcore biter. (For more hygiene informa-
tion, see Chapter 9.) The following are some grooming activities that
promote bonding:
• Face rubbing and cleaning: Gently hold your ferret’s head, and
using your thumb or thumb and forefinger, stroke his face. I usually
use both hands to hold a ferret’s head, and I stroke his face with
my thumbs from his nose back to his ears. For the cleaning part,
you can take a warm, damp washcloth and gently stroke the face
fur in the same direction the fur goes (with the grain).
• Fur plucking: Fur plucking is quite simple to do, but you must 
doit gently. Use your thumb and forefinger to gingerly tug on a 
tuft of fur on your ferret’s head or neck. You also may tug on the
fur located on his neck and belly; I’ve found these areas to be 
the most accepting, although you can pluck any part of your
fuzzy’s fur.
• A warm, damp washcloth rubdown: This is one of the most effec-
tive grooming/bonding methods, but it takes a little practice and
getting used to for both parties. All you need is a small, damp (not
wet), warm washcloth. Starting at your ferret’s face and working
your way back, rub him with the washcloth. Move in the same
direction his fur flows. You may need to rinse and warm your wash-
cloth periodically.
Don’t forget his belly, his bottom, and his genitals! Remember, what
you want to do is mock his mother’s behavior. A washcloth rub-
down is not only a great way to bond with your ferret, but also a
good way to help keep him clean — at least a little.
All these bonding rituals are easy and can be done just about anywhere and
at anytime — even while you’re watching television. In addition to having a
calming and soothing effect on the ferret, the grooming good for your own
blood pressure!

Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Fuzzy Meets Fluffy and Fido
If you love ferrets (or are thinking of getting one so you can fall in love),
chances are you already have other pets in your home. You’ll probably be able
to introduce your ferret to your dogs and cats with no problems, provided that
you take the necessary steps to minimize the natural tension between them.
Not all ferrets have the same temperament; likewise, all cats and dogs have
unique personalities that influence pet-to-pet relationships. In addition, some
breeds of dogs (generally speaking) aren’t as good with ferrets as others.
As a rule, ferrets get along better with cats. Ferrets and dogs together present
unique conflicts that you should monitor closely. In the following sections, I
explain how you can introduce your ferret to both cats and dogs, and I briefly
cover other small animals in case you have your own miniature zoo at home!
Heeeere kitty, kitty!
Ferrets and cats can make great companions, depending on their tempera-
ments. I have three fat cats, and each one responds differently to my ferrets, and
vice versa. Butch is usually neutral around my ferrets, often feeling too crabby
to ferret around. Sometimes, though, he gets a wild hair up his heinie and waits
patiently around the corner for a ferret to amble by so he can make a tackle. Old
man Smokey has zero tolerance for ferret behavior. He either stays up high or
throws haphazard swats toward any fuzzy that’s curious enough to cop a sniff.
He then runs away and hides. Snickers, the youngest of the clan, is always up for
a good wrestle. He tolerates ferret antics and enjoys getting down and dirty with
all the furballs. They bite each other, take turns chasing, and play hide and seek.
Snickers, however, usually wears down the ferrets. Eventually they’ll run away
and seek solitude in a hidey-hole after an hour or two.
You can do your part to try to make all your pet relationships like the one
Snickers (or even Butch) and my ferrets have. To smooth the feline-ferret
introductions in your house, follow these steps, one cat at a time:
1. After your ferret gets comfortable in his new surroundings (see the
previous sections), allow kitty to move freely about the outside of the
ferret’s cage while fuzzy is inside.
Let them sniff each other, and watch how they react. You may see no
reaction at all.
2. Take your ferret out of his cage and hold him securely while both he
and kitty explore each other.
New smells are intriguing to ferrets. Both he and the cat may have
puffed tails.
103
Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

3. If all seems calm so far, put your ferret down and watch cautiously as
the two interact.
If conflict arises, end the meeting and try again later. It may take a few
meetings before everyone is completely comfortable.
Many people think that the ferret is the animal in the most danger during a
cat-ferret encounter. My experience has been that most healthy adult ferrets
can hold their own against cats and can even be more aggressive. Until you’re
sure that your ferret and cat can play nicely together, always supervise their
games. Even after you become comfortable, supervision is a good idea.
Adult ferrets have been known to kill kittens, so never leave an adult ferret
and a kitten unsupervised. Better yet, let your kitten develop into an arrogant
adolescent before subjecting her to ferret torture. It’s only fair!
Nice puppy!
The relationship between a dog and ferret can be a little more complicated
than the bond between a cat and ferret. Although cats come in different
breeds, they all have pretty similar characteristics and are similar in size.
Dogs, on the other hand, can be itty-bitty or massive in size and can be bred
for certain personality traits and job functions. You must take your dog’s size
and personality into consideration when introducing your ferret to her.
I’ve heard of many ferrets being killed by dogs, and the owners blame the
dogs. The fault usually lies with the human who wasn’t supervising the inter-
action or who didn’t take into consideration the personality of the dog. It’s
your responsibility to keep your fuzzy safe and healthy; it’s a dog’s responsi-
bility to be a dog.
Common dog/ferret characteristics
Although good dog-ferret relationships certainly do exist, I tend to mistrust
most dogs around ferrets for several reasons:
 Some breeds of dogs, like Terriers, Spaniels, and Hounds, are bred to
hunt ferret-size game, and they may find a ferret awfully tempting.
Supervise your ferret with these dogs with extreme caution.
 Some dogs are very territorial. An otherwise laid-back, ferret-friendly
pup may attack a ferret that ventures too close to her food, toys, or den.
Keep your dog’s stuff out of your ferret’s territory, and watch for signs
that your dog is getting possessive with other objects.
 A nursing dog can get extremely aggressive toward other animals when
she’s protecting her litter.
104
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

 Large or hyper dogs may inadvertently paw a ferret to death or injure
his spine in an attempt to engage in play.
 Some dogs don’t like little animals or young animals and are very freaky
around them. My dog Ara was great with cats but was unpredictable around
kittens.
 Some dogs do well with ferrets until a fuzzy nips or chases them. A ferret
is bound to nip and chase during play. If your dog can dish it out but
can’t take it, don’t allow her to play with a fuzzy at all.
 Some dogs just aren’t good with other animals, including ferrets.
Of course, many exceptions exist, which is why you’ll never know how an
interaction will go until you try. Some nursing dogs allow ferrets to snuggle in
with the rest of the litter. Some big dogs tiptoe gently around ferrets. Because
every animal is an individual, you must decide how to allow your fuzzy to
interact with your dog. Use common sense. If it feels or looks unsafe for your
ferret, it probably is.
The Fuzzy-Fido introduction
Introducing a fuzzy and a dog should be almost the same as introducing a
fuzzy and a cat. The main difference is that the process is slower. Just follow
these steps:
1. When your fuzzy is feeling settled in his new home (see the first sec-
tion of this chapter), allow your dog to roam freely around and investi-
gate your ferret’s cage — with fuzzy in the cage and with you present.
Allow this type of interaction to take place for several days. Especially if
you have a large dog, don’t allow your dog alone with the cage. I have a
friend who lost fuzzies to a large dog that tore apart the fuzzy cage in a
matter of 15 unsupervised minutes.
2. If the cage sniffing seems to be going well, take your ferret out and
hold him securely; let your dog and ferret sniff each other.
You’ll know things are going well if neither your dog nor you ferret is
lunging at the other, or your ferret isn’t cowering in the corner. If either
is showing aggression, stop the introductions and try again the next day.
Keep up the process until they become desensitized toward each other.
This may take a month or more and may never work out at all.
3. If the mutual smelling goes well, harness and leash your fuzzy and put
him down on the ground with the dog in the room.
Ideally, your dog’s tail should be wagging and he should smell the ferret.
Your ferret may or may not be interested in sniffing back. He may dance
with excitement or just ignore your dog. Watch your dog for warning
signs such as hackles up, baring teeth, or stiffened body. Every play inter-
action between your dog and ferret will be different from here on out and
should be supervised due to the unpredictable nature of both animals.
105
Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

No matter how well a dog and ferret seem to get along, never leave them
unsupervised. Be extra vigilant. Dogs can be funny critters, and I don’t mean
funny ha-ha. They’re quick, and you may not be able to rescue your ferret if
he needs help. 
Ferrets and other small animals
Ferrets are predatory by nature. Allowing them to play with other small
animals — such as rabbits, hamsters, birds, hedgehogs, guinea pigs, and
lizards — is, in essence, messing with the laws of nature. As I mention in
Chapter 8, most kibble-raised ferrets won’t even recognize smaller animals
as food. However, the quick movements made by small pets may trigger the
predatory reaction in your fuzzbutt. Even if a small pet stays perfectly still,
your ferret’s curiosity can take over, and, like a dog pawing during play, your
ferret may kill the small animal accidentally.
Yes, exceptions to this trend exist, but I wouldn’t want to risk the life of a
small pet just to see if my ferret falls into the exception category. As a general
guideline, keep your ferret separated from any animal his cousins may prey
on in the wild.
Preparing Your Child for the Ferret
Some adults think young, innocent kids automatically know what to do and
what not to do around animals. Not so. You need to teach your child about
interacting safely with animals. Although some youngsters may have more
common sense than their adult counterparts, an adult is still responsible for
keeping both the child and the pet safe. In the following sections, I let you
know what your kid needs to know before the introduction, and I take you
through the process of making the introduction.
Never allow any pet, ferret or otherwise, to interact unsupervised with a
baby, toddler, or incapacitated person. Doing so is incredibly irresponsible.
The human and the pet can get severely injured, particularly if the pet is a
small animal such as a ferret.
Pause the cartoons: What your child
should know beforehand
Children can activate the insanity button in even the calmest person or
ferret. Fuzzies already are strung out on excess energy, and kids can easily
manage to activate their overload switch. That’s a given, and something you
106
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

must deal with. Behavior aside, though, you must keep in mind that kids are
smaller than adults. They’re clumsier, and they have much higher pitched
voices. These factors alone can make an already nervous ferret even more
excited; when you combine the added hyperactivity a kid brings in, you can
have double trouble.
Your job as a responsible adult and ferret-owning human is to teach your
child what you know about ferrets in terms he or she will understand. When
you’re done explaining the following points to your kid, you can explain them
again to any of his or her young friends who may also want to interact with
your fuzzbutt:
 Many kids get frightened easily around animals, particularly when they
get nipped or scratched. Explain to your child that ferrets are very
active and playful.
 Stress to your child the importance of not running around or roughhous-
ing where ferrets are loose. Give reasons why so she’ll understand.
 Reinforce the importance of properly holding a fuzzy (see the section
“Hold me gently, please? [Why a question mark?]”). Children have a ten-
dency to squeeze things in order not to drop them. And they insist on
holding things and then rapidly and without warning change their minds
and let the objects or animals drop to the floor.
Insisting that your child always holds the ferret while sitting down is a
good idea. That way, even if your fuzzbutt squirms away, he won’t end
up plopping to the floor.
For safety reasons, always supervise children when they’re interacting with
your ferret until you feel confident that they know how to properly play.
Fuzzy, meet Junior: Making
the introduction
Kids can be quite unpredictable around and in their interactions with animals.
The introductions you make are very important in educating your child about
animal safety. It’s important to go slowly and explain things as you go along.
The first step in the introduction phase is to go over the rules I mention in
the previous section. When your child fully understands what you’re saying,
go over the following to help ease your ferret safely and comfortably into
your child’s life:
1. Because most children automatically shy away from being bitten or
scratched, make sure your child wears long pants and long sleeves to
prevent your ferret from clawing. This way, the child will find handling
the ferret easier and safer.
107
Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

2. Start off slowly by having your child sit on the floor in the same room
with the ferret. Allow the ferret to approach your child on his own
terms, but keep him from climbing on your child. This is a good time to
practice patience.
3. If the ferret seems relaxed around your child, and your child hasn’t
gone into hyper mode, pick up your ferret and demonstrate the
proper way to hold him. Point out his sharp claws and teeth and
explain why it’s important to properly hold the ferret.
4. With your child still sitting on the ground, place the ferret in the
child’s lap and allow the ferret to get used to being with a new
person. Encourage your child to gently pet the ferret.
5. If the meeting is going well and everyone is still calm, place the ferret
into your child’s arms, again showing her the proper way to hold the
ferret. Make sure you keep your hands just below the ferret in case your
child decides she no longer wants to hold him. If you feel comfortable
with your child’s comfort level, you can have her stand up and hold the
ferret.
6. If the you and your ferret both seem comfortable with how your child
is handling the situation, demonstrate how to put the ferret back
down. At this time, you also can show your child how to properly pick
up the ferret. Learning how to pick up your ferret and put him back
down is just as important as learning how to hold him. Remind your
child that she should never interact with the ferret without adult
supervision.
With these simple guidelines, you should be able to determine how responsi-
ble your child will be with a ferret, and how your ferret will do with a child.
Some kids and some ferrets take a little longer to get the hang of it. If this is
the case with your loved ones, go slow! Never force a child or a pet to inter-
act until both parties feel and act comfortable. Moving to the next step before
your child and pet have mastered the prior step may lead to injuries.
Fuzzy Meets Fuzzy: Adding Another
Ferret to Your Family
Introducing a new ferret to your other ferret pet(s) can be tricky business
(and, remember, should only be done after the proper quarantining process).
Like many other species of mammals, ferrets vie for top position. They do so
through play wrestling and biting. Some ferrets are natural leaders; others are
natural followers; and some would rather venture through life without ever
encountering another ferret. You may not know which type you’re bringing
home until you see him spring into action.
108
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Here are some bits of information to keep in mind when introducing your new
ferret to his new family:
 Kits (very young ferrets) are perfect squeaky toys for older ferrets,
although the kits rarely see it this way. Adult ferrets can be quite posses-
sive of youngsters. They may try to drag them around and stuff them in
hidey-holes while guarding aggressively against curious visitors.
 Newly introduced ferrets often display their frizzed tails for the first ten
minutes or so. This behavior is normal. Pay particular attention when
one ferret aggressively tackles another and performs an immediate alli-
gator roll, because this behavior can signal trouble. A dominant ferret
may take a lot longer to accept a new ferret and in some instances will
act particularly aggressive.
Sometimes, a frightened ferret screams and hisses as the more aggres-
sive ferret tries to engage in play. Ferrets play rough, but if one fuzzy
seems overly bullied or frightened, separate him and try introducing
again later.
 Ferrets that have been isolated for a long period of time may feel partic-
ularly frightened at the sight of another fuzzy.
 Although ferrets are capable of severely injuring — and even killing —
another ferret, it rarely happens. Of course, you should always end the
meeting if blood is drawn, and you should always have a spare cage for
the newcomer in case the introduction turns sour. Your quarantine cage
is perfect for this.
Some signs will almost immediately tell you that the new relationship proba-
bly won’t work out: Drawing blood, one ferret literally having the poop
scared out of him, and persistent screaming, to name a few. It may take only a
few minutes for a newcomer to be welcomed, or it may take hours, days, or
even months. Some ferrets just won’t, under any circumstances, coexist.
Most ferrets eventually learn to get along with other ferrets, though. If your
ferrets only display bottle-brush tails and keep coming back for more sniffs,
they should become best buds in no time.
That being said, you can do certain things to encourage a successful intro-
duction and relationship between fuzzies. I cover these actions in the sec-
tions that follow, as well as steps you can take to introduce multiple fuzzies.
Meeting on neutral ground
For your initial introduction, you should choose a ferret-proof room (see
Chapter 6) that your established ferret hasn’t yet explored. It should contain
ferret toys, tubes and climbing furniture, as well as food and water. It should
also contain secure nest boxes with small openings (see Chapter 5). Another
neutral place can be in your yard, with all the ferrets harnessed and leashed.
109
Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

When all parties are on site, place them together and watch cautiously to see
how they react and interact. If the introduction is a rough one, place them in
separate cages and try again later.
Messing with their sniffers
Ferrets have a tremendous sense of smell. They identify other ferrets and
objects based on the unique scents they give off. The scent of a new ferret
can be intimidating and provoke aggression or fear. So, you can take some
actions to get their noses used to each other:
 Because a lot of disagreements arise from one ferret not liking another’s
special smell, making them smell alike can help to curtail fuzzy tension.
Your ferrets are probably due for baths anyway, so break out the most
fragrant (and safe) shampoo you can find and give them baths (if you
want a more exotic smell, you can add a little vanilla extract to the bath;
see Chapter 9 for more on cleaning). The boys will be busy feeling
embarrassed at how girly they smell, and the girls will be busy walking
with their heads held high. An established ferret will notice a newcomer,
but everyone will smell pretty much the same at this point.
 You can clean all toys and bedding in your main fuzzy cage before lump-
ing them in together. Also, don’t forget to clean the cage and change the
litter boxes. These tasks give your new ferret ample opportunity to get
his scent in the cage at the same time as the others.
 You also can switch the cage bedding of the new ferret with the cage bed-
ding of the established fuzzy, and vice versa. This way, they have no
choice but to live with each other’s stink. They’ll either get used to each
other or resent the other even more. Usually, they get used to each other.
I use this tactic when introducing most animals to each other, from rab-
bits to foxes. Although it doesn’t always work, it has a high success rate.
Forcing a relationship
Some ferret relationships require a little extra help to get going, to the point
where it seems like you’re forcing the relationship. Hey, no one said the intro
would be easy! The following list presents a few more tips for helping your
tough guys get through the initial bad times:
 Carry the buggers around together. They may be so busy wondering
where they’re going that they’ll forget their hatred for each other —
even if just for a moment. Carry your ferrets everywhere you go in the
house. Hold them on your lap together. Make them watch television with
you — together!
110
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

 Stick the ferrets in a carrier together and take them to the vet for
their shots and checkups. Fear and anxiety have a bonding effect on
both humans and animals. Your fuzzies can share the moment and hate
you together.
 Allow them to share a tasty treat off the same spoon at the same time.
You also can allow them to enjoy the irresistible licks of Linatone from
the same bottle.
 Bathe them together in the same tub at the same time. They’ll share a
fear and anxiety similar to what they’ll experience at the vet. Plus, the
shared humiliation of the bath will lead to a bonding experience like no
other.
 Let them duke it out! It may be time to stop babying them. Let them
spend a few (3) days screeching, chasing, bullying, and fighting, but no
longer than that! Most of the time, ferrets work out their differences if
you let them. Use your common sense, but keep in mind that it usually
looks and sounds worse than it really is.
Easing your fuzzy into the business
Sometimes nothing you try seems to work, especially when you have one or
two ferrets that just seem unwilling to let a newcomer into the group. As frus-
trating as it may be, you should do everything you can to help ease the new
guy into the family. Because ferrets have a hierarchy amongst themselves, it’s
important to get to know everyone one by one, starting with the most sub-
missive ferret. The theory is that by the time the ferret has met the most
dominant ferrets, he’ll already have been accepted by the more submissive
ferrets and have become part of the family:
1. Introduce your new ferret to a safe, neutral room with plenty of
hiding spots (see the earlier section “Meeting on neutral ground”).
The first thing he’ll do is make his rounds to get to know the place and
the new scents. After he knows the territory, he’ll familiarize himself
with the toys and other items in the room. He’ll then dance about in play
and silliness, just like any healthy ferret should do. Before long, he’ll
become bored with his surroundings and look to you for more to do.
2. Introduce your most submissive and docile opposite-sex ferret into
the room. (If your new ferret is a boy, introduce a girl.)
Now that your new ferret’s attention is off the room, he can focus on the
newly introduced ferret. If all goes well, you should see a fair amount of
sniffing, some silly dancing, and some play about the room.
111
Chapter 7: Introducing Fuzzy to His New Family

3. Introduce your next most docile and submissive opposite-sex ferret
into the room.
Repeat this process with all ferrets of this characterization.
4. When you run out of opposite-sex ferrets to introduce, bring in the
most docile same-sex ferret.
Repeat this process as well.
5. What should remain are the unintroduced ferrets that are your typi-
cal aggressors.
The idea is that your new ferret will be assimilated into the group and
become more easily accepted by the more aggressive ferrets with the
blessing of the others.
Although gender introductions can be unpredictable, boy ferret meeting girl
ferret statistically has the best outcome. Boy ferret meeting boy ferret pro-
duces pretty good results, too. Girl ferret meeting girl ferret, on the other
hand, can be more of a challenge.
If any of the previous steps fail at any point along the way, you should stop
the introduction process and try again the next day. See the section “Messing
with their sniffers” and bathe each of them right before starting the process
again. Introduce Ferretone or another tasty treat when things start heating up
and have them share a spoon. Take things you’ve learned in this chapter and
incorporate them into this introduction process. Be creative. It may take sev-
eral rounds of introductions or combinations of techniques. When all is said
and done, there’s no guarantee any introduction technique will work for your
new ferret.
Heading Off Stranger Danger
Your new ferret may have several opportunities to encounter strangers when
he enters your family and home. A meeting may take place at the vet’s office
or in the park during playtime (with you attached at the end of the leash, of
course; see Chapter 5). It may be in your child’s classroom during a show-and-
tell or in your own home. You must realize that not everyone shares your
fuzzy enthusiasm; some people will be taken aback at the quick display of
curiosity shown by your ferret. Others may get annoyed at how bold your
ferret can be as he tries to steal their possessions and mow through their hair-
dos. The good news is that you’ll surely find people who are just like you and
me. These people will be tickled pink at your ferret’s charming personality.
112
Part II: Finding Your Ferret and Hanging Up the Welcome Hammock 

Some ferrets are natural social butterflies; others quiver with nervousness
when encountering new people or places. Use common sense; don’t risk a
stranger’s health or your fuzzy’s life if you already know that your ferret
reacts badly to change or strangers. That said, here are some suggestions for
dealing with strangers who come around your ferret:
 When allowing a stranger to touch your ferret for the first time, keep
your ferret’s head under control. Offer the stranger your ferret’s bottom
and back to pet in order to minimize any chance of biting.
 If you’re entertaining guests at your home or if your kids have friends
over, allow time for introductions; after the fuzzy curiosity has passed,
it’s best to keep your ferret caged. With so much else going on, super-
vising a roaming ferret becomes difficult. He can be mishandled or get
injured with all the feet moving about.
 If the stranger will become a frequent visitor to your ferret, give her a
brief education on the common behavior of ferrets and on the proper
way to handle them. I can’t stress the education factor enough. That,
along with common sense, has allowed me to show off my fuzzies hun-
dreds and hundreds of times with no tragedies to report.

errets are complicated critters with complicated
needs. This part deals with providing the basic neces-
sities: how to keep your ferret and his cage clean, how to
satisfy his nutritional requirements, how to provide the
activities he needs to stay healthy and happy, and how 
to go traveling — with or without him.
Most people can keep a ferret alive, but keeping him
healthy, happy, and sane is another matter. This part also
takes caring for your ferret a couple steps further by 
delving into issues such as alternative diets and environ-
mental enrichment for you and your fuzzy.

P
roviding a suitable diet is essential for your ferret’s good health, though
feeding your fuzzy properly is easier said than done. The keys to a good
diet are the proper amounts of
 Fat
 Meat-based protein
 Vitamins and minerals
So, what’s the problem? Finding this perfect diet can be difficult and challeng-
ing for even an experienced fuzzy human.
That’s why this chapter is extra-important. It covers the basic information
you need to know about water — how much water to give and how often to
give it — traditional diets, alternative diets, supplements, and treats. I also
discuss the ferret’s natural or evolutionary diet, a topic that in my opinion is
important to know about in order to understand your ferret’s nutritional
needs. I even explain how to switch a ferret’s diet if you find it necessary to
do so; I hope I can convince some of you to do just that!
Just as important is that your ferret’s diet be absent of, or have very minimal
amounts of,
 Fruits
 Vegetables
 Starches
 Sugars

118
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
The wrong foods can lead to obesity, food-related illnesses, and a shortened
life span. Just how big a part diet plays in terms of ferret diseases is still
being researched, but experts know that it’s big. We may all be surprised at
what will eventually be discovered.
Water, Water, Everywhere
No living thing can live without water, but not all water is equal when it
comes to hydrating your ferret. Some ferret owners prefer to use bottled or
distilled water. However, experts strongly argue that distilled water lacks
many important nutrients that pets need, so you may want to avoid distilled
water all together. Unless your tap water tests positive for high levels of
harmful chemicals, tap water should be sufficient to hydrate your ferret.
Make sure that your ferret’s water bottle is full at all times!
Ferrets as Diners
I think I can safely say that no one has come up with the perfect solution
when it comes to the question of what people should feed their domestic fer-
rets. There are so many factors that come into play, from owner preference to
food availability to ferret health. I can’t give you a single right answer. But I
do know a lot about ferrets’ dietary quirks and feeding needs. The following
list presents things all ferret owners should know about their ferrets; the
more you know about your ferret, the better you’ll be able to choose the right
diet for her:
 Ferrets are obligate carnivores, meaning they meet virtually all their
nutritional needs by eating meat-based (animal-based) foods. They must
eat meat!
 Ferrets are hypercarnivores, meaning their anatomy, physiology, and
behaviors are adapted to a strict carnivore lifestyle.
 Ferrets olfactory imprint on their foods, which means their food-odor
preferences are generally established by 6 months of age and finalized
by 8 to 12 months. At this point, the older they get, the less likely they’ll
be able to recognize the smell of a new food as being yummy.
 Ferrets aren’t built to digest fiber. If you were to take a peek inside
a ferret (not advised), you’d see that her large intestine is short and
tubular and that the ferret lacks a cecum. The cecum is a blind pouch
located at the junction where the small intestine ends and the large
intestine begins; this is the place where fiber is bacterially digested (sim-
ilar to the human appendix). Too much fiber in your ferret’s belly leads
to extra-squishy or mucousy poops.

 Ferrets may have a rapid GI transit time, depending on what food they
consume. Food may pass in as little as 3 to 4 hours, which leaves little
time to digest and absorb nutrients. In 6 hours, if fasted, the stomach
usually is completely emptied. For this reason, feeding high-quality
meat-based products and fat is even more important.
 Ferrets can’t digest milk as adults because of low levels of lactase.
 Ferrets, because they’re carnivores, have very simple gut flora (bacteria).
Unlike in herbivores, fermentation isn’t needed to extract the nutrients
during the digestive process. Digestive additives such as Lactobacillus,
found in yogurt, aren’t important and won’t help a ferret digest food.
 The ferret’s teeth are designed for tearing and cutting, not for chewing.
This list is just the beginning. This chapter is full of dietary information that
should help you sort out the questions in your head!
Feeding the Traditional Commercial Diet
Traditional commercial diet formulas for ferrets have improved over the past
decades as people have gained more knowledge and understanding of the
ferret. But when it comes to dietary needs, your ferret is still no different
from her polecat cousins: Her food should contain taurine (which helps keep
her eyes and heart healthy) and be composed of between 15 and 20 percent
fat and no less than 32 to 40 percent meat-based protein. When it comes to
kibble and wet food, ferret owners have many options:
 The pet industry has come out with several foods formulated just for
ferrets. The majority of these commercial diet foods meet the
protein/fat-level requirements, and some are considered among the best
commercially available food choices for your ferret.
 Some high-quality dry kitten foods have the necessary taurine, fat, and
protein contents, but many don’t. Before you make dry kitten food a
staple of your ferret’s diet, make sure the brand you choose has the
nutritional content your ferret needs.
 Dog food isn’t a source of proper nutrition for your ferret. It’s usually too
low in protein and too high in grains and veggies. It also doesn’t contain
the taurine additive that your ferret needs for healthy eyes and heart. As
an infrequent treat, though, dog food is fine.
Don’t expect a pet shop clerk to know what’s best for your ferret. Many are
fairly educated about the animals they sell, but I’ve overheard one or two telling
new ferret owners to feed canned dog food or only hamburger meat. I even
heard one clerk tell a customer that ferrets are herbivores (plant eaters). Instead,
read through the information in the following sections about what type of com-
mercial diet to feed your ferret. In these sections, I discuss what wet and dry
119
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

foods are and the pros and cons of feeding them to your ferret. I also talk about
setting up a feeding schedule and what to do if you want to change from one
diet to another. After you know the facts, you can get with your vet to go over
your options.
Wet or dry food?
Some people like to stick with a dry food for their ferrets, and others prefer to
feed their fuzzies moist food. Some people alternate between the diets, and
some savvy ferret owners mix the dry and moist foods. I personally try to give
my ferrets as much variety as possible. The following sections give you some
things to think about when deciding what type of food is right for your furball.
Commercial dry (kibble)
Kibble is widely available, hygienically safe, economical, and convenient,
making it the most popular dietary choice among ferret owners. Many dry
kibble options are available. They come in the form of kitten or ferret food.
Some are at the top of my list, and others would go right into my garbage can.
Some “nutritionally complete” ferret diets are available, but no matter what,
you need to choose only a high-quality ferret or kitten kibble for your furball.
120
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
Dissecting pet food labels
Pet food labels, even those from reputable man-
ufacturers, can be and often are misleading.
Unless the label says all the protein is from meat,
you can be sure it isn’t. The protein can come
from other sources thrown into the recipe. The
hair in a hairball is close to 100 percent protein.
Fecal matter (trace amounts are allowed in by-
products) also is made up of protein. Ick! So even
if your ferret’s food is 30 percent protein, how
much of it actually comes from meat? Even if meat
is listed as the top ingredient, that doesn’t mean
the meat is where all the protein comes from.
Most pet foods have meat or chicken by-products
listed as a first ingredient. What the heck are
meat and chicken by-products, anyway? Hold
onto your lunch. By-products are leftover gunky
animal bits that aren’t fit for human consumption.
They don’t even qualify to be stuffed into a hot dog
casing (that’s really bad). By-products include
such yummies as heads (chicken), skin, feet,
blood, guts, beaks, tendons, stomach contents,
discarded organs, and fecal matter (trace
amounts). Once in a while, by-products may
include bits of less-than-fresh meat. The protein
from by-products may not be easily digested by
your pet ferret. The key is the quality and whole-
someness of the by-products.
Consumers don’t even know why many additives
are thrown into the pet food. Some say “to pre-
serve freshness.” Sure. Can you imagine? And did
they remember to add all those essential vitamins,
amino acids, and minerals that ferrets evolved
eating? Some manufacturers may try their best to
make up for it in some way, but how do we really
know the job was accomplished? And ponder
this: If a food was perfect, as each ad campaign
suggests, why do the same manufacturers con-
tinuously release “new and improved” versions?
This is evidence that the diet was NOT as com-
plete as advertising suggested.

If you want to feed your ferret kibble, keep this in mind: Ideally, the first three
ingredients should be meat products, and the kibble should contain no corn.
The majority of kibble is poultry-based. Avoid products that contain dried
bits of fruits or vegetables, which ferrets can’t digest.
Ferrets can’t chew kibble, so they swallow it in chunks; thus, it may not be
digested properly, especially if the ferret has limited access to water. Ferrets
must first hydrate kibble (guaranteed to less than 10 percent moisture)
before proper digestion. And contrary to popular belief, dry kibble doesn’t
significantly help wear down the tartar buildup on a fuzzy’s teeth. Hard
kibble fed as a sole diet does cause tooth wear because it’s very abrasive.
Sprinkle a few drops of water or chicken broth over the hard food and
microwave it briefly to help soften it up a little without making it the consis-
tency of canned food. This minimizes damage to the teeth and improves
digestibility.
This all sounds well and good, right? But dry kibble isn’t all good for all fer-
rets. The following list outlines some cons of feeding your ferret kibble:
 Kibble isn’t mentally stimulating and is monotonous in taste.
 The heat and processing of the kibble may make some of the protein less
digestible.
Kibble is an extruded diet. The ingredients are finely ground into a dough
and then pushed or drawn through a “kibble-shaped” tube with heat and
pressure. The dough is then cut and dried.
 Starches/carbohydrates are used in the formation of kibble to hold 
the shape. Most kibbles have around 20 to 30 percent digestible 
carbohydrates.
 The higher than needed levels of carbs in kibble may contribute to dis-
eases such as insulinoma (see Chapter 16), gastroenteritis, and bladder
stones.
Commercial canned
Canned pet food is widely available, hygienically safe, economical, and conve-
nient, and is therefore another popular choice among ferret owners. When
looking for a canned food, you should stick with a high-quality feline or ferret
food. The main ingredients should be meat products, and the food should
contain no additional grains or sweeteners.
Canned ferret food has some benefits that you should consider when making
the diet decision:
 Canned foods are mentally stimulating.
 Because many meat proteins are available, the tastes in canned foods
are varied.
 Canned foods are low in carbs and high in fat and protein.
121
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

Of course, canned foods have their cons, too:
 High-quality canned feline or ferret food is easier on the teeth in terms of
wear, but it may lead to faster tartar buildup.
 Canned food lacks the nutrient density to be a ferret’s sole food. Because
it is about 70 percent water, ferrets need to eat a larger volume of canned
food to get the same calories provided by dry food, which has only about
a 1-percent moisture content. Ferrets’ tummies are small, so they may not
be able to get all their nutrient needs from canned food only.
Depending on the brand, it’s rare that a canned food would be a nutritionally
better food than dry kibble. It’s also slightly more expensive than kibble and
can cause stinkier poops. Canned food shouldn’t be the only food in the
ferret’s diet, but it would make an excellent addition to any main course,
especially when served alongside kibble.
Setting a feeding schedule
Ferret owners influence how often their ferrets need to eat, because ferrets
adapt their eating cycles to what and when they’re being fed. For example, if
you’re feeding your ferret a kibble that’s high in carbs, blood/sugar fluctuations
can drive your ferret to eat more often — perhaps as often as every 4 to 5
hours. An even poorer diet could drive her to eat every 3 to 4 hours. However,
if you’re feeding a diet that’s high in fat and meat-based protein, you’ll leave
your ferret satisfied for much longer — perhaps as long as 8 to 10 hours.
Some people think that leaving food out all the time leads to ferret obesity.
They must be thinking of us humans! Normally, ferrets aren’t gluttons and
consume only the amount of fat needed to get the energy to terrorize their
households in their normal capacity. This is called eating to meet caloric need,
which is possible only when the ferret is eating a nutritionally complete food.
If the ferret’s diet is of nutritionally poor quality, your fuzzy will develop a
nutritional deficit and will instinctively eat more to make up for it. This is
called eating to meet nutritional need. If the poor diet also happens to be
loaded with carbs (calorie dense), eating it can result in an obese ferret.
If you think your ferret is getting chunky, take her to the vet to rule out an
enlarged spleen or fluid in her abdominal cavity. Enlarged spleens are
common causes of rapid weight gain.
Some ferrets get slightly wider with age, and some get wider in the winter. In
general, obesity is rarely a serious problem in ferrets — especially if their
diets are balanced.
122
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Changing kibble diets
There are many reasons for needing or wanting to change your ferret’s kibble
diet. It can be a medical necessity. The food you’re currently feeding may be
discontinued. Or you may find something better out there for her. But it may
be difficult to convince your ferret that she needs to change to the new type
of food — especially if the fuzzy has been fed a different or improper diet
before coming into your care. If this is the case, you need to switch the ferret
over to the good stuff, despite any protest she may display. I’ve had some fer-
rets that would eat any type of cat, kitten, or ferret food, no matter what. On
the other hand, I’ve had some that refused all food until I could figure out
exactly what they’d been eating before coming into my care. This is a case of
extreme olfactory imprinting (see the earlier section “Ferrets as Diners”).
The best way to switch your ferret’s food is to mix her previous food with the
new food of choice. Start off by adding just a small amount of the new food to
the old. It’s important not to switch completely to the new food immediately.
Such a drastic change can lead to an upset tummy, diarrhea, and a generally
crabby ferret. Gradually increase the amount of new food you include and
decrease the amount of old food; do so over the course of 10 to 14 days. This
process usually works well and gives your fuzzy’s system a chance to get
used to the change.
If your ferret eats around the new food and devours the old, give her time
and don’t give up. The switch may take several days or even as long as sev-
eral months, so patience and persistence are positive virtues. The health of
your baby could depend on it.
If you own multiple ferrets and house them in the same cage, telling whether
a ferret has taken to her new food can be difficult, because the ferrets eat
from the same bowl. As the food level is quickly depleted, you may be
unaware that your ferret is slowly starving, which can be extremely danger-
ous. Watch for any significant weight changes in all your fuzzies, particularly
the newcomers. In fact, I recommend that you house a new ferret separately
until you know for sure that she’s eating what the rest of the gang is eating.
This practice gives you the opportunity to monitor her food intake closely
and prevent a possible slow starvation.
Serving Up an Alternative Diet
People have fed their ferrets man-made foods — mostly out of convenience
or lack of anything else good to feed — since World War II. Recently, the
ferret world has seen a growing movement to switch to more natural diets. A
123
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

natural diet consists of feeding, among other things, meats, organs, and
bones. Some people believe the only way to true pet health is to feed a diet
that the animal evolved eating, and kibble certainly wasn’t around 2,500
years ago, much less a century ago.
The following list presents what proponents of natural and evolutionary diets
believe the benefits are:
 A natural or evolutionary diet ensures that your ferret is getting her
essential nutrients. For example, those essential amino acids that the
ferret can’t produce herself are commonly found in the foods her wild
relatives eat: rabbits, mice, rats, birds, frogs, lizards, and squirrels.
Calcium is another example: Many man-made cat, kitten, or ferret foods
lack quality bone meal, so ferrets are losing out on needed calcium.
 A healthy ferret on a varied and natural diet doesn’t need to have food
available at all times. The ferret’s wild relatives eat only once or twice a
day, sometimes even missing days when food is scarce.
 Many people who feed their fuzzies a more natural diet believe that the
variation of food consistency (bone, skin, meat, and so on) helps to flush
out the intestinal tract, causing the ferret to be less prone to hairballs
and other obstructions. The diet also helps to even out nutrient needs
that are currently unknown.
 The design of the ferret’s jaw and teeth leaves her with limited chewing
capability. Her teeth were designed for cutting meat and bone, but not
all the time — at least not up to ten meals per day. Kibble can be as hard
as or harder than bone, and its abrasiveness leads to wear on the teeth.
A natural diet generally is easier on the teeth.
The following sections explain what I call a natural diet (raw or freeze-dried
raw) and an evolutionary diet (small, whole prey). But first, you need to
understand the polecat a little better. And you’ll also learn about bones as
part of the alternative diet. Finally, I explore the different ways you can feed
the natural or evolutionary diet to your ferret.
Most mainstream veterinarians are adamantly opposed to feeding raw meat
diets, whether they’re homemade or commercially prepared, and list many
valid reasons why. Other vets and many holistic vets swear by the raw diet
and give their valid reasons why as well. And each group refutes the other’s
reasons. Both sides sound right and reasonable. The only thing they agree on
is that care and diligence are needed in handling raw food.
Although it’s unknown exactly how the nutrient composition will be changed,
it’s possible to cook the diet to eliminate the risk of passing along any bacte-
ria or parasites to your ferret. You can braise, steam, or microwave the food.
This is also a good way to get your ferret switched over to the raw diet if this
is what you choose to feed. Offer the food completely cooked or even slightly
124
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

cooked to help get your ferret’s system used to the change. Gradually mix in
raw food with the cooked before switching completely to raw. See the section
“Exploring the alternative way of feeding” for more advice on diet conversion.
Getting to know the wild polecat’s diet
If I were to undertake the task of designing the perfect man-made ferret food,
the first thing I would do is research. I would want to know what animal(s)
was the ferret’s closest relative and what it naturally thrived on in the wild.
Ferrets are descended from wild polecats, and experts know that both ferrets
and polecats are obligate carnivores (see the section “Ferrets as Diners”). So,
what do polecats prey on and eat in the wild? Mice, rats, rabbits, frogs, other
amphibians, invertebrates, voles, small snakes, birds, eggs, and even some fish.
Polecats often eat the entire carcass of smaller prey, from the organs to the
bones, sometimes leaving the intestinal tract by the wayside. They also con-
sume the fur of smaller prey and the downy part of birds as they eat the bodies.
This natural diet is extremely low in carbohydrates. Most prey-animal carbohy-
drates originate from the animals’ glycogen and blood sugar, with some possibly
coming from the intestinal tracts of the animals. The diet also is high in meat-
based protein and low in fiber. Additionally, this type of diet typically doesn’t
lead to dental disease. Admittedly, some polecats do get the disease, but the
rate in polecats is much lower. The various textures of natural prey foods actu-
ally serve to massage the ferret’s gums and help wipe the teeth clean.
Ferrets, if given the opportunity at a young age, would follow in their ances-
tors’ dietary footsteps. Just for kicks, compare the evolutionary ingredients to
the current list of ingredients found in your ferret’s kibble. Nowhere in the
polecat’s diet would you find corn grits, corn meal, wheat, soy flour, rice, raisin
puree, banana juice, cane molasses, corn sugar, dried potato products . . .
well, you get the idea. Those are just some of the ingredients you may find in
ferret kibble. What are food manufacturers thinking when they formulate our
ferrets’ food? They certainly aren’t thinking of the evolutionary dietary needs
of the ferret. (For more on an evolutionary diet, see the section that focuses
on the topic later in this chapter.)
Bellying up to a bone-filled diet
Bones contain an incredible amount of good stuff, with calcium being the
most obvious nutritional content. Bone marrow itself is made up of tissues
rich in protein and fat. Bone and marrow contain high amounts of fatty acids,
fats, iron, and other vitamins essential to the health of carnivores. Most of
this good stuff comes from the ends of the bones, which are softer and easily
bitten, chewed, and swallowed. The placement of the good stuff is beneficial,
because the ends are the parts ferrets are most interested in. They usually
leave the rest if they can find something else to eat.
125

Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
BARF at home
Bones and Raw Food
Biologically Appropriate Raw Food
Feeding your ferret, or any pet, BARF is based
on the belief that you can mimic its evolutionary
diet by combining whole, raw, natural foods.
The BARF diet, which includes meats, bones,
non-meats, and numerous supplements, was
formulated by Dr. Ian Billinghurst, who claimed
that man-made kibble doesn’t allow domestic
animals to thrive like their wild ancestors do on
a raw diet.
Proponents believe BARF
 Can lengthen lifespan
 Can prevent and even reverse illnesses/dis-
eases in pets
 Improves the immune system
 Improves pets’ performance
 Improves coat and body odor
 Eliminates the need for dental cleanings
 Is more balanced than commercial kibbles
Many people “BARF” their pets on their own,
using recipes they’ve gotten off the Internet or
simply ones they’ve concocted themselves. This
isn’t always safe. A homemade diet can be the
best or the worst food you can feed your ferret!
It’s very difficult to get the right formula down;
you could make your ferret sick by not having
the right amount of this, that, or the other thing.
Says veterinarian Susan Brown, “100% home-
made diets — either raw, cooked, or a combi-
nation thereof — have been used successfully
in some cases with individual animals. However,
this requires real diligence to detail and having
enough variety in the diet to cover all of the
needs of the ferret, including trace vitamins and
minerals. In addition, the owner has to prevent
over-supplementation of various vitamins and
minerals, because excessive amounts of some
substances can be as great a health risk as not
enough of these same substances. Currently
there are quite a few quality diet choices for the
small carnivore, and it is my recommendation
that a ferret’s diet should have a majority of its
substance based on a commercial diet, whether
it is a commercial raw, kibble, freeze-dried, or
canned diet, or even better a combination of at
least two of these forms.”
Opponents of BARF believe
 The risk of transmitting bacteria and para-
sites to people and pets far outweighs the
pros of feeding BARF. E.coli and salmonella
are particularly of concern.
 The diet poses a particular risk to pet
owners who formulate and mix the diets,
especially people who are young, elderly, or
immuno-compromised.
 The diet is more often than not nutritionally
unsound and inconsistent.
 The use of whole bones can cause intesti-
nal obstructions/perforations, dental frac-
tures, and gastroenteritis.
If you like the idea of BARF, there are several
commercially made raw and freeze-dried ferret
diets available, which I’ll talk about later. They
may be easier and more convenient to feed, as
well as closer to the nutritional balance you’re
looking for. I also talk more about the contro-
versy of feeding raw meat.

Fact is, bones are wonderful sources of natural nutrition. If you think your
ferret would benefit from the calcium and other nutrients in bones, you
should try adding them to her diet.
Can feeding bones to your ferret cause harm? Certainly. On rare occasions, a
splinter may cut the esophagus, causing internal bleeding. A bone fragment
can even puncture the intestinal tract or stomach. But in my experience,
these scenarios happen less frequently than a ferret choking on commercial
food. Plus, the middle piece of a bone is the part that would most likely cause
damage, and most ferrets eat off the ends of the bones only, leaving the mid-
dles for the garbage can.
If you’re thinking of including bones in your ferret’s diet, try these suggestions:
 Start off with something you know is too big to swallow and too hard to
splinter, like a cooked ham bone or soup bone. The more marrow
included, the better. You can see for yourself that this type of bone is too
hard to bite in pieces and too big to be swallowed. Your fuzzy still gets
the benefit of the marrow and a bonus toy for later.
 Some people feed their ferrets raw bones, but I suggest briefly boiling
the bones first. Don’t bake or microwave the bones, because you’ll dry
them out and make them splinter. Besides softening the bone a little,
boiling eliminates any bacteria.
 Try feeding only the softer ends of long bones or backbones. People
often offer boiled chicken or turkey bones.

Bob’s Bone Broth
Check out this recipe if you want to get the good
stuff out of the bone and incorporate it into your
ferret’s diet (for more recipes, see Chapter 25):
1. Place chicken bones on a cutting board.
Cover with plastic wrap and then cover with
a towel. Using a mallet, smash the bones
into small pieces.
2. Remove the towel and plastic and scrape
the bone mash into a cooking pot.
3. Add enough water to boil and simmer for
about an hour.
4. Strain the bone fragments and throw them
away.
5. You can now use the broth as a soup, to mix
with dry food, or as a base for boiling pieces
of chicken.

If you’re worried about contamination, boil the bones. If you’re worried about
pokey parts, smash them down. You don’t have to eliminate bones from a
ferret’s diet simply because of worry.
Choosing commercial raw or 
freeze-dried raw diets
Several pet food companies have developed commercially prepared raw or
freeze-dried raw diets for ferrets or felines. These types of diets can be a
great substitute for making the natural raw diet yourself. They’re a little more
expensive, but they’re certainly more convenient and are likely to be more
nutritionally complete than homemade natural diets.
The pros of this type of natural diet include the following:
 Some formulas are closer to the ferret’s evolutionary diet, in terms of
composition, than commercial canned food or kibble.
 The diet is meat- and fat-based and is low on carbs.
 Many of the nutrients are retained because this diet is unprocessed.
 The diet may lessen the signs of and even prevent some GI diseases.
 The diet is easy to feed, because the food usually comes in little medallions
or freeze-dried chunks, which can be fed dry or reconstituted with water.
 A wide variety of meat proteins are available; and the tastes are varied,
making it more mentally stimulating.
 Your ferret will have smaller and less frequent poops, because she’ll
digest more of the food.
 You’ll need to feed your ferret less frequently because of the natural
nature of the diet.
The commercial raw or freeze-dried raw diet can be fed alone, but would also
make an excellent addition to a kibble diet, or you can alternate this type of
diet with kibble.
The diet, however, does have its cons, which include the following:
 Composition can vary greatly from diet to diet.
 The diet is hygienically questionable for you; you must use excellent
hygiene practices if you apply the diet.
 You risk the transmission of parasites or bacteria to ferrets through the
feeding of raw meat.
 It may or may not be nutritionally balanced.

Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly
E. coli and salmonella
Both E. coli and salmonella are opportunistic
little buggers that can live in the ferret’s
intestines without causing upset. Clinical signs
range from mild gastroenteritis to more dis-
concerting signs such as tarry/bloody stools,
anorexia, pale mucous membranes, severe
dehydration, and even death. At minimum, treat-
ment includes the appropriate antibiotics and
fluid therapy. But the questions still left unan-
swered are how often are ferrets truly infected
with debilitating E. coli or salmonella infections?
Let me first say people will always perceive
some sort of risk when feeding food, especially
raw. However, perceived risk is what you think
the risk is regardless of what the actual risk is.
Because of perceived risk, raw foods are under
continuous scrutiny, which is rarely given to
commercial foods.
Your immune system supplies the soldiers that
guard the body against microbial intruders,
such as the dreaded salmonella and E. coli. It’s
an adaptive system, so if you’ve never encoun-
tered an organism, you can get really sick and
even die if suddenly exposed.
The same process is true when it comes to sal-
monella and E. coli. As strict carnivores, pole-
cats come into contact with both organisms on
a frequent basis. As a result, they have a natural
immunity that helps protect them. This immunity
could be genetic or acquired or a combination
of both. However, some studies show that the
immune system has to be “taught” to recognize
the good from the bad. That’s the basis of inoc-
ulations; you use a weakened, dead, or harm-
less variant to teach the immune system how to
fight the living and dangerous invader.
There is no doubt that commercial raw foods
are potentially contaminated with dozens of
species of bacteria, any of which could result in
disease or infection to the handler or consumer.
This danger is not limited to raw meats, poultry,
or eggs, but all raw foods, including raw veg-
etables and fruit. Salmonella and E. coli are the
most commonly mentioned bacteria when dis-
cussing raw diets, but little empirical evidence
exists to equate the perceived risk of infection
to the actual risk. Arguments that the presence
of salmonella in ferret feces proves it’s a danger
cannot be properly assessed without a baseline
for comparison. A lot of emphasis is made of the
risks of salmonella and E. coli, whatever they
are, but little or no research has been done in
ferrets that show —one way or another — that
the presence of the bacteria constitutes an
actual threat to the ferret or healthy individuals
within their environment.
The solution to feeding is a common sense
approach to the problem. If you want to feed a
kibble diet, then empty the dish of uneaten food
each day, wash the dish in hot soapy water, and
let it sit in the sun (or under a UV lamp) for an
hour. Just because kibble is dry, it doesn’t mean
it can’t be contaminated with salmonella and
E. coli.
Likewise, if you want to feed a raw diet, keep in
mind that you cannot predict if any food will be
contaminated or not. If you’re still uncomfort-
able feeding raw meat, it can be briefly seared
with a propane torch (or on a hot barbeque) to
kill surface bacteria without seriously harming
interior nutrients. Or, it can be immersed in food-
grade hydrogen peroxide to kill surface bacteria
(many internet stores carry the product).
Perhaps the best way to kill as many bacteria as
possible is to immerse the food in boiling water
for a minute or so; again, to kill surface bacte-
ria. Both searing and boiling will cook the con-
taminated surfaces, killing the bacteria, but
allow the relatively sterile interiors to remain
mostly uncooked, leaving important nutrients
intact.

This diet isn’t recommended for use in homes with people who are immuno-
compromised. You can cook this food by braising, microwaving, or steaming
to make it safe. Chances are, you’ll change the nutrient composition to some
degree with cooking, but it isn’t known to what degree.
The evolutionary diet: Feeding your 
pet small animals or insects
The evolutionary diet is simple. Essentially, you feed your ferret what she
evolved eating. The polecat’s diet is varied and includes, among other things,
small mammals (rabbits, mature mice, weanling and older rats, and chicks),
insects, amphibians, eggs, carrion invertebrates, and fish, with perhaps a tiny
amount of fresh fruit to “season” the diet (fruit is only seasonally available).
The evolutionary diet is about offering freedom of choice and variety, and
promoting the consumption of many different natural foods. Mimicking the
evolutionary diet in captivity can be quite a challenge, though. Makers or for-
mulators of BARF (bones and raw food/biologically appropriate raw food)
and raw/freeze-dried raw diets claim to do it. But nothing can beat the real
thing.
Because the ferret can consume an evolutionary diet, grow, survive, and suc-
cessfully reproduce, the diet actually meets AAFCO (Association of American
Feed Control Officials) requirements, the same as commercial kibble. (An
important implication of the AAFCO requirements is that all modern diets
attempt to match the evolutionary diet, making it the standard.) Although the
evolutionary diet hasn’t been studied in detail, its obvious success implies
that it meets all the polecat’s nutritional requirements, known or unknown.
Tables 8-1 and 8-2 cover the nutritional content in many common types of

Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly
Meat matters
Many people argue that cooked meat (or eggs)
is the ideal choice for diet. Others fight diligently
to prove that raw is the best. Still others say, “If
you must feed meat, feed it in the form of human
baby food.” And, of course, when discussing
meat, there’s always the issue of live or dead
and the pros and cons of doing either. Well done
or rare?
It’s common knowledge that cooking meat kills
off any harmful bacteria that may cause illness
to the unfortunate diner. Some people suggest
that you rinse raw meat in food-grade hydrogen
peroxide to make it safe for pets. If you’re com-
fortable with those answers, stick with them.
However, I don’t see little barbecue pits scat-
tered throughout the forests, nor do I see dead
coyotes, foxes, hawks, or other predators on the
sides of the roads (unless they’re car casual-
ties). Carnivores eat raw meat. That’s a fact of
life.
If you’re still unsure about raw meat, cut off the
outside layer of the meat. The inside meat is
generally sterile and safe. Make sure that the
meat is fresh. I have fed live, fresh-killed, and
thawed frozen meat to a number of animals over
the years and have never had an incident of ill-
ness resulting from raw meat. Many Europeans
continue to feed their ferrets mostly rabbit, and
they’re among the biggest, healthiest, and most
muscular ferrets around.
Although clean raw meat (okay, cooked meat,
too) is a wonderful food for ferrets, it can’t be
the sole food. Wild polecats eat the whole
animal — bones, organs, and all. Domestic fer-
rets need all the good nutrients that come from
the rest of the prey animal, not just the muscle
meat. They also need some tooth resistance,
such as tendons, to help clean their teeth. The
same goes for fish as a food source. It’s good,
but it shouldn’t be the only food source.
Also, freezing may kill off some bacteria but
doesn’t generally kill off everything. And even if
meat is cooked, post-cooking handling can seri-
ously contaminate the food before it’s even
poured into your ferret’s bowl. No feeding
regime is without risk.

Pros (and procedures) of the evolutionary diet
Pros of feeding your ferret the evolutionary diet (small whole prey) include
the following:
 It’s the most nutritionally complete diet available.
 The ferret retains all the nutrients.
 The diet is mentally and behaviorally stimulating.
 It may lessen the signs of and even prevent some GI diseases.
 Produces smaller and less-frequent stools because of its high digestibility.
 You don’t need to feed your ferret as frequently.
This whole idea of feeding your ferret an evolutionary diet can be confusing
in the beginning — especially when you’re trying to figure out this business
of prey. What is it, where do you get it, and what precautions do you take?
Start small — give mice, feeder goldfish, chicks, mealworms, or crickets (for
the daring) — and you may find that these food items work out just fine for
your ferret. Or you may decide to upgrade to other items such as rats, small
rabbits, small frogs, or small lizards. Whatever you decide or whatever your
ferret likes, you can find prey animals at reptile supply stores or even most
pet shops. Nowadays, you can even choose from hundreds of online sources
to have your fresh, frozen prey and live insects shipped to your doorstep.
For people who want to feed a whole animal to a carnivore, the question is
always, “Should a carnivore be fed a live or dead animal?” Mostly, this is a
choice that addresses the owner’s personal beliefs. However, it may be illegal
to feed a live animal to another animal where you live.
132
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

My decision to feed pre-killed versus live rests on what type of carnivore I’m
feeding and the experience of the predator. I feed my ferrets fresh-killed prey.
Polecats, ferrets included, are by nature efficient and quick predators that
normally kill with a lightning-fast bite to the back of the neck. But most
domesticated ferrets don’t recognize small animals as food. Some are quick
to kill; others play with the food until it happens to die. And some ferrets
could care less and lazily watch a potential snack waltz on by. For a ferret
eating a more natural diet, I see no reason to offer live food unless she’s a
quick predator. That’s my opinion. I don’t like to see the prey animal suffer
anymore than it has to.
The majority of animal supply stores will give you a choice of purchasing most
prey items live, frozen, or fresh-killed. It’s a personal choice; go with whatever
you’re most comfortable with and what your skills are. However, I caution you
to never feed a live rat to your ferret for the same reason I never feed live rats to
my snakes: A rat can inflict serious wounds during a scuffle with even an
excellent predator. Also, you should feed chicks sparingly. Although they’re
good for treats here and there, chicks are very low in calcium.
Research the source of your prey foods! If the prey isn’t healthy, it isn’t
healthy for your ferret. Does the supply store feed the prey quality foods? Are
the animals free of parasites, bacteria, and nutritional diseases? How does
the company kill the prey before shipping? How does it pack the prey for
shipping? Does it offer guarantees? How long has it been in business?
133
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly
Bob Church on free choice feeding
“The advantage of allowing the ferret free
choice is that they will naturally select those
foods that ‘fill the nutritional gaps.’ The hypoth-
esis is that animals, if given free choice, will nat-
urally select foods that meet their caloric and
nutritional needs. Feeding this type of diet is
simpler than it first appears. For example, I use
two cafeteria trays, each with 8 small bowls, to
feed my ferrets. One bowl may have crickets,
another with large mealworms, another with
chopped beef or pork, one with night crawlers,
one with chopped up boiled egg, another with
goldfish — you get the idea. About half of the
bowls are filled with frozen mice. Once or twice
a month, a SMALL amount of fresh finely
minced fruit is offered. All feed animals were
purchased after humane killing, or (in the case
of the worms and insects) frozen to preserve
nutrients and to eliminate escape. To lower the
risk of binge eating of extremely favored items,
they are given by hand. To reduce risk of food
caching, the dishes are removed with all
remaining food after about an hour. Leftover
foods such as insects or frozen animals can be
refrigerated and reused. With experience, it is
an easy task to judge how much or little food is
appropriate to offer. Every few days, all leftover
or thawed food is dumped into a blender and
turned into a ‘prey shake’ that can be frozen for
future use as a food supplement, treat, or food
base for sick ferrets. I have very little waste, no
spoilage of cached foods, and no sick ferrets.”

Cons of the evolutionary diet
The following list presents some cons of feeding the evolutionary diet (small
whole prey):
 The practice is distasteful to some ferret owners.
 The diet can be expensive (although you can be economical and raise
your own mice or rats for food).
 Some sources of animals aren’t nutritional — they aren’t free of para-
sites, bacterial infections, and nutritional disease. This is becoming less
of a problem, however, because of active reptile-owning enthusiasts
needing many of the same foods.
With so many feed-supply options available to you, you shouldn’t offer your
ferret an animal that’s come from the wild. In fact, you may do way more
harm than good. Many wild animals harbor parasites and bacteria that can
be passed on to your ferret. Another thing to consider is poison/pesticides.
Speaking from personal experience, I know of someone who lost a ferret
134
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
An aggressive myth
Many people believe that feeding live animals
(and some even believe raw meat) makes your
ferret more aggressive. This simply isn’t true.
Domestic doesn’t mean unnatural. It only means
tame, made fit for domestic life, adapted or bred
to live with and be of use to man. Humans are
domestic. Does that mean we can’t cater to our
primal urges once in a while?
Take a good look at the average housecat.
Some of these sweet, purring kitties can be
killing machines, responsible for millions of
wildlife deaths each year. While they can be
quick killers, they more often than not kill slowly,
often playing and toying with the victim before
death. And yet, our housecats remain dear to
our hearts, sharing our pillows at night and
claiming us as their possessions in the morning
by rubbing up against our legs. Why would a
ferret be any different?
Many “reports” of aggression are usually easily
explained with a bit of investigation. Many of the
reports resulted from ratters or rabbiters who
starved their ferrets to increase their hunter
instincts. Many of these animals would have
aggressively defended their meals, giving the
illusion the meat made them aggressive. Also,
meat was a favored food in those days of the
milk and bread diet, making it something to
defend. Ferrets were supposed to chase rabbits
from the burrow, and when a rabbit was caught
by a ferret, it was forcibly removed, increasing
aggression.
All ferrets have a natural predatory instinct. It
shows in the way they play with their toys as well
as in how they interact with each other. Feeding
your ferret what she would naturally eat in the
wild won’t unleash some fantasy wild beast
inside. It only gives her an opportunity to experi-
ence and benefit from something more natural
than what she’s used to. In the end, she’ll be the
same lovable character, except maybe a little
happier, healthier, and more energetic.

when a wild mouse got into the cage. The ferret ate the mouse; unfortunately,
the mouse had just eaten a load of poison that had been left out in the
garage. Wild animals can pick up pesticides on the grass, bushes, trees, and
even on driveways. Always get your prey from a reputable company or raise
it yourself.
As distasteful as this diet may be for some ferret owners, it’s important that
you fully educate yourself on every diet that’s available to your ferret. Diet is
such an important part of your ferret’s well-being. I’d be negligent to leave
out this important choice.
Exploring the alternative way of feeding
Perhaps the previous information in this section has sold you on a raw or
evolutionary diet, but you’re wondering how exactly to feed it to your ferret.
After all, raw or live food may be a little messier than kibble. You’ll certainly
have to stay on top of the hygiene aspect of the feeding. And diligence will
need to be at the top of your priority list. How you feed, though, depends on
your ferret’s manners and preferences and your setup.
Some ferrets have nice manners and eat over their bowls; I don’t know any of
them, though. Many are hoarders who cache their food for snacks at a later
date. And some may pick up their food and drop it a foot or two away from
their bowls and eat it there. It’s likely that most ferrets will behave differently
each time they eat — especially if their diets consist of something they par-
ticularly like. Keep these thoughts in mind when developing a feeding routine
for your ferret.
The following sections detail how you can convert your ferret to the natural
diet and how you can cater your feedings to ferrets that roam free and ferrets
that dwell in a cage.
The most important part of feeding your ferret a natural diet full of raw foods
is hygiene. Your health (and your family’s) is your top priority:
 Wash your hands frequently, as well as your countertop and any utensils
you use.
 Store the food according to manufacturer’s instructions when applicable.
Wash food bowls regularly and thoroughly.
 Mop the floors where a ferret eats.
 Wash ferret bedding and wipe down cage surfaces with a mild bleach
solution more frequently (see Chapter 9 for more).
135
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

Converting your ferret to the natural world
Ferrets, like their polecat cousins, are olfactory hunters, meaning that they
follow their noses to the dinner table. Whatever a ferret has consistently
eaten during the first six months of her life, she’ll see as the preferred food in
the future — called olfactory imprinting.
Getting a ferret to betray her nose after chowing on kibble for so long can be
challenging. However, it’s well worth the effort if you’re a true believer in the
natural diet and want to broaden your ferret’s culinary horizons. Of course,
the conversion should occur when your fuzzy is as young as possible, but
you can teach old ferrets new tricks. However, not all ferrets can be brought
around — particularly the older kids. Make sure that you give it your all
before giving up, though. Here are a couple steps you can take to start the
process:
1. If you haven’t already been feeding canned food, start introducing
high-quality canned cat or kitten food to your ferret. You can add the
food in a separate bowl, but mixing it with dry food will force the ferret
to taste it. Occasionally, you can switch to a high-quality canned dog
food just for variety. The poopy smell gets worse with canned food, but
the end result (oh crap, a pun) causes less-stinky poops.
2. Invest in baby food. Yep, you read that right. You can use meat baby
food, from infant to toddler, as an enticement for your ferret to try a new
food. The chicken variety works well. Rub some of it on the ferret’s nose
or front teeth if she won’t readily accept it. She’ll surely lick it off.
Don’t expect a change overnight. Persistence and experimentation are the
keys to converting your ferret to a more natural diet. All ferrets are different.
Some take several days to convert. Others take a week or so. After you get
your ferret used to the idea of eating different food, though, you can step up
your efforts and include more natural/evolutionary foods. Here are some tips
to follow:
 Put aside some freezer space for frozen mice. Some people feed pre-
killed chicks rather than mice. You usually can purchase pre-killed mice
or chicks at a pet store — particularly one that sells reptiles. Store the
animals in the freezer and thaw them as needed. After your ferret learns
that a mouse or chick is food, the occasional frozen treat is okay. During
winter, carnivores eat frozen meat all the time. When your ferret discov-
ers that the mouse or chick is tasty, she’ll be hooked.
 Experiment with poultry. You can chop up small pieces of chicken,
turkey, or other poultry (bones and all) and allow your ferret to get a
taste. You can use either cooked or raw poultry, depending on your com-
fort level. If you don’t want to make a special ferret meal, save a couple
cut-up pieces after your next poultry dinner.
136
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

 Become an organ donor. Chicken, pork, and beef livers, as well as
chicken and beef hearts, are great treats and are full of nutrition. Slice
them up and offer the cuts to your fuzzy. Liver, by itself, is a great occa-
sional meal.
 Be creative with hamburger. Perhaps you’ve had those days when you
mix anything you can find in the cupboards or freezer with hamburger.
My mother called it junk, but we ate it, and it actually tasted good most
of the time. Cook up some beef and add ground bones or kibble. Form it
in shapes like the kibble if you must. Just be creative.
 Use natural juices. Many people forget how tasty the juices from cooked
meats can be. I always use the juices as gravy over dry food. Natural
juices can be a great introduction to a new taste, either in a separate
bowl or over a small amount of kibble.
 Throw in some fishies. Canned tuna in spring water is yummy to many
ferrets. Try it. You also can try feeding other prepared fish, such as trout
or salmon, cooked shellfish, shrimp, and crawdads. Feeder fish are
yummy, too.
 Don’t forget the bugs. Even my dogs and cats eat bugs! Earthworms,
crickets, cockroaches, and mealworms are tasty treats for your ferret.
Your fuzzy, when she gets used to the idea, will eat only the squishy,
juicy parts and leave the rest for you!
You may find that one of your ferrets loves liver, while another prefers ham-
burger. Remember, the natural diet is about freedom of choice! Conversion
may take a little patience on your part. And don’t forget that these natural
foods spoil quickly. Don’t let any linger around your ferret’s cage or eating
area for too long. If the food is still there in 12 hours, get rid of it! If you have
to, try something different later.
Ferret expert Bob Church’s advice for natural diet conversion is to offer the
food to a ferret three times a day for three days. Wait a week and again offer
the food three times a day for three days. If the ferret still turns up its nose 
at the food, offer it as an occasional enrichment, pulling it off the dietary
shelf (for more on enrichment, see Chapter 10). This advice is for animals
that readily accept strange foods. You can use it to determine personal pref-
erence. And keep notes so you don’t have to repeat the exercise at a later
date.
When your ferret finally switches to a raw food or evolutionary diet, she’ll be
likely to try just about anything, which is important because you don’t want
to stick to just one food item in this diet. She still needs a combination of soft
and hard foods. Besides, some of the foods I mention in this chapter aren’t
complete diets. The combination of the foods is what makes them so good
for your fuzzy. So don’t rule out kibble for good. The biggest piece of bad
news about natural diets? Your friends will often stare into your refrigerator
in terror!

Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

Free-roaming ferrets
As a feeder of a raw, freeze-dried raw, or an evolutionary diet, it’s up to you to
reexamine and adjust your feeding habits and routines so that caching or
other behaviors associated with free-roaming ferrets don’t become hygiene
problems in your home. Imagine the olfactory shock that will hit you three to
four days after your beloved ferret has cached some raw meat or a mouse in
a secret hidey-hole. And the biggest problem is that the hidey-hole remains
top secret, and it’s your job to sniff it out.
For beginners in the natural dieting world, I don’t generally recommend
feeding your ferret openly where she free roams, although many people
do it with great success. The reason is simple: Some people aren’t as
hygiene-conscientious as they need to be when dealing with raw meat or
prey animals. Although you may be fully aware of each and every hidey-hole
your ferret has, meaning that you can retrieve uneaten foods at the end of
the feeding (or day), you can’t see the invisible trail left while the ferret was
dragging the food there. Too many surfaces can become contaminated
without you even knowing it.
I suggest you set up a “feeding playpen” — which is a small contained area
that the ferret can’t escape from — in a tiled room and feed your ferret in it.
Let her have her fill for a couple hours or however long it takes. Some ferrets
eat quickly. Some may take a while before showing interest in their meat or
mice. That’s the downside of putting a time limit on feeding. You want to give
your ferret adequate time to eat her share, so get to know your ferret’s eating
habits.
The downside to the feeding playpen method is that you remove some of the
enrichment aspects of the feeding. I like to encourage my ferrets to forage; I
often hide their food, whether it’s meat or mice or kibble, and they must sniff
it out (for more on enrichment, see Chapter 10). If you get comfortable with
your ferret’s eating habits and your ability to handle raw meats and prey ani-
mals hygienically, you can begin to experiment with different feeding rou-
tines. You may find that feeding in an open area works better for you and
your ferret. There’s more than one way for this to work.
Caged ferrets
Yes, caged ferrets have to eat, too, and you have to be just as diligent when it
comes to hygiene. A feeding playpen, which I describe in the previous sec-
tion, works just as well for caged ferrets. Small rooms, such as bathrooms,
work perfectly for feeding, also. Or you can simply feed the meat or prey ani-
mals in the upper level of your ferret’s cage (see Chapter 5 for more on cage
construction). Your ferret likely will pull the mice and meat down into her
bedding. You simply shake out the bedding at the end of the feeding and put
in fresh bedding. Some people just change the bedding on a daily basis. I find
this to be an acceptable practice as long as you also wipe down and clean the
cage on a regular basis to prevent an accumulation of harmful bacteria.
138
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Your ferret’s cage is a haven for bacteria, no matter what you do. She’ll poop
in her litter box and possibly outside of it, and then walk in it and trudge
through the cage and bedding. Bacteria multiply on her kibble, which she’ll
drop into her bedding. She licks her behind and then licks her water bottle.
Your ferret doesn’t live a sanitary life, nor should she. The good news?
Absence of immune-system-challenging microorganisms can actually be
harmful to your ferret. Living in a sterile or super-clean environment may
lead to immune problems later down the road. This is called the hygiene
hypothesis. Google it!
Supplementing Your Fuzzy’s Diet
A supplement is something you add to your ferret’s diet to make up for what’s
lacking in her day to day feedings. If your healthy ferret is on a truly balanced
and suitable diet, she doesn’t really need supplements. Although supple-
ments were a necessary part of a ferret’s diet years ago, today most diets
available to your ferret are better formulated, thus more balanced for a fuzzy.
Often, giving supplements is more a matter of choice because a ferret enjoys
the taste and sees them as treats.
The most common supplement is a fatty-acid oil supplement, which ferrets
find pleasant. The right fatty-acid supplement can be just what the doctor
ordered or your worst nightmare. This section explains what you need to
know about omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are the most commonly
found fatty acids in pet-store supplements. Most supplements list the ingredi-
ents as I’ve listed them.
Fatty acids have to be incorporated into the cell membranes, so it may take
several weeks for their effects to show. In fact, you may not see changes for
two to three months. If possible, experts recommend that you split the daily
dose, giving a half dose each in two 12-hour increments. Your ferret will still
get a full daily dose, just not at once.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Omega-3 fatty acids, in general, have some great properties. They may slow
the spread of cancer, reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and prevent
ventricular arrhythmias. In addition to alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), the ingredi-
ents are as follows:
 Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA): Reduces inflammation in atopy, arthritis,
autoimmune disease, seborrhea, and decreases cholesterol
 Docosahhexoenoic acid (DHA): Reduces inflammation in atopy
139
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

Omega-6 fatty acids
Most quality pet foods contain adequate amounts of omega-6 fatty acids. Rich
sources of this fatty acid include cold-water fish oils and the seeds of some
plants such as sunflowers, borages, pumpkins, soybean, and flax. In addition
to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), the following list presents the ingre-
dients in the supplement and the benefits (or detriments) they bring:
 Linoleic acid (LA): Helps improve dry skin and a dull hair coat
 Gamma linolenic acid (GLA): Reduces inflammation in atopy and auto-
immune disease
 Arachidonic acid (AA): Can increase inflammation
Savoring Treat Time!
Treats can be a vital part of your relationship with your ferret, as long as
they’re the right types and are given in moderation. Some fuzzies come to
expect a favorite treat at a certain time of day or after performing a neat trick.
They all beg for them no matter what. Of course, all ferrets deserve treats.
But, before starting your ferret on treats, discuss doing so with your veteri-
narian. Some traditional treats can aggravate medical conditions such as
insulinoma or chronic bowel disease. My goal is to get you away from tradi-
tional bad treats and onto healthy ones! Better safe than sorry. The following
sections show you the way.
Next time you’re shopping for your ferret’s treats in the pet store, take a look
at the ingredients. Do you see any meat in the lists? Many treats don’t even
contain meat, or if they do, the meat often is way down on the lists. What you
find high on the list more often than not is sugar and even more sugar —
maybe even some plant materials that aren’t good for ferrets. Avoid these
and stick to the meat-based treats.
Giving the good stuff
Here are some treats that you can offer your ferret in moderation (remember
to feed these in very small pieces and very small amounts; even the good
stuff can be harmful if overfed):
 Eggs: Hard-boiled, poached, raw, or scrambled. Egg yolks (cooked or
raw) are very nutritious. Eggs are perfect protein treats. However, some
people won’t risk feeding raw eggs due to the possibility of germs or
harmful bacteria. It’s a personal choice.
140
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

 Meat: Cooked or raw meats are great treats. Special favorites are chicken
livers and hearts. Beef and turkey pieces are good, also. If you have a
dehydrator, you can make your own unseasoned turkey, salmon, beef, or
chicken jerky to give as treats. You should avoid processed meats such
as lunchmeat or salami, because they’re full of salt and additives.
A great treat for a half-dozen ferrets is to open a large fish-oil capsule,
pour the oil into a dish, cut up some raw chicken (no more than
1-square-inch pieces), and place the pieces in the oil. Heat the mix in the
microwave until the chicken just starts to turn white. This may destroy
some of the nutrients, but it makes a great occasional treat.
 Insects: Earthworms, crickets, cockroaches, and mealworms are tasty
treats. Just about anything you’d feed reptiles or amphibians will make a
great treat for a ferret.
 Small prey animals: Mice, chicks, frogs, lizards, and rats all are healthy
treats or main diet choices for your ferret (see the section “The evolu-
tionary diet: Feeding your pet small animals/insects”).
 Chicken baby food: A single lick or two from a spoon or off your finger
is a nice way to say “I love you” to your ferret, or “job well-done!” Most
ferrets love the taste of the baby food. Remember, though, not to give
too much as to spoil her regular meal.
 Nonacidic, soft fruits: Melon, banana, berries, and papaya are good
ones. Okay, so this isn’t at the top of the list, but I had to sneak one in
for the sweet-tooths in the bunch. Give no more than one to two tiny
pieces (1⁄2 teaspoon) of these fruits a couple times a week. Most fruits are
high-sugar treats, so watch the insulinoma patients!
 High-quality kibble: Most ferrets view a piece of their regular kibble as a
treat if you feed the kibble from your hand. If this works for your ferret,
she not only gets a treat, but also isn’t straying too far from her diet!
This feeding method also is a good way to introduce a new food item.
I’ve found that ferrets see almost any type of cooking oil as a treat. Mine espe-
cially enjoy fish-oil treats, but they never turn down a bit of olive oil on the end
of my finger. You can cut open a fish-oil capsule, which contains enough oil to
“treat” a handful of ferrets. Like all supplements, you should do this infre-
quently. My rule is, if your ferret wants a lot, she shouldn’t get it very often.
Avoiding the not-so-good stuff
There is such a thing as loving your ferret to death. Many dog and cat owners
do so unknowingly with large amounts of treats and table scraps. Although
some treats will be fine for your ferret if given in moderation, you should
avoid some not-so-healthy treats altogether, no matter how much your ferret
141
Chapter 8: Filling Your Ferret’s Belly

begs. When your ferret fills herself with junk, she decreases the amount of
room she has for good food. The following list presents the not-so-good
treats you should toss out of your ferret’s diet:
 Alcohol and other high-sugar drinks/foods: Too much sugar is a bad
thing for a ferret. And a drunk ferret can quickly become a dead ferret.
(Besides, you must be 21 to legally drink.)
 Coffee and tea products: No caffeine, please. Like ferrets don’t speed
around enough.
 Dried fruits, including raisins: Sorry guys and gals! These and other
high-sugar fruit treats are on the banned list!
 Most commercial ferret treats: Most are low in or absent of meat con-
tent but high in sugar. Check the labels carefully.
 High-calorie/high-sugar supplements: The major ingredient of Nutri-Cal
(and similar products), for instance, is molasses, which if given to an
insulinomic ferret when she isn’t in the middle of a low-sugar incident
can be unhealthy.
 Cereals: A good cereal treat must be low-salt and low-sugar, which most
aren’t. Two good ones are Cheerios and Kix. Other good ones are out
there, too. No more than one to two pieces a day.
 Veggies: Vegetables may get lodged in the intestinal tract. Veggies also
have little nutritional value for ferrets, and they come out the other end
basically undigested if they make it that far.
 Dairy products: Many experts argue about lactose intolerance in ferrets.
Some vets say it’s prevalent, and others say it isn’t. A single lick of milk
probably won’t harm most healthy ferrets. In fact, owners frequently use
heavy cream (the real stuff) as a high-fat supplement to add weight on
and boost energy in a debilitated ferret. And cheese contains very little
lactose, so very small amounts are probably safe. Use your best judg-
ment. If what you feed comes out the other end in smelly liquid form,
your ferret probably is sensitive to lactose, but a little diarrhea from a
small amount of dairy product won’t harm her.
 Seeds and nuts: These things are indigestible and hard to pass, not to
mention painful. They can cause blockages.
 Chocolate: Contains theobromide, which, in high doses, can be fatal in
some pets (such as dogs). No one knows for sure if chocolate is as dan-
gerous to ferrets. Milk chocolate is generally much safer. The big prob-
lem isn’t the trace amounts of theobromide in the milk chocolate, it’s the
tons of sugar. Don’t panic if your fuzzy accidentally happens on a tiny
piece of chocolate, but don’t use chocolate as a treat.
 Salty foods: Save the beer nuts for the bar. A small taste here or there,
though, won’t kill a ferret.
 Fingers: Just seeing if you’re paying attention!

ouldn’t you like to have a butler deliver your clean, happy ferret to
you on the couch — and then get to work cleaning his cage and litter
box — so you can just concentrate on the romping, playing, and cuddling
parts? Okay, back to reality; most people don’t have butlers, so they must
face the routine chores of keeping ferrets. I’m talking about odor control,
grooming, and general sanitation stuff here.
If you’re anything like I am, you’ll find it very satisfying to watch your gor-
geous, clean, healthy ferret dash about with enthusiasm and then collapse in
his unsoiled condo for a long nap. Besides giving you an opportunity to bond
and discover possible health problems, cleaning and grooming are necessary
for both your and your ferret’s continued happiness and health.
In this chapter, I discuss the ins and outs of cleaning your fuzzy’s cage, bed-
ding, and dishes. I provide much-needed information on cleaning your fuzzy,
too. Oh, cheer up. Into every life a little poop must fall!
Cleaning House for a Cozy Cage
When I say you need to regularly clean your fuzzy’s house, I mean the entire
house. What good is a sparkling cage if his bedding still has poop stuck in it
or his toys are crusty from heaven knows what? Sometimes, people forget to
do the whole overhaul. I admit it, I’m guilty at times. Just remember that you

144
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
and your fuzzy will be happiest when the cleaning tornado hits the entire
ferret condo. The following sections take you through the cleaning process
for the cage, dishes, toys, bed, and toilet.
Doing your fuzzy’s dishes
When I set out to clean my ferret’s cage, I tackle food dishes and water bot-
tles first, because I think one of the most important aspects of good hus-
bandry is providing clean, fresh food and water at all times. Because pooping
and peeing are frequent activities with ferrets, you’re likely to find an occa-
sional mess in the food dish or poop smeared on the side of it. If you notice
this, or an unusually dirty bowl, take the dish out immediately and clean it
thoroughly. If you ignore it, the poop/dirt won’t go away. Trust me, I’ve tried.
Otherwise, regular cleanings with soap and warm water every couple days
usually are sufficient. You should have extra food dishes and water bottles on
hand to swap with the dirty dishes that you’ll be cleaning.
Maintenance on the dishes and bottles is simple. Soap and water should be
adequate when coupled with a gentle scrubbing (with a bottlebrush, for
instance). You also can use a mixture of vinegar and water or baking soda
and water. The key to good husbandry is to scrub thoroughly to remove any
particle or algae buildup. And don’t neglect the tube and stainless steel balls
on the water bottle. Keeping these things free of mineral deposits helps elimi-
nate any leakage. Always remember to completely rinse before refilling.
A more effective cleaning solution is a mixture of warm water and a touch of
bleach. At least once a week, clean all the dishes with the bleach and water
solution (1:30). Unless you have bionic eyes, you can’t see all the bacteria
condos going up on your ferret’s dishes. Come to terms with the fact that
bacteria is there and wash frequently. Your ferret will thank you.
Properly rinsing dishes is just as important as cleaning the dishes. Although
a trace amount of soap won’t kill your ferret, it tastes pretty bad and can
cause diarrhea. In addition, the residue attracts more dirt and bacteria.
Bleach, on the other hand, can cause your ferret to become very ill. Take care
when washing the dishes, and be sure to rinse well. As a safeguard, I wash
with soap and water after I use bleach. After all, can anyone be too careful
when dealing with their precious furballs?
Anything from a ferret cage may be contaminated with poop. Don’t use the
kitchen or kitchen sink when cleaning if at all possible because you can con-
taminate areas where you prepare food. Contamination can come with
enteric bacteria like E. coli and salmonella from any pet contaminated items
that you clean in a kitchen. Instead, use a bathroom sink, bathtub or laundry-
room sink to do your cleaning. If the kitchen area is your only option, be sure
to clean out the sink with a disinfectant and thoroughly clean any counter
surfaces with disinfectant, such as Lysol or your bleach solution.

Stripping his bed
Your ferret’s bedding can get pretty raunchy after a while. Because ferrets
spend so much time running in and out of the litter box, chances are good
that traces of poop and urine will make their way to your fuzzy’s towels or
other bedding. Particles of litter and food crumbs get mixed in there as well.
Your fuzzy spends a lot of time snuggling and sleeping in his bedding, so thor-
oughly washing his bedding at least once a week is important.
Doing ferret laundry is no different from doing human laundry. I use laundry
soap and hot water. Sometimes, I add a half-cup of bleach to the load. If you
like this suggestion, make sure that the finished laundry doesn’t have a
strong bleach odor. If it does, another regular wash should fix the problem.
Before you toss in a load, though, consider the health of your washing
machine. I always take bedding outside and thoroughly shake it out before
throwing it in the washer. That way, I discard most of the loose litter and
debris before washing the bedding. Look for little poopies that may be stuck
to the bedding and pick them off. You don’t want to throw debris into your
washing machine. Trust me, there’s nothing like wearing a “clean” shirt with a
poop stain on it! Worse yet is having someone point it out to you.
Scrubbing (or scooping) the toilet
You should scoop litter boxes as often as you can, refilling them with litter as
needed. Obviously, if you have many ferrets, it doesn’t take long for the poop
to start piling up. You’ll notice the insides of the litter box getting pretty dirty
after a short while, because most ferrets poop in the corners or at an edge.
Some fuzzies hang their butts over the side, and the poop lands on the litter
box edge.
Cleaning the litter box regularly helps reduce the number of accidents that
happen outside the box, because most ferrets hate to get their feet dirty —
unless they’re playing outside in the dirt and sand.
You’ll soon find out that cleaning the litter box can be a nasty undertaking.
Use common sense when cleaning the waste. I take out all litter boxes and
empty them completely into the garbage at least once a week. Use a rag or
dish sponge (not the one from your kitchen) to scrub the bottom and sides of
the litter box. Usually, soap and water are sufficient. At least twice a month, I
use bleach water to clean the box. Don’t forget to clean the C-clamps that
hold the litter box to the cage (see Chapter 5), because they can get quite
nasty, too.
145
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

Tearing down the house
Cleaning the cage can be the most time-consuming and tedious chore. You
should clean the cage at least once every couple weeks. I suggest that if the
weather is nice, you drag the entire cage outside and hose that sucker down
with high-pressure water. The rest of the time, you need to get on your hands
and knees and reach into the cage to get it clean. (For more on a ferret’s cage,
head to Chapter 5.) Here are the steps I take:
1. Pull out any catch pans in the cage so you can change the newspaper
or catch litter.
2. Sweep up the displaced litter and food particles from the flooring.
A little hand-held vacuum is perfect for this task.
3. Spray the flooring with a pet-friendly cleaner and wipe it thoroughly,
remembering to leave no residue behind.
You can find ferret-friendly cleaners in most pet stores. You’re finished
with the easy part!
4. This step is the hard part: getting any solidified poop off the corners
of the wire shelves.
I use rubber gloves and pull off the waste. What doesn’t come off with
the initial tug I push off with a long, metal stick (such as a shish-ka-bob
skewer). You can also use a scouring pad, although the pad can be too
abrasive and wear down any paint on the wire. A tool that works well is
a nylon scrub pad — the kind you may use with a Teflon pan. It has a
nylon mesh over a sponge. It doesn’t ruin paint and it does a good job,
after the cage has been wetted down, of getting crusty stuff off.
5. After you clear off most of the poop, use a wet rag and thoroughly
clean all the areas of the cage.
If you have short arms like I do or a cage that’s difficult to reach into, you
may find that you can’t reach one or two far corners that always seem to
have a small bit of poop residue. That’s when hosing can be most effective.
6. Now you’re ready to reassemble the cage.
Getting the gunk off the toys
Don’t neglect the fuzzy’s toys when you’re cleaning his house — a mistake
often made by us humans. Assume they’re dirty every time you strip the
cage, even if they look clean. The toys get dragged about the ferret’s litter
box and buried in his dirty bedding. Check them daily, as well, for obvious
signs of being pooped or peed on. The cleaning method you use depends on
the type of toy in question. You can safely throw most cloth toys in the wash
with the rest of his bedding.
146
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

As for plastic toys, I simply soak them in bleach water or plain, warm water
until I can easily scrub off all the grime. The important part is to always
remember to thoroughly rinse the toys and leave no residue.
If you happen upon a toy buried beneath a pile of poop or in another messy sit-
uation, it’s okay to just pitch it and buy your ferret a new toy. Some things are
just too gross to clean. Plus, fuzzbutts deserve new toys as often as possible!
Scrub a Dub Fuzz: Navigating Bathtime
You have plenty to think about before bathing a smelly little ferret — such as
choosing the right shampoo and knowing when and where to bathe him. Plus,
not all ferrets like baths, so knowing what to do and what not to do can ease
the anxiety both of you may be feeling. The following sections explain all the
factors you must consider, and then I take you through the actual process of
bathing your fuzzy.
One bath too many?
It’s hard to believe that bathing a ferret may defeat the purpose — namely,
making the fuzzy smell fresh — but it can be true. Bathing is important, but
equally important is not washing your fuzzy too frequently. Bathing strips the
skin and fur of their natural oils. The skin must work overtime to reproduce
these oils to replace what you washed down the drain, making the smell worse
initially. Excessive bathing also can lead to dry, flaky skin and coarse fur.
You’ll probably notice initially that your ferret has a stronger smell than
before the bath. Don’t worry. The smell improves within a day or two.
Unless your ferret gets into something really nasty, don’t bathe him more
than once a month. I suggest bathing only a few times a year. Look at it this
way: It gives the scratches on your arms ample time to heal before you bathe
the furball again!
Picking a shampoo
The shampoo you use on your ferret should be very gentle, like baby sham-
poo. Don’t use strong shampoos and regular dish soaps; they can lead to dry,
itchy skin and brittle fur. Some over-the-counter pet shampoos work well, as
long as the shampoo is safe for cats. Your vet may carry some good sham-
poos that are great for sensitive skin. There are also many ferret shampoos
available on the market now. Dog shampoos often contain harsh chemicals
that are safe for dogs but very harmful to ferrets.
147
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

Choose only shampoos that are ferret-safe. If you’re unsure about a shampoo,
stick with stuff that’s made for cats, kittens, or ferrets. A tearless human baby
shampoo also works well on ferrets.
If your ferret is unfortunate enough to have fleas, be sure to read Chapter 14
before picking a shampoo and bathing him.
Choosing the crime scene
Where’s the best place to bathe your ferret? The bathtub is an obvious
choice. Many people look at bath time as a great opportunity for the water-
loving fuzzy to play in the bathtub. This is okay, but limit the free swim to
before the water gets all soapy and yucky. The downside to bathing in the tub
is that it’s tough on the human back and knees.
Many ferrets get so excited at the thought of bathing (yeah, right) that they
poop in the water, so you may have to do some cleanup right away!
Sinks also are great places to clean a smelly ferret. The water flow from a sink
faucet is a little gentler, and your back and knees will thank you. Avoid the
kitchen sink for hygiene reasons; choose either a bathroom or laundry-room
sink. Pull-out hoses are good for easy rinsing.
Some people even let their fuzzies into the shower with them. Unless your
ferret is comfortable with this method and manageable in the shower — or
you shower with your clothes on — I urge you to take extra precaution. A
naked human is an extra-vulnerable human!
148
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
What’s with my ferret’s tail acne?
Ferrets are prone to blackheads just like
humans, although a ferret’s usually show up on
his tail. Often, hair loss and a reddish-brown,
waxy film come with blackheads, which are
caused by dirt and oil clogging their fuzzy pores.
Although blackheads aren’t too attractive,
they’re nothing to worry about. If you want to
treat them, simply wash your fuzzy’s tail every
couple days (the tail only) with a shampoo that
contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid
(which you can get from your vet). Gently scrub
the tail with a washcloth and let the suds sit for
a minute or two before rinsing.

Doing the deed
You need to do some preparatory work before you can begin the deed of
bathing. First, you need some good supplies: an appropriate shampoo, plenty
of clean, dry towels for both you and your ferret, and hip boots and goggles
(for you). The water you prepare should be a temperature that’s comfortable
for a human child.
A ferret’s body temperature is quite a bit higher than a human’s (100–104°F).
What feels warm to you may be a pinch too chilly for a ferret, causing fuzzy
goosebumps. Keep the water warm, but always test it before wetting your
ferret; you don’t want to scald the little bugger.
Fill the tub, sink, or basin with the water — just deep enough to submerge
the ferret’s body while allowing his feet to touch the bottom. This gives the
anxious fuzzy a little extra security, because being unable to feel solid ground
beneath your feet can be a terrifying experience.
Now you’re ready to bathe. But what if your ferret isn’t? The following sec-
tions give you some tips for bathing a water-shy ferret and take you through
the normal bathing process.
Bathing a reluctant ferret
When it comes to bath time, not all ferrets enjoy water like their otter
cousins. Some act like housecats when they get the slightest bit of water on
their paws. Others, fortunately, take to it with Olympic-like style. Oftentimes,
a ferret’s first few encounters with water will determine his attitude. Whether
your ferret’s disdain for baths is due to his personality or to post-traumatic
stress disorder, your job as a ferret human is to make the bathing process as
pleasurable as possible.
If you can convince your fuzzy to look at bath time as a treat and reward,
your battle may not be as big. Keep in mind that bathing the resistant ferret
will not hurt him unless you’re too forceful. You may need to lightly scruff
him (see Chapter 7) and allow his feet to touch the bottom of the sink or tub
to support his weight. Here are some more tips:
1. Allow him to play in the sink or tub for a moment without any water
to get used to the crime scene.
2. Turn on the faucet just enough for a thin stream to come out, and
allow your ferret to explore the water. Offer him a treat, such as a lick
of meat baby food from a spoon, as a reward for being a good boy.
149
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

3. While he’s still licking his chops, pick him up and put him under the
warm stream of water. Offer him another lick of treat.
4. Slowly increase the flow of water until he’s all wet.
5. Put your ferret down and offer him one more lick of treat. Continue
onto the next section.
Water anxiety, of course, magically disappears after bath time. I frequently
find myself spending time racing to keep my ferrets out of full coffee cups,
toilets, and the dogs’ water bowls. Bath anxiety may just be a control thing.
Who knows for sure?
Wax on, wax off
I start a ferret’s bath by lathering his back, because that’s the easiest place to
pour the shampoo. You can also pour the shampoo on your hands and rub
your hands together before lathering him up. From there, I spread the sham-
poo evenly across all parts of his body, including the top of his head. Be care-
ful not to get any soap in his eyes and ears. Some shampoos sting like heck,
and your ferret will be sure to hold a grudge for next time. If you do get soap
in your ferret’s eyes, flush his face gently with water, using a cupped hand.
A ferret with water-soaked fur is slightly heavier than a dry ferret, so take
extra care to support his full weight during and after the bath. It can be tricky
to lather up the rascal while he’s trying to crawl up your arm. You almost
need an extra set of hands — two to hold the ferret, one to pour the sham-
poo, and one to lather. Giving a bath is an art that’s quickly mastered by the
multi-ferreted human, though.
Keeping soap out of your ferret’s mouth can be more challenging. Plenty of
fuzzies seem to enjoy the taste of soap. Although this quirk may appear dis-
gusting to some, I must defend the ferret by saying I also enjoyed the taste of
soap when I was a child. Unlike me, though, a ferret won’t outgrow the taste. A
little bit of soap won’t hurt him, but keep him from sneaking in a lick anyway
because there’s nothing nutritious in soap and too much can make him ill.
After you have his body lathered up, you can get ready to rinse. Rinsing thor-
oughly is as important as lathering. Besides drying out his fur and making
him itchy, soap residue left on the fur attracts dirt and gunk, and you’ll soon
have a dirty ferret again. For this reason, I suggest that you drain the water
basin and use fresh, warm water to rinse. You can use a cup to pour the
water over your ferret, or you can hold the ferret under the faucet — as long
as the water pressure isn’t too hard (see Figure 9-1). I enjoy using a hose that
attaches to the faucet. Some sinks already have built-in hoses.
Don’t drown the poor bugger while rinsing. In other words, don’t pour water
directly over his head. Use your hand to scoop water onto his head and to
act as a washcloth. Remember to rinse the hard-to-reach areas, like the
armpits and throat. A well-rinsed furball is a squeaky-clean furball!

Before you rinse, test the water temperature. Water that’s too hot scalds, and
water that’s too cold causes your ferret to scramble for cover.
Drying out
If you think a dog makes a fuss after a bath, wait until you get a load of the
ferret. Drying time is a major production, no doubt about it. For fuzzy, this is
happy, hopping, dooking time — a time for puffed tails and sideways sashays.
The ferret’s main goal is to get as dry and as filthy as he possibly can in the
shortest amount of time. This means he’ll try to rub up against anything and
everything he can, from the couch cushions to the dust bunnies behind the
sofa — and that disgusting little spot you can’t reach behind the toilet.
You want to prevent your fuzzbutt from undoing all your hard work, which
means you must take it upon yourself to dry him or at least allow him to dry
himself in a clean, safe place. First things first: Towel-dry him as best you can,
making sure that you’re gentle yet thorough in removing as much water as
possible. Some people like to use warm towels to dry their ferrets. You can
warm a towel in the clothes dryer or microwave, but make sure you don’t let
the towel get too hot.

Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

A great place for drying time is a bathtub filled with dry towels. You can also
use a bathroom (with drained tub and toilet lid down) or the play room.
Wherever you decide to let your ferret dry, though, keep in mind that he’ll
want to go to the bathroom soon after his bath. If he poops on your towel
setup, he’ll probably try to step in it, roll in it, and fall asleep in it. Drying
time should be a supervised time. Besides, you wouldn’t want to miss the
drama for the world!
Some ferrets allow owners to use a hair dryer. (If you use a little round brush,
you can give your fuzzy a little extra poof — just kidding.) For this method,
use the warm, not hot, setting and keep the dryer moving so you don’t aim
warm air at the same part of the body for too long, which can cause burns
(and split ends). Also, keep the dryer at least 12 inches from the body to pre-
vent burns.
If after drying your ferret is still damp, you need to put him in a place where
he can finish drying off. The best spot is a warm place with no drafts. And
unless his cage is clean, filled with clean towels, and temporarily has the
litter box removed, that spot is out of the question.
Caring for Those Little Ears
A ferret’s normal earwax is light or reddish brown. It should have very little,
if any, odor to it. If it stinks, something is wrong. Some furballs need their
ears cleaned more frequently than others. Some can go for long periods of
time. Health, age, and season may determine how much wax your fuzzy pro-
duces, so be sure to consult with your vet and follow your nose to any possi-
ble problems. What your eyes may miss, your nose may discover. I, for one,
use playtime as an opportunity to do a quick ear inspection.
Ear cleaning should be done no more frequently than once every two to three
months. Cleaning more frequently will cause more earwax production. In fact,
earwax is protective and shouldn’t be removed unless it’s excessive or your
ferret is about to enter a ferret show (see Chapter 10). Not cleaning the ears
won’t cause ear mites, deafness, or infections. In fact, ear disease in ferrets is
pretty uncommon with the exception of mites, which are parasites transmit-
ted directly from one ferret to another.
The only thing to clean when you clean a ferret’s ears is the outer part — go
nowhere near the ear canal (the hole). You’re more likely to cause damage by
poking around in the ear and shoving the normal wax into the ear canal. The
following sections go through the preparation and the execution.
152
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Ear cleaning can be tough for a beginner, so I suggest you have your vet
demonstrate the procedure once or twice until you feel comfortable with it.
No matter how comfortable you become, though, your ferret will hate having
his ears cleaned. If done too often or incorrectly, it may be painful and
uncomfortable. Those cotton swabs may look tiny for your ears, but they
seem like large wads of cotton to a ferret. The key to preventing injury due to
panic is gentleness. If you don’t think you can handle the ear-cleaning
process, your vet should be more than happy to perform the procedure for a
minimal fee.
Gathering supplies
To clean your ferret’s ears, you definitely need some cotton swabs. Here are a
couple other things you need to acquire before you begin:
 A good liquid ear cleanser: You can purchase this product from most
pet supply stores or from your vet. Make sure that the solution is safe for
cats and kittens, because that means it will be safe for your fuzzy, too.
 A small dish: Especially if you have a bunch of ears to clean, a small
dish may be helpful. Pour a little ear-cleaning solution into the dish. You
can dip the clean end of a cotton swab into the liquid instead of fum-
bling around to squirt some on the tip. Some people moisten the tips of
several swabs before they begin. If you do, be sure you place them on a
clean surface to prevent them from getting dirty.
Executing the ear clean
Find a quiet and comfortable place to clean your ferret’s ears, and follow the
steps in this list:
1. Dip a clean cotton swab in the ear-cleaning solution.
2. Scruff or firmly hold your ferret (see Chapter 7).
Make sure that your ferret’s bottom is supported when you’re scruffing
him, especially if he’s a big guy. If he moves too much, you can lessen
the bottom support a little until he settles down. You also can try getting
a better hold of the scruff from the beginning.
3. Using your scruffing hand, hold the tip of his ear between your fin-
gers. With your other hand, use the moistened end of the swab to
wipe the inside of your ferret’s ear.
153
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

Some experienced ferret humans feel comfortable scruffing their ferrets
with one hand and using the other to clean the ears. I prefer to have a
helper hold my ferret. My arms eventually get sore from all the holding
(especially in my multi-ferret household), and I like to have one hand
free to hold my fuzzy’s ear when I’m maneuvering the cotton swab in the
other.
Always use the moistened end of the cotton swab first. It loosens and
scoops up a lot of the ear gunk. Starting off with the dry tip can be too
abrasive on the ferret’s sensitive ears.
4. Using a circular motion, make contact with the inner walls and
crevices of the ear to remove all the hidden gunk.
Never push the cotton swab into your ferret’s ear canal. You may
damage his ear canal or pack the earwax deep into it, making it difficult
to get out and hard for the ferret to hear.
A good guide is to make sure that you can see the tip of the swab.
5. Repeat with your collection of moistened swabs until the tips come
out with little or no ick on them.
Some ears require a repeat of the process with two or three freshly
moistened swabs.
Never reuse a dirty swab, and never dip a used swab into the cleaning
solution. Doing so contaminates the rest of the cleanser.
6. Using the dry end of a swab, repeat the circular wiping process.
Your ferret will probably squirm during the cleaning process. If you hit a par-
ticularly sensitive or itchy area, he may even jerk a leg back and forth like a
dog does when you find a perfect scratching spot. However, this isn’t a feel-
good reaction. Be gentler and pull out the swab in case you’re in too deep.
Remember, you can have a lick of Linatone when you’re finished as a treat for
a job well done. Make sure that your ferret gets a taste, too!
Nailing Down the Manicure
The bottom line is this: Trimming his nails makes your ferret more comfort-
able. Fuzzies need their claws for many things, from walking and balance to
climbing curtains and counter cruising. Overgrown nails can hurt the ferret,
because long nails prevent his foot from resting flat on the ground. Trimming
helps prevent the nails from splitting and getting caught on cage wires, car-
peting, and bedding. Clipping your fuzzbutt’s claws regularly also helps
lessen the severity of human scratches and damage from digging.
154
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

You need to clip nails frequently because ferrets should never be declawed. A
ferret’s claws are non-retractable — like the claws on rabbits and dogs (cats
have retractable claws) — so removing them would entail removing parts of
his toes. Most veterinarians find this mutilating surgery too inhumane to per-
form, as do I.
The frequency of clipping varies from ferret to ferret, because nail-growth
rates vary. Also, the amount and type of exercise you give your ferret factors
in, because a lot of play may wear down his nails. On average, I find that I
need to break out the nail trimmers every two to three weeks.
Now that you have the why and when down, you can get into the how. The
following sections break down the clipping method you can use and how you
can actually get the job done.
Choosing your clipping method
How you approach nail trimming depends on you and your ferret: You can
use the scruff method, the distract method, or the sneak-attack method. The
number of ferrets you have, your available time, the ferret’s tolerance to nail
clipping, and your ferret’s distractibility are key factors in determining the
method to use. The following list outlines these three methods:
 The scruff method is probably the quickest way to trim nails. It
steadies your ferret, gives you a better grip, and lessens the chance
of over-cutting. It generally calms the ferret (and you), so it’s great for
beginners who are getting used to the art of clipping.
If your scruffed ferret moves around a lot while you’re clipping, allow
him to lick a treat, such as meat baby food, while you scruff him. You
can clip his nails quickly and easily this way; however, this method does
require two people.
 The distract method can take a little more time, but it’s a nice way for
you and your ferret to spend some quality time together. The method
involves setting the fuzzy in your lap and placing a few drops of fatty
acid supplement, or another tasty substance, on his belly. While he
busies himself licking it off, you can dive in and clip before he has a
chance to object. This method doesn’t work with all ferrets, but it can be
worth a try.
 The sneak-attack method is performed while your ferret is in a deep
sleep. Depending on the quality of his sleep and your clipping talent, you
may get all 20 nails clipped or just 1 or 2 before he wakes up.
No matter what clipping method you choose, you should give a treat to 
your fuzzy during or after the manicure. You want him to look forward to his
clippings!
155
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

After you decide how you want to approach nail trimming, take a good look
at your ferret’s nails so you know what you’re dealing with. Most fuzzy nails
are long, curving, and dagger-like. Some fuzzies develop thicker nails as they
age. The nails on the back paws are much shorter because they wear down
more quickly, meaning they can be more difficult to clip. But unlike many
dogs, whose nails are solid black, a ferret’s nails are white. The quick, or vein,
is easy to see, so you know exactly how much nail tip you can clip. So you
have that going for you!
Performing the clip
To perform the clip, I use fingernail clippers designed for human babies.
Regular-size human clippers work well, too. Some people like to use cat- or
dog-nail clippers, but I find them too awkward to handle when clipping such
tiny nails. You also have a hard time seeing what you’re doing because of the
shape of the clipper. Whatever clippers you find most comfortable, make sure
that the blades are sharp before you clip. Dull blades can cause the nail walls
to crush, leaving the edges rough. Also, make sure that the lighting in the
room is adequate.
To trim your ferret’s nails, follow these steps (you can use any of the clipping
methods for these steps):
1. Take your thumb and first finger and hold the paw close to the toes,
with your thumb on the bottom of the paw.
2. Use the pressure of your thumb to spread the toes.
Doing so makes going from claw to claw easier.
3. Clip as much of the white nail tip off each toe as you can, leaving
some white after the quick (the interior of a ferret’s nail; see a cross-
section of a ferret nail in Figure 9-2).
Cutting into the quick is painful and causes the ferret to bleed. Because
accidents happen (perhaps you weren’t paying attention or your
fuzzbutt suddenly moved), have some styptic powder or cornstarch on
hand to stop any bleeding that may occur. Apply directly to the tip of
the bleeding nail. If those materials aren’t available, try dipping the
bleeding nail into a bar of white soap, beeswax, or flour. You also can try
running cold water over it. I suggest postponing the rest of the manicure
until after your ferret has forgiven your dreadful deed.
Even if the nail doesn’t bleed, cutting too close to the quick can be
painful, and your ferret will let you know. Take extra care with the back
nails, because some have teeny-weeny nail tips. Look closely before clip-
ping them. If the tips seem too short to clip, try filing them with a nail
file, being careful not to scrape the fuzzy’s sensitive paw pads.
156
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

If you let your ferret’s nails grow for a long time between cuttings, the quicks
will grow longer and longer into the nails, allowing you to cut off less and less
of the nails. This isn’t a good thing. Cutting frequently causes the quicks to
regress back toward the paws so that you can cut a good amount of the nails
off, giving your fuzzy more freedom and less of a chance of snagging.
Chewing On Chomper Maintenance
As a routine part of your ferret’s grooming process, you should check out his
teeth and gums. Tartar will build up on your ferret’s teeth, regardless of his
diet. In addition, neglected teeth can go bad and/or chip, leading to
abscesses that can seriously affect his health. Aging ferrets have more dental
problems than younger ones, so it’s up to you to sink your teeth into this
chore while your ferret is still young and chipper. Your fuzzy’s future health
and happiness depend on it.
All children resist brushing their teeth in the beginning, and a fuzzy is no dif-
ferent. The good news is, most ferrets get used to having their teeth cleaned
if you do so regularly and gently. In the sections that follow, I show you how
to perform a regular dental checkup, and I go through the process of brush-
ing your fuzzy’s teeth. Soon enough, you’ll be a brushing wizard!
Performing the dental checkup
The dental checkup is easy with most ferrets, although it can be quite a chal-
lenge with more difficult patients. Most of my carpet sharks sit in my lap with
minimal fidgeting and allow me to lift their gums for a peek. Others need to
be scruffed gently while I perform the dental inspection (see Chapter 7).
Figure 9-2:

157
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

I always like to have an extra pair of hands around so that I can concentrate
on my findings. No matter how you handle the inspection, be gentle. Your
ferret won’t understand why you’re poking around in his mouth, so take that
into consideration.
You have two main things to look for when doing the dental checkup: the
teeth and the gums.
With the exception of small traces of tartar buildup, if you see something out
of the ordinary in your furball’s mouth, contact your vet right away to sched-
ule a visit. Dental problems can be serious enough to cause death. Non-dental
problems that are located in the mouth are almost always signs of an under-
lying illness. Regardless of whether you have a dental emergency, your vet
should perform yearly dental exams on your fuzzy and remove any excess
tartar or decaying teeth.
Teeth
First, you should take a peek at all his teeth. The grayish or greenish discol-
oration you may see is tartar, which forms from plaque. Buildup happens at
the same time and at the same rate on all the teeth. However, the ferret’s
tongue acts as sort of a windshield wiper, helping clear away the gunk on the
lingual side, or “tongue side,” of the teeth. Because the self-cleaning is less
efficient on the outer side, tartar builds up faster on the buccal side, or
“cheek side,” of the teeth. And buildup occurs even faster in areas where
folds and crevices exist, such as on the carnassials or back teeth.
The stuff you see on the teeth isn’t necessarily the problem, though; even
small amounts of buildup can signal under-the-gum disease. Although tartar
doesn’t cause gingivitis — which is characterized by red, inflamed gums — it
may exacerbate the problem by injuring tissue and increasing the progres-
sion of gingivitis. Various stages of periodontal disease can follow gingivitis
and are marked by the actual recession of the gum line, as well as bone loss.
At this point, the ferret’s teeth lose their support, loosen, and fall out.
Diseased teeth can be painful, can lead to serious infection, and can cause
the ferret to stop eating.
Without tooth cleaning and regular vet checkups, buildup (and problems)
can increase as your ferret ages. A small amount of buildup is expected and
not necessarily a cause for concern; however, it can become your ferret’s
enemy if not kept in check.
Gums
The gums should be smooth, moist, and a medium-pink color. Red, inflamed
gums are a sign of gum disease, and your ferret should be treated immedi-
ately by your vet. If they appear very light in color (whitish/grayish/bluish),
your ferret may be seriously ill, so a visit to your vet is a must. If you notice
158
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

isolated swelling over one or two teeth, you can suspect a tooth abscess. If
you dare, stick your nose up to his mouth and take a whiff. Conditions such
as gum problems and ulcers result in a case of bad breath.
Ulcers on the gums or on the inside of the lip flap are a common sign of the
disease insulinoma. These ulcers usually are whitish in color, and sometimes
they ooze. Your ferret may point out these ulcers or other dental problems by
pawing at his mouth. Other signs include drooling and a crusty bib. Although
insulinoma isn’t necessarily a dental problem, it is something to keep an eye
out for as long as you have your eye in his mouth. (For more information on
insulinoma, see Chapter 16.)
If you notice your ferret has bad breath at any time — not just during a
checkup — you should call your vet to schedule an appointment. In addition
to being a sign of mouth ulcers and gum problems, bad breath may be an
indication of liver or kidney problems.
Brushing his teeth
After you perform an exam and find that everything is okay, what can you do
to prevent any future dental problems? Brush his teeth! You can make clean-
ing your ferret’s teeth a regular part of your grooming routine. All you have to
do is invest in a cat toothbrush (don’t use your spouse’s) or a human infant
toothbrush. You can purchase toothpaste designed for use on dogs or cats,
although it seems that most ferrets find the taste disagreeable — even the
meat flavored ones. It may be worth a try, though. You can also use
Petromalt, which aids in preventing hairballs.
Never use adult human toothpaste to brush your ferret’s teeth. The fluoride
in adult human toothpaste is thought to be poisonous to fuzzies, and ferrets
don’t know the meaning of “rinse and spit.” If you want to use human tooth-
paste, use toothpaste made especially for human toddlers.
To brush your ferret’s teeth, follow these steps:
1. Lift the gum and gently wipe his teeth with the toothbrush, using up
and down and back and forth movements.
2. Gently go over his gums with the toothbrush after you finish the teeth.
Pay particular attention to cleaning his gum line (where the teeth disap-
pear into the gums).
Patience and gentleness are the keys to successfully brushing your ferret’s
teeth. After all, you’re not sanding down old paint. Some ferrets tolerate
having their teeth brushed after a while, but others may have to be scruffed.
Use the method that’s the least stressful on you and your ferret.
159
Chapter 9: Cleaning Time: Not All Ferret Fun and Games

Breaking Out the Hairbrush
Some people choose to brush their fuzzies’ fur as they would a dog’s or cat’s.
Other people skip this grooming step; maybe they’re lazy or just find it
unnecessary. There’s no disadvantage to brushing as long as you use a soft
brush and you’re gentle, but brushing does have two main advantages:
 Helps to keep your ferret’s coat clean and free of debris
 Removes loose fur — an especially important thing because fuzzies are
prone to hairballs, and hairballs can be fatal
If you decide to brush your fuzzbutt, use a soft brush designed for kittens,
rabbits, or other small mammals. These brushes generally are shorter bris-
tled and just hard enough to remove loose fur without irritating sensitive
skin. Stroke the brush in the same direction as the fur. Most furkids don’t
want to remain motionless for very long, so be aware that brushing can be a
quick adventure. Some ferrets, however, enjoy this part of the grooming
process and come to look forward to it.

aring for your ferret means much more than providing her with fresh
food and water. It’s more than providing a roof over her head and clean-
ing up her poop, and it’s even more than taking her for regular vet trips. Care
goes way beyond that, which is where many pet owners fail in their responsi-
bilities. Whether you own a dog, cat, bird, bunny, or ferret, your job is to keep
your pet’s life interesting and filled with enriching stimuli. In fact, her physi-
cal and psychological well-being depend on it!
Ferrets are as intelligent as small primates of the same body (and brain) size,
which is proof that they need a lot of action-packed play and exploring time
in a ferret-safe environment. Without a regular supply of stimulation, ferrets
can become cage-crazy or depressed. Mentally, they can lose interest in their
surroundings and their desire to explore or play. They may begin chewing on
their cage bars and digging out their litter and food more frequently — basi-
cally, spending most of their time trying to find a way out of jail. Physically,
they can become unfit and frequently will fall asleep on the hammock while
watching reruns of old sitcoms. More importantly, the stress of having no
enrichment can cause disease, such as ulcers, or make existing diseases
worse.

162
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
This chapter is all about enrichment for both you and your ferret. I take the
mystery out of the topic by further explaining what it is, why it’s necessary,
and what it does for ferrets. I try to give you enough information on ferret
enrichment activities so that you can keep your ferret on her toes and even
come up with your own enrichment ideas. I also guide you through some of
the clubs, events, and resources available to you as a ferret owner. Take
advantage of them. Here’s to a happy and healthy life together!
Why Is Enrichment Necessary?
Like humans, ferrets possess an array of complex senses that need to be exer-
cised on a daily basis. Imagine staring at the same wall for weeks on end. The
sound of the same song playing over and over, which eventually becomes
silent as you tune out the repetitiveness. Putting together the same puzzle so
many times that you can do it in your sleep and you no longer enjoy the pic-
ture it creates. Your daily ration of macaroni and cheese squishing tastelessly
in your mouth. You find some amusement in flinging it off your fork and watch-
ing it glob on the bare wall in front of you. The only smell filling your isolated
room emanates from the toilet, which gets flushed every once in a while. Sound
like torture? It is, and your ferret finds it excruciating as well. As a responsible
ferret owner, your duty is to prevent your ferret from experiencing such
depressing boredom. This presents quite a challenge to owners, because fer-
rets realize monotony in their surroundings rather quickly.
Humans tell our ferrets what and sometimes when to eat. We clean their
cages and provide them with sleeping quarters. We introduce cagemates and
take cagemates away. We medicate. We bathe. We groom. Humans are the ulti-
mate ferret dictators, making most of their pets’ life decisions for them. The
basic goal of environmental enrichment is to get animals to interact with
their environments, using their natural skills and behaviors, and to stimulate
all their senses. You want to give your ferret something to think about, give
her choices, and help her feel in control. Enrichment can also provide exer-
cise, and it definitely relieves boredom.
What Does Enrichment Do for Ferrets?
What does enrichment do for ferrets? First of all, enrichment feels good!
Enrichment can mean play! And what is play if not an activity that makes us feel
good? This is a simple definition for an activity that utilizes a set of highly devel-
oped and often complicated skills. Dancing, chasing, dooking, hopping aimlessly
in many directions at once . . . all are fun, and all feel wonderful! If play makes
your ferret feel good, what’s wrong with that? Enriching your ferret’s life is 

certainly better than risking cage stress and boredom that can make her feel
bad and adopt a negative outlook. But enrichment does even more than make
you and your ferret feel good, as I explain the following sections.
Relieves boredom and stress
Boredom can be a major cause of stress for fuzzies. Ferrets are physically 
and emotionally sensitive to their surroundings. They need stimulation and
enrichment to keep from getting bored. And boy, do they get bored easily!
Facilitates bonding
Although their natural tendency is to live a solitary life, ferrets are more
likely than not to enjoy the company of other ferrets and humans — and even
other types of pets. Through social enrichment, you can teach your ferret
important social skills. Viewing each other much as they would littermates,
ferrets brought together by adoption enjoy chasing each other and being
chased. They rough and tumble and even steal from each other, testing their
limits to the max. Sometimes, cats and dogs will partake in the ferret play as
well, fostering camaraderie and trust between species.
Enrichment is extremely important when it comes to bonding with humans,
too! Enrichment activities are the only true ways for your ferret to get to
know you and for you to get to know your ferret. Enrichment will increase
comfort levels, establish limits, build trust, and strengthen bonds. Even a
timid or aggressive ferret will build up more confidence and trust through
enrichment activities.
Bonding enrichments also can help parents solve the problem of how to get
their children interested in ferrets. Children often persuade their parents to
get a ferret but soon get bored with it, and the ferret languishes in a cage for
long periods of time. Bonding enrichments can help tie a child to a ferret,
which is great for all involved.
Keeps their senses alive and well
A ferret’s every sense needs to be exercised routinely and equally to keep her
sharp. Ferrets have an exceptional sense of smell; you’ll frequently see your
fuzzy with her nose to the ground as she sniffs out new and unusual things.
Enrichment activities that call on this sense are great fun. Ferrets also benefit
from games such as tag or pouncing, where they rely on their eyesight to
hone in on victims. And what about touch, taste, and hearing? All very
163
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

heightened senses that long to be tested. Keeping all this in mind, the
possibilities for sensory enrichment are endless. (For more details on a
ferret’s senses, check out the section “Understanding Your Ferret’s Senses.”)
Helps to curb negative behaviors
Every ferret behavior is based on biological, medical, or psychological fac-
tors. A bored ferret can be a problematic ferret! So when you hear the term
“cage crazy,” you can assume it means just that! A few symptoms of cage
craziness include
 Nipping or biting
 Gnawing on cage bars
 Fabric chewing
 Pacing
This acting out is her way of letting you know that she’s unhappy. She’s
attempting to relieve some of the stress brought on by what’s lacking in her
life. This ferret needs some enrichment, stat!
Keeps the flab at bay
Lack of exercise or physical play contributes to chubbiness, whether you’re
talking about a human or a ferret. Physical enrichment activities burn calo-
ries and keep muscles toned and in shape. The ferret in its natural state is an
extremely muscular critter, and you want to keep yours that way. Get your
ferret out and exploring!
Encourages curiosity and creative 
problem solving
Enrichment is brain food! Enrichment not only increases the number of brain
cells a ferret has, but also helps her brain recover from injury. Ferrets are
both curious and adept problem-solvers. Providing enrichment will challenge
your ferret by introducing new problems and encouraging the discovery of
solutions.
164
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Helps to keep bones, muscles, organs, 
and joints healthy
Physical enrichment improves joint and ligament performance, builds
muscle, and increases strength. It also helps your ferret to build endurance
when you’re chasing her to retrieve your belongings! When humans exercise
regularly, they preserve bone mass and increase bone density, because bones
respond to mechanical stress by adding more bone tissue. It’s likely your
ferret gains benefits in this same way. Muscles and organs are exercised
during physical enrichment and fed oxygen-rich blood, making them stronger
and less prone to damage and infection. As they say, use them or lose them!
Improves heart health and 
overall circulation
Exercise and play gets a ferret’s heart beating faster, thus facilitating rapid
transportation of oxygen-rich blood and nutrients to all organs and areas of
the body. As your ferret exercises, she engages in deep, rhythmic breathing,
which assists her lungs in developing greater capacity and allows her to take
in sufficient oxygen to nourish her cells. This is called cardiovascular fitness.
Enrichment play can also increase the size of her tiny blood vessels and
improve the efficiency of the blood-delivery system. Physical play not only
conditions the heart and lungs to work more efficiently during play, but also
helps them work more efficiently during rest.
Makes humans smile and laugh
Ferrets are the ultimate in play therapy! It’s hard not to find ferret antics
worthy of giggles and smiles. All humans need to put aside time to laugh and
have fun. Interacting with your ferret is a quick fix that rapidly dissipates anx-
iety, even if momentarily. It’s a known fact that interacting with a pet in a pos-
itive way can reduce overall stress levels and lower blood pressure. And if
that isn’t a good enough reason to play with your ferret, how about the fact
that she also giggles and smiles watching silly humans play along? You and
your ferret will benefit from having fun!
165
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

Understanding Your Ferret’s Senses
The pads on a ferret’s paws are extremely sensitive. His face and nose are
ticklish. His whiskers dance at the slightest sensation. His taste buds long to
be awakened and stimulated with new tastes. Ferrets have an acute sense of
hearing. They can hear a bag of treats being opened from across the house!
That’s right! Ferret senses are alive and well just like yours and mine.
Understanding each sense will allow you to help your ferret live an enriching
life. This section will teach you about the ferret’s five senses. Every enrich-
ment activity you implement will involve one or more of these senses. The
more senses you stimulate, the better the enrichment.
Hearing
Ferrets have hearing that’s at least comparable to a dog, meaning that it’s
excellent and highly developed. Reports indicate they can even hear frequen-
cies as low as elephants can. Ferrets hear best in the range of 8 to 12 kilo-
hertz (kHz). You can safely assume that your ferret can hear below and above
the human ability.
Smelling
A foot of mud isn’t enough to keep an innocent frog safe from a ferret,
because the ferret’s sense of smell is exceptionally strong. Her nose is so sen-
sitive that she can likely sniff out water, which helps to explain how blind fer-
rets have little difficulty making their way to water bottles.
Unfortunately, a ferret’s keen sense of smell can also be a disadvantage. The
ferret’s sense of smell causes her extreme olfactory imprinting — when a
ferret “imprints” on food items by the age of 6 months old. This means that if
she hasn’t been exposed to the food by that age, she doesn’t recognize it as
food. When young, a ferret’s smell cells that aren’t exposed to specific types
of odor wither away and die. Afterwards, because the ferret can’t smell the
food, she simply doesn’t recognize it as something good to eat. (For more on
this phenomenon, see the following section.)
Tasting
Experts and ferret owners don’t know much about the ferret’s sense of taste,
but because it’s closely tied to the sense of smell, they assume that ferrets
also have a highly developed sense of taste. You’ll certainly find that your
ferret favors some tastes over others.
166
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Because taste and smell are so closely tied together, you should expose a
young ferret to as many food items as possible while she’s young. That way,
her smell cells will be more diversified and she’ll be able to recognize more
items as food when she grows into adulthood. This will allow you to provide
a varied, free-choice diet and will give her a healthier life through adulthood
(see Chapter 8).
Seeing
A common misconception is that the ferret’s eyesight is exceptionally poor.
Although the resolution (the ability to see fine detail) of a ferret’s vision isn’t
as fine as a human’s, and a ferret probably only sees limited colors — living
in a world of grays, for instance — ferret vision isn’t all that bad for a species
that has adapted to see in the dark. Much of what’s considered bad vision is
probably an adaptation to living in cages, making ferrets appear more near-
sighted than they actually are.
Touching
Ferrets have evolved to live in a dark, subterranean world. Consequently,
they have a large number of specialized hairs sensitive to touch found
around their mouths, on their necks, and even on their forearms! These spe-
cial hairs illuminate the way so they can move through dark areas with no
light.
A ferret’s foot pads also are very sensitive to touch; they have small hairs
that probably help the ferret find her way in the dark. The hairs may reduce
sound as well, helping her evade predators and sneak up on prey.
Recommended Enrichment Activities 
for You and Your Fuzzy
Many activities will allow you to have safe, enriching fun with your ferret —
as long as you’re fun-loving, creative, and well-prepared. In the following sec-
tions, I cover some of the enrichment possibilities for you. First, I give you
pointers on setting up appropriate areas for your activities, and then I tell
you about the activities themselves. The enrichment activities I present stim-
ulate any of the ferret’s five senses: smell, vision, touch, taste, and hearing.
167
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

A ferret’s toy chest can quickly become full of all sorts of toys and miscella-
neous objects. To keep it together, you can come up with a simple storage
system that works for you. You can manage toys and enrichment items by
storing them in size-appropriate bins or ferret-proof plastic containers. You
can label the bins according to toy type, manner of enrichment (hearing,
smelling, tasting, touching, or seeing), or even by weekly rotation. It also
helps to keep one labeled bin aside to hold all items that need to be cleaned
(for more on cleaning toys, see Chapter 9).
Organizing your ferret’s play areas
A ferret’s outdoor play area is essentially an enclosed, ferret-proofed place
where she can run and play — a place that’s safe from escape or predation
from other animals. It should have all the following items for enrichment 
purposes:
 Soil for digging
 Water for splashing
 Objects for climbing
 Novel items for exploration
 Tubes for running
 Dens for hiding and sleeping
Of paramount importance is ferret-proofing. Unless you’re absolutely certain
your ferret can’t escape and that a predator can’t get in, you shouldn’t leave
the ferret alone when outdoors.
You must remember that ferrets are excellent diggers and can dig themselves
out of most play areas. They’re also excellent climbers, so you must confine
any climbing opportunities to the middle of the play area with no chance for
escape. (People like using wood climbing tools, because wood is difficult to
climb.) Many people will line the bottoms of their outdoor play areas with
wire and cover them with dirt to prevent digging escape. Other people
choose to dig out the perimeter of the play areas and bury cement cinder
blocks two to three feet deep in the ground. This option certainly stops the
ferret from digging out, or at least gives you time to fill in the holes after they
get that deep. You can always continue putting the cinder blocks above
ground and then build a structure on them. The design of the play area is
your choice, but it must be escape-proof and predation-proof.
A ferret’s indoor play area is usually a room designated for the ferret. It may
be just for the ferret, or it may be a common living area. It should be well
ferret-proofed, and preferably tiled (see Chapter 6 on ferret-proofing). You can
bring a little of the outdoors inside by providing a dirt dig box, a small pool of
water, or a box of leaves, but the cleanup is obviously a little more involved.
168
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Movement and physical-exercise activities
This section provides a couple specific enrichment activities that require
physical exertion and movement. Other activities that fall under this cate-
gory include play activities, leashed walks, wrestling, and anything that
causes the ferret to work her muscles.
Dirt galore
Cater to your ferret’s desire to dig by giving her a big bin of topsoil or play
sand in her play area. Playtime may get messy, but it’s well worth the effort!
Just look at the smile on your fuzzy’s face (behind the dirt moustache).
Hide some tiny treasures in the dirt or sand pit for extra enrichment, and let
her dig away. And if your dig box is outside, consider burying some earth-
worms in there. If your ferret is daring, she may enjoy the worms as tasty
treats.
Ferret cheerleading
Invest in some cheap, plastic, multi-colored pom-poms, which you can find in
most party supply stores. (Black and white would be the best contrast!) Now
you’re ready to try the following exercises:
 Dance the poms above your ferret’s head and watch her dance and jump
up to catch them.
 Race them along the floor to get your ferret to chase them or even ride
them.
 Wiggle the poms in your ferret’s face and watch her go crazy!
You can lightly scent the poms with perfume or scented food oils for added
enticement and enrichment. This meets visual, smelling, hearing, and touch-
ing enrichments, assuming you complete all the exercises in this activity.
Social-development activities
This section presents some enrichment activities that relate to the social
needs and development of your ferret. Other common types of social enrich-
ments include face washing, grooming, petting, feeding by hand, and cud-
dling. (For more on grooming routines, head to Chapter 9.)
The washcloth rubdown
The washcloth rubdown is one of the most effective grooming/bonding meth-
ods, but it takes a little practice. All you need is a small, damp (not wet),
warm washcloth. Starting at your ferret’s face and working your way back
across her body, rub your ferret with the washcloth. Move in the direction of
169
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

her fur. You may need to rinse and warm your washcloth again during the
activity to keep it fresh. Don’t forget her belly, and particularly her bottom
and genitals.
What you’re doing is mocking her mom’s behavior. This enrichment activity
is not only a great way to bond with your ferret, but also a good way to keep
her clean.
Sack ’o ferret
A great social enrichment activity is to get a bonding pouch or a sack and
place your ferret inside. Carry her around while you do household chores or
just sit with her and watch television or read a book. I usually have one hand
in the pouch so that I can stay in contact with a ferret and play with her. Most
ferret sacks and pouches have convenient straps so that you can hang them
around your neck or over your shoulder.
Food-related activities
Enrichment activities that exploit the ferret’s desire to eat can include giving
bits of “forbidden” foods, such as a single lick of ice cream; tastes of human
food, such as a tiny piece of pot roast; or even something unfamiliar. Some
examples of ferret-safe foods include meat-based baby food and the creative
ferret recipes listed in Chapter 25.
One useful food-related activity is the stink trail. Take a small piece of meat
and “dab” it on the floor, making a trail to a hiding place. Be creative and
make the trail zig-zag or go around the leg of a table. You can even use per-
fume as the scent and go up the corner of a couch. Watch your ferret follow
the scent trail to the end!
Just the smell or experience of investigating food is enriching to a ferret, so
even if your ferret doesn’t eat the food, it isn’t a failure of the enrichment.
Training exercises
This section presents some enrichment activities that encourage the training
of your ferret to perform certain behaviors; others discourage your fuzzy from
certain activities. Mostly, these activities are tricks (do’s) and trainings
(don’ts) that stimulate all your ferret’s senses and help you out in the process!
Some fuzzies are cautious and anxious creatures; don’t traumatize your ferret
by insisting that she learn a certain training exercise if that trick obviously
bothers her. Other ferrets will learn trick after trick. They may even teach you
a few while still leaving room to invent new tricks of their own. Fuzzies are
individual characters with unique personalities. All are extremely intelligent,
170
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

but some have less interest in learning pet tricks. Having your ferret act like a
ferret should be delightful enough.
I beg your pardon?
The easiest trick to teach a ferret is to sit up and beg. The action comes natu-
rally because ferrets often have to stand up high and peek for the things they
want to pilfer. When your furball learns this trick, she may start running in
front of you every chance she gets to beg for a treat, doggie-style. Teaching
this trick requires that you have a favorite treat and a human hand — prefer-
ably attached to the rest of a human body:
1. Sit on the floor with a treat in your hand or Linatone on your finger.
2. Reach straight away from your body and let your ferret sniff the treat
so she knows that it’s there.
You can even give her a tiny taste.
3. Slowly raise your hand until she has to raise herself to reach the treat.
Don’t let her rest her front paws on your lap or grab your hand. If she
does, gently nudge her away or move farther from her and start over.
The idea is to get her to do the trick without cheating.
4. While she reaches up to get it, use the command you want to stick
with, such as “Up,” “Beg,” or “Sit up.”
Choose a simple word or phrase and be consistent with it.
When your ferret begins to associate the verbal command with the treat,
start using only the hand motion to prompt the action. Note: Deaf ferrets
can’t read lips, but they can read body language and beg for treats just as
frequently.
Scooter, I think your human is calling
Many people have taught their ferrets to come a-runnin’ when they call their
names. Teaching this trick is almost the same as conditioning ferrets to
respond to a squeaky toy or another noise with a treat in mind. However,
many people proclaim that each of their ferrets knows her name separately
from the others and that some even recognize the names of their cagemates.
You have a few ways to teach your fuzzy her name and have her respond to
it. Repetition and reward play the biggest roles. Here’s one method that
works well:
1. During playtime, grab a treat and then call your ferret’s name.
If she doesn’t even notice that a noise came out of your mouth, make
visual contact with her and call her name again.
2. Crouch down and let her know that you have something good to show
her, all while calling her name.
171
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

3. If she appears interested and comes toward you, reward the action
with a small taste of the treat.
4. Move farther away and call her name again, repeating the process
several times; soon, she should figure out that her name really means
a treat.
Treats are great motivators and help while you train your ferret. However, an
unfit fuzzy won’t come running when you call her name because she’ll be a
slug from all the yummy treats. Use verbal praise and lavish petting as alter-
nate rewards for desired behavior. Doing so will keep your ferret healthier,
and she may enjoy the surprise of the reward. You can also call your ferret’s
name and squeak her favorite toy at the same time. This combination usually
gets a furball’s attention, and she’ll come running to investigate. Keep calling
her name and using the toy as added motivation. After she masters the trick,
use the squeaky toy less and less until you cut it out completely.
You can make the trick tougher by hiding from your ferret and then calling
her. Ferrets are extremely intelligent creatures. If your ferret knows a positive
reward is at the end of the voice rainbow, she’ll listen for her name and come
bouncing eagerly to greet you.
Jumping through hoops
Having your ferret jump through hoops is a relatively easy trick to teach. All
you need is a small plastic hoop (or something similar) that measures about
1 foot in diameter. Here’s one teaching method that works:
1. Hold the hoop upright on the floor between you and your fuzzy.
2. Show her a treat to entice her through the hoop; when she starts walk-
ing through to get the treat, say “Jump” and then reward her when
she passes through.
At this point, she has no clue what the heck you’re talking about. She
thinks you’re nuts and just wants the treat. In time, though, she’ll make
the connection between the hoop, the command, and the treat.
3. Gradually raise the hoop and try to entice her to jump through on
command, using the treat during the early stages.
You can get a ferret to jump through the hoop in several ways. Some fer-
rets will just jump through as you raise the hoop and say the command.
Others will go under or around the hoop. If you have a difficult ferret, sit
in a corner or narrow passageway to make it necessary for her to pass
through the hoop. Always hold the treat up high so she has to look up
and over the hoop rim to get to it. And don’t forget to say “Jump” when
the ferret passes through the hoop.
172
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

After your ferret masters walking through the hoop and learning the
“Jump” command, you can try to place her on a slightly raised platform,
like a pet carrier, and place the hoop in front of it off the ground. Raise
the treat up high and say “Jump” as she hops through. This can help get
your fuzzy airborne faster.
Several creative methods can teach this trick to your ferret. Tossing your
ferret through the hoop and hollering “Jump,” however, isn’t a good way. Be
gentle and creative, and pour on the praise for a job well done.
Roll over, Beethoven
A treat (such as a piece of cereal or piece of meat) can work wonders with
teaching your ferret to roll over on command. Some fuzzies don’t like to be
placed on their backs and rolled over, so your ferret may give you a hard time
at first. Not to worry; as usual, I know several ways to teach your fuzzy that
have been successful in the past! Following is one method that works well:
1. Hold a treat in your hand and allow your fuzzy to lick it.
The treat will distract her while you gently roll her over.
2. While still holding the treat, move it in a circular motion over your
ferret’s head while you roll her over.
Many times at this point, a ferret’s head will roll and her body will natu-
rally follow as she tries to keep up with the treat.
3. As she’s rolling over — either on her own or with your gentle help —
say “Over” or “Roll over.”
Be consistent with the term you use.
In the beginning, you may have to roll over a stubborn fuzzy 100 percent of
the way. Eventually, you can taper off to a three-quarter push, to a half push,
to a slight nudge. Your fuzzy should need only the motivation of a treat and
the command by the time she has learned what you want her to do. When
she associates rolling over with treats and affection, you may find her run-
ning in front of you and rolling over to get attention, be picked up, or get a
treat. It’s quite amusing.
Using the circular hand motion is great for teaching deaf carpet sharks that
can’t hear commands. They simply roll over as you give them the hand
signal.
Diving for treasures
The diving for treasures trick is pretty cool and fun to watch, but to pull it off
you need a ferret that’s comfortable with water and likes to snorkel around
otter-style. Here’s how you teach your ferret to dive for treasure:
173
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

1. Find a treat that sinks and is easy to spot underwater.
A small piece of meat or a 1⁄2 of a blueberry is perfect for this trick.
2. Get a large, empty litter box or something similar and fill it with
water.
3. Place the treat in your open palm and rest your hand on the water’s
surface. Allow your ferret to grab the treat.
4. Repeat Step 3, but this time lower your hand just enough to soak the
treat. Again, let your ferret grab it.
5. As your fuzzy gets used to this trick, lower your hand more and more
until your ferret is (voluntarily) submerging her head in the water to
get the treat.
6. When your fuzzy snorkeler becomes a pro at bobbing for goodies, toss
the treat into the tub and watch her dive in.
If she doesn’t dive on in, bring the treat up from the deep and show it to
her in the palm of your hand. As she sticks her head in to get it, drop the
treat to the bottom again. She should go directly to it and snarf it up.
Using novel objects in activities
A novel object is one that the ferret is unfamiliar with. Ferrets love unfamiliar
objects and always seem to favor them over anything else. New smells are
the most important characteristic, but ferrets also enjoy new textures,
shapes, graphic designs, tastes, and locations. An empty box is a great start-
ing point, for example. The box itself can be novel for a day; turning it upside
down makes it novel once again. Cut a hole in the side to make it novel after
your ferret loses interest. Filling it with cut grass increases the novelty
greatly. You get the idea. The following sections present a couple more
enrichment activities that feature novel objects.
The nice thing about novel objects is that you don’t have to spend a lot of
money on them or get fancy with them. Ferrets don’t care. Be creative with
simple, safe household objects. The aforementioned box works well. A bin
filled with crumpled newspaper (the hearing/touching senses) or an old boot
(smelling) is a novel object that costs next to nothing.
Crinkle tub
Fill a bin with crinkled balls of newspaper and place your ferret inside. You’ll
be tickled pink watching her bounce around and play in reaction to the crin-
kling sounds the paper makes. The more noise she can create, the more she’ll
dance. The paper also will feel new to her.
174
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Checkerboard wall
Give your ferret something new and exciting to look at by creating a black
and white checkerboard pattern for her cage or play area. You can use
Plexiglas or wood for the wall. You can paint the checkerboard with non-toxic
paint, or you can use tile or contact paper. It doesn’t have to be fancy. Fasten
or hang the board securely on the wall, low enough for the ferret to enjoy.
You can even hang some toys from it. The idea is to give your ferret some-
thing sharply contrasting to look at (black and white works well).
Finding Your Own Enrichment 
at Ferret Clubs
Joining a ferret club is a great way to meet other ferret owners who share
your love for ferrets. By staying in touch with ferret people, you can stay up
to date with health issues and current events. You may even develop friend-
ships that will last a lifetime! What could be better enrichment for you than
that?
Ferret clubs exist all over the world, so you should be able to find one rela-
tively close to home. Many clubs are associated with ferret shelters; others
operate independently of shelters simply out of a love for ferrets. Many ferret
clubs sponsor holiday parties with contests and games. Some even host
ferret shows or fundraisers for ferret-related causes (see the following sec-
tion for more on ferret shows).
Every dedicated ferret owner should consider joining a ferret club. For more
information on joining a club in your area, check out the following resources:
 www.ferretcentral.org/orgs.html
 www.ferret.org/links/shelters.shtm
Participating in Regional Shows, 
Club Shows, and Competitions
Life with a ferret doesn’t have to end at home! A whole ferret culture is out
there, waiting to be explored. Many people view ferret ownership as a liveli-
hood like no other. Some owners live and breathe ferrets, scheduling their
activities around playtime and feedings. But when, you may wonder, do these
owners get out to play? I’m glad you asked!
175
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

People love to show off their fuzzies, whether the pets are bare-furred or
dressed up in silly costumes. Ferret shows and fun matches are held all over,
and some are downright serious business. You can find out about ferret
shows by doing Internet searches or checking with the American Ferret
Association, which keeps an up-to-date listing of the major shows in the
United States. You can receive contact information for all shows and get com-
plete show packets with details on entering your ferret in classes and fun
matches. The following sections break down your show options and cover
fun matches and Ferret Symposiums.
So, you want to show your fuzzy?
The bottom line is this: Attending ferret shows, even as a spectator, is a 
great way to meet other fuzzy devotees and compare notes. You can swap
stupid and silly stories, most of which are related to the bodily functions of
ferrets. You can also learn about new medical treatments, get tips on over-
coming behavioral problems, and find out the best ways to ferret-proof. 
Also, many vendors set up booths and sell ferret-related items at shows,
ranging from food and ferret costumes to jewelry and other novelty items.
Of course, serious competition also exists. Rules, regulations, and standards
vary from organization to organization. If you decide to show your ferret,
know that she may be competing against generations of champions bred for
show by private breeders.
Depending on the type of show and which organization is sponsoring it —
such as The American Ferret Association (www.ferret.org) — you may
have many entry classes to choose from (which I explain in the next section).
And, depending on the show, points may be awarded to winners, just like
with dog shows. To reach a certain level or tier in the show circuit, your
ferret must obtain a certain number of points.
Naturally, looks aren’t all that matter. Personality is a plus. Although points are
awarded for clean ears, clean teeth, and a nice manicure, the most gorgeous,
well-groomed ferret won’t take home a ribbon if she bites the judge on the nose!
Preparing to bring home the blue ribbon
If you’re set on showing your ferret, you need to consider several things. First
up, what class will you enter?
 Specialty classes are for ferrets to be judged on color standards (see
Chapter 2 for a list of ferret colors). Some shows have extra specialty
classes for shelter ferrets, geriatric ferrets, and handicapped ferrets.
176
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

 Championship classes can be broken out by age, gender, and whether a
ferret has been altered. Judges consider mainly body proportion, coat
quality, and temperament. Champions may accrue points, making their
babies more valuable in the future.
The most important part of showing your ferret is making sure she’s up on
her maintenance and manners, which includes the following (see Chapter 9
for grooming tips):
 Temperament: Your ferret should be well-socialized and easily handled.
A biting ferret or a ferret that’s overly nervous around strangers should
be left at home, because a bite will almost always mean disqualification
(see Chapter 19).
 Nails: You should trim your ferret’s nails on a regular basis to keep the
quick from growing too long with the nail. Preferably, you should clip
your fuzzy’s nails a couple days before the show so that they can
smooth out, but don’t clip them all the way down to the quick. Judges
hate that. If you must clip them on the day of the show, make sure to use
a nail file to round off the nails.
 Ears: You can clean her ears the night before or the day of the show, but
be sure not to discolor the fur in and around the ears. There should be
no noticeable earwax.
 Teeth: Dirty teeth will cost you points or a ribbon. Having gingivitis or
red, inflamed gums also is a definite no-win situation! You should brush
your ferret’s teeth on a daily basis and take her to the vet for regular
cleanings. A good brushing on the day of the show is warranted, but
avoid scaling or scraping; you don’t want to present a ferret with bleed-
ing gums.
And have a toothbrush on hand to get food out of her teeth at the last
minute!
 Coat: Unless the show is during shedding season or your ferret has
adrenal gland disease, her coat should be soft and luxurious. Over-
bathing may leave her skin dry and flaky. A poor diet also will leave her
coat in bad condition. You can bathe your ferret the night before or the
day of the show, using a ferret shampoo or baby shampoo, as long as
you haven’t bathed her too recently. A teeny, weeny dab of Vaseline
between the toes is great for dry skin, as well.
After you have a class and your ferret is ready to present, you need to get
ready for the show. You need to remember to bring many things along on the
trip. The following list runs through your supplies:
 Your show packet and confirmation
 Proof of up-to-date vaccinations — canine distemper and rabies vaccina-
tions, specifically
177
Chapter 10: Enrichment: Yours and Your Ferret’s

Many shows also require proof that your ferret has tested negative for
ADV (Aleutian’s Disease). (For more on vaccinations and diseases, check
out the chapters in Part IV.)
 A large cage, carrier, and/or playpen for her to be able to move about
 Extra food, water bowl, bottles of water, Linatone
 Camera
 Small litter box and litter, scooper, paper towels
 Bedding and hammock
 Plastic bags, wet wipes, two to three bath towels, sanitary wipes
 Leash and harness
 A grooming kit (including nail clippers, nail file, Q-tips, cotton balls, ear
wash, tooth brush, hair brush, tissues, Vaseline, and coat-conditioner
spray)
 Extra money for shopping (the vendors are awesome!)
 Your ferret!
Fun matches
Fun matches are a great way to have fun with ferrets and their nutty humans.
Fun matches are light-hearted competitions held during shows and can often
be entered the day of a show. A little non-beauty related competition is good
for the soul. Fun match contests have nothing to do with how beautiful and
well-behaved your ferret is. They have everything to do with creativity, per-
sonality, and skill. Sometimes, it’s just fuzzy luck that wins out.
Fun match contests often include the following:
 The yawning contest: How many times can your ferret yawn in a set
amount of time? The yawningest ferret wins.
The first ferret competition I ever entered was a yawning contest, and
my Cookie took the prize. She yawned 7 times in 60 seconds. I was so
proud! Back then, you could scruff your ferret, which helped the yawns
come on. Most contests now rely on natural yawns. I could win that con-
test, but none of my current ferrets could.
 Tube racing: The first ferret out the other side of her tube wins.
Sometimes, you can use squeaky toys or stick your face through the exit
hole to encourage your ferret through. I think my Nikki once curled up
and went to sleep in a tube during a contest. We had to lift the tube and
slide her out. Can’t win ’em all!
178
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

 The great paper bag escape: Each ferret is placed into a large paper bag.
The top of the bag is neatly folded down. The first ferret to escape wins
the contest.
 Silly pet tricks: People come up with all sorts of silly ferret tricks, from
rolling over to jumping through hoops. Ferrets perform their tricks in
front of an audience and the audience favorite (judged by clapping) wins.
 The costume contest: Ferrets are dressed up in unique and often
adorable costumes, from chefs and doctors to geisha girls and balleri-
nas. Also judged by the audience’s clapping.
Annual Ferret Symposiums
In the fall of 2000, the very first Ferret Symposium was held in Toronto.
Thanks to Randy Belair, president of the Ferret Aid Society in Toronto, the
Ferret Symposium offered the North American ferret community its first ever
chance to participate in an all-ferret educational weekend. Speakers included
well-known ferret veterinarians, shelter workers, and ferret-knowledgeable
individuals. Vendors kept shoppers busy, and the entertainment on hand
encouraged people to gather and get to know each other. Randy’s brainchild
paved the way for other wonderful Ferret Symposiums that have since come
and gone, and more are in the planning stages. Cities such as Las Vegas,
St. Louis, Portland, and Atlanta have come to know the dedication and spirit
of ferret owners.
Every dedicated ferret owner should consider attending a Ferret Symposium
to learn about the latest health-care issues and medical treatments, as well as
husbandry issues and other ferret-related topics. The speakers are phenome-
nal; the camaraderie is unbeatable; and the weekend is unforgettable. To
learn more about upcoming Ferret Symposiums, visit The International Ferret
Congress Web site at www.ferretcongress.org.
Internet Clubs and Lists
The Internet is home to a wealth of ferret information. Some of the informa-
tion is outstanding. Some is okay. Some isn’t so great. Weeding through the
good, the bad, and the ugly can be difficult, and I’m no expert when it comes
to surfing the Web. It can be a scary place, so be careful and choosy about
what you want to believe.
Well-recognized Internet clubs and lists are great places to start when it
comes to gathering online information about ferrets. Patiently observe what
goes on there so you can quickly learn who’s been around the block and who
the respected authorities are. I mention two wonderful lists in the following
sections that should get you off to a great start.

Ferret Mailing List (FML)
The Ferret Mailing List (FML) has been proudly running since 1987! It’s a fan-
tastic forum dedicated to the domestic or pet ferret. Any ferret-related topic
is welcome, and anyone can join. Its 3,000+ member list includes pet owners,
veterinarians, breeders, shelter managers, ferret-owner wannabes, and, of
course, me! Moderated by superhuman Bill Gruber (also known as BIG) to
keep posts on-topic and clean, the list is distributed in a digest-style format
every morning and great information is posted daily. Currently, 15 years of
archives are available by user-friendly searches.
To subscribe to the Ferret Mailing List, please e-mail ferret-l-

the word “subscribe,” or a note asking to subscribe.
Ferret Health List (FHL)
The Ferret Health List (FHL) is a phenomenal list founded by Christopher
Bennett, a special person who thought it would be a great idea to have one
place to gather to talk ferret health. His idea took off, and FHL’s membership
is steadily increasing. Today, his legacy is carried on by some other special
people. Moderated by veterinarians and ferret-health-knowledgeable people,
FHL’s topics are limited to ferret health issues. Anyone can join the list, and
posts are addressed frequently by vets or other people well-known in the
ferret community.

Have Ferret, May Travel
In This Chapter
 Preparing to take your fuzzy on vacation
 Reviewing your travel alternatives
 Exploring alternatives to taking fuzzy with you
S
ome people think a vacation gives them time away from the kids and pets.
Others wouldn’t dare leave their loved ones behind — human or ferret.
For me, lugging my many fuzzbutts to my dream destination just doesn’t
seem feasible or relaxing. It’s difficult enough taking a spouse along for the
trip! (Of course, you can always decide to leave your spouse behind and take
off with your fuzzies.)
This chapter deals specifically with the sensitive subject of travel decisions.
Do you travel with your ferret or leave him behind in someone else’s care?
You should take certain things into consideration when making this decision;
much of it depends on where you’re going and for how long. The decision
you make is personal, of course; but whatever you choose, this chapter has
you covered.
Fuzzy Is Going on Vacation!
If you decide that your fuzzy deserves a vacation too, or if you just can’t bear
to leave him behind, you need to do some pre-trip investigating and prepar-
ing. Depending on how you want to travel and where you’re traveling to,
taking your ferret may be a somewhat simple task, or it may be a major
ordeal. No matter what, the health and safety of your ferret should be your
utmost concern.
Traveling, even comfortably, is very stressful on your fuzzy. If your ferret
accompanies you in your travels, the trip should be as relaxing as possible
for both of you. This means giving your fuzzy ample playtime and attention
as usual — if not more. It also means providing a comfortable cage to live in
while away from home. Don’t keep him in a tiny carrier. After all, if the trip

182
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 
won’t be a vacation for your ferret, too, you should leave him behind where
he can at least have familiar surroundings (see the later section “Leaving
Your Furball in Good Hands”). Also, provide plenty of favorite toys to keep
him amused and preoccupied when he isn’t sleeping. As an extra bonus for
keeping him busy, he won’t be dooking, “Are we there yet? Are we there yet?”
Checking ahead
Before you leave on your trip, you need to make sure that your fuzzy is wel-
come at your destination — especially if you’ll be staying in a hotel. Sneaking
a ferret into a ferret-free hotel may mean an extra charge for you or an expul-
sion, leaving you nowhere to go. Be smart. Likewise, don’t show up on your
Aunt Mary’s doorstep with ferret in hand without getting permission first. A
call from your car a mile from her house isn’t what I have in mind, either.
Being considerate of other people helps ensure that your ferret will be
treated well on his vacation.
If you’ll be staying at a hotel that allows ferrets (and other pets, for that
matter), you may be required to pay a little extra for your room or put down
a refundable deposit to cover possible damage. Hey, there’s a reason why it’s
becoming more and more difficult to find pet-friendly hotels! Most hotels are
afraid of the mess that some pets leave behind. Keep your hotel pet-friendly
by cleaning up after your ferret before you leave. (See the following section
for tips on what you need to bring to ensure a clean and healthy trip.)
Many people forget (or don’t know) that their beloved fuzzies aren’t welcome
in all cities and states. If your destination is a ferret-free zone (see Chapter 3
for info on these places), leave your fuzzy behind. If you’ll be passing through
a ferret-free zone on the way to your destination, consider what may happen
if you get pulled over for a traffic violation, get in a car accident, or if your
ferret suddenly requires medical treatment. Although the odds of being dis-
covered on a simple journey through a ferret-free zone are remote, check the
ferret laws of the towns you’ll be passing through just to be sure. The penalty
can vary from a simple warning to the confiscation of your beloved pet. It’s
up to you to chance it or drive a different route. No matter the situation,
though, keep a health certificate and proof of rabies vaccination on hand.
Packing the necessities
Traveling with your ferret will be relatively easy, as long as you pack the nec-
essary items to make his journey (and yours) comfortable. Whether you’ll be
going across the state line or heading to the other side of the country, you
need the following basic items:

 Your ferret’s first-aid kit (see Chapter 12 for a list of what should go in
this kit)
Be sure to include an appropriate supply of medication that your ferret
may need.
 Proof of current rabies vaccination and a current health certificate
issued by your veterinarian
 A lasting supply of ferret food and a water bottle (see Chapter 8 for more
on feeding your fuzzy)
 A pet carrier or travel cage to keep your ferret safe
The bigger the travel cage, the better — especially if you’re going on a
long trip. If you must travel with a small carrier, bring along a decent-sized
cage for the duration of the vacation. Don’t keep your ferret cooped up.
 A harness and leash
 A litter box and litter
 Fluffy, snoozy bedding (don’t forget to pack a change of bedding, too)
 Cleaning supplies to clean up after your ferret; wet wipes, plastic bags,
and so on (see Chapter 9)
 Toys, toys, toys
Don’t give your ferret any sedatives or tranquilizers of any sort while travel-
ing. If you think your ferret must have a sedative, leave him at home or take
one yourself and continue on with your travel plans!
On the Road or Flying High
We’ve come a long way since the horse and buggy! Getting to where you need
to be has become much easier, whether you travel by plane, train, or automo-
bile. Heck, you can even travel by ship, too! In this section, I talk about the
most frequently used means of transportation — the scenic road trip and the
zippy plane ride — so that you can make sure your ferret is comfortable and
safe during his travels.
Road trip!
If you have the time (or if the thought of taking to the friendly skies makes you
poof), you may decide to partake in a scenic road trip. Or perhaps the trip
isn’t long enough to warrant hopping on a plane. Although a road trip can be
fun, you need to prepare for many things when driving with your ferret.
183
Chapter 11: Have Ferret, May Travel

Road trip do’s
When you decide to travel with your ferret (or children for that matter), you
make a commitment to tend to his physical and emotional needs throughout
the trip. This can be quite demanding. The following list presents some
things you must do while on the road with your ferret:
 Do keep your ferret in his carrier or cage to prevent accidents when
you’re driving.
 Do make frequent rest stops and take the time to harness/leash your
ferret for brisk walks. Also, resist the urge to let strangers handle your
already stressed-out and excited fuzzy during stops. Stress is one of the
conditions that can lead to unpredictable ferret behavior.
 Do keep a copy of your ferret’s rabies vaccination certificate and med-
ical records.
 Do offer your ferret water frequently during trips. A hanging water bottle
or bowl in the carrier will continually drip or spill from the jostling.
 Do keep your car cool and well-ventilated.
 Do remember to medicate your ferret, if necessary, at scheduled times.
If you’re crazy enough to take a long, hot, summer road trip in a vehicle with-
out air conditioning, bring along a cooler with several two-liter plastic bottles
of frozen water. Keep one of the frozen bottles wrapped in a towel and in your
pet’s travel carrier to keep him cool.
Ferrets are master escape artists. Take into consideration that your ferret
may be able to get out of his cage or carrier in your vehicle. Also, a child or
spouse may let him out without anyone knowing — a particularly scary situa-
tion if you drive with the windows down. And before slamming that car door
shut, be sure your ferret is safe in his carrier where he belongs. In a car door
versus ferret situation, the car door always wins.
Road trip don’ts
Driving with your ferret can be a challenge, and sometimes pets are the last
thing on your mind. It’s important to recognize the dangers associated with
traveling with your ferret and be diligent in tending to his needs. You can pre-
vent most accidents by using common sense or learning from others. 
The following list presents some no no’s for road trips with your fuzzy:
 Don’t leave your ferret in the vehicle unattended when the temperature
is extreme.
 Don’t leave him in the vehicle overnight while you snooze comfortably
in a motel.
184
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

 Don’t leave your ferret in his carrier with his harness or collar on.
 Don’t pack your ferret in the trunk. Besides being cruel, this treatment
can kill him if the temperature is unstable or carbon monoxide leaks in.
 Don’t fasten your caged ferret with the rest of your luggage on top of
your vehicle. (You’d think common sense would prevail here . . .)
 Don’t travel with a very sick, old, or pregnant ferret. The stress of travel-
ing may jeopardize the already stressed fuzzy’s health.
Taking to the friendly skies
Some extra requirements and considerations go along with traveling by air
with your fuzzy. In addition to packing the necessary goods (see the earlier
section “Packing the necessities”), you need to work on a couple pre-flight
tasks:
 Check with the airline to find out about any specific rules and regula-
tions regarding traveling with pets. Since 9/11, traveling with animals
has become more restricted. Every airline is different. Most no longer
allow in-cabin pets, for instance. Although each airline has its own set of
rules about flying with pets, you can be sure of the following typical
requirements (be sure to follow all rules, including any that I may not
cover here):
• You must make a prior reservation for your pet. Be sure to confirm
the arrangement a couple days before takeoff. (Note: Airlines issue
an additional charge for in-cabin travel — that is, the under-the-
seat method — as opposed to cargo.)
I advise pet owners to always try to take their pets with them in
the cabin whenever possible. If you must fly your ferret via cargo,
check with different airlines to see whether you can check in your
ferret at the ticket counter; if not, you may have to make an addi-
tional stop at the cargo terminal. Try to choose an airline that
allows checking at the ticket counter so you decrease the odds of
your ferret being sent on a different flight.
• Your vet must issue a health certificate no more than ten days
before takeoff. The certificate indicates that your ferret is current
on vaccinations and is healthy and fit for travel. (Keep proof of his
current rabies vaccination on hand, too.)
• You must provide an airline-approved carrier. If traveling in-cabin,
your fuzzy’s carrier must be small enough to fit beneath a seat.
Also, your pet must remain in the carrier while on board. (Always
call the airline to clarify what its definition of an “airline-approved”
carrier is.)
185
Chapter 11: Have Ferret, May Travel

For health reasons, USDA regulations stipulate that airlines can’t trans-
port most animals via cargo during extreme hot or cold conditions. If
you must transport your ferret through cargo, be sure to take the
expected temperature into consideration.
 Prepare your fuzzy’s carrier for the airline regulations. Most airlines
have guidelines to make sure that your pet’s carrier is properly labeled
for identification. At minimum, you should do the following:
• Attach a label to the carrier that clearly lists your name, address,
and phone number, along with the same information for an alter-
nate contact from home.
• Attach another carrier label that states “LIVE ANIMALS,” with an
up arrow for any directionally challenged cargo handlers. Many air-
lines will supply these stickers if you ask for them.
• Include information about your final destination — such as
city/state, hotel name, and phone number — in case you need to
be contacted about your lost pet.
You also should make some food available to your ferret during flight,
and his carrier should contain comfortable bedding — fuzzy snoozy
stuff.
Some airlines require that multiple pets travel in separate carriers. Three fer-
rets may require three carriers, which means more money for traveling. In-
cabin traveling isn’t possible with three carriers, unless you have two other
family members traveling.
Always book nonstop flights whenever possible when traveling with a fuzzy —
especially if your ferret won’t be traveling in-cabin with you. A change of planes
is an added stress, and you run the risk of losing your furball in the shuffle
between flights. Nonstop flights also are shorter, thus minimizing the length of
an already wearisome situation. If your fuzzy must change planes, find out
what precautions the airline will take to ensure a safe and timely transfer.
Going international
Unless you plan to travel abroad for a very long period of time, I suggest you
leave fuzzy at home. I’ve heard of many international trips that went
smoothly, but also of several that were nightmares for everyone involved.
Traveling abroad with a ferret — whether you’re moving permanently or
vacationing — can go quite smoothly, though, if you follow the guidelines of
the airline (see the preceding section) and destination country. With regard
to the latter, be sure to research the following:
186
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

 Does the destination country have a quarantine requirement?
 Does your fuzzy’s health certificate need to be translated into the appro-
priate language?
 Does the destination country require that you obtain an import license?
 Do you need to mail or fax the proper paperwork prior to you leaving
the country? (Always keep copies on you.)
 What’s required to get through customs with your pet? (Usually, the
proper documents get you right through.)
Most international flights have layovers before passengers continue on to
their planned destinations. Almost all airlines allow passengers to visit their
pets during layovers — if they’ve made prior arrangements. During this time,
check on how your fuzzy is doing, and give him water, food, or any necessary
medication.
Leaving Your Furball in Good Hands
You’ve decided to leave your fuzzy at home, in the care of capable handlers?
Aaaaah, now this is a vacation! As much as I love fuzzies, I just have to get
away from time to time, with no one to take care of but myself. Don’t get me
wrong, I always buckle with anxiety over finding the right person to watch my
babies or the right place to take them to. And, of course, while I’m supposed
to be relaxing on vacation, I’m wondering how all my kids are managing with-
out me. Usually, when I get home, I must face the reality that some other
people can play Fuzzy Mom just as well as I do. It’s quite an ego smasher.
The following sections outline your two best options for ferret care in your
stead: sitters and boarding centers. Here you find out how to make sure that
you leave your fuzzy in good hands so you can relax (or get your business
done, as the case may be).
No matter who takes care of your ferret while you’re gone, make sure that you
educate him or her on ferret basics — especially those considerations unique
to your fuzzy. For example, you should provide the following information:
 The phone number where you can be reached and the name of the
people you’ll be staying with
 An emergency phone number (or two) of someone close to home, such
as a friend or relative
 Your veterinarian’s phone number and address, as well as the emer-
gency clinic’s phone number and address
187
Chapter 11: Have Ferret, May Travel

 A copy of your fuzzy’s medical records in case he needs to go some-
where for an emergency
 A copy of your ferret’s rabies vaccination certificate or tag
 An adequate supply of necessary medication, as well as exact instruc-
tions on how to medicate your ferret
Be sure to demonstrate the procedure (especially dosing) before you
leave.
 A written description of your ferret and his personality (attach photos
next to each description if you have multiple ferrets to be extra helpful),
including any necessary do’s and don’ts
 An adequate supply of food, along with precise written and demon-
strated instructions on feeding (especially if you use a varied diet or you
have a ferret that requires assisted feedings)
 Detailed instructions on how to clean up after your ferret, supervise safe
playtime, and watch for signs of illness or injury
 A copy of Ferrets For Dummies, 2nd Edition!
When you leave your ferret in the hands of others, risk is involved. Nothing is
foolproof. All you can really do is prepare your ferret’s temporary caretaker
as best you can. The more you educate, the better off everyone will be. More
often than not, you’ll arrive home to a happy, healthy ferret that’s just darn
glad to see you.
Let the interviews begin: Finding 
the perfect pet sitter
Many people scoff at the idea of paying strangers to come to their homes to
visit with and care for their ferrets while they’re away. But more and more
people are choosing this option as reliable pet sitters gain experience and
good reputations. Often, pet sitters come highly recommended by previous
clients, veterinarians, friends, or neighbors. And pet sitters aren’t just for
vacationers anymore. Many people who work long hours choose pet sitters
to assist in the routine care of their fuzzies.
If at all possible, pick a pet sitter who comes highly recommended by some-
one you trust. Request and carefully check the sitter’s references. This
person will have a key to your house and access to your belongings, not to
mention the responsibility of the complete care of your fuzzy.
Trustworthiness, reliability, and honesty are all musts.
188
Part III: Basic Ferret Care and Feeding 

Here are a few of the many questions you may consider asking a potential pet
sitter:
 How long have you been pet sitting?
 Do you belong to an association?
 Do you charge per day? Per ferret? Per visit?
 Have you ever worked with ferrets? How long? How many clients?
 What do you know about ferrets? Do you like them?
 Who’s your current veterinarian?
 What’s your procedure in case of an emergency?
 Do you have a backup sitter in case of an emergency?
 How often do you come to the house?
 What do you do if the client runs out of food/supplies?
 Do you medicate ferrets? Are you knowledgeable/experienced in 
medicating?
Depending on how much you’re willing to spend, your pet sitter can make a
daily visit or stop by several times throughout the day. The sitter may clean
daily, every other day, or however often you request. The arrangements usu-
ally are based on a fee schedule. Discuss your options with the pet sitter
before you leave, and get everything in writing.
You may choose a trusted neighbor or friend to be your pet sitter. With all
the animals at my home/shelter, it takes several people to come in on a daily
basis to help with upkeep when I go away. I feel like I’m leaving a 100-page
manual behind, but I always feel better if I know the people who will be
coming into my home. Keep in mind: A paid pet sitter usually does a good job
because his or her reputation relies on it; a friend usually does a good job
because a friendship depends on it. On the other hand, having friends watch
your pets can be tricky and awkward if you’re not happy with the job they
did. Each situation is different. Go with the option that makes you feel most
comfortable and works best for your ferret.
Many pet sitters are more familiar with dogs, cats, and birds. It’s up to you in
some cases to educate the pet sitter on how to properly care for fuzzies. A
good pet sitter should be willing to stop over once or twice before you leave
to get acquainted with your fuzzbutt and his routine.
189
Chapter 11: Have Ferret, May Travel

Away to camp: Boarding your ferret
If you can’t find a reliable person to care for your fuzzy in your own home,
you should board him while you’re away. You have several boarding options:
 Some veterinarians board pets for a fee.
 Some ferret shelters will watch your ferret temporarily for a fee if you
promise to pick him up within a designated period of time.
 A friend may agree to board a fuzzy houseguest temporarily.
 Some professional boarding facilities house animals other than dogs 
and cats.
If you choose an unfamiliar person or place to watch your fuzzy, get refer-
ences and check them out. Visit the home, shelter, clinic, or boarding facility
to evaluate its overall condition. Don’t leave your ferret there unless you’re
completely comfortable and have checked the cages for safety and security.
Make sure you provide emergency numbers, explicit instructions, and so on
before you leave. Also, you may face a few more hurdles if you board your
ferret while you’re gone:
 You may have to transport the ferret’s condo to the home or facility.
 You’ll have to provide your ferret’s food because his diet is likely to be
unique.
 You may be required to provide proof of current vaccinations or a health
certificate.
If the person or boarding facility doesn’t require proof of current vacci-
nations or a health certificate, I’d avoid that person or facility altogether.
If the person or place doesn’t ask you for proof of your pet’s health, it
probably doesn’t ask other boarders for proof, either.
 You may have to take the time to educate the caretaker on ferret-
proofing and care so that he or she can go the extra mile while you’re
away. Many facilities aren’t properly prepared to allow your ferret his
daily freedom and exercise. Same goes for the homes of friends —
unless you take the time to educate them.
If you send your ferret to a boarding facility, shelter, or animal clinic, you run
the risk of your fuzzy catching a disease or an illness from another animal. 
A friend’s home isn’t always safe, either — especially if the home contains
other ferrets or animals. Make sure that your ferret is up to date on his shots
(see Chapter 12).

Tackling Your
Ferret’s Health
Issues and
Treatments

In this part . . .
A
s a ferret owner, you need to prepare for minor (and
major) catastrophes by having the best vet picked
out and your first-aid kit stocked because every pet owner
will face an emergency at one time or another. This part
has you covered. In addition, I cover the most common
diseases and illnesses ferrets face and explain what to
look for and when you need to seek expert advice. This
part also takes an in-depth look at knowing when to say
goodbye to your ferret and covers the things to expect
after she’s gone. You have so much more to think about
than you may realize.
Note: This part isn’t meant to take the place of a veteri-
narian! Some of the chapters here merely guide you
through administering basic first aid until your ferret 
can see the vet.

Chapter 12
Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health
Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits
In This Chapter
 Choosing a good ferret vet
 Taking your fuzzy for routine checkups and preventative vaccines
 Filling your fuzzy first-aid kit with the essentials
 Preparing for emergencies
H
ealth issues are inevitable for most creatures, and ferrets are no differ-
ent. That’s why you won’t find many unemployed veterinarians! You
can go through loads of trouble to safeguard your ferret, but something’s
bound to happen anyway. Some mishaps are preventable; others are not.
Often, what has you running for the first-aid kit is an illness or an age-related
problem. Here’s the bottom line: If the situation is something you can learn
from, soak up the lesson so you can prevent the episode from happening
again.
All ferret owners need to arm themselves with certain information and tools
for those “just-in-case” situations. That’s what this chapter is all about. I dis-
cuss the process you should go through to select a qualified veterinarian for
your fuzzy. Finding a good ferret vet at the very last, desperate moment can
be difficult — if not life threatening — so start right away. Even if you aren’t
facing an emergency, your ferret still needs routine checkups and vaccina-
tions to ensure good health, so I cover these topics as well. I list the items
that need to go into your very own fuzzy first-aid kit. Trust me, it’s better to
have an unopened bottle of Betadine solution sit for ages than to get caught
in a situation where you desperately need it but don’t have it. Finally, I show
you how to prepare for emergency situations so you can care for your ferret
in her most pressing time of need.

I get phone calls all the time from people asking me for advice about their
sick ferrets. Remember: I’m not a vet, nor do I claim to be. You shouldn’t use
this book in lieu of a visit to your vet. I purposely leave out dosage recom-
mendations in this book because every ferret is different and every situation
is different. You shouldn’t diagnose your ferret, or give her prescription or
over-the-counter meds, without a veterinarian consult. Also, providing first
aid for your ferret doesn’t mean you can forego a trip to the vet if the situa-
tion warrants it. Use your best judgment, and keep your ferret’s health and
happiness in mind at all times.
Selecting Your Ferret’s Veterinarian
At some point, all responsible pet owners venture into a veterinarian’s office.
A vet handles your pet’s routine care, answers questions about concerns you
have, handles neuters/spays, and addresses any unforeseen emergencies.
Your vet will become a part of your life, so knowing what to look for is impor-
tant when searching for your ferret’s doctor.
In your search for a vet, you’ll encounter fancy, expensive veterinary facili-
ties, modest, single-doctor practices, and many that fall in between. Don’t
judge a vet’s abilities on looks alone. Rely on a vet’s reputation, recommenda-
tions you receive, and your gut feelings.
In the following sections, I cover some questions you should ask potential
vets and the importance of swinging by for a visit before entrusting your pet
to a particular vet or clinic. And because your vet can and should be your
ally in your ferret’s care, I outline the ways you can develop a good working
relationship with the doctor you choose.
Word of mouth is a wonderful way to find a good ferret vet. Talk to other
ferret owners you know or who you can locate through your breeder or other
acquaintances. Ask where they take their babies and what kind of care they
receive. Call your local ferret shelter to see who people there recommend.
With so many ferret-crazed people out there today, you’re bound to find a
good veterinarian! (Chapter 10 covers more ways to network with ferret
owners.)
Interviewing potential vets
In your search for a vet, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Questions are your
best tools. A good, professional veterinarian and staff will recognize your
valid concerns and won’t hesitate to answer your questions as completely as
possible.
194
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Begin by calling a clinic and asking whoever answers the phone if the doctor
treats ferrets. Some don’t and will refer you elsewhere. When you find a can-
didate that does treat fuzzies, do a little more investigation by asking the
person on the phone if he has time to answer some questions. Better yet,
leave a message for the vet to call you back. Make a list of the following ques-
tions and, of course, revise them depending on who you’re talking to:
 How long have you been practicing ferret medicine? How many ferrets
do you encounter in a typical day or week?
 Does your facility stock vaccinations for ferrets, such as the USDA-
approved rabies vaccine?
 Is your facility capable of properly housing ferrets that may need to be
hospitalized? Can you handle overnight stays? Emergencies?
 What are your fees for routine care, such as checkups and vaccinations?
 Do you perform routine surgeries (such as spaying and neutering) on
ferrets? Do you have experience with the more difficult surgeries, such
as splenectomies, adrenal surgery, or other tumor removals?
 Can you handle and treat common diseases of the ferret?
 How do you stay up to date on the latest developments in ferret medi-
cine and surgical techniques? What continuing education do you 
participate in?
Don’t forget to be kind and courteous during the questioning, and always
remember to thank the vet when you’re through! The answers the vet and his
staff give, and the general tone with which they give them, should give you a
sense of whether this office is ferret-friendly. Do you feel comfortable with
this doctor? If you don’t, chances are your ferret won’t either.
Going for a visit
After you talk to a vet who seems qualified and meets your criteria, pay the
doctor a visit. You want to see if this doctor is all he appeared to be on the
phone or as described by other clients. First appearances usually are a good
indication of how the vet runs his practice:
 Are the office and treatment areas clean? Do they smell clean?
 Were you greeted in a friendly manner by the staff?
 Are the exam tables sanitized after each use?
 Do technicians and vets wash their hands after handling animals?
195
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

If you already have your fuzzy, you can assume that she’s probably due for 
a checkup. Now’s a great time to see the potential vet in action with your 
furball:
 Does the vet talk to your ferret in a calming way?
 Does he handle your ferret with care and show genuine concern for both
you and your pet?
It’s very important that your new veterinarian listen to and acknowledge
your concerns. You’re the ferret’s caregiver. If you’ve had her for some
time, you know what’s normal for your ferret. A vet who doesn’t listen to
you and learn from you may be too presumptuous to give your ferret the
care that she needs — especially in emergency situations.
 Does he explain what’s being done in a concise and clear manner?
 Does he answer your questions in an understandable fashion?
 Does he seem rushed and preoccupied with other goings-on in the clinic,
or is he focused on your pet?
Have you found a knowledgeable and caring vet who works in a clean, effi-
cient, and friendly office? Congrats! If not, keep searching until you find a vet
who meets all your requirements.
A good vet will have a network of other professionals he can rely on for sup-
port with difficult or unfamiliar cases. The willingness to reach out for help
and to learn from others is a positive trait and one that should be looked for
in a vet as well.
Developing a good working relationship
It’s important that you maintain a comfortable and efficient working relation-
ship with your vet built on trust and respect. Your veterinarian, like you,
should have your pet’s well-being at the top of his priority list. No one knows
your pet like you do, and your vet will count on you to tell him when your
ferret isn’t quite herself. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve brought in an
animal that looked fine but that had a “look” about her that told me she
wasn’t quite right. In those cases, routine tests always revealed ailments.
Your second sense is what can link you and your veterinarian in your quest
to keep fuzzy healthy.
Here are some things you can do to develop a working relationship with your
vet and make your interactions friendlier and more efficient:
196
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Keep accurate records. Take the guesswork out of communicating with
your vet. Write down how your ferret is acting when you think she’s sick.
Record what supportive care you’ve provided and how she’s responded.
List any medications and dosages you’ve administered and record any
improvements or setbacks that you observe. And with all these observa-
tions, make sure you include times in hours and minutes.
 Know your animal. If you can’t bring your pet in to the office yourself,
make sure you give the person who can your fuzzy’s basic information.
Vets get frustrated when people can’t answer basic questions about the
animals they bring in. Create a basic information card for your ferret
that explains how you feed and house her, how you handle her, how she
normally acts, what her issues are, and so on. Best-case scenario: Bring
in your fuzzy yourself.
 Do what the vet tells you to do. Give medications on time and at the
correct dosages, and give them for as long as you’re supposed to. Just as
important, follow through with phone calls to the vet to give him
progress reports.
 Ask questions. Your vet’s job is to not only treat your ferret, but also to
answer your questions. Write down any questions you have before you
get there and be ready to take notes when the vet is talking to you.
Never feel foolish for asking questions!
 Stay educated, but don’t be demanding. You can do research on cur-
rent health issues and be willing to learn what you can about your
ferret’s health. It’s great to learn these things, but don’t force what you
learn on your vet, for multiple reasons:
• Your vet may already know the information.
• It shows a lack of trust and respect for your vet.
• Your vet will find it hard to work with a demanding know-it-all.
Instead, work as a team and offer up what you’ve learned. Seek your
vet’s professional opinion by asking how what you’ve learned can fit into
your pet’s diagnosis or treatment plan.
 Be honest. Relationships are built on honesty and trust. Here are some
specific situations when truth will keep your relationship with your vet
strong:
• A vet doesn’t want to hear “She was fine this morning” while look-
ing at an animal that’s obviously been in distress for days. Your vet
depends on you to tell him everything that’s going on. Your hon-
esty may mean the difference between an accurate diagnosis and a
misdiagnosis.
197
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

• Be upfront from the start about your financial situation. Don’t
make your vet guess what you can and can’t afford to do for your
pet. The cost of care is a sensitive area for both sides, so just be
honest.
• Tell the truth about how you’ve followed through on treatment
plans. If you didn’t do what the vet told you to do, tell him so he
doesn’t assume that his plan doesn’t work.
 Respect boundaries. Never have another vet call yours to provide help
without your vet’s prior knowledge and permission. It not only catches
your vet off guard, but also shows a lack of trust in and respect for him.
 Report problems you have at the vet’s office. If you should have a
problem at a veterinary practice for any reason, report it to the proper
staff member immediately. Voice your concerns respectfully and calmly,
and be prepared to reach some sort of solution. Leaving the office angry
or upset doesn’t satisfy anyone or leave room for improvement. Vets
want to clear up problems in their offices and prevent them from 
happening in the future.
 Leave your personal issues at home. The vet’s exam room or waiting
room is no place to start arguing over whether your pet’s treatment is
worth X amount of dollars. Nor is it the place to announce to your
spouse that you want a divorce. Come alone or agree ahead of time to
table any heated topics you want to discuss.
The bottom line: Keeping the lines of communication open will help your vet
give your ferret the best care he possibly can.
Putting Your Vet to Work with
Vaccinations and Checkups
I’m one of those people who thinks that no matter where or when you get a
new pet, you should make a visit to the vet within a day or two of her home-
coming and continue with regular checkups from that point on. If you take your
fuzzy in for a checkup every year (every six months for ferrets 3 years and
older), your vet will be able to rule out any illnesses and vaccinate your ferret if
she’s due. I’m an advocate of regular vaccinations for pets. Vaccinations for 
ferrets keep your fuzzy safe from disease. Without them, ferrets are highly 
susceptible to canine distemper. They may also contract the rabies virus.
This section covers ferret checkups and vaccinations. You find out what your
vet does for your kit (baby ferret) or for your grown-up fuzzy, and I let you
know how to watch for warning signals that your fuzzy is having an allergic
reaction to a vaccine or other medicine.
198
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

I can’t advise you one way or another when it comes to vaccinating your pet.
The only person who can help you make vaccination decisions is your veteri-
narian. He should know how your fuzzy tolerated vaccinations in the past
and how she’ll likely tolerate them in the future. Discuss the pros and cons of
vaccinating your ferret with your vet. Together, based on your fuzzy’s history
and future concerns, you can come up with a workable plan to keep your
ferret safe.
Kits — the office visit
Baby ferrets (kits) receive some protective antibodies from their mothers,
but these eventually start to wear away in stages as the kits age. Therefore,
you must vaccinate your kit to counteract this gradual loss of protection.
When you get your fuzzy, schedule an appointment to get her shots. Most
farm-raised babies receive their first ferret-approved, modified live canine
distemper shots at 4 to 6 weeks old. Private breeders usually give the first
shots at 6 to 8 weeks.
Confer with your vet and avoid using a distemper vaccine that has anything
other than canine distemper vaccine in it — canine hepatitis, leptospirosis,
parainfluenza, and so on, for instance. Ferrets shouldn’t get vaccinated for
these diseases. The USDA ferret-approved vaccine is strictly canine distemper.
Distemper vaccine
Depending on your veterinarian, your ferret kit may be vaccinated for canine
distemper — depending on its age at the time of the visit — according to dif-
ferent vaccine protocols (see Chapter 15 for more on canine distemper):
 One vet may want to vaccinate for canine distemper at 8, 11, and 
14 weeks of age.
 Other vets prefer to vaccinate at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age.
 Ferrets over 16 weeks of age with unknown or no vaccination history
only need two distemper shots, given three to four weeks apart. At this
age, the ferrets receive the same protection as the kits that receive the
full series of distemper vaccinations.
Although uncommon, some ferrets have allergic reactions to the distemper
booster (see the later section “Recognizing allergic reactions” for the signs).
The allergic reaction may happen only once, or it may happen repeatedly.
Some reactions can be life-threatening. If your ferret has a history of allergic
reactions, your vet may pretreat her with an antihistamine to offset any reac-
tion. If your ferret has a history of severe, life-threatening allergic reactions to
the distemper vaccine, and she’s strictly an indoor pet with no contact with
strange ferrets, you may want to consider skipping the distemper vaccine.
199
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

Rabies vaccine
The USDA ferret-approved rabies vaccine is a killed vaccine and is labeled for
use after the age of 12 weeks. Some vets wait until the ferret is 14 to 18 weeks
old, just in case the fuzzy’s birthday got recorded incorrectly somewhere
along the way. The rabies vaccine will prevent your ferret from contracting
rabies if she becomes exposed. Additionally, the proof of rabies vaccination
likely will keep her out of boiling water should she bite or scratch someone
(see Chapter 3). Without this proof, she may be quarantined or possibly lose
her life. For this reason, you can’t skip the rabies booster for any reason.
The timing of the rabies shot can be an issue for you, your vet, and your
ferret. Many experts believe that a ferret should receive the rabies and 
distemper shots at least two weeks apart to prevent any potential allergic
reactions. Keep that suggestion in mind when scheduling your ferret’s 
vaccinations.
Overall kit checkup
In addition to the vaccines, your vet should set up an appointment to per-
form an overall checkup. The checkup should include testing your kit for
internal parasites. To complete the tests, the vet requires a poop sample on
your first visit. This sample also gives your vet an idea of how your ferret’s
digestive tract is performing.
An overall checkup should, at the very least, include these other elements as
well:
 Weighing your fuzzy
 Listening to her heart and lungs
 Feeling her abdomen
 Checking her skin for external parasites and any abnormalities
 Checking her eyes, ears, and teeth
Adolescents and adults — the office visit
If you adopt an adult fuzzy, you don’t need to make four or five trips to the
vet like you would with a kit, but you do need to make at least two. Your
ferret should receive a canine distemper shot along with her initial physical
exam (see the previous section for explanations of these processes).
200
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

You should bring your ferret back about three weeks later for a second dis-
temper shot as well as a rabies shot (assuming she’s older than 3 months).
Often, a vet will have you come in a third time for the rabies shot instead of
giving it along with the final distemper shot to minimize the chance of a bad
reaction. You can discuss this important option with your vet and come to a
decision.
If you adopt an adult ferret with a questionable background, vaccinate her
just in case. Better safe than sorry!
Checkups for adult ferrets are a little more complicated. In addition to per-
forming annual exams like a ferret kit would receive, your vet should do some
extra palpating (touchy-feely stuff) to rule out enlarged organs (particularly
the spleen) or suspicious lumps. Middle-aged ferrets, or those 3 years and
older, are at an increased risk for disease and should have routine exams
every six months. Disease can spread rapidly, so early detection and inter-
vention are imperative. It’s also recommended that your vet test blood glu-
cose every six months, so speak to him about this. Other blood testing and
X-rays for heart disease and so on can be done on a yearly basis.
Don’t forget to bring a morsel of poop to your fuzzy’s physical exam; you’ll
make your vet’s day, and he’ll be able to rule out parasites.
During your initial appointments with the vet, broach the topic of the
dreaded heartworm disease. If you’re a responsible dog owner, you should
already know about it. Just like dogs and cats, ferrets are susceptible to
heartworm, a mosquito-delivered disease. Even if you don’t take your ferret
outside, she isn’t bulletproof, because mosquitoes can get into your house.
For more information on heartworm — including recognizing its symptoms
and treating it — head to Chapter 15.
Recognizing allergic reactions
Ferrets can have a reaction to the vaccinations given by veterinarians. This
allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, almost always occurs within 30 minutes
of the vaccination injection, but it can occur up to 24 hours later. Anaphylaxis
isn’t very common; it can present itself as either a slight reaction or, at worst,
a life-threatening condition.
The first 24 hours after the vaccination is the most crucial period; after that,
your fuzzy should be in the clear. You need to remain vigilant during the 
initial period as you watch for signs of a bad reaction. Here are the signs of
anaphylaxis:
201
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

 Swelling around the eyes or nose
A tiny lump where the needle went in isn’t a reaction; a tiny lump is very
common.
 Vomiting
 Diarrhea (may be bloody)
 Seizures
 Lethargy
Usually, another sign should accompany the lethargy because a trip to
the vet can be exhausting for your fuzzy.
 Pale mucous membranes (the tissue around the eyes or the gums)
A ferret that exhibits signs of anaphylaxis may not have a reaction to every
single shot. Likewise, just because your ferret hasn’t shown signs of anaphy-
laxis before doesn’t mean that she never will.
I recommend that you wait around the clinic during the immediate waiting
period (the first 30 minutes after the vaccine) just to be safe. It’s important to
immediately treat a fuzzy that’s suffering from anaphylaxis. If you’re already
home when you notice the signs, pack right up and head back to the vet. On
the way, keep your ferret warm (she may be experiencing the beginning signs
of shock).
To treat anaphylaxis, your vet will most likely give your fuzzy an injection
(yes, another one!) of an antihistamine and/or cortisone. Some vets also
administer fluids. (Note: Some vets like to pretreat a ferret with a history of
vaccination allergy with this medicine just to be on the safe side.) This
course of action treats the allergic reaction and heads off the shock, which
can be deadlier to your ferret than the allergic reaction itself.
Stocking Your Ferret First-Aid Kit
Perhaps you’ve already equipped your household with a first-aid kit for
human use. A lot of what you put in your own first-aid kit also is useful for
treating ferrets, but I recommend that you put together a first-aid kit strictly
for your little fuzzy.
Always consult your vet before including (and using) any over-the-counter
products, medications, or supplements in your fuzzy first-aid kit. Using some
common items to treat your ferret may actually aggravate certain illnesses or
diseases. Also, you need to get the proper dosage amounts from your vet for
treatments. It’s easy to overdose a ferret on medication.
202
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Every ferret first-aid kit should include the following items (Note: If you use
something from the kit, be sure to replace it as soon as possible):
 Emergency phone numbers:
• Your veterinarian’s number
• The number to a 24-hour emergency clinic
• The number for the National Animal Poison Control Center
To reach the National Animal Poison Control Center, you can call
888-426-4435. This service costs $55 per case — credit cards only.
 Health records (include the following for each of your ferrets):
• General health records with a corresponding identification photo
of the ferret
• Rabies certificates
• A list of prescription medications your ferret is currently taking
 Foodstuffs:
• Jars of meat baby food — chicken or lamb (for the sick kid)
• Light Karo syrup or Nutri-Cal (for a quick calorie boost)
• Pedialyte or Gatorade (to rehydrate a dehydrated ferret)
• A can of prescription feline A/D, which you can get from your vet
(easily digested food for the sicky)
• Oxbow Carnivore Care (an excellent, complete supplement)
• Canola or olive oil (may help to move bad stuff through)
• Royal Canin canned diet (for sick ferrets needing good nutrition)
• Feline hairball laxative or preventive
All ferret owners should know about Carnivore Care, which is available
from Oxbow Pet Products. This highly palatable nutritional supplement
is made with easily digestible protein that’s suitable for carnivores such
as ferrets. The supplement offers complete nutrition to ferrets with
reduced appetites. For more information on this product, head to the
Web site www.oxbowhay.com; you can call 800-249-0366 to order it (you
can’t order online). You must provide your veterinarian’s information
when ordering this product (see Chapter 8 for more on diet).
I’ve listed many different meat sources for your first-aid kit, but you
don’t have to stock them all. You can stock one or stock all. It’s a per-
sonal preference. You may want to start off by including them all in case
you get a sick ferret that turns out to be a picky eater. But if you decide
to stick with one, Carnivore Care is my first choice.
203
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

 Cleaning solutions:
• Betadine solution (for cleaning cuts)
• Nolvasan (for cleaning cuts)
You can sometimes find this as an ear cleaner.
• Ear cleanser (for routine grooming)
• Eye wash/rinse (for flushing foreign bodies)
• Sterile saline solution (for flushing wounds)
 Bandages and wraps:
• Gauze pads
• Gauze wrap
• Washcloths
• Vet wrap (self-sticking variety — you can find this in drug stores in
the bandage section)
• Adhesive bandage tape (cloth tape works the best)
 Other health aids:
• Styptic powder or beeswax (for bleeding nails)
• Antibiotic ointment (for soothing and protecting cuts and scrapes;
Neosporin works well)
• Petroleum jelly (to help move a blockage and for lubricating a 
thermometer)
• Kaopectate or Pepto-Bismol (for diarrhea and soothing the tummy)
• Ferretone/Linatone (for mixing with medicine that tastes like you-
know-what)
• Pediatric Liquid Benadryl (for counteracting allergic reactions; see
the section “Recognizing allergic reactions”)
Tylenol (acetaminophen) is extremely toxic to ferrets even in very low
doses. The liver metabolizes the medicine, and it will send your ferret
into liver failure quickly, eventually killing your fuzzy. Many over-the-
counter medicines contain acetaminophen. Therefore, don’t use any
over-the-counter products without your vet’s guidance and approval.
You can prevent these types of fatal mistakes.
Bene-Bac is one of the most widely recommended items when it comes
to ferret first-aid kits, because it’s designed to replace beneficial bacteria
in the digestive tract after illness or diarrhea. What you may not know,
however, is that it doesn’t work for obligate carnivores, such as ferrets.
The bacteria contained in Bene-Bac is made for omnivores and some
herbivores. Using Bene-Bac won’t hurt your ferret, but it won’t help,
either; it only helps you feel better!
204
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Miscellaneous items:
• Heating pad (to help maintain a young or sick ferret’s body 
temperature)
• Chemical heating pack (portable heat for the young or sick ferret)
• Nail clippers
• Eye droppers
• Tweezers (to remove foreign bodies)
• Cotton balls and cotton swabs
• Ice pack (to reduce swelling or slow down bleeding)
• Rubber or latex gloves
• Scissors
• Pen light (to help you see wounds and foreign bodies)
• Pill crusher
• Rectal thermometer
The normal temperature for a ferret is about 102° Fahrenheit.
• Tongue depressors or popsicle sticks (for immobilizing injured
limbs)
• Baby wipes (for general cleanup duties)
I also suggest that, whenever possible, you bring your first-aid kit to your
ferret, as opposed to bringing your injured ferret to the first-aid kit. Make this
easier by storing your first-aid supplies in a convenient and portable case.
Fishing-tackle boxes and professional make-up boxes work great. You can
also do a lot with Tupperware! Get one large bin and keep your supplies orga-
nized and labeled in smaller containers within that bin. Keep your first-aid
case in a convenient and easy-to-reach location.
Ensuring Emergency Preparedness
Whether you’ve lived through them or have only heard about them, you
know that real pet emergencies take place all the time. It seems like you hear
more and more about disasters striking, leaving families and their pets with
few options and nowhere to go. Disasters come in all shapes and sizes:
floods, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, and more.
205
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

Have you prepared your family and fuzzies to escape an emergency? Are you
prepared to care for your pets during an emergency? Preparing for the collec-
tion and evacuation of your ferrets takes time, thought, and practice. Using
the information in the following sections, you can take action and come up
with a plan that best suits your situation.
The basic (quick) evacuation kit
The basic evacuation kit is for an emergency that allows for a small window
of time to evacuate. Your only pet-related goal during a serious emergency is
to get your ferret out quickly and safely. That’s it. Anything else is just icing
on the cake — and potentially dangerous icing at that.
The basic evacuation kit I suggest you put together is based on that one goal,
making it quite simple. Here’s what you need in this kit:
 A flashlight (in case the lights go out)
 A fabric bag (a thick pillowcase or something stronger to actually hold
your ferrets in)
 A strong piece of rope (to tie the bag of ferrets shut; it should be about 
2 feet)
 A small fire extinguisher (to put out any small fires you encounter)
 A police whistle, which you can purchase at an Army surplus store, or
something equally loud and piercing (to call your ferrets)
The kit may seem too simple, but the purpose is to remain safe and get out
fast. With this in mind, make sure you store the kit in a handy container and
locate it in a convenient place.
Most ferret owners have more than one ferret. Actually, many have an abun-
dance of ferrets! For every four ferrets you have, you need to pack one fabric
bag and one piece of rope. In a true get-out-fast-or-else emergency, one bag
may do fine for up to six or seven ferrets, but the strength of the bag may
decrease with each ferret you put inside.
Collecting and evacuating your fuzzy
The number-one rule in an emergency is to stay calm, because you know
your ferret won’t. When an emergency strikes, pick up your ferret and toss
her in a sack. When you’re done with the sack, tie it off securely with the
rope. When your ferret is safe and secure, leave the house. You’ve done 
your job.
206
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

If you have more than one fuzzy, an emergency situation is no time to worry
about who gets along with whom. Pick up your ferrets and toss them in the
sack. After you tie it off securely with the rope, get the heck out of there.
I’m in no way advocating that you should put your own life at risk to save the
life of your pet. Trained professionals will come to the scene of an emergency
to help you and your pet in times of crisis. Losing a pet is heartbreaking, but
losing your life while trying to save a pet is catastrophic for many.
The deluxe (and orderly) evacuation kit
The basic evacuation kit is for a serious emergency that calls for quick
action. The deluxe evacuation kit, on the other hand, is for an emergency that
you know is coming, but that you have time to plan for. For example, a forest
fire that’s slowly making its way toward your home. Or a hurricane that’s pre-
dicted to hit land in the next 24 hours. These are tragedies that you can pre-
pare for with a little window of time. The deluxe kit is designed to be picked
up and put in a car, taking up as little space as possible. Like the ferret first-
aid kit and the basic evacuation kit (see earlier sections in this chapter), you
should keep the deluxe kit in an area that’s easily accessible and in a case
that’s ready to go.
In addition to the materials I mention for the basic kit, the deluxe kit should
contain the following items; it may seem like a lot, but after you gather it up,
you’ll be done, and hopefully you’ll never have to use the kit:
 Foodstuffs:
• Jars of chicken baby food
• At least a week’s supply of your ferret’s food, kept in a re-sealable
container (swap out for fresh food regularly, if possible)
• Bottled water
• Pedialyte
 A basic first-aid kit:
• Betadine/iodine solution
• Gauze pads/wrap
• Adhesive tape
• Antibiotic cream/ointment
• Ferretone
• Heating pad or chemical heat packs
207
Chapter 12: Setting Up Your Ferret’s Health Plan: Vets and First-Aid Kits

• Tweezers
• Cotton swabs
• Scissors
• Latex gloves
• Popsicle sticks
• Baby wipes
• Sanitizing gel
• Eye dropper
• A week’s supply of medication (if necessary)
 Restraint and identification:
• Leash and harness with ID tag for each ferret
• Carrier or cage large enough for your ferret to move around in
• Copy of medical and up-to-date vaccination records
• Adoption/registration papers or other proof of ownership 
(including microchip number)
• Ferret identification card, which includes a recent photo, a written
physical description (including tattoos and medical conditions),
and a behavioral description
• An ID card with your name, address, phone number(s), and 
veterinarian’s phone number
• Pre-planned emergency contact lists (veterinarians, family, and
friends)
• Leather gloves (in case your ferret gets overly excited or scared
and acts out in aggression)
 Miscellaneous items:
• Bedding (hammock, snooze sack)
• Hanging water bottle
• Non-tippable bowls
• Spoons
• Small garbage bags
• Dish soap
• Disposable litter tray
• Paper towels

Helping Your Hurt Ferret: 
First-Aid Basics
In This Chapter
 Previewing a ferret’s minor afflictions
 Acting in the event of an emergency
 Caring for your fuzzy in-house
 Arranging a room for your sick ferret
 Getting your sick ferret to eat
You must face the facts: Your little ferret friend is (or will be) a trouble
magnet. No matter how much you love him or how much money you
spend on preventive care, your ferret will eventually test your first-aid knowl-
edge and your ability to work under severe emotional duress. Even if you
keep your ferret confined to a cage all day and night (Caution: The ferret
patrol and I will hunt you down and pummel you if you do!), you’ll still have a
misfortune here or there. And even the sweetest, most innocent ferret may
have a mishap through no fault of his own.
This chapter covers the process of providing immediate first aid. I discuss
how to identify and fix an easy problem and how to control a difficult one
until your fuzzy can receive care from a medical professional. I explain how
you can manage your fuzzy’s pain during injury or illness situations. And I go
through the steps you can take during your ferret’s recovery to keep him
comfortable and nourished. (The other chapters in Part IV explain the seri-
ous diseases and illnesses you may come across and how you can treat
them.)

Behaviors You Usually Don’t 
Need to Worry About
You’ll be happy to read that some funky ferret behaviors are normal. 
Like a grown man scratching his belly and dealing with indigestion after
Thanksgiving dinner and then falling asleep during a football game, ferrets
have a few peculiar behaviors that may startle you at first. Don’t be alarmed.
Many of the behaviors I list in the following sections often are harmless, and
with the information here, you’ll be prepared to deal with them and even 
predict their onset.
Shivering
Ferrets shiver for many reasons, but most of the reasons are simple and
harmless. All ferrets shiver to raise their body temperature, which is neces-
sary after sleeping more than half the day away! Shivering is a natural and
effective temperature-raising method. Many also shiver when being scruffed.
You may want to give a little bottom support to your shivering fuzzy in a
scruffing situation (see Chapter 7). Frightened ferrets rarely shiver, but
excited ferrets often do. If you suspect that your ferret’s shivering is due to
something other than these reasons, consult your veterinarian (for info on
finding a qualified vet, refer to Chapter 12).
Itching and scratching
Ferrets are itchy critters, plain and simple. They’ll sometimes awaken from a
deep sleep just to feverishly scratch a sudden itch, and then they’ll roll over
and fall back to sleep. Or they’ll stop in the middle of a mad dash across the
room to scratch an itch. If you watch your ferret itch and scratch long
enough, you’ll begin to itch and scratch, too, because it makes most people
paranoid about fleas. But scratching often is harmless and mainly annoying
for the fuzzy.
If you do notice reddened areas, bumps, sores, or missing fur, explore your
ferret’s environment, such as his bedding and what it was last washed in.
Consider that skin tends to dry out a little during the colder months. And
although uncommon, fuzzies can have allergies. Sometimes, too much
scratching can lead to raw spots that you may need to treat topically. If this is
the case, see your vet. If you’ve ruled out fleas and no fur is missing, you can
probably chalk up the scratching to a typical ferret quirk.
210
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Yawning
Yawning is such a common ferret quirk that ferret enthusiasts have yawning
contests (see Chapter 10)! I don’t know why furkids yawn, but they do, and
they do so frequently. Maybe it has something to do with how much sleep fer-
rets indulge in. Plus, scruffed ferrets are particularly vulnerable to yawning
attacks. Although the effect of all the yawns seems nonexistent, people
watching can be enticed into their own yawning attacks. I yawn as I write this!
Excessive sleeping
Sleeping excessively is common in ferrets, so don’t take it as a sign that
you’re a complete bore. Sometimes, ferrets can sleep so hard that it appears
they’re in a coma or even dead. The fuzzies are warm and breathing, but they
just won’t wake up!
If you’re a concerned mom or dad and insist on making sure that fuzzball is
alive, you can try a few proven techniques. Start with the first and continue
through the list:
1. Lift him up and call his name loudly.
2. Give his back or belly a few good rubs, but don’t shake him violently.
3. Scratch him between the ears.
4. Scruff (see Chapter 7) and wiggle him a bit if he still hasn’t
responded.
5. Put a dab of his favorite treat on his nose (see Chapter 8). The smell
should get his little brain going; if not, he’s probably sick.
6. As a last resort, you can rub a small amount of Nutri-Cal or Karo syrup
on his gums.
Usually, this deep sleep (referred to as SND [Sleeping Not Dead]) is normal.
When the ferret finally raises an eyelid to inspect the rude gate-crasher, you
can rest assured that he’s okay. You can play with the fuzzy a bit if you still
feel the need to reassure yourself. It’s taken almost a full minute to wake up
one or two of my guys on some occasions, and it still scares the beans out of
me. If an SND situation occurs frequently with the same ferret, a trip to the vet
may be a wise idea. (Chapter 10 discusses enrichment, which may lessen the
amount of sleep your fuzzy needs, along with the proper diet [see Chapter 8].)
Although ferrets do sleep quite a bit, and some even enter the deep SND
mode, be aware of sudden changes in your furkid’s sleeping patterns. If he
starts to sleep more often than usual, he may be giving you a sign of an
underlying medical condition. Don’t ignore sudden changes in behavior,
because he may require immediate medical attention.

Sneezing, hiccuping, and coughing
With all the maladies fuzzies can get, you’d think sneezing, coughing, and hic-
cuping would be some more things to worry about. Not so. These conditions
often are harmless and even useful for the fuzzy. Fuzzballs get around by
sense of smell. If you watch closely, you’ll see that your exploring ferret has
his nose to the ground almost all the time. In the process, he’s inhaling every-
thing from dust bunnies to carpet fibers. He’s bound to snort up bits and
pieces of junk, and sneezing is the only way to clear his nose of it. When the
sneezing attack is over, it’s nose to the ground again.
Ferrets sometimes cough or hack as though they have something stuck in
their throats. It’s common and, more often than not, harmless. Coughing usu-
ally is a sign of a minor irritation to the throat or the reaction to a piece of
kibble the fuzzy swallowed too quickly. If the coughing persists, though, con-
tact your vet. Persistent coughing can also be a sign of several illnesses,
including cardiomyopathy, so take note of how much coughing your fuzzy
does and take him to see the vet. Better safe than sorry.
Hiccuping is a common and harmless fuzzy condition that results from the
spasming of the ferret’s diaphragm. In ferrets, hiccuping seems random and
more of a bother to them than a condition to worry about. In humans, hic-
cuping often is a result of too much beer! Try giving your ferret a little lick of
Ferretone or Nutri-Cal to try to shorten the duration of the hiccuping.
Butt dragging
The skid marks your ferret leaves behind after he uses the bathroom are
more than pretty decorations. They’re ferret proclamations! Ferrets like to
use butt dragging to tell other animals, including humans, where they’ve
been and what their territorial boundaries are. Although the butt dragging
may not actually leave a visual trail, you can bet your bottom dollar that he’s
left a scent behind. Not to worry; you may not notice the smell at all, but
other ferrets and animals will smell it loud and clear.
212
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 
A suckler
Some fuzzies, as with many cats and kittens,
find comfort in sucking on something soft —
especially when they’re falling asleep. (After all,
their thumbs have sharp nails at the end.) This
sucking behavior is common in animals that are
separated from their mothers at an early age.
Some ferrets view the ears of other ferrets as
pacifiers. If the recipient of the ear sucking
doesn’t mind, and his ear doesn’t become raw
and irritated, you can consider the sucking cute
and not a problem. You should, however, offer
an alternative, such as a safe baby toy.

If your fuzzy’s butt dragging seems unusually lengthy or if he does it more
and more frequently, you can have your vet check him for parasites or other
conditions that may be causing discomfort.
Because most ferrets in the United States are descented, they don’t leave
much of a scent, but they still display the behavior. These ferrets are primar-
ily trying to leave anal gland scent, not feces. Still, the scent trail is there.
After all, a butt’s a butt.
Drinking urine
No one knows for sure why some adorable little fuzzies engage in the obnox-
ious practice of urine drinking. Maybe they just want to gross us humans out.
It may be a sexual behavior. Some fuzzy experts believe that drinking urine is
just another way for a thirsty ferret to consume liquid. If you want to curtail
the activity, make sure that enough water is always available.
Honestly, although it seems disgusting to us, urine drinking is common for a
ferret. It’s a harmless act, unlike drinking too much beer, because urine is
sterile, so ferrets aren’t consuming a bunch of bacteria.
Pain Management and Care
Ferrets are quite the troopers! Their little bodies go through so much, and
they put up a tremendous fight to live during even the most difficult of times.
But ferrets, like so many other animals, are stoic creatures. They hide their
pain in order to hide their “weaknesses,” which would surely be death sen-
tences in the wild. But if you know your ferret well (and make an effort to
from the very first day you get him), you’ll be able to tell that he’s in pain,
and there’s no reason at all he needs to live that way.
213
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics
Quick FAQS on healthy ferrets
Vets talk about the following ferret basics all the
time, so get to know them to keep up with the
conversation — at least a little:
 Normal body temperature: 100–103°F (37.8–
39.4°C), with 101.9°F as the average
 Normal heart rate: 200 to 400 beats per
minute
 Normal respiration: 33 to 36 breaths per
minute

Determining if your ferret is in pain
Couple the warning signs in the following list with your intimate knowledge of
your fuzzy (or your fledgling knowledge) to tell if your ferret is in pain:
 Facial expression: Squinting, muscles twitching on the top of his head,
tooth grinding, dull eyes
 Appetite: Reduced or absent appetite, dropping food from the mouth,
difficulty swallowing, standing over food dish but not eating, selecting
only soft foods
 Posture: Tucked abdomen, lying on side with no ability to get up, inabil-
ity to stretch out or curl up
 Activity: Gait abnormalities (limping, holding limbs up, or dragging),
restricted movement, trembling
 Grooming: Failure to groom himself, poor coat appearance, excessive
licking or scratching
 Self-awareness: Protecting a body area, licking or chewing a body area
 Vocalization: Crying or moaning periodically, vocalizing when defecat-
ing, urinating, or moving
 Attitude: Unusual aggression, hiding more than usual, seeking comfort,
bristling tail with depressed behavior, dull or uninterested attitude
toward surroundings
 Response to being touched: Protective, vocalizing, escaping, biting
Some of the signs and behaviors in the previous list, while generally associ-
ated with pain, aren’t solely indicators of pain. Some can be signs of other
conditions. It all depends on your fuzzy. Pain can elicit extreme behaviors at
opposite ends of the spectrum. Your ferret’s pain may cause him to act
unusually needy and seek comfort from you. Another ferret in pain may hide
and isolate himself more than usual. No matter what, if any of the listed signs
are present, you can assume that something abnormal is going on. A call and
visit to your vet are warranted.
Caring for a ferret in pain
You have many options to manage your ferret’s pain, and fortunately the list
is growing. Managing pain will keep your ferret comfortable and help him
recover from surgery, illness, or injury. Pain management during and after
surgery or for an injury or chronic illness should always be a part of routine
supportive care. Speak to your vet about it to set up a pain management 
regimen.
214
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

You’ll know the pain management regimen you and your vet have chosen is
working when the signs of pain begin to alleviate and your ferret starts to act
more like himself. If, however, the signs continue or worsen, you need to con-
tact your vet immediately to discuss a change of plans.
The following list presents some of the most common pain medications cur-
rently used on ferrets:
 OPIOIDS: Examples include buprenorphine, butorphanol, hydromor-
phone, and oxymorphone, and all are injections. These drugs are very
effective for moderate to severe acute, post-surgical, or traumatic pain.
They have a wide range of length of effectiveness, depending on which
drug is used. Mild to profound sedation may accompany the treatment —
the latter being a benefit if the pain is severe or a hindrance if you want
to assess the level of pain. These drugs aren’t good for chronic pain.
 NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs): Examples include
meloxicam, carprofen, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. These oral
medications have anti-inflammatory, pain-reducing, and fever-reducing
properties. They can be effective for some types of acute and chronic
pain. NSAIDs aren’t recommended for ferrets that are pregnant, in shock,
have stomach ulcers, or have kidney or liver disease. NSAIDs may also
worsen gastritis.
 Local anesthetics: Examples include lidocaine and bupivicaine. Vets use
these drugs during surgery at the incision site to help block localized
pain. Local anesthetics are short-term pain killers administered by injec-
tion only.
Tylenol (acetaminophen) is extremely toxic to your ferret, even in very low
doses. It’s metabolized by the liver and will send your ferret reeling into liver
failure quickly before killing him.
Many fuzzy owners and vets explore alternative pain-management tech-
niques, such as the following:
 Acupuncture, which can be very effective at managing certain types of
pain
 Chiropractic care, which is limited to managing pain of the muscu-
loskeletal system
 Herbal/homeopathic care, which may reduce some pain and anxiety.
(Note: This option should be used only under the guidance of a veteri-
nary professional who’s familiar with the use of herbal/homeopathic
medicine and its side effects.)
Use these options only under the direction and with the guidance of your
trusted veterinarian (see Chapter 12).

Setting Up Fuzzy’s Home Hospital Room
You can do non-medical things right at home to help alleviate anxiety and pain
in your ferret. One of the most important parts of your ferret’s treatment occurs
during aftercare, which is where most of the problems begin and end. You can’t
become lax when your ferret needs special care that’s critical to his health.
Whether your ferret is injured, sick, recovering from surgery, or just plain
elderly, you need to give special attention to the old and infirmed. Under the
direction of your vet, you need to give medication exactly as prescribed, pro-
vide assisted feedings routinely, administer fluids when necessary, and so on.
And you have another critical step to take to get your ferret back to his old
self: Make sure he has private space to which he can retreat:
 House him comfortably and in a quiet area.
 Be sure that no other ferrets, pets, or children can bother him.
 Keep his handling to a minimum, and keep it slow and easy.
Most post-surgical, critically ill, elderly, or injured ferrets have limited mobil-
ity or are prescribed restricted mobility by vets. The latter is for their safety
while they heal and recover. Regardless of what your ferret’s story is, he
needs a hospital cage setup. Here’s what you’ll need:
 One cage approximately 2.5'-wide x 2'-deep x 2'-tall
The cage should have easy access to move in and out and have a big
enough spot for a small litter box. It can have a small ramp leading to a
low shelf, but a single story is preferable (see Chapter 5).
 One small litter box
 Litter or shredded newspaper (for ferrets with incisions)
 A water bottle or water bowl
Use a water bottle if your ferret is drinking on his own; a water bowl if
he’s too weak to use a bottle.
 Food dish (if he’s eating on his own)
 Plenty of fluffy bedding
 His favorite toys
Your ferret needs to feel safe and comfortable, but you need to be able to
check up on him often and provide him with the special one-on-one care he
needs. The whole point of the hospital setup is to provide a safe recuperating
spot for your ferret that’s also convenient enough for you to do what you
need to for your ferret. You also want to be able to get to your ferret quickly
in case he’s in distress. Therefore, forego putting any kind of nest box in the
hospital cage. A nice pile of fluffy bedding is all that he needs for now.
216
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

To help with your fuzzy’s need for security and sleep, cover the recovery
cage with a towel or blanket. This will also help keep out drafts.
Feeding the Sick or Debilitated Ferret
Most ferret owners will, at some point, need to assist their ferrets when it
comes to eating so that they continue to meet their nutritional and water-
intake requirements (see Chapter 8). Your ferret may require supplemental
feedings if he’s sick or injured, old, has dental problems, or is recovering
from surgery. No matter the reason, you need to follow through on assisted
feeding four to six times a day if your fuzzy isn’t eating on his own. The fol-
lowing sections give you the recipe so you can create a meal that will help
heal or sustain your ferret and the method for feeding your needy fuzzy
safely and effectively.
The Assist Feed Recipe: Better than 
Mom’s chicken soup
You need to make a special food mixture to feed your sick or debilitated
ferret. The recipe I present in this section has been called many silly names
that have nothing to do with ferrets. For our purposes, I’ll simply call the
recipe the Assist Feed Recipe and hope it catches on. It’s relatively simple to
make. The only requirements are that the concoction must be soft, easy to
digest, full of energy-boosting calories, healthy, and yummy enough to make
your ferret forget about resisting it.
You have several options when it comes to making the Assist Feed Recipe.
Susan Brown, DVM, and co-author of Essentials of Ferrets: A Guide for
Practitioners (American Animal Hospital Association), offers the following
“either or” suggestions:
1. Mix up Carnivore Care as directed.
Highly digestible protein sources make Carnivore Care an ideal choice
when providing nutrition to ferrets that aren’t eating or need supplemen-
tal feedings. It’s made by Oxbow Company and can be purchased from
your vet or directly from the company. You should have a small supply of
this in your ferret first-aid kit (see Chapter 12). If you don’t, before you
pick up the Carnivore Care, you can substitute your ferret’s favorite high-
quality kibble and grind it up, mixing it with water.
217
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

or
2. Mix Carnivore Care with Ensure or Resource 2.0 rather than water to
increase calories and palatability.
You may need to add a smidge of water to thin the mixture a little.
or
3. Mix the Carnivore Care as directed and mix in canned Science Diet
A/D (no more than 50 percent of the total volume) to increase the fat
and flavor.
or
4. Mix the Carnivore Care as directed and add some meat baby food 
(no more than 25 percent of the total volume) to put in more fat and
flavor.
Baby food is the least complete thing you can feed your ferret for the
long term.
or
5. Mix the Carnivore Care as directed and add an all-meat canned cat
food (no more than 25 percent of the total volume) for more fat and
flavor.
If your ferret is extra picky, you can also try a 50/50 mixture of kibble and
Carnivore Care. The key is to find a flavor that’s palatable to your ferret so
that he wants to eat the food. As long as your main ingredient (good high-
quality protein, low-carb kibble, or Carnivore Care) is adequate, you can
experiment with other ingredients.
Mix the batch up until it’s smooth and creamy. If you’re a fuzzy chef extraor-
dinaire, your ferret will lick your concoction right from the spoon or bowl
with little hesitation. If you’re a disaster in the kitchen, you may have to use a
feeding syringe to get the stuff into his mouth. Expect a little ptooeying in
this case. And see the next section for suggestions on how best — and how
often — to get the food down.
Susan Brown would like me to give you the following advice: “Any of these
supplements, even A/D alone or baby food alone, is fine for the short term
(one week or less) or supplementing a ferret that is also still eating some on
his own. However, if you are feeding the ferret all of the food he’s getting and
it’s going to be long term, I would always opt for Carnivore Care alone or in
some combination. If the ferret is very thin, you can use combo #2 or #3 to
beef him up. You can reduce the amount of Resource/Ensure or A/D if the
ferret gets overweight and go back to just Carnivore Care alone.”
Many published supplemental feeding recipes contain ingredients that aren’t
good for ferrets. Please stay away from the following items in particular:
218
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Sugary items (such as honey, corn syrup, maple syrup, or Nutri-Cal)
 Fruit (dried or otherwise)
 Grains
 Vegetables
If you think about it, your ferret can only fit so much into his stomach. You
can’t waste that space on low-calorie, hard-to-digest, non-dense foods. Your
fuzzy should be eating quality high-calorie food. Additionally, high-sugar
foods are tough on his pancreas and cause his blood-sugar levels to rise and
fall rapidly. You don’t want to add to your fuzzy’s health problems!
The feeding method: Just as effective 
as the airplane into the mouth
The manner in which you feed your fuzzy his Assist Feed Recipe depends on
his level of strength and willingness to eat:
 If your ferret is strong enough and finds the Assist Feed Recipe appetiz-
ing, you can present it to him in a shallow bowl or allow him to lick it one
spoonful at a time. He may even prefer to lick the recipe off your finger.
No matter what, don’t just place him in a cage with the bowl and walk
away. Watch him and make sure that he’s doing more eating than spread-
ing it around his cage or other area. Also, if he has cagemates, be aware
that they’ll probably try to get to the food before he gets his share.
 If your ferret isn’t strong enough to feed himself, you’ll have to feed
him. If you do need to force feed, your first job is to take the word
“force” out of your vocabulary. It’s bad enough that the poor guy is sick.
Don’t make eating an unpleasant experience as well. (From here on out,
I’ll refer to this process as assist feeding, because that’s really what
you’re doing.)
You can obtain a feeding syringe (it has no needle at the end) from your
vet, or you can use an eyedropper (plastic, not glass) to assist feed your
fuzzy. (Note: Eyedroppers can be a bit more time-consuming because
they’re smaller.) Suck up the formula into the syringe and squeeze a small
amount into the corner of your ferret’s mouth. He may crinkle up his
nose and eyes with displeasure or surprise, but don’t give up until you
know he’s had enough. Take the time to wipe his mouth and, if needed,
your face, should the stuff go airborne during a violent ptooeying!
Way too often, fuzzy humans are in a hurry to feed their sick babies.
Forcing large amounts of food into a ferret’s mouth can cause him to
aspirate or choke. Feed him slowly and in small amounts. Let him set the
pace. It may just take him awhile to get used to your cooking!
219
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

Don’t ever give up on a stubborn ferret that refuses to eat. Providing good
nutrition and preventing dehydration are crucial to healing and/or prolonging
the life of your ferret. You may end up with a ton of gunk on your body, but
make sure that your sickie gets several cc’s (3 to 4) of the good stuff four to
six times a day. The feeding frequency can be less if he’s eating a little on his
own in between feedings.
Handling Actual Emergencies
Ferrets are tiny. They dehydrate quickly. They don’t have very much blood, so
they can’t afford to lose much. Basically, fuzzies are stoic creatures, and unfor-
tunately, they hide pain and illness too well. Sometimes, by the time you rec-
ognize a problem, it has become severe. The best prevention is to know your
ferret’s body language and behavior well. Your preparedness can save your
furkid’s life. And, unless the situation is as simple as a toenail cut too close to
the quick, a visit to the vet as soon as possible is always a safe measure.
If your ferret is in pain or scared, he may bite. I can safely assume that your
pet knows and trusts you. Your soft, reassuring voice may help comfort him
and calm him down, but you should still exercise caution. (Head to Chap-
ter 20 for tips on handling an aggressive ferret.)
Familiarize yourself with a nearby after-hours emergency hospital that’s
ferret-knowledgeable in case your ferret needs care when your veterinarian is
unavailable.
In the following sections, I cover actual emergencies that you may encounter
over the lifetime of your ferret. Some are common, such as dehydration and
diarrhea, and others aren’t so common, such as burns and electric shock. But
these sections are designed to give you some basic information to prepare
you for possible encounters with emergencies until you can get to the vet.
Shock
Shock is a common after-effect of traumatic injury or life-threatening illness,
and it can cost your ferret his life. Shock is a serious medical emergency, and
prevention and supportive therapy are essential. Check out the following list
so you can recognize the big signs of shock:
 Rapid breathing
 Lethargy
220
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Shivering
 Fast heartbeat
 Pale nose, skin, and ears
 Skin that’s cool to the touch
 Grey to bluish gums
 Unresponsiveness or extreme anxiety
Don’t attempt to get a ferret in shock to eat or drink. Your fuzzy is having a
hard time breathing, and his swallowing reflex just isn’t there.
Get your fuzzy to the vet as soon as possible, trying to keep him warm on the
way. Upon arrival, let your vet know what measures you’ve already taken and
how your ferret has responded. Often, additional fluids given subcutaneously
by the vet help speed the recovery. If your ferret is in shock due to blood
loss, a blood transfusion from a healthy fuzzy can be lifesaving. It sounds
extreme, but it has been done with great success.
Dehydration
Dehydration occurs because of abnormal fluid loss, which can happen if your
ferret stops drinking or has severe or chronic diarrhea or vomiting. Except in
cases where owners deny or restrict access to water or alter the water’s
taste, dehydration is almost always a sign of a serious underlying illness.
Regardless of the cause, dehydration can be fatal if you don’t address it
immediately.
Some signs of dehydration include the following:
 Dry, tacky gums
 Low urine output
 Weakened state
 Difficulty opening his eyes all the way (constant squinting)
 Loss of sparkle or glossiness in his eyes
Not sure if one of these symptoms means your fuzzy is dehydrated? How can
you find out for sure? Try this technique: Pull up on the skin on the back of
your ferret’s neck or shoulders to make a “tent.” Does the skin stay in this
tented position for a second or more after you let go, or does it snap back to
its original elasticity? Dehydration causes the skin to stay pinched up for a
while and not flatten. The longer it takes his skin to flatten out, the more
dehydrated your ferret is.
221
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

Older ferrets or ferrets with adrenal gland disease lose a good amount of elas-
ticity in their skin. In other words, their skin doesn’t quickly snap back into
place. Because of this, you may get a false result with the previous test, lead-
ing you to think your fuzzy is dehydrated. If your fuzzy is older or has adrenal
gland disease, always look for the other signs of dehydration as well.
The immediate solution is to get fluids back into your ferret and get to your
vet’s office (or an emergency hospital) as soon as possible. By the time you
determine your ferret is dehydrated, the situation has become an emergency
and requires a trip to your vet. All supportive measures simply help stabilize
your ferret until you can get him to professional help. To start, encourage
your fuzzy to drink extra water. Some ferrets enjoy the fruity taste of drinks
such as Pedialyte or Gatorade, and they get the added benefit of consuming
extra electrolytes. Some people believe that warm chicken broth encourages
drinking.
If your fuzzy refuses to drink at all, use a feeding syringe or an eyedropper to
feed him the liquid. Hold your ferret in a normal standing position; don’t tip
him on his back. Be careful not to force too much liquid or squirt too quickly
because he can choke.
Getting enough fluids into a dehydrated ferret is difficult. Often, a vet needs
to administer extra fluids subcutaneously (under the skin) or intravenously
(IV directly into the vein). Always take your ferret to the vet for treatment
and so you can find out what’s making your ferret ill in the first place.
Treating the underlying illness often prevents future bouts of dehydration.
Bleeding
Fuzzies don’t have very much blood in their bodies, so any wound that
bleeds profusely requires immediate medical attention. The following sec-
tions show you how to begin treatment for common bleeding injuries; after
you complete your initial treatment, all wounds or injuries should be looked
at by a veterinarian as soon as possible, no matter the degree of the injury.
Bleeding from the ears, nose, mouth, rectum, or vaginal area is usually a sign
of serious illness or injury. If you notice bleeding from one of these sources,
visit your vet immediately or call a pet emergency hotline if your vet isn’t
available.
Treating injured nails
The most common source of ferret bleeding is a toenail that’s cut too close to
the quick (the pink, veined area of the nail). It’s quite painful for your ferret;
you’ll hear him let out a series of small screeches to let you know that you
screwed up. Here’s how you can fix the mistake:
222
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

1. Talk to him softly and hold him cautiously to inspect the damage 
(see Chapter 20 for tips on holding a potentially aggressive fuzzy).
2. Apply a small amount of styptic powder with your finger to the tip of
the bleeding nail.
3. Press hard for a moment and then release your finger.
4. If the nail is still bleeding, repeat Steps 2 and 3.
Styptic powder burns, and you may tick off your ferret, so be careful. 
Get the powder off your finger quickly because it will burn you, too.
A painless alternative to styptic powder is beeswax. Some people suggest
pressing the nail into a bar of white soap (preferably a mild one). Other
owners use cornstarch or flour to stop nail bleeding. These remedies may
take longer to work, but you won’t put your ferret in any more pain.
Seek veterinary care as soon as possible if your fuzzy suffers more than just a
closely clipped nail; otherwise, the area may become infected. If the nail has
been torn off, don’t use powder to treat the injury. Rather, immediately apply
pressure to the top of the toe, not on the toe tip, and seek veterinary atten-
tion right away. The blood will eventually clot on its own. Torn claws may
need to be removed completely and require stitches, but that’s a worst-case
scenario.
Treating cuts
A laceration on your fuzzy can be serious. Your ferret may need a more exten-
sive exam, stitches, and/or antibiotics to treat the injury, but that should
come immediately after you provide initial care to your fuzzy’s boo-boo.
Remember, ferrets don’t have a lot of blood to lose, so act fast! Follow these
steps:
1. Gently wash the laceration with cold water.
2. Apply gentle but firm pressure on the wound.
Using something clean and dry is important — gauze or a clean wash-
cloth, for instance.
3. If possible, wrap the area with gauze and then use self-stick wrap to
secure it to the wound.
Wrapping may not be possible, however, depending on where the 
wound is.
Make sure that the wrap isn’t too tight. Depending on the cause of the
cut, your ferret may also be suffering from internal injuries that you
can’t see.
4. Head to the vet if the laceration is wide, deep, or appears red or 
irritated.
A wound that won’t stop bleeding needs immediate vet attention.
223
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

Vomiting
Vomiting can occur for several reasons, ranging from ingesting bad food, to
an infection of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, to an intestinal blockage. Keep
a close eye on your vomiting ferret. Sometimes, a small piece of ingested
material will come up with vomit, and then the vomiting will stop. But if your
fuzzy vomits repeatedly and shows the following symptoms, he possibly has
an intestinal blockage:
 Can’t hold down his food
 Shows no interest in food
 Becomes depressed and lethargic
The only way to treat a blockage is to remove the object surgically. Not doing
so may spell death for your ferret. Get to a vet as soon as possible!
Diarrhea (and other fecal issues)
Short bouts of infrequent diarrhea are quite common in ferrets. How can you
tell if you’re dealing with diarrhea? A ferret’s normal stool is slightly soft but
formed. Diarrhea is more liquid in form, and your ferret shows a higher fre-
quency of pooping.
The cause of diarrhea can be very difficult to diagnose. The cause can be as
simple as your ferret indulging in one too many treats (hey, we’ve all been
there). Diarrhea can also be a sign of underlying diseases or illnesses or can
result from changes in diet. An underlying condition may be easy to correct
(influenza, for example) or difficult (eosinophilic gastroenteritis, for instance).
But no matter what the cause, diarrhea can become life threatening because
your fuzzy is losing precious fluids and not absorbing all his food. You need to
get treatment immediately and get to the bottom of the cause.
Diarrhea is cause for alarm if it becomes serious and frequent (lasts for more
than a day). If your fuzzy’s diarrhea persists, take him and a sample of the
poop to the vet immediately so she can rule out all the nasty things your
fuzzy may have. The treatment may be as simple as daily doses of Kaopectate
and electrolyte-replacing fluids, but let your vet decide. A professional can
learn a lot just from looking at a ferret’s poop! Table 13-1 goes through the
many properties a sick fuzzy’s poop can have and lists the possible condi-
tions associated with them. Be on the lookout!

that causes rapid passage or diarrhea can cause green
poop — disease, food changes, stress, ECE (see Chap-
ter 16), and so on.
Bloody poop
Fresh, bright-red blood usually comes from the lower intes-
tine or rectum. Large amounts of blood may indicate a
massive hemorrhage from the entire length of the GI tract.
Seedy poop
A non-specific type of poop. Malabsorption or maldigestion
is taking place, meaning that digestion or absorption isn’t
happening the way it should. The seedy material is undi-
gested fat and starch complexes. Seedy or “birdseed”
poop can accompany any disease that seriously affects
the small intestine. Low-quality ferret diets that are high in
plant protein as opposed to animal protein may cause
seedy poop, because the ferrets can’t digest all the plant
protein and starches.
Black, tarry poop
Results from gastric bleeding or gastric ulcers. The black
color comes from the digestion of the blood, which occurs
in the stomach. Significant bleeding in the stomach must
be present in order for the ferret’s poop to turn black.
To check for lower GI blood in your ferret’s poop to be sure, take a poop
sample and put it in a piece of gauze. Soak the gauze in warm water. If blood
is in the stool, the water will turn red, and you’ll see the color against the
white gauze.
In the case of treating severe diarrhea, your vet will request a complete his-
tory of your ferret in order to diagnose the cause. Be prepared to report the
following:
 The age of the ferret
 How the ferret is living and with whom
 The extent and duration of his symptoms
 His diet
 Other significant information you can readily give
225
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

Your vet may also want to perform blood tests, X-rays, or biopsies of the
intestinal tract to help hone in on a proper diagnosis. Your vet will likely treat
your ferret immediately for dehydration and may provide additional nutri-
tional support before moving on to a treatment based on the diagnosis and
the severity of the condition.
Seizures
A seizure occurs when the electrical impulses in the ferret’s brain misfire. It
can last from seconds to a few minutes and is a very scary thing to witness.
Some seizures can occur very quietly and go unnoticed, but the majority
involve the involuntary thrashing about of the limbs in combination with any
of the following:
 Loss of bladder/bowel control
 Salivating
 Vomiting
 Involuntary vocalizations
Seizures can be a sign of many different underlying conditions, from hypo-
glycemia (low blood sugar) to poisoning. They always merit a trip to the vet-
erinarian’s office immediately afterward, because you need to find the
underlying cause and do everything you can to prevent future seizures.
I would only move a ferret if it’s in a place that’s dangerous. If he’s already on
the floor, leave him alone. In moving him, you may prolong the seizure or get
yourself bitten. It’s better to cover him with a light towel or washcloth to
block out the light, which is a stimulus. Covering him may decrease the
length of the seizure. Keep your fingers, pens, wallet, and any other objects
away from your ferret’s mouth when he’s in the middle of the seizure and
shoo away other ferrets and pets. If you have your wits about you, try to time
the incident for future reference. (Note: Neither people nor ferrets have the
ability to swallow their tongues during a seizure. That’s a myth.)
A ferret isn’t in pain during a seizure, even if he’s crying out. He’s essentially
unconscious and his body is going through involuntary muscle spasms. Don’t
try to hold your ferret down during a seizure. Restraining him can cause fur-
ther injury — to him and to you. He may inadvertently and seriously bite you
without even knowing what’s going on around him. Because the jaws of a
seizing animal/person clamp tightly shut, anything that gets in the way gets
bitten severely. Also, restraining him is stimulating and may increase the
length of the seizure.
226
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

In the end, you’ll have a very wiped-out ferret. When your ferret’s seizure
ends, keep him calm, warm, and quiet. He’ll be confused and shaken. To give
him a needed boost to recovery, rub a little Karo syrup or honey on his gums.
Repeat every five minutes until your fuzzy starts coming around. You can
also offer him a little soft food, such as a high-protein canned food or meat
baby food, to stabilize his blood sugar. If your ferret isn’t feeling up to licking
from a spoon or off a plate, offer the food from a feeding syringe. From start
to finish, the ferret needs about 30 to 40 minutes to recover from the seizure,
but get your ferret into the vet as soon as possible after the seizure ends.
Heatstroke
Ferrets are extremely susceptible to heatstroke — especially in temperatures
above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A heatstroke can quickly kill your ferret if you
don’t provide treatment immediately. Signs of heatstroke include
 Heavy panting
 Mucous coming from the nose or mouth
 Extreme lethargy or limpness
 Seizures
 Loss of consciousness
Your main objective is to lower the ferret’s body temperature slowly. A gradual
decrease in body temperature is necessary to prevent shock. (A rapid decrease
in body temperature can be as deadly as heatstroke itself.) First, get the ferret
out of the sun and heat and give him water to drink. If you have an electrolyte-
replacing drink, such as Pedialyte or Gatorade, use it if your ferret will drink it.
If your ferret is unconscious, don’t try to get any liquid or food into his
mouth, because he can choke. Just keep him cool and provide first aid until
you can get him to the vet.
After you remove fuzzy from the heat and get some fluids in him, you can
slowly lower his body temperature in many different ways:
 Apply cool (not cold) water to body areas with less fur — the groin,
lower stomach, and the feet, for example. You can place a wet washcloth
on the key areas. The evaporation of the water on the skin cools the
body and lowers his temperature.
 Place your fuzzy directly in shallow, room-temperature water, keeping
his head and the top half of his body above water. Don’t submerge him
in cold water because the shock of doing so can kill him.
 Apply rubbing alcohol to his feet only, making sure not to miss his paw
pads. You also can rub ice cubes on the ferret’s feet.
227
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

 Place the ferret in front of a fan. This method isn’t as effective as the
others, but it’s better than nothing in an emergency situation.
No matter how you think your ferret is weathering the situation and respond-
ing to your treatment, get him to the vet as soon as possible. Often, the vet will
give a ferret additional fluids to make up for those lost during the heatstroke.
She may also recommend additional medications or other home support.
Take extra precautions in the warmer months to prevent heatstroke. Don’t
leave your ferret in a closed-up, hot car. Keep your ferret and his carrier out
of direct sunlight, and be sure to give him extra water. If you take your ferret
outside during the very warm months, bring along a bottle or two of frozen
water. Wrap the bottles in towels and keep them in the carrier or cage.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is a potentially fatal condition where the body’s temperature
drops below the level required for normal functioning of the internal organs.
Some animals are more prone to hypothermia than others: Very young and
very old ferrets, small ferrets with short hair, ferrets with no shelter in cold
weather, wet ferrets, and ferrets undergoing surgical procedures. Signs of
hypothermia include
 Shivering (which often becomes violent)
 Cool skin or skin cold to the touch
 Slow, shallow breathing
 Lethargy
 Unresponsiveness
The hypothermic ferret needs immediate help from you to return his body
temperature to normal. Depending on the duration and severity of the condi-
tion, tissue damage may already have occurred, so hypothermic ferrets
should be warmed up very slowly. The following list presents some ways to
accomplish this:
 Run dry towels through the dryer to warm them up, and then wrap your
ferret in the warm towels.
A severely hypothermic ferret will be listless and unresponsive and
therefore unable to move away from heat that you provide. Exercise
extreme caution when you provide heat for a ferret so that you prevent
burns. What feels warm to you may actually feel scorching to a ferret.
Monitor the use of heat closely and keep watch over your ailing ferret to
gauge his reactions.
 If your ferret is wet, use a hair dryer on the low setting to dry him and
warm him up.
228
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Fill empty bottles, such as soda bottles, with warm water, wrap them in
dish towels, and place them against your ferret’s skin. The best placement
is where your fuzzy has less fur, such as the armpit or the groin area.
Never put an uncovered bottle against the ferret’s skin; it may burn him.
 Warm a heating pad on the low setting, place a towel over it, lay your
ferret on top of it, and then cover him with a warm towel.
Heating pads can be dangerous because they’re the most common cause
of overheating. Never leave your ferret unattended on a heating pad, and
always keep checking the temperature of the pad and your ferret.
 Grab some sealable plastic baggies or socks and fill them with uncooked
rice or lentils. Warm them in the microwave for one to two minutes,
wrap them in a towel, and place them on areas with little fur.
When you come inside from extreme cold, it’s hard to ignore how painful
your fingers and toes are. Well, a severely hypothermic ferret may experience
similar pain as his tissues warm up. As a result, he may bite or scratch at the
areas and may even bite you in his time of discomfort. Be extra cautious
when handling the fuzzy (see Chapter 20).
While your ferret is warming up, call your vet to discuss what else you should
do. She may want to see your ferret for further examination. Additional vet-
erinary care may include administering warm fluids intravenously and giving
oxygen.
Lethargy and unresponsiveness also are common signs of hypoglycemia that
goes along with insulinoma. It isn’t uncommon for a hypoglycemic ferret to
become hypothermic. If this situation happens with your fuzzy, take steps to
warm him up, and if he’s conscious and can swallow, give him a small amount
of honey or sugar mixed with a little warm water. If he’s unconscious, gently
rub honey or sugar water on his gums. These actions may just save his life!
Eye injuries
Ferrets can get very rough when playing with each other, and they can get
into a lot of trouble on their own. Eye injuries aren’t beyond the ferret injury
realm. If your ferret receives a scratch to an eye, flush out the eye with cool
water or a saline solution. Any eye injury requires the attention of an experi-
enced ferret vet, so waste no time after flushing the eye.
If you suspect that your fuzzy has foreign matter in his eye, such as litter or
sand — which you can tell by a watery and squinty eye that lasts for more
than an hour or so — don’t apply pressure to the affected eye. Doing so can
cause the particle to inflict further damage. Simply flush the eye and call your
vet for instructions on how to proceed until you can get to the office.
229
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

Fractures or spinal injuries
Ferrets are extremely flexible and resilient, but occasionally bone injuries
occur after a fall, after getting pounced on by a dog, or while getting folded
up in a piece of furniture, for instance. If your ferret has a broken bone or an
injured spine, he may be showing the following symptoms:
 Limping
 Showing resistance to moving
 Dragging a leg or holding one up
Sometimes, it’s hard to recognize a break without an actual X-ray, so a trip to
the vet is necessary. The best course of action is to keep your ferret immo-
bile and quiet while you seek immediate medical attention. Don’t try to fix
anything on your own. Place your ferret in a small carrier and keep him warm
during the trip.
If the injured body part is a paw, wrap it in a towel to steady the limb while
you take the fuzzy to the vet. If you suspect his spine is injured, be extremely
cautious. Spinal injuries can be devastating, if not fatal, so keep the ferret as
still as possible in his small carrier. Wrap his body in a towel and get him to
the vet immediately.
Poisoning
The world is a scary place for ferrets; even your home can be a source of
harm. Most homes contain funky chemicals and cleaners, half of which
humans don’t remember storing. These chemicals and cleaners are poisonous
to the little fuzzy. The most commonly encountered ferret poisons are rat
poison and Tylenol. When your ferret finds and ingests these things, disaster
ensues. Poisoning can also occur if you accidentally overdose your ferret on a
prescribed medication.
Signs of poisoning include
 Vomiting
 Salivating
 Pawing at the mouth
 Diarrhea
 Lethargy
 Sudden weakness
 Seizures
230
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Unconsciousness
 An overturned chemical bottle or chewed up cleaner container (okay, so
not a symptom, but definitely a warning signal)
If you suspect that your ferret has ingested something poisonous or has
taken too much medicine, take him and the suspected substance to your vet
immediately. Try to figure out how much he ingested and how long ago so
you can tell the vet. Treatment depends on the ingested substance. It can
range from induced vomiting to medication. Only your vet will know the
proper course of action.
Keep the number to the National Animal Poison Control Center close at hand
and make sure that your vet has it for reference. You can reach this nonprofit
agency at 888-426-4435. The service costs $55 per case and accepts credit
cards only.
Animal bites
People who own ferrets often have other animals in their homes. If you live in
this type of home, you need to limit and monitor pet interactions closely to
avoid bouts of aggression. If your ferret gets bitten by another household pet,
wash his wound lightly with cold water and gently dab the area with hydro-
gen peroxide. If the wound is bleeding, apply pressure to slow the bleeding
and get him to the vet immediately.
Cat bites are particularly dangerous to both people and ferrets due to the
amount of bacteria in cat saliva. Often, cat bites require special antibiotics. If
your kitty bites your fuzzy, make an extra-quick trip to the vet.
If a neighbor’s pet, a stray, or a wild animal bites your ferret, take him to the
vet right away. If you know the animal that bit your fuzzy, find out if it’s up to
date on its rabies vaccination first. Although the incidence is extremely low
and unlikely, your ferret can contract rabies from an infected animal.
Prevention is the key. Watch your ferret closely for changes in behavior and
report them to the vet. (For information on rabies vaccine and prevention,
see Chapter 12.)
Electric shock
An electric shock can be severe enough to kill your little fuzzy. Electric shock
is usually the result of a fuzzy chewing on electrical cords, which is why you
need to keep cords in your home far out of your ferret’s reach (see Chapter 6
for info on ferret-proofing your house). Be aware that chewed cords can also
cause a fire. Check your home regularly for and replace any frayed or bitten
electrical cords.
231
Chapter 13: Helping Your Hurt Ferret: First-Aid Basics

There’s very little you can do for a ferret that’s experienced electric shock
except keep him warm and quiet until you can get him to the veterinarian. If
he’s lucky enough to survive, you can be almost certain he’ll suffer damage to
his teeth, gums, and mouth. You and your vet will then proceed with the
proper treatment program for his injuries. Trust me, prevention is much
easier on both of you!
Burns
Sometimes carpet sharks get into things they shouldn’t (actually, more often
than sometimes). It isn’t their fault; it’s in their nature. One serious side effect
of this curiosity, burns, occurs because owners aren’t paying close enough
attention and allow the fuzzies to venture into unsafe territory. Burns can
come from getting too close to fireplaces, cigarettes, ovens, and even pilot
lights. Bathing your ferret in extremely hot water can also scald him. If your
ferret suffers a burn, immediately apply cold water directly to the burned
area. And if you can, apply an ice pack for no more than five minutes. After
this initial treatment, get your ferret to the vet immediately.

Ferreting Out Ferret Pests
In This Chapter
 Eradicating external pests
 Zapping away internal bugs
S
imply put, a parasite is an organism (or person) that feeds off another
organism without giving anything back. You may even know one or two
personally! Every living being is host to a parasite party or two — or maybe a
hundred. Parasites come in all shapes and sizes. Some are internal, and some
are external. Some are harmless and hardly noticeable; others can be quite
damaging and difficult to miss.
This chapter deals specifically with external and internal pests that can bug
the heck out of your fuzzy. I list these parasites and their warning signs and
give you tips on keeping your fuzzy critter-free. I also shed some light on para-
sites, diseases, and germs that can affect both humans and their better halves,
the carpet sharks.
Booting External Critters That 
Go Bite in the Night
They’re ruthless and always hungry. Under a microscope, they look a bit like
creepy prehistoric monsters. They’re external parasites. Can anything be
more annoying to the pet and pet owner than external parasites? Nothing
that I know of. These incredibly sturdy little ectoparasites need little to sur-
vive, and unfortunately, you and your ferret can be hosts to these ungrateful
diners. In the sections that follow, I introduce many common external para-
sites that you must combat, and I give you the ammunition to kick them off
your and your fuzzy’s dinner table — namely, your skin.

Fleas
Fleas are the most common external parasites seen on ferrets. They spend
most of their time building flea resorts in your rugs and couches and in any
other cozy place they can find. One such cozy place is in your fuzzy’s coat.
Ferrets are just as prone to flea infestations as Fidos and Tabbys. But before
you can safely rid your domain of these blood-sucking pests and prevent
them from turning your frisky ferret into an illing itchy, you need to know
what kind of army you’re dealing with:
 Fleas are messy guests. The act of feasting on your pet’s warm blood
triggers the female flea to lay thousands of eggs all over your home.
Sometimes, you may observe a flea scurrying across its dinner table:
your pet. More likely, you’ll see only the end results of the flea’s wild par-
ties: the “flea dirt” left on the skin of your pet. This “dirt” is actually flea
waste, which looks like tiny specks of reddish-black sand.
 Fleas are opportunistic little buggers. Where there is wildlife, there are
fleas. And plenty of them. Fleas can hitchhike right into your home on
other pets, and although they can’t live on humans, they can hitch a ride
on your clothing or a picnic blanket, perhaps. And don’t forget about the
greatly appreciated, supervised trips your ferret takes to the wonderful
outdoors. Through no fault of her own, your ferret may bring fleas into
your house.
 Fleas love warm, humid places. Fleas seek all warm-blooded victims.
Although it may be warm and humid for only several months a year
where you live, your battle against fleas is year round.
Fleas can be more than a mere nuisance. A severe flea infestation can cause
life-threatening anemia (a reduction in red blood cells, causing fatigue and
weakness) in your ferret. Fleas also can carry parasites such as tapeworms
and pass them along to both you and your fuzzy. The bottom line: If your
ferret has fleas, you need to get rid of them as soon as possible.
The following sections let you know how to check for these annoying critters
and give you steps to take to free your home from their terrible reign.
Checking for fleas
Some indications of a flea infestation include small bites (tiny, red raised
marks) or reddened areas or lesions on the skin due to plenty of scratching.
Severe infestations may bring poor fur quality, thinning patches of fur, and fur
discoloration. You may find yourself suffering some of the same scratching
effects; don’t be surprised if you have some bites around your feet and ankles
if the infestation is severe (fleas can jump over 100 times their body length).
Herein lies one of the biggest problems with fleas: Their tiny bites are
painfully itchy. To a flea-allergic pet, the situation can be almost unbearable
as she scratches out her skin and her underbelly becomes irritated.
234
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

To check your fuzzy for fleas, ruffle back her fur with your hands and exam-
ine her skin closely — particularly the belly. You should also inspect your
ferret’s bedding and change it often. You can shake out her towels or other
bedding onto a white floor or a piece of paper and then distinguish the
specks of kitty litter from the flea dirt.
Ridding your ferret and home of fleas
After you discover that fleas have invaded your home, you need to act to get
rid of them as quick as you can. The steps in the following sections give you
the how-to. Before you treat your ferret for fleas, however, keep the following
points in mind:
 If one of your pets has fleas, all your pets have fleas. If you have sev-
eral pets, you must treat them all, whether or not you see evidence of
fleas on each one.
 What’s safe for a dog may kill your ferret. Controls such as sprays,
dips, and flea collars aren’t meant for fuzzies. Ferrets are hypersensitive
to most of these products — particularly organophosphate pesticides.
Even “ferret-safe” products can be harmful to a sick, geriatric, young
(under 12 weeks old), or nursing ferret.
 You must see a veterinarian before applying any flea product on your
ferret (or any pet, for that matter). Your vet will make sure the product
is safe and that your pet is healthy enough to withstand chemical 
treatment.
Step 1: Treat your ferret
To rid your ferret and home of fleas, begin by bathing all your warm-blooded
furry pets with safe flea shampoos. After you purchase a ferret-safe flea
shampoo — preferably one made with pyrethrins or other natural 
ingredients — follow these steps:
1. Gently bathe your ferret from head to toe — and remember the tail
(tails have fleas, too).
Refer to Chapter 9 for detailed information on bathing your ferret. Here
are some highlights: Don’t forget your goggles, snorkel, and shoulder-
length rubber gloves, and remember to prevent the shampoo from get-
ting into the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.
2. When your ferret is dry, use a flea comb to remove any flea corpses
from her coat.
3. Move the fuzzy to a warm, dry, flea-free place before you tackle 
her cage.
A travel carrier works well in times like these. After all, putting a squeaky-
clean furball into a flea-infested cage doesn’t make much sense.
235
Chapter 14: Ferreting Out Ferret Pests

Step 2: Treat your ferret’s cage, bedding, and other stuff
When your ferret is bathed and flea-free, you’re ready to tackle her cage and
bedding. (Note: You have to do the same with your other pet stuff, too.)
Follow these steps to treat these fuzzy fixtures:
1. Remove all bedding from the cage and machine wash it in hot water.
If you prefer, you can place it in a sealed plastic bag and throw it away.
2. Scrub the cage thoroughly with hot, soapy water and then dry.
3. Spray the cleaned, dry cage with a cat-safe flea spray and allow it to
thoroughly dry.
Step 3: Treat your home
The third step — treating your entire home — is probably the most inconve-
nient and time-consuming of all the steps. You may have killed the fleas on
your ferret and the eggs on her bedding, but thousands of eggs may be get-
ting ready to hatch all over your house, including in the baseboards, carpet-
ing, and furniture.
You have several options for treating your home for fleas. The easiest way is
to hire a professional exterminator. Other hands-on methods are foggers,
sprays, and powders that you apply. As you decide what method to use, keep
in mind that ferrets are remarkably sensitive to chemicals, so choose the
safest and most natural method whenever possible. And always follow prod-
uct directions when going it alone.
Before treating the environment with sprays or powders, it’s imperative that
you completely remove all your pets, including your ferret (and her cage/toys/
bowls), from the premises until everything settles and dries. It isn’t good for
your ferret to be walking through wet sprays or having the powders settling
on her body/stuff. Nor is it healthy for her to inhale the chemicals. Follow the
directions on the bottles/can before returning your pet to your home.
Because most commercial flea-killing products don’t successfully kill all the
eggs, larvae, and pupae, you may need to repeat this step 7 to 21 days after
the first treatment, depending on which product you use. Make sure you
acquire the advice of an expert.
Step 4: Stop fleas from coming back
You must make a regular effort to prevent reinfestation after you take the first
few steps to treat for fleas. Here are some general suggestions:
 Keep your pet’s environment clean by vacuuming and scrubbing 
regularly.
236
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Empty the vacuum bag after vacuuming each time, because fleas can
survive in the bag and continue to lay eggs. The babies will hatch and
leave the vacuum.
 Inspect and de-flea all incoming pets before they enter your home.
The following list presents products that you should use only in conjunction
with your vet’s blessing:
 Advantage (Bayer): Made with the ingredient imidacloprid, Advantage is
said to kill 98–100 percent of the fleas within 24 hours.
Applying a small amount of the liquid directly on the skin at the base of
your ferret’s skull provides up to 28 days of protection. The liquid
spreads evenly across your ferret’s skin to provide full-body coverage.
Monthly applications are advised to protect against newly hatching
fleas. Reapplication is recommended after bathing, but your ferret
should receive no more than one application per week.
 Frontline Top Spot (Merial): Made with the active ingredient fipronil,
this product targets both fleas and ticks (see the following section). It’s
designed to be continually released onto the ferret’s skin and fur for at
least one full month after initial application.
Frontline Top Spot becomes waterproof two days after application;
therefore, don’t bathe your ferret during this period. If you must bathe
your ferret before applying the product, wait at least five days after the
bath before applying Frontline Top Spot. Some ferret owners prefer to
use the Frontline spray because it’s easier to dose.
One reason Frontline Top Spot is deemed so safe for mammals is
because it isn’t absorbed into a pet’s bloodstream. Like Advantage,
Frontline should be applied monthly.
 Revolution (Pfizer): Made with the active ingredient selamectin,
Revolution is a topically applied product that prevents heartworm, kills
adult fleas, prevents flea eggs from hatching, and treats and controls ear-
mite infestation. It’s also said to treat and control sarcoptic mange.
Unlike Advantage and Frontline, Revolution enters the bloodstream and
tissues through the skin. You can bathe your pet after letting Revolution
absorb for four hours. Talk to your vet about the correct dosage for your
ferret.
Revolution has a very low adverse-reaction rate, and when compared to
other products on the market, Revolution has the broadest spectrum of
prevention and treatment of parasites.
The wonderful thing about these products is that they kill the fleas before
they lay eggs. If you stick with one of the products with all your pets, chances
are you won’t often (if ever) need to go through the frenzied treatment
process I describe in the previous sections.
237
Chapter 14: Ferreting Out Ferret Pests

Ticks
Ticks look like tiny brown crabs. When filled with blood, they resemble a
raised mole on the skin. Ticks will appear without warning. They don’t gener-
ally occur as an infestation, but rather as a single incident; perhaps you’ll find
up to several at a time if your ferret has been walking through infested brush
areas. You should always check for ticks carefully after walks. The ticks may
be flat, attached, but not yet filled with blood. Or they may be attached and
already starting to fill up.
Here are a couple things to know about ticks:
 Finding ticks can be difficult. You must feel beneath the fur for the tiny
lumps. Ears are also great hiding spots for ticks.
 Ticks can harbor some diseases, including Lyme disease, that can affect
both humans and other animals. Some spot-on products (see the previ-
ous section) used to control fleas are also effective in killing ticks.
Fortunately, ticks are relatively easy to deal with. If you find one hitched to
your fuzzy’s skin, follow these steps:
1. Using a pair of tweezers or forceps, grab the tick as close to the
ferret’s skin as possible.
2. Gently pull off the tick, being sure not to leave the tick’s barbed
mouth parts still attached to the fuzzy’s skin.
3. After removal, crush or burn the tick.
Don’t burn the tick off of your ferret. Many people suggest this, but you run
the risk of seriously burning your fuzzy.
Cuterebra flies
Cuterebra flies, which don’t bite or sting, look like big hunched-back bumble-
bees. They lay their eggs along well-traveled paths and around the burrows
of typical hosts, such as rabbits and rodents. The heat and moisture emitted
from the host animals as they pass by triggers the eggs to hatch into larvae,
called warbles. Although ferrets aren’t the main target hosts, they can
become infested when they’re playing outside.
The tiny warbles enter the ferret’s mouth or nose or sometimes through a
tiny open wound on its skin. Contrary to some beliefs, warbles can’t burrow
into the healthy skin of an animal from the outside. Warbles can remain in the
nose or mouth for several days before migrating to various spots beneath the
skin where they pupate — usually on the head, neck, or trunk. The warbles
remain under the skin for approximately 30 days while they undergo some
astonishing changes.
238
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

As a warble enlarges, a swelling beneath the skin begins to appear, which is
when you should notice a problem. Depending on the stage of growth, a
warble can range in size from a few millimeters to a couple of centimeters. The
lesion looks a little like an abscess, but if you look closely, you’ll see a tiny
opening at the top of it, which is where the larva breathes in air. Occasionally,
you may see a discharge coming from the opening, but this isn’t common. You
may see your ferret biting or scratching at the lump, or his fur around the
lump may be matted.
To treat the warble, you need to head to the vet’s office. Your vet needs to
enlarge the wound and remove the warble carefully so as not to rupture it. 
A rupture can cause a secondary infection or trigger the ferret’s immune
system to attack the material as if it was a foreign body. The resulting wound,
when thoroughly cleaned, should remain open during the healing process.
New, healthy tissue will slowly fill in the hole. Your vet will give you all the
details about caring for the wound after his work is done.
Ear mites
Blood-sucking ear mites are common in ferrets. You can identify the issue by
checking your fuzzy’s ear canals for brownish-black gunk. Ferrets with ear
mites may show the following symptoms:
 Scratching feverishly at their ears
 Walking with a slight head tilt
 Shaking their heads due to the extreme discomfort
Their ears may also stink and be slightly discolored.
Treatment for ear mites is relatively easy (if you stick with it) and is neces-
sary to prevent secondary infections that can be extremely painful and even
result in deafness. Some vets may prescribe an ear ointment such as
Tresaderm. Others may use injectible ivermectin. Ivermectin (the same as
injectible ivermectin) mixed with propylene glycol or used by itself and
applied directly into the ear canal also works. You can even use Revolution,
which is a flea treatment I discuss in the earlier flea section.
Here are some other things you need to know about ear mite treatment:
 Ear mites can pass between fuzzies and other household pets and vice
versa, so it’s important to treat all animals.
 Wash all bedding frequently during treatments.
 You can’t eradicate ear mites with one application of medicine; you have
to use a series of applications. A minimum of two treatments, 7 to 10 days
apart, is usually necessary, so it’s crucial to be painstakingly thorough.

Chapter 14: Ferreting Out Ferret Pests

Medications designed to kill the mites won’t kill the eggs, which is why
you have to repeat treatment. Mites hatch out after the first treatment.
The second treatment kills the second batch of mites before they have a
chance to lay eggs again and start the cycle over.
Sarcoptic mange (scabies)
As someone who’s suffered from the dreadful pest known as sarcoptic mange
(scabies), I can testify that the condition is unbearably itchy and definitely no
fun. This external bug is in the mite family and passes quite easily from
animal to animal or from animal to human. Depending on your ferret’s case,
her symptoms may include itchy patches of hair loss on the belly, face, or
legs or crusty skin with oozing, pimple-like sores. Sometimes, the scabies
infestation attacks only the feet and toes, causing severe inflammation.
Marked by scabby, swollen, red feet, foot rot often results in the claws falling
out if left untreated. A vet can make a diagnosis with skin scrapings.
For treatment, you can choose really, really stinky vet-prescribed lime sulfur
dips and shampoos, or you can go the simple route with oral or injectible
ivermectin. You can also use Revolution, which I discuss in the earlier flea
section.
Battling the Internal Bugaboos 
That Threaten Your Fuzzy
It’s bad enough that pests want to invade the outside of your little fuzzbutt,
but some also want to take over your fuzzy’s insides. Some internal parasites
can be life threatening and require immediate attention. You must stay vigi-
lant for the warning signs and always take your little one to the vet if you sus-
pect that something’s wrong. In the following sections, I introduce some
dangerous internal parasites and detail the warning signs that wave red flags
so you can rush your fuzzy to the vet.
Never, ever take on the role of doctor and medicate your ferret without your
vet’s guidance. Ferrets are tiny creatures and can overdose very easily. Some
medications can be lethal in certain combinations. Also, you may cause more
harm if you misdiagnose or fail to see other underlying health problems.
Don’t be hasty. Always get help from an experienced ferret vet who can diag-
nose and come up with the proper course of action (see Chapter 12 for more
on finding one).

Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Intestinal worms
Ferrets are susceptible to many intestinal worms, including roundworms,
hookworms, tapeworms, flukes, and lungworms. Almost all intestinal infesta-
tions harbor the same symptoms:
 Dry, brittle fur
 Weight loss
 Diarrhea, mucousy or bloody poops, and/or worms in the poop (in rare,
serious infestations)
 Abdominal bloating
 Weakness or lethargy
 Itchy heinie
 Increased appetite with weight loss
 Increased gas
 Tender belly
Some intestinal worms are passed from one animal to another or to a human
through an animal’s infected poop. Some, like tapeworm, are passed through
fleas or other intermediate hosts. Others can get into the system just by
having their tiny larva burrow through the skin.
Although the symptoms generally are the same, treatment of intestinal para-
sites can vary depending on the organism you’re dealing with. Some worms
require oral medication in liquid or pill form. Others can fall to an injection
(often ivermectin). Whatever the case, intestinal parasites left untreated can
cause your ferret to have chronic intestinal problems and be prone to poor
health. In rare instances, severe cases of intestinal worms can cause death.
If you have more than one ferret and one of them has internal parasites,
chances are you have more than one wormy fuzzy. Treat all your ferrets thor-
oughly, according to your vet’s instructions. Don’t forget to change their litter
boxes and clean the cage to prevent reinfestation. If you also have dogs and
cats, check them for parasites, too. Animals just love to get into poop!
Giardia
Giardia, a lovely protozoan, can get into you or your ferret via a water source
(streams, lakes, ponds, and infected tap water, for example) or through the
ingestion of infected poop. After gaining access to the intestinal tract, these
buggers attack the inner lining of the intestine, causing an uncomfortable
inflammation. Signs of giardia infestation include weight loss, bloating, diar-
rhea, and mucousy poops.
241
Chapter 14: Ferreting Out Ferret Pests

Giardia can be difficult to find under the microscope. You need a very fresh
poop sample looked at immediately — like, while it’s still steaming. Better
yet, have your vet take a swab from the rectum. The very best course of
action is to send a sample in a special solution to the lab for proper analysis
and identification. Some people believe giardia is rare in ferrets, but others
believe that it’s very common and only shows its ugly warning signs when
the fuzzy is stressed out. This is one parasite that’s still being investigated.
The treatment suggested by a vet is oral medication — usually Flagyl
(metronidazole). Some vets suggest Panacur (fenbendazole) as another
option, although this medication isn’t made specifically to combat giardia.
For healthy fuzzies, some experts think that the symptoms may go away with-
out treatment. I always suggest getting help. It may take up to a month to
cure your furball, but your effort is well worth it.
Some medications — especially Flagyl and Pepto-Bismol — are so offensive
to fuzzies that they projectile-ptooey them all over you. A treat such as
Linatone can come in handy. Mixing the medication with a yummy supple-
ment can save you a laundry bill and reduce the rebellion on your ferret’s
part. Keep in mind, though, what you’re medicating the fuzzy for in the first
place; for example, ferrets with insulinoma shouldn’t have sweet stuff.
Coccidia (coccidiosis)
Coccidia is a protozoan infection common in ferrets as well as other animals.
The infection is picked up through the ingestion of infected poop and can be
diagnosed by your vet if you provide a stool sample. However, a stool sample
isn’t always a fail-proof test. Your fuzzy may shed the oocysts (eggs) only
periodically, which means you may test a poop on a day when no oocysts
were shed. For the most accurate results, pick a poop that’s bloody and
mucousy.
Severe coccidia infestations can cause diarrhea, lethargy, dehydration,
weight loss, loss of appetite, and, in severe cases, death. Kits (baby ferrets)
are most susceptible to severe coccidia infestations and may have thin, brit-
tle fur and a sparse coat. The kit’s whiskers are stubby and broken off. In pro-
longed conditions, her heinie may appear red and swollen. Treatment often is
successful if you catch the condition early enough. Many vets prescribe
Albon (sulfadimethoxine) to treat coccidia.

Handling Viruses, Infections, and
Other Conditions and Illnesses
In This Chapter
 Addressing many common ferret diseases and conditions
 Finding out what you can do to diagnose and treat your ferret
N
o matter how hard people try to stay healthy with good eating, exer-
cise, and proper immunizations, millions of humans manage to get the
worst viruses, respiratory infections, and flu every year. Your fuzzy is no 
different.
Experts have written entire books on the diseases and illnesses ferrets can
contract. This isn’t one of them. In this chapter, you simply get the basics on
what you need to know about common ferret diseases and what you can do
about them. This chapter deals with the most common diseases and condi-
tions, in alphabetical order, from the simple (flu) to the deadly (rabies) and
from the serious (cardiomyopathy) to the not-so-serious (eye problems). As 
I make clear throughout this book, recognizing changes in your ferret’s
appearance and behavior early on can mean the difference between life and
death. Even some of the presumably innocent conditions I describe in this
chapter can take a turn for the worst or can be indicative of another more
serious condition.
A handful of signs seem to show up with almost all fuzzy ailments, which is
just one more reason to leave the diagnosing and medicating to your experi-
enced vet. Your ferret may be suffering from more than one malady. Also, you
need to be aware that signs aren’t set in stone. Your ferret may exhibit one
sign or a combination of several. She may show none at all, especially in the
beginning stages of an illness. The signs I list in this chapter are the most
common ones for each illness and are here for reference purposes only. Don’t
wait until more signs appear before hauling your fuzzbutt to the vet.

Gastrointestinal (GI) Diseases
Gastrointestinal diseases refer to all those things that can go wrong with the
stomach, intestines, or esophagus. The next few sections cover those GL ail-
ments that can affect ferrets, and what you can do if you spot the symptoms
involved.
Epizootic Catarrhal Enteritis (ECE)
Epizootic Catarrhal Enteritis (ECE) is an inflammation of the intestinal lining.
In addition to the intestinal damage, as the disease progresses, the ferret’s
liver can be seriously affected, and the results can be deadly! Ferrets with
ECE can’t absorb food and water properly, causing life-threatening diarrhea.
The disease is transmitted when a ferret comes in contact with the bodily
fluids or feces of a sick ferret or via handlers of ill ferrets. Experts have strong
evidence that a coronavirus causes ECE.
The fuzzies most at risk are older carpet sharks and very young ferrets.
Ferrets that are already battling other illnesses, such as lymphosarcoma,
adrenal disease, and/or insulinoma (see Chapter 16), also are at high risk.
Healthy young and middle-aged furkids seem to get over ECE the fastest with
the right support, almost as if the condition were the flu. In multi-ferret
homes, you can expect most, if not all, of your fuzzies to get this disease
within 48 to 72 hours after it enters the door. Baby ferrets bought from pet
stores are frequent asymptomatic carriers of ECE, which means they can show
no signs of having the condition. ECE also can enter your home on your
clothes after you’ve handled a ferret with ECE.
This nasty disease can last anywhere from several days to several months. Watch
your ferret closely and get her to a vet the moment the signs become apparent.
ECE is typically diagnosed by its characteristic timeline and clinical signs. 
Prevention
ECE is an extremely contagious disease that spreads from ferret to ferret very
quickly. To safeguard your ferret, you need to clean, clean, clean. Follow
these tips:
 Don’t let other people handle your ferret without taking precautions. 
 Wash thoroughly before and after you handle any ferrets. 
 Change clothing before handling your own little one after visiting with
strange ferrets. 
244
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Make sure all new ferrets you get have been checked by the vet for
parasites and given an overall clean bill of health before exposing them
to others.
Quarantining newcomers for ECE is a bit unrealistic because any ferret can
carry the disease for months and months. If she comes in with it, your other
ferrets will be exposed. That’s the bottom line. Quarantining in this case only
gives you a false sense of security.
Clinical signs
Some typical signs of ECE include the following:
 Diarrhea that’s initially bright green to yellow and full of mucous; it may
be bubbly, foul-smelling, or slimy, and it may or may not be projectile
diarrhea
 Seedy poop, often yellowish in color (indicating undigested food)
 Dehydration, often severe (see Chapter 13 on dehydration)
 Lethargy and sleepiness
 Extreme weight loss (up to 50 percent in severe cases)
 Vomiting
 Squinted, watery eyes (which is a sign of pain)
 Oral and stomach ulcers
 Coma
Treatment
We have no cure for ECE as of press time. Also, no vaccine is currently avail-
able to protect against ECE, although experts are working diligently to
develop one. And because ECE is probably viral, no medication can effec-
tively combat it directly. However, some medications can be useful to manage
some of the secondary effects of the disease, such as intestinal ulcers and
intestinal pain. In addition, secondary bacterial infections may occur in an
already weakened animal, and these too require treatment.
Some medications that have been successful (possibly in certain combina-
tions) in treating secondary infections that occur along with ECE are 
 Amforol
 Amoxicillin
 Clavamox drops
 Cefa drops
 Baytril
245
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

Over-the-counter anti-cramping medications and tummy coaters have been
used in the past for treatment, but they aren’t necessary and may cause more
harm than good. Cimetidine may be used to prevent ulcers and excretion of
excess stomach acid. Some veterinarians use an oral antiviral called “alpha
interferon” with mixed results. 
Treatments vary by degree of illness and should be administered only under
the guidance of your veterinarian. Not all medications work for every ferret.
Your vet may find, through trial and error, the perfect medication to get your
fuzzy through her ordeal. Every case needs to be evaluated on an individual
basis. Please note that treatments of ferrets evolve over time as new medica-
tions are developed and new knowledge of diseases is gained. Your vet
should be aware of current treatment protocols as they become available.
In healthier or younger ferrets, the disease should be treated like the flu
unless signs become severe. The treatment, in addition to the secondary
medications, is more complicated for other ferrets. An affected ferret will die
of dehydration more quickly than she will starve to death, so keeping her
hydrated is the most important part of supportive care. You must combat
serious bouts of dehydration with subcutaneous fluids and/or electrolyte
replacers, such as Pedialyte or Gatorade. Of course, you must pay attention
to feeding your ailing fuzzy, too. The following bullets point out the care 
procedures:
 Your vet should show you how to administer subcutaneous fluids. It
takes 20 CCs or 4 teaspoons of fluids per pound of body weight three
times a day to keep a healthy ferret alive. A dehydrated ferret needs
more than that to stay alive. Your vet should determine how much sub-
cutaneous fluids to administer and when to administer them. It’s impor-
tant to strictly use your vet as your guide, because it’s possible to
overhydrate or drown your ferret in fluids! 
 Supplemental feedings with Assist Feed Recipe (see Chapter 13) three to
four times a day has proven very helpful in supportive care. Assisted
feeding is critical if your ferret isn’t eating on her own. It also plays a
role in reversing fatty liver disease, which is often the result of severe
bouts of ECE. Additionally, assist feeding ensures that your ferret gets
enough nutrition and helps keep her hydrated.
When your ferret is back on her paws again, be aware that her intestinal
lining will be abnormal for some time, even after the signs seem to go
away. She may suffer from periodic bouts of diarrhea and dehydration.
Monitor your recovering fuzzy closely and for several months. Long-
term damage to the lining of the intestinal tract may mean abnormal
stools on and off for quite some time.
Oral fluids are equally important to a recovering ferret, so you can try to give
water via spoon or syringe if your ferret isn’t drinking from a bowl. The Assist
Feed Recipe also will provide some oral fluids.

Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses
Intestinal and stomach blockages
The leading causes of death in ferrets under 2 years old are intestinal and
stomach obstructions. Young ferrets mouth and taste everything from fingers
to foam rubber. But older fuzzies aren’t immune to this affliction. Blockages
can occur when your overzealous carpet shark eats something that’s too big
to pass on through his system. Hairballs frequently cause clogs in ferrets (see
the later “Hairballs” section). No matter the cause, if the ferret’s body can’t
push the blockage out the other end, everything in her system backs up.
Blockages can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, from the throat to the
stomach to the small intestine. Stomach blockages may move around, caus-
ing signs to appear and subside. A clog in the belly can last a long time and
cause a slow wasting away. If it’s a hairball, the mass slowly grows.
Signs
Here are some signs that your fuzzy may be blocked up:
 Constipation
 Tiny poop (looks like string cheese) or black, tarry poop
 Bloating
 Painful belly
 Loss of appetite
 Loss of weight
 Vomiting
 Mouth pawing
 Severe dehydration
 Teeth grinding
 Face rubbing
 Lethargy
 Coma
 Seizuring (occurs after the blockage is complete and has been there 24
hrs or longer)
Diagnosis and treatment
Attempting a diagnosis by feeling around the ferret’s belly isn’t fail-proof.
Sometimes, large tumors cause similar signs and feel like an obstruction.
Often, your vet will confirm your suspicions with an X-ray.

If you suspect that your fuzzy ate something she shouldn’t have and it isn’t
life threatening, you can start giving her Laxatone a couple times a day.
Watch for foreign objects in anything that comes out the other end (if any-
thing poops out). 
Poop mixed with water makes identifying foreign bodies quite a bit easier.
You can put some poop in a small sandwich bag, add a little water, and
squish away!
Keep in mind that it often takes more than Laxatone to fix a blockage prob-
lem. If you don’t see the object coming out, get straight to the vet. Left
untreated, a stopped-up fuzzy can die an agonizing death. Don’t wait until 
the last minute to go to the veterinarian.
Exploratory surgery may be necessary to cure the ailment. After the blockage
moves into the small intestine, surgery is imperative, or else a painful death
can occur within a day or two. Vets recommend a soft diet for several days
following the surgery (see Chapter 8 for tips on changing your ferret’s diet).
Because dehydration from failure to eat and drink is a serious problem,
administering oral or subcutaneous fluids every few hours is imperative.
If you think pumpkin-pie filler is just for Halloween, think again. This stuff is a
great way to flush out your ferret’s intestinal tract. If you think your ferret
could have a blockage, offer her this tasty treat — as much as she wants.
Most ferrets love it! Hopefully, it will flush out any foreign bodies. Word of
caution: This doesn’t work if the ferret’s GI tract is completely blocked. If you
think this is the case, contact your vet immediately.
Helicobacter Mustelae (H. mustelae)
Infection
Helicobacter mustelae (H. mustelae) is a bacterium that resides in the stom-
achs of most ferrets. Although your ferret may harbor it after ingesting conta-
minated poop, she likely got it from mom, because it passes from mom to kit
via exposure to the mom’s poop. Unfortunately, this bacterium can be seri-
ous and cause disease.
Of course, H. mustelae may reside in your ferret’s stomach for a lifetime
without causing any disease. What makes the bug go from benign to gravely
destructive isn’t clear. What is clear is that serious bouts of H. mustelae
infection may result in gastric problems, such as chronic atrophic gastritis.
Some ferret experts believe that this little bug can be serious enough to
248
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

cause gastric ulcers — a theory that has mounting evidence to support it. In
fact, almost all fuzzy ulcer patients are infected with H. mustelae. Most ferrets
adversely affected by H. mustelae are over the age of 4.
Atrophic gastritis is a chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, which leads
to loss in function of many of the cells and the replacement of scar tissue. As
a result, the stomach’s ability to produce stomach acid is impaired, leading to
severe digestive problems.
The presence of the infection causes an inflammation of the stomach lining.
By attaching to the cells responsible for producing the protective mucosal
lining of the stomach, the bacterium hinders the body’s ability to produce
mucous. This makes the stomach vulnerable to strong stomach acid, and the
result can be burns or ulcers. H. mustelae infection also increases the pH of
the stomach and impairs the stomach’s ability to produce stomach acid; the
latter is needed to digest food. 
Here are the signs of an infection:
 Vomiting
 Loss of appetite
 Loose stools
 Excessive salivating
 Dark, tarry stools
 Lethargy
 Teeth grinding
 Painful belly
 Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
 Weight loss
It seems as though a ferret’s own system can control this bacterial invasion
under normal circumstances. Unless your fuzzy becomes extremely stressed
out or is already weakened by disease or illness, the signs may not appear at
all. The relationship between stress, disease, and illness, however, hasn’t
been proven to cause the bacterial rebellion. It’s currently recommended that
you treat only those ferrets that show signs of H. mustelae infection. After the
signs appear, your ferret should be treated by a veterinarian immediately.
Medication combinations that have been successful include Amoxicillin,
Flagyl, and Pepto-Bismol for 4 to 6 weeks, or Biaxin in combination with
Amoxicillin for 2 to 3 weeks. These are just two of the current treatments out
there. Other treatments are available, and there will undoubtedly be new and
improved treatments in the future. 
249
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis most commonly presents as a disease of the
intestinal tract. However, it can involve other organs such as the liver,
abdominal lymph nodes, pancreas, or skin. Eosinophils are a type of white
blood cell that are released when some types of foreign invaders enter the
body. These cells release a substance called histamine in their attempt to do
battle, but unfortunately in large amounts histamine can instead start attack-
ing the tissue around it. Histamines, by the way, are the same substances that
cause your skin to swell after a bee sting. In the intestine they cause damage
to intestinal lining. When the intestinal lining isn’t functioning normally it
can’t absorb nutrients or water properly, resulting in diarrhea and weight
loss. The foreign invaders that cause eosinophilic gastroenteritis are
unknown at this time. Some veterinarians believe a food allergy is involved,
but this hasn’t been as yet substantiated. These vets may suggest a more nat-
ural diet may prevent eosinophilic gastroenteritis or help heal a ferret with
the disease. Again, there is yet no scientific, only anecdotal findings.
Signs of eosinophilic gastroenteritis
The following list presents the common signs of eosinophilic gastroenteritis:
 Severe diarrhea
 Loss of appetite
 Weight loss
 Swollen ears and feet (in severe cases)
 Skin ulcerations (in severe cases)
 Abdominal pain (in severe cases)
Diagnosis and prognosis
Your vet can begin to make a diagnosis after reviewing the gastrointestinal
signs I list in the previous section. Next comes a complete blood-cell count,
which almost always shows a dramatic increase in eosinophils. The predomi-
nant signs coupled with the blood test should be almost conclusive. Definitive
diagnosis, however, can be made by taking biopsies of the affected tissues —
including intestinal or stomach tissue and the lymph nodes around the
intestines. These areas often include large numbers of eosinophils in cases 
of eosinophilic gastroenteritis.
The prognosis should be good if you catch the disease early. With early 
diagnosis, medication and diet can work their magic and heal your fuzzy.
Managing the signs and preventing future damage is your number-one prior-
ity. Unfortunately, too many ferrets are diagnosed with eosinophilic gastro-
enteritis when tissue damage is already profound. In these cases, prognosis
is guarded to poor.
250
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Treatment
Because the exact cause of eosinophilic gastroenteritis remains unknown, we
have no cure for the condition. Treatment is geared toward managing the cur-
rent signs and preventing further damage to the tissues. A maintenance dose
of a corticosteroid, such as prednisone, may be a lifelong necessity to pre-
vent a relapse and further damage. Corticosteroids suppress inflammation and
prevent large groups of eosinophils from forming; they also prevent them
from breaking down as easily, thus blocking further tissue damage.
A diet change is a must for ferrets with eosinophilic gastroenteritis, because
it’s suspected that food allergens may be culprits in this disease. If your
ferret will eat mice or raw meat, a natural diet is the best choice in my book.
(Chapter 8 has the full scoop on dietary options and changing your fuzzy’s
diet.) If not, you can start off by feeding your fuzzy turkey baby food in the
beginning and graduate to Hills z/d diet, which you can get from your vet.
Some vets even go so far as to say that the switch to a “hypoallergenic” diet
can successfully wean a ferret off of corticosteroids. Vets recommend a food
without any grains, such as Wysong’s Archetype freeze-dried diet. 
Megaesophagus
Megaesophagus is a relatively uncommon disease in ferrets. It’s the result 
of the absence of or the decrease in the ability of the esophageal muscles
(located in the throat and torso) to move food into the stomach. This break-
down in the muscles’ ability can be a problem all its own, often with unknown
causes, or it can be the result of an obstruction or damage to the nerves sup-
plying the esophageal muscles. 
The result of this loss of motility is that the esophagus swells as it fills with
food and/or liquid. Some of the food may flow back up and out of the mouth,
mimicking vomiting; some food may enter the ferret’s stomach, making a
sound much like water going down a drain. It isn’t unusual to hear gurgling or
notice that your ferret’s breathing is impaired. Aspiration pneumonia, the
result of inhaling food, also is a dangerous problem that these little ones face.
Your vet can make a diagnosis by using a barium swallow and X-ray, an
endoscopy, a fluoroscopy, or clinical observation. There is no cure for this
disease. The prognosis is guarded and depends a great deal on controlling
the signs and meeting the nutritional needs of the ferret. You need to show a
lot of care and dedication, because significant weight loss and dehydration
are common with megaesophagus. 
Your vet will use many different meds when dealing with megaesophagus,
depending on which signs you’re treating. You’ll probably have to hand feed
your ferret small, liquid meals three to five times a day for the remainder
251
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

of your ferret’s life. In the beginning, however, your ferret needs five to six
meals a day to get her back on her feet. You can use the Ferret Feeding
Formula (FFF), which I describe in Chapter 13. You want to start off with a
soupy mixture and feed 10 to 15 CCs per feeding, using a syringe! 
Although a soupy mixture is needed, it can increase the danger of aspiration.
You need to take great care during feeding. Keep your ferret’s head in an ele-
vated position and in line with its neck. Use a syringe to gently feed the soupy
mix to the ferret. A little choking is common. If the choking continues or
regurgitation occurs, allow your ferret to bring her head down to assist in
bringing the food back up. Let her rest 20 to 30 minutes before trying to feed
her again.
Some people suggest that you massage your ferret’s throat and chest to stim-
ulate swallowing. However, this practice can lead to regurgitation and aspira-
tion. Holding your ferret in the upright position with her head at a 45-degree
angle to the floor during feeding, and for 15 minutes or so after feeding, will
help gravity take over and facilitate the flow of food into the stomach.
Never use a water bowl for a ferret with megaesophagus, because her head
position with the bowl can cause choking. You need to hang a water bottle
high in her cage so that she has to stretch her neck up to reach for the water.
This will minimize the risk of choking.
Dental Problems
Many things can go wrong with an animal’s teeth. No toothy critter can hide
from this fact — not even ferrets. Some fuzzy dental problems probably are
genetic. Others can result from overuse and misuse of the chompers. Diet
and physical health also may play a major role in the destruction of a ferret’s
teeth. Do your part and make sure your ferret gets a dental checkup during
her routine exams at the vet’s office (see Figure 16-1). The following sections
look at some problems that can occur in your fuzzy’s mouth.
Faulty teeth
If you spend enough time with your fuzzy, you’ll see her rough and tumble
pretty hard with other fuzzies and her imaginary fuzzmates. She’ll fall and
crash into things. When she’s cage crazy, she may gnaw frantically at the
cage bars until someone rescues her. Plus, most ferrets are fed a hard kibble
diet, too (see Chapter 8). Because of these things, fuzzy teeth endure a lot of
wear and tear and abuse. For other fuzzies, teeth issues may be something
they were born with. The following sections look at wear and tear and born
problems.
252
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

To help you get through the dental reading and your life as a fuzzy owner,
here are a few terms that you need to be familiar with: 
 Plaque is a clear “biofilm” that’s made up of cellular debris, oral secre-
tions, plenty of bacteria, and some white blood cells. It adheres to the
teeth rather quickly and stays there until it’s removed. 
 Tartar and dental calculus are interchangeable words and result when
minerals are added to the plaque, causing the plaque to harden. All
tartar comes from plaque, but not all plaque mineralizes into tartar.
Tartar is a hard material that starts to build up on the teeth at the gum
line. It also adheres to the teeth and stays there until removal. 
 In the presence of plaque or plaque and tartar, gingivitis can occur. This is
an infection of the gums, or gingiva, caused by bacteria — usually those
found in the plaque biofilm. Gingivitis is marked by red, inflamed gums. 
 Periodontal disease often is next to come and is marked by recession of
the gum lines and actual bone loss. This is the stage where teeth lose
their support, become loose, and fall out. Damage from periodontal dis-
ease is permanent, so you need to provide care to prevent the condition.
(For more on this condition, see the following section.)
Wear and tear
Chipped, broken, and worn teeth aren’t necessarily things to gnash your teeth
over, unless you notice an obvious problem. But always let an experienced
vet make that decision for you if you have any doubt. A vet can smooth out a
chipped tooth if the surface is rough and irritating the inside of your ferret’s
lip. Breaks can be a little more serious. Exposed tooth pulp is painful and can
lead to infections. Usually, a root canal or complete removal is warranted.
A chipped tooth may hide a more serious problem, such as a hidden crack
leading into the pulp chamber of the tooth. The crack can result in a tooth
infection that can spread to other teeth. Even worse, the infection can spread
into the body and various vital organs such as the heart, kidneys, and liver.
All chipped teeth should be checked by a vet; you can probably wait until her
yearly physical, as long as you see no changes (such as discoloration, smell,
or drainage). Note: All chipped teeth are at risk of future fractures and need
to be watched.
Worn teeth are facts of life and will worsen as your ferret ages. Chewing hard
kibble into manageable sizes for swallowing may be more difficult, so older
fuzzies with worn teeth may need a softer diet (see Chapter 8 for more on
switching a ferret’s diet). 
Growing issues
Your ferret may end up looking more like a Bulldog than a fuzzy weasel. Some
poor furkids have teeth that protrude outward — usually, the canines are the
253
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

culprits. Because these teeth prevent the lip flap from resting against the
gums, the ferret’s gums may become dry. And the inside of the lip gets irri-
tated from the constant rubbing of the teeth. I’ve only had this situation
happen to one ferret, and the offending teeth were the two lower canines. The
problem was fixed by surgically clipping the teeth as far down as necessary
and filling them with a safe, hardening substance (acrylic is commonly used). 
If a ferret’s tooth is severely deformed, completely removing it may be neces-
sary. However, in small animals like ferrets, each tooth is an important part of
the strength of the jawbone. Pulling teeth can compromise the jaw by remov-
ing a part of the load-bearing strength, along with the subsequent loss of
bone that naturally occurs after the loss of a tooth. Therefore, this should be
a last resort.
Some furkids actually grow extra baby teeth. Albino kids are notorious for
this condition. Usually, all baby teeth are pushed right out when the adult
teeth come in. Other times, they linger for several days before finally being
squeezed out. If you notice a baby tooth that overstays its welcome, you
probably should have your vet uproot it to prevent problems down the road.
Note: Some adult ferrets have an extra incisor tooth (called a supernumery
tooth); this condition is harmless.
Says ferret expert Bob Church: “About 5 percent (2 to 9 percent) of ferrets
have an extra incisor tooth, and maybe 1 out of 100 of those have two extra
teeth. A fewer number of ferrets don’t grow all their teeth — usually a front
premolar or the bottom tiny mandibular molar. On rare occasions, a ferret
will have a tiny extra molar in the roof of her mouth. All these conditions are
benign.”
The dreaded dental disease
Gum disease, or periodontal disease, occurs with great frequency in ferrets —
especially ones that are over 5 years old. Come to think of it, it happens in
humans even more frequently. Humans are poor tooth brushers; and if we
can’t take care of our own teeth, we probably won’t spend a lot of time on our
pets’ teeth.
The main cause of periodontal disease is the lack of a natural diet (see
Chapter 8). Hair, bone, and other particles from a natural diet are extremely
effective at massaging the gums and wiping away plaque and tartar. Other
diseases, such as lymphoma, also can play a role in periodontal disease.
Experts agree that you can greatly reduce the severity of the disease with
daily tooth brushing and with more extensive cleanings performed by an
experienced vet, as often as needed. 
254
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Unqualified people shouldn’t scrape a ferret’s teeth because they can cause
scratches on the teeth that make tartar worse. Vets scrape the teeth free of
the tartar and then polish them, making the scratches less of a problem.
The signs of periodontal disease include
 Loose teeth
 Discolored teeth
 Stinky breath
 Red, inflamed, or receding gums
 Drooling
 Mouth ulcers
 Difficulty eating
 Tartar and plaque buildup
 Refusal to floss (okay, just kidding)
At the very least, you should add dental checkups to your weekly or monthly
grooming habits. In addition to checking for lumps, bumps, bruises, and
other abnormalities, stick your head in your fuzzy’s mouth and look for
dental problems. For more on general care and grooming habits, head to
Chapter 9.
Gum disease and ulcers of the mouth are serious problems by themselves.
But did you know they can also be caused by renal disease, especially in fer-
rets five years and older? Renal disease can be diagnosed with blood tests
and a urinalysis.
255
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses
Dealing with dental dominoes
Friend and ferret expert Bob Church has this to
say about dental issues: “All visible dental
damage is considered more or less permanent
because the ability of the tooth to repair enamel
is extremely limited. Thus, dental damage is
accumulative over time. Every tooth injury adds
to the last one and helps set up the next one. For
example, eating kibble wears flat spots on the
tooth, which increases the risk of platform frac-
tures (slab fractures) and changes the dental
tartar accumulation patterns — both of which
help increase gingivitis and periodontal disease,
which leads to infections and major tooth loss.
I call the disease risk factors ‘Dental Dominos.’”

In addition to the lack of proper texture in a traditional diet, which provides
gentle abrasiveness, eating fine particles of carbohydrates and changes in the
oral pH contribute to periodontal disease. My answer to combating periodon-
tal disease is to opt for the evolutionary or alternative diet, which offers vari-
ous food items with varying degrees of texture. (See Chapter 8 for details
about the diet.)
Heart Disease
Sadly, heart disease is a rather common problem in middle-aged and older
ferrets. The most common type of heart disease seen in ferrets is dilated car-
diomyopathy. We focus on these topics in the sections that follow, explaining
the signs, diagnosis, and treatment phases of the diseases (and prevention
when applicable). (Ferrets also can also suffer from hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy and from heart valve disease.)
The ultimate means of establishing a diagnosis of heart disease is an ultra-
sound of the heart. An ultrasound is the only way to determine the actual
cause of the heart problems: 
 If the heart walls are stretched and thin, a doctor can diagnose dilated
cardiomyopathy.
 If the heart walls are much thicker and bigger than normal, the doctor
can diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
 If the heart valves are thicker than normal and not working well, the
doctor can diagnose valvular heart disease.
 If heartworms are seen in the heart, the doctor can diagnose heartworm
disease. 
Because the treatment for these four problems is different, a cardiac ultra-
sound is necessary to make the correct diagnosis and to select the correct
treatment plan for your fuzzy with heart disease.
Dilated cardiomyopathy
Dilated cardiomyopathy is most common in ferrets over the age of 3. It’s a
form of heart disease that causes damage to the heart muscle. Eventually,
during the course of the disease, the heart stretches, enlarges, and weakens.
Some of the heart muscle is replaced by scar tissue, making it impossible for
the heart to contract normally. Inevitably, the blood flowing out of the heart
decreases, and the heart becomes less efficient.
256
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

The exact cause of dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown at this time. Possible
causes include viral infections and nutritional problems, such as deficiencies
of taurine, l-carnitine, l-arginine, or perhaps even a deficiency of Coenzyme
Q10 in the diet. The relationship of a taurine deficiency causing dilated car-
diomyopathy has already been proven in cats. Unlike cats, however, ferrets
don’t improve when extra taurine is added to their diets.
How long your big-hearted fuzzy will live with dilated cardiomyopathy really
depends on how fast her heart is deteriorating. If your ferret is diagnosed
early, and you and your vet manage the signs properly, she may live for 2 or 3
more years.
Signs
Following are the signs of the dilated cardiomyopathy form of heart disease:
 Labored breathing
 Coughing
 Pale or bluish gum coloring
 Decreased or no appetite
 Heart murmur
 Lethargy
 Frequent rests during play
 Muffled heart sounds
 Hypothermia (low body temperature)
 Fluid buildup in the chest and abdominal areas
Ferrets with cardiomyopathy often have enlarged livers or spleens, as well.
Frequently, a suffering fuzzy has a swollen belly. In this case, she probably
has congestive heart failure, and the swollen belly results from a buildup of
fluid in the abdomen. The ferret likely also has fluid accumulating in her
chest and lungs.
Diagnosis
Heart disease usually begins long before the diagnosis is made; however, a
diagnosis also can be made before the onset of the signs. X-rays can be taken
to look at the size and shape of the heart. Dilated cardiomyopathy heart
disease causes the heart to be bigger and rounder than normal. An EKG can
check for abnormal rhythms and conduction disturbances. And, of course,
the best diagnosis method is an ultrasound, which I discuss earlier in this
section.
257
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

Treatment
Dilated cardiomyopathy generally is irreversible and has no cure. Treatment
is designed to control the disease and slow down its progression. You can
manage dilated cardiomyopathy with medication. The medications that vets
commonly prescribe are 
 An ACE inhibitor — such as benazepril or enalapril
 A diuretic — such as furosemide
 A muscle contraction strengthener — such as digoxin or pimobendan
Only your vet and/or vet cardiologist can determine which medications and
what dosages should work for your ferret.
Heartworms
Heartworm disease is a parasitic roundworm (Dirofilaria immitis) infestation
that attacks the heart. Where many mosquitoes buzz around, vets and ferret
owners will see plenty of cases of heartworm. Ferrets are just as susceptible
to this deadly disease as cats and dogs. In fact, many carnivores are. Even if
your ferret doesn’t go outside, mosquitoes can come inside. 
Infected mosquitoes inject the larva into the ferret’s bloodstream with a
single piercing bite. The deadly parasite then develops and migrates to the
fuzzy’s heart, where the adult worms wreak cardiac havoc. It only takes a
single worm to produce devastating results.
Signs
Signs of heartworm disease include the following:
 Coughing or hacking
 Lethargy
 Fluid buildup in the chest and abdomen
 Labored breathing
 Pale lips, gums, and tongue
 Hypothermia (low body temperature)
 Heart murmur
 Muffled heart sounds
 Green color to the urine
258
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Prevention
The best course of action against heartworm is prevention. Fortunately, you
can acquire several effective options to prevent your ferret from getting
heartworm:
 Heartgard: You can use Heartgard for cats or 1⁄4 of the Heartgard for
small dogs once a month. Be aware: Most fuzzies don’t like the stuff!
Merial, the maker of Heartgard, advises against splitting the pills or
chewables. The company states that the effective ingredient (iver-
mectin) isn’t evenly distributed throughout the pills or chewables, so
you don’t know for sure if your fuzzy is really getting an effective dose.
Ferrets can handle large dosages of ivermectin. A whole feline chewable
Heartgard has less ivermectin in it than a dose a fuzzy would receive for
treatment of ear mites.
 Ivermectin: Some vets prefer giving ferrets liquid ivermectin orally (or
through injection) on a monthly basis.
 Interceptor: These tablets are small and easy to crush, and you can mix
them into some baby food or Ferretone. Interceptor tablets need to be
given once a month.
 Revolution: This medicine for cats is a liquid that you apply directly
to the skin on the neck or above the shoulders (you do this monthly).
In addition to heartworm prevention, Revolution kills fleas, ticks, and
ear mites. 
Most vets prescribe the kitten dose of Revolution for a ferret when pro-
tecting her from fleas and ticks. This makes sense considering how little
ferrets weigh! Some vet cardiologists, though, have suggested that this
dose isn’t strong enough to protect a ferret against heartworms; they
say that the cat dose is the effective dose against heartworms. This may
seem quite high, because cats can weigh so much more than ferrets, and
you don’t want to risk the life of your beloved pet! Therefore, always dis-
cuss this subject with your vet to make sure your ferret is kept healthy
and adequately protected.
 Advantage Multi: This product is new to the U.S. market. The two main
ingredients are imidacloprid (Advantage) and moxidectin. Like Revolution,
it’s a monthly topical applied directly to the skin on the neck or above
the shoulders. In addition to heartworm prevention, Advantage Multi
kills fleas, ear mites, and intestinal worms. The kitten size (2 to 5
pounds) is the size recommended for ferret use.
Before beginning a heartworm preventative, your ferret should test negative
for heartworms, if possible. Fuzzies can be tested with the same in-clinic test
that dogs get. Another detection method is a cardiac ultrasound, but it takes
an experienced ultrasounder to visualize the heartworms in the ferret’s heart.
259
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

None of these preventatives are approved for use in ferrets or have been
tested in ferrets, so are used at the owner’s risk. Manufacturers of these 
medications will not help out if there’s a reaction or problem, such as not
protecting the ferret against heartworms, because the use in ferrets is what’s
considered “off” label. They are used extensively by ferret owners, however.
Treatment
Infected ferrets usually die without treatment. Heartworm treatment, how-
ever, is relatively new in ferrets. Some vets report a 60- to 75-percent survival
rate when using Immiticide to treat heartworms. Prednisone is often used
during and after the treatment period. The safer option is to treat more 
conservatively with ivermectin, furosemide, and prednisone. High doses of
ivermectin slowly kills the adult heartworms. Furosemide treats the fluid
retention, and prednisone prevents dangerous blood clots from forming as
the heartworms die. (Occasionally diltiazem will also be used to treat the
right-sided congestive heart failure that the heartworms can cause.) 
Vets highly recommend cage rest during heartworm treatment. As you can
see, prevention is much better and safer than treatment! 
What extra care you can give your ferret
Along with extra rest, ferrets with heart disease should embark on a gentle
exercise routine, with plenty of close supervision during playtime. Over-
stimulation may worsen the condition. Of course, common sense also dic-
tates that frightening or startling these little heart breakers isn’t a good idea.
No barking dogs, firecrackers, or tuba playing, please. Ferrets with heart dis-
ease benefit from a low-sodium diet. Use only treats and baby food (such as
turkey and turkey gravy) with a low salt content. 
Influenza (The “Flu”)
Don’t sneeze on your fuzzy, and don’t let her sneeze on you, either! Your
ferret is highly susceptible to human influenza A; you can pass it back and
forth to each other if you’re not careful. Influenza is the most common respi-
ratory infection in ferrets. In healthy ferrets, recovery takes about five days.
In weak or old ferrets, the sickness can be a little more serious, lasting sev-
eral weeks.

Disseminated Idiopathic Myofasciitis
Katrina D. Ramsell, PhD, DVM
Disseminated idiopathic myofasciitis (DIM), also
known as “Polymyositis,” is a relatively new dis-
ease in domestic ferrets. The earliest docu-
mented case is from 1999, and the disease was
first described in 2003. DIM causes a severe
inflammatory condition that primarily affects a
ferret’s muscles (myositis). The disease gener-
ally affects ferrets less than two years of age
and is suspected when a ferret exhibits partic-
ular clinical signs and has blood values consis-
tent with the disease. Muscle biopsies are
currently the only way of confirming the disease
in a living ferret. Until 2006, DIM was considered
a fatal disease. There are now some confirmed
cases and several suspected cases that have
responded favorably to the current treatment
protocol and are doing well.
Initial signs of DIM usually come on relatively
quickly and commonly include: 
 A severe, persistent, fluctuating fever (often
104-108(°F)
 Severe lethargy and weakness
 Dehydration
 Enlarged lymph nodes or masses under the
skin
 Abnormal stools
 Decreased appetite
Other signs that may occur with DIM include:
 Sensitivity/pain when touched, especially in
the hind end
 Increased heart and respiratory rates
 Clear discharge from the nose and some-
times eyes
 Tiny orange dots on the skin
 Pale gums
Ferrets with DIM often have a dramatic
increase in their white blood cell count, with
most of these cells being neutrophils (cells
involved with inflammation and infection). DIM
ferrets are also commonly anemic (too few red
blood cells), and chemistry results often show a
decrease in the blood protein albumin and an
increase in blood glucose. 
Despite many diagnostic tests, a cause for DIM
still has not been identified. It does not appear
to be a contagious disease, and it has not been
associated with any particular breeders, foods,
or environmental agents. DIM is likely an
immune-mediated disease, and vaccines are
currently being investigated as a potential
cause for this condition. There is no apparent
link between this disease and ferret vaccines
that are currently available on the market. 
Although DIM was considered a fatal disease
for three years, a few ferrets confirmed to have
DIM and several ferrets suspected to have the
disease have responded well to the current
treatment protocol. All confirmed, untreated
cases have died. If you suspect your ferret has
DIM you should contact a ferret knowledgeable
veterinarian immediately. Contact information
for consultation on DIM and more complete
information on the disease is available through
the American Ferret Association Web site at:
www.ferret.org. 

Here are the signs that your ferret has influenza (ones we all, unfortunately,
know so well):
 Sneezing and coughing
 Runny nose and eyes
 Fever over 104° Fahrenheit
 Lethargy
 Wheezing
 Diarrhea
 Face rubbing
 Loss of appetite
Unfortunately, the signs are so general and so common to other conditions
that it can be difficult to identify the flu. 
A little tender, loving care usually is all it takes to get your ferret through.
However, antibiotics, fluids, and tummy-coaters may be necessary to combat
severe bouts of the flu. Be sure to consult your vet. For severe sneezing,
some vets may recommend an antihistamine. Be sure to wash your hands fre-
quently after and in between handling your sicky. Your ferret won’t think
twice about sharing her miserable illness with you or other ferrets.
Tylenol (acetaminophen) is extremely toxic to ferrets, even in very low doses.
The liver metabolizes the medicine, which will send your ferret reeling into
liver failure quickly before killing him. Many over-the-counter medicines con-
tain acetaminophen. It’s important that you don’t use any over-the-counter
products without your vet’s guidance and approval. You can prevent many
fatal mistakes.
If the signs persist for longer than a week, or your fuzzy shows signs of refusing
to eat at all, you may not be dealing with the flu. Get to a vet immediately. A
ferret with the flu is crabby and tired, but she isn’t knocked completely on her
butt. Also, look for abnormal discharge from her nose. A flu discharge is clear. 
Bacterial pneumonia can bubble up for several reasons — often due to a flu
gone from bad to worse. In addition to having flu-like signs, pneumonia
causes open-mouthed breathing or labored breathing along with severe,
sometimes discolored, nasal goo. Bacterial pneumonia can kill your fuzzy
quickly. The treatment depends on the type of bacteria producing the pneu-
monia. To make the diagnosis and prescribe the defense, your vet can per-
form a tracheal wash by introducing a small amount of saline into the trachea
and then sucking it back up to perform a culture. This can be safely done
under a general anesthetic and oxygen. Depending on the type of bacteria
present, your vet may prescribe a dosage of penicillin, sulfadiazine, or
trimethoprim.
262
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Ferrets, contrary to popular belief, don’t catch the common cold, which is
caused by a rhinovirus. However, ferrets can catch bacterial sinus infections,
influenza A, and upper-respiratory infections, all of which can mimic cold-like
signs.
Urinary Tract Problems
Several urinary tract problems can pop up in carpet sharks. Many of the
problems have similar signs, so a trip to the veterinarian is advisable upon
the outset of signs — especially when you consider that urinary tract infec-
tions can become serious enough to cause kidney damage and even death.
You need to have a correct diagnosis made and begin treatment as soon as
possible.
Bladder or urinary tract infections
Bladder or urinary tract infections are caused most often by that irritating 
resident bacteria E. coli (found in poop, so keep that litter box clean).
Staphylococcus is another bacterium that can be the evildoer. Although both
males and females are susceptible to this type of infection, it seems more
common in females in heat and females with adrenal disease (see Chapter 16).
Signs of a bladder or urinary tract infection include
 Straining to urinate
 Painful urination
 Frequent piddles
 Discolored or smelly urine
If you notice any of these signs, take your critter to the vet immediately.
Bladder infections can travel to the kidneys and cause major damage and
death. By the time a full-blown kidney infection develops, your fuzzy may be
so gravely ill that treatment can prove futile, so correct and early diagnosis is
imperative.
Most experts agree that treatment with the proper antibiotics should con-
tinue for a minimum of two weeks; some opt for a three-week course of treat-
ment. Stopping the medication too soon may cause the infection to flare up
again. And the bug may be even stronger and more resistant to medications
the next time around.
263
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

Prostate problems
Although male ferrets can get urinary tract infections — they may exhibit
similar signs — your vet should first rule out a prostate problem, such as
inflammation, cysts, tumors, or abscesses. Prostate woes may be diagnosed
just by feeling for an enlargement. You may get to see a little pus ooze out of
the fuzzy when his infected prostate is squeezed. Eeeeew! Because this male
condition always is a result of adrenal disease (see Chapter 16), it may go
away when you treat that condition. 
Stones and blockages
Bladder stones aren’t that common in fuzzies, and the cause still isn’t fully
understood. Some experts speculate that a poor diet high in ash or plant-
based protein plays a major role. Other possible causes include bacterial or
viral infections and even genetic links. Whatever the cause, a bladder stone is
a painful condition. The signs are similar to those of a urinary tract infection.
Other signs may include bloody or gritty urine (the grit or sand actually is
mineral deposits).
If the stones in your fuzzy’s system get big enough or collect in the same
area, blockages can occur. Your fuzzy will no longer leave piddle puddles at
this point. This situation is painful and deadly and requires immediate atten-
tion and treatment.
Because stones and blockages mimic infections, diagnosis can be difficult.
Often, your vet can feel the large, urine-filled bladder or even the stones them-
selves. Use of X-rays has been successful in identifying stones in the bladder.
Treatment depends on the severity of the situation. It may be as simple as a
change in diet (see Chapter 8), or it may require more drastic measures —
such as surgery. A vet will put your ferret on a regimen of antibiotics to help
combat the problem.
Eye Problems
I believe that most every living thing with eyeballs is prone to cataracts and
other afflictions of the eye. Naturally, ferrets fall into the group of susceptible
animals. I have several fuzzies with cataracts, which are quite common. Some
of these furballs are completely blind; others have partial vision. Very often,
however, most eye problems in ferrets can be corrected surgically or med-
ically. Don’t worry if your ferret’s eyes aren’t fixable; a blind ferret or one with
limited vision can find trouble as well as or better than a carpet shark with
perfect vision.
264
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

What sort of things cause interference with sight in the ferret? To name just 
a few:
 Retinal Disease
 Disease of the lens (cataracts or luxated (twisted) lens)
 Disease of the optic nerve 
 Central nervous system problems that affect the vision center (stroke,
head trauma)
 Trauma to the eye globe causing rupture or puncture
 Corneal Disease (scarring from ulcers or trauma)
Following are sure-fire signs of eye problems: 
 Your ferret seems more cautious about moving around.
 She startles and backs off or snaps at you when you reach in to grab her.
 She walks into things.
 She avoids open spaces and runs along walls or large objects.
 Cataracts are visibly present in her eyes.
 She places a call to your health-insurance carrier to see if laser surgery
is covered.
If you’re not sure if your ferret is blind, you can do the finger test. All my
sighted ferrets rapidly chase, follow, or watch my finger as I move it from side
to side. My blind guys just pop up their heads and listen to figure out what
everyone else is doing. I love these guys. They’re so cute!
265
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses
Living with cataracts
Most of us know people who’ve had cataracts
removed from their eyes so that they could see
better. Ferrets are prone to this eye disorder,
and they can have their cataracts removed just
like we can. The condition is easy to spot,
because the ferret’s eye becomes opaque or
filmy behind the pupil. Cataracts eventually
cause blindness because they prevent light
from reaching the retina.
If your ferret has a cataract and is under 1 year
old, the problem probably is genetic (that is, the
result of poor breeding). Some cataracts can be
caused by an injury (even while a furkid is inside
her mom), a disease, or even an improper diet.
Cataracts also may be a developing sign of old
age. Although your ferret may be treated for
cataracts, blind ferrets adapt very well, as I
explain in the “Eye Problems” section.

Blind ferrets adapt and function very well. However, you must take special
precautions when dealing with a blind ferret. For example, you don’t want to
sneak up on her or startle her. You may need to take extra care when ferret-
proofing your home to keep her away from falling dangers such as furniture or
stairs. You can use scent mapping to help her learn her way around. You have
many ways to improve your relationship with your visually impaired ferret!

Aleutian Disease Virus (ADV)
Aleutian Disease (AD) is a contagious and potentially fatal ferret disease
caused by a parvovirus. No vaccine is currently available for ferrets. Named
after the Aleutian mink, which is highly susceptible to infection with this dis-
ease, ADV was first diagnosed on a mink ranch in the 1940s and then in fer-
rets in the 1960s. The biggest problem with this virus for the ferret isn’t the
virus itself, but the ferret’s immune-system response to the invader.

Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 
What? Is your ferret deaf?
Having a deaf ferret isn’t the end of the world,
much like blindness can be overcome. Deaf-
ness is common and can be caused by many
things. Perhaps the most common cause is a
genetic defect. Breeders manipulate many
genes to achieve the pretty white markings on
ferrets, which can also be associated with deaf-
ness. Other causes of deafness include head
trauma, infections such as meningitis, seizures,
severe and ongoing ear-mite infestations, and
ear infections. Certain medications, such as
Gentamicin, Gentocin, and Streptomycin, also
have been proven to cause deafness in ferrets.
Not sure if your ferret is deaf? Want to find out
for sure? Do you want to know what type of
behaviors deaf ferrets exhibit, and what you can
expect in the future? How do you care for a deaf
ferret? What considerations must you make?
Well, there are several ways you can determine,
but first remember to test in your own home
with no distractions, no other ferrets, and no
use of vibrations. Do not use visual cues. Do not
use odors. It’s also important to wait until the
ferret has explored the room and is comfortable
with his surroundings.
 Use a squeaky toy, and when he isn’t look-
ing, squeak it to see if he responds.
 Same thing as above, but clap loudly or
slam a book shut.
 Put some pennies in a coffee tin and shake
it when the ferret turns his back to you.
I have oversimplified the subject of deafness in
this brief overview. I can point you to easy
explanations for all your questions! You can find
an extraordinary amount of information on deaf
ferrets on my friend Wolfy’s Web site: www.
wolfysluv.com/deaf.html. I encour-
age you to visit this site to educate yourself on
the topic of deafness.

When a virus enters the body, the body usually forms antibodies. These anti-
bodies attach to the virus to help the body’s immune system identify the
virus as a foreign invader, thus triggering a defensive response to destroy it.
In the case of ADV, a large complex of substances, not just the antibodies,
bind with the viral particles and form antibody or immune complexes. These
large complexes circulate throughout the body until they’re deposited into
the tissues of various organs; here, due to their size, the complexes cause
inflammation. In small amounts, the complexes won’t cause outward signs of
disease; however, if the body deposits enough of these complexes into one
area, the clinical disease may result.
Although transmission of ADV can occur through the air, typical transmission
occurs through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected ferret, or
from contaminated cages, supplies, or humans. Practicing good husbandry
and sanitation is the best way to prevent the spread of ADV. Note: The ADV
can remain in a ferret-free home for up to two years.
Aleutian Disease Virus (ADV) is the actual organism that causes the disease
and Aleutian Disease (AD) is the disease caused by the virus. ADV is not
interchangeable with AD.  
Doctors are still researching AD, and vets don’t yet agree on how easily or
quickly it can be passed. What they do agree on is that not all ADV-positive
ferrets will develop the clinical signs of the disease. Some may never show
signs at all. The bad news is that these seemingly healthy animals may be
able to shed the virus, or pass it to other ferrets, at any time. According to
Susan Brown, DVM, co-author of Essentials of Ferrets: A Guide for Practitioners,
“We know very little about this ‘carrier state,’ including how often or under
what conditions the virus is shed by the carrier, how long the infection can
last, and whether the ferret can ever completely rid its body of the virus.”
Clinical signs
Yes, many ADV-positive ferrets may never show clinical signs; and no one can
predict if or when the ADV-positive ferret will show signs. It can be months or
even years, if ever. The signs of AD are variable and depend largely on what
organs are affected and what, if any, secondary infections have arisen as a
result. The following list presents the possibilities; upon seeing a sign, head
to your vet on the double:
 Weight loss
 Bloody (black, tarry) stools
 Hind-end weakness

Diagnosis and prognosis
Signs of AD vary by type and severity, and they can’t be used as the sole diag-
nostic tool of the disease. Unfortunately, many other ferret illnesses and dis-
eases have the same or similar manifestations as AD. The vet will use the
ferret’s history, along with the clinical signs, to rule out the most likely non-
AD causes of your ferret’s illness. 
Doctors may run a specific test on either blood or saliva to confirm or rule out
ADV, provided by Avecon Diagnostics, called the ELISA test. Unfortunately, as
of press time, the accuracy of this test hasn’t been determined. Additionally, a
positive result doesn’t necessarily mean that ADV is what’s causing the clini-
cal signs you see; it only means that the virus likely is present. Perhaps the
most definitive diagnosis comes from taking biopsies of multiple organs.
Science currently has no cure for AD and no way to predict how long a ferret
that exhibits clinical AD-related signs will live. It all depends on the severity
of the damage to the organs. Unfortunately, most active cases of AD aren’t
diagnosed until the later stages of the disease, thus shortening the ferrets’
lives. Based on the clinical signs present, the positive presence of ADV and
its infectious nature, and the likely prognosis, you and your vet must discuss
the best plan of action for your ferret.
Treatment
You and your vet can manage the clinical signs to a degree with supportive
care. The care will vary according to what signs are present and the degree in
which they’re manifested. Your ferret may require assisted feedings and addi-
tional fluids to help keep her hydrated. Your vet also may prescribe anti-
inflammatory drugs and other medications to treat the clinical signs. 
You need to put AD into perspective and not panic. AD has been around for
decades and has thus far been far less of a serious issue than problems such
as cancer, ulcers, intestinal blockages, and Helicobacter. You should always
practice good husbandry procedures to prevent the spread of any disease
from ferret to ferret, especially if you own multiple fuzzies or come into con-
tact with fuzzy strangers.

Canine Distemper
Canine distemper is an unforgiving and miserable disease that’s 99.9 percent
fatal. In extremely rare instances, ferrets have survived, but all survivors
have suffered neurological impairments. Because no treatment is available,
prevention is critical. You can do your part to prevent the disease by vacci-
nating your fuzzy. 
The canine distemper virus is extremely contagious and can be transmitted
to your fuzzy via other infected animals. If you think your fuzzy is safe from
canine distemper because she never leaves the house, you’re dead wrong.
You can carry this virus into your household on your shoes and clothing. The
distemper virus also can live a long time outside of the victim’s body. So be
careful and do the right thing: Vaccinate your fuzzy. Note: Humans can’t catch
this disease from the poor victims.
The incubation period (the time it takes from the day of infection to the onset
of signs) in your ferret may be as little as 7 days or as long as 21 days. When
the signs appear, death usually occurs quickly, because the virus attacks
many organs at once. On rare occasions, a fuzzy may suffer a longer, more
miserable death. Because the prognosis is hopeless and the signs are unbear-
ably miserable, if your vet makes a positive diagnosis, he should humanely
euthanize your ferret as soon as possible. The extremely rare survivor will
just suffer severe neurological damage and her quality of life will be poor.
Clinical signs of distemper include
 Eye infection/discharge
 Severe lethargy
 Loss of appetite
 Rash on chin, lips, and nose
 Rash on belly and heinie
 Hardened/thick paw pads
 Diarrhea
 Vomiting
 Seizures
 Coma
Pet owners who decide against vaccinating for distemper run the risk of not
only a single ferret becoming infected with distemper, but also the entire
group. A single ferret can come into contact with the virus — perhaps from
the owner’s shoe or during a vet checkup where an infected dog was in the
office — become ill, and infect all the ferrets in the household before the
owner realizes what’s going on.

Enlarged Spleen (Splenomegaly)
The spleen (in ferrets and in other animals and humans) has several func-
tions: For example,
 It serves as a blood purifier, filtering out bacteria and damaged cells.
 It provides the perfect environment for the cells of the immune system to
learn how to counterattack an invasion of possible marauding organisms. 
 It stores iron from old red blood cells, which is used to make new red
blood cells. In ferrets and many other species, the spleen is an addi-
tional site for red and white blood cell production.
 In some species, the spleen stores blood and releases it in times of need. 
An enlarged spleen, or splenomegaly, is extremely prevalent in fuzzies, and no
one really knows why. This problem often appears by itself, with no other
underlying diseases. The ferret’s spleen normally gets larger with age, but
sometimes this growth is accelerated. One common thought is that the use of
certain anesthetics rapidly causes this condition. The enlargement in this
case is temporary only while the animal is under the effects of the anesthetic.
Then the spleen goes back to normal. The spleen is very elastic, and may
enlarge and go back to normal on its own as well when responding to the
body’s needs for more cells
Diagnosing an enlarged spleen is relatively easy. Most experienced vets
should be able to feel the enlarged organ by simply squishing around the
ferret’s abdomen. And an X-ray often confirms the size and condition of the
organ. Care should be taken not to apply enough pressure to rupture a
severely bulging spleen.
The shared expert opinion regarding treatment is to leave the spleen in if it
isn’t causing discomfort or other problems. In other words, “If it ain’t broke,
don’t fix it.” Fuzzies generally can live long, healthy lives with big spleens.
Removing a spleen unnecessarily can put your baby in more jeopardy. On the
other hand, if the oversized spleen is causing discomfort, lethargy, or loss 
of appetite, removal of the organ is necessary. Surgery to remove the spleen
actually is straightforward, and the survival rate is extremely high — 
especially when no other illnesses are present. 
It’s always a good idea to have your vet send out a sample of the spleen to a
pathologist to determine the cause of the enlargement. Remember, illnesses or
diseases caught early have a better chance of being treated more effectively.
270
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Hairballs
Ferrets are prone to developing gastric hairballs, and hairballs can lead to
intestinal blockages. Unlike cats, ferrets won’t leave colorful wads of urped-
up fur on your newly shampooed carpet. Ferrets are capable of throwing up,
but usually the fur accumulates in the ferret’s body until it becomes a large
mass — a mass too big to go either up or down. Hairballs and other block-
ages (see the section “Intestinal and stomach blockages”) can cause ferrets
to become seriously ill — and they often cause death.
You should give your ferret a hairball preventative such as Laxatone,
Petromalt, or Laxaire on a regular basis to help clean out her system. I give
each of my ferrets 1⁄4 teaspoon of a hairball preventative a few times a week.
Most ferrets like the taste of the stuff, although some need to get used to it.
With more difficult types, you may need to insist that they take it — by
squeezing it directly into their mouths. You can find hairball remedies or 
preventives at many pet stores and certainly at the larger pet supply stores.
Some ferret shelters and veterinarians also carry these products. You
absolutely must have a tube of this type of product on hand at all times.
If you think your fuzzy has ingested something that can cause major internal
damage, increase the hairball remedy to 1⁄2 teaspoon twice a day to help pass
the object through. Monitor her health and behavior closely and get her to
the vet immediately if her health deteriorates. If you don’t have a yummy-
tasting hairball preventative on hand for some reason, a good substitute is
petroleum jelly (Vaseline). You may need to mix it with a little Ferretone or
another liquid treat to help the ferret swallow it.
Rabies
Although ferrets are highly unlikely to contract rabies, the possibility does
exist. Rabies, caused by a rhabdovirus, is passed through the saliva of an
infected animal, most frequently through a bite that penetrates the skin. After
entering the body, the deadly virus attaches to nerve bundles, reproduces,
and migrates to the victim’s brain. The virus then travels along nerve bundles
until it reaches the salivary glands, where the animal can then pass it to
another victim through a bite.
Many different strains of the rabies virus exist, including rodent, raccoon,
fox, and skunk strains. Studies suggest that fuzzies are most susceptible to
the raccoon strain, which they can pass on before death. 
271
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

Rabies can manifest itself in one of two ways: 
 Furious rabies: With furious rabies, the infected animal exhibits intense
aggression, biting, and foaming at the mouth.
 Dumb rabies: With dumb rabies, the animal becomes lethargic and
deathly ill, and wants little to do with people or other animals. Animals
with dumb rabies don’t attack and usually die quickly. Although ferret
infection is extremely rare, studies indicate that ferrets will likely exhibit
dumb rabies, with death occurring seven days (on average) after the
ferret has been infected.
The following signs also suggest that your ferret may have rabies (although
they can indicate a host of problems):
 Disorientation
 Loss of coordination
 Muscle spasms
 Difficulty breathing
 Drooling
 Nervousness
 Hind-leg weakness
 Passiveness
 Hind-end paralysis
Today, unlike many years ago, you have a choice on how much life “insur-
ance” you’re willing to buy for your lovable fuzzbutt, because you can give
her a rabies vaccine. Some people want to weigh the pros and cons of vacci-
nating (the only viable con being a history of life-threatening allergic reac-
tions), but the pros weigh heavily on the scale. Failure to vaccinate your
ferret can lead to a miserable disease and death. To the true fuzzy human, the
emotional cost of losing a ferret to a preventable disease is immeasurable.
Proof of vaccination also may calm the fears of people who get bitten or
scratched — and perhaps prevent confiscation of your pet (see Chapter 3). 
Ulcers
By the time you’re done reading about all that can go wrong with your fuzzy,
you may be suffering from an ulcer yourself! Ulcers are one of the most
common ferret diseases. An ulcer is an open sore, which can occur on the
272
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. For this section, I talk about ulcers of the
gastrointestinal tract. The causes of ulcers are just about the same for fuzzies
and humans:
 Stress, stress, and more stress: The stress can come from illness, dis-
ease, grief (loss of a cagemate), low-quality food, injury, or even anxiety
over the environment (overcrowding, abuse, small cage, poor hus-
bandry, no exercise, and so on). (For more on helping your fuzzy grieve,
check out Chapter 17.)
 Possible bacterial invasion: The bacteria H. mustelae’s presence may
trigger a progressive inflammatory reaction in a ferret’s stomach’s lining.
The reaction weakens the lining and predisposes it to further damage.
Ulcers, perhaps? No one knows for sure if bacteria can be directly linked
to ulcers, but it sure can cause some serious damage to the tummy.
 Ulcer-causing substances: These substances include alcohol, aspirin,
and certain medications.
 Hairballs or other stomach foreign bodies: Rubbing on the lining of the
stomach in the same area over and over can cause severe irritation.
Signs
The signs of an ulcer include the following:
 Lethargy
 Tender belly
 Face rubbing
 Black, tarry stools
 Teeth grinding
 Loss of appetite
 Vomiting (may be bloody)
 Weight loss
 Pale gums
 Bad breath
 Hunched posture (painful abdomen)
 More aggression (pain)
If you notice any of these signs, take your ferret to the vet for an exam and
diagnosis. 
273
Chapter 15: Handling Viruses, Infections, and Other Conditions and Illnesses

Diagnosis
Having an ulcer diagnosed as soon as possible is important, because it’s a
very painful condition that may lead to death. Besides being unable to ade-
quately digest their food, ulcer patients bleed internally from oozing blood
vessels. For some reason, ulcer signs often are misdiagnosed as another
intestinal or stomach problem. An effective diagnostic tool is a barium X-ray,
which shows any signs of burned-out bellies or intestine.
Treatment
Treatment of ulcers usually begins with antibiotic therapy, with medicines
such as Amoxicillin and Biaxin to combat H. mustelae. Some veterinarians
use Flagyl. To treat the ulcer itself, most vets use Carafate (which is most
effective when given 10 minutes prior to feeding; consult your vet). Your vet
may prescribe OTC acid relievers such as Pepcid AC or Tagamet to relieve
the burning and nausea that accompany ulcers. A bland diet is recommended
during treatment (see Chapter 8 for tips on changing diet).
Because a ferret’s body is always secreting stomach acid to help break down
food, treatment can be long and tedious. It can and usually will take over a
month for a ferret’s ulcer to heal, and you should be prepared to treat the
ulcer for a minimum of ten days after all signs have disappeared. Also, don’t
be surprised if your ferret gets another ulcer down the road. After she gets
one, she’ll be prone to getting more.
If you allow your ferret’s ulcer to progress without proper treatment, it may
become so deep that it hits a major blood vessel and causes the suffering
fuzzy to bleed to death internally. (The black, tarry stool associated with
ulcers, for example, actually is digested blood and a sign of bleeding in the
digestive tract.) If your ferret doesn’t bleed to death, anemia may result from
the constant rupturing of small blood vessels in the belly. Ulcers can also go
all the way through the lining of the stomach and perforate, leading to the
dumping of stomach contents into the abdomen and resulting in peritonitis
and death.

Finding and Treating the 
Big C and Other Lumps
In This Chapter
 Surveying the top three ferret cancers
 Identifying and removing skin tumors and chordomas
 Reviewing your treatment and manageability options
U
nfortunately, whether you own one ferret or ten, you’re likely to
encounter ferret cancer during your time as a ferret owner. The three
most prevalent cancer conditions are adrenal disease (which may or may not
be cancerous), insulinoma, and lymphosarcoma. Symptoms and treatments
vary, as well as prognoses.
As you’ll see in this chapter, the Big C diagnosis is rarely an immediate death
sentence. Many cases are treatable. Others are manageable, and your ferret
may live a few more quality years after the diagnosis, with or without ongoing
medical intervention. However, early detection and treatment are instrumen-
tal in adding quality months or even years to your fuzzy’s life, so you need to
watch for changes in your fuzzy’s appearance, habits, and behavior. A good
vet will trust your judgment that something isn’t quite right with your fuzzbutt
(see Chapter 12 for tips on finding a good vet). In this chapter, I discuss the
three main types of ferret cancer. I also discuss chordomas and skin tumors.
Adrenal Gland Disease
Everyone has adrenal glands, including ferrets. These tiny organs are located
very close to the kidneys. In a nutshell, adrenal glands produce extremely
important hormones that help regulate blood glucose levels and electrolyte
levels, increase musculature, and help the ferret in times of stress. Different

areas of the adrenal glands are responsible for producing different hormones.
For instance, small amounts of sex hormones, or “sex steroids,” are produced
by these glands.
Adrenal gland disease is extremely common in ferrets, but no one knows
exactly why. The adrenal glands can start overproducing sex steroids that act
the same way excessive amounts of the sex hormones testosterone and prog-
esterone would act. Usually starting out as hyperplasia, the adrenal glands
produce more gland tissue, which results in excessive hormone production.
As the disease progresses, however, neoplasia (cancer) can develop. Fortunately
for ferrets, metastasis, or spreading of the cancer beyond the adrenal gland(s)
to other organs, doesn’t happen often.
The disease can strike ferrets as young as 2 years old, but it commonly hits
ferrets that are 3 and older. Many theories exist pertaining to the cause:
 Some people suspect the problem has something to do with early neu-
tering, which I define as neutering before puberty or prior to sexual
development.
 Others believe adrenal gland disease is caused by the unnatural light
cycles that ferrets experience while living in people’s homes. These light
cycles differ greatly from what the ferrets would experience naturally in
the wild.
 Still others believe that prolonged stress may be a factor. Perhaps the
cause is a combination of all these things.
The signs of adrenal gland disease depend largely on which hormones are
being produced, the gender of the ferret, and the stage of the disease’s devel-
opment. Within these factors, the signs may include the following:
 Hair loss on the tail/body
Hair loss on the tail and/or body is one of the most common signs of
adrenal gland disease. However, it doesn’t have to be present for adrenal
gland disease to exist. Hair loss can come and go. A ferret may lose all
her tail fur only to have it grow back thick and fluffy later on. Some may
attribute this phenomenon to a seasonal coat change. It is, however,
thought to be the early stage of adrenal gland disease — hyperplasia
that temporarily resolves itself. As the disease progresses, hair loss usu-
ally starts on the tail and progresses up the body. The hair loss, if
adrenal-gland related, is always symmetrical. Sometimes, ferrets lose all
but their socks and hats.
 Excessive itchiness, with or without crusts, redness, or flaking
 Swollen vulva in spayed females (see Figure 16-1)
276
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Aggressive mating behavior (in neutered males)
 Unusual aggressive behavior (in either gender) toward owners or cagemates
 Difficulty urinating for males that develop enlarged prostates
 Anemia in females
 Some muscle thinning, weakness, or a potbellied appearance
Making the diagnosis
Diagnosing adrenal gland disease can, at times, be pretty easy. In many cases,
just looking at the ferret is enough. If she’s experiencing serious hair loss
alone or if the hair loss is coupled with any of the other common signs, she
probably has adrenal gland disease. However, it’s very important that you
take your fuzzy to your vet as soon as you notice a symptom of the disease.
The unfortunate thing is, a fuzzy can be suffering from adrenal gland disease
and show no signs for a very long time. Your vet may get lucky and detect an
enlarged adrenal gland during a routine physical examination, but this doesn’t
usually happen.

Chapter 16: Finding and Treating the Big C and Other Lumps

Because the adrenal glands are so tiny, an ultrasound of the abdomen often
will miss the early stages of adrenal gland disease. Running more bloodwork
and taking X-rays won’t help in diagnosing adrenal gland disease, either.
However, it’s common for a ferret with adrenal gland disease to have another
disease present, as well. Therefore, you should consider asking for additional
bloodwork and X-rays anyway so that you and your vet can develop a treat-
ment plan that’s suitable for your pet’s special needs.
After you discover some symptoms, you and your vet may opt to send your
fuzzy’s blood to the University of Tennessee, where experts can perform a
test that’s helpful in diagnosing adrenal gland disease. The experts can
perform an adrenal-gland panel to evaluate the levels of sex steroids in your
ferret’s system. This is one way to zero in on a diagnosis — especially in
cases where the diagnosis isn’t so obvious.
Many vets will suggest surgically removing the affected adrenal gland(s) with-
out going to extreme diagnostic measures if the major signs of the disease are
already there.
Treating the disease
When it comes to treating adrenal gland disease, you have a few options to
consider, which may be used independently or together. Many variables will
come into play, such as the age and health of your ferret and your financial
situation, but undoubtedly your vet will help you decide what’s best for you
and your ferret. One option, which is frequently recommended, is surgery.
However, some medications may also have a positive effect in treating
adrenal gland disease and/or managing its signs.
Surgery
The adrenal gland disease treatment most effective and most often opted for
is surgical removal of one or both adrenal glands. Adrenal gland surgery is a
fairly common procedure. Your ferret may be a candidate if she’s in good
health otherwise and can withstand general anesthesia. Another option is to
debulk, or surgically remove, as much adrenal tissue as possible, followed by
medical therapy. Post-operative prognosis is pretty good but depends on the
tumors present and what else is going on inside the ferret’s body. After the
diseased gland(s) is removed, the signs gradually disappear. The ferret’s fur
usually grows back, although it can take many months. The fur also may be
thinner and a different color.
Ferrets are prone to developing multi-organ diseases, so when your vet per-
forms an abdominal exploratory surgery on your ferret, ask him to take a
good look around inside your fuzzy. Your vet should check the condition of
her adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, intestines, spleen, and kidneys, which
only takes a couple extra minutes. Biopsies can be performed on anything
278
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

suspicious, and your vet can remove anything obvious right then and there.
Early detection of disease can prolong your fuzzy’s life and make medical
management more successful.
What if surgery isn’t the right option for your ferret? Reasons may include the
following:
 Your fuzzy is at an advanced age.
 Your fuzzy has other complicating diseases, such as advanced heart 
disease.
 Maybe your own fears are preventing you from going the preferred surgi-
cal route.
Well, if surgery isn’t an option for you, fuzzies can live up to three years com-
pletely untreated. However, your ferret may experience behavioral changes,
or other medical conditions may develop, such as prostate problems, as a
result of untreated adrenal gland disease. Sometimes her fur will grow back at
the next seasonal coat change. But affected ferrets usually lose more hair the
next time around. And it may not grow back at all.
Other treatment options
You do have alternative medical options to treat adrenal gland disease —
some of which have been used with great results. The following list outlines
some of these options and what they can do for your sick fuzzy: (Note: Not all
adrenal ferrets are candidates for alternative treatments. Speak with your vet
about what’s right for your furkid.)
 Medical therapy alone is an alternative treatment option.
 Lupron depot (the long-acting lupron), also known as Lueprorlin in
Europe, is currently the most widely used adrenal medication because
it’s safe for ferrets. The medication has very few, if any, known side
effects and can be ordered directly from your vet. It acts by stopping the
LH (Luteinizing Hormone) stimulation to the adrenal glands. In turn, the
adrenal glands stop overproducing adrenal androgens and sex hor-
mones. In carcinomas (cancer), Lupron may keep tumors from getting
bigger, but Lupron does nothing directly to shrink tumors. Lupron can
be an expensive treatment option, and it’s necessary for the remainder
of the ferret’s life.
Suprelorin implants are currently being used in Australia, New Zealand,
and a few other countries. Perhaps in the near future this option will be
available to our ferrets, as well. This medication works like Lupron, stop-
ping the LH stimulation to the adrenal glands and turning off the over-
production of sex hormones and adrenal androgens.
279
Chapter 16: Finding and Treating the Big C and Other Lumps

 Giving a ferret melatonin (orally or through implants) is another popular
medical approach to treating adrenal disease. Some ferret owners have
used this option as a preventative. It works by lowering LH, sex hor-
mone, and androgen levels. However, some are concerned that ferrets
may develop immunity to melatonin after long-term use, rendering it rel-
atively useless. Like Lupron and Suprelorin, it does nothing directly to
stop the progression of the disease. Also, because it’s a relatively new
treatment, the long-term effects are as yet unknown.
Melatonin implants can be used in conjunction with adrenal surgery or
along with Lupron. In fact, your veterinarian may recommend it.
Prostate problems in the male ferret often are associated with adrenal gland
disease. The overproduction of the testosterone-like sex steroid causes the
prostate to enlarge. Some enlarged prostatic tissue can apply pressure on the
urinary tract, leading to the ferret having difficulty urinating or creating uri-
nary blockage. Ferrets can develop bacterial infections in the prostatic tissue
leading to more serious disease. (Bacterial infections need to be treated with
appropriate antibiotics.) Lupron, in high doses, inhibits the production of sex
steroids, causing the prostate to shrink back to normal size.
Insulinoma
Insulinoma is one of the most diagnosed ferret cancers. A ferret with insuli-
noma has cancer of the insulin-secreting pancreatic cells, or beta cells. One of
the pancreas’s main roles is to release insulin as needed to regulate the
ferret’s blood sugar levels. It does its job by facilitating the movement of glu-
cose out of the bloodstream and into the cells, which use it as a primary fuel
source. In ferrets with insulinoma, tumors cause an overproduction of
insulin. Too much glucose moves out of the bloodstream quickly, which
causes rapid drops in blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. And without blood glu-
cose, the ferret’s brain and red blood cells are left with little to no fuel to
maintain.
Insulinoma most often strikes ferrets after the age of 3. Sometimes, the dis-
ease goes unnoticed for a long time as the ferret’s system fights to regulate
its own blood sugar levels. During this time, the signs may not be overly
apparent. When they do show up, some of the signs may include
 Weakness and lethargy
 Excessive salivation
 Pawing at the mouth
 Dazed and confused look
 Tremors and seizures
280
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Loss of coordination
 Rear leg weakness
 Enlarged spleen
 Coma
With insulinoma, the signs may come and go as the ferret’s body works to
counteract the swings in blood glucose by producing more glucose from the
liver. Things that can trigger and aggravate the signs include exercise, stress,
and diet (see the upcoming sidebar for more on diet and the possible causes
of insulinoma). However, any of the signs warrants a trip to the vet.
Making the diagnosis
A vet usually obtains a diagnosis by drawing a fasting blood sugar level, in
which the fuzzy goes three to four hours without food before the blood is
drawn. Anything longer than three to four hours is too long for a ferret with
insulinoma to go without food. Normal blood glucose levels are between 90
and 120. Having a fasting blood glucose level of less than 70 generally is con-
sidered diagnostic for insulinoma. If you want to take the diagnostic process
a step further, exploratory surgery will confirm the presence of insulinoma
tumors.
Treating the disease
Your vet can help you determine the best course of action to treat insulinoma,
based on your ferret’s history and current condition. Surgery is frequently an
option and may stop or slow the progression of insulinoma. Unfortunately,
pancreatic tumors can be small and seedy nodules, located throughout the
pancreas, making the treatment process surgically challenging. In some 
cases, the tumors are isolated nodules that can be more easily removed. And
although surgery can stop or slow the progression of the disease, the condi-
tion is never completely curable. Tumors frequently return at a later date.
Your fuzzy may live an additional ten months or longer after diagnosis, with a
lot of tender, loving care and a consistent management program, including
dietary changes (see Chapter 8). Some of the medications that vets have
found to be successful in managing insulinoma are diazoxide (Proglycem)
and corticosteroids (such as prednisone). Only your vet can determine
what’s best for your ferret.
281
Chapter 16: Finding and Treating the Big C and Other Lumps

People often recommend that you add Brewer’s yeast to the insulinoma
patient’s diet. I suggest that you not do this. The chromium in Brewer’s yeast
has been shown to actually lower blood sugar levels as opposed to stabilizing
them, as once thought.
Every ferret owner should keep some Karo syrup or honey on hand, espe-
cially if you have a ferret with insulinoma. If your fuzzy crashes (shows
extreme lethargy, weakness, or has seizures) due to low blood sugar, take a
cotton swab and dab a little honey or Karo syrup on her gums. The sugar
helps to stabilize the ferret until you can get her to a vet, which you should
do as quickly as possible. Follow up with some high-protein food like chicken
baby food.
Use this type of sugar boost in emergency situations only — to bring your
ferret out of a hypoglycemic episode. Too much sugar can be dangerous for a
fuzzy with insulinoma.
Lymphosarcoma (Lymphoma)
Very common in beloved furballs is lymphosarcoma, a cancer of the lym-
phatic system (the organs and cells designed to fight disease). Many fuzzies
suffering from this type of cancer can have severely impaired immune sys-
tems, while other ferrets are subclinical — they have no overt signs of the 
disease at all. The cause of lymphosarcoma remains a bit of a mystery.
Environmental and genetic influences are possible factors. Some experts are
convinced that lymphosarcoma is linked directly to some type of virus. The
condition sometimes shows up in multiple cagemates, reinforcing the viral
theory by implying some sort of viral transmission.
The two most common types of lymphosarcoma in ferrets are juvenile lym-
phosarcoma (lymphoblastic form), which hits furkids typically under the age
of 14 months, and classic lymphosarcoma (lymphocytic form), which gener-
ally is diagnosed in middle-aged and older ferrets. Because of the instances of
subclinical ferrets, lymphosarcoma isn’t always easy to recognize. Thankfully,
many ferrets may show signs, including
 Lethargy
 Extreme weight loss
 Diarrhea
 Labored breathing
 Loss of appetite
 Enlarged spleen
 Enlarged lymph nodes (locally or throughout the body)
282
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Making the diagnosis
In juvenile lymphosarcoma, death can occur suddenly and with no signs,
because the disease raids many organs at once. Vets often misdiagnose any
warning signs that do exist in the youngsters as an upper respiratory infec-
tion, pneumonia, or cardiomyopathy. This is due mainly to respiratory and
circulatory distress resulting from large, fast-growing tumors that invade the
chest cavity and squish the lungs.
Classic lymphosarcoma, on the other hand, is more often recognized by vets.
Unlike with the juvenile version, classic lymphosarcoma frequently causes
enlarged lymph nodes that a vet can easily feel under the armpits and on the
neck. The vet should confirm diagnosis with a biopsy of a lymph node, bone
marrow, spleen, or chest fluid. Often, irregularities in the ferret’s complete
blood count raise a red flag, but that isn’t always the case. It’s always best to
send out biopsy samples to a pathologist.
Treating the disease
Some fuzzy cancers, including lymphosarcoma, respond pretty well to
chemotherapy. For many ferrets, chemotherapy provides a decent remission
rate (with the exception of the intestinal form of lymphosarcoma), with life
often prolonged 6 to 36 months from the start of treatment. However, this
form of treatment can be very expensive, and not all cancer patients are good
chemo candidates. You must talk to your vet about all your possible treat-
ment options.
Some signs of lymphosarcoma can be alleviated temporarily with steroids,
but this treatment isn’t a cure for the condition.
Chordomas
Chordomas are the most common musculoskeletal tumors found in the ferret.
It’s difficult to explain these icky tumors without first giving you a simple
lesson on a complex matter of development. All developing embryos have
certain tissues that develop to form their basic support systems, such as the
spine (including the tail). Leftover embryonic tissue that doesn’t develop into
the skeletal structure rests in between the vertebrae. These remnants some-
times continue to grow, causing the formation of chordomas.
The mass often grows slowly at the tip of the ferret’s tail, eventually giving
the tail a club-like appearance. The tumor itself is made up of a bony center
beneath a layer of cartilage and rough cells that resemble red, raw elephant
skin. For the Herculean fuzzbutt, this tumor can be quite a weapon.
283
Chapter 16: Finding and Treating the Big C and Other Lumps

Chordomas are easily diagnosed and typically appear in fuzzies over 3 years
old. The most common ferret chordoma is located on the tip of the tail. In
some rare instances, a chordoma grows in between the vertebrae near the
head, in a tumor called a cervical chordoma. This more serious tumor can
cause compression of the spinal cord, at which point the ferret becomes
physically impaired. Cervical chordomas also are more apt to spread and
cause severe pain and neurological problems.
Chordomas can present more than just cosmetic problems for your ferret.
They frequently cause hair loss on and surrounding the tumor. Often, the
mass becomes ulcerated and oozy. Because of its vulnerable location and the
probability of trauma to the tail, vets generally recommend removal, which is
a relatively simple procedure.
Itchy Growths: Skin Tumors
Skin tumors appear in all shapes and sizes on fuzzy friends. The good news is
that the majority of these skin tumors are benign, or non-cancerous. However,
all are capable of becoming malignant, or cancerous. Vets usually recommend
the removal of the lump, bump, or ugly formation. Although the most common
ferret skin tumors rarely develop into cancer, the possibility will always
remain if you don’t have a tumor removed.
Also, several types of skin tumors are itchy and easy to rub and irritate.
Removing a tumor from your ferret eliminates the risk of her developing sec-
ondary infections from open sores. Be sure to send a tumor tissue sample to a
lab for analysis, just for peace of mind. If your vet suspects cancer, removal of
a nearby lymph node for biopsy also is a good idea to determine if the cancer
has spread. You and your vet can determine a course of treatment from there.
Remember: The earlier you act, the better chance you give your fuzzy!
Many types of skin tumors can afflict ferrets. The following sections touch on
the most common skin tumors.
Mast cell tumors
Mast cells are directly related to the immune system. They produce histamines
to combat foreign bodies in the ferret’s system. For reasons unknown, these
cells may migrate and form small tumors on the ferret’s skin. The growths
can appear anywhere on your fuzzy as a single tumor or multiple tumors.
284
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Mast cell tumors often are round, slightly raised red lumps — button-like in
appearance. Sometimes they’re flat and scaly in appearance. Because of the
ferret’s constant production of histamines, this type of tumor is extremely
itchy. You’ll know something’s up if you witness your poor ferret scratching
feverishly at her skin (at the area of the tumor), causing excessive bleeding
and oozing. Also, the site usually shows some hair loss and may be scabbed
over from the constant irritation.
Although mast cell tumors often are malignant in other animals, they rarely
become cancerous in ferrets. Nonetheless, because of the risk of infection
and the obvious discomfort your fuzzy feels, you should be a nice human and
have any mast cell tumors removed. Always have a biopsy done. You should
also expect more, though, because they frequently pop up in other places.
285
Chapter 16: Finding and Treating the Big C and Other Lumps
Tumor talk
Allow me to try to unravel the mystery of tumors
and the terms used to describe them. Neoplasia
is the process in which cells grow in an abnor-
mal and uncontrolled manner. The result is a
neoplasm, also known as a tumor, which is
made up of cells that serve no useful purpose to
the body. Tumors may occur just about any-
where on the ferret’s body — either externally
on the skin or internally.
There are two types of tumors: Benign (non-
cancerous) and malignant (cancerous). A
benign tumor remains local, or at the site where
it originally grows. Although it doesn’t spread,
or metastasize, to other parts of the body, it may
grow big enough to become medically danger-
ous. Some tumors also have the potential to
become malignant. A malignant tumor can
metastasize through neoplastic cells being
shed; these cells then travel to other areas of
the body, such as the lungs, liver, brain, and
lymph nodes. The rate of metastasis depends on
the type of tumor and many other factors relat-
ing to the individual animal.
The suffix –oma doesn’t designate a tumor as
benign or malignant. For instance, lymphoma
usually is malignant but may occur as a solitary
tumor that doesn’t spread; this is rare but possi-
ble (in people). An adenoma is a benign tumor —
specifically a benign epithelial tumor having a
glandular origin and structure. Adenocarcinoma
is a malignant tumor originating in the glandular
tissue. Carcinoma always means malignant; it’s
an invasive malignant tumor derived from epithe-
lial tissue that tends to metastasize to other
areas of the body. Approximately 80 percent of
all malignant tumors are carcinomas (in humans).
You can’t always tell whether a tumor is benign
or malignant just by looking at it with the naked
eye or by where it resides. A pathologist exam-
ines the tissues microscopically to determine
the tumor type, which is why sending tissues off
to a lab is so important.

Basal cell tumors
Basal cell tumors are slow-growing, wart-like nodules that feature little craters
in the middle. They can pop up anywhere on your ferret. They’re loose on the
skin and move freely when you push on them.
Because of their raised presentation and mobility, basal cell tumors are easy
to rub or scrape, which presents the possibility of infection. For these very
same reasons, basal cell tumors are easy to remove, and you should have
them removed. If removed properly by your vet, the tumors shouldn’t recur
in the same place.
Sebaceous cell tumors
Sebaceous cell tumors generally are tumors of the skin’s oil glands or hair folli-
cles. They’re really funky in shape — sometimes branching out like cauliflower.
They may appear as bluish-colored lumps just under the skin, although on the
outside they can range in color from tan to brown to blue. Like the other
common skin tumors, sebaceous cell tumors can appear anywhere on the
fuzzy’s body, and they’re usually firm to the touch.
Removing sebaceous cell tumors is important because they often grow
rapidly and can become cancerous. Besides, your ferret won’t like sporting a
vegetable-shaped mass for all the world to see.

 Coming to the aid of your surviving pets
W
ell, I suppose this topic had to come up eventually: death, the taboo
and rarely-talked-about elephant in the room. Naturally, humans are
never quite prepared for the death of a greatly cherished pet. The end always
seems to come way too soon. And what’s so unfortunate is that many humans
don’t know what they have until it’s gone. Thankfully, many more humans
cherish every breath their pets take, knowing all too well that each breath
could be the last.
It’s difficult to watch a beloved pet suffer. And for the true animal lovers, it
never seems to matter how long the pets have been with them. I can still
remember and feel the passing of every single fuzzy that has died since they
first graced me with their presence. And with each death came the same
questions, over and over and over again: Did I do something wrong? What
more could I have done? Was this the right time to let go? Why this little girl?
Why now?
This chapter deals with death head-on. In this chapter, I talk about knowing
when to euthanize your pet. I discuss what you can learn from a postmortem
examination. I present some options for humanely and compassionately
taking care of your deceased pet’s body. Finally, I cover coping with the griev-
ing process. I try to help you with your grief and your other fuzzies’ grief so
you can move on — but never forget.

Letting Go of Your Family Member
Sometimes, the only way people can truly show their love for their pets is to
let them go. Pets count on humans day after day to make the right decisions
for them, and the day will come when they must count on us to make that
final, heartbreaking decision — to be selfless instead of selfish and end their
suffering. In their eyes we’ll see. In our hearts we’ll know.
It’s time to let go when your fuzzy no longer enjoys life. His illnesses or
injuries have been treated as well as they can be, yet he continues to suffer.
Little hope exists, and your fuzzy’s time from here on out will be filled with
pain and misery. Stop. Look. Listen. Your fuzzy will tell you he’s ready to go if
you’re willing to listen closely.
You can set up your fuzzy’s final day with your vet. Humane euthanasia is
painless to your fuzzy. It involves overdosing the ferret on an anesthetic,
either by gas or by injection. Your baby will slowly fall to sleep. For the first
time in a long time, he’ll feel no pain; he’ll be free from the suffering. In only a
few short moments, he’ll pass over the Rainbow Bridge — a term that comes
from a poem by the same name, referring to an animal’s passage from life to
death — and be greeted by all the other pets that went before him. He’ll once
again be able to romp and play, and he’ll watch you from afar until the day
you can join him again.
And as hard as it may be for you, it will be comforting for your fuzzy if you’re
there with him. He’ll want to hear your soothing voice and feel your touch
while he leaves this world.
Many people ignore another important aspect to consider upon the death of
a pet, be it from euthanasia or from a natural death at home. The other ani-
mals that the deceased pet had contact with — particularly any siblings or
animals that were part of the fuzzy’s social group — should be able to see
and smell the deceased pet. It may seem “gross” to some people, but the
remaining animals should be able to understand what happened so they can
settle back into a normal life instead of always being concerned about where
the deceased pet is. Other animals can have abrupt and dramatic behavioral
changes when a beloved companion “disappears.”
The other animals will have a far smoother transition if they have time to
smell and see their dead cagemate. This may mean bringing the other social
members to the vet’s office, or at least a cagemate or two, or bringing the
body home for a while and then returning it to the vet.

Learning from Fuzzy’s Death 
with a Postmortem
It seems an impossible thought right after your fuzzy dies. No way will you
allow a vet to operate on your newly deceased baby and examine him just
out of curiosity. Well, you may want to think twice about your apprehensions.
Necropsies, or postmortems, are performed shortly after the death of an
animal and serve many important functions, which I outline in the following
list.
A necropsy is simply a postmortem examination of an animal. An autopsy is a
postmortem examination of a human, “auto” meaning “self” or “of the same
species.” Postmortem is Latin for “after death.”
 A postmortem may shed light on sudden, unexpected ferret deaths.
Not all animals give many warning signs before leaving this world. Some
die quite unexpectedly and throw their humans into emotional tailspins.
You may want some answers to the questions buzzing around in your
head.
 You and your other pets could have something to worry about. The
fear of something contagious enters everyone’s head at one time or
another. If your ferret’s death is a surprise, you may want to know if you
can expect more problems down the road or if you can prevent other
surprises. And remember, animals can pass some icky cooties to
humans, too.
 A postmortem can provide invaluable information to the veterinary
community about ferret disease and treatments. Your fuzzy’s death 
can assist other ferrets and their owners by providing precious data to
veterinarians — data that can strengthen or weaken theories relating to
ferret diseases and illnesses. The postmortem can also give clues as to
what does and doesn’t work in terms of treating fuzzies. The more a vet
sees and learns, the greater help the vet will be to ferrets in the future.
 A postmortem may reveal internal genetic abnormalities, which some-
times are the result of poor breeding. An examination can reveal dis-
eases or illnesses that hadn’t previously been identified in your ferret.
As horrible as this may sound, if your ferret was a new purchase, you
may be able to use the information from a postmortem to get your
money back or to get a new fuzzy. At the very least, you may be able to
help future fuzzies and owners from the fate you’ve witnessed.
 You can find out if husbandry played a role in the ferret’s death. Diet
and environment play big parts in the health of a fuzzy. Experts aren’t
the only ones who can learn from their mistakes. I know I’d want to cor-
rect any deficiencies on my part and prevent future pet losses.
289
Chapter 17: Saying Goodbye When the Time Comes

For an accurate and complete postmortem, your fuzzy’s body must be fresh.
So what should you do if your pet passes at home and you want a vet to per-
form a postmortem? Place his body in a bag (double bagging is recom-
mended) or container and put him in the fridge until the time comes. Don’t
freeze him or leave him at room temperature, because these environments
can damage tissues and organs. Freezing, for instance, causes changes in tis-
sues microscopically and makes it more difficult to do pathology or micro-
scopic examinations. You can, however, freeze a body if you need to for just a
gross postmortem or if you’re looking for viral problems.
Your vet may or may not charge you for the postmortem. Most vets do
charge a fee. It depends on their curiosity and desire to learn more about
fuzzies. Some vets do the gross necropsy (dissecting and evaluating) for free
and charge only for samples sent to pathologists or laboratories for testing.
If you choose to have a postmortem performed, your vet will, upon request,
stitch up any incisions after the exam is completed. Your ferret won’t look
exactly like your little baby, but he won’t look like Frankenfert, either. Keep in
mind that the body is only the package that your fuzzy arrived in. He’s no
longer in there; he’s opted for a superior package deal over the Rainbow
Bridge.
Having a necropsy performed is a difficult decision. I’ve always been told
never to make a decision when I’m hungry, angry, lonely, or tired (HALT). You
can probably throw grieving into that mix, too, but then it wouldn’t spell a
word. Chances are you aren’t reading this material to figure out what to do at
this very moment. You should think about postmortems now, before you’re
too emotional, and make a decision about what you’ll do when your beloved
ferret dies.
Selecting Fuzzy’s Final Burrowing Place
What comes after the death of your ferret? Grieving, sadness, emptiness,
anger, fear, loneliness. The list goes on and on. An important part of grieving,
though, is putting some closure on the loss. A big part of getting closure is
deciding what to do with your deceased pet. You have several options. It’s no
longer a choice between burying him in the backyard, tossing him out with
the trash, or leaving him at the vet for convenience:
 Some people have their pets cremated.
 Some people have elaborate funerals at pet cemeteries complete with
caskets and grave markers.
290
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

 Some people have their pets freeze-dried or stuffed (taxidermied).
 Some people opt for a simple or extravagant backyard funeral.
The following sections present some of these popular options.
Choosing cremation
Your vet will, upon request, properly store your deceased pet and arrange for
a pet crematory to pick up the body for cremation. You also can take your pet
directly to a pet crematorium with prior arrangement. Your cremation
options are offered for different prices and vary from vet to vet and from cre-
matorium to crematorium. If you choose this route, though, you usually have
two main options:
 A mass cremation without the return of your pet’s ashes. The crematory
disposes of all ashes according to the law.
 A special cremation with the return of your pet’s ashes. This includes a
guarantee (complete with a certificate) that your deceased pet was cre-
mated separately from other animals, assuring that all ashes are your
pet’s and only your pet’s.
If you choose a special cremation, you need to think about your options for
the returned ashes:
 You can keep each pet separated in special containers. These containers
can sit on special shelves or in other special places of honor.
 You can have one big urn in which you keep all your pets together as a
family.
 You can bury the ashes or spread them in your pet’s favorite outdoor
place. I emphasize outdoor because your fuzzy’s favorite hidey-hole in
the play area probably isn’t a good idea!
Your vet or the pet crematorium should be able to give you prices for these
services and show you several urn styles. You can bypass your vet or the cre-
matorium and even purchase urns online. Some urns are simple, and some
are elaborate. The style you choose depends on your taste and your budget.
You can add an engraved nameplate or simply have the pet’s name etched in
wood. Some people even add a little picture of the pets to the containers.
This is a time for celebration of your pet’s life.
291
Chapter 17: Saying Goodbye When the Time Comes

If you choose to receive only the ashes back without a special urn, be pre-
pared for what you may get. Most of my pets’ ashes were returned in small,
white, plastic bottles or decorative tins. One time, though, some ashes came
back in a clear plastic bag, which was both startling and disturbing to me.
Not all pet crematoriums are up to snuff. People, in some cases, get back way
more than just their pets’ ashes, or it may be apparent that not all the ashes
could’ve possibly been returned. Be careful which crematorium you choose.
Speak with your vet about the crematorium she uses. Call a referred cremato-
rium and ask questions. If you’re unhappy with the answers you get, you can
take your pet to another place. The choice is yours. Some crematoriums even
let you stay there while the service is performed.
Proceeding to a pet cemetery
No, a pet cemetery isn’t anything like author Stephen King’s portrayal. Thank
heavens! In fact, pet cemeteries look a lot like human cemeteries, except
much smaller. Many people love this resting option because they’ll always
have a special place to visit their beloved pets. Finding them, however, can
be challenging, although some crematoriums have cemeteries on site. Pet
cemeteries aren’t all that popular, and many people don’t even know they
exist. Ask your vet to point you in the right direction, or contact a friend who
has some experience with one. You can also perform an Internet search or
check out the phone book under “pet cemetery.”
The burial for your pet can be simple, such as you picking out a tiny site and
delivering the body to the cemetery. Or it can be extravagant. You can have
your ferret set up in a special coffin, and you can view the body in the funeral
home before saying goodbye, just like at a human wake. Some places allow
you to deliver the pet, in coffin, to the burial site and bury the pet yourself.
Or you can follow a somber ground crew as they lead you to the burial site.
You can purchase a headstone so that your fuzzy’s gravesite will always be
marked with sentiment.
The pet cemetery burial option can be a costly endeavor. Pet cemeteries vary
in policies and practices. I’m sure they also differ in prices and available
packages.
Opting for a backyard burial
Backyard burials can be personal, private, and inexpensive, and they can
mean everything to a grieving human. Many families with kids know exactly
what I’m talking about. How many of you, as tearful children, made your
family members gather around the toilet to bid farewell to the bravest,
coolest goldfish that ever lived?
292
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

Before you decide to bury your pet in the backyard, be sure to check city
ordinances; backyard burials may actually be illegal in your area.
Headstones are optional for your backyard burial. For my old dog Ara, I
custom-designed a headstone and had it etched in heavy granite by the
stonecutter at the local cemetery. It took forever for the stone to arrive, but it
was well worth the wait. Of course, after I spent $350, I started getting dozens
of pet catalogs offering low-cost, simple pet headstones. But none could com-
pete with my personal touch. (Read the sidebar “A personal story” for more
about my sweet wolfdog, Ara.)
If your deceased pet was especially close to your child, you may want to
encourage your child to celebrate the pet’s life by personally making a head-
stone or grave marker. It’s a wonderful way for the child to put a little closure
on this huge matter of loss.
Note (actually a Hubby Alert): Just as a matter of clarification, my buried
pets will be packed up and moved with me if I ever move from my house.
They’ll then be reburied in a beautiful place in my new yard. I’ve warned you,
Hubby! You think I’m kidding? Here it is in writing!
Grieving for Your Lost Fuzzy
I’ll tell you right off the bat: There’s nothing worse than grieving a loss that
no one seems to understand. People can sometimes make you feel worse
about the death of your pet. Someone who has never had a pet may proclaim,
“It’s only an animal.” Well, not exactly. Pets are family members that you grow
extremely attached to. Your ferret has been a source of comfort and joy, as
well as sadness and frustration. Many people view pets just as they view
human children, but other people out there just don’t understand.
I’m surrounded by people who just don’t understand how I can cry over the
loss of a ferret or any other small critter. A dog or a cat they’d understand —
at least a little, so they say. And those who really have no clue rationalize,
“It’s not like they were humans.” Those are the people to avoid. Those are the
people who make me like animals more than people.
293
Chapter 17: Saying Goodbye When the Time Comes
Together through eternity
Due to popular demand, some human cemeter-
ies are making ground-breaking changes to
allow pets to be buried alongside their humans.
I love this idea! Except that even after all our
deaths, my spouse would still be complaining
that there are too many cats “hogging the bed.”

After the death of your furry friend, surround yourself with people who do
understand and don’t think you’re strange. I’ve seen people spend hundreds
of dollars to remove tumors from mice, rats, and guinea pigs. It isn’t the size
or cost of the animal that matters; it’s how much room he takes up in your
heart.
So, you have my first bit of advice: Surround yourself with the right people. In
the following sections, I give you more advice for dealing with your grief and
for helping others through their grief.
Know you’re not alone
You may feel crazy for feeling the way you do. Well, let me tell you, many of
us out there feel crazy and silly right along with you. Don’t let others kick you
when you’re down.
Many support groups are out there that deal directly with the loss of a
pet. You can do a search on the Internet. If you can, visit the Web site
www.rainbowsbridge.com. It’s a neat site that has many wonderful tips
and links to other pet-loss sites. It’s also a virtual memorial site. If you visit

A personal story
One of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made
was to put my 161⁄2-year-old wolfdog, Ara, to
sleep, but it was one I had to make. In the morn-
ing, he struggled to rise from his bed. He looked
at me with sad, helpless eyes as I lifted his back
end up for him. I saw that dignity still glowed
dimly in his eyes, but the light was fading and I
could tell he knew it. We romped slowly in the
yard before our vet, Mike, arrived to put him to
sleep. I questioned my decision as Ara walked
up almost briskly to greet Mike. Maybe it wasn’t
time. I’d made this decision several times in the
months before then and selfishly changed my
mind just as Mike arrived. But Ara was almost
17 years old and was no longer happy. He fought
to stay with us much longer than anyone had
expected such a large dog to. We moved Ara’s
bed outside, and he quickly went to it. As he
looked up at me, I could tell he trusted me to
make the right decision. I held him closely while
he left his broken-down body and passed over
the Rainbow Bridge.
In my backyard, I have a beautiful group of large
pine trees set in an imperfect row. Directly
below their towering branches are many
unmarked graves where dozens of critters rest.
Directly north of these graves lies underground
the most handsome, majestic, and loyal dog
anyone’s ever met. Ara Glen. His headstone
reads, “Always Faithful, Always Loved.” Ara is
the keeper and protector of my critter grave-
yard. He watches over the little guys and guides
them over the Rainbow Bridge. I visit his grave
often when I need to talk, and I know he under-
stands. This is why I planted him close to my
heart.

this site or other sites like it, you’ll find many hotlines and chat groups and
even books dealing with grief issues, all available for you and your family
members.
Face the feelings
A variety of different feelings will pop up at any given time after the death of
your fuzzy. Feel them. Don’t run from them. Remember that you’re not alone.
Your feelings are powerful, but they aren’t unique. Among the emotions that
will creep up for you to face are denial, anger, guilt, sadness, and emptiness.
Facing your feelings, however, doesn’t mean beating yourself up about what
you couldn’t help. We all think we could’ve been better pet humans after our
animals are gone, but hindsight is 20/20. Chances are, you were a wonderful
parent. Feelings are temporary. Your memories will last forever, but the pain
slowly fades after a while.
Give yourself time
Many people think that they should run right out and get new pets as soon as
they lose the ones they loved so dearly. They think that doing so will fix the
grief they’re feeling. It won’t. You know better than that. You can never replace
a lost family member.
Give yourself time to grieve your loss. Pets aren’t replaceable. You can cer-
tainly add to your family when you feel better, but taking on a new responsi-
bility when you’re grieving isn’t fair to you, your family, or the new pet.
Likewise, you shouldn’t try to fix someone else’s grief by giving a pet as a gift.
Grief isn’t something that can be fixed. It’s something that you must work
through over a period of time.
And when you’re truly ready for a new pet, toss any feelings of guilt or betrayal
out the window. Your deceased pet would’ve wanted you to move on and be
happy with a new pet.
Help others deal with their loss
You may want to giggle inside when you see a child dragging an adult to the
toilet for the ultimate farewell to Moby the goldfish. But you should recognize
that the child is hurting. It’s very possible that another person will feel the
295
Chapter 17: Saying Goodbye When the Time Comes

loss of your pet just as, or even more, deeply than you do. Respect other
people’s feelings by acknowledging them and providing as much support as
you can. Each person is unique, and everyone has the right to grieve.
Don’t forget that you have to help your other animals with their loss, too.
Animals bond deeply with both humans and other animals. When my wolfdog,
Ara, died, my hyper Doberman, Cassie, wanted to do nothing but sleep. She
was lethargic and depressed. Several months later, I introduced two puppies
to her, and she hated me for it. But they all play and get along today. However,
she has never bonded to them the way she did with Ara. My point is, show all
your grieving family members extra attention and love during the grieving
period. (See the following section for much more advice on this topic.)
Do pets really grieve? Many people, myself included, tend to project 
human emotions such as grief onto pets. The fact is, no one knows for sure 
if animals grieve, and the topic is a subjective one. Some will say the changes
in behavior that an animal experiences after a death are due to the changes
in environment — the safety and security of their “world” has been altered (a
cagemate suddenly disappears or social structure is disrupted). Depending
on the species and on the age of the animals and their health, it can affect
them more or less dramatically. You need to understand the social behavior
of a pet species to understand how the animals can respond to environmen-
tal changes.
Helping a Surviving Ferret Cope
Depression in animals isn’t much different than depression in humans, except
that animals don’t have complex self-destructive thought patterns. The loss
felt by a surviving ferret isn’t to be underestimated, though. Surviving ferrets
are affected very deeply. The signs are there. Lethargy and lack of appetite
may be glaringly obvious, as well as their reclusiveness or clinginess. And it
isn’t unheard of for a lone ferret to die soon after his cagemate passes on. But
you can do your part to help your surviving ferret get through these hard
times. It isn’t difficult. Ferrets are by nature solitary animals and usually do
just fine on their own after a period of adjustment.
You need to give your sad fuzzy a lot of extra attention during his grieving
stage. Spend more time developing and implementing enrichment plans to
keep him busy and entertained (see Chapter 10). The worst thing you can do
is isolate him. But be careful not to make too many abrupt changes in his life
by suddenly carrying him around more often than usual and stressing him
out. Over-babying him will only cause him to have more anxiety. Be aware of
your own agitation and depression and keep him out of contact with that. He
296
Part IV: Tackling Your Ferret’s Health Issues and Treatments 

doesn’t need to take on your stress as well. Realizing that life moves on will
also help with your grief. If you get stuck in your grief, you won’t be doing
any favors to your ferret.
When dealing with a grieving ferret, many people ask, “Should I get another
ferret? When will we know if it’s the right time?” Many factors come into play
when deciding whether to get a new ferret to keep your surviving ferret com-
pany. How old is your surviving ferret? If he’s old and sickly, adding a new-
comer is probably not a great idea. A surviving youngster may be a completely
different story, because he may have many healthy years to share with
another ferret. Take health and personality factors into consideration. What if
your survivor doesn’t get along with a new ferret? Are you ready to set up
and maintain another cage and split playtimes? And the biggest question of
all: Are you ready for a new ferret?
Many ferrets will benefit greatly from the company of a new ferret. But first
and foremost, you need to make a commitment to your surviving ferret to
truly meet his needs for consistent enrichment, which will keep him thriving.
Enrichment is vital to a ferret, but even more so to a ferret that lives alone.

“G
ood heavens! You mean I have to know more than
just how to feed, burp, and change diapers?” Well,
only if you want a truly happy and healthy carpet shark
living in your home. This part deals with understanding
ferret behaviors, quirks, and training issues. At the very
least, this part is designed to show you what is and isn’t
normal behavior. After all, how can you meet the needs of
any pet if you don’t understand its needs in the first place?
If, after reading the first two chapters in this part, you still
believe your furball is crazy, turn to the third chapter of
the part where I discuss behavior modification tips. I’m
here to tell you that you’re not alone. Being owned by 
ferrets can be challenging, but understanding them is the
key to making it all work.

Understanding What Fuzzy 
Is Trying to Tell You
In This Chapter
 Responding to various ferret sounds
 Reacting to your ferret’s dance moves
 Recognizing your ferret’s body language
 Considering other ways your ferret communicates
F
errets are extremely interactive critters. They use many different types
of communication to get their points across — from body language to
vocalizations to crazy behaviors. They can be notorious thieves and affec-
tionate lap warmers at the same time. Watching them can be both amusing
and baffling, but knowing what they’re trying to say to you is important. It
can mean the difference between a lick on the nose and a nip of the nostrils.
You’ll surely encounter all sorts of captivating behavior, both good and bad,
during your ferret rendezvous. My experience has been that the good
encounters are far more plentiful than the bad. I spend more time laughing
with my furballs, even when they’re being devilish. In this chapter, I cover the
main types of ferret communication so you can properly manage, care for,
and play with your ferret. I discuss ferret vocalization, ferret dancing, fuzzy
body language, and other unique behaviors. Hopefully, this chapter will help
you recognize that you’re not alone in thinking your ferret may be a little
crazy . . . and will put to rest any fears you have that you’re crazy for loving
every minute of it.
Say What? Speaking Ferret-ese
For the most part, fuzzies are quiet. I mean, goodness, they sleep for hours
on end! Occasionally, one of my furkids has a ferret dream and does a little
whimpering in her sleep, but that’s a rarity. During playtime, though, the
vocabulary comes out. Ferrets use vocalization to send signals. Seasoned

ferret humans (sprinkled with ferret poo) have personal terms for ferret
vocalizations that they’ve come up with over the years. These terms are sort
of like understood jokes between ferret and human. However, most fuzzy
humans recognize a few terms universally. I cover these vocalizations in the
sections that follow so you can speak the ferret language and understand
what your ferret wants.
People who don’t understand ferret communication can become frightened or
intimidated when encountering vocalizations for the first time. Recognizing
the difference between a dook of happiness and a screech of anger is impor-
tant. Not knowing may cause you to react improperly to the message being
given. Humans often run into this difficulty with their human partners, too!
The dook
The most common ferret babble is known as dooking (also known as clucking
or chuckling). It sounds like sort of a low-pitched, grumbling gibber. My fer-
rets frequently get a case of the verbal “hee hees” while they’re dooking.
Dookings are awesome sounds made out of sheer giddiness or excitement.
The stimulation felt from wrestling with another ferret, rapid counter cruis-
ing, or even from exploring new smells, toys, and hidey-holes can cause
carpet sharks to dook. Nothing to worry about here; just enjoy!
Mother jills (female ferrets) make a slightly different but similar noise to help
their kits (baby ferrets) locate them when the babies are exploring their envi-
ronment. Experts suggest that polecats also use a similar noise when first
meeting each other, during dancing used to avoid conflict, and before and
during ritual fighting.
The screech
The opposite of the dook is the certified sign of terror, the screech. These
noises are high-pitched reactions to extreme pain, fright, or anger. The
screech is a common defense mechanism and often is accompanied by or
even replaced by rapid chattering. When you hear this warning cry, your job
as a concerned parent is to jump to your fuzzy’s defense. Her tail may be
puffed and her back arched. She may have her mouth gaped open, and she
may even be scooting backward. Go to her rescue immediately, but be sure to
assess her body language before reaching down with your vulnerable hands.
When rushing to help your fuzzy, do so with care. Most animals engrossed in
pain, anger, or fright are capable of unpredictable behavior, and ferrets are no
exception to this rule.
302
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

The bark
Sometimes your ferret will surprise you and utter a noise that resembles a
bark. Usually, the bark is one or two very loud chirps that come from a very
excited or frightened furball. A friend of mine has a ferret that will bark if he
tries to take away its treasured dried fish or jerky. Some humans bark if you
prematurely remove their dinner plates, too.
A ferret that’s traumatized or excited enough to screech, hiss, or bark can
take temporary leave of her senses and nail you good with her chompers —
and it won’t be her fault. Many situations can cause screeching, barking, hiss-
ing, or chattering — from a serious fight between two rival ferrets to having a
tail caught in a door to coming face to face with a large, unfamiliar dog.
The hiss
The hiss is a warning noise in the ferret’s vocabulary. I find a ferret’s hissing
noise quite amusing, even if she doesn’t; it’s sort of a cross between a “hee
hee” and chattering. The noise can be in the form of long bursts of sound or
short, hissy spats, depending on the situation. A hissing fuzzy is a very
annoyed or angry fuzzy. Take care when handling this girl, because she’s
liable to lash out at you.
You Make Me Feel Like Dancin’!
Interpreting Your Ferret’s Jig
If you haven’t figured it out by now, ferrets are animated critters with a com-
plex array of behaviors. Often, a ferret’s vocalizations (described in the previ-
ous section) are accompanied by particular movements and body language —
such as opening the mouth, puffing the tail, arching the back, and so on —
that resemble dances. Reading between the lines can be difficult, if not alarm-
ing, to people who don’t know how to read ferret music. In the following sec-
tions, I help you interpret your ferret’s dances and take action accordingly.
The dance of joy
I don’t know of a ferret that hasn’t mastered the dance of joy (see Figure 18-1).
If you run across one, her ferret human is most certainly doing something 
terribly wrong. All healthy, happy ferrets partake in this frequent and brilliant
performance. The dance of joy is an unadulterated sign of pure happiness
303
Chapter 18: Understanding What Fuzzy Is Trying to Tell You

and delight. (Note: These dancers are professional ferrets. Don’t try these
moves at home. Doing so may cause irreparable damage to your skeletal
structure and harm your ego!)
To perform the dance, the ferret moves in all directions, sometimes at the
same time. She may hop forward and sashay sideways, with a double twist
back. No two dances are the same, yet all are amusing.
The dance of joy is a great way to gauge whether your ferret is in shape. A
very fit and energetic fuzzy will be the last one on the dance floor. Short
bursts of dancing performed between short ferret naps are also common. If
you find that your ferret is sleeping more than playing when she gains her
daily freedom, try giving her more exercise (see Chapter 10). If her energy
still seems low over time, take her to the vet for a checkup. You want to make
sure that her lack of energy isn’t more than just being flabby and out of
shape.
It’s probable that the dance of joy does a few things for the polecat:
 The arched back, piloerection (frizzed-out tail), and sway make the
animal look bigger than it is.
 The side-to-side swings may confuse a potential predator or make the
animal attack the tail rather than the head.

of joy.
304
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

 Several different species of weasels and polecats have used war dancing
to confuse or distract potential prey, increasing the odds of getting a
meal.
Ferrets do the dance as part of their “play fighting” behaviors. When doing
the dance for a human or to play with another ferret (or just on their own),
ferrets also open their mouths and sometimes dook.
The war dance
I like to call the war dance “dooking it out,” even though dooks aren’t associ-
ated with angry or fearful fuzzies (see the earlier section “The dook”).
Sometimes, recognizing the war dance can be difficult because the dance of
joy covers all the same basic body movements, including the notorious
arched back. But an angry ferret often hisses or screeches as an additional
warning. The war dance can be performed with or without a ferret partner.
Your ferret may choose you as a partner or the family dog. Or she may pick
out an inanimate object that happened to catch her off-guard.
The war dance often features an arched back, which is the furball’s way of
appearing bigger than life. I call it basic trickery. The dance can be slow or
fast, depending on the situation. Many angry ferrets back themselves into a
corner, arched back and all, and screech or hiss with their mouths wide open.
A very angry or frightened ferret also will let loose an A-bomb — a spray of
musk. Although a frizzed-out tail often is appropriate attire for the war dance,
it isn’t always worn.
If your ferret is in a bad situation, rescue the furkid quickly, but do so very
cautiously. A bite that results from an upset ferret is rarely the fault of the
ferret.
Decoding Your Ferret’s Body Language
Ferrets do a lot more than dance when they’re playing, inspecting, or explor-
ing their environments. They always seem to be on mysterious quests, which
sometimes feature about as much grace as a weasel in a lingerie drawer (not
that I would know). Some ferrets appear to feel bored and frustrated at times.
Some seem happy and silly. And others may just want to cool out in their
hidey-holes. In the following sections, I cover some peculiar behaviors that
ferrets exhibit alone and with each other. Hopefully you’ll get the insight
you’ve been looking for. Ferrets can be weird creatures!
305
Chapter 18: Understanding What Fuzzy Is Trying to Tell You

The frizz look
A true sign of excitement, both good and bad, is the frizzed-out tail. I call it
the “pipe cleaner tail,” and others call it the “bottlebrush tail.” The official
term is piloerection. When humans get piloerection, we call it goosebumps.
When ferrets get it, people call it frizzed or fuzzed. No matter what you call it,
if you aren’t reading the other signs that accompany the pipe cleaner tail, you
may be in for a surprise. Remember, the frizzed tail is a sign of extreme emo-
tion, good or bad. This ferret can be unpredictable.
The situation is similar to when dogs get hackles or when cats do that thing
with the fur on their tails. Ferrets puff out the fur on their tails when they’re
frightened or angry (and are more prone to biting). However, the frizzy look
can also be a sign of surprise or happy excitement. Each one of my furballs has
a frizzed tail for several minutes after bath time. They’re excited and overstim-
ulated while they search for creative ways to dry off and undo all the cleaning.
The alligator roll and wrestlemania
Okay, so your ferret doesn’t look like an alligator, but boy, can she flip and
roll her partner in seconds flat! I’ve seen all my ferrets perform the alligator
roll many times. The flip is just a form of playing or wrestling. The alpha
fuzzy, or head cheese, is the master. She quickly grabs another fuzzy by the
back of her neck and flips her upside down. Both carpet sharks then rapidly
roll and wrestle about.
There are several variations of wrestling that almost always come into play
when your ferrets are out of the cage. Many species of mammals participate
in these mock battles to sharpen their survival skills and establish their rank-
ings in the group.
Ferrets can appear to be quite aggressive during normal play. The rough play,
besides being fun, often is a way of establishing dominance. A ferret’s skin is
tough, and what appears to be ruthless biting may in fact just be a bother-
some pinch to the recipient. (Ferrets use their paws for grabbing at other fer-
rets, for tackling, and for wrestling them to the ground, but their teeth are
their main weapons.) One opponent may scream briefly in protest. Don’t
interfere unless you truly feel the game has turned into more than a game.
The trouble comes when a fuzzy chooses a human hand or toe or a piece of
clothing to perform an alligator roll on. Youngsters and overexcited ferrets in
play mode do this a lot. Although it can be amusing and innocent at first, this
behavior shouldn’t be encouraged. If you choose to play along with the roll
and wrestle with your ferret, use a toy to tackle and wrestle with rather than
your hand. You don’t want to encourage the fuzzy to bite your hand, and
biting is almost always a part of this game.
306
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

The treasure hunt
Next time you get invited to a party in which the host sends you and the rest
of the guests on a treasure hunt, grab your fuzzy to help in the search. Ferrets
make excellent detectives. The job of the fuzzy is to explore every inch, every
crack, and every scent of her environment, leaving nothing unexamined. A
ferret’s nose will be glued to the ground as she follows scent trails this way
and that. She’ll stop at nothing to get to know everything she can.
Because of a ferret’s determination and persistence to explore, proper ferret-
proofing is essential to your ferret’s safety (see Chapter 6). A ferret can find
anything that you don’t hide well enough. And when she finds it, she’ll hide
the stuff even better. This is called cache behavior. I’ve had ferrets present me
with cherished items I thought I’d never see again. At first I wanted to show
my excitement at the discoveries by rewarding the treasure hunters, but then
I realized that they probably hid the treasures in the first place.
The chase is on
Most animals love to chase each other, but ferrets are the masters at the
high-speed chase. The behavior may be the inner predator coming to the sur-
face, or it may just illustrate the ferret’s desire to have a good time.
Regardless, you don’t have to be a fuzzy to partake in chases. I’ve seen my
cats and several furkids cruising around the house at the speed of fuzz. I’ve
even done the ferret shuffle as quickly as I could to get away from a tailing
carpet shark.
Overly excited or happy ferrets can appear to be quite nuts. They bounce off
the walls, furniture, and body parts, often with their mouths gaping wide and
teeth showing. This behavior is normal. Many people mistakenly believe this
open-mouth gesture is aggression. Rather, it’s an invitation to play, and it’s all
part of ferret fun and games.
A ferret chase can be a dangerous behavior, though. Many dogs don’t like to
be chased by ferrets and will snap at them in retaliation. And kids who don’t
know how to properly perform the ferret shuffle shouldn’t chase because
they can easily step on fuzzies. The safest way for a person (adult or child) to
play chase with a ferret is to be on all fours on the ground. The fuzzy almost
always wins this way, and you reduce the risk of accidentally crushing her.
Did you know that ferrets and polecats aren’t typically chase hunters? They
hunt most of their food by uncovering it or by cornering it in tunnels. They
move very rapidly if you startle them, however, as if to avoid becoming food
for an owl!
307
Chapter 18: Understanding What Fuzzy Is Trying to Tell You

Fuzzy stalking
Sometimes a ferret remains very still before pouncing on another ferret or
toy. I call this behavior fuzzy stalking or the ambush. In this way, fuzzies are
similar to cats, although ambushing isn’t the preferred method of hunting by
the ferret’s wild relatives. A more serious variation of stalking is lunging. You
may encounter the lunge when a ferret is becoming overprotective of a spe-
cial toy or hidey-hole.
Tail wagging
Some ferrets wag their tails out of sheer excitement or stimulation. Some may
even do it when they’re upset. Tail wagging isn’t as common in fuzzies as it is
in cats, but it’s hardly cause for alarm when it does happen. Youngsters seem
more prone to this funny behavior. If your fuzzy is a tail wagger, you can say
that you have a furkid with a tad more character than the rest of the furkids.
“Why Does My Ferret Do That?”
Understanding Other Fuzzy Behaviors
Besides understanding vocalizations and body language, you need to know
what other behaviors come with the ferret package. I get calls from people
who proclaim excitedly that their ferrets hate the litter they’ve chosen. The
ferrets toss or dump the litter constantly. They ask me what secret litter I use
and what they can do to fix the problem.
Some ferret humans are relieved when I tell them that the problem probably
isn’t the litter. It’s a natural ferret behavior to dig. Or it can be due to bore-
dom and stress (see Chapter 10 for ideas on enrichment for your ferret).
Some ferret humans want a quick fix and seem frustrated with my answers. 
I tell these people that ferrets are crazy, which is why people love them so
much. In the sections that follow, I cover digging and the remaining fuzzy
behaviors that you should recognize and understand.
Digging to China
A ferret’s long claws weren’t put there just for looks, you know. Any ferret
owner will tell you that digging comes as naturally to a ferret as pooping.
Normal targets of digging include cage corners, litter boxes, potted plants,
and carpeting. If you think about it, though, the digging behavior makes
sense:
308
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

 Polecats, relatives of the ferret, are burrowing critters.
 Polecats and ferrets hunt by sense of smell. When a wild polecat locates
food with her sniffer, her claws dig in for the kill.
 Ferrets inherently know that digging drives humans right up the wall!
Another reason for digging that some people overlook is boredom or frustra-
tion. Although you can’t take the urge to dig out of the ferret, you must recog-
nize that ferrets need a lot of stimulation. Digging can, at times, be a way of
saying, “Pay attention to me!” or “I’ll get you for taking away my toy!” Or she
may simply be attempting to get out of her cage. For tips on how to enrich
your ferret’s life and prevent stress and boredom, refer to Chapter 10.
Although you can’t prevent a ferret from digging, you can do some things to
prevent damage done by your excavator (for more on ferret-proofing, see
Chapter 6):
 Keep your plants up high or cover the soil with wire, large decorative
rocks, or tin foil.
 For carpeting, you can try to use plastic carpet runners or simply
remove the carpeting where your fuzzy will be playing. Tile certainly is
easier to clean, also.
Ferret fixations
Your ferret may become fixated on a certain object and treat it with extra-
special care — even preventing others from getting near it. For some ferrets,
“fixation” is the understatement of the year. When a ferret claims her love for
an object, she often guards it tooth and nail.
My ferret Elmo discovered a toy from one of those fast-food kid’s meals
before I could even get it out of the plastic. It was a hard-plastic lion that he
grabbed and ran off with to his hidey-hole. After he’d familiarized himself
with it, he proudly brought the toy out to show off to his friends. But Elmo
never allowed anyone to get too close to it. Like a mother protecting her vul-
nerable baby, this oversized carpet shark hissed warnings to the other ferrets
to keep a safe distance.
Even today, Elmo has many toys, but this one is never far from his sight. He
carries it to the food bowl and drops it in while he eats, and then he carefully
buries it in his bedding when he’s through. The toy even accompanies him to
the litter box. Now that’s true love!
309
Chapter 18: Understanding What Fuzzy Is Trying to Tell You

The movers are here
What happens if your ferret becomes obsessed with something she just can’t
get her teeth around? Why, she simply tucks it under her belly and secures it
there with her front paws. From there, the thief amuses any onlookers with
her unique ability to scoot backward with the object in tow. Balls and small,
hard objects often are subjected to this tuck-and-scoot method of moving.
And what if the object is too big to tuck and scoot? Well, her pointy honker
isn’t just for smelling and leaving nose prints on your eyeglasses. And her
feet weren’t made just for walking. Ferrets can not only drag around heavy
objects, but also push them around (different from bossing us around). They
use their noses and/or front feet to push items to the desired destinations.
They’ll try for hours to shove oversized items into obviously undersized loca-
tions. My fuzzies frequently try to drag me under the couch. I never have the
heart to point out the flaw in their plan. I’m rather amused at watching them
try to make it work no matter what.
A felon on your hands?
Ferrets would make excellent crooks if they weren’t so darned blatant about
their thieving ways. It’s absolutely normal, even if sometimes annoying, for
ferrets to steal objects and carry them off to their secret hidey-holes. Heck,
the animal’s name appropriately means “thief” (see Chapter 2). This thieving
or hoarding is a caching behavior. It serves an important role in the survival
of wild polecats: as a way for them to stock up on food for future shortfalls.
Almost anything the ferret can grab with her paws or carry in her mouth is
fair game. From pieces of food to cigarette butts, you’ll find the most unusual
collections of goodies in the most unusual places. Purses, pockets, and back-
packs are frequent targets for ferret raids. If you value any items your ferret
may steal — such as car keys, shoes, and jewelry — I suggest that you keep
these items up high or away from the ferret’s play area altogether.
Hoarding is one of the ferret’s most endearing traits, but it can lead to trou-
ble. Some stolen items are big, but others are dangerously small. Ferrets can
ingest small items that can cause blockages. Remember this characteristic
about your ferret when you ferret-proof your home (see Chapter 6). Plus,
food that your fuzzy stashes can spoil or mold.

The zig-zag
Have you ever heard the saying a straight line for a ferret includes six zigs
and seven zags? When zig-zagging, your ferret isn’t trying to evade a pursuer,
though that would be an excellent guess. Your ferret has inherited a unique
hunting technique from her wild polecat relatives. Scanning the ground from
side to side as she moves forward allows your ferret to cover more surface
area and increases the odds of catching or unearthing a meal — or a dirty
sock, in the case of your domesticated ferret.
Butt scooting
A skid mark here, a skid mark there: The unmistakable signs of the infamous
ferret butt scoot! Ferrets and polecats may drag their butts across the yard or
floor after going to the bathroom. This is your ferret’s way of saying, “I was

Blame the ferret!
In several plays written thousands of years ago,
Aristophanes made fun of political opponents
by calling them ferrets. He would imply that they
stole public trust and funds in the same way fer-
rets stole bits of meat and shiny objects. The
wording of these quotes may differ, and the
animal mentioned by Aristophanes has been
called a cat, marten, ferret, polecat, and house
ferret. Thanks to Bob Church for providing these
gems!
 In The Acharnians (425 BCE): “Happy he
who shall be your possessor and embrace
you so firmly at dawn, that you fart like a
house ferret.” Note: Reference to poofing.
 In Wasps (422 BCE): “But to-day men-at-
arms are placed at every outlet to watch
me, and two of them are lying in wait for me
at this very door armed with spits, just as
folks lie in wait for a house ferret that has
stolen a piece of meat.” Note: Reference to
stealing meat.
 In Peace (421 BCE): “Let someone bring me
the thrush and those two chaffinches; there
were also some curds and four pieces of
hare, unless the house ferret stole them last
evening, for I know not what the infernal
noise was that I heard in the house.” Note:
Reference to stealing meat.
 In The Thesmophoriazusae (411 BCE): “And
how we give meats to our pimps at the feast
of the Apaturia and then accuse the house
ferret . . .” Note: Reference to giving meat
(treasure) to others and blaming the ferret
for stealing it.
 In Plutus (380 BCE): “Quick she drew back
her hand, slipped down into the bed with
her head beneath the coverlets and never
moved again; only she let flee a fart in her
fear which stank worse than a house
ferret.” Note: Reference to poofing.

here!” Not all butt scoots leave visual evidence, but they all leave olfactory
trails that tell other ferrets and animals that the area has been or is currently
occupied by your fuzzy.
Coveting thy hidey-hole
Hidey-holes go hand in hand with ferrets, and the good spots are highly cov-
eted if you have more than one fuzzy. In the wild, polecats use the burrows of
other animals to nest in, but if none are readily available, they’ll dig their own
holes in tree root balls. They don’t seem to stay in one spot for long; they’ll
pack up and move frequently. Domesticated ferrets also take advantage of
hidey-holes when they find them. They’ll hole up in them to sleep or rest and
occasionally have to defend them from other ferrets. When your ferret can’t
find hidey-holes, she’ll create them herself by digging or burrowing into 
mattresses, couches, or even your underwear drawer.
Scoping out boundaries
Wild polecats spend a lot of time patrolling their territories in the wild, and a
good amount of time is spent along the boundaries. Boundary patrols are
conducted so that intruding polecats know the territory is currently occu-
pied and they shouldn’t enter. This reduces the amount of fights and
decreases the chances of injury.
Domesticated ferrets inherited this territorial patrolling behavior. When first
released from her cage or after a long nap, your ferret will first patrol the area
before she starts to play. Along the walls, behind couches and curtains; she’s
simply retracing her territory and looking for intruders. Although you cer-
tainly hope she’ll aim for the litter box, pooping along the edges, in corners,
and even in doorways where intruders may enter is your ferret’s way of
putting up a fence, so to speak.

Putting Your Ferret through Basic
Training: Easy as 1-2-3?
In This Chapter

L
ike a dog, a fuzzy doesn’t come preprogrammed for use. You teach a dog
how to sit, come, and heel; you must teach a fuzzy certain things, too —
like how to mind his manners, use the litter box, and tolerate a harness and
leash. These are basics of ferret life that every furkid should know. Some fer-
rets take to basic training quite quickly, but others need constant reminders
of who’s the boss. Teaching the basics of good manners means putting on
your professor’s hat and doing a little home-schooling with your new fuzzy. If
your new ferret is an adult, chances are someone else has already home-
schooled him, so you just need to keep him current on his skills.
As with any animal, including humans, patience and consistency are the keys
to training success. You’ll see what I mean when you bring your furball home.
But just remember that the patience and effort are well worth it, because
nothing can compare to the joy a socialized and greatly loved ferret will bring
into your household. In this chapter, I cover the three basic training areas
that require your effort, patience, and consistency: eliminating biting, bath-
room training, and harness and leash socialization.
Just Say NO to Biting
Ferrets are similar to kittens and puppies in that they need to be trained not
to bite. If you watch a human toddler closely, you’ll be amazed at all the stuff
that ends up in the kid’s mouth. Chewing is how babies, human and animal,
explore their environments and ease the pain of teething. Eventually the
toothaches go away, but the nipping lingers on. Although the urge to nip
lessens with age, an untrained adult ferret can be dangerously bold and

aggressive with his chompers. Your job is to let your fuzzy know while he’s
young what is and isn’t acceptable behavior. If you begin proper socialization
and training when your ferret is young, you decrease the chances of him
biting as an adult. (In this section, I talk about training baby ferrets, not
adults that haven’t been properly socialized. I cover getting help for the diffi-
cult adult carpet shark in Chapter 20.)
Sometimes, training a youngster not to nip takes a lot of time and patience.
The key to being successful is consistency. It can seem so cute at times to get
the little guy all riled up and allow him to play-bite your hand. But you can’t
let your ferret bite during play and expect him to know that it isn’t acceptable
at other times and with other people. He won’t understand that nipping is
okay only when you’re in the mood, so don’t confuse him. Teach him one
thing — not to bite — and stick to your guns. Believe me, if you have multiple
fuzzies, the other ferrets will tell the kit just how far he can go with them. You
should do the same!
It’s important that you pay special attention to the do’s and don’ts of nip-
training your ferret. The following list presents some suggestions to help 
with training your fuzzy not to bite:
 Provide plenty of hard chew toys.
 Use a toy to wrestle with him rather than your hand.
 Mist a bitter pet spray on your hand when playing with him.
After he gets a taste, he probably won’t come back for seconds. Bitter
spray is a nasty-tasting but harmless substance used to deter chewing in
all kinds of pets. The substance is clear, too, and won’t harm your furni-
ture or fingers. Most pet stores carry it.
 Correct a nip immediately by scruffing the kit and very loudly saying
“No” or “No bite.”
Scruffing is when you firmly grasp the loose skin on the back of the
ferret’s neck with your thumb and fingers and dangle the ferret. Hissing
(not screaming) loudly at the ferret after you say “No” is also very effec-
tive. Hissing is the tool a Mother Ferret or other ferrets would use to dis-
cipline kits. You can also lay (not tap) your finger gently across his nose
after you scruff, say “No bite,” and then hiss at him.
 If you’re holding the kit when he nips, don’t reward him by giving
him his freedom (in other words, don’t put him down to roam free).
Instead, place him in jail (cage him).
 Don’t ever hit your ferret in an attempt to discipline or train him,
because aggression leads to aggression.
Your fuzzy may also think that you’re encouraging him to play harder.
Hitting is an ineffective technique and frequently leads to bigger 
behavioral problems.

This Way to the Bathroom
If you read the other chapters of this book, you’ll notice that I talk rather fre-
quently about the ferret’s bodily functions; that’s because ferrets seem to
poop about every 15 minutes or so while they’re awake. And most ferret
people spend more time telling animated stories and jokes about their
fuzzies’ notorious bathroom habits than they do cleaning up after their kids.
(Okay, I’ll admit it, that’s a little weird.)
Mother Fuzzy, if given the chance, will teach her kits to use the litter box.
However, because many kits are delivered to new homes or halfway houses
before mom gets the chance to teach them, the new human caretakers must
do this dirty deed.
It’s pretty simple to train a furkid that the litter box is his designated toilet.
Although teaching ferrets the purpose of the litter box is pretty easy, getting
them to use it consistently is a crapshoot. Ferrets, unfortunately, don’t have
the greatest toilet habits. The following tips should help (for more on effec-
tive litter boxes and incorporating them into your ferret’s kingdom, check out
Chapter 5):
 Keep your fuzzy’s litter box in the corner of his cage. A corner area is a
magnet for a fuzzy butt. Ferrets prefer to back into a loading zone and
unload.
 Limit baby ferrets — or any ferret that’s just learning to use a litter
box — to smaller cages and play areas until the bathroom concept has
sunk in. Move your ferret to a larger cage only after he’s potty trained,
and add litter boxes to the higher levels if needed (see Chapter 5 for
more on ferret cages).
As you expand your ferret’s out-of-cage play area, increase the number
of litter boxes you put in it. If a litter box is close by, your ferret will be
more likely to use it. If you pay attention, your fuzzy will show you which
corners are the best spots for litter boxes. Frequently pick him up and
place him in a box until he goes. If he refuses, let him play for a few min-
utes and then repeat the process.
 If your ferret is tiny (or ill), make sure his litter box has a low side or
is small enough for him to climb in.
 When you wake your ferret for playtime, place him immediately in
his litter box and wait until he does his duty. When he does, you can
let him come out. Don’t be fooled by a faux poo; make sure he’s really
gone to the bathroom.
 Until your fuzzy starts going consistently in his litter box, keep a little
poo in the box as a reminder that the litter box is a toilet.
315
Chapter 19: Putting Your Ferret through Basic Training: Easy as 1-2-3?

 If you catch your ferret straying from the plan (by backing into a
corner, for instance), pick him up, firmly say “No,” and then place
him in the litter box until he goes.
 Always praise your ferret for a job well done. Use verbal schmoozing
as well as petting.
Now that you have some tips in your potty-training arsenal for getting your
fuzzy to use his box, you need to know the don’ts of bathroom training. The
following list presents these don’ts:
 Never hit your fuzzy for having an accident. Just be thankful he isn’t a
Great Dane!
 Never rub a ferret’s nose in his waste when he has an accident. This
practice is abusive and serves no purpose. (It doesn’t work with dogs,
either.)
 Don’t offer your fuzzy food rewards for going in his box. You’ll just
teach him how to fake a poopy to get a treat.
I have some ferrets that back up to the edge of the litter box and then poop
outside on the tile. This just proves that even when you do everything right,
things can still go wrong. Go figure!
Harnessing Your Fuzzy for a Walk
Fuzzies are explorers by nature and can cover a lot of ground in only a few
seconds. A fuzzy loves to wander around the backyard and explore outside,
and it’s nice for a ferret and his human to explore the outside world together.
Unfortunately, without the proper restraint, it won’t take your fuzzy long to
get beyond your safe reach and into trouble. If you want to take your ferret
outside to play, I advise you to always keep him leashed.
And nothing goes better with a ferret’s leash than a harness for his long, slen-
der body. I suggest that you choose an H-shaped harness designed specifi-
cally for ferrets (see Chapter 5). A tight collar (but not too tight) works, as
long as you keep a close eye on your traveling ferret and he doesn’t attempt
to escape. I personally don’t like using collars. A tug on a collar can send the
startled ferret into a frantic roll to get away from you. Also, a struggling fuzzy
can often slip right out of a collar and scurry for freedom. I prefer harnesses
because ferrets need less time to adjust to these new articles of clothing, and
they’re much more secure and safe. 
As an extra precaution, you should consider fastening an identification tag to
your fuzzy’s harness in case he does escape. Some people even attach bells
to the harness to keep track of the fuzzy’s whereabouts. 
316
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

The sections that follow show you how to familiarize your fuzzy with his 
harness and give you basic rules to follow when taking your fuzzy to the 
great outdoors to explore.
Getting fuzzy used to a harness
Before you take your ferret outside, get him accustomed to his harness and
leash inside. Most ferrets struggle when you first put on the harness or collar,
but after awhile, most go about their business of exploring. Once in a while,
though, I come across a rebellious carpet shark who takes more time to get
used to the new constraint.
Start off slowly by following these simple steps:
1. Get your ferret used to wearing his harness in the house while you
supervise — but without a leash attached.
His harness should be just tight enough to prevent him from slipping out
during a struggle.
2. When he begins to forget about his new piece of clothing, add the
leash and walk him around the house.
3. When he seems to accept his limited freedom, you can move to the
outside world.
I like to have my ferrets get all their struggling out inside the house, just in
case. There’s nothing like the panic that races through you as you’re trying to
catch a loose ferret outside. 
Wah-lah. There’s little more to this training than just harnessing your little
guy. Some ferrets may need time to get used to having dead weight holding
them back, but I’ve never seen a ferret revolt the way a puppy sometimes
does. Ferrets don’t heel or walk peacefully by your side like a pooch. The 
harness-and-leash method is merely a convenient way to tow you behind
them as they go on their merry little ways.
A lot of people keep harnesses or tightly fitted collars on their ferrets all the
time. Perhaps they leave the harnesses or collars on due to frustration or
anxiety about having to put them back on later. I think this is a dangerous
practice. Ferrets can and will get into everything and like to squeeze into
small places. I advise you to never leave a collar or harness on your ferret
while he’s unsupervised, because it’s very easy for him to get caught up on
something and either get stuck or strangle himself, even in his own cage. If
you have to battle to get the harness on, simply practice more often.
317
Chapter 19: Putting Your Ferret through Basic Training: Easy as 1-2-3?

Following basic rules when 
you’re out and about
The following list presents some basic rules for safety and sanity when you’re
outside with your fuzzy:
 Never tie your tethered ferret to something and leave him unsuper-
vised. Besides being an easy target for predators, your ferret will get
bored and frustrated and do everything he can to escape, and he may
just succeed.
 Never let your leashed ferret wander into shrubbery. He can become
entangled in the branches, and it will be difficult for you to rescue him.
Worst-case scenario, he can get stuck and wiggle his way out of his 
harness or collar.
 Never use stretchy collars. This collar variety is easy to pull off.
 Never use plastic collars or harnesses. Your fuzzy will be tempted to
chew on them and swallow the pieces. Even if the ferret wearing the
collar doesn’t chew it, a visiting playmate may.
 Never ignore the temperature. You wouldn’t walk your fuzzy across hot
coals, so don’t walk him on hot pavement. The fuzzy’s paw-paws are
very sensitive, you know. Likewise, those of us who’ve hopped franti-
cally across a sandy beach know how brutally hot sand can get, and
they don’t make sandals for carpet sharks! Walking on snow is okay as
long as your ferret isn’t in it for too long.

Dealing with the Behaviorally
Challenged Ferret
In This Chapter
 Knowing the reasoning behind your ferret’s aggression
 Handling and taming the biting fuzzbutt
S
ome potential ferret owners, even after reading many books and maga-
zines on ferrets, still aren’t prepared for the endless behavioral possibili-
ties they may face. You really can’t know what all to expect until you’ve
actually walked several miles with fuzzies attached to your shoes. It isn’t just
the newcomers who get all the surprises; many experienced fuzzy owners
encounter unexpected problems after years of perfect fuzzdom. And consider
this: It may be the ferret owner who’s the problem and not the poor fuzzy.
This chapter is mostly about problem-solving and preparing you as much as
possible for the issues you may face. It deals with some of the reasons people
give up their ferrets — in other words, it deals with the behaviorally chal-
lenged carpet sharks. I discuss the biters, the misunderstood ferrets of the
world, and the aggressive beasts. You get the information needed to under-
stand these fuzzies and reform them into acceptable members of the family.
Understanding Your Dracula 
in Fuzzy’s Clothing
Once in a blue moon, a person will adopt a ferret that’s just plain mean — in
other words, she’s a biter — and nothing much can be done about it. This is
common in all pets, and ferrets are no exception. Most ferrets are loving and
playful family members. Out of all the ferrets that have passed through my
shelter or have remained as permanent residents, I’ve only encountered four
severe biters. My experience has been that a lovable pooch is still far more
dangerous than the typical fuzzy. But problem biters do exist, and you may
adopt one someday.

The good news is that there’s hope for the biting ferret. Most aggressive fer-
rets can be turned into gentle critters if their owners are willing to work on
their relationships. If you’re serious about being a fuzzy human, dumping a
problem carpet shark at the nearest shelter should be your absolute last
resort. This section is for the ferret lover who’s willing to work to keep the
ferret a part of the family.
Ferrets can bite for many reasons. Although you may not have all the colorful
information about your fuzzy’s personal history, you may be able to put the
pieces together just by being a good observer. It may mean learning how to
deactivate the bomb before it goes off, or it may mean taking time to con-
vince your fuzzy that not all humans are evil. Usually, it’s the latter (humans
are the root of most biting evils).
Not all ferret bites should be considered attacks. In fact, most aren’t. Ferrets
often have a good reason to bite; biting is sometimes the only way a ferret
can communicate her needs or wishes. For example, a fuzzy can’t reach up
and smack you on the back of the head to say, “Tag, you’re it.” However, a 
nip on the ankle may be just as effective. Tag, by the way, is a favorite ferret
game.
After you identify why your ferret is biting, you can address the situation
appropriately. The following sections take a look at the most common rea-
sons ferrets bite. (The later section “Socializing Your Biting Beast” explains
what you can do to correct the problem, and Chapter 19 deals with training
your ferret not to bite.)
You must recognize the difference between playful biting and aggressive
biting and try to correct both. An aggressive biter may bite you and hold on,
or she may bite so hard that she draws blood. The pain caused by an aggres-
sive biter is unmistakable. Playful bites include mouthing, light nips, and
even “nip and runs.” Although playful bites cause little to no discomfort, they
may cause future problems.
I’m having growing pains
Baby ferrets are natural nippers. They are, by nature, animals that face preda-
tion pressure. Young kits may react to startles by biting, simply as an instinc-
tive reaction. Nothing is wrong with them; they just tend to react instinctively.
And like all mammals, they explore the world with their mouths. And they
have teething pains that can be severe at times, and gnawing on the closest
available thing — your arm or a chew toy — helps to alleviate the pain. If your
biting furball is a kit, I tend to think the situation really doesn’t fall into the
classification of “problem” — yet (see the following section).
320
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

Nobody told me not to bite
Many owners fail to nip-train their ferrets at an early age, when training is so
crucial. The kit stage is the time when members of the ferret litter teach each
other their biting limits. It is how a large male kit can play with a small female
and not harm her. The rule ferrets learn is to never play harder than another
ferret. An untrained fuzzy may be the owner’s fault, the fault of a previous
caretaker, or even the fault of a pet shop that failed to handle the cute babies
on display. Perhaps the fuzzy you’ve adopted hasn’t had limits set for her.
Unfortunately, innocent kit nippers turn into bold biters if you don’t stop the
nipping early.
Often, people dump their nipping ferrets because they just don’t know how
to set limits and be the human bosses. The reason is due purely to frustration
and lack of education. Chapter 19 covers how to nip-train a fuzzy. Educate
yourself and don’t give up on your little furball!
I’m in pain, darn it!
Your ferret has limited ability to say “Hey, my belly aches” or “I have these
nasty bugs in my darn ears,” so she may bite instead. Your biting furball may
be suffering from a treatable condition, such as a severe ear-mite infestation,
or a more chronic disease, like adrenal disease. There are many, many med-
ical conditions that can lead a ferret to bite.
Be a good human and be mindful of sudden changes in behavior. Many times
she just isn’t feeling well and needs your help. If the biting seems out of char-
acter, take your biter to the vet (warn the vet in advance about the aggres-
sion) for a complete physical. Rule out any illness or injury that may be
causing your ferret to lash out in pain.
I’m a manly or bully ferret
Unneutered male ferrets can (and probably will) be more aggressive than
their altered counterparts. As with some teenage boys, it’s the male ferret’s
hormonal duty to dominate whomever he can. Usually, an unneutered ferret
chooses other male ferrets to bully. Female ferrets can also be targets of this
type of male aggression. Sometimes, he’ll bully the human who unknowingly
tests his ferret manlihood. If you want to fix the aggression problem for this
type of ferret, neuter that boy!
321
Chapter 20: Dealing with the Behaviorally Challenged Ferret

I’m facing a lot of change right now
Change, whether good or bad, is scary. Imagine this: Some giant picks you up,
rips you out of your house, and plops you down in the middle of who knows
where. Strangers are poking at you. Everything smells and looks funny. Some
big, wet nose is sniffing at you and blowing snot on you. The new noises are
enough to make your head explode. If you had a tail, it would be puffed out
like a bottlebrush! You don’t know whether to poop, run away, or bite. Heck,
for all you know, you’re in for the nightmare of your life.
A ferret in a strange situation may act scared and confused. Whether she’s
with a human she’s loved and trusted for years or in the care of a brand new
human, she doesn’t know what to expect. When a ferret is under this much
stress, she may bite. Give this ferret time to acclimate to big changes before
rushing in and forcing her to bond with you. It may take hours, days, or
weeks. But go slowly and let her explore new surroundings or new people.
Biting always worked before!
If your ferret was once under the care of another human (or perhaps you
were the culprit), it’s possible that she may have been trained to bite inadver-
tently. I don’t mean “Caution: Guard Ferret on Premises!” I’m talking about a
weenie human who gave the ferret her way every time she nipped. For
instance, if the person picked up the fuzzy and she nipped, the person put
her down and gave her freedom. Or perhaps when the ferret bit, the human
thought that she must be hungry, so the person rewarded her with food. In
other words, the ferret was training the human.
Never positively reinforce a biting ferret. You shouldn’t view biting as a cute
way to tell you something.
I’m still fighting back
The main cause of a biting ferret is mistrust of humans. Humans can be pretty
nasty animals. Some humans react violently or impulsively to stuff they don’t
understand; others are just jerks who thrive on being cruel. Unfortunately,
animals are frequent victims of human abuse. In these cases, you can’t blame
a rescued fuzzy for remaining aggressive. Abused fuzzies learn several things
during their abuse: 1) Attack or be attacked. 2) Hands equal hitting, feet
equal kicking, and humans equal pain. 3) Every ferret for herself.
Working with an abused ferret takes extra time and patience. If you’ve ever
been badly hurt by someone, physically or emotionally, you know how long it
can take to trust again. Head to the following section to start the road to
recovery with your scared fuzzy.
322
Part V: Ferret Psychology 101: Behavior and Training 

Some other reasons for my biting
Some ferrets react aggressively to particular noises, smells, or objects. My
ferret Sybil (appropriately named), for example, came to my shelter with two
other nutcases, Buster and Fidget. Sybil reacts aggressively when the dogs
start barking, no matter where they are or why they’re barking. How does she
react? She runs up and bites me when they bark. Many ferrets react similarly
to other stimuli, such as
 New smells (especially on the hands or clothes)
 The ruffling of newspapers
 Vacuum cleaners
 Brooms
 Loud music
The list goes on. This is called displaced aggression, and there isn’t always a
reason why it happens. Some ferrets just get extra freaky around freaky
people. This type of carpet shark may chase a timid person around the room
and nip at his ankles. Most of these quirky ferrets are otherwise lovable and
sweet, as most fuzzies are. The bottom line: If you’re smart enough to identify
the trigger, you should be smart enough not to trigger your fuzzy when she’s
out of her cage. (Oh, and by the way, most ferrets do have foot fetishes!)
Socializing Your Biting Beast
Not many fuzzies are just determined to be aggressive no matter what their
owners do. A hopeless fuzzy case is a rarity. If you think you have an eccen-
tric head case that you just can’t handle, I suggest that you just haven’t found
the right approach or haven’t been consistent with your technique. Your
fuzzbutt may even be suffering from a combination of neuroses or a serious
medical condition. Every ferret is a unique individual and responds differ-
ently to different methods of resocialization. Your job as your fuzzy’s human
is to find the best combination of love and gentle discipline.
In the following sections, you find out the best way to handle the biting ferret,
as well as what to do if you should find yourself with a ferret hanging off your
finger. With patience and consistency, using the tips here, you’ll be able to
turn your Dracula into a charmer in no time.
323
Chapter 20: Dealing with the Behaviorally Challenged Ferret

Getting a grip
I find that the best way to handle an aggressive carpet shark is to firmly hold
the upper part of her body from underneath, but with more control over her
head — the grip method. You may have to distract her a little to seize her this
way, but it allows you to hold her so she can’t twist her head around to latch
onto some vital part of your body. Simply follow these steps:
1. Grab your fuzzy by the scruff of the neck.
2. Take your free hand and hold her from underneath, just above her
chest.
3. Wrap your fingers around the fuzzy’s neck.
A paw may also go in between your fingers.
4. When you’re confident that you have the ferret safely but firmly in
your grip, you can release the scruff.
5. Now you can use that free hand to smother her with gentle petting.
This is a great handling method and doesn’t require gloves (see the upcom-
ing sidebar). And it usually works, too.
Getting unstuck
If a ferret bites you and doesn’t want to let go (an uncommon behavior), you
can use some techniques to get her off. Unless you’re an experienced ferret
handler, though, you’ll probably be too busy panicking and overreacting to

Norm and his magic touch with aggressive ferrets
Norm Stilson of the Greater Chicago Ferret
Association uses the same method to socialize
all biting ferrets, and he has a tremendous suc-
cess rate. He admits that his reconditioning
process can take anywhere from a few weeks
to a couple years. It depends largely on the
severity of the ferret’s mistrust of humans (in
other words, how big of a jerk her previous
human was) and how much time Norm has to
work with the biter. Still, I’ve seen him in action,
transforming the most hopeless biters into
snuggly, happy fuzzbutts.
Norm uses the upper body grip, which I
describe in the “Getting a grip” section, and
spends a lot of time talking gently to the ferret.
He uses his free hand to stroke the fur on top of
the fuzzy’s head and neck at the same time. He
cuddles the fuzzy up against him (keeping con-
trol of the ferret’s head) and even kisses the top
of the fuzzy’s head. Norm’s version of the
method, in my opinion, is the best.

think about these techniques logically. Most people just try to fling the ferret
from whichever body part she’s latched onto.
With a little preparation and knowledge, you may be able to keep your wits
about you in a latching situation and get unstuck. Some of the following tips
may come in handy:
 Place a tiny amount of bitter solution into the corner of the ferret’s
mouth (use a cotton swab or small controlled spray). You can find this
bitter solution at most pet stores. While she’s ptooeying out the taste,
your finger will be ptooeyed out along with it.
Don’t spray bitter solution directly into the ferret’s face. Ever. Doing so
is painful and cruel, and the fuzzy’s next bite will be justified.
 Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and touch the corner of the ferret’s
mouth. This method usually works wonders!
 Ask a helping hand to gently squeeze the carpet shark’s jaws open and
aid you in prying her off, one tooth at a time.
A real fear biter can “jump bite,” moving from your skin to the helper’s
skin. Be extra cautious. (See the earlier section “Understanding Your
Dracula in Fuzzy’s Clothing” for more on the reasons for biting.)
 Have a helper thread a wooden chopstick behind the skin under attack.
A gentle yet forceful twisting motion can loosen the bite grip just enough
to allow for an escape without harming the ferret.
 Drip some Ferretone or olive oil over the tip of the ferret’s nose. The
ferret should automatically start licking the treat, releasing you in the
process.
325
Chapter 20: Dealing with the Behaviorally Challenged Ferret
A gripping question: Gloves or hands?
Some people think that thick gloves, made of
leather, are great for working to tame the
aggressive ferret. Gloves can help protect your
hands from the serious ouchies an aggressive
biter can inflict. Using gloves allows you to
handle the fuzzy confidently and without fear if
you’re serious about taming her. If you’re skit-
tish around your aggressive ferret to begin with,
this option may be the way to go. Another option
is a fillet glove, which is thinner and has metal
armor that prevents bites from getting through.
You can find these gloves at sporting goods
stores.
Although many people advocate using gloves to
tame the biter, I believe that doing so may actu-
ally defeat the purpose. I think fuzzies find the
feel of a gentle but firm human paw a little more
soothing than the feel of a stiff, groping glove.
Being held with a glove may feel a bit more like
being manhandled, which may be why your fur-
ball is so ticked off in the first place. I’ve never
used gloves. They’re too bulky on my tiny hands,
and I can’t seem to hold a fuzzy comfortably.
Also, I never want to give a ferret the impres-
sion that my skin is tough and can withstand
such torture!

Although I often stress the importance of not rewarding biting with
treats, giving a reward is justified during an extreme, prolonged bite. The
object is to get unhooked without causing further trauma to you or the
frightened ferret.
 Find a cold body of water — such as water in a toilet, bathtub, or sink —
and submerge her until her desire to breathe overtakes her desire to
mangle you.
This is a last-resort solution. Don’t flush her down the toilet or drown
her in the process. Bite wounds heal. Death is irreversible, and guilt
haunts for a long time. You can also use cold running water from a
faucet.
Don’t try to get your ferret to release by pulling her or jerking her away. In
other words, don’t try to send her for a flying lesson. Doing so only causes
more damage, and you’ll feel really stupid if you further injure yourself or
your fuzzy when you have many better options.
The main thing to remember when being bitten is don’t panic. Panicking usu-
ally makes the situation worse. If you know you’re dealing with an aggressive
ferret, you can opt not to handle her unless someone else is around to come
to your rescue.
Taming the critter
Depending on your ferret’s personality and her past life experiences, she may
or may not respond to certain methods of reconditioning. Some fuzzies learn
quickly that humans can be trustworthy and can make great playmates.
Others need quite a bit more time to come to this conclusion. This section

“I will probably bite you even harder if you . . .”
If you opt for one of the following techniques to
get your fuzzy to unlatch from a bite, you’ll prob-
ably make the problem worse:
 Mist a bitter spray or another deterrent in
your fuzzy’s face
 Bite her back on the ear or head (some
people actually do this)
 Flick her on the nose or head when she
bites
 Hit her or throw her across the room
 Isolate her from the world for long periods
of time

presents some ideas that may or may not work for taming your biting ferret.
Unfortunately, some may even make matters worse, but it may only be tem-
porary. Don’t give up on a tactic right away just because it doesn’t work the
first time. Winning over a biter takes patience and consistency. If, however,
the biting gets more severe and more frequent after much patience and con-
sistency, you probably should try a new tactic.
This list gives you some of the more obvious solutions you can try:
 If your companion biter is an unaltered male, neuter him.
 Rule out medical reasons for biting through a veterinary exam and get
veterinary care for any illnesses or injuries.
 If you know the biting trigger, such as barking dogs, don’t subject your
ferret to the trigger.
 If your fuzzy is visually or hearing impaired (or very young), take extra
care not to startle her when handling her.
 Make sure that your ferret is well fed and given a proper diet.
 Spend more quality time with your ferret instead of keeping her cooped
up in the cage for days on end.
And here are some more creative ideas; you can use these in combination
with the previous solutions and with each other:
 Put a bitter spray, such as Bitter Apple (the spray works but the cream
is better), on your hands so a bite doesn’t taste as good.
 Screech, growl, hiss, or loudly yell “Ouch!” or “No!” when the ferret bites
(use simple words, not sentences). Some people do a quick, firm shake
while verbally reprimanding the biter. Many ferrets see this as a sign
that biting definitely isn’t a good thing to do.
Some ferrets may bite harder if a verbal reprimand is accompanied by a
scruff, especially if you include a firm shake. This is a definite individual
thing.
Another method is to tell her, “I’m in charge, darn it!” and place her sub-
missively on her back with a scruff. Hold her firmly in that position high
up on her body to keep control of her head. After a few minutes, give her
a timeout in her cage.
 Sentence the ferret to short-term (no longer than 30 minute) jail time by
placing her in a small carrier for biting. A fuzzy should always get a time-
out immediately after biting.
327
Chapter 20: Dealing with the Behaviorally Challenged Ferret

Timeouts are important for many forms of ferret discipline but should
be used with care. Some people believe that an immediate timeout after
biting is a reward to a ferret that wants to be left alone anyway. So, if you
can, try to physically hold the fuzzy for several minutes after the bite
occurs before you put her away for a timeout (see the section “Getting a
grip”). However, if you’re too angry to be rational or too busy cleaning
up your wounds, you should put away the fuzzy immediately. If these
timeouts don’t seem to work, try the “I’m gonna hold you anyway”
method to see if this form of dominance works better. And get your
tetanus shot updated!
 If your fuzzy currently has no playmate, try introducing a fuzzy friend so
that she’ll have someone to rough and tumble with. She may be bored to
frustration.
 Immediately substitute a toy for the human body part and allow the
ferret to only bite that.
 Wrap the fuzzy securely in a towel and carry her around like a bundled
baby. Talk to her and stroke the top of her head gently.
Don’t use your ferret’s cage as a timeout place. This can work one of two
ways. It can make the ferret view her cage as a “bad place” where she doesn’t
want to go at any time, or the timeout can be viewed as a reward because the
cage is where the ferret wanted to go in the first place. I think it is better to
have a special, very small timeout cage — a cat-sized carrier would work fine.
Aggression isn’t a training or conditioning tool. In my opinion, aggression
only leads to aggression, whether you’re dealing with a human or a fuzzbutt.
Chances are, what got you to this stage had something to do with a human
who was being a jerk. So, throw away all the tough love and put on your com-
passionate hat. The biting ferret reacts positively only to a firm but consis-
tently nonviolent approach. And don’t forget to always reward your ferret for
acceptable behavior. Ferrets are extremely intelligent and learn according to
how you teach them. Heed what Bob Church, ferret guru and enthusiast,
says: “A gentle hand grows a gentle ferret.”

f you need to read a book about breeding, I must say
that you probably aren’t qualified to breed ferrets at
this point in time. It takes the knowledge of many books,
years of ferret ownership, and a great deal of research 
to even think about breeding carpet sharks. However,
although I certainly don’t advocate the indiscriminate
breeding of ferrets, I do include this part about the basics
of ferret breeding. And I do my best here to talk you out of
bringing more ferrets into this world.
There are thousands of ferrets all awaiting good homes.
Please read this part carefully and consider all the ramifi-
cations of breeding before you actually go through with it.
And even if you don’t want to breed fuzzies, this part helps

B
eing able to breed ferrets responsibly and successfully requires years of
ferret ownership and a great deal of research, among other things.
Unless you meet the ownership requirement and can do the research, I
strongly urge you to have your ferret altered and leave breeding to the
people who know exactly what they’re doing and why they’re doing it.
However, kits are simply adorable. What’s more satisfying than raising a
beautiful, healthy fuzzy? (Maybe giving a good home to an old fuzzy that was
abandoned in a shelter.) Responsible private breeders offer an alternative for
fuzzy people who want kits but don’t want to go to pet shops. Responsible
breeders are more interested in a kit’s well-being than money, thus are more
concerned about weeding out the less-than-desirable fuzzy homes. And pri-
vate breeders get to spend oodles of time sharing their wealth of information
with people who seek them out.
This chapter discusses breeder requirements that many beginner breeders
haven’t thought about. Before you begin breeding ferrets, find out whether
you have what it takes. And, even if you decide that you do, ask yourself
whether you should. Also, I discuss ferret shelters and why they exist,
because every ferret in a shelter was once somebody’s little baby.

What It Takes to Be a 
Responsible Breeder
Breeding ferrets requires way more than just throwing two amorous fuzzies in
a cage and hanging up the “Do Not Disturb” sign. Responsible breeders care-
fully choose their breeding pairs, and they breed for good temperament, good
looks, and conformation. They’re prepared for emergency medical situations
and spend most of their free time caring for moms and kits (baby ferrets).
And responsible breeders don’t just sell their kits to anyone. Money should
be the last thing on a responsible breeder’s mind. The honest truth is that
unless you mass-produce hundreds of kits a year and sell them wholesale to
pet shops, you probably won’t make much money. If you’re lucky, you’ll break
even. A responsible breeder does the work because he or she simply loves
the ferret and wants to put the best ferrets in the best homes.
Alas, I can discuss much more that responsible breeders need to have and
do, and I do so in the following sections.
Deep pockets
A ferret breeder must fork over money for the cost of caring for pregnant jills
(unspayed females) and vulnerable kits (babies). In addition to normal care,
breeders will always have unexpected expenses; have you thought about
emergencies or unplanned situations? Responsible breeders must take the
following costs into consideration:
 Purchasing excellent breeding stock to get started
About 85 to 90 percent of the ferrets sold into the pet trade in the 
United States are altered and descented at weaning and are therefore
unbreedable.
 Proper cages and setups for jills and kits (see Chapter 5 for more on
ferret cages)
 Routine vet care for moms and kits, including supplements and any med-
ication needed
 A first vaccination for kits before they go to their new homes
332
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

 Vet care for complications such as uterine infections and mastitis
(infected and hardened mammary glands)
 Emergency C-sections for jills in trouble
 Humane euthanizing of kits that have severe deformities or the cost of
providing lifelong care for these babies
 Spaying bad moms (see the following section) or retirees — and provid-
ing lifelong care for them if you can’t find good homes
 Providing lifelong care for any kits that you can’t sell
The emotional stake
Breeding isn’t always smooth sailing, with happy births and successful adop-
tions; heartache is involved, and so are many decisions that you’d probably
rather not have to face. Ferret moms, for example, may not be good moms at
all. Kits can die from being cannibalized (eaten by mom) or neglected. It can
be heartbreaking. Hand-rearing a newborn kit is next to impossible, so all you
can do is watch.
Many breeders arrange to have two ferrets give birth within a few days of
each other so that they can serve as foster moms if necessary. This plan
doesn’t always work, though — especially if the litters are large.
Before you decide to breed, ask yourself how you would feel about the follow-
ing, because breeders face these situations at one time or another:
 Having kits die suddenly
 Moms cannibalizing or killing the kits
 Losing kits because a mom fails to nurse or is incapable of nursing
 Losing a mom during a difficult pregnancy or labor
 Getting your hopes dashed when you find out it was a false pregnancy
(which is common in ferrets)
 Worrying about all the kits you help into the world and stressing over
how they’re doing in someone else’s care
 Having kits with severe birth defects euthanized
 Having fuzzies returned to you for one reason or another
333
Chapter 21: Should You Breed Your Ferret? Looking at the Big Picture

Time to care
Breeding ferrets, providing support during and after pregnancies for moms
and kits, and finding perfect homes for your precious babies can be
extremely time-consuming. You’ll probably have to forgo your karate classes
to do the following:
 Search for (and research) a source of quality breeder ferrets, which are
your initial financial and emotional investments.
 Keep diligent records (financial and pedigree).
 Talk to and learn from other responsible breeders.
Responsible breeding isn’t a competition; it’s a shared interest.
 Check your kits’ weights regularly to make sure that they’re gaining
weight, and take the necessary steps to correct problems upon discovery.
 Chauffeur your ferrets to and from the vet.
 Spend time socializing kits and begin training before they go to their new
homes.
Good breeders hang onto kits until they’re at least 8 weeks old.
 Spend an enormous amount of time on the phone talking to potential
buyers and new fuzzy parents. Good breeders should be choosy about
whom they sell their babies to, and they should provide ongoing before-
and after-sales support.
 Take care of kits that owners have brought back to you. A responsible
breeder takes back kits that don’t work out in their homes, which can be
a burden over time.
334
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 
Retiring a breeding myth
Breeding animals isn’t a way to teach a child
about the miracle of life (and death, in many
cases). If you feel your child is missing out in
this area of knowledge, rent a video, buy some
books, or tune in to the Discovery Channel or
Animal Planet. These are great ways to spend
quality time with kids and still teach them the
value and beauty of life. Of course, also explain
to your kids the devastating effects of overpop-
ulation so that they’ll understand why a video
may be far more responsible than the real thing
(see the final section of this chapter for more).

If you think you have what it takes to be a responsible fuzzy breeder, research
the subject a little more. Call your local ferret shelter and put in a few hours of
volunteer work each week. If you don’t have time to do that now, you certainly
won’t have the time to breed ferrets responsibly.
Willingness to find out 
what you don’t know
Responsible breeding means knowing a lot about ferret biology and genetics.
For example, did you know that ferrets are similar to chinchillas in that
breeding certain color variations may cause lethal genes? Additionally, new,
exotic ferret colors being produced may be the result of mutant or recessive
genes. No one knows for sure whether funky-colored ferrets will have more
health problems down the road. How can you know whether you’re creating
one of these tragic situations?
In addition to biology and genetics, you need to know the rules governing the
sale of ferrets. For example, when it comes to selling your kits, did you know
that breeders who wholesale their ferrets (sell to pet shops, for example) are
required to be USDA licensed? (Some breeders also have to be licensed by
their state’s Department of Agriculture; USDA is a separate federal licensing.)
This places even more emphasis on the need to keep good records and main-
tain good husbandry practices. Inspectors can pop in at any reasonable 
time — unannounced — to inspect your facility, animals, and records. Also,
ferret breeders may be required to have additional permits or licenses,
depending on where they live.
Avoiding a Need for More Shelters
If you love ferrets (and presumably you do if you want to breed them), you
don’t want to bolster the need for shelters. Most people have heard at one
time or another the statistics on how many dogs and cats are killed each year
in shelters. The senseless deaths of these once-loved pets number in the mil-
lions. As ferrets gain popularity as companion pets in households, the
number of furballs that wind up in shelters also increases, as does 
the number of deaths of these homeless fuzzies.
335
Chapter 21: Should You Breed Your Ferret? Looking at the Big Picture

Careless breeding by humans is the cause for overpopulation. The population
of fuzzbutts at ferret shelters such as the Greater Chicago Ferret Association
can fluctuate between 60 and 100 ferrets at a time. That’s a lot of displaced
furkids. Many are geriatric fuzzies that no longer fit into the perfect pet mold
their humans have illogically created. These unfortunate souls get dumped
for younger or different pets.
No ferret breeder can guarantee that every one of his or her kits will remain
in permanent, loving homes. Too many people treat animals as property; they
put little thought into getting pets and end up abusing them, neglecting them,
selling them to the highest bidders, or giving them away to whoever shows
up first. Some people even dump fuzzies into the wild to futilely fend for
themselves, or they abandon them at shelters where their futures are
unknown. This revolving-door syndrome gets passed on by example to chil-
dren. It’s morally and ethically wrong to treat any life with such disregard;
this cycle needs to be stopped.
You can help stop this cycle by thinking long and hard about whether you
should breed ferrets at all. If you can’t meet the points listed previously in
“What It Takes to Be a Responsible Breeder,” you’ll for sure be adding to the
vicious cycle. But even responsible breeders can’t guarantee they won’t be a
part of the cycle, because there are no guarantees on where the ferrets end
up. Although it’s true that overpopulation is a problem and breeding needs to
be curtailed, the true problem lies with a human mentality that pets are dis-
posable and the job of the shelter is to take in the unwanteds. The cycle
stops with education and a change in mentality.

E
ven if you’ve identified the perfect pair of fuzzies to breed (see Chapter 21),
getting them to cooperate may be difficult. We humans tend to think that
guys, no matter what species, have one thing on the brain and are always in 
the mood; the male ferret, or hob, however, has long bouts of “Not now, dear — 
I have a headache” syndrome.
Headaches aside, ferret courtship and mating often are primitively brutal and
unromantic. After the deed is done and the male scoots off to put another
notch in his chew toy, the female, or jill, needs some extra-special attention.
Being the good human that you are, your job is to see that her needs are ade-
quately met. This means more than just running out for a late-night pickle
purchase; you must provide a whole lot of tender, loving care, supply a good
place for her to hunker down, and fill her belly with extra-good stuff.
In addition to addressing the needs of a pregnant ferret, this chapter gives
you an overview of the ferret’s reproductive system and mating habits. We
give a lot of emphasis to the do’s and don’ts of breeding ferrets. This chapter
also discusses the actual birth of the kits. Because the mortality rate in new-
born fuzzy kits is high, I outline the basic things that can go wrong and
explain what you may be able to do to help. This is a particularly important
chapter to pay attention to if you’re considering bringing more fuzzbutts into
the world. It’s also great for people — especially shelter workers — who
unexpectedly find themselves with pregnant ferrets on their hands.

This chapter isn’t meant to be a step-by-step guide to breeding fuzzies. The
breeding process takes years to learn. Consider the information here as back-
ground basics and an overview of typical things people encounter when
breeding ferrets. If anything, this chapter is meant to further convince you to
leave fuzzy breeding to experienced and responsible experts. 
Fine-Tuning the Organs
Hormones and sexual maturity can cause wondrous changes in the appear-
ance, behavior, and habits of our lovable ferrets. These changes occur over
time as the body develops and peak during the mating seasons, or ruts, when
sexual maturity has been reached.
You need to know how ferrets develop and what changes you can expect to
encounter in unaltered ferrets if you’re considering breeding them. This brief
section gives you an overview of the ferret’s reproductive system and mating
habits.
The boy (hob)
The male ferret’s testicles begin to mature approximately six weeks after his
birth. Full maturity takes close to three months. You can tell when a hob is
beginning that confusing time of puberty because his testicles begin to
increase in size, mainly due to the increase in the male hormone testos-
terone. Also testicle size can change according to the photoperiod. Ferrets
are tuned into the photoperiod to determine times of fertility. The testicle
size is small and may appear “immature” in the non-breeding season (winter)
and increase greatly in size in the breeding season — spring to fall. The
increase in testosterone also causes the ferret to notice the girls a little more.
Boy ferrets that are ready to breed wear a discolored, yellowish undercoat,
caused by an increase in oil production in the skin glands. They’re at their
smelliest during this time.
Mature males may tease the girls (only because they like them) and grab the
backs of their necks to show them how much they care. Like with the overac-
tive male dog, behaviors such as pelvic thrusting and mounting various
objects occur frequently. They may also begin to stash ferret magazines
under their snooze sacks and spend way too much time on the phone! After
breeding season, however, the male ferret returns to being just one of the
stinky guys.
338
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

If you haven’t already figured it out, unaltered male ferrets are quite the
smelly boys. They can be extremely aggressive toward other males and even
their humans — especially when they’re out to capture a female’s heart. For
this reason, unaltered boys don’t usually make good pets when they’re in
breeding season.
The girl (jill)
Unaltered female ferrets become sexually mature at about 6 months of age
under normal lighting conditions. The onset of estrus (the heat period) is
closely associated with the increase in daylight during the normal seasonal
change. Females that are exposed to shorter light days are late bloomers that
reach sexual maturity as late as 12 months of age.
A female in estrus is easy to identify. Her pink vulva swells due to an increase
in the female hormone estrogen (see Figure 22-1). You may see a clear or
slightly discolored discharge. 
The female in heat may get crabby and sleep less (I refer to it as PMS, or Pre-
Mustelid Syndrome). But unlike female humans, the ferret in estrus usually
cuts back on her food intake. Some other stuff is going on inside her body,
too. The lining of her uterus begins to swell, and follicles containing eggs
develop in the ovaries. Then she just sits back and waits for her dream ferret
to come by and sweep her off her fuzzy feet.
Making a love connection: 
Enter Neanderthal ferret
A female ferret should be bred about two weeks after the swelling of her
vulva becomes noticeable (see the previous section). Typically, you should
bring the female to the male’s condo for the rendezvous. I recommend that
you stay close to chaperone the first date to be sure the chemistry isn’t
overly explosive. Expect a lot of noise and commotion. The female may even
adamantly reject the hob’s advances. If he persists, she usually wins after a
horrific fight ensues.
Many bree–ders recommend that you keep the breeding pair together for two
to three days. Any longer than that and the male quickly gets on the female’s
nerves, causing arguments (and an occasional throwing of dishes). A lack of
tolerance on the female’s part often indicates that she has little buns in the
oven.
339
Chapter 22: Unmasking the Details of Ferret Love

Breeding the female two days in a row may cause her to produce a bigger
litter. If the fuzzy has fewer than five kits to nurse, she may go back into 
heat two to three weeks after the kits are born. This occurrence is called 
lactational estrus.
Romance and schmoozing are the last things on a male fuzzy’s mind when he
meets up with his dream girl. The male ferret practically tackles the female
when he grabs her by the nape of the neck to mount her. He uses her to mop
every corner of his condo, even though she may be screaming and biting in
protest. When she goes into submission, he has his way with her, and it isn’t
uncommon for him to return for second or third helpings. No courtship is
involved — unless you call clubbing her over the head and dragging her off
by the fur to the nearest cave romantic. Some males are actually gentle, and
their mates actually seem to enjoy themselves. But, for the most part, unal-
tered boys are no Don Juans.
The typical Mustelid love lasts an hour or so on average, with ten minutes
being noted for some unimpressive fellows and an awesome three hours
being noted for some marathon guys. 
The following list presents a couple things you should be aware of so you
don’t panic or cause injury:
 Females often receive puncture wounds on the neck during the mating
ritual. Blood is common, but violently shaking the female and/or causing
wounds serious enough for profuse bleeding isn’t. Separate the pair
immediately.
 The typical mating ritual of ferrets — specifically the neck biting and
prolonged intercourse — causes the release of hormones, which stimu-
lates ovulation. Without the hormone, the female won’t release her eggs
and will remain in heat.
 The male ferret’s penis has a bony hook at the tip that causes it to
become latched inside the female after he penetrates. And the male
remains hooked until he decides that he’s had enough — no sooner.
Don’t try to separate ferrets in the middle of the act. Besides ruining the
mood, forcing a separation may injure one or both fuzzies.
Female carpet sharks are induced ovulators, which means that their eggs
aren’t released until mating actually takes place. Pressure on the cervix,
caused by the act of mating, and neck biting stimulates the release of the
eggs (ovulation) 30 to 40 hours after the deed is done. Sperm can survive in
the female for 36 to 48 hours. As many as 18 (typically 5 to 13) eggs are fertil-
ized. The vulva begins to dry and shrink after a week and returns to normal
size in three to four weeks (longer if breeding took place long after estrus
began).
340
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

If the shrinkage doesn’t begin after a week or so, your fuzzy hasn’t estab-
lished pregnancy, and you should set a new date with the male ferret.
What Happens If Your Unaltered 
Ferret Isn’t Bred?
What if you decide not to breed your fuzzy after she goes into estrus? Not
every ferret is bred every season for many reasons. But because female fer-
rets are induced ovulators, they remain in heat indefinitely until they’re bred,
and the result of a prolonged estrus can be deadly.
When a ferret is in estrus, her level of estrogen rises dramatically. This raised
level of hormone, when in heat, suppresses the production of blood cells in
the bone marrow. Prolonged suppression results in a condition called aplastic
anemia. This condition is almost always fatal if left untreated because the
ferret’s red blood cells aren’t replaced as needed and/or she’ll succumb to
bacterial infections from the lack of white blood cells. Some signs of aplastic
anemia may include pale gums, hind-end weakness, patches of fur loss, and
small areas of bleeding under the skin. 
You have several ways to bring your female ferret out of estrus and harm’s way:
 Breed her to an unaltered male.
 Breed her to a vasectomized male. (The hormones are still going strong,
but the road is blocked.)
 Have a ferret-knowledgeable vet give her a hormone injection to fake her
out of heat (see Chapter 12 for tips on finding a vet).
A hormone injection and breeding to a vasectomized male are short-
term solutions that cause a false pregnancy in your female. She’ll eventu-
ally come back into heat and have the same problem. If you’ve decided
that breeding your female isn’t for you, you should proceed to the last
suggestion.
 Spay her! (See Chapter 12 for more information.)
Mothering the Mom-to-Be
About two weeks into your fuzzy’s pregnancy, you should be able to gently
palpate her belly and feel the small walnut-sized babies. However, she may
not show the typical bulging signs of pregnancy until one month has passed.
The kits should arrive in about 41 to 43 days (usually 42 days), barring any
341
Chapter 22: Unmasking the Details of Ferret Love

unforeseen circumstances. Until then, get ready to pamper and schmooze
your fuzzy even more than you already do — for at least a couple of months.
If you’re a true ferret lover (and you’d better be if you plan on breeding fer-
rets), mothering isn’t too difficult a job for you. Just triple your current
efforts. Your care may very well be rewarded with a healthy litter of adorable
kits. On the other hand, you must accept that complications are common no
matter how well you care for her.
This section details what kind of care you should give to the mother fuzzy,
from her feedings to her environment.
You should handle your pregnant fuzzy gently and very frequently to get her
as comfortable with you as possible. This positive interaction between you
and the mom is critical, especially if you need to physically intervene during
or shortly after the birth. An unfamiliar hand poked into her nest may cause
mom to reject and/or cannibalize her kits. For this reason, the person who
handles momma ferret most often during pregnancy should be the only
person to invade the nest if invasion becomes absolutely necessary.
I suggest that you, as a serious ferret breeder, find another breeder (if you
don’t have another female to breed yourself) who will have a ferret giving
birth around the same time as your little girl. Make prior arrangements to
place your kits with the other nursing female if your mom proves to be an
unfit mother (ferret moms aren’t always good moms; see the later section
“Some Problems You May Face”), because hand-rearing kits is next to impos-
sible. (See the final two sections of this chapter for more on foster moms and
hand rearing.)
Depending on the time of year, the new mom will go back into heat either two
or three weeks after her kits are weaned or when the next breeding season
arrives. A healthy ferret can have up to three successful litters per year,
although most reputable breeders stick with one or two litters a year per ferret.
Strange craving? Keeping mom nourished
Pickles and ice cream aren’t likely to be on the list of things your pregnant
fuzzy will crave. However, a pregnant ferret does need some extra nutrition to
maintain her strength, good health, and body condition before the kits arrive.
Extra nutrition is necessary during the nursing period as well.
The following list presents some tips for keeping your pregnant fuzzy in good
health and ready to deliver:
 Experts recommend that a pregnant ferret’s diet contain 35 to 40 percent
protein and 15 to 20 percent fat. You should increase the number of daily
feedings when the fuzzy begins to lactate, or produce milk. Most nursing
moms are extra thin, so keep up on the extra nutrition.
342
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

 Keep meat baby food or other healthy foods on hand for treats to feed
during playtime and cuddling. Your fuzzy should also have her basic
food (kibble, if you choose) available at all times, as well as plenty of
fresh water (see Chapter 8 for more on normal fuzzy diets).
 Many breeders supplement the pregnant and nursing ferret’s basic diet
with cooked meat and eggs. You can use a thicker Ferret Feeding
Formula or Bob’s Chicken Gravy (see Chapter 25), or you can come up
with your own creative recipes.
Pregnant and nursing ferrets are prone to some ailments that can be life-
threatening to both mom and the kits. It’s important that you monitor your
female’s health and behavior closely. (For more information on mother
fuzzy’s ailments, see the sidebar “Conditions your female may encounter.”)
Providing a maternity ward
You can keep pregnant fuzzies with other pregnant fuzzies, but you must sep-
arate them and give them private rooms at least two weeks before the kits are
due. The private room should be a secure enclosure with extra bedding and a
snuggly nest box. Providing a nest box is imperative, because it helps to keep
the babies close together and warm. A baby that gets separated from the nest
quickly chills and dies. The box also provides much-needed privacy for the
new family. The following list runs through the many considerations you
should make for your fuzzy’s maternity ward, from the nest box to the envi-
ronment of the entire room:
 You need to create an enclosed nesting area to simulate the under-
ground den area that a ferret would nest in the wild. You can use a
wooden parrot nest box, which are better ventilated and control mois-
ture better than plastic. If you prefer plastic, head over to the section on
building your own nest boxes in Chapter 5. The box should be clean and
smooth to prevent injuries to the mom and kits. Openings to nest boxes
should also be very smooth to protect mom when she enters and exits
the box. Her belly and nipples will be vulnerable to abrasions.
 Make sure the cage contains no openings greater than 3⁄4"-x-3⁄4" because
newborns are about the size of the average pinky finger. If necessary,
you can kit-proof the nursery by safely attaching cardboard, sheet metal,
or acrylic glass “guards” inside the cage around the entire perimeter
(they should extend 5 to 6 inches high).
 Provide the appropriate bedding for the cage and box. Be careful about
what type of bedding you choose. Avoid cloth or other materials that
can snag little claws or unravel (stray fibers can strangle tiny heads and
limbs). Also babies have been lost and died in the “folds” of cloth. Cross
shredded paper can work well, as can clean straw or hay.
343
Chapter 22: Unmasking the Details of Ferret Love

 Don’t remove any extras that momma ferret adds. As her due date draws
close, mom will begin to arrange her baby room just perfectly. She’ll
always pluck some fluffy wads of fur off her abdomen to line the nest
with. The soft fur will be an extra comfort to the helpless kits. This also
gives the kits access to the nipples later on and puts her skin closer to
the kits for body heat.
 Be quiet and limit your activity around the maternity ward as delivery
approaches. No playing your bongos or allowing the dogs to romp
around and shake the cage. Disturbances may cause mom to panic and
eat her kits when they finally do arrive.
Heading Off to the Delivery Room
This is an exciting time for you as you wait for the big day to arrive. You can
be comforted by the fact that most ferrets give birth with little difficulty. A
few will require your or your vet’s intervention. But most of the work will be

Conditions your female may encounter
Unfortunately, your mother ferret may develop
the following conditions, all of which require
immediate veterinary attention:
 Eclampsia: Possibly related to diet and
stress, this occurs late in pregnancy but
before kits are born. Can kill both the mom
and unborn kits. Signs: Loss of appetite,
lethargy, dehydration, black/tarry poop,
severe coat shedding. Exact cause is
unknown.
 Mastitis: Bacterial infection in the mam-
mary glands that occurs during the early
stages of lactation. A common cause of
mastitis is having rough edges on the nest
box or too high an opening on the nest box.
As mom drags herself in and out of the box,
she continually irritates her swollen breast
tissue, often receiving little abrasions or
cuts that allow bacteria to enter. Signs:
Swelling, hardening, discoloration, and ten-
derness of mammary glands; anorexia;
lethargy; inability to nurse kits (in severe
cases).
 Nursing sickness: Possibly related to diet
and stress, this occurs shortly before or
shortly after the kits are weaned. Signs:
Loss of appetite, weakness, weight loss,
lack of coordination, dehydration. Exact
cause is unknown.
 Vaginitis: Results from general irritation to
the vulva and secondary bacterial infection,
often caused by bedding material such as
hay, straw, and wood chips. Signs: Yellow
discharge from the vaginal area.
 Pyometra: Bacterial infection of the uterus
that occurs in unaltered, non-pregnant
females. Signs: Pus discharge from vagi-
nal area, distended abdomen from pus-
filled uterus, lethargy, depressed appetite,
increase in water consumption, fever.

done by your ferret. The following sections take you through a normal deliv-
ery and a difficult delivery to show you what to expect and what you need to
be prepared to handle.
No matter the delivery style, never assume (you or your vet) that the deliv-
ery is complete. Making sure that no kits are left behind is essential to the life
of your fuzzy mom. Watch your ferret’s behavior. If she seems distressed,
make sure that you (if you’re qualified) or your vet feels the jill’s belly to rule
out the possibility that another kit (dead or alive) is still inside her. Failing to
check may lead to the death of your new mom and any unborn kits. If possi-
ble, wait to do any exams on her until she’s at least fed her kits.
The typical delivery
A normal kit delivery can happen quite quickly; two to three hours is typical
for average-sized litters. In larger litters, the birthing process may take a little
longer, with several kits arriving each hour. You and your vet should quietly
observe mom for arising problems during this time, but don’t disturb her
unless absolutely necessary.
Watch for kits still stuck in the placental sack. You’ll have to help them out if
mom fails to do so. She’ll lick them clean and stimulate their breathing when
they do get out. A kit stuck in the sack for too long will suffocate.
Allow mom to chew the umbilical cords in half instead of you cutting them.
The crushing force of her chomp will keep the loose ends from bleeding.
Also, make sure that mom eats all the placental material. As disgusting as this
practice seems to humans, the placenta provides much-needed nourishment
for the fatigued mom. It contains hormones that help the uterus to shrink and
is also rich in iron (to promote milk production).
After this process, the new fuzzy mom usually curls up around her new kits,
and they in turn immediately begin to suckle. Many ferret breeders agree that
the first three days of the kits’ lives are the most crucial. If the kits survive
these difficult days, the chances of long-term survival are greatly heightened.
Don’t mess with that nest! Mom is a great housekeeper and will clean up after
the birth, eating most of the afterbirth. You may remove any dead babies if
necessary, but mom will usually eat them before you can get to them.
Disturbing the nest during those first three days increases the likelihood of
cannibalism or mom rejecting the babies.

The difficult delivery
Many kit deliveries are far from typical, unfortunately. Many things can go
wrong with a delivery and lead to the death of a kit, the death of your fuzzy
mom, and/or the need for an emergency cesarean section. The following list
presents some common occurrences:
 Kits born too quickly for mom may be a mass of entangled umbilical
cords, resembling a small pile of spaghetti and pinky meatballs.
Entangled kits can’t nurse, and they get cold quickly and die. Also, limbs
and lives may be lost due to the constriction of the drying cords and pla-
centas around body parts. 
 Even though most kits die inside mom if they aren’t delivered by the
44th day, some overdue kits can continue to grow, presenting problems
if delivery ensues (by blocking the birth canal, for instance).
 A kit in an unusual birthing position (such as its head tucked into its
chest) almost always blocks the birth canal, where it can die and pre-
vent the other kits from making their grand entrances. Unfortunately,
those poor kits also die. And then mom cries, neglects the kits already
delivered, and acts restless.
 Kits with congenital defects often become stuck in the birth canal and die.
 Small or overdue litters can produce dangerously large kits. Large kits
can cause a holdup in the birth canal.
Depending on the cause of the difficult delivery, your vet may inject a labor-
inducing drug or perform a cesarean section. It’s a procedure that some fuzzy
moms face. If the healthy mom is well cared for after the surgery, she almost
always is physically capable of nursing and caring for her kits properly.
Some Problems You May Face after Birth
Hopefully all your kits will arrive safely and soundly. If so, you’ll be happy as a
clam and looking forward to helping raise the fuzzy family (or rehome them
when they’re old enough). What could possibly go wrong now? Many things,
actually. You still have a long way to go before the babies are out of the woods.
Some ferrets just aren’t cut out to be moms (or a human may make a mistake
during a pregnancy to cause the ferret to become a bad parent; see the first
section of this chapter for more). And even if you have the perfect mother
fuzzy, situations may arise that prevent her from nursing her babies. In these
situations, which I describe in the following sections, a foster mom is vital in
helping keep the kits alive — unless the kits have already been cannibalized.
346
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

And if your fuzzy mom dies during pregnancy or delivery, the role of the
foster mom becomes even more vital. As sad as it seems, the possibility isn’t
that far-fetched.
A difficult mother
New moms that are nervous or uncomfortable often make poor ferret moth-
ers. Some ferrets just weren’t meant to be moms, so they reject or cannibal-
ize their babies for no apparent reason. But reasons do exist, and they are
valid to the fuzzies. The following list shows you how to avoid possible diffi-
cult situations:
 Fuzzy moms like their kits warm, so cold babies almost always are
rejected. If mom is away for a period of time (at a surgery, for instance),
keeping the babies warm while she’s away is essential. Or, if the kits
wander away and get chilled, warm them up before returning them to
the nest. (See the earlier section “Providing a maternity ward” for some
tips.)
 Some moms require a meal before cozying up to their new babies. If
your ferret mom seems uninterested after delivering all those kits, offer
her some warm canned food or her kibble moistened with warm water.
 Fluctuations in cage temperature, noise, and/or activity surrounding
the nest can make a mom cannibalize or reject her youngsters. Keep
the area around the cage and nest calm. Now isn’t the time to let the
kids come in to see the new arrivals (see the earlier section “Providing a
maternity ward” for more tips).
A mother incapable of nursing
Some fuzzy moms simply don’t produce enough milk, or any milk at all, for
their kits to nurse on. One possible cause is mastitis (see the earlier sidebar
“Conditions your female may encounter”). You (along with your vet) need to
monitor the activity level and growth of all the kits at all times while they’re
nursing. Kits should gain weight daily, tripling by day 10 (see Chapter 23 for
more). A kit that doesn’t get enough nourishment slowly starves; he loses the
desire to suckle, chills, and eventually dies. Weigh your babies daily, because
a newborn fuzzy can live only three days without eating before he dies.
If the ferret mother is producing some milk, you can leave the kits with mom
as long as you supplement the feedings with kitten milk replacer. The best
solution, however, is receiving the assistance of a foster mom (see the follow-
ing section).
347
Chapter 22: Unmasking the Details of Ferret Love

Calling on the foster mom
A breeder should try to have a foster fuzzy mom waiting in the wings in case
an emergency arises with your momma — whether it’s one of your own fer-
rets or a fellow ferret breeder’s ferret. Most foster ferrets readily take new
kits into their nests. Hopefully, your foster fuzzy is already nursing kits close
in age to the ones being introduced. If she’s a good milk producer, foster-
nursing shouldn’t be a problem for her, because ferrets can nurse more kits
than they have available nipples.
The best way to introduce the “orphans” into the foster mom’s nest is to first
remove the foster mom. Allow the new kits to intermingle with the existing
kits so that the new kits’ scent becomes less distinct from the others’ scent. If
everyone smells the same, no one can complain! 
In the rare instance that the foster mom rejects the kits (be sure to monitor
them closely to watch for this), you need to find an immediate replacement. If
you can’t locate one, hand-rearing the kits is an option, but a very difficult
one (see the sidebar “Hand-rearing kits as a last resort”). If the kits are less
than 10 days old, they’ll most likely die. The success rate increases with
older kits.
348
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 
Hand-rearing kits as a last resort
Hand-rearing a kit is an emotionally and physi-
cally exhausting endeavor that rarely pays off.
The mortality rate, even with experienced fuzzy
humans, is high. Kits need a mother’s milk for at
least ten days in the early stages of their lives.
Successful hand-rearing is possible if you start
with healthy kits that are 2 weeks old. In any
case, you should give it your best shot if hand-
rearing is your only option.
To hand-rear, give the kits kitten-milk replacer
every four to six hours via a plastic eyedropper
or bottle. Make sure you give the food in small
amounts and very slowly to avoid aspiration
pneumonia. Tube feeding is difficult, even for
the experienced, so take it slow. If you make it to
week three, introduce the babies daily to a soft
diet, such as canned cat or ferret food. The kits
still need supplemental feedings until they
reach 4 to 5 weeks old.

I
f you make it through the pregnancy and birthing ordeal — hey, it’s stress-
ful for all involved — you may be fortunate enough to watch a kit or two
grow up. Healthy kits grow rapidly, both physically and emotionally. It won’t
be long before you’re wiping away the tears in your eyes as you proclaim, “It
seems like only yesterday Scooter was covered with newborn fuzz!”
This chapter takes you step by step through the developmental stages of
carpet sharks. Some stages aren’t too pleasant, but they’ll be only temporary
if you do your part as a good fuzzy human. From physical changes to behav-
ioral changes, I tell you what to expect almost every step of the way and how
to handle the changes to produce happy and healthy ferrets. However, keep
this in mind: When it comes to fuzzbutts, nothing is set in stone!
Fuzzy Infancy: Birth to 3 Weeks
Kits (baby ferrets) are born into the world completely helpless and depen-
dent on their mothers for survival. Their eyes and ears are sealed shut, ren-
dering them blind and deaf. A small layer of fuzz covers their tiny bodies,
which are smaller than a normal tube of lipstick (see Figure 23-1). Newborns
typically weigh in at a whopping 6 to 12 grams. Most kits are born without
any teeth, although baby incisors usually appear by day ten.

Healthy newborn kits have only two goals: getting food and keeping warm.
Immediately after birth, they’ll latch onto one of mom’s nipples if allowed and
remain there for a long period of time, gorging themselves on rich milk.
Adequately fed newborns should gain between 21⁄2–3 grams per day during
their first week of life, doubling their birth weight by day five. Despite having
just been squeezed through the birth canal and dropped into the cold world,
newborn ferrets are active and mobile, although they have nowhere to go just
yet. They explore their nest a tiny bit and start to develop the little muscles
in their legs. They’re able to recognize mom and siblings through smell.
During the first few weeks, however, the young kits need to be stimulated by
mama fuzzy to go to the bathroom.
During the second week of life, kits should gain about 4 grams per day. By 10
days old, they should’ve tripled their birth weight and should average about
30 grams. During the third week, the daily weight gain should be about 6
grams. And by 3 weeks old, your kits should be at least ten times heavier
than when they were born.

3-week-old

Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

At three weeks, the males and females are easier to tell apart (without cheat-
ing and turning them over). Females are daintier and have narrower heads.
Boys are butterballs with their wide heads and stockier builds.
Even though fuzzies are born with their eyes closed, you can tell which ones
are albinos because the color of their eyes shows through their thin skin. If
you can’t see dark color behind a fuzzy’s semitransparent eyelids, you know
you have a bouncing baby albino. (For more on fuzzy colors and what they
entail, head to Chapter 2.)
Furball Toddlerhood: 3 to 6 Weeks
Kits that hit 3 weeks of age are working to rapidly develop their nest legs as
they boldly explore their environment. Mom is still a part of their lives, keep-
ing a close eye on kits that may wander too far away. Although the kits still
rely on mom for the majority of their nourishment, natural weaning should
begin at this age. The baby canine teeth and some baby premolars are begin-
ning to erupt, and permanent incisor teeth are breaking through and pushing
the baby incisors out. You can offer these kits a soft mush or canned food a
few times a day (for more on diet, see Chapter 8).
Weaning doesn’t involve caging mom and plopping down a crock of odd-
smelling mush in front of your confused kits. Weaning is a gradual process
that should begin at the age of 3 weeks and be completed at around 6 weeks.
Kits need time to adapt to the nutritional change. To wean effectively, first
familiarize yourself with the diet information in Chapter 8. This is imperative,
because you need to understand nutrition in ferrets. Starting out with canned
food or a soft mush made with moistened kibble is only one way to start your
babies. As kits get older, you should offer a variety of other foods, such as
chicken and beef (either raw or cooked). A change of kibble and canned food
is recommended. This is also the time to introduce small mice and insects if
desired. The more variety offered, the better. The weaning process is messy
as the kits delve face first into their food, but it’s a relatively easy process.
During these three weeks, the kits will naturally begin to rely less and less on
mom and start to prefer the replacement diet you offer.
The fourth week is somewhat of a turning point in a kit’s new life. His eyes
and ears begin to show signs of opening up to the world. His soft, white fuzz
should start taking on some color and pattern, giving you a glimpse into his
future. More baby premolars also start to erupt around this time. Healthy kits
351
Chapter 23: From Birth to Bundle of Energy: Walking a Fuzzy’s Timeline

should be eager to dive into the bowl of soft mush you provide and stuff
themselves while still taking advantage of mom’s milk supply. And although
mom may still want to remind the kits to go to the bathroom, the kits should
show signs of being the self-proficient poopers that their parents are!
By week five, a kit’s eyes and ears have opened and he’s ready to get into
trouble! Kits at this age are extremely active and are starting to rough and
tumble with their siblings. By week six, the kits should start eating more soft
food and start relying less and less on mom for nutritional support. Some
breeders introduce the dreaded first distemper vaccination at this age (see
Chapter 12).
The Terrible Fuzzy Twos: 6 to 10 Weeks
Emotionally, at 6 to 7 weeks old, furball kits should be spending a lot of awake
time playing mock-combat with their siblings. This play is important in devel-
oping hierarchy among the youngsters and preparing them for their futures
as possible top furballs in their new homes!
At around seven weeks, ferrets should quit hanging on mom so much and
start relying almost completely on the soft food you serve. Permanent canines
are pushing through their sensitive gums, sometimes erupting just beside the
baby canines. This is a pretty painful ordeal to the small fuzzbutt and can
cause him to wallow in the throes of teething behavior (see Chapter 20). It
isn’t unusual to have kits with canine teeth side by side for several days until
their baby canines finally fall out.
At 8 weeks old, kits should have four permanent canine teeth. They’re now
capable of eating the hard kibble that most other ferrets rely on. A kit should
have a well-developed and varied diet by now, but if you haven’t started this
process yet, now is the time to introduce him to new tastes and smells.
Babies are so impressionable!
Many private breeders begin to let their kits go to their new humans at
around the age of 8 weeks (see Figure 23-2). Babies are usually using the litter
box by now, and drinking from the water bottle comes easily. Some breeders,
however, wait as long as 12 weeks before letting their babies go. The decision
is up to the breeder and may be based on how comfortable he or she is with
the person buying the ferret. Or it may just be based on personal policy.
Whatever the case, there’s really no disadvantage to waiting the extra four
weeks for your youngster, other than possibly being a bit delayed in getting
him on a varied diet.
352
Part VI: Breeding Ferrets: The Facts, Fallacies, and Plain Ol’ Hard Work 

For those kits that received their first distemper shots at 6 weeks old, 9
weeks of age is the perfect time for the second attack on their heinies. For
complete information on vaccination schedules, head to Chapter 12.
Kits in the 6- to 10-week age range are extremely active in testing their
humans to the limits. This age range is the critical training period, which
many ferret humans fail to recognize. You need to handle your furkids fre-
quently and gently. They need consistency and someone who’s willing to
teach them what is and isn’t acceptable behavior. Because many kits arrive at
pet shops at this age, they frequently don’t receive the proper human guid-
ance (for more on pet shops, see Chapter 4). Many of these toddlers become
troubled teenagers for their unsuspecting humans. Therefore, as a responsi-
ble ferret breeder, you need to begin training as early as possible. (For infor-
mation on ferret training, head to the chapters of Part V.)
Adolescence Already? 10 to 15 Weeks
Your kits should have almost all their permanent teeth by 10 weeks of age.
The little indentations on your fingers and arms are proof enough (see
Chapters 19 and 20 for tips on biting training)! Kidding aside, if your kits
received the proper fuzzy guidance during their terrible twos stage (see the
previous section for advice and the chapters of Part V for tips), adolescence
shouldn’t be too bad.

Chapter 23: From Birth to Bundle of Energy: Walking a Fuzzy’s Timeline

By 3 months old (12 weeks), well-adjusted kits are discovering that humans
can be fun companions. Although the activity level of kits this age still far sur-
passes the average human’s energy levels (even with a double espresso), kits
do begin to mellow a little bit (emphasis on a little bit). Ferret personalities
become well-formed and defined during adolescence. Even though these kits
are still highly influenced by the humans who interact with them, it’s rela-
tively easy to pick out the alpha males and females (top furballs) by watching
them interact with their siblings and humans.

f I could keep writing on and on about ferrets, I would

there to put into one book. This part focuses on a couple
of specific issues. Here I give you a head start on creating
new and exciting ferret recipes to keep your fuzzy from
getting bored with his cuisine. I also discuss ten common
ferret myths and misconceptions so you can wade through
bad information and educate others about fuzzies.

W
hat kind of ferret book would this be if I didn’t dedicate at least one
chapter to beating the tar out of common ferret myths and miscon-
ceptions? Not a complete one. Why do little fuzzies often get unfairly judged?
Well, you always seem to see at least one or two poor groups of animals out
there getting a bad rap. Although some ferret misconceptions are way out in
left field, I suppose one or two have a little merit. (I emphasize little because
the misconceptions are usually little things that people blow way out of pro-
portion and attach to the entire business of ferrets.) All pets have their ups
and downs, their pros and cons — just like people. But to stereotype an entire
group of animals based on a few misconceptions is just plain irresponsible.
The following sections present ten misconceptions commonly associated
with ferrets; and, for the sake of thoroughness, I’ll give you reasons why they
aren’t true!
Ferrets Are Rodents
You think ferrets are rodents? Get out of here. Ferrets are much cuter. Contrary
to popular belief, not all small, furry animals are rodents. Ferrets are relatives
of polecats, actually. Ferrets are carnivores, and most carnivores like to eat
rodents. Most ferrets, however, are too busy sleeping or playing to care! (Head
to Chapter 2 for more on the ferret’s history.)

Ferrets Are Wild, Dangerous Animals
Some uninformed folks think that ferrets are wild, dangerous animals. Sure.
And pigs can fly. Occasionally, ferrets get wild with excitement during play-
time. And the most dangerous thing about them is that you may pull a muscle
when laughing as you watch them do ferret things. Except in Hawaii, where
ferrets are classified as wild animals, and in California (boo, hiss), ferrets
legally meet the definition of domestic: They’re fond of home life and house-
hold affairs. (I like that definition — too bad they don’t cook!) Ferrets are
tame and fit for domestic life. They’ve adapted or have been bred to live with
and be of use to man. (For more on the laws concerning ferrets, check out
Chapter 3.)
In fact, ferrets can’t survive on their own; they require human assistance.
Like dogs and cats (which have more bite incidents than ferrets ever will), all
domestic fuzzies have their moments. They can have bad days and need
timeouts. In the majority of cases, however, a well-treated ferret is a very,
very loving and trusting ferret (to find out how to deal with an abused ferret,
see Chapter 20).
Feral Ferrets Will Take Over!
A feral ferret is one that reverts back to its natural state of wild behavior and
can successfully live and reproduce in the wild. Many people fear that
escapee ferrets will form feral colonies and destroy native wildlife. This fear
is unfounded and virtually impossible for several reasons:
 The majority of would-be escapees in the United States are already
neutered or spayed.
 Unless some little old lady is leaving piles of ferret food under her
bushes and the ferrets actually get a chance to snarf down the food
before other animals steal it, escapee ferrets frequently die of starvation.
Olfactory imprinting on kibble makes it unlikely that ferrets can recog-
nize enough food to survive.
 There is no natural niche for escapee ferrets to fill in the wild. Most envi-
ronments already have efficient predators filling all the possible niches.
A domestic ferret let loose in North America’s wild would be low on the
food chain. (To see how difficult it is to reintroduce even wild ferrets —
like black-footed ferrets — into nature and have them establish viable
colonies, read Chapter 2.)
New Zealand has the only established feral colony of ferrets, and these ferrets
were purposely conditioned and introduced to control the rabbit population
(another of many introduced species). New Zealand had no other predators
358
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

when the ferret was introduced, and the colony of ferrets successfully main-
tains itself on other prey animals (which they’ve been conditioned to eat).
Ferrets Are Vicious Biters
I won’t kid you by saying that ferrets never bite. They can bite for many rea-
sons (see Chapter 20 to get the full rundown). But the vast majority of ferrets
aren’t vicious biters. Comparatively speaking, ferrets are safer than dogs and
cats in terms of inflicting injury or the likelihood of causing death with an
attack. Some ferrets are more temperamental than others, and these buggers
may need more patience.
Like most domestic animals, the more love you give, the more you receive.
Ferrets need daily handling and loving care (see Chapter 10). This daily atten-
tion reduces the possibility of biting, which can happen because of fear or
overstimulation in a rarely handled fuzzy. Even the toughest ferrets can be
turned around with proper handling, time, and patience.
Ferrets Pose a Serious Rabies Risk
Believe it or not, ferrets are extremely resistant to the rabies virus. I know of
no documented case of a human contracting rabies from a ferret. Studies
have indicated that ferrets may not even pass the virus through their saliva,
via a bite, and they note that the amount of rabies virus found in the saliva of
an infected ferret is negligible. And the pet community saw less than a hand-
ful of reported rabies cases in domestic ferrets in the 20th century. Although
some states are still paranoid and automatically impose the “off with its
head” sentence to a misunderstood biting or scratching ferret, most states
have come out of the fog and issue quarantine sentences instead. Hooray for
the smart states! (For more on ferret laws, refer to Chapter 3.)
Still, all ferrets can and should receive their annual rabies vaccination, which
is formulated especially for ferrets, just to be safe (see Chapter 12 for more
on vaccinations).
A Ferret’s Stink Will Never Go Away
All ferrets have scent glands, from which they can on rare occasions emit a
foul odor, next to their heinies. Unneutered, non-descented males are the
worst smell offenders. However, most ferrets are descented and altered at a
young age — at least in the United States. In other countries, descenting is
considered animal abuse, so you have to deal with the occasional poof.
359
Chapter 24: Ten Common Ferret Myths and Misconceptions

Basically, the stink of a ferret depends on your attentiveness as a ferret mom
or dad. Descented ferrets can stay odorless for quite some time, but skin
glands produce a smell over time as well. You need to bathe your ferret as
she approaches the borderline of tolerable stink — but no more than once
every few months or so.
And even better than routine bathing is providing your ferret with a tub of
clean potting soil to dig in (see Chapter 10). The soil will absorb the excess
oil on her skin and leave her smelling quite fresh!
A poor diet can cause your ferret to smell a little muskier than a ferret on a
high-protein, low-ash diet (see Chapter 8). Make sure that you feed your fuzzy
a high-quality diet. Also, bad teeth and dirty ears are two more causes of
stink, so take care of your fuzzy’s grooming and get her regular veterinary
checkups (Chapter 9 covers grooming basics).
Although I always push altering in ferrets, I don’t think descenting is neces-
sary in order for you to live with your ferret. A ferret usually lets loose an
odor when she’s scared, overstimulated, or aggressive (the three Fs: Fear,
Fun, Fight). Unlike with the skunk, a ferret’s smell dissipates rapidly. And
believe it or not, some people actually enjoy the smell of ferret and skunk
spray. Manufacturers have even bottled the skunk smell and marketed it with
good results! Go figure.
Ferrets Can Catch the Common Cold
No! No! No! Ferrets can’t catch the common cold. Colds are caused by rhi-
noviruses, which are species-specific. Fortunately, they don’t attack ferrets.
On the other hand, ferrets can catch influenza A, the flu virus humans are all
too familiar with. They can also catch bacterial respiratory and sinus infec-
tions, which they can pass back to you. Take extra care when handling your
ferret when you or she has the flu.
Ferrets Were Domesticated in Egypt
The notion that ferrets were domesticated in Egypt is about two-and-a-half
centuries old and began with a reference to Libyan ferrets made by Roman
romantic authors Strabo and Pliny. Linnaeus used this reference to state that
ferrets were native to Africa. The rest is history — or, should I say, mis-history.
To add insult to injury, one author claimed to have a hieroglyph that depicted
a ferret. Although the author never produced or published the hieroglyph,
the claims were used to assert that not only were ferrets domesticated in
Egypt, but also domesticated prior to cats. This unproven idea spread like
360
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

wildfire and the ferret community ran with it because of the desperate need
to prove domestication in ferret-free states (see Chapter 3).
According to author Bob Church, as published in John Lewington’s Ferret
Husbandry, Medicine and Surgery, 2nd Edition (Saunders/Elsevier Limited),
“There are no zooarchaeological reports, genetics studies, theological sup-
port, historical documents, hieroglyphs or biogeographical or ecological evi-
dence that document the presence of either the ferret or polecat in Egypt
during the window of domestication. Such ruminations are conjectural sup-
positions, which, through repetition and decades of reprinting, have taken on
a ‘truthfulness of familiarity’ or ‘common knowledge.’ Unfortunately, these
suppositions are regarded as factual by many in the ferret community despite
a singular lack of substantive evidence.”
You can also take into consideration the Egyptian culture, where mummifying
was common practice. The Egyptian people mummified mammals, birds, rep-
tiles, and even eggs. In the long list of animals excavated, not one is a ferret
or polecat. Not a single bone or body of a ferret or polecat has ever turned up
during archeological excavations in or around Egypt. Consider also the eco-
logical conditions of Egypt and the ferret’s inability to withstand heat and go
long periods without water. In fact, no place in the world with ecological con-
ditions like Egypt houses ferrets or polecats. (For more on the history of the
ferret, check out Chapter 2.)
Ferrets Sleep 20+ Hours per Day
Ferrets aren’t quite the lazy bums that people claim they are — not if they’re
happy and healthy, that is! A ferret caged all day may sleep 18–20 hours, but
she’s likely to be bored and depressed. Like their polecat relatives, healthy,
free-roaming ferrets with little cage time should sleep only 15–18 hours a day.
Your ferret should be out and about four hours a day at the very least. If she
isn’t used to getting exercise, she may become sluggish and she’ll constantly
look for a place to just curl up and sleep away. Get your ferret out to play
(see Chapter 10)!
Ferrets Need to Have Food 
Available at All Times
Most fuzzies don’t need a constant food flow. Only ferrets that are insuli-
nomic need to have food available at all times! Personally, I believe people
put too much emphasis on making sure the ferret has food at all times.
Fuzzies wouldn’t have a free buffet in the wild, so why do people think
361
Chapter 24: Ten Common Ferret Myths and Misconceptions

domestication is any different? Physiologically, ferrets are designed to go
considerable periods of time without food (well, it’s a little more complicated
than that).
Ferret owners influence how often their ferrets need to eat, because ferrets
adapt their eating cycles to what they’re being fed. For example, if you feed
your ferret a kibble that’s high in carbs, blood-sugar fluctuations can drive
your ferret to eat more often — perhaps as often as every four to five hours.
A very poor diet can drive her to eat even more often, perhaps every three 
to four hours. However, giving your fuzzy a diet that’s high in fat- and meat-
based protein can leave her satisfied much longer — perhaps as long as eight
to ten hours.
I feed my ferrets mice, Wysong Archetype freeze-dried diet, and/or some
high-quality kibble twice a day. I leave them with no food overnight. And
they’re all healthy, muscular, and happy! (For more on giving your fuzzy the
proper diet, chomp your way over to Chapter 8.)

I
believe that the key to good health for any
animal is a well-balanced and varied diet.
Whether you want to add some variety into your
ferret’s diet or need that perfect homemade
“soup” for the sick or recovering ferret, I have the
right recipe for you! This chapter provides some
great recipes, compliments of my friend Bob
Church, ferret guru and fellow fuzzy lover, for you to try with your ferret.
With a few exceptions (Bob’s Chicken Gravy, for instance, has sent dozens of
blenders to the great garbage dump in the sky), most of these recipes are
easy to make. You may even get inspired to come up with one or two recipe
ideas of your own.
Bob recommends his recipes with some simple caveats:
 He assumes that your vet has checked your ferret and has reviewed the
recipe to determine if your fuzzy’s health allows you to give him the food.
 Ferrets are olfactory imprinted, meaning they set their food preferences
by the time they’re 6 months old, so an older ferret may not want to try
the foods right away (see Chapter 8 for more information on olfactory
imprinting and converting your fuzzy to a new diet). If you put in some
time and effort, though, you’ll find that your fuzzy will accept most of
these recipes. Younger ferrets and kits will accept them right away.
 Most of these recipes represent snacks or meals, not long-term diets.
The recipes are designed to increase enrichment (see Chapter 10), offer

variety, and increase dietary choice. Make sure you consult with your vet
in order to ensure your ferret is getting a complete and balanced diet.
 Ferrets that eat a soft diet often will develop dental tartar. This also hap-
pens with hard, crunchy kibble, but the rate of deposit seems faster with
the soft diet. Make sure you don’t hurt your ferret while you’re trying to
help him! Tooth brushing and annual dental checkups are a must,
regardless of the food your ferret eats.
All these recipes have been taste-tested and fuzzy-approved by ferrets all
over the world! However, you’ll notice that the exact ingredient measure-
ments are missing from most of the recipes. Bob wants to leave this part
mostly up to you so that you can modify the food for the specific needs of
your ferret, as advised by your vet. The measurements may require some
trial and error on your part. It’s likely that you’ll never make two recipes the
same, unless you write down exactly how much you choose to use of this,
that, and the other thing.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Bob’s Chicken Gravy
Bob’s Chicken Gravy is easy to digest and gentle on the stomach, making it great for fer-
rets that aren’t feeling too well or are coming off a liquid diet and moving back onto
solid foods. This recipe is about 70 percent chicken and 30 percent animal fat, so you
need a heavy-duty blender (or a hand-cranked meat grinder) and probably some gog-
gles. If you need to, you can cut the recipe in half.
1 whole roasting chicken, cut into small pieces
(don’t remove the skin, fat, bones, or giblets)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon fatty-acid supplement (Ferretone
or Linatone)
1 cup ferret, mink, or high-quality feline kibble
2 tablespoons fine bran, whole oats, or
Metamucil
1 tube Nutri-Cal (use 1⁄2 half or 1⁄4 tube for
insulinoma ferrets)
3 or 4 eggshells
4 tablespoons honey
1 cup fat trimmings from any meat source
safe for human consumption (uncooked)
1 Put on your goggles (if you have them). Puree the chicken with the fat, kibble, and
eggshells. Add water until you make a thin gravy. Remove your goggles.
2 Pour the mix into a pot and cook on the stove for 30 minutes or until it has the consis-
tency of cream or thick gravy.

365
Chapter 25: Ten Recipes Your Ferret Will Love
3 Add the rest of the ingredients to the pot and mix well.
4 Let the mixture cool before serving.
Bob’s Tip: The best way to get your ferret used to Bob’s Chicken Gravy is to dip your finger
into the mixture and touch it to the nose of your ferret. He’ll lick it off as he cleans his nose,
and eventually he’ll learn to love the food. Here’s another tip: Take what’s left over after a
meal and pour the stuff into zipper bags or ice-cube trays. Store in the freezer. When serv-
ing the gravy, add water or Pedialyte to get the desired consistency, and microwave it until
it’s warm. Be sure to mix it well to get rid of any “hot spots” resulting from the microwave!
(Note: You can blend to desired consistencies for a ferret’s special needs.)
The Metamucil/bran/oats helps to control loose stools that sometimes happen when a
ferret is first placed on chicken gravy. It’s supposed to represent the 2 percent to 4 percent
indigestible fiber (fur, connective tissue, and so on) consumed when a ferret eats whole
prey (see Chapter 8).
Why Nutri-Cal? Ferrets that eat a kibble diet have made physiological adapta-
tions for a carbohydrate diet that include a decrease in ability for gluconeogene-
sis. (Gluconeogenesis is the formation of glucose from noncarbohydrate
sources.) It takes about two weeks for the ferret’s physiology to make the shift
from a sugar-based energy system to a protein-based system and full efficiency
of liver and kidney gluconeogensis to occur. Because Bob’s Chicken Gravy was
designed to get ferrets off a liquid diet and back onto kibble (as stated in the
intro), the sugars in the Nutri-Cal and the honey are designed to prevent low
blood sugar and the physiological shift. If Bob’s Chicken Gravy is used as a long-
term diet, after two weeks the honey and Nutri-Cal should be removed from the
recipe and a vitamin replacement should step in.
The sugars in honey are roughly half fructose and half glucose. The metabolism of these
two sugars is different. The glucose immediately enters the bloodstream and raises the
blood sugar. This gives the ferret the energy needed to fuel the initial metabolism of pro-
tein to glucose (gluconeogenesis requires glucose to initiate the process). Fructose isn’t
digested as effectively as other sugars. Fructose is absorbed in the jejunum and is metabo-
lized in the liver, usually into triglycerides. This helps the ferret put on fat weight without
causing a high increase in the blood sugar. There is some evidence that fructose reduces
the effectiveness of insulin, which can be a help in insulinomic ferrets.

Bob’s Chicken Ferretisee
This recipe reminds me of a springtime salad, almost good enough for humans to eat
over a crisp bed of lettuce. It’s easy to make and store, is highly nutritious, and its small
pieces make it great to offer as a treat and training aid. Chicken Ferretisee isn’t designed
to be a complete meal, however.
366
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
1⁄2 chicken
1-2 tablespoons lard or olive oil
Fatty acid supplement (such as Ferretone or
Linatone)
1⁄2 cup kibble, ground up (a coffee grinder
works well)
1 Cut pieces of whole chicken (including the bone) into 1⁄2- to 1-inch cubes. Use a cleaver
when the chicken is partially frozen.
2 Melt some lard (or heat olive oil) in a wok until it’s about 1⁄8-inch deep.
3 Quick-fry the chicken cubes in the lard until they reach a golden-brown color. (The goal
is to kill any possible bacteria but leave the inside as raw as possible.)
4 Set the chicken cubes aside to drain and cool.
5 Place the chicken cubes in a bowl and lightly spray them with Ferretone or Linatone
(use an atomizer).
6 Add the ground-up kibble to the bowl and toss the mixture like a salad.
Bob’s Tip: Freeze the unused portions and thaw as needed.
Foster’s Tuna Shake
You may not like the idea of drinking fish, but your ferret will lap it up and shake for
more. Foster’s Tuna Shake is a great occasional snack and it can be frozen, so a single
batch can last a long time. Bob advises that most ferrets will be so olfactory imprinted
that they’ll ignore this food, so start off with the young ferrets (see Chapter 8 for diet
conversion tips).
1 can tuna (packed in spring water)
1⁄8 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon smooth peanut butter
4 chicken bones — a back, 2 legs, and a wing
Pedialyte (optional)

367
Chapter 25: Ten Recipes Your Ferret Will Love
1 Dump the tuna (including the spring water) into a blender.
2 Add the heavy cream, the peanut butter, and the four chicken bones.
3 Blend to a milkshake-like consistency. (You can add a little Pedialyte if you want for taste.)
Bob’s Tip: For any recipe that includes heavy cream or another dairy product, you can
blend in a Lactaid tablet if you know that your ferret is a little lactose intolerant or shows
signs (gets diarrhea, for instance) after eating it. Most ferrets tolerate the lactose in heavy
cream, though. Because this recipe is so fat-rich, some ferrets with liver or gall bladder
problems may have a hard time eating it. Be sure to discuss this treat with your vet if your
ferret has a problem with it.
Bear’s Jerky
The jerky made for humans has a lot of salt and seasonings ferrets don’t really need.
Making Bear’s Jerky solves that problem and makes the occasional treat much cheaper
to dole out.
1–2 pounds brisket (cheap cut)
Fatty-acid supplement (such as Ferretone 
or Linatone)
High-quality bone meal fit for human
consumption
1 Cut the fat off the brisket.
2 Slice the remaining meat into 1⁄4-inch-thick strips.
3 Place the strips onto a dehydrator screen, and spray the surface of the meat with the
Ferretone or Linatone.
4 Sprinkle the bone meal on the top of the meat.
5 Let the meat dehydrate before serving.
There’s a possibility of meat spoilage if you don’t dehydrate the meat properly.
Always follow the instructions to ensure that the meat is safely and completely
dried.

Water
Non-flavored gelatin
Chicken or beef, finely chopped
Beef or chicken bouillon
368
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Stella’s Super Soup
This is a yummy meal that you can dish out on a daily basis to your appreciative ferret,
but don’t replace his diet with it. If you divide your basic stock into three parts and
then add kibble to one, heavy cream to another, and both to the third, you’ll have three
“flavors” that are sure to enrich your ferret’s palate.
1⁄2 gallon of water
Leftovers from your last turkey or chicken
dinner
1 teaspoon chicken soup stock
Ground kibble or heavy cream
1 Bring the water to a boil.
2 Add the leftover bones from your last turkey or chicken dinner.
3 Cut up the skin, giblets, fat, and meat into small pieces. Add the pieces to the 
boiling water.
4 Boil the mixture until the bones begin to get soft (about 20 minutes). Add the chicken
soup stock.
5 Add ground kibble or heavy cream to thicken the stock to your desire.
6 Remove from the stove.
7 Let the mixture cool before serving.
The bulk of the nutrients in Stella’s Super Soup come from the chicken leftovers
and chicken soup stock. The kibble and/or heavy cream are just meant to be
thickening and flavoring agents. I’ve left it up to the owners which one to choose,
because you know the food preferences of your individual ferret. The kibble and
cream can be left out without problem; they are just there to help address the
ferret’s olfactory imprinting.
Tui’s Chewies
Ferrets love to gnaw, and this treat will give your floor monkey something healthy and
fun to gnaw on. Tui’s Chewies aren’t designed to be a replacement for commercially
made chews, but rather an occasional alternative.

1 Dissolve the non-flavored gelatin in boiling water, per the instructions on the 
gelatin box.
You can make a super-saturated solution by adding enough water to where no more
gelatin will dissolve; you’ll still see some bits floating around.
2 Toss in the finely chopped chicken or beef.
3 Add some flavor with the chicken or beef bouillon.
4 Pour the mixture onto a cookie sheet (or cookie molds). Cut the mixture into rectangu-
lar shapes when it dries.
5 Place the shapes in a cool dehydrator until they’re rubbery and hardened.
Bob’s Tip: You can also store the small, rectangular yummies uncovered in the freezer.
Sometimes, the chewies will end up more like gummies; when that happens, you can just
freeze them and serve them cold. Ferrets like them either way!
369
Chapter 25: Ten Recipes Your Ferret Will Love
Carnivore Stew
If used as an occasional meal, Carnivore Stew will enrich your ferret’s stomach as much
as it will enrich his life. It’s a great occasional alternative to a monotonous diet of
kibble.
Leftover trimmings from a meat-based meal
(skin, bones, giblets, fat, and meat waste)
Whole bits of kibble
Lard or fish oil (optional)
1 Boil the leftover trimmings until they’re cooked completely.
2 Add the kibble so that it makes up 1⁄3 of the stew.
3 If the mixture is low on fat (should be about 1⁄3 of the total trimmings), add a little lard 
or fish oil.
You can add the kibble during boiling or after; it makes little difference. The
kibble should absorb most of the moisture, creating a gravy-like thickness.
Carnivore Stew should be slightly warmed up before serving to make it more
palatable.

370
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Mickey’s Meatloaf
Okay, not everyone likes mother’s meatloaf, but your ferret will love this one. You can
cut Mickey’s Meatloaf into small pieces that are wonderful for use in training or as 
special treats.
Ground chicken or turkey — uncooked
Chicken broth
One egg
Ground kibble
Whole kibble
Olive or fish oil
Spray oil
Ice cube tray
1 Mix all the ingredients (except the whole kibble and spray oil) like you’re making a
meatloaf (a mound of ground meat mixed with other ingredients).
2 Add just enough whole kibble to spread a crushed piece per square inch.
3 Give the ice cube tray a light coating of spray oil and then fill the tray with the meatloaf.
4 Microwave the tray for a minute or two to harden the food, and then remove the minia-
ture loaves from the tray areas.
You can store the pieces in plastic food containers in your freezer until needed.
Bob’s Tip: To serve, place a small meatloaf on a dish and microwave until you cook it
throughout. Allow it to cool so you don’t burn the mouth of your little floor monkey. Also,
you can substitute ground beef or pork for the chicken or turkey if your ferret will accept it.
Clyde’s Seaside Chunks
The acceptance of this occasional meal is dependent on how olfactory imprinted your
ferret has become, but if he’s open to seafood, he’ll gobble up the Seaside Chunks. You
can cut up the food into tiny chunks to use as treats.
Crawdads, fish, small shrimp, and/or crab
Artificially sweetened gelatin
1 Make the gelatin according to the instructions, except that while you’re mixing the
gelatin, add small bits of seafood, just as you would fruit. (Do not add fruit!)
2 Put the mix into small ice cube trays and store in the refrigerator until used.
Bob’s Tip: You can use any flavor of gelatin your ferret likes; Bob’s ferrets seem to like the
lemon, banana, and grape flavors best.

None of these recipes should take the place of your ferret’s base diet (see
Chapter 8). Ferrets are small animals with small stomachs and giving too
much of a supplement, treat, or snack can unbalance the rest of the diet.
Here’s a handy guide:
 Meals: 100 percent of average meal weight
 Snacks: 10 percent of average meal weight
 Treats: 1 percent of average meal weight
 Samples: A bite or a few licks

Bluto’s BARF
BARF stands for Bones and Raw Food or Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (see
Chapter 8 for all the details). Although this treat may make you want to barf, your fer-
rets should love it as an occasional meal or offered as a special treat. Plus, you can be
happy that Bluto’s BARF is an excellent source of protein for your ferret.
1⁄2-inch frozen chicken chunks
Beef or chicken liver, partially frozen
Chicken hearts or gizzards, partially frozen
Chicken bones
Chicken broth
Frozen fat trimmings (about 1⁄5 th by volume)
1 Mix the frozen meat ingredients (chicken chunks, liver, hearts or gizzards, and fat trim-
mings) in a bowl and cover the mixture with the broth.
2 Boil the chicken bones until the ends start to scratch under the pressure of your 
fingernail.
3 Cut the bones with poultry scissors into small chunks.
4 Add maybe a half-dozen pieces of bone to the bowl containing the meat and broth 
mixture.
5 Place that bowl in the microwave and heat until the broth is near the boiling point.
Allow it to cool.
Bob’s Tip: This recipe seems to work better if you freeze the meat ingredients first and cut
them with a cleaver into 1⁄2-inch chunks while still partially hard. You can serve this recipe
as a soup, freeze it into small blocks for a treat, cook it into a paste, or add it as gravy to
soften kibble.

I think all the dishes in this chapter are safe to use as samples, treats, and
snacks. Snacks and treats should be limited to once per day. Samples should
be limited to twice a day. A few of the recipes, as indicated, can even be used
as occasional meals (a couple times per week, for instance) for most ferrets
that don’t have health problems. Always check with your vet before making
any significant changes to your ferret’s diet.

Ferrets are sociable animals and
enjoy playing together.It’s a good
idea to have more than one.
(Savannah and Kevin,owned by
Deb’s Ferret Rescue & Boarding)
Exercising your ferret (or with
your ferret!) is a great way to
bond with him.Ferrets love to
play! See Chapter 10 for tips on
having fun with your ferret.
(Xavier,owned by Jared Deming)
Though they are clean animals,the
average ferret occasionally needs a
bath.Chapter 9 tells you how to
bathe and groom your ferret,and
how to make the process easier for
both of you.(Milton Millie,owned by
