Preface
William Shakespeare (in Julius Caesar, Act 4, scene 3) wrote:
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
Indeed, society is currently facing a flood of new information and developments about cannabis, the 
subject of this book, and rather momentous decisions must be made for the future.
“Cannabis” in its broad sense refers to the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa), especially its fiber 
products (such as textiles, plastics, and dozens of construction materials), edible seed products (now 
in over a hundred processed foods), psychoactive chemicals (employed both as illicit and medicinal 
drugs), and all associated considerations. In short, cannabis is a generic term referring to all aspects 
of the plant, especially its products and how they are used. Concern over illegal drug usage of can-
nabis has distorted evaluation of all other issues, with polarized camps arguing the merits of their 
perspective and the inferiority of their opponent’s viewpoints. Indeed, it is very difficult to find 
evaluations of cannabis that are not free of bias, distortion, emotion, and selective consideration of 
evidence. The literature and especially the Internet are crowded with opposing claims. On the one 
hand, some proponents insist that cannabis provides the perfect path to economic, ecological, and 
medical salvation for the world. Others, however, contend that it represents a fraudulent hoax that 
will deteriorate financial, moral, physical, and societal health.
Science is a search for truth and provides indispensable guidance to society for the creation and 
adoption of new technologies. Regrettably, scientific research on virtually all aspects of the plant 
species C. sativa has been suppressed for most of the twentieth century, a victim of the sometimes 
observed tendency to avoid examination of sensitive or sinister subjects. Ignorance, however, gen-
erally exacerbates problems and has likely contributed to worsening the substantial harm that has 
become associated with cannabis. Currently, there is an explosion of interest in marijuana forms of 
cannabis, in part because of developing medical applications, but also because of increasing toler-
ance of recreational usage. Nevertheless, governments have long maintained a costly war against 
the consumption of cannabis, and there is official reluctance to alter the status quo. Although so-
called narcotics are widely viewed as intrinsically evil, the leading controlled drug plants have 
some legitimate, useful applications. Much of the world is now insisting on a reappraisal of both 
the industrial (nonintoxicating) and drug aspects of cannabis, and indeed, there are promising new 
applications that deserve to be assessed and, in some cases, adopted. Because Cannabis is first 
and foremost a plant, evaluation of its potential for harm and benefit needs to take account of its 
botanical nature, about which much remains to be explored. This book is an analysis of the various 
economic potentials of Cannabis, based particularly on its extraordinary biological properties.
Up to a century ago, most people lived on farms and were well acquainted with how critically 
important crop plants are for human survival. Today, the plants that sustain us are of limited con-
cern for the majority, except for occasional grumbling when shortages result in dramatic increases 
in the price of particular foods. Nevertheless, cultivated plants are critical for human welfare, and 
C. sativa, once considered a foundational contributor to civilization, has the potential of once again 
becoming a major contributor to society.

Preface
This volume does not examine to any appreciable extent the sociological and political aspects 
associated with cannabis but does present sufficient historical, cultural, medical, and legal back-
ground to provide context for scientific and economic issues. The conflicting claims for medicinal 
virtues and toxicological vices are examined based mainly on the most recent authoritative scien-
tific reviews. The attempt is made consistently to reflect majority scientific opinion, but the reader 
will be aware that many aspects of cannabis are controversial. Some of the presentation may shock 
those who have been conditioned by the past century of negative information and fearmongering 
about every aspect of cannabis. Some may be offended by the inclusion of graphic details about 
marijuana usage, but this information is already widely available and is necessary to understand 
the subject. This book attempts to document both the virtues and vices of what is surely one of the 
world’s most important species.
Aside from the relevance to specialists, the general public should find the presentation attractive 
because of the huge interest today in marijuana. Unfortunately, society has become so specialized 
and compartmentalized that most people have limited appreciation of the importance of science to 
their lives, except when a topic like marijuana becomes sensationalized. This review of cannabis 
can serve as a vehicle for public education in the realm of science and technology. Indeed, toward 
the goal of disseminating the important information in this book to a wide audience, the presenta-
tion is user-friendly, concise, and well illustrated, in the hope that nonspecialists will find the topics 
both informative and entertaining.

Executive Summary
In past centuries, the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa) was one of the world’s most admired crops, 
furnishing a range of products often considered indispensable. In recent decades, however, exagger-
ated fear of the abuse potential of cannabis has resulted in extremely punitive and counterproductive 
suppression, not just of marijuana consumption but also of the useful industrial (nondrug) values 
of the cannabis plant and its many products. Worst of all, the search for unbiased scientific knowl-
edge has been drastically curtailed, an egregious example of how political agendas remove some 
subjects from objective examination. Additionally, human prejudice against recreational drugs in 
general and relentless condemnation of marijuana in particular have made cannabis a taboo subject. 
However, over the last half-century, society has become increasingly aware that the evil nature of 
cannabis has been overstated and that there are potentially invaluable benefits deserving explora-
tion. Very recently, the constraints limiting cannabis research have been loosened, and a tidal wave 
of research and development has been unleashed. Certainly, there are pros and cons related to the 
many ways that cannabis can be employed, and intelligent risk/benefit analysis requires knowledge. 
That knowledge is rapidly becoming overwhelming. This volume attempts to bring together very 
old and very new information that needs to be considered to best guide the development of cannabis.
Cannabis sativa is best known as the plant source of marijuana, the world’s most widely con-
sumed illicit recreational drug. However, it is also extremely useful as a source of stem fiber, edible 
seed oil, and medicinal compounds, all of which are undergoing extraordinarily promising research, 
technological applications, and business investment. Indeed, despite its capacity for harm as a rec-
reational drug, cannabis has phenomenal potential for providing new products to benefit society 
and for generating extensive employment and huge profits. Misguided policies until recently have 
prevented legitimate research of the beneficial properties of cannabis, but there is now an explosion 
of societal, scientific, and political support to reappraise, indeed remove, some of the barriers to 
usage. Unfortunately, there is also a corresponding dearth of objective analysis. Toward redressing 
the limitation of information, this book is a comprehensive reference summarizing botanical, busi-
ness, chemical, ecological, genetic, historical, horticultural, legal, and medical considerations that 
are critical for the wise advancement and management of cannabis.

Cautions
This work presents extensive information gathered from the literature, and some error, omission, 
and misinterpretation are inevitably incorporated into compilations of this type. Moreover, scien-
tific knowledge concerning the material is rapidly evolving. Liability arising directly or indirectly 
from the use of any of the information is specifically disclaimed.
The medicinal and nutritional information provided is not intended to replace the medical advice 
of trained healthcare professionals.
The economic information provided is not intended as investment advice.
Most aspects of cannabis, the subject of this book, are criminalized, albeit there is a general 
trend to reduce criminal penalties, and the world’s prison systems could not possibly house the huge 
numbers who have consumed marijuana illicitly. Nevertheless, depending on jurisdiction, those 
who deliberately or even inadvertently transgress the laws and regulations governing cannabis risk 
arrest, imprisonment, loss of employment, loss of property, and loss of standing in the community. 
The information in this book is not intended to be used in any way that contravenes the legal system 
of any jurisdiction. Indeed, given the enormous personal costs associated with becoming a victim 
of criminal prosecution, it is necessary to exercise extreme caution in any kind of association with 
cannabis.
Value judgments and opinions regarding several of the topics discussed in this book are cur-
rently the subject of contentious debate and disagreement. Indeed, intellectual freedom to analyze 
and express points of view is of greatest value precisely when issues are so controversial. While 
the book attempts to maintain a dispassionate, objective perspective, it is not possible to represent 
every viewpoint in a manner that will satisfy all, or even a majority, of interested parties. In particu-
lar, the author’s assessments regarding medical, social, ethical, commercial, and criminal aspects 
should not be regarded as necessarily reflecting the views of any government, publisher, agency, or 
individual contributing in any way to this work. Indeed, it is safe to say that no one will agree with 
everything in this book, and everyone will have different ideas about what is correct.

1 Introduction
THE CANNABIS PLANT
Cannabis sativa, best known as the source of marijuana, is the world’s most recognizable, notori-
ous, and controversial plant. As befits a species that has captured the world’s attention, it is impres-
sive in appearance (Figure 1.1). While the structure of plants may seem much simpler than that 
of animals, the architectural adaptations of C. sativa are very complex and are cleverly designed 
to carry out a wide variety of functions (Chapter 6). Cannabis plants vary enormously in height 
depending on environment and whether selected for stem fiber (the tallest kind), but are typically 
1–5 m tall. Simmonds (1976) stated that hemp has been known to grow to 12 m in height, but it 
should be kept in mind that, as discussed later, other plants called “hemp” sometimes grow to such 
heights and are often confused with C. sativa. The main stalk is erect, furrowed (especially when 
large), with a somewhat woody interior, and it may be hollow in the internodes (portions of the 
stem between the bases of the leaf stalks). Although the stem is more or less woody, the species is 
frequently referred to as an herb or forb (an herbaceous flowering plant that is not grass-like, i.e., 
not like grasses, sedges, or rushes). Both herbs and forbs are defined as lacking significant woody 
tissues, so these terms are not really accurate. As discussed in this book, in many respects, deciding 
on appropriate terminology for cannabis is contentious.
“CANNABIS”—A COMPREHENSIVE TERM
“Cannabis” in its broad sense refers to the cannabis plant, especially its psychoactive chemicals 
(employed particularly as illicit and medicinal drugs), fiber products (such as textiles, plastics, and 
dozens of construction materials), edible seed products (now in over a hundred processed foods), 
and all associated considerations. In short, cannabis is a generic term referring to all aspects of the 
plant, especially its products and how they are used.
Biologists and editors conventionally italicize scientific names, such as Homo sapiens. Italicized, 
Cannabis refers to the biological name of the plant (only one species of this genus is commonly 
recognized, C. sativa L.). Nonitalicized, “cannabis” is a generic abstraction, widely used as a noun 
and adjective and commonly (often loosely) used both for cannabis plants and/or any or all of the 
intoxicant preparations made from them. In this book, “cannabis” is employed in its broadest sense, 
as explained in the previous paragraph.
THE WIDESPREAD MISUNDERSTANDING THAT 
MARIJUANA IS “FLOWERS” OF CANNABIS SATIVA
“Herbal marijuana” is the most frequently consumed form of cannabis, both for medical and non-
medical purposes. Herbal marijuana is obviously plant material from C. sativa, but from precisely 
what botanical organs does it originate? As pointed out in Chapter 12, in the past, low-grade mari-
juana (sometimes derisively termed “ditchweed,” although this term more narrowly refers to wild-
growing low-tetrahydrocannabinol [low-THC] weedy plants) often was made up of a combination of 
foliage, twigs, “seeds” (technically one-seeded fruits called achenes), and material from the flower-
ing section of the plant. Today, only “sinsemilla” (material from the flowering part of the unfertil-
ized female plant) is commonly harvested.
Most plants have numerous flowers, and botanists employ technical terms to describe the 
ways that flowers are arranged on branches or branch systems. The term “inflorescence” refers to

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
(1) a group or cluster of flowers on an ultimate branch and/or (2) the entire branching system bear-
ing flowers. When the flowers are fertilized and develop fruits, the branching systems are termed 
“infructescences.” In many Cannabis strains, the ultimate branches bearing flowers have been 
selected to develop very congested, short branching systems bearing many flowers. These are 
the so-called “buds” of marijuana—desired because they are extremely rich in THC. “Buds” are 
technically “inflorescences”—a combination of the flowers and the ultimate small twigs of the 
branching system subtending the flowers. In the standard terminology of horticulture, “buds” are 
meristems (growing points or locations where cells divide) of stems or flowers or are embryonic 
stems, leaves, or flowers that will develop and enlarge with time. Like a number of other standard 
terms, the marijuana trade has adopted and converted the word “bud” to mean something different 
from its conventional meaning.
Marijuana is frequently referred to as the “flowers” of C. sativa. Indeed, in pre-Second-World-
War drug literature, herbal marijuana was often known by the now largely antiquated pharmaco-
logical phrase “Cannabis Flos” (literally, Latin for “cannabis flowers”). As shown in Figure 1.2, the 
term is still occasionally encountered. In common language, a flower may be broadly understood to 
be “something that grows in a garden,” but in technical botany, a flower is usually defined as a repro-
ductive structure composed of one or more of sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils. (This is a narrow 
sense botanical definition; there are broader definitions available.) Female flowers of C. sativa lack 
sepals and stamens and (as explained in Chapter 6) lack typical petals. A female flower, illustrated 
in Figure 1.3b, is virtually devoid of THC, so defining or characterizing marijuana as the flowers 
of the plant (which in fact are present) is technically erroneous. (Parenthetically, jurisdictions that 
define illicit marijuana as the flowers of the plant are subject to legal challenges, since the material 
so defined is harmless from an abuse potential perspective.)

Introduction
“Bracts” are the key component of marijuana that contributes to drug potential. Botanically, 
a “bract” is a modified or specialized leaf, especially one associated with flowers. The structures 
termed bracts in C. sativa are quite small, resembling miniature unifoliolate leaves (i.e., leaves with 
just one leaflet), and they are indeed associated with the flowers. As presented in Chapter 11, a “peri-
gonal bract” (illustrated in Figure 1.3c) covers in a cup-like fashion each female flower, and enlarges 
somewhat, becoming densely covered with tiny secretory glands that produce the bulk of the THC 
that the plant produces. (The terms “bracteole” and “perigonium” are sometimes encountered as 
synonyms of “perigonal bract” as the phrase is applied to Cannabis but are also used in different 
senses when applied to other plants.) In sinsemilla marijuana, which is produced by protecting the 
female flowers from being pollinated, the bracts remain quite small and are very densely covered 
with secretory glands. By contrast, pollinated flowers develop into “seeds” (achenes) and the peri-
gonal bract becomes much larger and the density of secretory glands is lessened considerably. In

C. sativa, in addition to the tiny perigonal bracts, the flowering axis produces tiny leaves that are 
unifoliolate (with just one leaflet; “unifoliate,” descriptive of plants with just one leaf, is incorrect) 
that are scarcely different from the perigonal bracts, and as one proceeds down from the tip toward 
the base of the branch bearing flowers (the axis of the bud), there are increasingly larger bracts that 
transition into small leaves with more than one leaflet. In the bud illustrated in Figure 1.3a, the 
green material that is visible constitutes both perigonal bracts and tiny young leaves. The smaller 
tiny leaves, like the perigonal bracts, are richly covered with tiny secretory glands, while the larger 
leaves within the bud have a lesser density of glands and so less THC on a relative concentration 
basis. As explained in Chapter 13, the larger leaves within buds are often trimmed away to make 
the THC concentration of the buds larger. To emphasize the key point in this paragraph, strictly 
speaking, marijuana (sinsemilla) is not literally “flowers,” although a small amount, perhaps about 
2%, is made up of female flowers virtually lacking THC; rather, it is THC-rich material (bracts, 
tiny leaves) associated with the flowers. The distinction made here is academic, admittedly, and 
is unlikely to change the widespread practice of referring to marijuana as flowering material. As 
pointed out by Small and Naraine (2016a), although the stigmas of the female flowers are originally 
devoid of THC, they are sticky, and gland heads rich in THC tend to fall away from the bud but are 
trapped on the stigmas, so in fact, the flowers secondarily acquire appreciable THC.
WHY CANNABIS IS CONTROVERSIAL
It hardly needs to be pointed out that cannabis is immensely controversial, accused of both deadly 
sins and marvelous virtues. It is famous (or infamous) because its chemicals have been considered to 
be the cause of considerable evil and harm by some, but of pleasure and cures by others (Figure 1.4). 
Indeed, cannabis is reminiscent of the malevolent Dr. Hyde and the saintly Mr. Jekyll—split per-
sonalities epitomizing good and evil within an individual (Small and Catling 2009). Democratic 
societies are currently struggling to evaluate just how bad and how good cannabis is. This book is 
intended to address these issues in sufficient but not overwhelming detail for the consideration of an 
informed public as well as decision makers.

Introduction
SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN CANNABIS
We humans are preoccupied with sex, which also happens to be a subject of immense importance 
for cannabis. Most animals are divided into males and females (so male and female reproductive 
cells are produced on different individuals), although some are hermaphrodites. By contrast, most 
plants produce male reproductive elements (pollen) and female cells (eggs) on the same individual. 
Cannabis sativa is among the small minority of plants following the animal rather than the plant 
reproductive pattern. Most populations are divided into plants bearing only female flowers or only 
male flowers (Figure 1.5). Male plants are termed “staminate,” so-named because the essential 
male floral organs are stamens, while female plants are termed “pistillate,” so-named because the 
essential female floral organs are pistils, the egg-containing organs. Male plants die after shedding 
pollen, whereas female plants persist after their flowers are pollinated, maturing and shedding seeds 
until killed by frost. Female plants grown in a greenhouse, or in climates lacking a cold winter, can

remain alive for years, although declining steadily in vigor. This potential longevity has led some 
to term the plants “annual or perennial depending on climate,” but it is clear that the species is 
normally an annual. Sex expression, examined in Chapter 4, has been remarkably manipulated in 
domesticated plants, generally to the extreme detriment of males. Indeed, as detailed in Chapter 4, 
femaleness has become very highly valued in cannabis plants, while males are now regarded as the 
decidedly inferior sex. Another curiosity is that, unlike most animals, sexual expression in C. sativa 
is modifiable by a variety of stresses, and it is even possible (as discussed in Chapter 4) to induce 
females to become males, and vice versa.
Cannabis sativa produces leafy branches in the early part of its seasonal life cycle, and during 
the early growth period, male and female plants are virtually indistinguishable. Most populations 
are induced to flower by shortening days in late season, the timing of floral induction being one of 
many adaptive features of the plant and a critical consideration in maximizing the productivity of 
the plant for the various purposes for which it is grown (Chapter 5).
HOW THE FOUR KINDS OF HORSES ARE SIMILAR TO 
THE FOUR KINDS OF CANNABIS SATIVA
Cannabis plants are extremely diverse, and this has generated extraordinary widespread misunder-
standing concerning the classes or categories deserving recognition, not just by the general public 
but also among professionals in numerous disciplines. It is no exaggeration to say that both the 
popular literature (notably as reflected by information on the Web) and the professional literature 
(particularly scientific publications) present highly confused and confusing interpretations of how 
variation among cannabis plants is structured and what terminology is appropriate. The root of 
misunderstanding of variability in Cannabis is that humans, not nature, have generated the most 
conspicuous differences. The topic is examined in depth in Chapter 18, but before considering the 
rather voluminous information in this book, it is important for clarity of understanding to appreciate 
the four principal kinds of plant that are significant to human welfare. These are (1) “wild” weedy 
plants, (2) plants selected for valuable fiber in the stems, (3) plants selected for edible oil–containing 
seeds, and (4) plants selected for intoxicating and medicinal drugs. The variation pattern exhibited 
by domesticated kinds of Cannabis is paralleled by many other examples of how humans have 
enslaved wild species, domesticating them (changing them genetically) into different utilitarian 
classes with characteristics uniquely suited to different purposes. As noted in the following discus-
sion, just as Cannabis is composed of four basic economic classes, similarly, there are four func-
tional groupings of horses.
Although there are numerous horse breeds today, three main types have been recognized, dif-
fering in ways that humans have chosen: heavy horses, light horses, and ponies. Heavy horses (also 
termed draft, draught, and dray horses) have strong bodies, broad backs, rounded withers (between 
the shoulder blades), and short thick legs—all features maximizing ability to pull large wagons 
(Figure 1.6a) and plow fields. Light horses (riding horses) have long bodies with backs that are 
narrow enough for humans to ride comfortably and long legs that stride easily. This class includes 
quarter horses, thoroughbreds (Figure 1.6b), and miniature horses. Ponies (often confused with 
miniature horses) usually have notably thick manes, tails, and coats; relatively small heads; thick 
necks; and short legs. As exemplified by the Shetland pony, ponies are commonly used as pets, rid-
ing horses for children, and horses for small wagons (Figure 1.6c). Numerous domesticated plants 
and animals have been so drastically altered by selection that they cannot survive without the assis-
tance of humans. Domesticated kinds of C. sativa and domesticated horses, however, are frequently 
very hardy, and when they escape to the wild, they are often capable of living on their own (Figure 
1.6d). Just as horses can be divided into the four classes discussed in this paragraph, C. sativa can 
be similarly divided into three domesticated and one wild class, as discussed next.
Chapter 18 provides an extensive analysis of the theory and practice of classification of liv-
ing things with particular reference to C. sativa. As discussed there, biological classification of

exclusively wild plants and animals is based only on natural genetic relationships. However, clas-
sification of living things that have been substantially altered by humans is often also based on utili-
tarian considerations, particularly the ways that they have been genetically modified for particular 
purposes. Just as domesticated horses exhibit three discernibly different kinds selected for different 
purposes, as well as wild (“ruderal”) free-living populations, an analogous pattern is found among 
cannabis plants. The many different kinds of plant in C. sativa can be grouped into four basic cat-
egories, the first three of which include cultivated plants that have been selected for one of three 
economic products:
 
1. Fiber from the main stalk (employed for textiles, cordage, and numerous recent applications).
 
2. Oilseed (oil-rich seed employed for human food, livestock feed, nutritional supplements, 
industrial oils, and occasionally as a biofuel).
 
3. Psychoactive drugs from the flowering parts (used mostly illicitly for recreation and more 
recently legally as medicinals).
 
4. “Wild” (weedy) plants that have escaped from cultivation and grow independently in 
nature.
WILD PLANTS
Cannabis sativa is very widely encountered outside of cultivation growing as a weed (Figure 1.7; 
Chapter 3), and the existence of such “wild” plants is the basis for considerable arguments con-
cerning appropriate classification (Chapter 18). The word “wild” can refer in a general way to 
plants or animals reproducing in nature without human care. However, the term is used in several 
different precise senses, as detailed in Chapter 18, and it is important to understand the sense in 
which some cannabis plants are “wild.” Wolves and feral dogs can both be termed “wild,” but 
wolves represent the ancestors of dogs, while feral dogs are merely escapes, more or less iden-
tical to pet dogs, although often extensively hybridized. The Australian dingo, however, repre-
sents an escaped dog that has reevolved adaptations to living in the wild. Accordingly, “wild” can 
mean (1) groups (like wolves) never altered by humans, (2) groups altered by humans that have

Introduction
merely escaped (like feral dogs), and (3) groups altered by humans that have escaped and reevolved 
characteristics more suited to wild existence. Occasionally, one also encounters (4) “wolfdogs”—
hybrids between wolves and dogs, which sometimes transfer genes between the two. As discussed 
in Chapter 18, “wild” cannabis plants appear to belong to groups 2, 3, and 4, but there do not seem 
to be genuinely wild plants that have not been changed genetically by humans. The world’s so-
called wild cannabis plants are likely extensively interbred with cultivated plants, and it appears 
that the ancient wild ancestor of C. sativa that existed in pre-Neolithic times (i.e., prior to 10,000 
BC) is no longer extant (see Chapter 18).
As detailed in Chapter 3, plants of C. sativa growing outside of cultivation have distinctive adap-
tations, which are not present in domesticated plants. As discussed in Chapter 17, the genes that 
adapt wild plants to the stress of wild existence are very valuable for improving cultivated forms 
of C. sativa. Unfortunately, for decades, there have been enthusiastic, expensive, and short-sighted 
efforts to eradicate wild plants in North America, although their potential to be used as illicit drugs 
is insignificant.
Law enforcement personnel in the United States commonly use the phrase “ditch weed” for wild-
growing C. sativa. Because almost all wild-growing plants in North America cannot produce intoxi-
cation, all poorly intoxicating plants are now often referred to as ditch weed. The slang term “weed” 
is the most popular of the dozens of terms used informally to refer to one or both of marijuana and 
marijuana plants. In the Netherlands, one encounters the term “Nederweed” (“Netherweed”), and 
in Europe, one finds “Euroweed.”
FIBER PLANTS
“Hemp” usually refers to C. sativa plants used for fiber and also is the term employed for the fiber 
obtained from the stalk (i.e., the main stem). (As discussed next, when hemp is grown for oilseed, it 
is distinguished as “oilseed hemp” or “hempseed.”) In past centuries, hemp was a staple resource for 
both civilian and military purposes, used mostly for textiles and cordage. The shipping industry for 
many centuries relied on hemp products (Figure 1.8). Based mostly on fiber, hemp was once touted, 
rather unrealistically, as “the new billion dollar crop” (Popular Mechanics 1938), with the claim 
that it “can be used to produce more than 25,000 products, ranging from dynamite to Cellophane.” 
Nevertheless, C. sativa cultivation for fiber almost ceased in Western countries after the Second 
World War. However, as noted later, in the last several decades, there has been a resurgence of inter-
est of fiber applications, mostly for nontraditional uses.
At present, there are only small, niche markets for the production of hemp fiber for various 
purposes. Traditional usage of the fiber for clothing, cordage, and paper continues, but these prod-
ucts are very expensive and appeal to a very small clientele. However, the hemp industry has been 
reinvigorated by new fiber-based products (Roulac 1997; Bouloc et al. 2013). Both the outer (bark, 
phloem) long fibers and the short internal (hurds, wood) fibers are now being employed in specialty 
pulp products and composites. These usages include fiberboard, insulation, pressed fiber products, 
masonry products (concrete, stucco, plaster, and tiles), carpets, straw-bale construction materials, 
livestock bedding, and a very wide range of plastics, as detailed in Chapter 7. The automotive indus-
try has particularly pioneered the development of pressed fiber and molded plastic components. The 
considerable rot-resistance of the fiber is being exploited in geotextile products, such as landscap-
ing fabric. The usage of hemp for these new fiber applications has been primarily in Europe, and 
subsidization was important in establishing the new hemp-related industries. Chapter 7 presents an 
extensive discussion of fiber aspects related to C. sativa.
Other SO-Called “hempS”
The name “hemp” can be confusing. It usually refers to C. sativa, but the term has been applied to 
dozens of other species representing at least 22 genera other than Cannabis, often prominent fiber

crops. Montgomery (1954) listed over 30 “hemp names.” So-called hemps include ambari hemp 
(deccan hemp, best known as kenaf, Hibiscus cannabinus L.), Manila hemp (abaca, Musa textilis 
Née), Mauritius hemp (Furcraea foetida (L.) Haw.), roselle hemp (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), New 
Zealand hemp (Phormium tenax J.R. Forst. & G. Forst.), sisal hemp (Agave sisalina Perrine), and 
sunn hemp (Crotolaria juncea L.).
“IndIan hemp”
Especially confusing is the phrase “Indian hemp,” which has been used both for intoxicating Asian 
drug varieties of C. sativa (so-called C. indica Lamarck of India), for jute (Corchorus capsularis L., 
also called Bengal hemp, Calcutta hemp, and Madras Hemp; see Ash 1948), and for Apocynum 
cannabinum L. (also known as American hemp as well as by other names), which was used by 
North American Indians as a fiber plant (see Figure 2.3).
OILSEED PLANTS
Cannabis sativa is employed as a source of a multipurpose fixed (i.e., nonvolatile) vegetable oil, 
obtained from the seeds (technically fruits called “achenes”; Figure 1.9, left). As documented in

Introduction
Chapter 8, the seeds of C. sativa in recent decades have become an important source of edible oil. 
The seeds have traditionally been called “hempseed,” and this expression has been used also for 
varieties of C. sativa grown especially for the oilseed. Although oilseed use was relatively unim-
portant historically compared to fiber applications, the commercial products made from hempseed 
have much greater significance and potential today than the fiber usages. The seeds of C. sativa 
are increasingly being recognized as a legitimate source for medicinals, nutraceuticals (nutritional 
extractives), and functional (i.e., nutritionally fortified) foods (Figure 1.9, right). Indeed, while 
“medical marijuana” is widely (with justification) held to have impressive therapeutic potential, as 
discussed in Chapter 8, “medical hempseed” also has remarkable therapeutic capacities.
INTOXICATING DRUG PLANTS
Forms of C. sativa producing elevated amounts of intoxicating chemicals were selected, particu-
larly over the last thousand years in Asia (Figure 1.10), where the consumption of inebriating drug 
preparations (such as marijuana and hashish) have been consumed for ritualistic, religious, and 
hedonistic purposes. During the last century, the usage of marijuana has increased to the point 
that cannabis has become the world’s leading illegal recreational drug. The chemistry and varia-
tion patterns of the cannabinoids (particularly the chief intoxicant THC) are examined in detail in 
Chapter 11, and nonmedical drug usage is documented in Chapter 12. The latter chapter provides 
extensive information on how recreational cannabis drugs are prepared and used, as well as the 
resulting physiological and psychological effects. While this information may disturb those unac-
quainted with cannabis drugs, it is widely available and mostly familiar to a substantial proportion 
of people, especially the young, and is needed to understand the possible associated harms, which 
are examined extensively in Chapter 12.
GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CANNABIS PLANTS
As explained in Chapter 18, when essentially all individuals of a group can interbreed freely (as 
within C. sativa and within Homo sapiens), it is of interest to determine whether, despite this ability to

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
combine genes freely, there are nevertheless genetically distinctive subgroups. The existence of sub-
groups can be of practical interest. For example, it is well known that certain racial or ethnic groups 
of human beings tend to suffer from certain inherited diseases. For economic plants like Cannabis, 
the genes present in different subgroups can be invaluable for breeding improved crop cultivars 
(Chapter 17). A chief reason why subgroups develop in groups within which interbreeding can occur 
freely is geographical separation: when subgroups are too distant from each other to interbreed, and 
especially when they are in places with different climates and other stresses, they are often free 
to diverge genetically. Indeed, both in cannabis plants and in humans, it is obvious that subgroups 
developed in historical times. The genetic subgroupings of C. sativa that recent research suggests 
deserve recognition are discussed in detail in Chapter 18. Just how these genetic subgroupings are 
related to the utilitarian groups discussed earlier (fiber plants, oilseed plants, marijuana plants, and 
weeds) and what classification and nomenclature are appropriate are complicated issues, summa-
rized in Figure 1.11 and explained in detail in Chapter 18.
THE CRIMINALIZATION AND SUPPRESSION OF CANNABIS
Cannabis sativa is infamous as the world’s most widely utilized illicit plant. Because cannabis 
has been considered to be a leading drug of abuse, it has been seriously criminalized (Figure 1.12) 
since the Second World War, and almost all research and economic development—both drug and 
nondrug aspects—were suppressed for most of the twentieth century. After the Second World War, 
C. sativa became the leading illicitly cultivated black market crop in the Western World, with 
law enforcement dedicating huge efforts to eradicating the plants wherever they were discovered 
(Figure 1.13). Most scientific investigations authorized in Western countries were either forensic 
studies to aid law enforcement or medical and social research specifically intended to document and 
reduce harmful effects. As presented in Chapter 15, criminalization of cannabis has been associated 
with enormous law enforcement costs and social upheaval.
There have been many casualties of the “war on drugs” that has been waged with unusual feroc-
ity against marijuana for decades. Science itself has been a principal casualty. For most of the last

Introduction
century, the stigma attached to “narcotics” was so severely associated with marijuana that scientists 
risked their careers attempting to initiate studies of virtually any aspect of cannabis, except its 
harmfulness. It is well to recall the martyrdom of the illustrious Russian crop geneticist N.I. Vavilov 
(1887–1943), who carried out scientific studies and made invaluable seed collections of C. sativa. 
As noted in Chapter 17, attempting to present scientific truth to power (the dictator Joseph Stalin) 
resulted in his imprisonment (Figure 1.14) and death. In democracies, it is not unreasonable for the 
elected governance to restrict or even prevent taxpayer-funded scientific research. More controver-
sial, but at least debatable, is prohibition of research that bears on ethical issues (such as human 
reproduction). What must not be prevented is the search for truth that contradicts ignorant dogma, 
as the sorry history of cannabis demonstrates.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
One of the tragic but much less obvious consequences of the criminalization of cannabis has 
been the short-sighted destruction of seed collections of C. sativa acquired by agriculture depart-
ments (mostly in North America) and the directives to refuse additional collection. As noted in 
Chapter 17, “seed banks” are collections of seeds, particularly of crop plants, and represent value 
considerably exceeding all of the monetary holdings of conventional banks. It is of the highest prior-
ity that the “germplasm resources” of C. sativa be conserved for the future welfare of the world, in 
the same way that other valuable crops like wheat, barley, corn, and potato are maintained.
THE RELEGITIMIZATION OF CANNABIS
By the last decade of the twentieth century, several developments contributed to a surge of scien-
tific and technological development of C. sativa. First, in many countries (with the conspicuous

Introduction
exception of the United States), after a half century of prohibition of cultivation, there was a 
resurrection of production of the plant for nondrug purposes (Chapters 7 through 10). Second, 
nondrug hemp has acquired a reputation for being phenomenally beneficial for the environment 
and has become a leading symbol of sustainable agriculture (Chapter 16). Third, in much of 
Western society, there has been a growing tolerance of the extremely widespread recreational 
use of marijuana, as reflected by a romantic, idealized image in the media, less enthusiastic law 
enforcement, and even de facto decriminalization in some jurisdictions (Chapter 12). Fourth, 
there has been a substantial and increasing usage of marijuana prescribed for medical purposes 
(Chapter 13).
As noted in the following, decriminalization of cannabis for (1) industrial hemp, (2) medical 
marijuana, and (3) recreational marijuana has occurred or is occurring in many jurisdictions, the 
result of sociological, philosophical, political, and legal developments—complex and very conten-
tious subjects which are examined only briefly in this book.
THE DECRIMINALIZATION AND RESURRECTION 
OF INDUSTRIAL (NONINTOXICATING) CANNABIS
By the middle of the twentieth century, the nondrug fiber and oilseed uses of C. sativa were 
widely viewed as obsolete, with no reasonable potential for legitimate development. Moreover, 
the issues of recreational and medical uses of Cannabis made it very difficult to rationally con-
sider the redevelopment of industrial hemp for purposes that everyone should agree are not harm-
ful. The extent of hostility to even harmless forms of C. sativa was indicated by remarkable 
limitations of human rights in democratic countries. For example, in Queensland, Australia, it 
was illegal to simply publish or possess information on growing industrial hemp before amend-
ments to the Drugs Misuse Act 1986 were proclaimed on September 27, 2002, by the Queensland 
Parliament (Olsen 2004).
By the beginning of the twenty-first century, most Western countries witnessed the reintroduc-
tion of cultivation of nonintoxicating hemp, after at least a half century of total prohibition. The 
cultivars authorized are considered to be safe enough to be grown (generally under license) for the 
production of fiber and oilseed products. The delay in reauthorizing hemp cultivation was caused by 
fear that acceptance of the new crop would (1) be interpreted by the public as de facto acceptance of 
the legitimacy of all aspects of the species C. sativa, (2) act as a stepping stone to the legalization 
of marijuana, (3) impede the war on drugs, and (4) require costly monitoring to ensure that licensed 
crops are treated according to regulations.
When it became evident during the last decade of the twentieth century that hemp cultivation 
was being promoted, several economic analyses were conducted in various countries (Riddlestone 
et al. 1994; Gehl 1995; McNulty 1995; Ehrensing 1998; Kraenzel et al. 1998; Marcus 1998; Pinfold 
Consulting 1998; Thompson et al. 1998; Johnson 1999). These analyses are more or less obsoles-
cent, since hemp cultivation has actually been revived in many countries, and the resulting hemp 
products have been tested in the marketplace for the last two decades. Fortenbery and Bennett 
(2004) is a more recent analysis of fiber potential but is rather discouraging of future development. 
Robbins et al. (2013) examines the potential in Kentucky, and Johnson (2015) analyzes the potential 
in the United States; these reviews are much more optimistic. Hemp is now grown commercially in 
about three dozen countries, with the notable exception of the United States (although this seems 
about to change). Earlier economic analyses generally failed to foresee that hempseed rather than 
fiber applications would become the most promising aspect of industrial hemp development. A vari-
ety of imaginative, innovative hemp fiber and hempseed products have appeared in the marketplace 
in the last two decades and have provided considerable impetus to increasingly promising industries 
(Small and Marcus 2002). Chapters 7 to 10 examine the extraordinary qualities, applications, and 
potentials of industrial hemp.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
“hemp” vS. “marIjuana”
As has been noted, C. sativa has been selected primarily for three different purposes: fiber (from 
the bark of the stem), edible seeds and seed oil, and intoxicating preparations (mostly from the 
flowering parts of the female plants). The common names “hemp” and “marijuana” (much less 
commonly spelled marihuana) have been applied loosely to all three classes, although historically, 
“hemp” has been used primarily for the fiber kind of plant as well as for its harvested fiber, and 
“marijuana” for the drug kind as well as for drug preparations made from it. The industries con-
cerned with the nonintoxicating uses for fiber and oilseed have been at pains to distance themselves 
from the marijuana uses of C. sativa because of the stigma long attached to illicit drugs. Great 
efforts are made to point out that “hemp is not marijuana.” The key phrase that has been used to dis-
tinguish plants authorized for noneuphoric drug uses (both fiber and oilseed) is “industrial hemp.” 
Industrial hemp is now commonly employed to designate fiber and oilseed cultivars of C. sativa 
with very limited content of the intoxicating chemical THC.
THE DECRIMINALIZATION AND RESURRECTION OF MEDICAL CANNABIS
As noted in Chapter 13, cannabis has been extensively employed medically since ancient times. The 
illegality of cannabis during most of the twentieth century tragically retarded research and develop-
ment of therapies. Ironically, black market marijuana used by thousands of people suffering from 
various conditions made it apparent that cannabis can alleviate symptoms and led to heroic efforts 
by patients, doctors, social activists, and lawyers to make medical marijuana available. Currently, 
medical marijuana has been authorized in several jurisdictions, and its use is rapidly expanding 
in Western countries. In the last several decades, there have been great advances in the scientific 
understanding of how cannabis affects human physiology, and new therapeutic products and tech-
nologies are either under development, being tested, or in some cases already accepted as useful. 
The literature on medical aspects has become extremely voluminous, and by no means is there 
agreement on the value of cannabis for treating particular conditions. Indeed, there is quite ferocious 
debate about the wisdom of employing medical marijuana for most medical issues. Chapter 13, by 
far the largest chapter in this book, reviews in detail the most recently available evidence bearing 
on the wisdom of employing cannabis for over two dozen illnesses.
Regardless of majority evaluation by the medical profession, in some jurisdictions medical 
 marijuana has been remarkably commercialized, with the development of so-called medical dis-
pensaries that are more reminiscent of supermarkets than clinics (Figure 1.15) and some physi-
cians supplying medical marijuana in a manner reminiscent of street drug dealers. These unsavory 
developments —reflecting failures of adequate regulatory planning—are discussed in Chapter 15.
THE DECRIMINALIZATION AND RESURRECTION 
OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS
Cannabis generally remains highly criminalized, particularly in some Asian countries, where it 
can result in capital punishment. Most of the Western World prohibits the recreational use of mari-
juana, but legalization has occurred in Uruguay and several U.S. states and is expected in other 
areas, particularly in the Americas. De facto legality of recreational marijuana has been the case 
in the Netherlands for decades (Figure 1.16), although not officially accepted. In democratic coun-
tries, there has been a general softening of penalties, or at least of prosecution, coinciding with 
increasing public tolerance of illicit usage. However, there remains considerable opposition and 
uncertainty about whether and how to modify current restrictions regarding recreational marijuana. 
Complicating the issue, investment in a recreational marijuana industry is widely viewed as poten-
tially immensely profitable and business forces are driving developments. These issues and factors 
bearing on wise regulatory policies are examined at length in Chapter 15.

Introduction
BENEFIT/HARM ANALYSIS OF THE MANY WAYS THAT CANNABIS IS USED
Cannabis sativa is remarkable—indeed incredible—with respect to the range of useful products 
it produces and the myriad ways these commodities can be employed (Figures 1.17 and 1.18). 
However, because it has been possible to develop various industries and products only for a limited 
period, their potential remains to be explored and evaluated. This book is concerned with examin-
ing in detail the current state of knowledge of the comparative merits and disadvantages of can-
nabis. Several of the chapters present a benefit/harm analysis of the individual ways that cannabis is 
employed—for fiber-based goods (Chapter 7), oilseed products (Chapter 8), essential oil (Chapter 9), 
minor items (Chapter 10), nonmedical drug uses (Chapter 12), medicinal applications (Chapter 13), 
and environmental enhancement (Chapter 16).
THE INTERFACE OF CANNABIS SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
If it were not for the notorious recreational drug usage of marijuana, there would be very limited 
interest in regulation of the plant and its products, and its potentials would have been well explored 
by now. But there is much that has been evaluated only recently, and even more that has not been 
examined at all. This volume presents an up-to-date evaluation of the “facts” about cannabis, partic-
ularly the pros and cons of employing it for various industrial and medical purposes. The following

chapters summarize scientific knowledge about various aspects of the subject. However, it is well to 
keep in mind that human beings consider not only scientific knowledge but also whether the prob-
able results of applying that knowledge are, on balance, favorable. Put simply, will the inevitable 
harm from reducing current restrictions on cannabis outweigh the potential good?
Automobile speed limits provide an instructive parallel (World Health Organization 2014). An 
increase in average speed of 1 km/h increases fatalities by 4% to 5%. A person hit by a car traveling 
at 50 km/h has an 85% chance of dying, but if struck by that same car at 30 km/h, the risk is only 
5%. In high-income countries, speed contributes to about 30% of deaths on the road. In recognition 
of the dangers of automobile speed, there are many mechanisms that are employed—education, 
police traffic enforcement, speed zones, speed traps, speed bumps, and road designs that separate 
cars from pedestrians and bicyclists. Inevitably, grandstanding politicians succeed in lowering traf-
fic to a crawl at intersections where a child has been killed by an irresponsible driver, and certainly, 
protection of vulnerable neighborhoods must be of special concern. But in the final analysis, it is 
human psychology on a much broader scale that is most determinative of how fast drivers go and 
indeed why people obey any law. In general, people obey laws for two reasons: (1) to avoid legal

consequences and sanctions and (2) because the laws are perceived to possess legitimacy (Tyler 
1990). In the case of marijuana, current laws are widely disrespected and disobeyed, with enormous 
financial and personal costs to society. Just as driving speed limits need to be determined with a 
view to what the majority will voluntarily honor, even in the face of some inevitable harm, so public 
policy regarding cannabis needs to be revised in recognition not only of “the facts” but also evolv-
ing public opinion.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• Tracing the origins of the names for plants that have been used since prehistory is difficult, 
and this is especially so for cannabis. The earliest name for the cannabis plant could be the 
Sanscrit sana, meaning a hollow reed-like plant or cane, the name applied perhaps because 
the stem is often hollow. Corresponding to this is the Persian canna and kannap, hence the 
Arabian cannab, a small reed or cane; the Greek kanna and kannabis, a reed and anything 
made from it; and the Latin cannabis, from canna, a reed or cane, which led to the genus 
name Cannabis.
• The origin of the English word “hemp” is obscure. It appears to have arisen from the 
old Latin hanapus and the Old High German hanaf, referring to a bowl or basket. This

corresponds with the English “hamper,” meaning a hemp bag or wicker basket. It has 
been contended that both the genus name Cannabis and the word hemp are based on 
a language of Central Asia or the Near East (see previous discussion). While “hemp” 
seems to be quite unrelated to “cannabis,” it may have resulted from a process called 
the Gothonic sound-shift, whereby there is a substitution of h for k and of f or p for b in 
Teutonic languages.
• It is commonly assumed that the term “marijuana” is derived from the (Mexican) 
Spanish mariguangot (perhaps related to the Portuguese maran guango), meaning “intoxi-
cant,” or from the Mexican/Spanish slang Maria y Juana, for “Mary Jane” (Piper 2005). 
The Spanish for cannabis is cañamo, which seems close enough to the English mari-
juana, but it has also been contended that the derivation of “marijuana” is obscure. 
“Marijuana” was mentioned in ballads sung by the prominent Mexican revolutionary 
general Pancho Villa and his men in the 1890s, popularizing the term. The American 
newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (1863–1951) was known for his dislike of 
Mexicans, and he further popularized the word in his newspaper chain in the 1930s as 
a means of criticizing them. According to one conspiracy theory, Hearst exercised his 
influence against hemp cultivation because he owned vast timber holdings, which fed 
the paper industry, and he was concerned that should hemp be used to produce paper, 
he would lose financially. Marijuana was corrupted to “MaryJane,” a name that still is 
occasionally mentioned.

Introduction
• Marijuana was sometimes called Mezzrole, after Milton “Mezz” Mezzrow, a musician. He 
moved to Harlem in 1929, where he sold marijuana cigarettes, as recorded in his autobiog-
raphy Really the Blues.
• “Pot,” slang for marijuana, is occasionally used as a name for the marijuana plant. One 
possible derivation is that “pot” is the shortened form of the Mexican/Spanish potiguaya, 
meaning marijuana.
• “Hashish,” also spelled hasheesh or haschisch, is a concentrated, highly intoxicating form 
of the resin of Cannabis. The word seems to be derived from Arabic, meaning “herbage.”
• “Neosemanticisms” are old words given new meanings. Examples are dope, grass, herb, 
skunk, tea, and weed, all of which have been applied to marijuana.
• In Mandarin Chinese, the way that a word is pronounced (inflected) gives it different 
meanings. For example, the word ma can mean mother, scold, horse, or hemp. This obser-
vation led to a team of University College London researchers, headed by Sophie Scott, to 
overturn the long-held theory that language is handled only in the left temporal lobe of the 
brain, as has long been known for the brains of native English speakers. Using magnetic 
resonance imaging, which indicates brain cell activity, it was found that Mandarin speak-
ers do use the left temporal lobe, but also use the right temporal lobe, normally associated 
with music.
• There are dozens of species with an epithet (the second word in scientific names) like 
 cannabinus, indicative of similarity with C. sativa, but the resemblance is always super-
ficial (note Figure 1.19). Many plants have leaves with an odd number of leaflets with saw-
tooth edges, the leaflets palmately arranged (arising independently from the top of the leaf 
stalk), and these tend to mislead many into thinking that they are viewing a marijuana plant.

2 Prehuman and Early 
History of Cannabis sativa
THE FAMILY TREE AND PREHUMAN ANTIQUITY OF CANNABIS SATIVA
Cannabis sativa is an angiosperm—a member of the flowering plants that dominate terrestrial parts 
of Earth. Although there is some evidence of an older origin, most fossil evidence demonstrates that 
flowering plants appeared at least by the Lower Cretaceous geological period, about 125 million 
years ago, and were diversifying into modern plant families by the Middle Cretaceous, 100 million 
years ago. The Cannabaceae family traditionally has been defined as comprised of two genera, 
Cannabis and Humulus (Small 1978a). Grudzinskaya (1988) added the fossil genus Humulopsis to 
the Cannabaceae and split Humulus into two genera (although only Humulus is currently accepted). 
Humulus species are vines and easily distinguished from Cannabis. However, the fruits (achenes) 
are very similar and could be confused with each other. Older texts commonly use the obsolete 
orthography Cannabinaceae and Cannabiaceae for the family (Miller 1970). Recent molecular evi-
dence indicates that the family is best considered as composed of about 10 genera (Sytsma et al. 
2002; Yang et al. 2013; Figure 2.1). McPartland and Guy (2004a), on the basis of parasite relation-
ships of Cannabis and related families, suggested that the Cannabaceae lineage evolved no earlier 
than 34 million years ago. Except for pollen grains, fossils tracing back millions of years when 
C. sativa first evolved are lacking, and its age of origin has not been determined with accuracy.
THE INCREDIBLY PARALLEL HISTORIES OF CANNABIS 
AND ITS CLOSEST RELATIVE, HUMULUS (HOP)
The common hop Humulus lupulus (Figure 2.2), the closest relative of Cannabis, is a remarkable 
plant with numerous uses (DeLyser and Kasper 1994). (Note that “hop” refers to the plant, while 
“hops” refers to its fruits [cones] employed to flavor beer.) The divergence of the genus Cannabis 
from its sister genus Humulus has been estimated on the basis of molecular data to have occurred 
approximately 21 million years ago (Yang et al. 2013; Divashuk et al. 2014). Because of the genetic 
closeness, hop provides a standard of comparison. The relationship of the common hop to humans 
is astonishingly parallel to the relationship of C. sativa to humans. As detailed in the following, 
both have numerous qualities preadapting and predisposing them to being developed by people for 
a wide range of similar products and purposes. This parallelism is no accident; it is deterministic, 
reflecting how close genetic relationship predisposes related plant species to being domesticated in 
similar ways—the “homologous series” of Vavilov (Kupzow 1975).
• Both C. sativa and H. lupulus are commonly found beside streams and rivers, their seeds 
seemingly distributed by water movement.
• Both C. sativa and H. lupulus have numerous small secretory glands producing a resin, but 
while the aliphatic acids of the hop plant resin provide flavor for legal intoxicants (beer and 
ale), the intoxicant THC of the marijuana plant is mostly illegal for recreational intoxication.
• Like hemp, hop stems contain considerable fiber and have been used in making paper and 
twine. The stems were also once used in basketry and wickerwork.
• For intoxicant purposes, both hops and marijuana are usually grown in the absence of 
males. Seedless hop cones are the counterpart of marijuana “buds.” Highest quality buds 
and hops are both grown vegetatively (as clones).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
• The tiny secretory glands of C. sativa that synthesize the intoxicant chemicals of the plant 
are harvested (as “trichomes,” “pollen,” “crystal,” or “hashish powder” as discussed in 
Chapter 12) and used as an extremely concentrated form of cannabis. Similarly, the tiny 
secretory glands of hop are harvested, often using similar techniques (Bishop 1966; Rigby 
2000), and marketed commercially as a medicinal product.
• The early stages of biosynthesis of the flavoring chemicals of H. lupulus bear similarities 
to those that produce the intoxicant chemicals of C. sativa (Raharjo et al. 2004).
• Cannabis and Humulus can be grafted to each other (Crombie and Crombie 1975).
• Like marijuana, the consumption of hops was once illegal: In England about 1500, after 
learning of how well hops preserved beer in continental Europe, British brewers started 
adding hops to ale (sweet beer made without hops), turning it into bitter beer. Henry VIII 
(1491–1547), responding to a petition to ban hop, described as “a wicked weed that would 
endanger the people,” outlawed the use of hop by brewers. His son, Edward VI (1537–
1553), rescinded the ban in 1552.
• Like cannabis, in the nineteenth century, hops were an ingredient in many patent medi-
cines. One of these was “hop bitters,” composed of hops in 30% alcohol. Its advertising 
slogan was “Take hop bitters three times a day, and you will have no doctor bills to pay.”
• Like some cannabinoids of cannabis that under some condition produce sedation (discussed 
in Chapter 13), hops have been found to have sedative chemicals including the volatile alcohol 
dimethylvinyl carbinol (Small 2016). The terpene myrcene is prominent in both Cannabis

Prehuman and Early History of Cannabis sativa
and Humulus, and as noted in Chapter 9, myrcene-rich marijuana is thought to be exception-
ally sedative. There is a long tradition of using hops as a sedative, including putting the cones 
in pillows and planting hops beside bedrooms to encourage sleep. The sedative value of hops 
led to it being used as a cure for “uncontrolled sexual desires and a quarrelsome nature.” In 
present-day Germany, hops are part of sleep preparations (Wichtl 2004).
• Like many chemicals in Cannabis, hops are rich in antibiotic compounds. Several hop 
constituents are very effective against gram-positive bacteria, which may explain why hop 
essences were once commonly used to treat tuberculosis patients.
• Hop cones and hemp seeds are employed in food and both contain compounds with con-
siderable antioxidant effects. Antioxidants protect against substances called free radicals, 
generated during metabolism, which are thought to worsen a range of diseases, including 
heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. In the case of cannabis, several of the cannabi-
noids are antioxidants, as well as such components as vitamin E in the seeds. In hops, the 
health-promoting antioxidants include prenylated flavonoids, which are accordingly found 
in beer. Unfortunately, to maximize health benefits, one would have to drink 450 L (about 
1000 American pints) of beer daily. No one has calculated how much cannabis consump-
tion is needed to realize benefits from its antioxidants.
• It has often been suggested that hops are intoxicating, like marijuana. This may be 
partly due to the peddling by British merchants in the nineteenth century of a substance 
they called hopeine, alleged to be a narcotic derived from the finest wild American 
hops. In fact, it was a mixture of an aromatic oil and morphine. Many have been tempted 
to  smoke hop leaves, although they are devoid of the mood-altering chemicals  of 
marijuana.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE EARLY HISTORICAL 
ASSOCIATION OF CANNABIS AND PEOPLE
Extinct genera (such as Australopithecus and Paranthropus) connect the human genus Homo to the 
other great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans). Extinct species of the genus Homo are thought 
to have evolved less than three million years ago, while anatomically modern humans (Homo sapi-
ens) may be less than 200,000 years of age. Given the recentness of human existence, it is obvious 
that C. sativa is much older, and clearly, the early evolution of the plant occurred in the absence of 
selective pressures by people. It is conceivable that some of the extinct species related to modern 
humans discovered the useful properties of Cannabis. However, cultural artefacts and fossilized 
remains of C. sativa (except for pollen grains) extend back at most for about 10,000 years in Eurasia 
(Fleming and Clarke 1998), and the older the evidence, the less reliable it is.
Agriculture, which began as long ago as 11,000 BC in some places (Hancock 2012), is the foun-
dation of civilization. Of the thousands of plant species that humans have used for various purposes, 
only a few dozen have been critical to the advancement of civilization, and C. sativa is one of these. 
Indeed, it is one of the most ancient of crops. The earliest archaeological evidence for human use 
of the plant has been speculated to be hemp strands in clay pots from tombs as old as 10,000 BC 
(Kung 1959; Chang 1968), although this interpretation is doubtful. Cannabis may have been har-
vested by the Chinese 8500 years ago (Schultes and Hofmann 1980), but it should be kept in mind 
that harvesting could have been from wild-growing plants. Cannabis has certainly been deliberately 
grown for at least 6000 years (Fleming and Clarke 1998). As with many major crops that trace to 
very early times, the early history of C. sativa is poorly known because it was cultivated and used 
well before the appearance of writing.
LOCATION OF THE PREHUMAN DISTRIBUTION RANGE
Cannabis sativa is widely regarded as indigenous to temperate, western or central Asia, but perhaps 
as far east as eastern Asia (Li 1974). However, no precise area has been identified where the spe-
cies occurred before it began its association with humans. De Candolle (1885), the first authorita-
tive student of the biogeography of crop plants, speculated that the ancestral area was the southern 
Caspian region. Other authors (e.g., Walter 1938; Sharma 1979) have suggested that the plant is 
native to Siberia, China, or the Himalayas. Piomelli and Russo (2016) stated, “Cannabis originated 
in Central Asia and perhaps the Himalayan foothills.” Certainly, the plant is of Old World origin 
and in prehistorical times could have naturally occupied many areas across the breadth of Asia, as 
evidenced by the present success of wild-growing (ruderal) plants, which are widespread in Asia.
Fossilized pollen grains of C. sativa that are preserved in sediments of lakes and bogs have some 
potential for discerning ancient distribution areas of the species. However, the grains of C. sativa 
and H. lupulus are quite difficult to distinguish (Fleming and Clarke 1998), and wild populations of 
both species frequently occur near streams and rivers, making it difficult to identify which species 
left pollen deposits in wetlands such as lakes and bogs where pollen is often preserved.
As discussed later, there are discernible areas in Eurasia where C. sativa has been selected for 
fiber or marijuana (Figure 2.7), but it is well known from the study of other crops that such areas 
may represent secondary centers of selection—i.e., they were transported from an original, often 
quite distant indigenous area (Harlan 1951).
The chief reason that there is uncertainty regarding the primeval location of C. sativa is that for 
at least the last 6000 years, it has been transported widely, providing extensive opportunities for 
establishment outside of its original range (Abel 1980; Clarke and Merlin 2013). Since the pres-
ent distribution of wild-growing plants in Asia is entirely or substantially the result of distribu-
tion by humans, it is not a reliable guide to the original indigenous area. Because the species has 
been spread and modified by humans for millennia, there does not seem to be a reliable means of 
accurately determining its original geographical range, or even whether a plant collected in nature 
 

27
Prehuman and Early History of Cannabis sativa
represents a primeval wild type or has been modified by domestication (Schultes 1970). The seeds 
of some wild-growing populations in India are remarkably small, unlike those collected from any 
other area of the Old World, but whether this is indicative of a distinctive ancient wild form is 
unclear. As discussed in Chapter 17, whatever ecological constraints once limited C. sativa to its 
ancestral home range, over the millennia, it has become adapted to grow in much of the world.
The hop genus Humulus is the closest relative to Cannabis, and indeed, the two genera were once 
considered to be the only ones in the Cannabaceae family. Given that they likely once had a common 
ancestor, the geographical distribution of Humulus might be informative of where Cannabis was once 
native. H. lupulus L. is native to virtually the entire northern hemisphere; H. japonicus Siebold & 
Zucc. (“H. scandens”) is indigenous to temperate Asia; and H. yunnanensis Hu is confined to Yunnan 
province in China (Small 1978a). The common area of the three species is China, and indeed, some 
have speculated that the country could be the original home of Cannabis (Boutain 2014).
There has been speculation that C. sativa occurred in North America in pre-Columbian times, but this 
is almost certainly the result of confusion with “Indian hemp,” Apocynum cannabinum L. (Figure 2.3), 
a native of North America, the source of a stem fiber employed by native North Americans for clothing, 
hunting nets, fishing lines, and twine.
THE HABITAT OF ANCIENT WILD CANNABIS SATIVA
The circumstances and adaptations of extant wild-growing populations of C. sativa provide a basis 
for judging its ecology before human influence. The species thrives in mammalian-manured, contin-
uously moist but well-drained soil, in open areas with limited competition from other plants (Figure 
2.4). This suggests that ancestral C. sativa grew on the alluvial soils near streams and other water 
bodies, and depended on herds of wild, large, mammalian grazers to deposit excrement (Figure 2.5).
THE “CAMP-FOLLOWER” MODEL OF EARLY 
DOMESTICATION OF CANNABIS SATIVA
Cannabis sativa is the most widely cited example of a crop that is postulated to have evolved ini-
tially as a “camp follower” (Anderson 1954; Schultes 1970). Humans at the hunter-gatherer stage are 
thought to have been nomadic, often traveling among temporary camps and creating trails among

these. Abandoned campsites and paths would tend to be open (unshaded), located frequently near 
lakes or streams, and the soils would be enriched by deposition of organic materials (excrement and 
unused remains of harvested animals and plants). Seeds and roots from gathered plants that humans 
would have selected for their usefulness would also be deposited in these open, fertilized areas. 
This amounts to selective planting of desirable plants in protected situations where they will receive 
excellent light and soil—a precursor of cultivation. Inevitably, people would have noticed and eagerly 
harvested materials from the plants that were growing along their routes and former homesteads,

Prehuman and Early History of Cannabis sativa
especially in garbage dumps, and such plants would have been among the first that would have been 
considered for deliberate planting. As described by Anderson (1954), this explanation is variously 
known as the “rubbish heap” or “dump heap” hypothesis (in archaeology, rubbish heaps are referred 
to as “kitchen middens”). It is interesting that, in parallel, some monkeys have been shown to cre-
ate “monkey gardens”—concentrations of preferred food plants in areas where they have discarded 
seeds (Rindos 1984). Uncultivated, colonizing plants that grow vigorously in human-cleared areas 
are known as weeds. It is no accident that many, probably the majority, of the world’s major domesti-
cated crops are related to, or are known to have originated from, such plants. The ability to be weedy 
clearly preadapts plants to being domesticated. Cannabis sativa is superbly adapted for the role of 
camp follower. It is very weedy by nature. It is also a nitrophile (nitrogen-loving species) and would 
have grown exceptionally well in the nitrogen-rich manured soils around early settlements. Its propa-
gules are thought to be distributed by streams, which, as noted previously, are often near campsites, 
as well as by people and animals, including domesticates. Because Cannabis has products (stem 
fiber, edible seeds, and intoxicating tissues) that could have been easily harvested and utilized by 
prehistoric peoples, it was almost certainly associated with humans in very early times (Figure 2.6).
HOW ADAPTATION TO STREAMSIDE SOILS LED 
TO WATER-BASED FIBER EXTRACTION
Alluvial soils near streams and rivers are typically sandy or silty and well-drained—exactly the kind 
of soil conditions in which C. sativa grows best. It would seem likely, therefore, that humans com-
monly encountered the plant near water. People would have noticed that the stems of plants that fell 
into the water disintegrated in several weeks because of rotting but left behind the valuable fibers (see 
“water retting” in Chapter 7). Subsequently, they likely deliberately steeped plants in the water to 
obtain the fiber. When agriculture was adopted, plants were likely grown near streams and rivers to 
take advantage of the suitable soils and conveniently close water that could be used to extract the fiber.
FIGURE 2.6 An interpretation of the early domestication of C. sativa in accord with the “camp-follower” 
and “dump-heap” hypotheses of crop origin. The plant would have been collected from the wild as a source 
of stem fiber, edible seeds, and inebriating resin. Seeds discarded on refuse dumps near temporary camps 
would have found ideal conditions (manured soil, an open sunny location, probably proximity to a water sup-
ply, and limited competition), and consequently would have become desirable companions for mankind. The 
pipe-smoking shown represents artistic license, as ancient methods of smoke inhalation in the Old World are 
controversial (Clarke and Merlin 2013). Drawn by B. Flahey.

EARLIEST GEOGRAPHICAL CENTERS OF THE FOUR 
KINDS OF DOMESTICATED CANNABIS SATIVA
For most of its historical association with humans, C. sativa was primarily valued as a source of 
stem fiber, considerably less so as an intoxicant, and only to a very limited extent as an oilseed crop. 
Fiber aspects of the species are examined in Chapter 7. “Hemp” (C. sativa grown for fiber) is one 
of the oldest textile fiber crops, with extant remains of hempen cloth trailing back six millennia. 
Cannabis sativa grown for fiber was introduced to western Asia and Egypt and, subsequently, to 
Europe somewhere between 1000 and 2000 BC. As illustrated by the two green distribution areas 
in Figure 2.7, there is evidence that hemp domestication occurred particularly in China in very early 
times (millennia ago) and later in Europe (where hemp became widespread after 500 AD). Detailed 
information on intoxicant races of C. sativa is provided in Chapters 11 to 13. Intoxicating races were 
domesticated in southern Asia. In most of the range, the so-called “sativa type” dominated, whereas 
in a much smaller area in southwestern Asia, the so-called “indica type” was selected. Detailed 
information concerning the evolution, classification, and nomenclature of the four domesticated 
groups is presented in Chapter 18.
EARLY OLD WORLD GEOGRAPHY OF FIBER 
AND MARIJUANA CLASSES OF CANNABIS SATIVA
As illustrated in Figure 2.8, dating back at least a millennium in the Old World, there developed a 
remarkable north–south separation of C. sativa selections grown mostly for fiber and those grown 
particularly for intoxicating drug preparations. In Europe and northern Asia, C. sativa was grown 
virtually exclusively for fiber, occasionally for its edible seeds (also useful for lubricating and illu-
mination oil). In southern Asia and Africa, the nonintoxicant uses of the stem fiber and oilseed 
were sometimes exploited, but the plants were particularly employed for drugs for recreational, 
cultural, and spiritual purposes. Clearly (as discussed in Chapter 18), strong selection for fiber in 
the north led to the evolution of races of C. sativa with characteristics maximizing fiber production. 
Conversely, strong selection in the south led to the evolution of races of C. sativa with characteris-
tics maximizing the production of inebriating drug content. A side effect of the north–south split is 
adaptation to the different length of daylight encountered in the two areas, as discussed in Chapter 5 
dealing with photoperiodism. Northern fiber-type races are particularly adapted to relatively early

flowering to survive in the shorter growing seasons of the north. At least the sativa type marijuana 
class of plant is adapted to flowering quite late, taking advantage of the longer growing seasons of 
the south (the indica type was selected for a relatively short growing season).
EARLY MIGRATIONS OF FIBER AND MARIJUANA KINDS 
OF DOMESTICATED CANNABIS SATIVA
Of the four kinds of domesticated C. sativa noted in Figure 2.7, the European fiber kind and the sativa 
type marijuana kind became predominant in being cultivated outside of Eurasia. Major transporta-
tion routes of the European fiber (hemp) kind of plant and of the sativa type marijuana kind of plant 
to the New World in post-Columbian times up to the mid-nineteenth century are shown in Figure 2.9.

During this period, the Americas served as important areas of cultivation of fiber hemp, while cultiva-
tion of marijuana races became widespread in much of coastal Africa. An excellent documentation of 
historical usage and cultural diffusion of Cannabis is provided by Clarke and Merlin (2013).
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• Words for cannabis (the plant or its preparations) are apparently absent from the Old 
Testament (but see Bennett 2010, who provides evidence to the contrary). As pointed out 
by Mechoulam et al. (1991), this is odd because the Assyrians who interacted considerably 
with the Old Testament Jews (Assyria thrived from about 2500 BC to 605 BC) extensively 
employed cannabis as an inebriant and medicament. Mechoulam et al. suggest that the 
writers of the Old Testament wished to suppress pagan influences and so censored all men-
tion of intoxicating cannabis (and opium, as well).
• Ancient China was the first site of extensive domestication and usage of Cannabis, and one 
of the earliest reflections of its value is the mythological Chinese “hemp maiden” or “hemp 
goddess,” Magu (Figure 2.10), described as a beautiful young woman with long birdlike 
fingers. Tracing to Taoist legends, she is also known as the Goddess of Longevity and the 
symbolic protector of females.

3 The Ecology of Wild 
Cannabis sativa
THE NATURE OF “WILDNESS”
When plants grow exclusively in nature, the term “wild” accurately describes them. However, many 
plants have been removed from their natural area and changed genetically to suit the needs or whims 
of humans, and sometimes, such genetically changed plants escape from cultivation and reestablish 
in nature. Sometimes, hybridization between genetically changed plants and their wild ancestors 
occurs, changing the latter. In either of these latter two circumstances, the term “wild” can be mis-
leading because humans have in fact removed some of the genes that contributed to the wildness of 
the plant. The word “wild” has been used in a broad sense to include all populations growing out-
side of cultivation and, in a narrow sense, to refer to populations of a species that are uninfluenced 
genetically by domestication. As discussed in Chapter 18, wild-growing plants of Cannabis sativa, 
insofar as has been determined, are either escapes from domesticated forms or the results of thou-
sands of years of widespread genetic exchange with domesticated plants, making it virtually impos-
sible to determine if unaltered primeval or ancestral populations still exist. Moreover, because the 
species has been spread and modified by humans for millennia, there does not seem to be a reliable 
means of accurately determining its original geographical range or even whether a plant collected 
in nature represents a primeval wild type or has been influenced by domestication.
Plants of C. sativa growing outside of cultivation exhibit various degrees of “wildness,” as noted 
in this chapter. Several terms are used to denote plants of different extents of “wildness,” and it 
is critical to be aware of the ambiguity of these terms in discussing C. sativa. Plants that develop 
as a result of seeds unintentionally scattered from cultivated plants are said to be “volunteers,” a 
label used in agriculture. Such plants are not really wild, although they may occur in uncultivated 
places. For the most part, volunteers appear in or very near the field where the maternal plants were 
grown. The word “spontaneous” is used in floristics (the study of plant geography or distribution) to 
denote plants that appear locally as a result of human activities, but do not spread. Such plants can 
be domesticates (e.g., tomatoes growing only on refuse heaps where tomato seeds were discarded; 
cereals growing only near mills where the seeds were processed) but may also be wild somewhere 
in the world but growing in foreign locations that are not particularly hospitable and so incapable of 
spreading. This localized appearance of foreign plants often occurred when their seeds were unin-
tentionally transported and discarded in disposable ship ballast, subsequently growing only where 
the ballast was discarded. The term “ruderal” (applied both to plants and their habitats) means 
growing in waste places or rubbish and is descriptive of the habitat of perhaps the majority of weeds. 
One also encounters “feral,” applied to wild C. sativa (and other weeds), although mostly, the word 
is used for escaped domesticated animals (such as dogs and horses) that are living outside of human 
control. Both the words feral and ruderal are ambiguous, since they are applied to (a) those escaped 
domesticates that basically retain all of their domesticated characteristics but nevertheless establish 
and spread vigorously outside of cultivation and (b) types of plants that differ dramatically from 
domesticates, with adaptations specifically suited to wild existence.
The term “naturalized” is employed to denote plants that have managed to colonize and grow 
successfully in areas where they were once absent. The term “weedy” applies to plants that simi-
larly grow successfully in areas where they were once absent but often do so particularly aggres-
sively and successfully (extremely aggressive weeds are often called “invasives”). As discussed in 
the next section, populations of C. sativa that can be described as naturalized and/or weedy have 

34
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
evolved adaptations (particularly seed characteristics) suiting them to wild existence. In this book, 
the terms “weedy” and “ruderal” should be understood to refer to “wild C. sativa” with specific 
adaptations for living in nature.
EVALUATING WILDNESS IN CANNABIS SATIVA POPULATIONS
As noted later in the section on seed ecology in this chapter, plants domesticated either for marijuana 
or industrial (nonintoxicating) usage have seeds that differ in several characteristics from plants that 
are adapted to growing in the wild. Syndromes of contrasting features of the seeds clearly differen-
tiate plants that have been domesticated (for fiber, oilseed, or drug use) from plants that have lived 
outside of cultivation for many generations. The seed characteristics found in domesticated plants 
adapt them to cultivation, and in contrast, the seed characteristics found in plants growing outside of 
cultivation adapt them to life outside of cultivation. Indeed, intermediate development of these seed 
characteristics indicates the extent to which a given population has been domesticated or, alterna-
tively, is re-adapting to living in the wild.
Named hemp cultivars and marijuana strains of C. sativa almost always exhibit the domesticated 
syndrome of seed characteristics, as indeed do almost all plants of the species that are cultivated. 
This domesticated syndrome is quite deleterious for free-living plants in nature, so plants growing 
outside of cultivation that have the domesticated syndrome of seed characteristics almost certainly 
have been planted (usually illegally) or have recently escaped from cultivation.
Cannabis sativa growing outside of cultivation is basically a weed, growing mostly in habitats 
created or modified by humans (Figure 3.1).
GEOGRAPHY OF WILD CANNABIS SATIVA
In Eurasia, weedy hemp is particularly widespread in southeast and central Asia and widespread 
in many European countries. To a lesser extent, C. sativa is found outside of cultivation in South 
America, Australia, and Africa (Davidyan 1972). According to Haney and Kutscheid (1975), 
C. sativa seldom becomes naturalized as a result of escapes from cultivated hemp in subtropical 
and tropical areas, perhaps indicative of the species being naturally adapted to a north-temperate 
climate. Wild plants in the Old World have adapted to various habitats for thousands (probably 
millions) of years, while those in North America have a history of only a few hundred years. Not 
surprisingly, in Eurasia, the species grows wild over an enormous range of climates and altitudes, 
much greater than in North America. Vavilov (1926b) observed vast stands of wild hemp in Eurasia. 
In the Himalayas, C. sativa occurs at altitudes of thousands of meters, whereas in North America, 
uncultivated plants are uncommon at sites over a few hundred meters.
In North America, C. sativa has been collected in natural areas from British Columbia to New 
Brunswick in Canada (Small 1972b, 1997; Small et al. 2003), and from the 48 conterminous states 
and Washington, DC (least collected in Mississippi and Idaho). However, many plants appar-
ently growing outside of cultivation are in fact illicitly grown plants or are recent (“spontaneous”) 
escapes from cultivation (in either case, the seeds reveal that they are domesticated races). In North 
America, weedy populations (possessing the characteristics of plants adapted to wild existence) are 
best established in the American Midwest and Northeast, and in southern Ontario and southern 
Quebec (especially along the St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes), all areas where hemp cultivation 
was concentrated historically. Many wild North American populations may have been derived from 
escapes during the resurgence in cultivation in both Canada and the United States during World 
War II. Naturalized hemp is uncommon in the western United States, rare in the United States south 
of 37°N latitude, and very rare in Mexico (Haney and Kutscheid 1975).
The rate of spread of wild hemp was studied by Haney and Bazzaz (1970), using herbarium 
collection data for the United States from 1870 to 1970. Over the century, they observed a steady 
increase in the number of counties of the United States in which wild hemp was collected, from less 
 

35
The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
than 50 in 1870 to more than 400 in 1970. Lush, extensive stands are developed in Iowa, Illinois, 
and Missouri, and more limited stands with smaller plants in most of the northeastern United States 
and Canada. In the western United States, where wild hemp is least successful, only small scattered 
colonies of hemp growing outside of cultivation are generally found, but these are often near cities, 
suggesting that they may be recent escapes.
Were it not for long-continued efforts by law-enforcement personnel to eradicate plants in North 
America, C. sativa would be more commonly encountered growing in natural areas. Given the 
resurgence of licensed cultivation of industrial hemp in Canada and the possibility that the United 
States will also permit such growth, escapes from cultivation will probably result in wild-growing 
plants becoming more common (perhaps even invigorated) in the future in North America.
HABITATS AND PLANT COMMUNITIES OCCUPIED
Vavilov (1926b) noted that in Eurasia, “Wild and weed hemp grow chiefly on the borders of the 
fields, in ravines, hollows, on rubbish heaps near settlements or habitations in general, near sown 
FIGURE 3.1 Ruderal (weedy) C. sativa in Turkey (above) and in eastern Canada (below).
 

36

plots on soils that are rich and not sod-bound.” As a weed in North America, C. sativa occurs in 
farmyards, waste places, vacant lots, in disturbed areas of pastures, occasionally in fallow fields, and 
along or beside roadsides, railways, ditches, creeks, fence rows, borders of cultivated fields, bridge 
embankments, lowland drainage tributaries, and open woods (Haney and Bazzaz 1970; Haney and 
Kutscheid 1975). The species seems very poorly adapted to penetrating into established stands of 
perennial vegetation and generally invades such areas only after the soil is freshly disturbed. As a 
colonizer, weedy hemp spreads slowly, except in drainage channels (the appellation “ditch weed” 
reflects its preadaptation to moist depressions). Weedy hemp in the United States is often found in 
alluvial sites disturbed by flooding (Haney and Bazzaz 1970). Haney and Kutscheid (1975) found 
that disturbance of the soil was extremely important in determining whether or not C. sativa would 
establish in Illinois, and moreover, the less fertile the site, the more hemp was dependent upon soil 
disturbance. Haney and Kutscheid (1975) also observed that wild hemp populations in Illinois do 
not persist at a given site, unless continuously disturbed, but may remain in a given area provided 
nearby disturbed sites are regularly generated. These authors noted that nearly all the populations 
they studied were on sites repeatedly disturbed by cultural activities, such as mowing, cultivation 
of soil, stream channel improvements, and refuse disposal. They also concluded that ruderal hemp 
is progressively more restricted to optimum and disturbed sites toward the ecological limits of its 
range. A survey of 1774 wild hemp stands in Kansas by Eaton et al. (1972) showed that 94% of 
the stands were associated with such past soil disturbances as construction, land clearing, tillage, 
livestock trampling, or flooding. Wild hemp was found in borders of cultivated fields (55%; primar-
ily fence rows), on nonagricultural land (24%; primarily right-of-ways and bridge embankments), 
native pastures (12%), abandoned fields (4%), cultivated pastures (3%), and in cultivated fields (2%). 
Wherever it is found, ruderal C. sativa usually associates with other weeds, as one would expect 
from the habitats and sites described here.
CLIMATE LIMITATIONS
Reflective of its extensive geographical distribution, ruderal C. sativa occurs in a wide range of 
climates. Most accounts of the meteorological limits of C. sativa refer to the domesticated plant, 
which has narrower tolerances than the wild-growing counterpart.
TemperaTure
Cannabis sativa does not tolerate cold temperatures well, but once again, the weedy forms are 
more stress-tolerant than domesticated plants. In northern areas, the seeds germinate at lower tem-
peratures and the seedlings and young plants survive frost better than do cultivars (Haney and 
Kutscheid 1975). Haney and Kutscheid (1975) observed that ruderal plants in Illinois germinated in 
early April, at lower temperatures than most other weedy annuals, and moreover that frost-damaged 
seedlings were never observed. Ruderal plants may grow more rapidly in cold temperatures than 
cultivars grown locally, but it should be remembered that wild populations have been selected for 
optimal growth under local environments for many generations while cultivars have often been 
selected in foreign environments. One may presume that wild plants that have become adjusted to 
near-tropical conditions near the equator have different physiological adaptations from wild plants 
adapted to temperate and subarctic areas.
WaTer
Both domesticated and wild plants of C. sativa are tolerant of hot, arid conditions provided that 
the roots are adequately supplied with water, but ruderal plants in Europe have been observed 
to be much more drought resistant than cultivars (Janischevsky 1924). In North America, Haney 
and Bazzaz (1970) noted that wild hemp in sandy soils in Illinois survives dry conditions in deep, 
 

37
The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
loose-textured soils by virtue of the roots growing to gain access to deep water sources. The gen-
eral absence of weedy hemp in western North America has been explained in part on the basis of 
the relative dryness of the West (Haney and Bazzaz 1970). While C. sativa prefers moist soils, it 
does not tolerate waterlogging. As noted in Chapter 7 regarding hemp cultivars and in Chapter 12 
regarding marijuana strains, some cultivated biotypes are susceptible to fungi in humid climates, 
but presumably, wild plants that have been present in an area for many generations have become 
adapted to the local humidity.
LighT inTensiTy
Both domesticated and wild plants of C. sativa develop best in full sun, and weedy plants thrive in 
open areas. However, some wild plants have been observed growing moderately well in shaded hab-
itats in Europe (Janischevsky 1924) and Canada (Small et al. 2003). Janischevsky (1924) concluded 
that wild plants were more shade-tolerant than cultivated plants. In general, however, C. sativa 
usually develops comparatively poorly in the shade.
phoToperiod
As detailed in Chapter 5, induction of flowering in most populations of C. sativa (except those 
adapted to the northernmost and tropical areas) is controlled by relative length of light from day to 
day, the plants normally flowering in the shortening days of late summer, although drought often 
speeds up maturation. Ruderal populations that have become adapted to their local region flower 
early enough to allow seeds to mature before a killing frost. Because of the briefer season, wild 
plants tend to be shorter at more northern latitudes and higher altitudes, although more suitable 
cultural conditions promote larger plants everywhere.
EDAPHIC (SOIL) LIMITATIONS
Cannabis sativa grows best on sandy loams. Because it is very intolerant of waterlogged soils, 
weedy hemp seldom survives on soils high in clay that retain water. Haney and Kutscheid (1975) 
found that weedy hemp in Illinois appeared to tolerate many soils (but not those with more than 
40% clay), provided that the roots receive adequate aeration. Well-drained bottom land is particu-
larly attractive to ruderal hemp, and it is often found near streams and creeks.
Nitrogen is the element that most plants in nature find to be so deficient in availability that 
growth is limited. As expected, therefore, most of the world’s plant species are adapted to substrates 
in which nitrogen is in short supply, and very few are nitrophiles (nitrogen-loving). Plants classi-
fied as nitrophiles are dependent on high levels of available nitrogen in the substrate and strip soils 
readily of nitrogen. Wild C. sativa is a nitrophile, growing lushly in nitrogen-rich habitats such as 
well-manured sites, but growing very poorly when the element is deficient (Figure 3.2). Indeed, 
one of the dependable indicators of the possible occurrence of weedy C. sativa is the presence of 
nearby manure or livestock. Vavilov (1926b) noted that wild hemp in Russia thrives in low places 
and ravines into which wild animal excrement is washed and on soils fertilized by grazing cattle. 
Manure not only supplies nutrients, but also the humus is important in retaining moisture that hemp 
demands (Dewey 1914). Weedy hemp is often found on the margins of crop fields, where the plants 
can take advantage of fertilizer run-off.
Weedy hemp in the United States has been collected on sandy soils very low in nitrogen, but the 
plants are dwarfed (Haney and Bazzaz 1970). Like many weeds, C. sativa is very flexible, able to 
survive as a dwarf in infertile ground but responding with dramatically increased growth to a good 
supply of soil nutrients (Janischevsky 1924).
It is well known that C. sativa requires ample calcium to grow well. This is consistent with the 
species’ natural adaptation to circumneutral soils that are not notably acidic. It also seems to reflect 
 

38
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
the large amounts of calcium that the plant accumulates as calcium carbonate at the base of the very 
numerous cystolithic hairs that cover the above-ground shoot, and as numerous calcium oxalate 
crystals within the leaves and stems (Bergfjord and Holst 2010).
SEED ECOLOGY
Cannabis sativa reproduces by small, slightly flattened one-seeded fruits (classified as achenes), 
usually referred to as “seeds.” Haney and Kutscheid (1975) stated, “Seed production data probably 
provide the greatest insight to the ecology of hemp.” Wild (ruderal or weedy) hemp, almost every-
where it occurs, was derived from plants that escaped from cultivation in the past, and re-evolved 
characteristics suited to wild existence. As detailed in the following, the seeds of wild C. sativa are 
remarkably suited to survival in nature by means of a number of adaptations. Wild populations that 
have been free from the selective influences of cultivation for many generations manifest extreme 
development of these adaptations, and conversely, populations only recently escaped from cultiva-
tion show only weak or no development of these features.
appearance
The seeds (achenes) of wild plants have morphological features that easily distinguish them from 
the seeds of plants that are cultivated, either for fiber, oilseed, or illicit drugs (Small 1975a; Figures 
3.3 through 3.5). These features, discussed in the following, are clearly adaptive.
Size
In nature, all plants arrive at a compromise between the number of seeds produced and their size. 
Like humans, some plants put considerable energy into generating a small number of progeny, 
which they very carefully nurture. Very large, one-seeded fruits like coconut, which provide a huge

FIGURE 3.2 Cannabis sativa plants subjected to deficiencies of (left to right) nitrogen, phosphorus, and

siderable flexibility with respect to soil infertility, allowing the species to produce at least some seeds under 
extreme conditions. Small et al. (1975) reported that the dwarfed plants were more or less comparable to the 
control in concentration of the intoxicating ingredient THC.

The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
amount of “milk” for the embro, exemplify this. More typically, plants produce a very large number 
of quite small seeds in the expectation that only a few will find suitable habitats and escape destruc-
tion. Dandelions exemplify the extreme of producing a huge number of tiny seeds. Cannabis sativa 
is intermediate in producing a medium number of moderately sized seeds, by plant standards. The 
species has adopted a strategy that allows small plants to produce at least some seeds, and larger 
plants to produce many seeds.
The seeds of wild plants of C. sativa are smaller than those of domesticated plants (Figure 3.3). 
Seed weight in C. sativa varies enormously, from more than 1000 seeds to the gram in some wild 
Asian plants to less than 15 seeds to the gram for some cultivated plants (Vavilov 1926b; Watson and 
Clarke 1997). Usually, the seeds of wild strains are smaller than 3.8 mm in length, in contrast to the 
larger seeds of domesticated selections. The ecology of the species may differ considerably accord-
ing to the size of the seeds, and this remains to be studied. The smallest seeds occur in ecotypes

native to alpine foothills of the Himalayas, possibly an adaptation to surviving at an ecological limit 
that is so stressful that it permits only a minimal amount of seed reserves to be accumulated before 
the plants expire. Large size of seeds in domesticated plants is usually the result of selection for a 
desired product in the seeds (frequently for food), but also, larger seeds provide a greater store of 
food reserves for successful germination and establishment. As discussed in Chapter 8 dealing with 
oilseed cannabis, larger seed size of domesticated seeds could be partly due to the practice of deep 
planting, requiring large vigorous seedlings to be able to grow out of the deep soil.
Seed Shedding
In nature, plants reproduce mainly by distributing propagules, mostly seeds and fruits (occa-
sionally vegetative tissues), commonly by wind, water, gravity, and cooperating wild animals. 
Humans have domesticated many wild plants, frequently specifically to harvest the seeds or 
fruits. Most wild plants cast off their seeds or fruits as soon as they mature, by various mecha-
nisms. This has two undesirable consequences from an agricultural perspective: when a seed or

The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
fruit drops away, it is more difficult to collect; and when seeds or fruits do not remain attached 
to the plant at maturity, it necessitates repeated collection of propagules from each plant over the 
weeks that they sequentially mature. Selecting mutations that inactivate the separation mecha-
nism (abscission, i.e., breaking away of fruits at their base so they fall away) or the dehiscence 
mode (i.e., opening of fruits to release seeds) with the result that the mature seeds or fruits 
remain on the plant greatly facilitates harvest. This reduction of “shattering” (natural shedding 
of seeds at maturity) is the most important way that humans have domesticated the majority of 
crops (Harlan 1995; Fuller and Allaby 2009). Cereals currently supply more than half of the 
calories consumed by humans (Small 2009), and in all of them, a “domesticated syndrome” of 
characteristics is recognizable whereby the “grains” (fruits technically termed caryopses) have 
lost the features in their wild ancestors that cause them to detach and scatter away (see, for 
example, Sakuma et al. 2011).
Although the precise anatomical and morphological features that facilitate release of cereal 
grains and the seeds of C. sativa differ, one can recognize a syndrome of seed characteristics that 
differentiate wild C. sativa from domesticated kinds of fiber hemp, oilseed hemp, and marijuana 
plants. The key feature enabling rapid release of seeds at maturity is the presence of an “abscission 
zone” (area of weak cells that weaken at maturity) at the base of the seed. At the base of the can-
nabis seed, one often views a circular scar (sometimes referred to as a “horseshoe” in European 
literature), the remnants of a plane of weakened tissue that served to disarticulate the seed from 
the stem to which it was attached. In conjunction with this feature, the base of the seed is often 
attenuated (elongated and narrowing), a characteristic that assists the seed to fall away easily from 
surrounding tissues of the infructescence (fruit-bearing portion of the plant). The combination of an 
attenuated base and a well-developed abscission zone in wild seeds (illustrated in Figures 3.3 and 
3.4) facilitates disarticulation as soon as the fruits are ripe, and this is essential given the consider-
able predation by birds on seeds that remain attached to the plant.
In addition to the features described here, humans have selected seed-bearing crops that mature 
most of their seeds more or less simultaneously, to minimize harvest loss. As well, a highly con-
gested fruit axis (adjacent seeds very close together along with bracts and young leaves) makes it 
very difficult for seeds to fall away from the plant and facilitates harvest of the seeds. A corn cob 
illustrates just how close together seeds can be packed and how most of them mature more or less 
simultaneously. These features are evident in plants selected for yield of seeds (as described in 
Chapter 8). By contrast, wild C. sativa plants mature seeds sequentially over a long season, and the 
seeds are relatively well separated so that they do not interfere with each other’s ability to fall off 
the plant.
Protective Thick Shell
In contrast to domesticated seeds, wild seeds have a comparatively thick fruit wall or “hull.” This 
(1) protects the seeds against mechanical abrasion; (2) makes it more difficult for herbivores to break 
open the seeds and consume the embryos; (3) makes it more difficult for water to penetrate, so that 
the seeds won’t germinate and will remain dormant, providing for germination over several years; 
and (4) keeps oxygen from entering and degrading the storage oil. Possibly, the thick shell also 
serves to protect the seeds from being digested while they are in the gut of some animals, so that 
they will be deposited and germinate in the animal’s excrement, an environment to which cannabis 
is adapted.
Camouflage
A camouflagic mottled layer covers the seeds of wild C. sativa, providing some protection for the 
fallen seeds against mammalian and insect herbivores. The layer is developmentally homologous 
with the perianth—the petals and sepals of many flowers. The dark appearance of wild seeds also 
contributes to their being inconspicuous. By contrast, as discussed in Chapter 8 dealing with oilseed 
cannabis, light-colored seeds have often been selected in cultivated plants.

germinaTion Behavior
Dormancy
Unlike the seeds of cultivated varieties of C. sativa, wild seeds of the species are generally at least 
somewhat dormant and germinate irregularly, features that obviously adapt the plants to the envi-
ronmental fluctuations typical of wild habitats. The dormancy requirement is typically satisfied by 
a period of cold treatment, aging, or some other natural condition furnished by nature. Haney and 
Kutscheid (1975) found that some fully mature Kansas wild hemp seeds could be germinated in 
the laboratory within three weeks of maturity in the fall, while seeds stored at room temperature 
reached maximum germinability in three months, but seeds stored at 5°C reached maximum 
germinability only after five months (immature seeds, if viable, required a considerable period 
before they could be germinated). Janischevsky’s (1924) study of Russian wild hemp seeds showed 
that fewer than 10% could be germinated immediately after maturation, but that repeated watering 
and drying cycles increased germination (water-soluble germination inhibitors may be present in 
wild hemp). Vavilov (1926b) and Scholz (1957) noted that the germination of Russian wild hemp 
proceeded very slowly and intermittently, the seeds often remaining dormant for weeks or even 
months, with typically only 10% germinating promptly.
Longevity
Dormancy is a natural adaptation delaying germination, but in C. sativa the delay is not much 
longer than a few years, since the seeds are not naturally long-lived. Haney and Kutscheid 
(1975) reported that seeds from ruderal Kansas populations declined in viability from 70% to 
4.4% in 15 months of soil burial, an observation suggesting that seeds do not persist in a viable 
state in the soil for more than two or three years. Indeed, recommendations to control weedy 
volunteer hemp often mention that the site should be viewed for possible reappearance of the 
plant for two or three years (e.g., Illinois Bureau of Investigation, undated; Eaton 1972). Small 
et al. (2003) observed that volunteer plants appeared for up to four years following experimen-
tal cultivation of wild plants in Ottawa, Canada. Goss (1924) tested germination of hemp seeds 
that had been buried in soil for 24 years and observed no germination in tests conducted over 
several years. Under artificial controlled conditions, the seeds of C. sativa can be stored for 
decades, as described in Chapters 7 and 17.
Environmental Factors Controlling Germination
Although seeds of C. sativa will germinate in the light or in darkness, B.J. Eaton (unpublished 
typescript circulated 1972) noted that light partially inhibited the germination of wild hemp of 
Kansas. This may represent a natural adaptation for seeds to await the darkness of being buried 
by soil before germination. Wild (feral) seeds germinate better after a period of storage at cold 
temperatures, while domesticated seeds germinate quickly on being watered (Small et al. 2003), 
reflecting adaptation to remaining dormant overwinter by wild seeds. Clearly, wild seeds benefit 
from a period of cold stratification to overcome germination inhibitors (Small and Brookes 2012). 
As noted in Chapter 7, wild seeds in northern areas germinate at lower temperatures in the spring 
than the seeds of domesticated plants, indicating adaptation to the cold spring temperatures of 
north temperature climates.
seedLing deveLopmenT
Seedlings normally appear in early spring and grow rapidly in suitable habitats. Once germina-
tion begins, a radicle (root of the embryo) emerges and grows into the soil (Figure 3.6a). The next 
significant event is the emergence from the fruit of the two cotyledons (primary leaflets). One 
of the two cotyledons of the seedlings is usually larger than the other (Figures 3.6b,c,d and 3.7),

a phenomenon termed “anisocotyledony.” This has been recorded for C. sativa in the literature 
(e.g., Walter 1938; Berkman 1939; Clarke 1981), although it is not well known. The first paired 
true leaves are simple (each with just one leaflet). The second and/or third paired true leaves 
are compound (each with more than one leaflet), with serrate (saw-edged) margins, and the leaf 
arrangement during early development is decussate (opposite, each succeeding pair rotated 180°), 
a combination of features that distinguishes C. sativa seedlings from those of most other weedy 
species.
Small and Antle (2007) discovered that in about 10% of seedlings, the clamshell-like fruit coat 
(pericarp) persists on the larger (“outer”) cotyledon (Figure 3.6c) but falls off by the time the seed-
ling becomes several days old. A dark, somewhat thickened area of the seed coat (the “cap”) also 
persists on the tips of the outer cotyledons in about 25% of seedlings (Figure 3.6d). Seedlings of 
most plants are very difficult to identify when they have just developed cotyledons, but the features 
noted in this paragraph can be very helpful in identifying them as C. sativa (Small and Antle 2007).
seed disTriBuTion agenTs
A variety of animals could serve to distribute the seeds of Cannabis in nature (Figure 3.8). 
Humans, other mammals, birds, and insects have been proposed as biotic disseminating vec-
tors for wild hemp, and water movement may also be important. Since the plant often grows 
in hilly and submontane habitats, gravity could also play a role. Because wild C. sativa is 
dioecious, the most effective dispersal agents should distribute at least a seed of each sex to a 
given site, although pollen is distributed so widely that even isolated plants may participate in 
reproduction.

The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
Birds
Since birds are strongly attracted to the seeds, Haney and Bazzaz (1970) suggested that they are 
likely the most important wild animals distributing them in North America. Janischevsky (1924), 
working on the ecology of ruderal Russian hemp, noted that birds are usually observed consuming 
seeds on cannabis plants but are much less frequently seen on the ground in pursuit of fallen seeds. 
Darwin (1859) observed that “Some seeds of… hemp… germinated after having been from twelve 
to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey.” Presumably the only hemp seeds 
that could germinate after passing through the digestive tract of birds were not macerated by the 
beak or gizzard. B.J. Eaton (unpublished typescript circulated 1972) fed wild hemp seeds to upland 
game birds, noting that quail passed approximately one viable seed/700 seeds consumed, and doves 
passed one viable seed/12,400 seeds consumed. It is also possible that some seeds are transmitted 
by adhesion to claws or bills (Merlin 1972).
Hemp seed is a superb bird feed (Chapter 8), and not surprisingly, wild bird feed has frequently 
been the cause of plants becoming established in a locality (Potter 2004). In recent years, most juris-
dictions in Western countries have insisted that hemp seeds be steam sterilized. However, some-
times, a small percentage (much less than 1%) of such sterilized hemp seeds in commercial bird 
feed can germinate (Small, unpublished), indicating that hemp seed in current bird feed may still be 
a continuing source of spontaneous plants.
Water
Weedy hemp in North America is often found in alluvial sites disturbed by flooding, and flood 
waters may serve to distribute the seeds by water transport (Haney and Bazzaz 1970). Hemp seed 
has been widely used as fish bait in fresh waters (Potter 2004; see Chapter 10), and this too could 
result in distribution and establishment. Fish are known to distribute some seeds (Anderson et al. 
2009), but whether this is the case for Cannabis has not been investigated.
Mammals
Ruderal hemp clearly depends heavily on human activities for dispersal. As noted in Chapter 2, 
large wild herds of mammalian grazers probably were important to providing manured habitats 
for Cannabis, and the species characteristically grows in moist areas, so the mammals may have 
distributed seeds caught up in mud on their hooves. In more recent times, domestic livestock may 
similarly serve as distribution vectors. Small rodents are attracted to the seeds of C. sativa and 
may play a role in their dispersal. The extent to which the seeds of Cannabis can survive a journey 
through the digestive system of mammals remains to be examined, but since some seeds will sur-
vive the digestive tract of birds, the same is likely true for mammals.
Insects
As illustrated in Figure 3.9d, insects, especially ants, commonly drag seeds of certain plants to 
their nests in order to consume a fleshy edible portion that these plants supply on the outer part 
of the seed. Plants often produce such an “elaiosome,” i.e., a fleshy edible appendage on seeds or 
fruits serving to attract dispersal vectors, constituting an adaptation for distribution of the seeds. 
Janischevsky (1924) alleged that he had discovered such a symbiotic relationship between wild 
hemp and the red bug Pyrrhocoris apterus L. He observed it apparently feeding on the attenuated 
base (the attachment area) of the achene, and concluded that the base was an elaiosome. Pyrrhocoris 
apterus is widely distributed in Europe and Asia, and Janischevsky speculated that the wide dis-
tribution of ruderal hemp was in part due to the insect. However, the insect is a generalized feeder 
that has no fidelity to Cannabis (Kristenová et al. 2011), and the bases of wild achenes of Cannabis 
and its relative Humulus do not develop genuine elaiosomes, although the detachment zone of the 
achenes is a weak area of the protective pericarp and might offer some limited nutrition to insects. 
Whether insects are significant dispersers of the seeds of Cannabis is unclear, but it is possible.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
ALLELOPATHY
Allelopathy refers to the chemical influence (generally inhibitory) of one species by another. Most 
often in plants, chemicals are released into the environment, where they affect the development and 
growth of neighboring plants. Allelopathic chemicals can originate from any part of the plant but 
frequently come from the roots and enter the soil surrounding the plant. Such “chemical warfare” 
tends to suppress competing nearby plants. Cannabis sativa has minor allelopathic properties (Inam 
et al. 1989; McPartland 1997b; McPartland et al. 2000; Pudełko et al. 2014), the compounds that it 
releases into the soil possibly assisting it to restrain at least to a small extent some competing plants. 
The cannabinoids and terpenes that C. sativa produces are located in the aerial parts, not the roots, 
but portions of the plant that fall to the ground because of age or wind could perhaps leach chemicals 
into the soil and tend to be protective. The fallen plants in the autumn may provide a mulch rich in 
allelopathic chemicals that protect seeds that remain in the location and germinate the next spring. 
The seeds themselves are sometimes “contaminated” with resin from their surrounding perigonal 
bracts, and the terpenes and cannabinoids in the resin could be protective against a variety of organ-
isms. Cannabis seeds have been shown to be antibiotic (Ferenczy 1956), but whether this is due to 
resin contaminating the seed surface or to internal compounds is not clear. For additional discussion 
of allelopathy in C. sativa, see the section “Adaptive Purpose of the Cannabinoids” in Chapter 11.
ROOT ECOLOGY
Root ecology is a key to the success of wild hemp, as revealed by Haney and Kutscheid’s (1975) 
study of wild Illinois hemp. Root development is conditioned by soil texture, compaction, and

ment) area is a genuine elaiosome (an edible tissue attracting insects, particularly ants, for seed dispersal), 
as shown in (d). In C. sativa and its close relative Humulus, including Japanese hop, the basal area probably 
does not function as a classical elaiosome. Photograph b (public domain) is by S. Hurst, U.S. Department of

The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
moisture content. In coarse textured, well-drained, deep soils, a main taproot develops, with slim 
lateral branches (Figure 3.10a). The taproot can extend more than 2 m down, allowing access to a 
low water table. In medium-textured, moderately water-retentive soils, the primary root develops 
to a depth of about 1 m, with extensive laterals concentrated in two locations: near the surface and 
at about 1 m (Figure 3.10c), a bet-hedging strategy enabling acquisition of both surface and mod-
erately deep water. If the water table is near the surface (generally undesirable for good growth of 
C. sativa), the root system is shallow (Figure 3.10b). Particularly in very moist soils, considerable 
lateral branches develop near the top, so much so that the root system may appear to be fibrous 
rather than tap-rooted. Similarly, when grown in pots, the ability to develop a long tap root is con-
strained, and the root system becomes highly branched.
Symbiotic relationships of the roots and fungi are often beneficial for plants. The vesicular-arbuscular 
mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae (Nic. & Gerd.) Gerd. & Trappe has been recorded on Cannabis 
(McPartland and Cubeta 1997). The ecology of symbiotic microorganisms associated with Cannabis has 
scarcely been examined. (See entries regarding symbiotic bacteria associated with the roots of Cannabis, 
in “Curiosities of Science, Technology, and Human Behavior” in this chapter and in Chapter 18.)

STEM ECOLOGY
Shoot and foliage architectural adaptations are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Domesticated fiber 
plants are drastically altered by comparison with wild plants, which are relatively wind resistant due 
to low stature and woodier, flexible stems. Domesticated oilseed plants and marijuana strains more 
closely resemble wild plants in the nature of their stems.
PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY: A KEY TO SUCCESS
Phenotypic plasticity is “the ability of individual genotypes to alter their growth and development in 
response to changes in environmental factors” (Barrett 1982). It is flexibility of response and allows 
a population to survive in a broad range of environments, especially marginal conditions. It is a key 
component of the genetic system of weeds (Bradshaw 1965; Baker 1974) and is often critical to the 
ability of species to diversify and adapt in response to natural and human-caused selection (West-
Eberhard 2003). By virtues of several of its ecological adaptations, Cannabis has exceptional adap-
tive phenotypic plasticity. These adaptations include: ability to grow large and produce many seeds 
in ideal environments or to survive as a dwarf and produce at least a few seeds in very inhospitable 
circumstances; roots develop as a widespreading fibrous system near the surface, where deep soils 
are too waterlogged, or grow very deep as a taproot to find water in dry soils (Figure 3.10); damaged 
main stalks regrow abundantly from lower branches (see Chapter 6); and tolerance of shade, despite 
being primarily a full-sun plant.
BIOTIC COMPETITORS
Most observations of pests and diseases of hemp are based on domesticated plants, and the applica-
bility of these observations to ruderal plants is unclear. Weedy C. sativa differs from its cultivated 
relative in several respects that bear on susceptibility to diseases and pests. Wild plants are much 
less homogeneous than most cultivars and usually exist in much smaller stands, rarely growing as 
densely as hemp monocultures. Wild plants of C. sativa probably have the advantage of natural 
biological control (i.e., a wide variety of predators and parasites that regulate the pests) and are 
toughened by limitations of nutrients, unlike the luxury consumption that results in relatively deli-
cate cultivated plants. All these factors suggest that while weedy hemp is susceptible to most of the 
same pests and diseases as are its pampered cultivated cousins, the degree of damage is probably 
much less.
human eradicaTion efforTs
In some areas, wild-growing Cannabis is listed in regulations calling for eradication of noxious 
weeds—objectionable not because of its intoxicating qualities but simply because weeds are con-
sidered undesirable. In most of the world, weedy Cannabis is of limited concern, although there 
have been long-continued efforts by law enforcement to eradicate ruderal plants in North America. 
In contrast to the huge social costs, the deleterious effects of Cannabis as a weed in North America 
are relatively minor. Discovery of extensive growth of ruderal hemp on a farm often invites unwel-
come attention, from the legal authorities as well as from delinquents who mistakenly believe that 
ruderal hemp in North America is as intoxicating as high-quality marijuana. As an agricultural 
weed, however, ruderal hemp is of limited importance (Small et al. 2003). Decades of eradication 
have exterminated many of the naturalized populations in North America. Mechanical eradication 
or tilling for two or three years is effective at destroying populations, and young plants are easily 
eliminated by herbicide applications. Liquid-propane flaming is also occasionally used to control 
C. sativa. All of these techniques are effective while the plants are still reasonably immature, but 
once seeds are produced, it is generally necessary to postpone additional controls until early in the 
 

49
The Ecology of Wild Cannabis sativa
next season. In Kansas, most wild hemp stands were found to be unsuitable for tilling (Eaton et al. 
1972), and disturbing the soil frequently assisted wild hemp to invade and establish. Planting a com-
petitive perennial grass such as fescue or smooth bromegrass has been recommended to eliminate 
the recurrence of plants in non-crop areas (Weber 1978).
pesTs and diseases
As detailed in Chapter 7, there are numerous animal, fungal, bacterial, and viral species that affect 
domesticated C. sativa, although generally the species is resistant to all biotic attacks. The extent 
to which the same problems affect wild plants has been inadequately documented, but it may be 
presumed that the wild plants are generally less affected than their cultivated counterparts because 
they are tougher by nature.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• Birds are well known to occasionally become drunk by feeding on fermented berries, and 
there may be a parallel situation with respect to hempseeds. As noted in Chapter 11, while 
the seeds (achenes) of C. sativa do not contain intoxicating constituents, resin from the sur-
rounding bracts can coat the seeds, and thus marijuana varieties could produce seeds with 
appreciable intoxicant ability. As pointed out in Chapter 8, cannabis seeds with adherent 
resin have been shown to be capable of making birds giddy. Because birds love the seeds 
passionately, it is possible that some birds have learned to appreciate the intoxicating quali-
ties of marijuana strains.
• Eliminating wild hemp, the present governmental policy throughout North America, is 
a very bad idea for many reasons. As discussed in Chapter 17: the plants are too low in 
THC to have abuse potential; although they are weeds their damage potential to agricul-
ture is insignificant; and they harbor valuable genes for breeding improved cultivars of 
industrial hemp and medical marijuana. Afzal et al. (2015) found another potential usage 
of wild hemp: as a source of friendly bacteria that can improve the root ecology of crops. 
The bacteria in question are not the well-known nitrogen-fixing “rhizobacteria” that form 
symbiotic relationships with plants but are “endophytic bacteria,” which enter plant roots, 
thrive within internal tissues, and provide growth benefits by producing plant hormones 
which increase nutrient availability. Afzal et al. (2015) concluded that “Wild C. sativa is a 
good source of agriculturally beneficial endophytic bacteria.”
• Wild cannabis grows so abundantly in Kyrgyzstan that the country has facetiously been 
termed “Marijuanastan.” There have been extensive efforts to eradicate the plants, which 
allegedly have relatively high levels of THC. Given that marijuana strains are commonly 
grown in the area, it is likely that wild plants there have higher levels of THC than in North 
America.

4 Sex Expression
WHAT IS “SEX” IN FLOWERING PLANTS?
Male animals produce sperm, females produce ova (eggs), and the combination of one sperm and 
one egg produces a new individual. Some animals are hermaphrodites, producing both sperm and 
eggs, but generally, identifying male and female animals is straightforward. Higher (flowering) 
plants are different, and introductory botany courses provide details on the varied patterns that one 
encounters. An essential difference between animals and flowering plants is that adult plants do 
not directly produce either sperm or pollen; rather, tiny multicellular female plants are produced in 
the ovary of the flowers (these are parasitic, relying for sustenance on nutrients absorbed from the 
flower), and even tinier multicellular male plants known as pollen grains are also produced inside 
the flowers (in the anthers). The tiny females are stationary, awaiting visits by the mobile tiny males. 
The reason that flowering plants have adopted this system is that they lack a penis to introduce 
sperm to the eggs, or they don’t grow in a habitat where water is available in which the sperm can 
swim to the eggs in the ovaries. Rather, flowering plants rely on pollinators or the wind to make the 
transfer, and when the tiny male plants arrive at the pistil (female part of the flower), they produce a 
“pollen tube” (analogous to a penis), which introduces the sperms to the eggs. Only pedantic bota-
nists concerned with technical details insist on referring to the tiny male and female plants (these 
are termed “gametophytes”) as the only plants that truly possess sex and insist on interpreting the 
large flower-producing plant as sexless (these are termed “sporophytes”).
Most flowers produce both sperm-producing and egg-producing gametophytes; i.e., the eggs and 
sperm emanate ultimately from the same flowers, so the plants bearing such flowers cannot reason-
ably be identified either as male or female (they are functionally hermaphrodites). But, as noted in 
the following discussion, in a minority of species (like Cannabis sativa; Figure 4.1), there are some 
plants just with flowers that produce only pollen and some plants just with flowers that produce only 
ovaries (and eggs), and it is common practice for the former to be identified as “males” (even though 
strictly they just produce tiny male plants, which produce sperm; such plants are technically termed 
“staminate”), and it is also common practice for the latter to be identified as “females” (even though, 
strictly, they just produce tiny female plants, which produce eggs; such plants are technically termed 
“pistillate”).
MALENESS AND FEMALENESS IN CANNABIS IN 
COMPARISON TO OTHER FLOWERING PLANTS
The sixth century AD Qi Min Yao Shu (“Essential Arts for the People”), which has been character-
ized as the first Chinese scientific treatise, stated (Mignoni 1997–1998): “If we pull out the male 
hemp before it scatters pollen, the female plant cannot make seed. Otherwise, the female plant’s 
seed production will be influenced by the male plant’s scattering pollen during this period of time. 
The fiber of the male plant is the best.” This passage appears to be the first recorded comprehen-
sion of sexual differentiation in C. sativa, preceding the recognition by about a thousand years, by 
Western botanists, that sex exists in at least some plants. Textbooks commonly identify European 
botanists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as the discoverers of sex in plants (Nature 
1933), but they appear to have rediscovered what was known long ago in China. Certainly, it was not 
until the eighteenth century that the true nature of sex in flowering plants became widely appreci-
ated (Anonymous 1933).

52
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The wild plants of C. sativa are among the small minority (4% according to Yampolsky and 
Yampolsky [1922], 6% according to Renner and Ricklefs [1995], 7% in publications cited by Divashuk 
et al. [2014], or some undetermined higher figure according to Bawa [1980]) of flowering plants with 
male reproductive organs (stamens) and female reproductive organs (carpels) confined to separate 
plants (i.e., the populations are “dioecious,” with unisexual flowers, those on a given plant either 
entirely male or entirely female). Familiar food plants with separate male and female plants include 
asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.), date (Phoenix dactylifera L.), hop (Humulus lupulus L.), kiwi 
(Actinida deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.F. Liang & A.R. Ferguson), papaya (Carica papaya L.), and 
spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). Staminate plants, with male flowers only, are routinely called males, 
and pistillate (carpellate) plants, with female flowers only, are called females, and this standard 
terminology is followed here.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE CANNABIS PLANTS
After seeds germinate, C. sativa normally grows vegetatively (i.e., without producing flowers) for 
several months. Following the summer solstice, shortening days (actually nights that become lon-
ger) induce flowering in most populations, as discussed in the next chapter. Floral buds (“primor-
dia”) are normally initiated in midsummer, growing from axils of leaves (the crotches between the 
leafstalks and the adjacent stem), at first along the top of the main stalk, later along branches. Once 
flowering commences, production of fully developed foliage (“fan leaves”) slows down, with newer 
leaves being relatively small and bearing fewer leaflets. Flowers develop proceeding from the base of 
flowering branches upward to the top of the inflorescence (the branching system bearing the flow-
ers). The flowers of Cannabis are small but very numerous.
Before flowers are developed, male and female plants of C. sativa cannot be reliably distinguished 
by appearance. Nevertheless, the sexes are different, not just with respect to reproductive organs: 
male plants at maturity tend to be 10%–15% taller, although less robust than the female plants, with 
slimmer stems, less branching, smaller leaves, and a more delicate appearance (Figure 6.1). Minor 
morphological differences (such as density of stomates and glandular trichomes) have also been

ance of the male.

alleged to be present between preflowering males and females (Truţă et al. 2007). Before sex in 
plants was widely understood, eighteenth century European botanists (males at the time, reflecting 
their perception of masculine superiority) often referred to the vigorous females as males and the 
wimpy males as females (Bouquet 1950; Stearn 1974).
Male plants die after shedding their pollen. Female plants protected from frost can remain alive 
for years (gradually losing vitality), although the species is normally an annual. However, cloned 
biotypes of female marijuana plants are often regenerated for many years by repeated cuttings, 
which do produce new vigorous plants, while the older plants show their age.
MALE PLANTS AND THEIR FLOWERS
Male plant morphology is specialized for pollen dispersal by wind; males are taller than females, 
with large, showy, highly branched inflorescences that provide large exposure of the exposed sta-
mens to the wind (Figure 4.2). The male inflorescences are loose, axillary, and relatively diffuse 
(technically they are cymose panicles or thyrses), as shown in Figure 4.3. Male flowers are pedicel-
late (i.e., with individual stalks), with five greenish or whitish tepals (distinct petals and sepals are 
not present) and five stamens with flaccid filaments (stalks) opposite the tepals. The male flowers 
fall away after anthesis (pollen shedding).
Male flowers at anthesis are extremely attractive to bees, including bumble bees and honey bees, 
which collect substantial amounts of pollen (which can therefore be present in commercial honey). 
Pollen-collecting flies are also often present. However, these insects do not visit the female flowers 
and so do not play a role in pollination.
FIGURE 4.2 A well-developed male plant. A plant of this size produces enough pollen to fertilize every 
plant in even the largest hemp plantations, and this phenomenal capacity means that very few, if any, males 
are needed in most cultivated fields.

POLLEN DISPERSAL
The sole purpose of the males is to produce pollen (Figure 4.4a and b), and they excel at this task: a 
single flower can produce about 350,000 pollen grains (Faegri et al. 1989), and there are hundreds 
of flowers on larger plants. Cannabis pollen rapidly loses viability after three days, but some grains 
can live for more than a week (Choudhary et al. 2014). Pollen from wind-pollinated plants tends 
to fall to the ground at distances approximating the inverse square law (i.e., proportionally to the 
inverse of the square of the distance from the source), although wind direction can considerably 
modify how far the pollen is transported (note Figure 4.4c and d). While the inverse square law dic-
tates that most wind-distributed pollen is deposited close to the source, some can be distributed for 
very long distances (Proctor et al. 1996), so it is likely that there is occasional genetic interchange 
among remote populations. It has been claimed that Cannabis pollen has been carried by wind for 
over 300 km (Clarke 1977). Cabezudo et al. (1997) noted that C. sativa pollen, apparently from 
marijuana cultivated in North Africa where it is common (Aboulaich et al. 2013), was transported 
by wind currents to southwestern Europe. Hemp pollen is a significant allergen for some people 
(Chapter 13), so its presence is often monitored. Stokes et al. (2000) recorded that in August, in the 
midwestern United States (where cultivation of hemp is not permitted, but weedy hemp is common), 
hemp pollen represented up to 36% of total airborne pollen counts! However, Lewis et al. (1991) 
found smaller amounts in Texas (mostly around 1% of Cannabis + Humulus, the two kinds of pollen 
taken together because they are very difficult to separate). Because the pollen of Cannabis spreads 
remarkably, an isolation distance of about 5 km is usually recommended for generating pure-bred 
seed, exceeding the distance for virtually every other crop (Small and Antle 2003). Because of 
widespread clandestine cultivation, the pollen can be found, at least in small concentrations, over 
much of the planet.
FEMALE PLANTS AND THE POLLINATION OF THEIR FLOWERS
Female flowers occur in axillary inflorescences (technically termed “spicate cymes”) that are 
smaller and relatively obscure compared to male flowers. They are also much more congested 
than the diffusely distributed male flowers. The tiny female flowers consist of a unilocular (one-
celled) ovary and a short apical style with two long filiform (thread-like) stigmatic branches 
(Figure 4.5b–d). Very small papillae (thread-like surface extensions; Figure 4.5a) on the stigmas 
are the landing platforms for pollen grains and represent the pollen-receptive part of the stigmatic 
branches. The stigmas are densely covered with receptive papillae to receive pollen (Figure 4.6). 
FIGURE 4.3 Flowering branch with male flowers shedding yellow pollen. Photo by Erik Fendersson, 
released into the public domain.
 

55
Sex Expression
The pollen-receptive part of the stigmatic branches may extend all the way to the ovary (Figure 
4.5c) or only part way (Figure 4.5d). Unlike the male flowers, the female flowers are essentially 
sessile (lacking stalks). A perigonal bract (sometimes called a floral bract) subtends each female 
flower (Figure 4.5b) and grows to envelop the fruit (this is important in intoxicating resin pro-
duction, and additional detail is given in Chapter 11). In contrast to the male flowers, the female 
perianth (sepals and/or petals) is not at all recognizable as conventional floral bloom material, 
consisting of a thin undivided layer adhering to the ovary (this unusual anatomical feature is very 
important ecologically as discussed in Chapter 3, and for classification purposes, as discussed in 
Chapter 18).
REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT OF UNPOLLINATED FEMALE FLOWERS
Because C. sativa produces enormous amounts of pollen, the stigmas of female flowers normally 
are pollinated, and this stops them from growing longer than about 3 mm. By contrast, illicit and 
medicinal marijuana are usually produced in the absence of pollen. The style-stigma parts of such 
virgin pistils expand notably in length (averaging over 8 mm), so that the female flowers have 
extremely prominent stigmas (Figure 4.7). Frequently, the stigmas also increase greatly in diameter

and occasionally develop more than the normal two branches (Figure 4.8). From an evolutionary 
viewpoint, this expansion of pollen-receptive tissue is an apparent adaptation for increasing the 
probability that pollen will be encountered, resulting in fertilizing the females when males are 
extremely scarce (Small and Naraine 2016a).
As discussed by Small and Naraine (2016a), the phenomenon of stigmas continuing to grow when 
they remain unfertilized is rare. Close to 90% of flowering plants have animal-pollinated flowers, 
and these (including their stigmas) necessarily have relatively fixed proportions, since their archi-
tecture must be compatible with the corresponding dimensions of their pollinators. By contrast, 
wind-pollinated species are not so constrained, and the flexibility of stigma size response to lack of 
fertilization, described here for C. sativa, has been documented for several other wind-pollinated 
plants, including spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and a walnut species (Juglans mandshurica Maxim.). 
The female flowers of maize (Zea mays L.) feature a pair of thread-like styles each terminated by a 
stigma (in maize, a style + stigma is termed a “silk”). The styles of unfertilized maize flowers con-
tinue to elongate for 10 or more days, and indeed, excessively elongated silks are widely employed

by corn growers as a sign that the crop has been inadequately fertilized. Whether the stigmas or the 
styles or both (as in C. sativa) enlarge, the effect is the same: making it more likely that the stigmas 
will encounter pollen and so the flowers will be fertilized.
The expanded amount of stigmas in marijuana “buds” has important consequences. First, the 
high-THC secretory gland heads of Cannabis, where most THC is located, tend to fall away from 
dried marijuana, significantly decreasing pharmacological potency, but many gland heads become 
stuck to the receptive papillae of the stigmas, reducing the loss (Figure 4.9). Second, although 
stigmas constitute a small proportion of marijuana—about 0.5% according to Small and Naraine 
(2016a)—their distinctive chemistry could have health effects. This has not been examined in 
Cannabis, but it is known that in some plants the stigmas can be toxic (Small and Naraine 2016a).
MONOECIOUS (“HERMAPHRODITIC”) KINDS OF CANNABIS SATIVA

cannabis plants are rarely encountered. Monoecious hemp plants were first deliberately developed 
in 1935 (Bócsa 1998). In monoecious forms, staminate flowers are normally located on the upper 
part of flower-bearing stems and are produced before the female flowers on the lower parts of stems; 
male flowers are also produced before transitional hermaphroditic flowers (some of which are 
sometimes sterile), which are also often encountered. The expression of sex in monoecious strains 
is quite variable, with numerous occurrences of intergradation between maleness and femaleness 
(Finta-Korpel’ová and Berenji 2007; Faux and Bertin 2014). In a monoecious population, individual 
plants may be entirely female, entirely male, predominantly of one sex (i.e., most flowers are of 
one sex), or more or less intermediate. Some flowers may be hermaphroditic (with both a pistil and 
stamens), and the inflorescence on a plant may develop both male and female flowers. Populations 
may exhibit various proportions of the different kinds of plant, including 100% male, 100% female, 
and a spectrum of plants with intermediate sexuality (a population structure that has been termed 
“subdioecy”). Sometimes, plants have the appearance (habit) of females but bear only male flowers 
(such plants have been called “feminized males”), and the opposite of this (plants with female flow-
ers but looking like males) have been called “masculinized females.” Environmental stresses during 
development can cause a reversal in the kinds of flowers that continue to develop. So-called “sexual 
chimeras” are plants that develop secondary branches with flowers of the opposite sex compared to 
the rest of the plant.
While male plants almost always die after shedding pollen, the presence of even a few female 
flowers on hermaphroditic plants seems to protect them against dying before seed set (personal 
observation). However, in a plantation setting, there is a much reduced need for the prodigious pol-
len production that is normal in the wild plants, so hermaphroditic plants tend to be bred that are 
predominantly female.
In dioecious hemp cultivars (with male flowers only on some individuals and female flowers only 
on others), rare monoecious individuals have been observed to occur spontaneously. It has been 
estimated that this happens with a frequency of 0.1% (Finta-Korpel’ová and Berenji 2007). Recently 
escaped plants are occasionally monoecious, but monoecy is associated with inbreeding depression 
and is therefore very rare in wild C. sativa, which is naturally strongly outcrossing (Heslop-Harrison 
and Heslop-Harrison 1969). Monoecy typically reduces plant vigor and productivity. Monoecy is 
also associated with smaller, less vigorous pollen grains. The pollen grains of C. sativa are usu-
ally spherical and three pored, with the pores most often arranged along the equator of the grain at 
equal intervals. Migalj (1969) found that the acetolyzed pollen grains of dioecious strains tended to 
have a diameter averaging about 33 μm, while the grains of monoecious strains were smaller, with 
a diameter averaging about 27 μm, and the pollen of dioecious plants was also more uniform, while 
the grains of monoecious plants were more variable in size and in number of pores. Zhatov (1983) 
reported that hemp pollen viability in dioecious strains may reach 90% under favorable weather 
conditions but usually ranges from 60% to 80% and that after three days of storage pollen viability 
was 50%, dropping to about 16% after seven days; pollen viability in monoecious strains tends to 
be lower than in dioecious strains.
Clearly, monoecious cultivars would not be as popular as they are if their advantages did not 
outweigh their disadvantages. The predominant advantage for fiber production is uniformity 
of plant height and habit, in contrast to dioecious cultivars, in which the males and females 
mature at different times (although as pointed out by Bócsa 1998, forms in which males and 
females mature simultaneously were first described in 1935). The widespread use of monoe-
cious cultivars promotes predictability of time of maturation and uniformity of fiber. In the 
case of oilseed production, all plants of monoecious cultivars are seed-producing, so space 
in the field is not occupied by unproductive male plants. For both fiber and oilseed cultivars, 
mechanized harvesting is facilitated by the uniformity of plants produced by monoecious cul-
tivars. Although monoecious cultivars tend to have an unstable sexual expression, monoecious 
cultivars facilitate the harvest of both stems for fiber and seeds for oil by reducing crop hetero-
geneity (Faux et al. 2013).

CROSS-FERTILIZATION AND SELF-FERTILIZATION
Self-fertilization is possible in C. sativa: pollen from the male plants of a population can fertilize 
the females of the same population, and in monoecious plants, it is even possible for a plant to fertil-
ize itself. However, inbreeding depression is pronounced. Van Lai (1985) observed that inbreeding 
resulted in plants with smaller and less fertile pollen, poorer fiber, and (especially) lower seed pro-
duction, all of these effects being more evident in monoecious than in dioecious experimental lines. 
In contrast to the deleterious effects of inbreeding, hybrid vigor is frequently observed. (As noted by 
Stepanov 1974, 1976, and others, whether or not hybrid vigor results from a particular cross depends 
on genetic factors in the parents.) To promote outcrossing, male plants of a given population tend to 
come into flower one to three weeks before female plants have receptive stigmas. Dioecious plants 
are thought to be mostly or entirely cross-pollinated, while monoecious plants are selfing to some 
degree: 20%–25% according to Finta-Korpel’ová and Berenji (2007; cf. Horkay 1986).
GENETIC DETERMINATION OF SEX
Inheritance of sexual expression in Cannabis has been studied extensively but is not completely 
understood (Hoffmann 1970; Truţă et al. 2007). Sexual differentiation in dioecious strains is based 
on a pair of sex chromosomes, the male being heterogametic, i.e., XY (Hirata 1924, 1927, 1929), the 
Y chromosome frequently described as larger (Yamada 1943; Sakamoto et al. 1998; unlike mam-
mals, but like some other plants), producing an approximately 50:50 sex ratio. Bócsa and Karus 
(1998) pointed out that females tend to be slightly more frequent in most hemp crops, with a ratio 
of 107–113 females to every 100 males. Menzel (1964) observed a heteromorphic (i.e., differently 
sized) pair of chromosomes in males of dioecious strains, but not in monoecious plants (consistent 
with the presence of an XX pair in the latter). Simmonds (1976) noted that “Genetic studies of 
monoecious lines have not clearly established whether such lines are all XX or are XX, XY, and 
YY, so the control of sex expression is not yet fully understood.” Faux et al. (2014) found that the 
five monoecious strains they examined all were of the XX type. Ainsworth (2000) concluded that 
sex expression appears to be somewhat determined autosomally, with an X/autosome dosage type 
chromosome system. Flachowsky et al. (2001) reviewed this topic and concluded that monoecism is 
determined by two autosomal genes.
SEX-ASSOCIATED DNA MARKERS
As noted previously, there are often differences in certain sex-determining chromosomes between 
males and females of C. sativa, but these are often unreliable for purposes of identifying whether 
a plant is male or female. However, the DNA of the chromosomes is composed of sequences of 
nucleotides, and differences in sequences (polymorphisms) among individuals are now commonly 
employed to analyze relationships and for identification of cultivars. DNA sequences in C. sativa 
can also be used to identify sex. Sequences characteristic of male plants have been identified 
(Mandolino and Ranalli 1998; Mandolino et al. 1999; Törjék et al. 2002), and the same is true for 
females (Hong et al. 2003). Immature plants, even seedlings, can be sexually distinguished by DNA 
sequence, as demonstrated by Techen et al. (2010). Other studies of male-associated and female-
associated DNA markers include Sakamoto et al. (1995, 2000, 2005), Flachowsky et al. (2001), 
Mandolino et al. (2002), Peil et al. (2003), Shao et al. (2003), Cristiana Moliterni et al. (2004), and 
Rode et al. (2005).
ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION OF SEX
Sex development in C. sativa is labile, modifiable by a wide range of environmental factors, includ-
ing nutrient excess or deficiency, temperature, mutilation, and light regime (Schaffner 1919, 1921; 
 

61
Sex Expression
Cheuvart 1954; Arnoux 1963). The proportion of female plants has been reported to be increased 
after exposure of seeds to ultraviolet light and by irradiation with gamma rays (Nigam et al. 1981) 
and decreased by shorter day-length during the growing season (Schaffner 1923, 1931) and higher 
nitrogen concentrations in the soil (Arnoux 1966a, 1966b). Such factors can result in sex reversal, 
and indeed, the aberrant production of plants with male, female, and intergradient flowers. In a 
survey of over 1400 U.S. herbarium specimens, 55% were male, but only 41% of the plants col-
lected along streets and highways were male; Haney and Bazzaz (1970) speculated that this could 
be due to the higher carbon monoxide levels near roadways. This is supported by the finding that 
carbon monoxide has been shown to favor the development of female flowers (Heslop-Harrison and 
Heslop-Harrison 1957).
MODIFICATION OF SEX BY HORMONAL TREATMENT
Sex development can be influenced by hormonal treatments (Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison 
1969). The application of auxins and ethylene feminize Cannabis (Heslop-Harrison 1956; Mohan 
Ram and Jaiswal 1970), whereas gibberellins are masculinizing (Atal 1959; Mohan Ram and Jaiswal 
1972; Galosh 1978; Chailakhan 1979). Cytokinins, which naturally occur in roots of C. sativa, may 
also promote feminization, as evidenced by the fact that cutting away some of the roots tends to 
masculinize the plants (Hall et al. 2012). Mohan Ram and Sett (1982b) and others have shown that 
male flowers can be induced on female plants by chemical treatments. In particular, Mohan Ram 
and Jaiswal (1970) and Mohan Ram and Sett (1982a) demonstrated that ethrel (also called etephon 
and other names) favors the development of female flowers on male plants. Ethrel, very widely 
used on crops, works by being metabolically converted to ethylene (C2H4), a gas that functions as a 
hormone, regulating many aspects of growth and development of plants. Chemicals that inhibit the 
biosynthesis or the activity of ethylene (including aminotoxyvinylglycine, silver thiosulphate, and 
silver nitrate) induce the formation of male flowers, and by contrast, the precursors or activators of 
the biosynthesis of ethylene (like etephon) induce the formation of female flowers (Mohan Ram and 
Sett 1982a,b).
Cristiana Moliterni et al. (2004) concluded that the ability of some dioecious Cannabis strains 
to undergo sexual reversion has a genetic basis. Some biotypes such as the cultivar Carmagnola are 
very resistant to treatments that induce sex reversions, while plants of the cultivar Fibranova are 
much more easily induced to develop flowers of the opposite sex.
REDUCTION AND ELIMINATION OF MALES FOR HUMAN PURPOSES
Culling of Most Male Plants When seeds are ProduCed for industrial heMP
Before monoecious cultivars were available, farmers realized that very few male plants were 
required for producing seed. Hemp grown for seed to reproduce the next year’s fiber crop in the 
early decades of the twentieth century in the United States required amazingly low numbers of male 
plants; most were removed except for one or two per 25 square meters as soon as they could be iden-
tified (Dempsey 1975). Eliminating most of the males could have altered the gene frequencies of 
the material being grown, for better or worse. Hemp growers in the nineteenth century complained 
that their material was becoming less productive after several years, requiring importation of new 
seed stocks, and it is conceivable that eliminating males in fields used to produce seeds could have 
contributed to the problem.
Culling of all Male Plants for the PurPose of ProduCing Marijuana
For production of marijuana, male plants are usually eliminated before they can shed pollen to 
fertilize the females, as unfertilized female inflorescences (“buds”) are highly valued (Figure 4.7; 
 

62
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
see Chapter 12). Female marijuana plants have as much as 20 times the concentration of THC as 
corresponding males (Clarke and Merlin 2013). By contrast, male fiber plants, although also less 
productive than corresponding females, produce a higher quality of fiber and before the twentieth 
century were often so highly valued that they were harvested separately by hand, when labor was 
cheap. Today, males are considered undesirable for fiber because they senesce earlier and degener-
ate, thus decreasing the overall quality of fiber when harvesting is carried out just once. In former, 
labor-intensive times, when the male and female plants were hand-harvested separately, selection 
pressures were probably more or less equal for the sexes, or perhaps there was some preference for 
male plants. Monoecious varieties are commonly utilized today for fiber, so that all plants mature 
simultaneously and their quality is uniform. For production of oilseed, dioecious varieties are still 
often employed, although at present there are very few varieties exclusively used for oilseed pro-
duction. Several “dual-purpose” varieties are grown for simultaneous production of fiber and oil-
seed, and these may be monoecious or dioecious. Because female plants are more valued for oilseed 
and drugs, selection has been much more directed to the females than the males.
seleCtion of feMale-PredoMinant MonoeCious strains
As noted above, monoecious strains can differ in proportion of female flowers on given plants, and 
proportion of mostly female plants in a population. Monoecious strains have chiefly been selected 
to generate fields of uniform plants for harvest of fiber prior to sexual reproduction, but of course 
seeds are needed to produce the next season’s crop. For this purpose, relatively few male flowers are 
needed (unlike wild plants, which disperse huge amounts of pollen for long distances to find scat-
tered plants, in a plantation a relatively small amount of pollen suffices). Energy that the plants use 
to produce male flowers is largely wasted from the farmer’s perspective. Accordingly, the propor-
tion of male flowers has tended to be decreased by selection.
generation of seeds ProduCing “all-feMale” Plants
McPhee (1925) observed that selfing a normally female (pistillate) plant (using pollen from occa-
sional spontaneous male flowers appearing on the female plant or from male flowers induced to 
develop by manipulating the environment) gave rise to seeds producing only female plants. In fact, 
the knowledge of this phenomenon is much older. Ascherson and Graebner (1908–1913) commented 
that older authors had observed isolated female plants bearing viable seeds that produced exclu-
sively female plants. The first registered “unisexual hemp,” the cultivar Uniko-B, which produces 
almost exclusively female plants, has been marketed since 1965. (Strictly, the F2 [produced by open 
pollination of the F1] is marketed as the cultivar, as the F1 seed requires considerable manual labor 
to produce.)
Using female plants, selfed with pollen that they are forced to produce by chemical or environ-
mental sex-reversal techniques, is now a common way to produce “feminized seed,” which is often 
marketed by the marijuana seed supply industry. Of course, this produces an extremely inbred plant, 
but once a female plant has been discovered with exceptionally attractive psychotropic properties, 
it is desirable to propagate its characters. As noted in the following, this is ideally done with 100% 
fidelity simply by cloning the plant; however, while the seeds produced from self-pollination will 
not reproduce the maternal plant exactly, the resulting plants will be closer in nature than had the 
seeds been generated by cross-pollination. As noted previously, only female plants are normally 
used for drug production, and the use of feminized seeds makes it unnecessary to remove male 
plants that are produced.
Industrial hemp seed in sufficient quantity to plant entire fields can’t be economically pro-
duced by the above technique, but an analogous hybridization trick is being employed. Special 
hybrid seeds are obtained by pollinating females of dioecious lines with pollen from monoecious 
 

63
Sex Expression
plants, and these are predominantly female (so-called “all-female,” these generally also produce 
some hermaphrodites and occasional males). All-female lines are productive for some purposes 
(e.g., they are very uniform, and with very few males to take up space they can produce con-
siderable grain), but the hybrid seed is expensive to produce. As pointed out by Bócsa (1998), 
field populations of monoecious hemp left to reproduce naturally will revert to dioecious hemp 
over time, and so monoecious hemp strains can only be maintained by constant regeneration by 
humans.
use of environMent and/or horMones by Marijuana groWers to inCrease feMales
As noted previously, environment and hormonal treatments can influence sex ratio or result in flow-
ers of a different sex developing on plants that started off as the opposite sex. Clandestine marijuana 
growers have used these techniques to increase the proportion of females produced by a given lot of 
seeds (hardly necessary with today’s knowledge of cloning female plants or using feminized seeds). 
In particular, marijuana growers have sprayed the growth regulator ethrel on young plants to femi-
nize (one might say emasculate) the plants as much as possible.
Cloning of feMale Plants
Humans propagate many crops vegetatively (e.g., apples, potatoes, and strawberries) as clones, a 
tactic to avoid the variability produced by sexual reproduction, in order to maintain a uniform geno-
type that is especially desirable. This is the method increasingly being used to propagate (female) 
strains of high-THC Cannabis, particularly the most desirable biotypes (Chandra et al. 2010b). 
Genetically identical plantlets can be generated rapidly using modern biotechnology (Lata et al. 
2009, 2010a,b). In perhaps an ultimate departure from normal plant sexual reproduction, propa-
gules of marijuana strains, generated by tissue culture, have been encapsulated to form “artificial” 
or “synthetic” seeds, sometimes called “synseeds” (Chandra et al. 2010a, 2013; Lata et al. 2011), a 
technique that is often employed in horticulture (Ravi and Anand 2012).
suMMary of the deMise of Male Cannabis under doMestiCation
Sexual selection is often recognized as a special kind of natural selection (Darwin 1859). It 
involves competition within a gender for the opposite sex and is important in evolution. In 
nature, males often are especially important in sexual selection. Human selection of the sexual 
characteristics of domesticated species is also a powerful evolutionary force, but by contrast, the 
males of domesticates have lost much of their importance. Farmers often favor females of live-
stock. Bulls are much harder to manage than cows, do not produce milk or calves, and humans 
only require a limited number to reproduce their captive herds, a situation reminiscent of the 
plight of the male cannabis plant. As detailed previously (and summarized in Figure 4.10), male 
Cannabis plants have also suffered significantly under domestication: (a) humans have created 
many cultivars that are monoecious (the plants bearing both male and female flowers), but a pre-
ponderance of female flowers has been favored; (b) cultivars have been created by hybridization 
that are entirely female; (c) seeds that produced female plants only have been created by selfing 
of female plants that have been tricked into producing a few pollen grains; (d) for marijuana pro-
duction, male plants are usually eliminated; (e) for seed production, male plants have sometimes 
been reduced; and (f) clones maintained for drug production are female. A curious aspect of 
the sexual evolution of Cannabis under domestication has to do with the fact that humans have 
turned a normally dioecious species into forms that are monoecious. This constitutes reversing 
the normal pattern thought to exist in nature—that dioecious species have evolved from monoe-
cious ones (Lewis 1942).

CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• Shen-Nung was a legendary mythical emperor of China reputed to have lived about the 
twenty-eighth century BC. He is said to have learned to talk by the age of three days and 
to walk after one week. At the age of three years, he made the first plow and invented agri-
culture. He is reputed to have personally tested hundreds of herbs for their poisonous quali-
ties, in order to find remedies, until one that was quite poisonous killed him. Despite this 
rather spectacular lapse of judgment for a genius, Shen-Nung is considered the Father of 
Medicine in China. Indeed, not long ago, it was common practice in China for drugstores 
to offer a discount on medicines on the first and fifteenth of each month in honor of this 
legendary patron of the healing arts. In China, yin symbolizes the weak, passive, negative 
feminine influence in nature, whereas yang represents the strong, active, positive, mascu-
line force, and in most drug plants one finds them in combination. But Cannabis poses 
a problem for medicinal use according to Chinese traditions, because there are separate 
female and male plants. Shen-Nung advised that only the female plants should be culti-
vated for medicine. Thus, drugs from female Cannabis were used to treat cases involving 
a loss of yin from the body, such as are said to occur in menstruation, gout, malaria, beri-
beri, rheumatism, constipation, and absentmindedness.
• The heights of the king and queen of France were used to predict the comparative height 
of male and female plants. It was thought that if the king was taller, the male plants would 
grow taller than the females, and vice versa. If male plants were taller, the fiber from the 
plants would be better. (In fact, male plants are virtually always taller than the females and 
do produce superior fiber in comparison to the females.)
• Male plants of C. sativa shed pollen grain prolifically. Honey bees love the pollen and col-
lect it avidly when available. Because C. sativa is a wind-pollinated plant, the flowers do 
not offer nectar to bees, which is the principal material that bees can use to make honey.

Sex Expression
However, honey typically contains pollen grains that bees have collected, and so wherever 
hemp is grown outdoors and honey bee colonies are nearby, the resulting honey is very 
likely to have at least some content of Cannabis. The male flowers do secrete some resin, 
which can coat the pollen grains, so that one might suspect the bees could become intoxi-
cated. However, as noted in Chapter 13, insects lack the cell receptors necessary for THC, 
the intoxicant chemical of marijuana, to be effective. In theory, humans who consume 
honey containing pollen grains from drug varieties of Cannabis could become intoxicated. 
In practice, this is a far-fetched scenario.
• As noted in the preceding text, male plants of C. sativa are relatively delicate in appear-
ance and die at a much younger age. Confirming the weakness of the male sex, Haney and 
Kutscheid (1975) observed that two-thirds of many Illinois wild hemp populations they 
studied were female, and since the sex ratio in theory is 50:50, there is obviously a much 
larger mortality of male plants.

5 Photoperiodism
INTRODUCTION TO REPRODUCTIVE PHOTOPERIODISM IN CANNABIS SATIVA
Photoperiodism is a physiological reaction of organisms to the relative duration of daily illumina-
tion. More precisely, “Photoperiodism is the ability of organisms to assess and use the day length as 
an anticipatory cue to time seasonal events in their life histories” (Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2007). 
In effect, the sun is acting as a master timer, controlling the initiation of biological developments 
(Figure 5.1). In the following discussion, the term “photoperiodism” is used with specific reference to 
induction of flowering. Although Garner and Allard (1920) are given considerable credit for clarify-
ing the influence of photoperiod on plant development, Tournois (1912) is thought to have first discov-
ered photoperiodism in plants (see Jarillo et al. 2008 for a review of the subject). Based on studies of 
hemp and its relative Japanese hop, Tournois observed that flowering was promoted by short duration 
of daylight over consecutive day/night intervals (giving rise to the expression “short-day plants”) and 
delayed by days with long periods of light. As with most other plants in which flowering is induced 
by a requirement for a given duration of darkness, a single exposure of a few minutes of light dur-
ing the dark period can disrupt flowering and delay maturation (moonlight and lightning have no 
effect). “Long-night” plants would have been a better label than “short-day” plants, since the length 
of darkness, not the length of light, is the stimulus. In the northern hemisphere, nights (i.e., length of 
dark periods) increase after the summer solstice (about June 21), providing the flowering stimulus. 
Although not yet clarified for Cannabis, it appears that many flowering plants use a photoreceptor 
protein such as phytochrome or cryptochrome in the foliage to sense seasonal changes in day length 
and chemically transmit a signal to the plant’s buds to flower.
Cannabis has been evaluated to be a quantitative (facultative) short-day plant—that is, flowering 
is normally induced by a required sequence of days each with a minimum uninterrupted period of 
darkness (“critical photoperiod”), but there is some flexibility in that at least some normally photo-
periodic plants will flower eventually regardless of photoperiod. However, as detailed in this chapter, 
the photoperiodic nature of different populations in Cannabis differs notably, and some populations 
are not photoperiodic. For those plants that do respond to photoperiod, the photoperiod of Cannabis 
sativa has been reported to range from nine hours (Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison 1969) 
to 14 hours (Borthwick and Scully 1954). The critical photoperiod required to induce flowers is 
10–12 hours of light for most hemp cultivars, often 13–14 hours for marijuana strains.
Cannabis may produce flower buds or at least undifferentiated primordial buds under continuous 
illumination (Borthwick and Scully 1954; Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison 1969); however, 
before these open, some cultivars require short days, while others will flower in continuous light, but 
only after a long period of growth (Schaffner 1926; Borthwick and Scully 1954; Heslop-Harrison 
and Heslop-Harrison 1969). The critical daylength may be longer for male plants than for female 
plants in a given population (e.g., 13 hours for males, 12.5 hours for females), which is consistent 
with the fact that males normally come into flower faster in response to shortening days (Borthwick 
and Scully 1954). Potter (2009) found evidence that “suggests that there is more than one critical 
daylength in Cannabis, one of which induces flowering and a shorter daylength at which vegetative 
growth is hormonally inhibited.”
Flowering is induced in Cannabis mainly by lengthening daily hours of darkness following 
the summer solstice, but also to some extent by intrinsic, genetic factors. However, environmental 
stresses also have some effect on flowering time. Weather, site conditions, and management prac-
tices can modify the timing of floral initiation (Lisson and Mendham 2000b; Lisson et al. 2000a, 

68
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
2000b,c). High temperatures accelerate flowering (e.g., van der Werf et al. 1994a), and drought is an 
especially important factor in speeding up maturation.
Marijuana breeders or generators of hybrid seed often need to coordinate the flowering times of 
male and female plants. Clones of both sexes can be maintained in a vegetative state under long days 
and brought into flower by short day treatment. However, males tend to be harder to control, and 
once they commence flowering, it is very difficult to have them revert to a vegetative state.
AUTOFLOWERING (DAY-NEUTRAL) PLANTS
As documented in this section, flowering may occur regardless of light regime in some popula-
tions. Plants at the extremes of the geographical range of C. sativa, either at their northernmost 
locations of survival or near the equator, appear to often come into flower because of intrinsic 
developmental reasons rather than photoperiodic regime (Figure 5.2). These plants that are indif-
ferent to photoperiod are technically termed day-neutral, more commonly “autoflowering” in the 
marijuana literature. At or near the equator, seasonal photoperiodic cycles are insignificant, and 
indeed, the seasons are often longer than required for full development. In the northernmost loca-
tions, the season is so short that the plants would not have time to mature seeds if they waited until 
days began to shorten. Clearly, therefore, there are adaptive (survival) reasons why day-neutral 
races would have evolved in the northernmost regions where C. sativa occurs. Near the tropics, 
however, the day/night difference is small and does not provide much of a stimulus to retain photo-
periodic capacity, and in any event, the plants have such a long season that they can grow almost 
indefinitely. Regardless of whether a population is day-neutral or photoperiodic, time of flowering 
is critical to the survival of populations of C. sativa, so that both wild and domesticated plants that 
have grown for many years in a region may be expected to have been selected for an appropriate 
flowering time.
Autoflowering strains can be very useful for growing marijuana indoors, since they can be grown 
under continuous light, which induces faster, greater growth (Potter 2014), and early- maturing 
strains may be especially suitable for production schedules. The autoflowering hemp cultivar 
FINOLA is ideal for growing in northern Scandinavia, where it can take advantage of the very long 
summer daylight.
Hybridization can play a sometimes unpredictable role in determining flowering time. Auto-
flowering marijuana strains that flower fairly early regardless of photoperiod have been described 
in the underground literature as having been generated by hybridization of short-season and long-
season plants. It does seem that hybridization can produce odd effects on photoperiodic response;

stimulating key developments in organisms. Prepared by B. Brookes.

LATITUDINAL PHOTOPERIODIC ADAPTATION
A worldwide, north–south pattern of clinal (geographically graduated and genetically fixed) photo-
periodic adaptation correlated with stature has evolved in Cannabis (Figure 5.3). “Bergmann’s Rule” 
states that within a taxonomic group of animals, individuals are larger in colder environments (an 
ecogeographic generalization with mixed validity). For plants, the reverse is often the case: the shorter, 
colder season at higher latitudes (or altitudes) limits growth and accordingly stature. Annual plants like 
Cannabis are designed by nature to maximize propagule production, achieved in part by growing as 
large as possible within the limitations of the length of their season and the cultural conditions of their 
growth sites. It seems clear that the historical migration of Cannabis throughout much of the world for 
purposes of cultivation was accompanied by strong selection for local photoperiodic regime. During 
domestication, some populations could have been selected for photoperiodic insensitivity (like some 
cultivars of strawberry and other crops), but this has not been important for Cannabis (at least until 
recently). Wild plants and cultivars are photoperiodically adapted to their local climate; plants adapted 
to growth in northern areas tend to come into flower readily with shortening days, allowing time for 
seeds to mature before a killing frost; and conversely, plants adapted to areas closer to the equator tend 
to come into flower slowly with shortening days, in order to grow for a longer period in the milder 
environment. (This has been recorded numerous times in the non-English, twentieth century European 
literature; for examples, see Ranalli 1998.) Russian (U.S.S.R.) agronomists classified hemp into four 
ecogeographical maturation groups, respectively adapted to a longer season: Northern, Middle-
Russian, Southern, and Far Eastern (Serebriakova and Sizov 1940; Davidyan 1972), so that races of 
Cannabis are available to meet the local photoperiodic requirements of most regions of the country.

in near-equatorial regions. Plants adapted to the intervening latitudes are induced to flower by shortening 
days, a relatively larger number of short days required for plants nearer the equator. The exact relationships 
between latitude and indifference or susceptibility to photoperiodism have not been determined, and because 
the climate and growing season at a given latitude vary according to longitude, a given latitude is unlikely to 
delimit the exact range of day-neutral plants. Prepared by B. Brookes.

Toward the equator, the season is longer than needed, and the plants tend to come into flower after they have reached a given stature. Toward the north of their range 
limit (about 66°N), the increasingly shorter season only allows progressively smaller plants to develop. Compare Figure 5.2. Prepared by B. Brookes.
 

71
Photoperiodism
Time of flowering is a critical determinant of yield in C. sativa. In most biotypes, induction of 
flowering substantially stops vegetative plant growth, so stem fiber and biomass are affected. As dis-
cussed in the chapters dealing with particular products for which the plant is grown (fiber, oilseed, 
marijuana, biomass, essential oil, or any other purpose), quality is often also affected. Problems 
that can arise from growing a strain in an inappropriate photoperiodic regime are examined in the 
following.
As noted previously, most hemp cultivars (mostly originating from temperate areas of the world) 
have critical photoperiods ranging from 10 to 12 hours. Most plants used for pharmacological or 
recreational marijuana originate from south-temperate and subtropical areas and so are adapted 
to being induced to flower by critical photoperiods that are closer to 12 hours than to 9 hours. 
Growers of indoor marijuana wish to provide as much light as possible to maximize growth but 
need to shorten the lighted period to induce flowering. Not surprisingly, in view of the fact that 
12 hours is usually minimal to ensure flowering of marijuana strains, reducing light availability to 
a 12-hour period daily is almost universally recommended to induce flowering of plants grown for 
marijuana. Potter (2014) reported that about 90% of 200 marijuana strains examined flowered seven 
to nine weeks after the initiation of short-day treatment.
THE INTERACTION OF PHOTOPERIODISM, 
KILLING FROSTS, AND SEED PRODUCTION
The purpose of chickens is to make eggs, and similarly, the purpose of plants is to make seeds—as 
many as possible given a particular species’ natural reproductive abilities and the permissiveness 
of its environment. In most of its range, Cannabis is capable of continuing to mature seeds until 
degraded and killed by frost. Like numerous other plants with many flowers, frequently, many flow-
ers are fertilized, and seeds mature sequentially over weeks or even months, if seasonal conditions 
permit. If a region experiences an early frost, fewer viable seeds are produced, but if an unusually 
long season (“Indian summer”) occurs, more seeds are produced. Accordingly, while the particular 
inherited timing of flowering is a natural limitation of how many seeds can be produced, there is 
some variation from year to year depending on climate variation.
The information presented in the previous paragraph needs to be distinguished from another 
concept—determinate vs. indeterminate growth. Tomato plants exemplify this point (they are 
perennials but are grown as annuals). Determinate tomato plants (usually small herbaceous shrubs) 
stop growing in late season, and there is a limited number of fruits (not necessarily a small num-
ber) that can be harvested. Indeterminate tomato plants (usually vines) keep on growing, keep on 
producing flowers that are fertilized, and keep on maturing new fruits. Cannabis normally exhibits 
determinate growth: once flowering is induced, vegetative growth (production of new branches 
and leaves) substantially slows and ceases while flowers develop, get pollinated, and transform into 
seeds. In Cannabis, as in most short-day plants, short days cause the plant to stop producing buds 
that produce leaves and branches and to start producing buds that produce flowers. Both vegetative 
growth and reproductive growth are more or less determinate (the species is, after all, an annual), 
but sometimes, under greenhouse conditions (which are hardly natural), female plants may continue 
growth.
PHOTOPERIODIC PROBLEMS FOR PLANTS OF NORTHERN 
ORIGIN GROWN CLOSE TO THE EQUATOR
There have been extensive studies of flowering time of European fiber hemp cultivars (e.g., 
Amaducci et al. 2008a,b,c). (By comparison, relatively limited research has been conducted on 
flowering photoperiodism of C. sativa adapted to semitropical and tropical regions.) For the north-
ern hemisphere, higher latitude of origin is associated with earlier flowering and seed maturation 
(e.g., De Meijer and Keizer 1996a). Growing hemp cultivars adapted to the relatively short season 
 

72
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
of more northern latitudes, in longer-season regions (closer to the equator), results in earlier than 
desirable flowering (Figure 5.4, bottom), a phenomenon that has sometimes been described as “pre-
flowering” (Amaducci et al. 2008a).
European fiber varieties (representing most of the world’s certified cultivars of C. sativa) were 
developed for regions north of the 45th parallel (Watson and Clarke 1997). These are mostly 
adapted to long summer daylengths, flowering in the autumn in response to shortening days. In 
equatorial regions, daylength is always short enough for these northern varieties to initiate flow-
ering, and northern cultivars flower prematurely when 1–2 m high, limiting yield. This occurs, 
for example, in Australia (Ditchfield et al. 1997; Hall et al. 2014). Indeed, moving northern 
European cultivars as little as 10°–15° closer to the equator reduces performance substantially 
(Dippenaar et al. 1996).
PHOTOPERIODIC PROBLEMS FOR PLANTS OF SEMITROPICAL 
ORIGIN GROWN IN NORTHERN LATITUDES
The previous discussion points out the deleterious effect of moving plants, adapted to a northern 
photoperiod regime, closer to the equator. Conversely, when plants adapted to the photoperiod of 
semitropical climates are grown in north-temperate climates, they may mature so late that they 
succumb to cold weather before they can produce seeds (Heslop-Harrison and Heslop-Harrison

FIGURE 5.4 Examples of adaptation to local photoperiod that result in inadaptive induction of flowering 
when grown in an unsuitable latitude. Top: A race of C. sativa photoperiodically adapted to a long southern 
season but coming into flower very late when grown in a short northern season. These plants from southern 
Europe have remained vegetative when grown in Ottawa, Canada (latitude 45.4°N), shortly before a killing 
autumn frost. Bottom: A race of C. sativa photoperiodically adapted to a short northern season but coming

United States, where the growth season extends for several more months, and male plants adapted to the cli-
mate would continue to grow and reach several meters in height.
 

73
Photoperiodism
1969; Figure 5.4, top). For fiber production in relatively high-latitude and high-altitude locations, it 
is sometimes desirable to grow cultivars that mature very late (even too late to produce seeds before 
winter) in order to continue stalk production for as long as possible. (Depending on variety, however, 
growing for an excessively long period may lower fiber quality.) Of course, seeds for such cultivars 
would have to be produced in areas with longer growing seasons, in locations closer to the equator.
Photoperiodic differences are particularly apparent when Cannabis populations obtained from 
different latitudes are grown together in experimental plantations. In Ottawa, Canada, where I have 
grown over 1000 accessions outdoors, those from the northernmost locations (Siberia) sometimes 
produced seeds in less than a month after planting, while some from near-equatorial locations (India, 
Africa) sometimes remained vegetative after five months (and were killed by frost). When hemp 
cultivation was authorized in Canada in 1998 (after more than a half century of prohibition), the 
only source of cultivars with reliably low tetrahydrocannabinol (a requirement) was the European 
Union; embarrassingly, most of the cultivars were so late-maturing that they were unsuitable for 
Canadian locations. (It is possible to harvest vegetative plants of hemp for fiber, but Canadian plants 
are chiefly grown for oilseed.)
PHOTOPERIODIC PROBLEMS FOR SEMIEQUATORIAL 
DRUG STRAINS IN NORTHERN CLIMATES
Most drug forms have historically been cultivated in areas south of the north-temperate zone, some-
times close to the equator, where they may be photoperiodically adapted to near-12-hour days and 
an associated long season. In Chapters 12 and 13, two groups of marijuana plants are discussed; 
many strains of the less common “indica type” are able to mature in relatively northern locations. 
Although indica type strains originate from relatively southern areas of the Northern Hemisphere, 
they seem to mature earlier than sativa type strains because of adaptation to a shorter season due 
to drought. By contrast, non-marijuana plants (both wild and legally cultivated) are mostly found 
in north-temperate climates and are photoperiodically adapted to mature by the fall season in such 
locations. When drug strains are grown in north-temperate climates, maturation is much delayed 
until late autumn, or the plants succumb to cold weather before they are able to produce seeds. Before 
illicit marijuana growers became acquainted with the fact that most marijuana strains are very late-
maturing, they often found that their clandestine outdoor plants remained vegetative, not producing 
the congested flowering tops (buds) that are most valued. Particularly in California, hybridization 
and selection produced marijuana strains that are capable of flowering outdoors (Clarke and Merlin 
2013). Of course, photoperiod can easily be controlled indoors by varying light (or dark) period, 
which is one of the reasons why marijuana is commonly grown in buildings.
UNSUITABLE PHOTOPERIOD MAY NOT BE THE 
ONLY CAUSE OF POOR PERFORMANCE
In addition to photoperiodic adaptation, climate adaptation determines the success of Cannabis 
crops selected in one part of the world but grown in a quite foreign location. The point is that lack of 
adaptation to the stresses in a new location, caused by local climate and/or local biotic agents, can 
worsen the deleterious effects of unsuitable photoperiod. Most hemp cultivars (mostly fiber strains) 
were developed for relatively cool northern regions and do not perform well when moved closer to 
the hotter equator (Watson and Clarke 1997). This has occurred, for example, when European cul-
tivars were planted in South Africa: flower initiation was induced in the five varieties grown only 
34 days after sowing, extreme heat hastening maturation (Dippenaar et al. 1996). In addition, when 
cultivars are grown in foreign locations, adaptation to pests and diseases can be a problem. Northern 
fiber cultivars, when grown near the equator, have proven to be very susceptible to a wide range of 
biotic agents for which they have no resistance (Watson and Clarke 1997).

CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• The floral industry relies on photoperiodism to bring some ornamental plants into flower to 
meet seasonal demand, especially for major holidays. The most important of these is poin-
settia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ex Klotzsch; Figure 5.5). For proper floral develop-
ment, the plants need to be kept in complete darkness (uninterrupted by occasional light) 
for a period of 12 to 14 hours daily for 8–10 weeks. Commercial greenhouse growers 
generally accomplish this by the use of shade curtains.
• Plants are not the only species to employ daylength to initiate important processes in their 
life cycles—so do many animals, especially mammals (Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2007). 
A familiar example to dog owners is the seasonal shedding of fur. Another example is 
the singing of male canaries, which is much more frequent in the spring because the pho-
toperiod causes their testes to grow, and they want to attract females. Humans exhibit a 
wide variety of seasonal behaviors, but it is uncertain whether any of these are related to 
photoperiodic regime (Weir 2001; Bronson 2004).
• Certain plant species have flowers that open and close at approximately fixed times dur-
ing the day, regardless of weather or season. For example, some species of morning glory 
do indeed open their flowers in the morning, while four-O-clock opens its flowers in late 
afternoon. The eighteenth century Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (the Father of Binomial 
Nomenclature, for which additional information is given in Chapter 18) designed (but may 
not have ever actually planted) a 12-hour daylight floral clock, composed of flowering spe-
cies arranged in a circle, the times of opening or closing of their flowers roughly indicating 
the time of day. Botanists have replicated Linnaeus’ clock in different places, only to often 
find that the clock did not work because the plants that flowered at the anticipated times 
in Sweden would not do so at different latitudes because of their photoperiodic require-
ments. Moreover, the circadian (daily) rhythms of the flowers are rather variable because 
of climate. For those wishing to test out Linnaeus’ clock at their home location, see 
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/garden / planting-a-clock-that-tracks-hours-by-flowers 
.html?_r=0.
• Perennial ornamental plants can be arranged in a garden, sequentially according to their 
flowering times, to form a “bloom calendar.” However, because flowering time of many 
species is determined by photoperiodism, and often influenced by environment, the suit-
ability of given species will differ according to latitude and climate.

6 Shoot and Foliage Architecture
This chapter is concerned with how human selection of Cannabis sativa for different purposes (fiber 
from the stem, drugs from the inflorescence, and oil from the edible seeds) has altered the external 
appearance of the “shoot” (above-ground part of the plant) by comparison with that of wild-growing 
plants. Stem features that are of particular adaptive importance to C. sativa include its main stem 
(“stalk”) and patterns of branching with respect to the disposition of the foliage and reproductive 
organs. Leaf features that are of importance include size and width of the leaflets. Because male 
plants are less robust than females, die after flowering, and have not been nearly as subject to strong 
selection by humans as the females, features discussed in this chapter pertain particularly to female 
plants.
ANATOMY AND MORPHOLOGY
This chapter has considerable information on the anatomy (internal structure) and morphology 
(external structure) of C. sativa. Additional anatomical and developmental features are described 
in several of the chapters in this book where they are particularly relevant. Chapter 3, dealing with 
ecology, contrasts adaptive features of wild and domesticated plants. Chapter 4 describes male 
and female plants in detail. Chapter 7, on fiber content, deals with stem features, which are criti-
cal to fiber characteristics. Chapter 8, on oilseed, deals with structure of the seeds. Chapter 11, on 
chemical aspects, describes the drug-secreting glands of the plant. Mediavilla et al. (1998) present 
a detailed analysis of the morphological life cycle of the plant. Chapter 8 in Hayward (1938) pro-
vides a detailed analysis of the developmental anatomy of C. sativa. The composite plate shown in 
Figure 6.1, perhaps the best scientific drawing of the hemp plant ever prepared, illustrates the most 
important parts of the cannabis plant.
BASIC LEAF BOTANY OF CANNABIS
The leaf of Cannabis is probably more widely recognized than the foliage of any other plant. The 
smallest leaves are located at the branch apices and are “unifoliolate” (bearing one leaflet; “unifo-
liate” is incorrect, since it means “one-leaved”). The larger leaves are multifoliolate (with several 
leaflets). The multifoliolate leaves tend to be decussate on the lower stem (with opposite pairs, the 
succeeding pairs turned 180°), usually alternate near the stem apex, petiolate (with a leaf stalk), 
palmately compound (the bases originating from a common point) with an odd number (3–13) of 
coarsely serrate, lanceolate leaflets, with the proximal pair (i.e., closest to the stem) notably small. 
The foliage and stems of some populations are sometimes anthocyanin-streaked, and frost often 
causes plants to similarly become suffused with purple; as discussed in Chapter 12, this represents 
one of the kinds of coloration that has been preferentially selected in some marijuana strains.
SHOOT ARCHITECTURE OF WILD PLANTS
Figure 6.2 shows the appearance of well-developed wild plants, which characteristically produce 
a main stem from which many branches arise. As with numerous annual herbaceous plants, ulti-
mate size depends on the availability of nutrients, water, and light; and crowding from competition 
tends to suppress lower branching and promote vertical growth. In a given wild population, one 
may find plants that are less than 30 cm in height, and some exceeding 2 m. The widespread asser-
tion on the Internet that there is a unique wild species, “Cannabis ruderalis,” that is quite short, 

76

is rubbish—very short plants growing outside of cultivation have simply developed in a stressful 
environment or are adapted to short seasons and so do not have time to become large. Janischevsky 
(1924), the author of the name C. ruderalis, noted that when his alleged species grew in well-
manured sites, the plants grew very large.
SHOOT ARCHITECTURE OF PLANTS GROWN 
IN DIFFERENT FIELD CONFIGURATIONS
The height and branching pattern of C. sativa have been altered in domesticated plants in ways that 
maximize production of the desired product (stem fiber, drugs from the inflorescence, or seeds). 
These differences have become genetically fixed by selection but are accentuated by density of 
planting because, just as with trees in forests, crowding suppresses branching and promotes vertical 
growth. The various agricultural field configuration patterns that are commonly encountered are 
shown in Figure 6.3 and are discussed in the following paragraphs.

Shoot and Foliage Architecture
Figure 6.3a and b shows shoot configurations typical of marijuana strains of C. sativa. As dis-
cussed in Chapters 12, 13, and 18, there are two basic classes of marijuana plants, “indica type” 
(shorter ones; Figure 6.3a) and “sativa type” (taller ones; Figure 6.3b). All of these plants are naturally 
(genetically) very well branched (like wild plants). Moreover, they are traditionally planted (outdoors 
at least) at low density, leaving room for the branches to develop well. Maximizing branch production 
is desirable to produce many flowers, as the perigonal bracts (discussed in Chapter 11) around the 
female flowers produce most of the intoxicating chemicals that are desired. As discussed in Chapter 4, 
male plants are removed to prevent production of seeds, which are not the desired product.
As discussed in Chapter 9, a very recent market has developed for the production of essential (volatile) 
oil, a product substantially from the perigonal bracts, exactly the same source of chemicals for marijuana. 
Plants of the same architecture as sativa type marijuana (Figure 6.3b) have been used as sources of essen-
tial oil (indeed, such strains are very suitable for the purpose, although they pose security problems).
As discussed in Chapter 8, there has been comparatively limited selection of strains of C. sativa 
in historical times specifically for oilseed production. Since plants that are big and well branched 
produce many flowers (such as those shown in Figure 6.3b), when allowed to produce seeds, they 
do so very well. Such plants have been commonly used as sources of oilseeds. In more recent times, 
as discussed in Chapter 8, short plants with numerous flowers (and hence seeds) congested on short 
branches (as shown in Figure 6.3e) have been grown at moderate densities to produce oilseeds, a 
strategy that reduces the production of stem tissue in a given area while maximizing the production 
of seeds on a given acreage. Plants with limited (or at least short) branching are naturally superior 
than irregularly branching plants for the purpose of fully and uniformly occupying a field and maxi-
mally utilizing solar irradiation.
As noted previously, different densities of planting are used to increase or suppress branching, but the 
different kinds of C. sativa have been genetically selected—some to grow well at high concentrations,

others at low concentrations. Unlike fiber races that have been selected to grow well at extremely high 
densities, drug strains tend to be less tolerant of high population densities (De Meijer 1994a).
Susceptibility to pests and diseases differs according to density of cultivation, and likely, there 
has been selection for tolerance to the usual cultivation density for particular kinds of C. sativa. 
The very dense plantations in which fiber crops are grown raises the humidity around the stalks 
and increases infections by fungal diseases. On the other hand, the dense canopy may be protective 
against many insects. By contrast, both drug and many oilseed crops are grown in open rows, and 
the increased sunlight is attractive to flea beetles and birds.
SHOOT ARCHITECTURE OF FIBER CROPS
Because fiber is produced mostly in the main stem (stalk) of C. sativa, and the longest fiber bundles 
are produced in the main stem, tall plants are best for harvest of fiber, and humans have been uncon-
sciously selecting tall plants for thousands of years. There has also sometimes been deliberate selec-
tion for height of fiber plants. Forster (1996) noted that to obtain seeds for planting fiber plants in

seeds while minimizing production of stem tissues, and to facilitate machine harvesting. Drawn by B. Flahey.

Chile, “During seed production, preferred males of ideal stature are selected and allowed to fertilize 
the females.” Such a procedure would strongly favor the development of tall plants. As discussed in 
Chapter 7 dealing with fiber production, branching is suppressed by growing the plants at extremely 
high densities (Figures 6.4 and 6.5). As detailed in Chapter 7, the slim, unbranched plants produced 
at high planting densities maximize quantity and quality of fiber. Woody tissues in the stem of fiber 
selections have been suppressed so that the stems are much hollower than in any other category of 
C. sativa. This makes the stems weaker and less flexible, but the high density of planting protects the 
plants from being lodged (blown over) by wind. Because of the limited branching, seed production 
is much more limited than in strains used for oilseed. However, sometimes, “dual-purpose” cultivars 
are grown (Figure 6.3d) with intermediate characteristics between the fiber (Figure 6.3c) and oilseed 
(Figure 6.3e) kinds, so that both products can be harvested, albeit in relatively modest amounts.
As discussed in Chapter 7, there are two basic kinds of fiber plants, European and Chinese. The 
latter, although much older, tends to be less selected specifically for stem fiber characteristics, as 
evidenced by the development of more branches, which produce more seed (Figure 6.6).
REDUCING THE HEIGHT OF MARIJUANA PLANTS
As discussed in Chapter 12, in Asia, one method of preparing hashish once often involved using 
hands or leather to collect (by adherence) sticky resin from the inflorescences at the top of the plants 
(alternatively and more conventionally today, hashish is prepared by filtering techniques, described 
in Chapter 12). Accordingly, strains suitable for hashish collection based on stickiness should not 
be too tall. As Bouquet (1950) recorded: “The cultivators, dressed in leather, moved about through 
the plantations. The resin sticks to their clothes, which are scraped from time to time with a blunt 
FIGURE 6.6 A Chinese fiber land race (note map in Figure 2.7 and discussion in Chapter 18). This plant is 
2.5 m in height. It was grown at a spacing of 1 m from other plants and is essentially open-grown. The strong 
lateral branching is typical of many Chinese land races (European fiber cultivars tend to be less branched). The 
appearance of this Chinese fiber plant is indistinguishable from most sativa type marijuana plants (see Chapter 18).

curved knife. This method of collection shows clearly that in those regions the plant does not grow 
to any great height.” In a similar vein today, dwarf varieties of tree fruits have been bred. An added 
benefit of low stature is greater wind resistance. The indica type group of marijuana strains is 
naturally much shorter (Figures 6.3a and 6.7) than the higher-stature sativa type of marijuana plant 
(Figure 6.3b), but as discussed in Chapter 12, the tall sativa type plants are more popular.
As discussed in Chapter 12, for the last half-century, marijuana plants have frequently been grown 
clandestinely indoors to avoid detection by law enforcement, a situation in which tall plants are fre-
quently too large (especially when overhead lighting and ventilation are installed in a room). Legitimate, 
authorized medicinal marijuana growers also often find tall plants to be too awkward to raise in green-
houses and specially fitted secure rooms. It is possible to adjust height by controlling the photoperiod, 
but plants that are naturally shorter are often grown where limited height is necessary (note Figure 6.8). 
“Breeders continue to develop early-maturing and high-yielding varieties that are short and compact for 
indoor grow room use and to avoid detection outdoors” (Clarke and Merlin 2013).
Indoor growers sometimes resort to removing the tops (Figure 6.9), pinching stem buds to pro-
mote branching, trellising, and other techniques to limit the height of plants (Clarke 1981). Potter 
(2009) observed that the height of indoor plants can be shortened by growing them under continu-
ous light or by brushing the plant in early development (like plants buffeted by wind, the stems 
become thicker and shorter to resist movement).
“Sea of Green” and “Screen of Green” cultivation MethodS
“Sea of Green” (SOG) and “Screen of Green” (or “SCOG” [Screen of Green Growing]) refer to 
indoor cultivation methods of inducing low continuous indoor marijuana canopies in order to maxi-
mize use of limited space.
FIGURE 6.8 Marijuana (C. sativa) growing in a mine shaft tunnel for the Canadian medical marijuana program. 
The limited stature of this strain was necessary to accommodate the limited height available. Similarly, growers 
of illicit marijuana have selected shorter strains that can be grown under artificial light in rooms with low ceilings.

Shoot and Foliage Architecture
Sea of Green is a method developed in the Netherlands that grows marijuana so that the buds 
mature and can be harvested while the plants are young, short, and well branched. Because illumina-
tion is intercepted mostly by the upper part of a marijuana plant, and the lower parts receive relatively 
limited amounts, the technique is a way of shortening the light-intercepting canopy so that most of it 
is well lit and growth is optimized. Effectively, this is a way of eliminating much of the lower leaves, 
which are somewhat parasitic on the plant when the plant is tall. Much more intense light is available 
outdoors, so the technique is intended for indoor growth. The method is based on growing a higher 
density of plants (for example, one plant per 30 cm2) than usually established but harvesting them 
faster. Productivity can be considerable (Knight et al. 2010). The tendency of strains to grow fast, tall, 
and/or branch and the maturation time will determine planting density. A wire or cord trellis may be 
spread horizontally over the canopy to support the heavy maturing branches, using twist ties to attach 
the branches to the trellis framework. Tying down the main stalk (leader) at a low level stimulates the 
growth of lower branches, promoting even filling in of the canopy. Some trimming may be necessary 
to encourage uniform development of the canopy, as well as openness below the canopy to allow ven-
tilation. Lower, senescing leaves should be removed to increase air circulation. The trellis should be 
positioned about 20 cm above the top of the growth medium.
SCOG is essentially the same as the SOG method but specifically employs a horizontal trellis 
(“screen”) through which plants grow. Training of plants tends to be more severe than in the SOG 
method, keeping the plant canopy short. (The vertical growth in SCOG is more limited than in 
SOG, the canopy of SOG described as a “forest” and that of SCOG as a “field.”) Chicken wire with 
5-cm openings is commonly employed as the screen, but nylon netting can also be used (although 
it is less sturdy).
These methods are labor intensive, more suitable for small spaces of limited height than for 
large grow rooms and for circumstances where maximum yield from limited lighting is desired. 
Not surprisingly, these techniques have been particularly employed for clandestine growth, where 
maximizing production in very limited indoor spaces is an imperative.

REDUCING THE HEIGHT OF FIBER PLANTS
Ranalli and Venturi (2004) and Amaducci (2005) describe a practice sometimes employed in Italy 
that dwarfs fiber hemp (producing so-called “baby hemp”) so that it can be processed by the same 
equipment used for the much shorter stems of flax. Seeds are sown at high density (100–120 kg/ha), 
and when the hemp stems are about 1.2 m tall, they are sprayed with desiccants (generally the 
herbicide glyphosate) to stop their growth. However, the process is considerably less efficient than 
normal hemp technology. Westerhuis et al. (2009) examined the possibility of producing dwarfed 
hemp simply by postponing the sowing date or of planting two successive short-season crops, and 
while the small plants so produced were quite usable for hemp fiber, the feasibility and economics 
of producing dwarf fiber plants have not seemed worthwhile.
Another curious technique to control height at harvest time was employed in the middle of the 
twentieth century in Russia (Kirby 1963). Because of very high demand for labor in the autumn, 
three different varieties that respectively matured very early, in mid-season, and in the fall were 
planted, thus distributing availability of workers and machinery throughout the growing season. An 
added advantage was that retting (described in Chapter 7) of summer-harvested stems proceeded 
more quickly, required less space, and produced higher-quality fiber in the warmer weather.
RESISTANCE TO CATASTROPHIC STEM DAMAGE
Cannabis sativa normally has a dominant leader stem that produces a central stalk. As discussed in 
this section, the species has an amazing capacity to recover from catastrophic damage to the main 
stem.
The European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis = ECB; Figure 6.10a) is a major Lepidopteran pest 
of C. sativa. Young larvae eat the leaves until the insects are half-grown and then bore holes into the 
stems. A typical entrance hole resulting from an attack on the main stem is shown in Figure 6.10b. The 
insect is indigenous to the Old World, where it apparently once reproduced mainly in association with 
Cannabis and its close relative Humulus (although also attacking many other plant species). It was not 
exposed to corn (i.e., maize, Zea mays), which is indigenous to the Americas, until post-Columbian 
times (“European hemp borer” would have been a better choice of name). In a study of infestation of 
a large experimental field, Small et al. (2007) discovered that ECB damage to C. sativa increased the 
shoot weight of the plant by 20%, concomitantly enlarging seed production, suggesting that C. sativa 
is adapted to the insect. The expanded productivity observed was due to branch proliferation at the 
site of the attack (see Figure 6.10c and d). Figure 6.10e shows silhouettes of a normal and an ECB-
damaged plant, and it is evident that the increased number of branches resulting from the damage has 
produced more biomass and more seeds. (The insect preferred larger stems but was unaffected by 
tetrahydrocannabinol content, which varied considerably in the experimental field.)
There is controversy whether insect damage may, at least in a limited sense, be good for plant 
productivity. McNaughton’s (1983) classic paper in this regard proposed that in some circumstances, 
plants can respond to herbivory by just growing faster (“compensation” or “overcompensation”). 
Verkaar (1986) surveyed papers purporting to support the hypothesis that grazing can have positive 
effects on plant growth and fitness and concluded that “the hypothesis may only be tenable under 
very particular circumstances.”
Horticulturally, it is well known that destroying leader buds to induce proliferation of flowers or 
fruits in a range of plants can increase productivity, so it is logical that insects that carry out this 
activity might also be beneficial to crop production. Moreover, as noted previously, humans have 
engaged in the practice of damaging stems to increase the productivity of C. sativa. Pate (1998b) 
observed that when growing hemp for seed, the number of flowers per plant and the number of seeds 
produced can be increased by topping the plants when 30 to 50 cm high. Dewey (1902) recorded that 
hemp grown in North America at the turn of the century was sometimes topped to make it spread 
and produce more seed. Moes (1998) found that following severe hail damage to a hemp plot in

Manitoba, axillary branches developed at nodes below damaged stems, produced inflorescences, 
and provided a substantial (albeit reduced) seed yield.
FOLIAGE ARCHITECTURE
There is great variation of the size of leaves and the shape of leaflets in C. sativa. The evolution and 
ecology of leaf size are complex subjects and are related to the total number of leaves and their turn-
over rate (e.g., Whitman and Aarssen 2010). In numerous plants, the leaves of domesticated forms 
are larger than is the case in related wild species. This is likely due to the greater photosynthetic 
capacity of large leaves, the result of selection by humans to be more productive in a given limited 
area. This pattern seems to be true for the three classes of domesticated Cannabis (fiber, oilseed, 
and marijuana), all of which tend to have larger leaves than do wild Cannabis plants. In Cannabis, 
compared to the foliage of wild plants, the photosynthetic area of individual leaves is often larger 
in domesticated plants by virtue of (1) having more leaflets and (2) having leaflets that are larger, 
especially wider (compare the wild leaves of Figure 6.11a and b with the domesticated leaf in Figure 
6.11c). This pattern of larger leaves with wider leaflets in domesticates compared to wild relatives is 
frequently encountered in other crops with compound leaves, for example, in carrot, Daucus carota 
L. (Small 1978b), and in alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. (Small 2011b). On the basis of modeling con-
siderations for tomato leaves, Sarlikioti et al. (2011) concluded that for a given leaf area, bigger but 
fewer leaflets were better at intercepting light than more but smaller leaflets.

Shoot and Foliage Architecture
Environment can modify leaf size. The leaves of many plant species growing in the wild are 
often small simply because of environmental modification—from the more stressful conditions 
encountered in nature. In Cannabis, however, the leaflets of wild plants are typically small even in 
excellent growth conditions. When fiber cultivars are grown closely together, as done convention-
ally, branching is suppressed and they lose most of their lower leaves. The fewer leaves that survive 
near the top of the plants are larger, partly as a matter of physiological compensation, but also as a 
genetically controlled tendency to produce larger leaves.
Some kinds of Chinese fiber land races and southern Asian (indica type) marijuana races are 
noted for their large leaves with wide leaflets—a clear reflection that they are the products of consid-
erable domestication. As discussed in Clarke and Merlin (2013), these groups are ancient and have 
undergone millennia of selection.
Larger leaves (and larger leaflets) in domesticated Cannabis may be the result of greater photo-
synthetic demand, but why should leaflets be narrower in related wild plants? Brown et al. (1991) 
examined the hypothesis that the feeding efficiency of leaf-eating insects is lowered on leaves 
that are small, dissected, or needle-like—patterns that make the insect work harder to reach the 
edible lamina. It seems possible that the smaller, narrower leaflets in wild plants of C. sativa 
are adaptive in making their foliage less accessible to herbivores, and the reduced need for such 
protection in domesticated plants has allowed them to develop bigger, wider leaflets. It is also 
possible that smaller and narrower leaflets are more resistant to wind damage, another advantage 
in wild plants.
As pointed out in Chapter 12, the two groups of marijuana plants differ in leaflet width, with 
sativa type plants having narrower leaflets than indica type plants. The underground marijuana 
literature sometimes also contends that the leaves of indica type plants tend to have fewer leaflets 
than those of sativa type. Coincidentally, indica type plants have much shorter internodes, result-
ing in pronounced crowding of the foliage and darker green foliage. These variables seem to be 
correlated in the same ways that shade leaves differ from sun leaves. Many plants develop smaller, 
lighter-green leaves in the sun and larger, darker-green leaves in the shade (e.g., Nobel 1976; Givnish 
1988), and the crowded (therefore shaded) leaves of indica type plants seem to be consistent with 
this observation.
PROTECTIVE UNICELLULAR HAIRS
Most of the above-ground plant surfaces of C. sativa, especially of the foliage, develop stiff, pointed 
hairs, technically termed “trichomes.” Glandular trichomes, which are multicellular, are discussed 
in Chapter 11. This chapter addresses two kinds of “simple” unicellular trichomes. Although can-
nabis material is almost always identified chemically for court purposes, the hairs have also been 
employed as identification features, as they frequently differ from hairs in other plants (Thornton 
and Nakamura 1972). In particular, the presence of rigid cystolithic hairs predominantly on the top 
of the leaves and relatively flexible simple hairs on the bottom is suggestive that herbal material is 
marijuana. The two kinds of hairs are described next.
cyStolithic trichoMeS
“Cystolithic” trichomes (Figure 6.12) are a mechanical defense against herbivores. By definition, 
such unicellular hairs have small particles of calcium carbonate embedded in the base (as shown in 
Figure 6.12a; “cystolith” is derived from the Greek kustis and lithos, meaning “bag of stones”). In 
Cannabis, cystolithic hairs are predominantly present on the adaxial (“upper”) surfaces of leaves. 
This feature tends to make the plant unpleasant to chew and less palatable to herbivores, protecting 
them from being eaten. Reinforcing this unpalatability is the presence of calcium oxalate crystals 
in many cells of the leaves (Figure 6.12b). Both calcium carbonate cystolithic hairs and calcium 
oxalate crystals are antiherbivore features which many other species of plants also possess.
 

88
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The hairs are also quite stiff, acting like miniature thorns. They tend to point toward the tip of 
leaves (Figure 6.12c), and because they are mostly orientated in the same direction, they provide 
a roughness to the surface of foliage, which probably discourages larger animals. This roughness 
is responsible for causing skin irritation and dermatitis in people who handle C. sativa extensively 
without suitable protective clothing.
SiMple trichoMeS
Also common on much of the plant are additional unicellular hairs that lack the basal stony concre-
tions and tend to be slimmer. These are silicified, tending to increase the unpalatability of the foliage. 
In Cannabis, simple hairs are present on both surfaces of leaves, but in young leaves, they can be 
dominant on the abaxial (“lower”) surface. These hairs also are protective as a physical barrier, 
insulating the foliage from insects, as illustrated in Figure 6.13. Insects tend to prefer the lower sur-
face of leaves, where they are relatively hidden from predators and where it is cooler, so protection 
of the lower leaf areas is particularly important.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• According to a traditional Japanese children’s story, Ninja warriors planted a batch of 
hemp when they began training, with the intent to leap over it every day. By the end of the 
season, the warriors were expected to jump over the 3–4 m (10–13 feet) high mature hemp.
• In the French Ardennes, it was thought to be absolutely essential that the women become 
drunk on the night of the first Sunday in Lent, in order that the hemp would grow tall.
• In medieval times in southwestern Germany, men and women leaped hand-in-hand over a 
bonfire, while calling for the hemp to grow. It was believed that those who jumped highest 
would cause the hemp on their farms to grow tallest.

INTRODUCTION TO FIBER
Hemp is a natural fiber, and to appreciate its current importance, it is desirable to have some background 
into the nature of fiber and the world market for it. “Fiber” has several meanings, but for purposes of 
this chapter, it refers to thread-like material, either obtained from natural sources or human-made, and 
used in various forms (especially woven into fabrics, matted as in paper, or glued together as in fiber-
board). Wood fiber provides over three-quarters of all fiber produced and also dominates the number 
of species that are available to produce fiber (wood fiber can be obtained from over 10,000 species of 
trees and over 1000 species of bamboo). Except for the category “manmade cellulosics,” wood fiber 
is excluded from the following analysis (see Figure 7.1). “Mineral fibers” (mostly made of glass, steel, 
asbestos, or carbon) are also excluded from this discussion. There are two basic classes of fiber: natural 
and synthetic. The world’s natural fiber market includes fibers extracted directly from plant and ani-
mal species. Cotton (from Gossypium species) and wool are the leading natural fibers. Other plant spe-
cies significant in world trade because they are deliberately cultivated for fiber include jute (Corchorus 
species), kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.), roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.), sunn hemp (Crotalaria 
juncea L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), ramie (Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaudich.), abaca (Musa textilis 
Née; = Manilla hemp, Manila hemp), sisal (Agave sisalina Perrine), and henequen (Agave fourcroydes 
Lem.). As illustrated in Figure 7.2, important vegetable fibers originate from different parts of plants 
(leaves, stems, seeds, fruits), depending on the species. Plant fibers are also obtained as by-products 
from crops, notably from straw left after cereals (particularly wheat, sorghum, and rice) are harvested, 
and from bagasse (the fibrous residue remaining after sugar from sugar cane is extracted). In contrast 
to natural fibers, synthetic fibers are prepared from fossil fuels. Examples include polyester, polypro-
pylene, and nylon. Manmade cellulosics is an intermediate category (sometimes included in synthetics 
and sometimes termed “regenerated fibers”); high-cellulose material, primarily salvaged from timber 
processing and crop residues (especially cotton), are chemically processed and converted to produce 
manufactured fibers. Rayon and acetate are examples. The world’s fiber market today is dominated by 
synthetic fibers, especially polyester, which is made mostly from ethylene derived from coal. Polyester 
constitutes three-quarters of all synthetic fibers. The world’s textile market generally uses fiber for 
fabrics, particularly for clothing. Cotton currently accounts for almost 40% of the total textile fiber 
market (and 85% of the natural fiber textile market), but polyester is more important, accounting for 
over 50% of the total textile fiber market. For years, polyester has been gaining market share while 
cotton has been losing ground. Animal fibers such as wool and silk, which are protein based, have also 
been losing popularity. Today, hemp constitutes only about 0.3% (on a tonnage basis) of the world’s 
natural fiber production (excluding wood fiber).
HISTORY
Ancient Hemp History
For most of recorded history, Cannabis sativa was primarily valued as a fiber source, considerably 
less so as an intoxicant, and only to a limited extent as an oilseed crop. Hemp is one of the oldest 
sources of textile fiber, with extant remains of hempen cloth trailing back at least six millennia. 
For thousands of years, hemp has been most valued for rope because of its strength, durability, and 
water resistance (Bócsa and Karus 1998).
Estimates of the time that hemp was harvested by the Chinese range from 6000 years (Li 1974) 
to 8500 years (Schultes 1970; Schultes and Hofmann 1980) or even 10,000 years (Allegret 2013).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
For millennia, hemp has been a respected crop in China (Touw 1981; Clarke and Merlin 2013), 
where it became a very important fiber for clothing (note Figure 7.3). The Chinese also manufac-
tured strings, ropes, textiles, and paper from hemp (Li 1974). To this day, China remains the world’s 
chief producer of hemp fiber.
Hemp grown for fiber was introduced to western Asia and Egypt and subsequently to Europe 
between 1000 and 2000 BC. Cultivation in Europe became widespread after 500 AD. The crop 
was first brought to South America in 1545, in Chile, and to North America in 1606, in Port Royal, 
Acadia (Small 1979b).

tHe Golden AGe of Hemp in tHe Western World
Hemp was one of the leading fiber crops of temperate regions from the sixteenth through the eigh-
teenth centuries. It was an important European crop until the middle of the nineteenth century. 
Hemp was widely used for rot-resistant, coarse fabrics as well as for paper, and was the world’s lead-
ing cordage fiber (used for rope, twine, and similar purposes) until the beginning of the nineteenth 
century. Until the middle of the nineteenth century, hemp rivaled flax as the chief textile fiber of 
vegetable origin and was described as “the king of fiber-bearing plants—the standard by which all 
other fibers are measured” (Boyce 1900).
Ships once used enormous amounts of hemp (Figure 7.4). Hemp was the raw material for sails 
because the fabric is very water and rot resistant. Most ship sailcloths, rigging, and nets up to the

late nineteenth century were made from hemp fiber. The “age of sailing ships” is usually defined for 
Western countries as lasting from the sixteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century (peaking in 
importance in the nineteenth century, the “Golden Age of Sailing”). During the age of sailing ships, 
Cannabis was considered to provide the very best canvas, and indeed this word, as well as the genus 
name Cannabis, is derived from the same ancient language words for hemp. A single ship could 
require as much as 60 tonnes of hemp rope—30 km for rigging alone; an anchor cable could exceed 
60 cm in diameter. To replace worn-out hemp materials, larger ships could require 100 tonnes of 
hemp fiber every year (Bócsa and Karus 1998).
tHe lAbor-intensive pre-tWentietH century period
Traditional planting, harvesting, and processing of hemp were astonishingly labor-intensive, as indi-
cated in Figure 7.5. In Europe, prisoners were often conscripted to process hemp. As shown in 
Figure 7.6, beating hemp stems to extract the fiber was a common form of hard labor in Victorian 
prisons. As shown in Figure 7.7a, “picking oakum” was another especially laborious task, needed to 
prepare the considerable amounts necessary to make ships water-tight (Figure 7.7b). Convicts were 
provided with worn-out ropes and were required to untwist them into corkscrew strands, unroll, 
and de-tar these into a fluffy mass of fibers, then roll the fibers from thigh to knee to produce a 
loosely twisted continuous strand. Only occupants of jails and poorhouses picked oakum, and the 
phrase “picking oakum” came to mean “getting into trouble.” When slavery and poorhouses were 
abolished, labor for preparing oakum became so limited that it contributed to the demise of hemp.
The hemp industry flourished in Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois between 1840 and 1860 because 
of the strong demand for sailcloth and cordage (Ehrensing 1998). From the end of the Civil War 
until 1912, virtually all hemp in the United States was produced in Kentucky (note Figure 7.8), and 
although simple machinery was adopted to facilitate collection and processing, a large labor force 
was still required. As documented by Hopkins (1951), slaves conducted the heavy labor prior to 
the American Civil War, and the diminishing production afterward was carried out by subsistence 
farmers and low-wage hired hands.
tHe tWentietH century GreAt demise of Hemp in tHe Western World
Several developments, listed in decreasing order of importance in the following, drastically cur-
tailed the importance of hemp fiber outside of Asia. (1) The use of steam- and petroleum-powered 
motorized ships greatly reduced the need for hemp fiber for naval purposes. (2) Hemp rope tends to 
hold water in the interior, and to prevent internal rotting, the ropes were tarred, a laborious process 
that was made unnecessary when abaca was substituted. Abaca rope proved preferable for marine 
use because it was lighter, could float, and had greater resistance to salt water corrosion. (3) The 
Industrial Revolution (approximately 1760–1840 in Britain) initiated sustained economic growth 
and living standards in the Western world but also accentuated differences for the cost of fiber 
production between rich temperate regions and poor tropical and semitropical regions. As a fiber 
crop, hemp (like flax) is best adapted to temperate areas, in contrast to other leading fiber crops 
such as cotton, jute, and sisal. Outside of Asia, production costs (largely determined by labor) in 
recent centuries have been much cheaper for tropical and semitropical fiber crops, and this contrib-
uted to making hemp much less competitive. (4) Hemp fiber was once important for production of 
coarse but durable clothing fabric. In the nineteenth century, softer fabrics took over the clothing 
market. As the world has judged, cotton is a remarkably more attractive choice for apparel. The 
invention of the modern cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 enormously increased the efficiency of 
cotton production and has been claimed to have contributed to the demise of hemp fiber, which is 
relatively difficult to separate cleanly from other parts of the plant. Increasing limitation of cheap 
labor for traditional production in Europe and the New World led to the creation of some mechani-
cal inventions for preparing hemp fiber, but too late to counter growing interest in competitive

crops. (5) Human-made fibers began influencing the marketplace with the development of rayon 
from wood cellulose in the 1890s. Largely during the twentieth century, commercial synthetic fiber 
technology increasingly became dominant (acetate in 1924, nylon in 1936, acrylic in 1944, polyester 
in the 1950s), providing competition for all natural fibers, not just hemp. (6) Hemp rag had been 
much used for paper, but the nineteenth century introduction of the chemical woodpulping process 
considerably lowered demand for hemp. (7) A variety of other, minor usages of hemp became 
obsolete. For example, the use of hemp as a waterproof packing (oakum), once desirable because

of resistance to water and decay, became antiquated. (8) The growing use of the cannabis plant as 
a source of marijuana drugs in the Western world in the early twentieth century gave hemp a very 
bad image and led to legislation prohibiting cultivation of hemp (note Figure 7.9). During the two 
World Wars, there were brief revivals of hemp cultivation by both the allies and Germany because 
of difficulties importing tropical fibers. In particular, abaca and sisal fiber from the Philippines 
and Netherlands Indies were cut off in late 1941, and there was a concerted effort to reestablish the 
industry in the United States (Wilsie et al. 1942, 1944; Hackleman and Domingo 1943; note Figure 
7.10). In 1952, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a revision of Robinson’s (1935) guide 
to cultivating hemp in the United States but lost interest in the crop subsequently. After the war, 
however, hemp cultivation essentially ceased in most of Western Europe, all of North America, and 
indeed in most non-Asian countries, although production continued at a diminished level in Asia, 
eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union.

tHe recent renAissAnce
In Asia (particularly in China), in most of the Soviet Union, and in most of Eastern Europe, hemp cultiva-
tion was not prohibited as it was in most of the remaining world during the twentieth century. In these 
areas, hemp production continued to a lesser or greater degree depending on local markets (Ceapoiu 
1958; De Meijer et al. 1995). A surge of interest in reestablishing the hemp industry in Western countries 
began in the 1990s, particularly in Europe and the British Commonwealth. At the time, governments 
generally were hostile to growing any form of C. sativa for fear that this was a subterfuge for making 
marijuana more acceptable. Throughout Western nations in the 1990s, interest in reviving traditional 
nondrug uses of C. sativa, as well as developing new uses, has had to contend with the dominating image 
of the plant as a source of marijuana. Nevertheless, cultivation resumed in the temperate-climate regions 
of many Western countries. Examples of first resumption of cultivation include the following: Australia 
(Tasmania), 1990; Austria, 1995; Canada, 1998; England, 1993; Germany, 1995; the Netherlands, 1994; 
Spain, 1986; Sweden, 1995. Some Western European countries, such as France and Spain, never prohib-
ited hemp cultivation and also participated in the 1990s in the revival of hemp cultivation. The impetus 
for growing hemp in the West was economic, motivated by the general need to find new profitable crops. 
Critical to the successful initiation of hemp cultivation in most countries was persuasion of governments 
that the hemp industry would not compromise programs controlling forms of Cannabis that could be 
used to produce marijuana. About three dozen countries currently grow significant commercial hemp 
crops. As of 2016, the United States has been the only notable Western nation to persist in prohibiting 
hemp cultivation, although, the majority of U.S. states have enacted resolutions or legislation favoring 
the resumption of hemp cultivation, and cultivation has been initiated in some states. However, federal 
U.S. laws have precedence. The reluctance to authorize hemp cultivation has been particularly related to 
continuing suspicion that cultivating hemp would facilitate and promote “narcotic” usage of the species 
(Figure 7.11). There has been a widespread perception in the United States that those promoting indus-
trial hemp are pro-marijuana interest groups. Indeed, “Groups such as the National Organization for the 
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) have picked up the hemp crusade in order to claim the benefits of 
industrial hemp as an advantage of marijuana legalization” (Caulkins et al. 2012).

THE TWO BASIC CLASSES OF STEM FIBER: 
PHLOEM (BAST) AND XYLEM (WOOD)
Two basic classes of fiber occur in the stems of C. sativa: phloem (bast) fiber and xylem (wood) 
fiber, illustrated in Figure 7.12. These are associated with the two vascular (fluid transportation) sys-
tems of plants: xylem tissue, which functions to transport water and solutes from the roots to other 
parts of the plant, and phloem tissue, which transports photosynthetic metabolites from the foliage 
to nourish other parts of the plant. Additional details on these fibers are presented in the following 
discussion.
ANATOMY OF THE STEM
tHe economicAlly importAnt stem tissues
Three kinds of fiber cells in the stems of C. sativa are of economic value: primary phloem, second-
ary phloem, and xylem. The fiber cells of hemp are alive initially but die at maturity as their cell 
walls become blocked by deposit of lignin. The very valuable primary phloem (bast) fibers are initi-
ated in the apical meristem at the tip of the growing main stem (Figure 7.13, left) and subsequently 
elongate (much more so in the internodes, i.e., between the nodes where the leaves arise). The pri-
mary phloem fibers are slightly separated from the epidermis of the stem by several layers of cells 
making up the cortex (Figures 7.13 through 7.15). Upon the completion of internode elongation, a 
cambium (thin cylinder of meristematic tissue running the length of the stem), located internally to 
the primary fibers, produces (a) secondary phloem fibers toward the outside of the stem (but inside 
the primary phloem fibers) and (b) xylem (woody hurds tissue) toward the center of the stem.
As a result of the growth processes described previously, the mature hemp stem consists of 
several concentric cylinders of tissue (see Figures 7.13 through 7.15). The multicellular cortex is

FIGURE 7.12 The two basic classes of fiber in the stem. The top of this hemp stem was subjected to ret-
ting (decomposition of the softer tissues), separating the phloem (bast) fiber from the woody core, which is 
composed of xylem fiber. The phloem fibers are amalgamated into bundles; note how these bundles intersect 
to form a net-like supportive girdle. As discussed in the text, the woody core provides vertical strength, while 
the phloem fiber network provides flexibility, preventing excessive bending and torsion. Compare Figure 7.18.

found immediately internal to the unicellular epidermis; as with other stem fiber crops, removal 
of the cortex (not to be confused with “decortication” described later) by “retting” (also described 
later) is a key initial step in fiber extraction (a partly retted hemp stem is shown in Figure 7.12). 
Internal to the cortex is the primary phloem fiber tissue, in which the principal fiber of interest is 
found; the primary fibers are amalgamated into rope-liked “bundles.” Internal to the primary fiber 
bundles (toward the center of the stem) are the secondary phloem fibers, which are also amalgam-
ated into bundles. The secondary phloem fiber is of considerably lower quality than the primary 
fiber. Because secondary fiber bundles are more common in the lower third of the mature stem, 
the upper third of the stem produces higher-quality fiber than the lower third. The next significant 
concentric layer is the cambium, a meristematic tissue that generates the secondary fiber toward the 
outside and the wood (xylem) tissue toward the stem center. A pith made up of undifferentiated cells 
initially occupies the center of the very young stems. As the cambium produces the woody xylem 
toward the center, the pith is crushed and degenerated. The center of the pith becomes hollow, but 
only to a limited extent at the internodes (where the leaves arise), and even less so toward the base 
of the stalk. The woody tissue and the remnants of the pith constitute the “hurds.”
AmbiGuities reGArdinG stem tissue AnAtomicAl terms
The pith remnants constitute less than 1% of the hurds, but in some descriptions, the entire hurds 
are mistakenly called pith. The phrase “woody core” is often applied to all tissues internal to the 
cambium, and the phrases “woody fibers” and “wood fibers” pertain to the hurd fibers. “Shives” 
rather than “hurds” is more often used for flax than for hemp, and “core” is more frequently 
applied to kenaf and jute. The term “bark” is often used to indicate all stem tissues external to the 
cambium, so that “bast fibers” is synonymous with “bark fibers” (De Meijer 1994a; De Meijer and 
Keizer 1996a).

priced products. Prepared by B. Brookes.

HOW THE THREE KINDS OF FIBER CONTRIBUTE TO STEM STRENGTH
Tall stems such as occur in C. sativa require structural support, and the three kinds of fibers are 
important in this respect.
Xylem fiber
In trees, wood tissues (which include very tough tracheid cells) are responsible for the vertical strength 
of the stem, and indeed, in C. sativa, wood tissue (the “hurds” described previously) occupying the 
central part of the stem is also the main source of strength. The wood fibers of C. sativa are notably 
shorter than the phloem fibers and are significantly stiffer and less flexible. Like the trunk of a tree, 
the stalk becomes thicker (and woodier) toward the base, for support. The stalk may exceed 50 mm

in diameter in uncrowded plants, but in thick stands, the stalk usually varies from 6 to 20 mm. The 
progressive thickness toward the base is due mostly to more hurd tissue being formed.
primAry pHloem fiber
As noted previously, primary phloem fibers glued together in fiber bundles occur in the outermost 
part of the stem. The phloem fibers (both primary and secondary) serve only to a limited extent to 
supplement vertical stem strength; their principal function is to provide flexibility so that the stem 
can bend but not break in response to wind and other environmental forces. The very high tensile 
strength of the phloem fibers limits bending and turning (torque). The long axis of the phloem fibers 
is more or less parallel to the stem axis—an arrangement that naturally keeps the stem upright and 
resists stem bending.
secondAry pHloem fiber
As noted previously, secondary phloem fibers glued together in fiber bundles develop between the 
outer primary fiber bundles and the internal xylem. The secondary fibers are much shorter than 
the primary fibers, and the secondary fiber bundles are smaller in diameter than the primary fiber 
bundles. Because the primary phloem fibers stop being formed when the stem is young and slim, 
the secondary fibers take on the task of adding to the growing need for strength of the stem as it 
enlarges. As noted previously, the progressive thickness of the stem toward the base is due mostly 
to more hurd tissue being formed, but this woody tissue is supplemented toward the base of the 
stalk by secondary fibers. Because females live longer than males, they develop thicker, stronger 
phloem fiber cells and more secondary fiber bundles than do the males. Proportionately, males have 
a greater amount of primary fiber in the stems, resulting in higher quality.
LIGNIFICATION

strength to fiber cell bundles as they age (Ros Barceló 1997). This has mixed benefits: it decreases 
overall fiber quality, increasing the tensile strength of the fibers but reducing break and torque resis-
tance and elasticity (Bócsa and Karus 1998).
FIBER QUALITIES
The primary bast fibers (Figure 7.16) are the most valuable product of the stems. Measuring 
3–55 μm long (Van der Werf 1994a) or up to 100 μm according to Crônier et al. (2005), they 
are among the longest cells found in plants. They are 7 to 50 μm in diameter and are amalgam-
ated in fiber bundles (do not confuse these bundles of cells with the fibril bundles or with the 
microfibril bundles noted next), which can be 1–5 m long, although averaging only about 30 μm 
in diameter (Shahzad 2012). The fibers in the bundles are cemented together by a complex mix-
ture of pectins, hemicelluloses, and smaller amounts of lignin. Hemp fiber cells are made up of 
“microfibrils”—bundles of cellulose molecule chains; the microfibrils are themselves organized 
in bundles (“fibrils”) oriented in a helical pattern along the length of the fiber. The fibers are 
notable for their high tensile strength (Fan 2010), due substantially to their thick, cellulosic sec-
ondary wall and their low microfibril angle (Mohanty et al. 2000). (“Microfibril angle” is the 
angle between the direction of the helical windings of cellulose microfibrils in the secondary cell 
wall of fibers and tracheids and the long axis of the cell. A low angle, i.e., the microfibril orien-
tation is close to the fiber axis, increases strength.) As noted earlier, the primary phloem fibers 
arise as cells near the shoot apex and continue to elongate, growing intrusively through other stem 
tissues that have stopped growth. Thickening of the secondary wall continues until the internal 
part of the cell (lumen) is almost entirely filled and the cell dies. The degree of elongation, thick-
ness of the cells wall, and hence strength of the cells are modifiable somewhat by environmental 
conditions (Schäfer and Honermeier 2006). Van der Werf (1993), reporting on Ukrainian hemp, 
stated, “Many of the cultivars which have a high fiber content in the stem have been found to have 
larger fiber bundles than the older cultivars which have a low fiber content. Large fiber bundles 
are undesirable as they decrease fiber fineness, one of the most important quality parameters for 
cordage and textile purposes.”
As the stem matures, the cambium produces additional (secondary) bast fibers, which are short 
(about 2 mm long), about 25 μm wide, and more lignified. The woody core fibers of the hurds are 
even shorter, 0.5–0.6 mm long, and like hardwood fibers are cemented together with considerable 
lignin. The secondary bast fibers are of notably smaller value than the primary bast fibers, and in 
50 µm

Fiber
turn, the woody core is of still lesser value. The secondary bast fiber bundles tend to adhere to the 
woody core, and so some of this fraction is difficult to separate.
Various authors differ in their reports on the composition of the fiber and hurds. Gümüşkaya et 
al. (2007) reported that the bast fibers are 57%–77% cellulose, 9%–14% hemicellulose, and 5%–9% 
lignin, while the hurd fibers are 40%–48% cellulose, 18%–24% hemicellulose, and 21%–24% lig-
nin. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Additives and Products or Substances 
Used in Animal Feed (2011) reported that the fiber contains 80%–83% cellulose (presumably 
including hemicellulose) and 17%–20% lignin, while the hurds contain 35% cellulose, 18% hemi-
cellulose, and 21% lignin. De Groot et al. (1994) reported that the hurds contain 33%–37% cellulose, 
16%–20% hemicelluloses, and 17%–22% lignin. Van der Werf et al. (1994a) stated that the lignin 
content in hemp varies from 4% in the bast fraction to 21% in the hurds fraction.
Both genetic and environmental conditions determine stem dimensions, as well as size and 
chemical characteristics of the bast fibers of economic interest for fiber hemp. These aspects of the 
stem are also determined to some extent by growth conditions. Diameter of stem, size of bast fibers, 
and chemical content of fiber are determined to some extent by growth conditions, particularly density 
of planting (for literature, see Bócsa and Karus 1998; Amaducci et al. 2005; and Khan et al. 2011). The 
stems of plants grown very closely (12 cm apart) may be only 4 mm in diameter, while the stems of 
the same variety grown well spaced (45 cm apart) may be as thick as 26 mm (Bócsa and Karus 1998). 
Physical and mechanical properties of the fibers differ among the bottom, middle, and top of the stems 
(Li et al. 2013). Breeding is important to create cultivars with improved fiber fineness, tensile strength, 
and other qualities, but production and processing technologies are thought to be critical in making 
best use of the natural qualities of hemp fiber (Müssig 2003; Finta-Korpel’ová and Berenji 2007).
Time of harvest affects fiber quality. Centuries of experience have resulted in hemp being har-
vested for fiber while it is in early flower. This was confirmed by Liu et al. (2015), who found that 
“Fibers harvested at the beginning of flowering exhibited high tensile strength and strain, which 
decreased with plant maturity. Reduction in strength was related to the increase in proportion of 
secondary fibers and decrease in cellulose deposition leading to inferior properties of fibers.”
Hemp long fiber is one of the strongest and most durable of natural fibers, with high tensile 
strength, wet strength, resistance to decay, and other characteristics that make it technically suited for 
various industrial products (Hemptech 1995; Karus and Leson 1996). Hemp fiber dyes well, resists 
mildew, blocks ultraviolet light, conducts heat, absorbs water well, and has natural antibacterial prop-
erties. Both the long, lignin-poor bast fibers and the hurds have considerable applications, as detailed 
later. As will be noted, depending on technology used, the hurds are not completely separated from 
the bast during retting. Frequently, bast fibers remaining attached to the hurds increase the quality of 
the hurds, and conversely, hurds imperfectly separated from the bast decrease the quality of the latter.
There is increasing demand for lightweight, biodegradable, sustainably produced, recyclable mate-
rials that can be used alone or in composites, and hemp fiber seems to have excellent properties in 
these respects (Small 2014b). Shahzad (2012) reviewed the industrial qualities of hemp fiber and came 
to the following conclusions: (1) The natural strength and stiffness of hemp fiber are very desirable for 
reinforcement of composite materials. (2) The mechanical properties of hemp fibers are comparable to 
those of glass fibers, but their biggest disadvantage is variability of properties. (3) Composites made of 
hemp fibers with thermoplastic, thermoset, and biodegradable matrices have exhibited good mechani-
cal properties. (4) Several surface treatments applied to improve fiber/matrix interfacial bonding have 
resulted in considerable improvements in the mechanical properties of composites.
FIBER EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGIES
As with other bast fiber crops, the most desirable (“long”) fibers are found in the phloem-associated 
tissues. The traditional and still major first step in fiber extraction is to ret (“rot”) away the softer 
parts of the plant, by exposing the harvested stems to microbial decay in the field (“dew retting,” 
shown in Figure 7.17) or submerging the stems in water (“water retting,” shown in Figure 7.5b).

Fiber
During retting, certain bacteria or fungi selectively remove pectic substances that bind the fibers to 
less desirable parts of the stem (the cellulose, which makes up most of the fiber cells, is very resistant 
to decay). The result is to slough off the outer parts of the stem and to loosen the inner woody core 
(the “hurds”) from the phloem fiber bundles (Figure 7.18). Water retting, which produces higher-
quality fiber than dew retting, has been largely abandoned in countries where labor is expensive or 
environmental regulations exist. Water retting, typically by soaking the stalks in ditches, can lead 
to a high level of pollution and bad odor of the wastewater because of organic fermentation. Most 
hemp fiber used in textiles today is water retted in China (Zhang et al. 2008). Retting in tanks rather 
than in open bodies of water helps to control the effluents. Unlike flax, hemp long fiber requires 
water retting for preparation of high-quality spinnable fibers for production of very fine textiles.
Occasionally, hemp is “stand retted”—the standing crop is dehydrated by the application of 
a desiccant herbicide and retting occurs while the crop is erect (and dead). Rarely, hemp is frost 
retted —the stems are allowed to ret outdoors overwinter. A variety of experimental retting techniques 
have also been attempted, such as retting in plastic bags (Li et al. 2009) and ensilage (Idler and Pecenka 
2007; Idler et al. 2011). Avoiding retting entirely by processing freshly harvested stems directly into 
products has been proposed (Idler et al. 2011) and, at least in theory, is an attractive possibility.
As with other bast fiber crops, hemp phloem fibers are arranged in bundles parallel to the stem 
axis and are embedded in a pectic polysaccharide network. The pectin network cementing the fibers 
together is the major obstacle to obtaining high-quality fiber. Traditional water retting is effective 
because bacteria that are present secrete pectinolytic enzymes; filamentous fungi producing pecti-
nase are more important in dew retting. A commonly used technique to improve fiber separation is 
chemical processing with sodium hydroxide or diluted sulphuric acid. Steam explosion is a poten-
tial technology that has been experimentally applied to hemp (Garcia-Jaldon et al. 1998). Material 
separated into crude phloem fiber bundles is the raw material, and this is subjected to steam under 
pressure and increased temperature, which “explodes” (separates) the fibers so that one has a more 
refined (thinner) hemp fiber that currently is only available from water retting. The high tempera-
ture and moisture soften the fibers and hydrolyze the pectins and hemicellulose, so that there are 
both mechanical and chemical changes associated with steam explosion. Still additional poten-
tial methods that have been considered to augment or replace traditional retting include ultrasonic 
techniques, enzymatic retting (Pakarinen et al. 2012), and the use of selected or improved decay 
FIGURE 7.18 A hemp stem, bent sharply after retting, breaking the woody central portion (hurds), leaving

microorganisms (Tamburini et al. 2004; Thygesen et al. 2005; Valladares Juárez et al. 2009; Di 
Candilo et al. 2010).
As mentioned previously, removal of the cortex (the tissue external to the desired phloem fiber) 
by retting is a key initial step in fiber extraction. “Decortication” (the term not referring to the cor-
tex tissue) refers to a mechanical force (bending, shearing, impacting, or kinking) that separates 
the high-quality, flexible, outer phloem fibers from the low-quality, stiff, and more brittle woody 
fibers (hurds) in the internal part of the stem. In traditional hemp processing, the long fiber was 
separated from the internal woody hurds in two steps, breaking (stalks were crushed to loosen the 
adherence between the internal hurds and the external long fibers; this was accomplished in the 
past with mechanical tools but in more recent times by using rollers that broke the woody core into 
short pieces) and scutching (mechanical beating to remove the hurds). These mechanical forces can 
separate not just most of the hurds but also the short (secondary phloem) fibers (“tow”) and long 
(primary phloem) fibers (“line fiber,” “long-line fiber”). A single, relatively expensive “decorticator 
machine” can carry out all of these processes.
For highest-quality fiber (generally for clothing), as shown in Figure 7.19, hemp needs not only 
to be scutched (removal of most of the hurds from the phloem fiber) but also hackled (“hackles” 
are steel “brushes” traditionally used to separate the fibers; see Figure 7.20). Hackling additionally 
combs the fibers, making them align in parallel, and removes remaining pieces of stalks, broken 
fibers, and extraneous material. However, mostly for nontextile applications, cruder alternatives 
may be employed to produce a less pure grade of fiber. This involves production of “whole fibers” 
(i.e., harvesting both the long fibers from the cortex and the shorter fibers from throughout the stem) 
and technologies that utilize shortened hemp fibers. The approach is currently dominant in Western 
Europe and Canada and commences with field dew retting (typically two to three weeks). A princi-
pal limitation is climate—the local environment should be suitably but not excessively moist at the 
close of the harvest season. Once stalks are retted, dried, and baled, they are processed to extract 
the fiber. In general, in the European Union (EU) and Canada, fibers are not separated into tow and 
line fibers but are left as “whole fiber.” Based on experience in the EU, where the “fiber line” prod-
uct may contain 2%–25% hurds that were not separated, the production of 1.0 kg of fiber product 
produces 1.7 kg of separated hurds as a by-product (Carus et al. 2013). In the EU, the bast fiber sells 
for about twice the value of the hurds (Carus et al. 2013). In the EU, highly purified fiber (with only 
2%–3% hurds) is employed for automotive applications (described later), while the less purified fiber 
(with 25% hurds) is used in cigarette paper. In Western Europe, the fiber is often “cottonized,” i.e., 
chopped into short segments the size of cotton and flax fiber, so that the fibers can be processed on 
flax processing machinery, which is very much better developed than such machinery is for hemp.

HOW DOMESTICATION HAS ALTERED CANNABIS 
SATIVA FOR FIBER PRODUCTION
Fiber hemp plants, in contrast with C. sativa plants grown for marijuana or oilseed, and also 
in contrast with wild plants, have been selected for features maximizing stem fiber production. 
Selection for fiber has resulted in strains that have much more primary phloem fiber and much 
less woody core than encountered in marijuana strains, oilseed cultivars, and wild plants. Fiber 
varieties may have less than half of the stem made up of woody core, while in nonfiber strains, 
more than three-quarters of the stem can be woody core (De Meijer 1994a). Moreover, in fiber 
plants, more than half of the stem exclusive of the woody core can be fiber, while nonfiber plants 
rarely have as much as 15% fiber in the corresponding tissues. Also important is the fact that 
in fiber selections, most of the fiber can be the particularly desirable long primary fibers (De 
Meijer 1995a).
Since the stem nodes tend to disrupt the length of the fiber bundles, thereby limiting quality, 
tall, relatively unbranched plants with long internodes have been selected. Another strategy has 
been to select stems that are especially hollow at the internodes (Figure 7.21, right), with lim-
ited hurds, since this maximizes the production of long phloem fiber (although the decrease in 
woody tissues makes the stems less resistant to lodging by wind). Similarly, limited seed pro-
ductivity concentrates the plant’s energy into production of fiber, and fiber cultivars often have 
low genetic propensity for seed output. Selecting monoecious strains overcomes the problem of 
differential maturation times and quality of male and female plants (males mature one to three 
weeks earlier). Male plants in general are taller, albeit slimmer, less robust, and less productive 
(although they tend to have superior fiber). Except for the troublesome characteristic of dying 
FIGURE 7.20 A hackle employed for aligning and cleaning raw hemp fiber. In general, hackles are combs

after anthesis, male traits are favored for fiber production. In former, labor-intensive times, 
the male plants were harvested earlier than the females, to produce the best fiber. Fiber strains 
have been selected to grow well at extremely high densities, which increases the length of the 
internodes (contributing to fiber length) and increases the length of the main stem (contributing 
to fiber bundle length) while limiting branching (making harvesting easier). The high density 
of stems also contributes resistance to lodging, desirable because woody supporting hurd tissue 
has been decreased by selection. The limited branching of fiber cultivars is often compensated 
for by possession of large leaves with wide leaflets, which increase the photosynthetic ability 
of the plants.
Since fiber plants have not generally been selected for drug purposes, the level of intoxicating 
constituents is often limited, usually much less than 1%. However, some hemp strains grown in 
subtropical Asia (where fiber hemp is a very minor crop and the strains are mostly unimproved land 
races with fiber content below 20%) are of variable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content and may 
have a content of THC as high as 3%.
FIGURE 7.21 Cross-sections of stems at internodes of a fiber plant (right) and of a marijuana plant (left). 
Fiber cultivars have stems that are more hollow at the internodes, i.e., with less woody tissues, since this allows 
more energy to be directed into the production of phloem fiber.

ECONOMIC PRODUCTS
Clothing and paper are the traditional hemp consumer products, and these are mostly obsolescent, 
although there are attempts to resurrect these items for niche and boutique markets (Figure 7.22). 
However, as presented in the following, a variety of quite new applications have revived the hemp 
fiber industry.
teXtiles, fAbrics, And clotHinG
“Textiles,” “fabrics,” and “clothing” refer to sheets of fiber networks prepared by weaving, pressing 
(to make felts), or bonding; none of these ambiguous terms necessarily distinguishes woven from 
nonwoven products. Although quite expensive, hemp clothing and other woven products (Figures 
7.23 and 7.24) have a natural appeal to a sector of the population that considers them desirable sim-
ply because hemp seems to be an especially sustainable crop or because purchasing hemp goods

is viewed as a way of expressing approval of marijuana. Hemp clothes are resistant to abrasion but 
are typically abrasive because of relatively coarse and nonhomogeneous fiber bundles and so have 
been used historically for outer garments and work apparel (Bócsa and Karus 1998) and, sadly, for 
prisoners and slaves. However, appropriate processing and blending with other natural fibers can 
significantly improve the “feel” of hemp, and sources in China supply hemp textile blends indistin-
guishable from fine linens in texture.
Hemp fiber sufficiently cleaned of hurds to be suitable for textiles (“textile grade fiber”) is produced 
primarily in China and to a smaller extent in France and several east European countries. Weaving 
of hemp fiber into textiles and apparel is primarily done in China. Production of fine hemp fabrics 
is insignificant in the EU and North America. Outside of China, processing costs are higher than for 
other fibers, because hemp fibers vary from the standard specifications for length and diameter estab-
lished for the equipment used in most textile and apparel factories, necessitating the use of specialty 
machines. The hemp apparel industry outside of China is based on fiber, yarn, and fabrics imported 
from eastern Europe and China. China’s established extraction technology and spinning facilities, 
to say nothing of much lower labor costs, make it very difficult to develop a hemp textile industry 
in Europe and North America. The fact that spinning facilities for natural fibers are so concentrated 
in China makes it almost impossible to competitively produce hemp fabrics elsewhere. In theory, 
a domestic hemp textile industry could be established outside of China, by developing specialized 
harvesting, processing, spinning, and weaving equipment and perhaps new technologies. In practice, 
China controls the hemp textile market and probably will remain dominant for the foreseeable future.
In addition to textiles used in clothing, coarser woven cloth (canvas) made with hemp is used for 
upholstery, bags, sacks, and tarpaulins. Such products can be manufactured from a relatively crude 
grade of hemp fiber without weaving. In both the EU and North America, there is production of 
nonwoven, relatively coarse fabric-like materials (e.g., Figure 7.25) using hemp fiber. Needle punch 
carpets (made by using barbed needles to assemble a web of compacted, interlocked fibers) are usu-
ally constructed today with synthetic fibers, but there is interest in using hemp fiber. Alternatively, 
the fibers in nonwoven carpets can be held together by thermosetting methods. Composites using 
hemp in combination with other natural fibers, postindustrial plastics, or other types of resins are 
being used to produce nonwoven matting for padding (for example, for mattresses and futons), 
backing for woven carpets, sound insulation, lining of cribs and pens for young livestock, and other 
applications.
Since European cultivation of hemp is substantial, there is fairly extensive production of such 
nonwoven products in the EU. However, hemp is grown mostly for oilseed in Canada (hence in North 
America), so a nonwoven hemp industry is much less developed. Stemergy (originally Hempline), in 
Ontario, Canada, the first firm to grow hemp for commercial purposes in North America since the

hemp fiber for upholstery and carpeting, and several other Canadian enterprises are also interested 
in hemp primarily as a fiber rather than as an oilseed.
substrAtes for plAnt GroWtH
Horticultural Planting Media
Plants are often grown initially from seeds germinated in porous, water-retaining material used as 
substitutes for soil (fertilization is of course necessary) and then transplanted to regular soil. Some 
crops, such as cress, are raised to maturity in soilless materials. Peat is the most widely used organic 
substrate. Plant wastes, rockwool, and synthetic materials are also used. In recent years, hemp fiber 
has been added to this market niche.
Biodegradable Mulch
“Mulch” refers to material layered onto a soil surface to improve growth of plants (by conserving 
moisture, either lowering soil temperature or retaining heat, improving soil fertility and health, 
and preventing weed growth) or simply to enhance visual appearance. Common friable or granular 
mulch materials include compost, bark chips, wood chips, and gravel. Pulverized hemp hurds are 
sometimes used as a mulch but are not competitive for this purpose.
Unlike the materials discussed in the previous paragraph, mulches can also be continuous, and 
plastic sheeting is common for this purpose. At present, the main ground-covering, sheet-like mulches 
are polymeric (polythene, spun-blown polypropylene), but some are made of glass fiber or natural 
fibers. Both woven and nonwoven fabrics can be used; woven and knitted materials are stronger and 
the open structure may be advantageous (e.g., in allowing plants to grow through), but nonwovens are 
cheaper and better at suppressing weeds. Sheet-like mulches made from fibers, whether woven or not, 
are widely used for crops and are sometimes referred to as “agricultural textiles” and “geotextiles” 
(although “textiles” are usually understood to be woven). “Mulch fleece” (pressed, nonwoven fiber 
blanket) is sometimes made of hemp fiber and is popular in the EU marketplace (Carus et al. 2013).
Flax and hemp fibers exposed to water and soil have been claimed to disintegrate rapidly over the 
course of a few months, which would make them unacceptable for products that need to have long-
term stability when exposed to the elements. Coco (coir; Cocos nucifera L.) fiber has been said to 
be much more suitable, due to higher lignin content (40%–50%, compared to 2%–5% in some bast 
fibers). Coir is much cheaper than flax and hemp fibers. However, this evaluation does not do justice 
to the developing hemp mulch market. The degree of rot resistance of hemp fiber makes its use in 
ground matting desirable for certain applications because the ability to last outdoors for many years 
is frequently undesirable. For example, the widespread current use of plastic netting to reinforce 
grass sod is quite objectionable, the plastic persisting for many years and interfering with lawn care.
cordAGe products
String and rope manufactured from hemp (Figure 7.26) are available from specialty outlets, but 
except for certain applications, hemp cordage is largely obsolete. Hemp ropework is used to make 
hemp hammocks, which are popular, and take advantage of the natural strength, water resistance, 
and decay resistance of hemp fiber. Hemp fiber is sometimes employed to make biodegradable twine 
to replace plastic ties used to attach plants to supporting poles.
pressed And molded fiber products
Molded and pressed (nonwoven) natural fiber products, with or without the addition of bonding media, 
are extensively used for a wide range of applications (Figure 7.27). While many different fibers can be 
used, hemp fiber (both phloem and hurd) has become a significantly basic resource in Europe.

The oldest surviving paper is over 2000 years of age, comes from China, and was made from hemp 
fiber (Fleming and Clarke 1998). Egyptian papyrus sheets might be thought to be an older form of 
paper but are not “paper” as this term is understood by experts because the fiber strands are woven, 
not “wet-laid” (Van Roekel 1994; Van Roekel et al. 1995). Until the early nineteenth century, hemp 
and flax were the chief paper-making materials. Wood-based paper came into use when mechanical 
and chemical pulping were developed in the mid-1800s in Germany and England. Today, at least 95% 
of paper is made from wood pulp. Before then, paper was made from rags, most commonly hemp rag. 
Using hemp directly for paper was considered too expensive, and in any event, the demand for paper 
was far more limited than today. In 1769, an early North American newspaper, the Boston Newsletter, 
encouraged people to recycle their rags for the manufacture of paper with this poem:
Rags are as beauties, which concealed lie,
But when in paper how it charms the eye,
Pray save your rags, new beauties to discover,
For paper, truly, everyone’s a lover.
By the pen and the press such knowledge is displayed,
As wouldn’t exist if paper was not made.

“Specialty pulp” is the most important component of the hemp industry of the EU (Karus and 
Vogt 2004) and is expected to remain important. In France, a large market for high-quality paper, 
predominantly cigarette paper (Figure 7.28, right), has developed; such paper is completely free of 
the intoxicating resin, so there is no possibility of inhaling cannabinoids. Other specialty pulp prod-
ucts made from hemp are bank notes, technical filters, hygiene products, bible paper, art papers, 
and tea bags. Several of these applications take advantage of hemp’s high tear and wet strength. In 
Europe, decortication/refining machines are available that can produce 10 tons/hour of hemp fiber 
suitable for such pulp use. Capacity for hemp pulp production and value-added processing is limited 
outside of Europe. Although specialty pulp has a large market in the EU, Carus et al. (2013) caution 
that no economic expansion is expected and the market is risky because wood pulp with specific 
additives could be substituted.
Hemp paper is useful for specialty applications such as currency and cigarette papers, where 
strength is needed. The bast fiber is of greatest interest to the pulp and paper industry because of 
its superior strength properties compared to wood. Hemp core fibers are generally considered too 
short for high-grade paper applications (a length of 3 mm is considered ideal), and too much lignin 
is present. While the long bast fibers have been used to make paper almost for two millennia, the 
woody core fibers have rarely been so used. However, the short, bulky fibers found in the inner part 
of the plant (hurds) could probably be used to make cheaper grades of paper, provided that appropri-
ate technology was developed (De Groot et al. 1998).
The pulp and paper industry based on wood has examined the possible wider use of hemp for 
pulp, but only on an experimental basis. The long phloem fibers of hemp do have technical prop-
erties that make them desirable for strengthening paper (Correia et al. 2003). The possibility of 
growing hemp specifically for a resurrected hemp-based paper industry has been examined (De 
Meijer 1993; Capelle 1996), and there have been attempts to clarify the genetics of characteristics 
that would improve the use of hemp for paper (Hennink 1994). Hemp’s long fibers could make paper 
more recyclable. Since virgin pulp is required for added strength in the recycling of paper, hemp 
pulp would allow for at least twice as many cycles as wood pulp. However, various analyses have 
concluded that the use of hemp for conventional paper pulp is not profitable (Lewis et al. 1948; 
Fertig 1996; Selkirk and Spencer 1999; Lisson and Mendham 2000a). Hemp is not competitive for 
newsprint, books, writing papers, and general paper (grocery bags, coffee cups, napkins), although 
there is a specialty or novelty market for those specifically wishing to support the hemp industry by 
purchasing hemp writing or printing paper despite the premium price (Figure 7.28, left). In Europe, 
hemp pulp is about five times as expensive as wood pulp (Carus et al. 2013).
Hemp paper is high-priced for several reasons. Economies of scale are such that the supply of 
hemp is minute compared to the supply of wood fiber. Hemp processing requires non-wood-based 
processing facilities. Hemp paper is typically made only from bast fibers, which require separation 
from the hurds, thereby increasing costs. This represents less than 50% of the possible fiber yield 
of the plant, and future technologies that pulp the whole stalks could decrease costs substantially.

Hemp is harvested once a year, so that it needs to be stored to feed mills throughout the year. Hemp 
stalks are very bulky, requiring much handling and storage.
Transportation costs are also very much higher for hemp stalks than for wood chips. Waste straw 
is widely available from cereals and other crops and, although generally not nearly as desirable as 
hemp, can produce bulk pulp far more cheaply than can be made from hemp. In addition to agri-
cultural wastes, there are vast quantities of scrub trees that can supply large amounts of low-quality 
wood fiber extremely cheaply. Moreover, in many areas unsuitable for agriculture, fast-growing 
trees can be grown, and such agro-forestry can be very productive and environmentally benign. 
And, directly or indirectly, the lumber/paper industry is politically powerful, able to stimulate sub-
stantial subsidies and/or supports, which is most unlikely for hemp.
A chief argument that has been advanced in favor of developing hemp as a paper and pulp source 
has been that as a nonwood or tree-free fiber source, it can reduce harvesting of primary forests and 
the threat to associated biodiversity. It has been claimed that hemp produces three to four times as 
much useable fiber per hectare per annum as forests. However, Wong (1998) notes evidence that in 
the southern United States, hemp would produce only twice as much pulp as does a pine plantation. 
It remains true, however, that hemp and other annual bast crops can be a potential lumber substitute

The classic fable of the Three Little Pigs is based on houses that they built, respectively, of straw, 
sticks, and bricks. A big bad wolf was able to blow down the houses made of straw and sticks but not 
the brick house. While the fairy tale is intended to instruct young children about the value of hard 
work to produce worthwhile creations, it does not do justice to the construction value of “wood” and 
“concrete” manufactured from hemp straw (Figure 7.29). As discussed next, hemp straw is invalu-
able for producing excellent construction materials for buildings.

Fiber
Construction Wood Products (Pressboard, Moldings)
In North America, particleboards and fiberboards, which generally contain less than 10% adhesive 
or matrix, are sometimes referred to as composites. Wood is the principal material used in sheet 
composite board (particleboard, pressboard, and oriented strand board such as Aspenite or Sterling 
board), but nonwood fibers are also employed. Flax, jute, kenaf, hemp, and wheat straw are used for 
this purpose. Wheat straw is the dominant nonwood fiber in such applications. Although it might 
seem that long hemp phloem fibers are desirable in composite wood products because of their length 
and strength, in fact, the short fibers of the hurds have been found to produce a superior product of 
appreciable strength (Nikvash et al. 2010; Figure 7.30). However, hemp fiberboard is more expen-
sive than wood particleboard and so is questionably competitive. Hautala et al. (2004) fabricated 
a plywood-like composite from hemp fiber strips and epoxy resin, and this equalled plywood in 
strength, but once again, plywood made with wood is cheaper. In China and the EU, small amounts 
of particleboard based on hemp hurds are marketed.
Concretized and Masonry Construction Products (Stucco, Building Blocks, Tiles)
Utilizing the ancient technique of strengthening clay with straw to produce reinforced bricks for 
constructing domiciles, plant fibers have found a number of comparable uses in modern times. 
Today, polypropylene or glass fiber is often employed to reinforce cement and plaster. Similarly, 
hemp fibers added to concrete increase tensile strength while reducing shrinkage and cracking. 
Fiber-reinforced cement boards and fiber-reinforced plaster are other occasionally produced experi-
mental products. Whole houses have been made based on hemp fiber. Hemp bast fibers are produced 
at much more cost than wood chips and straw from many other crops, so the use of cheaper hemp 
hurds is appropriate.
The uses noted in the previous paragraph are based on hemp simply as a mechanical strengthener 
dispersed within a matrix of a material. Much more significantly, hemp can be chemically combined 
with materials. For example, hemp with gypsum and binding agents may produce light panels that 
might compete with drywall. Hemp and lime mixtures make a high-quality plaster. Hemp hurds 
are rich in silica (which occurs naturally in sand and flint), and the hurds mixed with lime undergo 
mineralization (“petrification”) to produce a stone-like material. Using the bast fibers in addition 
to the hurds does not seem to increase the strength of hemp–lime concrete, which in any event is 
relatively weak; hemp–lime formulations typically have about 5% of the compressive strength of 
residential grade concrete and requires load-bearing supplements (De Bruijn et al. 2009); however, 
mechanical properties increase with the mortar density (Elfordy et al. 2008) and hemp–concrete 
blocks can be self-supporting. Hemp–lime concrete weighs only about 15% as much as concrete

(it can float on water), is easier to handle, lacks the brittleness of concrete, and does not need expan-
sion joints. Table 7.1 indicates some advantages of hemp–lime technology in comparison with con-
ventional construction of buildings. A big advantage is that producing hemp–lime concrete requires 
about half the energy needed for equivalent quantities of cement and masonry (Balatinecz and Sain 
2007). Hundreds of houses have been built in Europe, Asia, and North America using hemp–lime 
construction (note Figure 7.31). Several guides to building with hemp have been published (Bevan 
and Woolley 2008; Benhaim et al. 2011; Allin 2012; Stanwix and Sparrow 2014). Hemp–lime con-
struction has economic and environmental benefits (Bevan and Woolley 2008; Ip and Miller 2012; 
Duffy et al. 2013). The mineralized material can be blown or poured into the cavities of walls and 
in attics as insulation. The foundations, walls, floors, and ceilings of houses have been made using 
hemp hurds mixed with natural lime and water. Sometimes, plaster of Paris (pure gypsum), cement, 
or sand is added. The resulting material can be poured like concrete but has a texture vaguely remi-
niscent of cork—much lighter than cement and with better heat and sound-insulating properties. 
Hemp–lime stucco can be sprayed onto surfaces (Figure 7.32). Experimental ceramic tiles made of 
hemp have also been produced (Figure 7.33), which are noticeably warmer to the touch than con-
ventional tiles and so are ideal for bare feet on bathroom floors.

AnimAl beddinG bAsed on Hurds
The woody core (i.e., the hurds or shives) of hemp is highly absorbent and spongy and so makes 
remarkably good animal bedding, and indeed, such usage traces back more than a century (Dewey 
1916; Dewey and Merrill 1916). The hurds appear to be unsurpassed for horse bedding and also 
make an excellent litter for cats and other pets (Figure 7.34). It has been claimed that the Queen 
of England’s pampered horses sleep on hemp. The hurds can absorb up to five times their weight 
in moisture (typically 50% higher than wood shavings), do not produce dust (following initial dust 
removal), and are easily composted. Hemp bedding is especially suited to horses allergic to straw. In 
Europe, the animal bedding market accounts for about half of all sales of hurds (Carus et al. 2013). 
Because hemp hurds are a costly product, and animal bedding is in very high demand, this will likely 
remain the most important application of the hurds. The high absorbency of hemp hurds has led to 
their occasional use as an absorbent for oil and waste spill cleanup. Hemp as an industrial absorbent 
has generated some interest in Alberta, for use in land reclamation in the oil and gas industry.

Fiber
plAstic biocomposites
With respect to fiber, a “composite” is often defined as a material consisting of 30%–70% fiber and 
70%–30% matrix (Bolton 1995). After sisal, hemp is the most widely used natural fiber to reinforce 
composites (Shahzad 2012). This paragraph addresses plastic-type composites (“fiber-reinforced 
plastic” or “fiber-reinforced polymers”). Fibers are introduced into plastics to improve physical 
properties such as stiffness, impact resistance, and bending and tensile strength. Manmade fibers 
of glass, Kevlar, and carbon are most commonly used today, but plant fibers offer considerable cost 
savings along with comparable strength properties. “Natural fiber polymer composites” contain 
much more polymer (“plastic”) than traditional wood-based fiberboard do, often 50%, and although 
more expensive, they are also more versatile (Balatinecz and Sain 2007). Although hemp composite 
plastics are considered to be innovative today, in fact, until the 1930s, hemp-based cellophane, cel-
luloids, and other products were common.
There is a substantial market for hemp fiber plastic composites in the EU, where automobiles 
account for about 15% of the hemp fiber produced (Carus et al. 2013). The market for hemp fiber 
in North America is small, but much of the limited crop is used for plastics in automobiles. Natural 
fibers in automobile composites are used primarily in press-molded parts (“compression molding” is 
accomplished by applying pressure and usually heat to material in a confined cavity). There are two 
widespread technologies. In thermoplastic production, natural fibers are blended with fibers of mate-
rial like polypropylene and polyethylene. Most commonly, this mixture is formed into a (nonwoven) 
mat, which is pressed under heat into the desired three-dimensional form. In thermoset production, 
the natural fibers are soaked with binders such as epoxy resin, polyester resin, or polyurethane, 
placed in the desired form, and (along with heat and pressure) allowed to harden through polymer-
ization. Thermoplastics are easier to recycle (Bourmaud and Baley 2007) and are often used where 
limited structural strength is required. A wide range of thermoset resins are under development that 
are compatible with hemp fiber, and because some of these are plant based (derived from soy, canola, 
or corn), it will likely be possible to produce hemp-based biocomposites that are made 100% from 
plants. Resin-transfer molding, a process to produce thermoset-resin-based reinforced composites of 
all shapes and sizes (Sèbe et al. 2000), is often employed for high-stress products such as furniture 
and boats. Hemp has also been used in other types of thermoplastic applications, including injection 
molding (material in a fluid state is forced under pressure into the cavity of a closed mold). Injection 
molding is particularly useful for creating a variety of hemp plastic products. Extrusion molding (in 
which heated or unheated plastic is forced through a shaping die to produce a continuous form such 
as a film, sheet, rod, or tube) is an additional possibility, but not yet common. The characteristics 
of hemp fibers have proven to be superior for production of molded composites (Lu and Korman 
2012). In European manufacturing of cars and trucks, natural fibers are used in plastic door panels, 
dashboards, instrument panels, seat backs, package trays, arm rests, sun visors, passenger rear decks, 
trunk liners, and window pillars. It has been estimated that 5–10 kg of natural fibers can be used in 
the molded portions of an average automobile (excluding upholstery). The demand for automobile 
applications of hemp is expected to increase, depending on the development of new technologies 
(Carus et al. 2013). At present, in the EU automobile biocomposite industry, hemp has about a 15% 
market share, in competition with flax, jute, kenaf, and sisal fibers (Carus et al. 2013).
American industrialist Henry Ford (1863–1947), in advance of today’s automobile manufactur-
ers, constructed a car with body components made of resin stiffened with hemp and flax fiber. The 
car was able to withstand 10 times the impact of an equivalent metal panel but never entered general 
production (Shahzad 2012). Ford’s use of hemp has been emulated by other car companies (Figure 
7.35). Rather ironically in view of today’s parallel situation, Henry Ford’s hemp innovations in the 
1920s occurred at a time of crisis for American farms, later to intensify with the depression. The 
need to produce new industrial markets for farm products led to a broad movement for scientific 
research in agriculture that came to be labeled “Farm Chemurgy” (Hale 1934) that today is embod-
ied in chemical applications of crop constituents.

Of course, all other types of transportation vehicles from bicycles to airplanes can use the hemp 
plastic technology pioneered by the automobile industry. Natural fibers have considerable advan-
tages for use in conveyance (Carus et al. 2013) because of low density and weight reduction, favor-
able mechanical, acoustical, and processing properties (including low wear on tools), no splintering 
in accidents, good energy absorption, occupational health benefits (compared to glass fibers), no 
off-gassing of toxic compounds, and price advantages.
There is also considerable potential for a variety of industries producing consumer goods to 
adopt the use of hemp-based plastics in the manner that the automobile industry has demonstrated 
is feasible. Hemp plastic products can be manufactured to meet needs for hardness, density, heat 
resistance, and biodegradability, and abilities to be ground, milled, planed, and drilled. Goods that 
have been generated to date include furniture (especially seats and the backs of chairs), molded 
basins, recreational products, dishware, jewelry, sporting goods (notably surfboards, skateboards, 
and snowboards), musical instruments, and luggage.
compressed cellulose plAstics
Most hemp plastics are composites, combining hemp fiber and synthetic thermoplastics. However, 
it is possible to manufacture plastics using only cellulose. Cellulose makes up about a third of all 
vegetable material, and indeed, this natural polymer is a principal component of most plastics. In 
the absence of resin adhesive material, mechanical pressure is important so that the material in 
100% cellulose plastic is self-binding. The cellulose content of hemp fiber is quite high (about 70%), 
making it a suitable starting material. Plastics made of pure hemp cellulose are relatively expensive 
and are currently used for high-end items (see Figure 7.36).
AGRONOMY
security requirements
Security regulations for cultivating hemp in most Western countries are usually stringent and 
represent a significant cost. Depending on jurisdiction, such requirements may involve the use of 
FIGURE 7.35 Lotus Eco Elise, body constructed of hemp plastic composite, introduced in 2008. Car photo

approved cultivars obtained from authorized sources, secure fencing and storage facilities, careful 
maintenance of records, governmental inspections, sampling to ensure material has insignificant 
levels of THC, and personnel free of recent criminal records. The legislative burden that accompa-
nies the cultivation of industrial hemp puts the crop at a unique disadvantage, and it is a tribute to its 
value that it can be profitably grown. Likely as it becomes more evident that current regulations are 
needlessly demanding, the regulatory framework will become more tolerable.
GenerAl GroWtH requirements
In most respects, domesticated forms of C. sativa have narrower physiological tolerances to stresses 
than their wild-growing counterparts do (as discussed in Chapter 3). Nevertheless, the considerable 
plasticity of wild C. sativa that allows it to survive in inhospitable environments is also evident in 
domesticated plants of the species. Cultivated forms of C. sativa can be grown over a wide range of 
agro-ecological conditions.
The physiology of fiber Cannabis has been extensively studied (see Van der Werf [1994a] and Van 
der Werf et al. [1996] for extensive analyses). Both wild and cultivated plants that grow for many 
generations in a particular location tend to evolve adaptations to their local climates, and these 
adaptations may make a given biotype quite unsuitable for a foreign location.
As detailed in Chapter 5, induction of flowering in most populations of C. sativa is controlled by 
relative length of light from day to day, and it is essential to employ planting stock that will mature 
in time for harvest according to the local light/dark regime.
The soil and climate requirements of fiber hemp have been said to be comparable to those of 
wheat (Ranalli 1998). Generally, temperate, mild, relatively cool conditions are best, and the crop 
is usually grown in areas with humid atmospheres and a rainfall exceeding 65 cm, with rainfall 
especially available in the early growing season. Given that marijuana strains are often grown in 
semitropical and/or very dry regions, and indeed that such strains have been historically occasion-
ally used for multiple purposes, including fiber and oilseed, it is clear that C. sativa has the potential 
to be grown for fiber in areas beyond its traditional production regions. The following discussion is 
based mostly on cultivars suitable for temperate areas.
root GroWtH
Bócsa and Karus (1998) summarized the growth characteristics of domesticated hemp (which are 
much like those of wild hemp, described in Chapter 3) in response to soil compaction and moisture. 
The primary root can grow down to depths of 3.0 m, and from it secondary roots can extend as 
much as 80 cm. Porous, dry soils encourage downward penetration of the primary root, while com-
pacted and/or wet soils discourage deep growth. Amaducci et al. (2008d) studied root performance 
of two hemp cultivars. They found that the highest root density occurred in the top 10 cm of soil, but

some roots penetrated as deeply as 2 m. The ratio between aboveground and belowground biomass 
was 5.46 (in contrast, Bócsa and Karus 1998 reported that the root mass of fiber hemp contributes 
a much smaller proportion: only 8%–9% of the plant’s entire biomass). Male plants have a weaker 
root systems, in parallel to their less robust shoots. According to Bócsa and Karus (1998), in contrast 
to most crops, in early growth fiber hemp shoots grow so fast that they place stronger demands for 
water and nutrients on their more slowly developing roots, explaining the considerable need for high 
levels of water and nutrient availability.
soil And fertilizAtion
Ideal soils for hemp are fertile, friable, noncompacted, medium-heavy loams, including silty loam, 
clay loam, and silty clay (Ranalli 1998). Higher clay content tends to reduce yields. However, sandy 
soils provide limited fertility and are drought-prone, and the needed fertilization and irrigation may 
make production uneconomical. Soils should be neutral to slightly alkaline, the pH between 5.8 and 
7.5 (5.8 to 7.0 is ideal according to Bócsa and Karus 1998). Abundant organic matter, particularly 
livestock manure, is particularly beneficial (however, soils high in peat are unsuitable). Although 
manure is not much used today in growing hemp, Maiden (1894) wrote that “The quantity of manure 
necessary will depend on the richness and warmth of the soil and upon the climate. In England 
10–25 tons rotten dung to the acre [22–56 tonnes/ha] is not considered too much.”
Cannabis requires a rich supply of nutrients for good growth, and fertilizer is generally needed. 
Fertilization rates have spanned wide ranges in the past, probably mostly based on intuition rather 
than determination of need and response. Ehrensing (1998) compiled the following ranges based 
on a variety of reports throughout the world (kg/ha)—nitrogen (N): 40–200; phosphate (P2O5): 
30–120; and potash (K2O): 0–200. Soil analysis prior to sowing is recommended to assist in deter-
mining rate of fertilizer application. Analysis of nutrient concentration in leaves of fiber hemp has 
been employed to assist in assessing nutrient requirements (Iványi and Izsáki 2009; Iványi 2011). 
Up to 110 kg/ha of nitrogen, up to 80 kg/ha phosphate, and up to 90 kg/ha of potash may be appro-
priate. It has been pointed out that soils that grow corn (maize) well have appropriate fertility for 
hemp, although hemp reportedly requires less fertility, needing approximately the same fertility as 
a high-yielding crop of wheat.
Most annual domesticated crops have been bred to be nitrophiles, with the capacity to utilize 
large amounts of nitrogen for productive growth (Emerich and Krishnan 2009). Modern agriculture 
in fact is, to a considerable degree, based on the creation of crops that can utilize nitrogen fertil-
izers. The “Green Revolution” of the middle of the last century greatly increased agriculture pro-
duction, especially in the developing world, by selecting new cultivars that are especially capable 
and efficient at using nitrogen fertilizers (Borlaug 2000). As discussed in Chapter 3, wild C. sativa 
is a natural nitrophile, thriving in well-manured substrates and stripping soils readily of nitrogen. 
The nitrogen requirements of fiber hemp have been extensively studied (Van der Werf et al. 1995c; 
Struik et al. 2000; Amaducci et al. 2002a; Vera et al. 2010; Prade et al. 2011). Cultivars are typically 
fertilized with nitrogen at a rate of 100 kg/ha/season (Bócsa and Karus 1998), which is higher than 
the recommended rates for some modern high-yielding field crops. Uniformity of stems is desirable 
for harvesting and processing, and excessively high levels of nitrogen fertilization (200 kg/ha) have 
been observed to increase variability of height and weight of hemp stems compared to moderate 
(80 kg/ha) nitrogen rates (Van der Werf et al. 1995c). Another undesirable consequence of too high 
nitrogen fertilization is decreased content of bark fiber (Van der Werf et al. 1995b).
Bócsa and Karus (1998) stated that fiber hemp has a substantial need for phosphorus throughout 
the season, in part to effectively utilize nitrogen, but also to contribute to the elasticity and tensile 
strength of the fiber cells and bundles.
Bócsa and Karus (1998) also pointed out that fiber hemp has a substantial need for potassium, 
especially in midseason, when the fibers are rapidly developing. Potassium fertilization of fiber 
hemp was studied by Finnan and Burke (2013), who found that frequently recommended rates are 
 

125
Fiber
between 140 and 230 kg K/ha depending on soil type and soil potassium level. However, these 
authors concluded that potassium requirements are lower than for many other crops and suggested 
that an optimal potassium fertilization strategy for soils with moderate to high levels of potassium 
(>70 mg/L) is to simply restore, after harvest, the preharvest level.
WAter relAtions
It has long been known that cultivars of C. sativa can tolerate hot, arid conditions, provided that 
the roots are adequately supplied with water (Dewey 1914). Regular rainfall, especially during the 
first six weeks after seeding, is extremely beneficial. Soils should be well drained but capable of 
providing sufficient capillarity movement of water from lower depths to the surface. Wet, flooded, 
or waterlogged soils are very poorly tolerated (young plants up to three weeks or so are very sensi-
tive to wet soils and flooding). Large-scale cultivation of hemp has generally been conducted in 
areas with sufficient rainfall that irrigation is unnecessary. Soil should be moist when the seeds 
are planted, and irrigation may be required until germination has occurred (usually within three 
days after sowing). Industrial hemp is sensitive to drought and needs ample moisture throughout 
the growing season, especially during the first six weeks of its growth, and it may be necessary to 
irrigate to keep the soil moist. European experience indicates that 50–70 cm of rainfall is needed 
during the season, although Lisson and Mendham (1998) stated that the literature suggests a range 
of 25 to 60 cm annually, depending on climate. Although well-rooted plants endure drought rela-
tively successfully, severe droughts dwarf the crop and hasten flower and seed production. Lisson 
and Mendham (1998), based on studies in Tasmania, found that water extraction by the roots was 
mostly confined to the upper 80–90 cm of the soil but occasionally went down to at least 140 cm.
In Chapters 12, 13, and 18, the indica type marijuana group is discussed (which is not suitable 
for fiber production). This is established in the arid area of Afghanistan and western Turkmenistan, 
and when strains from this region are grown in high-humidity climates, their dense flowering tops 
retain moisture and succumb to “bud mold” caused by Botrytis cinerea and Trichothecium roseum 
(McPartland et al. 2000). There are land races employed for fiber production in the same areas from 
which indica type strains originated, and these are likely also unsuitable for fiber production in 
areas of high humidity.
temperAtures
Cannabis is well suited to warm temperate regions, although it can grow in a range of temperatures. 
The species tolerates heat well but not cold. Cultivated plants grow best between 14°C and 27°C but 
tolerate both colder and warmer conditions. The warmer range promotes growth (Van der Werf et al. 
1995b). Optimal temperatures for photosynthesis (which is not necessarily reflective of best tempera-
tures for growth) vary from 25°C to 30°C, depending on variety. (Chandra et al. 2011b did not find 
evidence of differences between drug and fiber varieties.) Optimal temperature for hemp germina-
tion has been reported as 24°C, and this rather elevated temperature reflects a crop that is generally 
not planted early in the season because the seedling develops slowly at low temperatures. Seeds of 
cultivars tend not to germinate well until the ground is warm (preferably at least 10°C). However, 
the seeds will germinate at temperatures as low as 0°C and as high as 45°C, and often, fiber hemp 
has been planted as soon as the danger of a hard frost has passed. Seedlings and mature plants are 
resistant to light frosts of short duration. Seedlings can sometimes survive short exposures to −8°C to 
−10°C (Bócsa and Karus 1998), but the plant is best adapted to an extended frost-free season. Mature 
plants endure light frosts (as cold as −5°C to −6°C), but not a hard frost or long-continuing tempera-
tures around freezing. Van der Werf (1993), summarizing Russian literature on temperature toler-
ance, noted that: sowing is recommended when soil temperatures are 8°C–10°C; hemp seedlings have 
been observed to survive short frosts as low as −10°C; before flowering, hemp has been observed to 
survive frosts as low as −6°C; and a frost of −1°C at flowering decreases seed yield and seed quality.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
There is little information available on comparative cold adaptation of cultivars from different 
latitudes, but possibly those that have been grown for many years in northern locations are relatively 
tolerant. Grigoryev (1988) discussed the ecology of hemp cultivated under the short-season, cold 
conditions of central Russia, where the crop has been raised near the northern limit of agriculture 
(about 66° N latitude): from Arkhangelsk to Mezen to the Pechora River (Ust-Tsilma) to Tobolsk 
Province, Surgut (61° 17'N), and on the Kolyma River (Verhnekolymsk, at 65° N, 153° E). The 
cold tolerance of germinating seedlings of Russian varieties described by Grigoryev is noteworthy: 
some are capable of germinating at 1°C, withstanding frosts of −1°C for 2 weeks and up to −15°C 
for 24 hours without damage (much more extreme tolerance than recorded elsewhere). For many 
Russian fiber cultivars, frosts of about −7°C are tolerated, even when the soil is quite moist, but once 
the stage of flowering is reached, low extended temperature delays growth and frost can destroy the 
plant. Grigoryev suggested that hemp could be grown as a winter crop, although it is universally 
sown in the spring, not the fall.
seed GerminAtion
Germination of domesticated seeds typically takes three to seven days, and is more or less simul-
taneous, since dormancy has been selected against. However, old seed can germinate somewhat 
irregularly, and seeds planted at different depths may also tend to produce seedlings at different 
times. Hemp seeds scattered in the field during harvesting sometimes produce volunteer seedlings 
in the fall, which are killed by cold (seedlings may also be produced in the spring, and those can 
survive to maturity). This reflects the lack of dormancy in domesticated C. sativa. Janischevsky 
(1924), who extensively studied wild hemp in southern Russia, never observed fall-produced seed-
lings. Temperatures for germination were discussed earlier in this chapter. As noted in Chapter 3, 
light has been reported to be a partial inhibitor of germination. Seeds germinate readily in the dark 
(Haney and Kutscheid 1975), and commercial seed is generally planted 1–2 cm (sometimes to 4 cm) 
deep, sufficient for considerable shading, but also useful for moisture availability. After imbibition 
of water, the radicle (primary root) expands, the hypocotyl (base of the shoot) emerges, and the 
cotyledons (primary leaflets) unfold above soil level (Mediavilla et al. 1998). The initial growth of 
the radicle can be quite rapid—up to 10 cm in 48 hours.
mAintAininG seed viAbility in storAGe
For commercial hemp production, the longevity of fresh seeds decreases fairly rapidly to about 
70%–80% after two years of storage in a sheltered but otherwise uncontrolled climate, and if not 
planted at least by then, it is often recommended that they be discarded. In commercial practice, a 
minimum germination percentage of 85% to 90% has been recommended (Bócsa and Karus 1998).
There has been considerable study of the storage factors influencing the viability of seeds of 
domesticated hemp. As reviewed in the following, low temperatures (just above 0°C) and low 
humidity both prolong seed longevity. Kondo et al. (1950) found that hemp seeds stored for 19 years 
with the desiccant calcium chloride germinated, indicating the importance of controlling humidity. 
Crocioni (1950) studied seed moisture, temperature, air, and light in relation to the longevity of hemp 
seeds of the Carmagnola variety stored at Bologna, Italy, for 3.5 years. He found that seed moisture 
and temperature were the most important factors, while air (oxygen availability) and diffused light 
instead of darkness were of uncertain influence. A temperature a few degrees above 0°C and a low 
seed-moisture content, up to 8.6%, were judged best for preserving germination capacity. Seeds of 
10%–15% moisture content kept at high temperatures rapidly lost their germinating capacity. Seeds 
stored at low temperature retained satisfactory germination for 16 months, whatever the moisture 
content, and so did seeds of about 8% moisture content stored at or below 27°C. Seeds stored longer 
than 16 months retained viability better at a seed-moisture content of about 6% than did seeds with 
a higher moisture content stored at a low temperature. Toole et al. (1960) studied germination of 
 

127
Fiber
Kentucky hempseed (much of which was of Italian origin). They reported that seeds stored at 5.7% 
moisture and 21°C did not decrease in germination after six years; seeds at 9.5% moisture main-
tained full viability for 5.5 years at both 0°C and −10°C. Lemeshev et al. (1995) outlined plans for 
storage of Cannabis seeds at the Vavilov Research Institute Gene Bank in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
the largest germplasm collection of Cannabis seeds in the world. For their active collection (referred 
to as a working collection), used for short-term purposes of reproducing and distributing seed, the 
policy was to store the seeds at about 15°C and 10% moisture content. For “medium-term storage” 
(up to 10 years), collections were stored at 4°C–6°C and 7% moisture content. For long-term storage 
(10–20 years) the storage temperature was −20°C, and the moisture content was 6%.
Additional but less detailed reports on temperature and moisture requirements for conservation 
of germination capacity of hemp seeds are Laskos (1970), Demkin and Romanenko (1978), and 
Parihar et al. (2014).
Small and Brookes (2012) summarized practical aspects of hemp seed viability as follows.
• To maintain the germinability of seeds of C. sativa, they should not be stored under the 
ambient conditions usually encountered in the high-humidity areas where hemp is typi-
cally produced.
• Maintaining C. sativa seed at a moisture content of 5% to 8% is sufficient to retain substan-
tial germinabilty for at least six years. A lower moisture content does not seem to improve 
germinability over this time interval.
• Maintaining C. sativa seed at a temperature of 5°C is sufficient to retain substantial ger-
minability for at least six years. A temperature of −20°C can improve germinability, but 
not greatly.
• For commercial storage of C. sativa seed in a viable state for one to several seasons, the 
most economical investment would usually be drying the seed, at least to 8% but preferably 
to 6% moisture content and maintaining this level. Where this is difficult, seed should be 
kept refrigerated, at least at 5°C for periods of up to several years, but at lower temperatures 
for periods of the order of 10 years.
• For long-term scientific or germplasm banking of C. sativa seed in a viable state for up to 
a decade, a moisture content of 6% coupled with a storage temperature of −20°C is suf-
ficient. Whether more extreme conditions would be of benefit for a longer period has not 
been determined.
• Although the presence of oxygen hastens seed deterioration of some species, which can 
therefore profit from storage in an atmosphere such as nitrogen gas (thus excluding oxy-
gen), C. sativa seeds do not seem to benefit from such treatment.
plAntinG requirements
A well-tilled, fine, level, firm seedbed promotes uniform germination. The soil bed should be free 
of weeds and debris. Seeds are usually sown at a depth of 10 to 30 mm, the deeper figure appropri-
ate for drier soils (as noted in Van der Werf 1993, in dry seedbeds, hempseed has been planted up 
to 5 cm deep). However, shallower depths promote soil warming, and more rapid emergence and 
establishment. Soils with a large clay content are inappropriate, but if nevertheless used, shallower 
planting may be desirable if rain is expected that could crust the upper layer, making seedling 
emergence more difficult. Larger seeds can probably withstand deeper depths better that small 
seeds. Use of a roller at sowing may assist germination by facilitating good contact between seed 
and soil. Seeds are normally sown in rows spaced from 7 to 20 cm apart, using seed drills. The 
optimal rate of sowing at any one location depends on variety and local environmental conditions. 
Fiber strains are typically sown at a minimum rate of 250 seeds/m2 (approximately 45 kg/ha), 
and up to three times that density is sometimes recommended. For fiber production, sowing rates 
vary from 40 to 150 kg seed/ha; in Western Europe, seeding rates are generally 50 to 70 kg/ ha. 
 

128
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The planting rate should be higher if germination is low (although seed less than 85% viable should 
be discarded) or on poor soils (which should be avoided), and large seeds may require a heavier 
planting rate (see Table 7.2). In any event, seed density recommendations from the supplier should 
be followed.
Extensive studies have been conducted on the effects of planting density. The seeding rate 
strongly influences the yield and quality of fiber produced by the crop. Van der Werf et al. (1995a) 
found that the proportion of stem in the total dry matter increases with increasing plant density, 
which is desirable. Another desirable result of higher density is that stands produce thinner stems 
with a higher percentage of bast fiber and less woody core, i.e., a higher bark-to-core ratio (Van 
der Werf 1991). Moreover, the fineness of the bast fiber increases at higher densities, which con-
tributes to fiber quality for spinning purposes (Jakobey 1965). However, excessively high densities 
waste seeds (Amaducci et al. 2002b) and can be counterproductive. Fiber plantations typically have 
 200–250 plants/m2, but plant densities between 80 and 400 plants per square meter have been found 
to have little effect on either total biomass or stem dry matter yield, and excessive seeding rates result 
in self-thinning, i.e., high mortality of smaller plants (Van der Werf et al. 1995a,c). Mechanical 
harvest ing and industrial processing of fiber hemp usually benefit from uniform size and diameter 
of stems, and high densities can increase the variability of stem sizes, which is undesirable (Van der 
Werf and van den Berg 1995).
In Europe, dual-purpose crops of hemp, grown for both fiber and oilseed, are planted at row 
spacings from 20 to 40 cm, 20 seeds/m within the row, considered sufficient to suppress weeds. 
Higher plant densities are more effective at weed suppression (Hall et al. 2014; Jankauskienė et al. 
2014), but planting density is designed mainly to maximize yield, not minimize weeds.
rotAtions
Hemp has been and continues to be grown sometimes on the same land for several years in suc-
cession. However, most agricultural species benefit by alternating with several different crops in 
sequence over a period of years (usually three to five), and the same is true for C. sativa. Rotation 
tends to promote soil fertility and reduce diseases. Often, some crops complement each other in 
rotations, and frequently a particular sequence is best. Hemp is typically rotated with cereals and 
major vegetables. It particularly benefits from following a nitrogen-enriching legume crop, espe-
cially alfalfa or clover (soybean is less beneficial).

Fiber
Wind, rAin, And HAil dAmAGe
Wind, rain, and hail can damage tall crops, especially if their stems are weak. The very tall, slim 
stems of fiber hemp are subject to lodging from wind, but are grown at such high densities that sur-
rounding plants provide support, usually preventing significant damage. Advanced oilseed cultivars 
are usually relatively short (so less subject to wind damage) and grown at lower densities (so more 
susceptible to wind), but lodging is usually not a problem, and in any event, plants that are bent over 
can often still be productive. Heavy rain and hail can damage foliage of fiber cultivars, but rarely 
the stems.
pests
All plants are susceptible to a wide range of “herbivores” or “pests” (collectively including ani-
mals, microorganism pathogens, and weeds), and crops grown as monocultures are usually sub-
ject to extensive damage from certain species. For several major crops, losses due to pests can 
exceed 50% (Oerke 2006). Cannabis sativa is attacked by a wide diversity of insects and diseases. 
McPartland (1997a,b, 1998b) and McPartland et al. (2000) provide authoritative reviews of hemp 
diseases and pests, and the most significant problems are mentioned here. McPartland (1998a) 
pointed out that the frequent claim that hemp is “pest-free” is inaccurate; rather, hemp is “pest-
tolerant.” As a crop, C. sativa is remarkably resistant to many pests. Indeed, Kok et al. (1994) 
demonstrated that fiber hemp suppresses three major soil pathogens: the fungus Verticillium 
dahlia and the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne hapla and M.  chitwoodi. Significant weed, 
insect, and disease problems are rare for fiber hemp, and it is generally grown without the use 
of postplanted (after-seeding) herbicides, insecticides, and above-ground fungicides. There are 
a few problems with pest mammals and birds, which as discussed later, can be serious predators 
of the seeds.
Susceptibility of C. sativa to pests and diseases differs according to circumstances of cultiva-
tion. For example, fiber crops are grown in very dense plantations and the raised humidity around 
the stalks increases infections of fungal diseases; as well, the dense canopy is protective of many 
insects. By contrast, both drug and oilseed crops are grown in open rows, and the increased sunlight 
is attractive to flea beetles and birds. Presumably, susceptibility of wild populations also changes 
with plant density. Susceptibility also differs according to genetic background of the plant, for 
example, between fiber and drug cultivars.
Weeds
Weed management prior to planting is required as hemp does not establish well in competition with 
other plants. Planting hemp too early, when weeds can outcompete it under cold conditions, is unde-
sirable. Similarly, an unexpected cold spell can give weeds the opportunity to establish in a hemp 
stand. For fiber hemp, which is always densely grown, the developing canopy closes in five to seven 
weeks, eliminating the need for subsequent weed elimination.
Higher Plant Parasites
Two vascular plant parasitic genera occur on Cannabis: broomrape (Orobanche) on the roots and 
dodder (Cuscuta) on the stalks and branches. Branched broomrape (O. ramosa L., also known as 
hemp broomrape) is the most significant vascular plant parasite of hemp, while O. aegypticaca 
Persoon and O. cernua Loefling have also been recorded on hemp (McPartland et al. 2000). 
Broomrape is a formidable pest in Europe. It spends most of its life cycle hidden underground, and 
each plant can produce up to 500,000 dust-like seeds that are sticky and adhere well to the seeds of 
C. sativa (McPartland et al. 2000). The Canadian Seed Growers Association regulations concerning 
hemp state that the presence of broomrape in industrial hemp crops is cause for refusing pedigreed 
status and forbid the cultivation of pedigreed hemp seed on land that has grown tobacco during the 
 

130
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
last three years (tobacco is an alternate host of broomrape). Several species of dodder have also been 
found on hemp, with Cuscuta campestris most frequently recorded on cultivated and wild C. sativa 
in North America (McPartland et al. 2000).
Mammalian Pests
Domesticated mammalian grazers, especially cattle, horses, and goats, have been observed to nibble 
small amounts of cultivated hemp, but they do not cause significant damage (McPartland et al. 2000). 
Wild mammals, including deer, rabbits, raccoons, rats, field voles, mice, and groundhogs (wood-
chucks) have caused significant feeding damage to hemp (McPartland et al. 2000). Woodchucks espe-
cially are capable of causing great destruction to young plantations of hemp (McPartland et al. 2000).
Birds
Walter (1938) recorded that members of the crow family, such as magpies and jackdaws, are par-
ticularly attracted to hemp in Europe. The extinct passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) was 
once a major pest of Kentucky hempseed fields (Allen 1980). Haney and Bazzaz (1970) noted that 
mourning doves (Zenaidura macroura) frequented hemp in Illinois and in southwestern Iowa, and 
hemp was found to be the most important food of mourning doves in Iowa by McClure (1943). 
Mourning doves are also very frequent visitors to hemp fields in southern Ontario. Bobwhite quail 
(Colinus virginianus) and ringtail pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) have also been observed to feed 
heavily on hemp seeds in the American Midwest (Robel 1969; McPartland et al. 2000). Hemp 
seeds improperly prepared without removal of the resin-rich perigonal bract can make birds giddy 
(Matsunaga et al. 1998).
Insects
Nearly 300 insect species have been found to attack Cannabis, but few cause significant dam-
age (McPartland 1996b, 1998a). Stems are the organs of value in fiber hemp, and stem borers are 
troublesome. The most damaging are the caterpillars of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubi-
lalis; see Chapter 6) and hemp borers (Grapholita dilineana and G. tristrigana), which eat much 
of the plant including the seeds. The corn borer is a specialist of Cannabis and the closely related 
genus, Humulus, and turned to corn only after maize was introduced to Europe (McPartland 1998a). 
Beetle larvae, particularly of the hemp flea beetle (Psylliodes attenuata), eat roots while the adults 
eat leaves and inflorescences. Adult weevils and curculios chew into leaves while the grubs feed 
on the pith of stems and roots. The worst is the cabbage or hemp curculio, Ceutorhynchus rapae. 
Flower beetle grubs (Mordellistena micans, M. parvula) feed on various parts of hemp, and grubs 
of a variety of scarab beetles (e.g., the European chafer, Melolontha hippocastani) are also a prob-
lem. Numerous other damaging species occur in North Temperate regions, and still more species 
are important in semitropical countries. European cultivars grown in nonnative environments have 
been observed to be attacked by a wide range of pests and diseases for which they have no resis-
tance (Watson and Clarke 1997). Lago and Stanford (1989) catalogued phytophagous insects on a 
large plantation of high-THC Cannabis in Mississippi. McPartland (1998b) discusses insects to be 
expected on cultivated hemp in Canada.
Other Invertebrates
Other animals that are significant herbivores of hemp include nematodes and slugs. Of these, nema-
todes are capable of the greatest damage. Only about a half dozen nematodes have been recorded as 
causing significant damage on hemp, and for the most part, the greatest damage has been recorded 
in hot climates (McPartland et al. 2000).
Fungi
Fungi are responsible for most diseases of Cannabis, and the long stalks of fiber cultivars are espe-
cially susceptible to stalk-canker fungi (McPartland 1996a, 1998b; McPartland and Cubeta 1997). 
 

131
Fiber
McPartland (1998a) recorded 88 species of fungi (represented in the literature by over 400 names) and 
concluded that only a few cause economic losses. Of these, the worst is gray mold, Botrytis cinerea, 
which thrives in cool, humid conditions and can cause considerable damage in wet years (Van der 
Werf et al. 1996). Hemp canker (of the stem) is commonly due to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and is usu-
ally viewed as the second most important disease of hemp (Fusarium species and many other genera 
also cause stem cankers). Root rot of C. sativa is often due to Fusarium solani. Wilts are caused by 
Fusarium and Verticillium, and blights, leaf spot, and mildews of Cannabis are due to several fungi. 
Damping off of seedlings is also caused by a variety of fungi, but most by the oömycetes (not true 
fungi) of the genus Pythium. Seeds are sometimes treated with fungicides to reduce soil diseases.
Bacteria
Four bacteria are significant pathogens of C. sativa (McPartland et al. 2000), with one of these split 
into four “pathovarieties” (designated by pv.): Pseudomonas syringae pv. cannabina (causes bacte-
rial leaf spot and bacterial blight), P. syringae pv. mori (causes “striatura ulcerosa”), P.  syringae 
pv. tabaci (causes wildfire), P. syringae pv. mellea (causes Wisconsin leaf spot), Xanthomonas 
 campestris pv. cannabis (cause xanthomonas blight), Erwinia tracheiphila (causes bacterial wilt), 
and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (causes crown gall).
Phytoplasma (mycoplasma-like organisms or MLOs) are specialized bacterial parasites of plant 
phloem tissues and transmitting insects (vectors), and a species of this has been found in C. sativa 
(Phatak et al. 1975).
Viruses
Five viruses regularly infect European cultivated C. sativa (McPartland et al. 2000): hemp streak virus 
(HSV), alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), 
and hemp mosaic virus (HMV). Aphids are the most important transmitters of viruses in C. sativa 
(McPartland et al. 2000).
HArvest
For a fiber crop, extensive experience has indicated that hemp is best cut in the early flowering stage 
or while pollen is being shed, well before seeds are set. However, later harvesting, when pollination 
is finished and the first seeds begin to ripen, has been practiced in some areas. Mediavilla al. (2001) 
documented that fiber yield reaches a maximum at the time of flowering of the male plants. Keller et 
al. (2001) experimentally demonstrated that a harvest time at the beginning of seed maturity facili-
tates bast fiber extraction without reducing tensile strength, while harvesting after the flowering of 
the male plants results in reductions of fiber quantity and quality. Rather ignorantly, until 2001, EU 
regulations specified that, for purposes of subsidization, the crop could not be cut until the seed 
was 50% mature in form and size. The authoritative guide by Bócsa and Karus (1998) recommends 
harvesting at full flowering of male plants and at first appearance of flowers for female plants, as 
subsequent lignification reduces fiber quality. General advice regarding the best time to harvest 
monoecious fiber varieties has been contradictory, and it is advisable to follow the recommenda-
tions accompanying particular cultivars.
Putting tall whole plants through a conventional combine results in the straw winding around 
moving parts and the fibers working into bearings, causing breakdown, fires, high maintenance, 
and frustration. Especially on small acreages, crops are harvested with sickle-bar mowers and hay 
swathers, but plugging of equipment is a constant problem. Slower operation of conventional com-
bines has been recommended (0.6–2 ha/hour). Large crops are ideally harvested with specialized 
equipment (e.g., Figure 7.37).
Hemp has often been grown as a dual-purpose crop, i.e., for both fiber and oilseed. In France, the 
principal grower of dual-purpose varieties, the grain is taken off the field first with a combine, the 
cutting blade raised to leave most of the stalks for later harvest, and the seeds threshed.
 

132
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Growing hemp to the stage that mature seeds are present compromises the quality of the fiber, 
because of lignification. As well, the hurds become more difficult to separate. The lower-quality 
fiber, however, is quite utilizable for pulp and nonwoven usages. In the EU, hurds are usually not 
completely separated from the phloem fiber (2% to 25% hurds are retained in the so-called “total 
fiber line,” depending on the application).
yields
Reports of fiber yields in the literature often do not make clear whether the information is based 
on wet or dry weight (only the latter is appropriate), whether based on entire plant or stalk only, or 
whether the report deals with primary phloem (line, long) fiber and tow secondary phloem (short) 
fiber collectively or just the line fiber. About two-thirds of the weight of a dried plant (stalk + foli-
age) is stalk. About one-fifth of dry, retted, defoliated stems is made up of phloem fiber (primary + 
secondary collectively). In Europe, dry matter yields have ranged from 5800 to 19,500 kg/ha, and 
dry stem yields from 5000 to 13,700 kg/ha. In North America, dry stem yields have varied between 
2500 and 28,000 kg/ha (all of the preceding statistics based on Fortenbery and Bennett 2004). 
Struik et al. (2000) reported that hemp potentially can yield 25,000 kg/ha above-ground dry matter, 
20,000 kg/ha stem dry matter, and 12,000 kg/ha cellulose. Salentijn et al. (2015) noted that yield of 
dry bast fiber varies from 1200 to 3000 kg/ha. Cellulose yield is usually 7000–10,000 kg/ha (Zatta 
et al. 2012). In modern European cultivars, at harvest time (when most of the lower foliage has been 
dropped), the stems make up about 85% of the above-ground dry weight of the plant (Van der Werf 
et al. 1998). Figure 7.38 illustrates a typical breakdown of the composition of weight of a hectare of 
fiber hemp based on a fresh (green) weight of 40,000 kg and a dry stem weight yield of 10,500 kg. 
The hurds constitute about 70% of the stalk dry matter (Dang and Nguyen 2006), but generally, the 
hurd yield can be two to three times as much as the yield of bast fiber (five times as much, according 
to Dewey 1916).

storAGe
Harvested, dried, retted stalks are appropriately baled when dried to less than 15% moisture, and 
drying should continue during indoor storage until moisture content is about 10%. In the Old World, 
retted stalks have often been stored outdoors. However, moisture can be wicked up from bare ground 
(possibly even from gravel floors), affecting quality. Buyers generally demand bales of given sizes 
and may require avoiding polyester and plastic twines since these will contaminate manufactured 
products.
BREEDING
“Breeding” as a term may simply mean sexual reproduction, but here it refers to creating (usually by 
selection) new variations of a plant that increase its usefulness for humans. Plant breeding is carried 
out by several techniques, outlined in the following. Modern plant breeding in Europe has produced 
several dozen hemp fiber strains, although by comparison with other fiber crops, there are relatively 
few described varieties of hemp. Since World War II in Europe, breeding has been concerned most 
particularly with the development of monoecious varieties. Breeding for fiber qualities of C. sativa 
has been reviewed by Salentijn et al. (2015).
“Mass selection” is probably the oldest and most widely practiced method of selection for out-
breeding crops like C. sativa. The seeds of what appear to be relatively desirable plants are used to 
propagate the next season’s crop, with the result that over several years, the characteristics judged 
to have merit tend to become uniform. Landraces have evolved in this manner. The process tends

to be slow. Because such selection tends to maintain the status quo, it is employed to maintain the 
purity of registered cultivars.
“Individual selection” concentrates on evaluating the progeny from elite plants (those that 
appear to be champions with respect to desired traits). Once the superior progeny have been iden-
tified, they can be used as breeding stock (involving controlled pollination) to generate a supply 
of plants with superior traits. Because most of the characteristics of value in C. sativa can only 
be evaluated after flowering has occurred, careful records need to be kept so that the breeder 
will know which seeds to keep and which to discard. However, the German fiber hemp breeder 
G. Bredeman pioneered a technique (“Bredeman’s method”) that allowed breeders to evaluate the 
fiber merits of (at least male) plants before they flowered, so they could be used directly to gener-
ate improved strains. He cleverly slit the vertical stems of male plants, removing half the stem 
for fiber analysis, and allowing the other half (supported by a stake) to develop pollen. Only the 
male plants with the highest fiber content are permitted to pollinate the female plants. The seed 
from all the females are harvested, but only seed from the females with the highest fiber are used 
for additional breeding. Using this methodology, great gains in the productivity of fiber hemp 
resulted in Europe.
“Marker-assisted selection” is based on selecting a “marker” that is linked to a trait that a breeder 
wishes to select. The markers may be morphological or chemical (especially protein) but are com-
monly DNA tags identifying particular locations in the genome. This indirect selection process can 
dramatically improve the efficiency of selecting plants with desirable gene combinations. Markers 
can be employed to transfer single genes or to follow the inheritance of many genes. Marker-assisted 
selection is considered to have excellent potential for C. sativa (Mandolino et al. 1996; Mandolino 
and Ranalli 1998; Mandolino and Ranalli 2002; Mandolino and Carboni 2004). Genetic markers in 
C. sativa have been found for femaleness (Shao et al. 2003) and maleness (Mandolino et al. 1999, 
2002; Törjék et al. 2002; see Chapter 4).
Hybridization followed by selection has long been the major tool of plant breeding to increase 
yield, vigor, and uniformity. So-called combination or pedigree breeding emphasizes the creation of 
cultivars by transfer of single genes or gene combinations, achieved by hybridization, backcrossing, 
and selection.
“Heterosis breeding” is a combination of hybridization and selection that takes advantage of 
particularly desirable genetic partners. Hybridizing distantly related organisms tends to produce 
heterosis (hybrid vigor, sometimes related to preventing harmful recessive genes [alleles] from 
combining), the opposite of inbreeding depression (often related to harmful recessive genes being 
combined from both parents). In heterosis, an F1 hybrid tends to have an increase in some desirable 
characteristics (such as height, productivity, or disease resistance) compared to the mean of the same 
traits of its parents. Most European cultivars appear to share so much of a common genetic heritage 
that when they are mated heterosis does not develop, but when hybridized to East Asian cultivars, 
the hybrids do exhibit hybrid vigor (De Meijer 1998). Lyster H. Dewey of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (see his publications in the Literature Cited), who has been referred to as “the first hemp 
breeder” (Bócsa 1998), hybridized European and Chinese landraces to produce vigorous cultivars 
in the early twentieth century.
“Hybrid cultivars” are not merely cultivars that are the result of past hybridization between dif-
ferent biotypes (probably all cultivars of C. sativa hold this status); as explained in the following, 
they are the result of a specific marriage of parental strains or cultivars and must be generated anew 
each season. They are reminiscent of mules, the progeny of horses and donkeys, renowned for their 
endurance that exceeds that of their parents but themselves virtually unable to produce offspring. In 
modern crop hybrid cultivar breeding, the parents can be deliberately inbred, so that when they are 
mated, their genetic interaction in the F1 hybrid is especially desirable. Compatible combinations 
generally need to be determined by trial and error. Dewey (1927) may have created the first docu-
mented intervarietal hybrid cultivars. When the plants within an F1 hybrid population are allowed 
to interbreed, genes determining their superior characteristics segregate and recombine and are so 
 

135
Fiber
variable that they are of limited advantage to farmers. Accordingly, farmers must purchase certified 
hybrid seed every growing season from the breeder, who produces the seed by repeatedly crossing 
a given set of parents. Actually, “pseudohybrid” cultivars, many of them produced in France, are F2 
hybrid populations.
Several popular hybrid cultivars are mostly monoecious. These are produced by crossing female 
dioecious hemp (males are rogued out of the field) pollinated by monoecious hemp.
Cultivars of many crops today are transgenic, the result of DNA recombination. In transgenic 
plants (more generally, genetically modified organisms), a desired “transgene” (coding for a useful 
trait) has been identified, isolated, cloned, and inserted. Feeney and Punja (2003) demonstrated the 
feasibility of transgenic hemp by transferring a gene encoding the enzyme phosphomannose isom-
erase into hemp.
Mutation breeding is based on exposing seeds to chemicals or radiation to generate mutants with 
desirable traits. If a mutated plant is produced, it can be hybridized with normal plants to transfer 
the altered gene. Tens of thousands of cultivars of various plants have been created. The technique 
does not seem to have been used to generate any commercial variety of C. sativa.
Doubling the number of chromosomes of a crop plant has sometimes been found to make it 
more productive. Cannabis sativa normally has a somatic (diploid) number of 20 chromosomes 
(expressed as 2n = 20) (Small 1972a). Doubling of chromosome number is most frequently achieved 
by exposing meristems (growing points) to a mitotic toxin. (Mitosis is the normal way that cells 
divide in two, each new cell receiving a full complement of chromosomes. The toxin, usually col-
chicine, prevents normal division, so that the new cell receives all of the new chromosomes that 
normally would have been divided between two cells.) Tetraploid selections of C. sativa (i.e., with 
2n = 40) have been generated frequently (e.g., Warmke and Blakeslee 1939; Zhatov et al. 1969; 
Sidorenko 1978). They proved to be fertile, with larger seeds and seed yields, but since their fibers 
were coarse and not as useful, they were abandoned (Bócsa 1998; Ranalli 2004).
CULTIVARS
Several dozen European fiber hemp cultivars make up the bulk of modern registered Cannabis cul-
tivars (see Chapter 17). Most of these originate from European land races (De Meijer 1995a, 1995b, 
1998). These were selected mostly for the temperate regions of Europe, and their photoperiod adap-
tations are often unsuitable for more northern or southern regions. European cultivars appear to 
represent a relatively limited range of genetic variation.
ECONOMIC STATUS
More than 30 countries produce hemp crops. China, Canada, and France (in decreasing order) are 
the leading producers. Although China has virtually always been the largest producer, and hemp 
can be grown in most places in the country, the crop has nevertheless been minor in Chinese agri-
culture (Wang and Shi 1999). In Europe, the main producers are France, the United Kingdom, and 
the Netherlands. Recently, cultivation in Germany has decreased greatly. Italy had an outstanding 
reputation for high-quality hemp, but productivity has waned for the last several decades. Minor 
production of hemp for fiber still occurs in Austria, Russia, the Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, the 
countries of the former Yugoslavia, Romania, North Korea, Chile, and Peru. There has been recent 
interest in Australia and South Africa in cultivating hemp.
Figure 7.39 shows twenty-first century global hemp yield by year, categorized by seed and fiber 
production. These data are based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics and are 
known to be incomplete (some countries have not reported information, and the reliability of some 
data is undetermined). FAO data for fiber production show a steady decline in worldwide production 
of hemp from 1966 to 1990, with subsequent stabilization at a relatively low level compared to the 
past (Figure 7.40).

Figure 7.41 reports acreage by year for the last two decades, for Canada, China, and the EU, the 
three largest areas of production (statistics for the latter part of the twentieth century are provided 
by Sponner et al. 2005). (The reliability of the Chinese data is undetermined. Since China is report-
edly the world’s largest producer, the acreage shown in Figure 7.41 seems low.) Note that China and 
Europe have traditionally grown hemp primarily for fiber, whereas Canada grows hemp primarily 
for oilseed. “The increasing demand for fibers, seeds and cannabinoids in the medical field in recent 
years has led to a new record acreage of 22,000 ha cultivation area in 2015” (Michael Karus, regard-
ing EU acreage, in Nova Institute Newsletter, June 2015).
As noted earlier, hemp constitutes only about 0.3% of the world’s natural fiber production, 
excluding wood fiber. As shown in Table 7.3, the world value of hemp fiber is about 6% that of flax 
(the most comparable bast fiber), and about 0.05% that of cotton, the leading natural annual fiber 
crop. Curiously, all three of these crops are also important oilseeds.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE NEEDS
China has dominated fiber hemp production for millennia, largely for textile applications, mostly 
for clothing and other woven applications. Specialized harvesting, processing, spinning, and weav-
ing equipment are required for preparing fine hemp textiles. The refinement of equipment and new 
technologies are viewed as offering the possibility of making fine textile production practical in

Western Europe and North America, but at present, China controls this market and probably will 
remain dominant for the foreseeable future. However, the future of fiber hemp development is likely 
based on alternative usages.
Since the early 1980s, the EU provided considerable subsidization for the development of new flax 
and hemp harvesting and fiber processing technologies (because of the similarities of flax and hemp, 
the technologies developed for one usually are adaptable to the other). In addition, various European 
nations and private firms contributed to the development of hemp technologies. Accordingly, Europe 
is far more advanced in hemp development with respect to all fiber-based applications than other 
parts of the world, and harvesting and processing machinery for fiber hemp are highly advanced

in Europe. France is the leading European country in fiber hemp cultivation. It remains to be seen 
whether Europe will continue to dominate in the application of nonwoven applications of hemp fiber 
and, indeed, whether hemp fiber will become more competitive in the future.
Currently, fiber applications of hemp are very limited because of competition with synthetic 
fibers and with other natural fibers. Hemp fiber can potentially replace other biological fibers in 
many applications and can sometimes compete with minerals such as glass fiber and steel. As 
forests diminish, cultivation of annual plants as fiber sources is likely to increase. While crop resi-
dues like cereal straw will probably supply much of the need, specialty fiber plants such as hemp 
also have potential. Bolton (1995) formulated four conditions that should be met for hemp fiber to 
become more competitive: (1) the material should be produced at a large enough scale, (2) the price 
should be low enough, (3) the fiber characteristics should be adequate for the end use, and (4) proven 
technology should be available for the processing of the new raw material. Of these criteria only 
(3) is adequately met at this time for hemp fiber to become truly successful in today’s marketplace. 
However, it should be remembered that hemp has only recently begun to be cultivated for fiber in 
most Western countries after an absence of many years, and it is premature to conclude that its 
future is limited.
A principal roadblock to hemp fiber development is extraction technology. Hemp fibers are 
extracted by retting—by subjecting the stems to rotting, mostly either by exposure to humidity in the 
field or being submerged in water. The latter method produces superior fiber, but the water becomes 
chemically polluted. Such pollution is prohibited in most developed countries, but environmental 
regulations are lax in some places (notably China and some eastern European countries), where 
most of the world’s hemp fiber is produced. Since the 1990s, European countries have attempted 
to produce nonpolluting fiber-extraction technologies, but these are not yet competitive, and hemp 
fiber has been successful in Europe in part because of considerable state subsidies. Bócsa and Karus 
(1998) observed that, “By and large, only EU subsidies make hemp cultivation a profitable venture 
under current economic conditions.” Horn (2010) noted that, “At present in the EU registered hemp 
fiber processors can receive a subsidy of approximately £60 t−1 of extracted fiber under the flax and 
hemp regime to provide additional income for their activities and support production.”

Fiber
Several conclusions can be drawn regarding the economic status of hemp, at least tentatively:
 
1. Hemp is a niche crop, of relatively minor importance today, but one that stimulates consid-
erable investment interest for diversification and product development. Hemp is likely to 
continue experiencing the risks inherent in a niche market for some time.
 
2. Hemp is benefitting from the general reconsideration of the relative merits of synthetic 
fiber, wood fiber, and natural fibers that is occurring, generally favoring a greater usage of 
natural fibers for economic, product suitability, and environmental reasons.
 
3. Since fiber hemp is basically a temperate-region crop, it competes less directly with tropi-
cal bast crops such as sunn hemp, ramie, and jute and the semitropical kenaf, in compari-
son to the considerably more competitive flax, which is also an annual-temperate-region 
bast crop. Lloyd and Seber (1996) compared the advantages and disadvantages of hemp, 
flax, and kenaf, and their analysis suggests that, overall, none is necessarily superior, and 
each crop is preferable depending on circumstances.
 
4. Cannabis sativa has considerable potential as an oilseed crop. Canada has become the 
leading country of hempseed production since industrial hemp was reintroduced in 1998 
(Blade 1998), and the EU is also growing more of this oilseed. Dual-purpose cultivars 
(harvested for both oilseed and fiber) compromise the two crops, and it remains to be 
determined which will become more profitable in the future.
 
5. China, the world’s leading producer of hemp, has an established tradition of producing 
high-quality textile-grade fiber and textile products. China’s hemp fiber industry has the 
advantages of cheap labor and tolerance of water retting, which is environmentally unac-
ceptable in most of the West. New technology is being developed in Western nations to 
compete in this niche, but it is likely that China will remain dominant in the foreseeable 
future.
 
6. The economic resurgence of hemp fiber in the marketplace is based on nontraditional 
usages, particularly in the production of a very wide range of pressed fiber and insulation 
products and plastics. The greatest success of hemp products has been in the automobile, 
construction, and agriculture industries. Market penetration has been prominent in the EU, 
in part because of subsidization (related to “green support” policies), but mainly because 
of superior characteristics of hemp fiber for particular applications.
 
7. It is probable that industrial hemp cultivation will be resumed in the United States, although 
this remains a contentious issue. If this occurs, it is likely to result in a surge of production, 
applications, and development of fiber hemp and a substantial impetus to all aspects of the 
hemp industry.
 
8. Research bearing on the agricultural production and technological exploitation of hemp 
fiber has been very active during the last decade and is critical to the growing success of 
hemp industries.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• The oldest surviving paper is more than 2000 years of age, comes from China, and was 
made from hemp fiber. Egyptian papyrus sheets that might be thought to be an older form 
of paper are not “paper” as this term is understood by experts because the fiber strands 
are woven, not “wet-laid.” Until the early nineteenth century, hemp and flax were the chief 
paper-making materials. Wood-based paper came into use when mechanical and chemical 
pulping was developed in the mid-1800s in Germany and England. Today, at least 95% of 
paper is made from wood pulp.
• The Hmong are one of China’s largest minority ethnic groups (they are known as the Miao 
in China) and are also found in Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. By tradition, they are laid 
to rest in hemp garments (a common practice in China). Hemp must be used for funeral

dress or the ancestors will refuse the dead person’s soul in the afterworld. Each son and 
daughter must give their departed parent hemp trousers or a hemp skirt to be worn in the 
coffin. Depending on the number of children, the deceased may be buried in as many as a 
dozen sets of clothing.
• In ancient Japan, hemp was important in symbolic rites at Shinto shrines and Buddhist 
temples. Objects that had to be made of hemp included bell ropes as thick as legs and the 
noren—a short curtain that hangs over the doorways and brushes the top of the head as 
one enters the room, in order to cause evil spirits to flee out of the body (both of there are 
illustrated in Figure 12.11c). Priests generally dressed in hemp robes. Shinto priests and 
the faithful also used hemp in ceremonies. One such use was the waving of a gohei, a short 
stick with hemp fibers attached to the end. Shaking these sticks above someone’s head 
drove the evil spirits away.
• Japanese martial artists, including Samurai warriors, dressed in hemp. In prebout ceremo-
nies, the reigning Sumo wrestling grand champion carried a giant hemp rope around his 
ample girth to purify the ring and drive away evil spirits.
• An old Japanese legend explains why the earthworm has rings around its body. There once 
were two women hemp weavers, who competed to make the best dress for an upcoming 
holiday. The fast worker had her dress ready on time, but the slow, careful one had only 
completed the neck of her dress, which she had decorated with whitish rings. The slow 
worker persuaded her husband to carry her in a large jar on his back, so that only her neck 
with the completed top of the dress was visible. When the two women met in a public mar-
ket, the slow worker peeked out the top of the jar and mocked the quality of the dress of her 
competitor. A shrill argument resulted, and the agitated husband accidentally dropped the 
jar, revealing his almost naked wife. Ashamed, she buried herself in the earth so she would 
not be seen and turned into an earthworm, with rings around its body.
• Hemp garments were more or less exclusively worn by wealthy Japanese more than a 
thousand years ago. Yukatabira—absorbent hemp bathrobes—were put on after soaking 
in hot springs. The cotton kimono was the common person’s version of these expensive 
bathrobes.
• In an old Japanese religious tradition, rooms of worship were purified by burning hemp 
leaves by the entrance. This would invite the spirits of the departed, purify the room, and 
encourage people to dance.
• Gigantic phalli representing deities were stationed beside roadsides in old Japan, especially 
at crossroads, to bar passage of malignant beings. Wandering pilgrims and travelers prayed 
at the foot of these monuments and were expected to leave small offerings of hemp leaves 
and rice to each one that they passed.
• In Japanese traditional marriages, hemp was a symbolic gift of acceptance and obedience 
from the groom’s family to the bride.
• In 1948, in occupied Japan, American General Douglas MacArthur (1880–1964) and his 
colleagues rewrote the Japanese constitution. They included a Hemp Control Act forbid-
ding cultivation, totally wiping away several thousand years of hemp culture.
• In Shinto belief, hemp symbolizes purity. Accordingly, when a new emperor ascends the 
throne of Japan, he is bound by tradition to wear hemp garments, and there must be a roll 
of hemp at the foot of the royal throne. Anticipating the ascent of a new emperor, a group of 
Shinto farmers planted an illegal hemp crop, and so when Emperor Hirohito died in 1989, 
they had material to make a new hemp robe for the new emperor.
• Reminiscent of the Chinese tradition of using hemp as burial garments, in Norwegian 
folklore, hemp cloth symbolized the beginning and end of life and was used for clothing 
for both birth and burial.
• In the Norwegian valley of Gausdal, people approaching a hemp field would respectfully 
lift their hats as a greeting to the vette, a nature spirit that lived there.

• In eighteenth century Europe, the ends of slim hemp sticks were dipped in sulfur and used 
as matches.
• The first and second drafts of the American Declaration of Independence were written on 
hemp paper. The final version was copied onto animal parchment and signed on August 2, 
1776. The Magna Carta and the King James Bible were also written on hemp paper.
• Hemp was so important in England in the sixteenth century that King Henry VIII (1491–
1547) passed an act in 1533 that fined farmers who failed to grow at least a quarter acre of 
hemp for every 60 acres of arable land that they owned.
• In colonial America, citizens of several colonies were required by law to grow hemp.
• In early America, hemp ropes were commonly used by hangmen to execute the condemned 
(Figure 7.42), and gallows humor often concerned hemp. A “hempen collar” was a hang-
man’s noose. A “hempen widow” was the wife of an executed man. “To die of hempen 
fever” was a way of saying that a man had been hanged. In the Wild West, vigilantes were 
sometimes called “hemp committees,” and “sowing hemp” was a way of saying that some-
one was on his way to being hanged.
• The 1892 World’s Fair in Chicago featured hundreds of architectural “marble” columns 
that were actually made up of hemp and plaster of Paris. Today, similar cement-like mate-
rials made of hemp and plaster of Paris are being used in house construction.
• It has been claimed that hemp was the first “war crop.” In ancient China, land barons waged 
war against each other. Chinese archers made their bowstrings from bamboo fibers, until 
hemp’s greater strength and durability were discovered. Archers equipped with bowstrings 
made of hemp were at a great advantage, so Chinese monarchs set aside large portions of 
land exclusively for hemp for weapons. Ironically, as noted in this chapter, hemp was also a 
major war crop during the Second World War, when foreign supplies of fiber were cut off.

• Millions of tobacco smokers have been unaware that they have been smoking the canna-
bis plant. Cigarette papers have widely employed some hemp fiber, its strength and wet- 
resistance making it ideal for the purpose.
• It is frequently claimed that the earliest Levi jeans were made of hemp. The Levi Strauss 
Company has denied this, but the composition of early fabrics is uncertain, and the com-

in 1906.
• Designer Giorgio Armani created an all-hemp tuxedo for actor Woody Harrelson for his 
attendance at the 1997 Oscars (he was nominated for his performance in The People vs. 
Larry Flynt).

8 Oilseed
INTRODUCTION TO EDIBLE FIXED OIL
In the context of cannabis, “oil” could refer to (1) “fixed” (vegetable) oil from the seed, (2) essen-
tial oil from the glandular secretory trichomes, or (3) “hashish oil,” i.e., solvent extracts rich in 
cannabinoids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (“liquid hemp” is a recent expression 
referring particularly to cannabidiol [CBD]-rich concentrates, especially for vaping; this is some-
times inappropriately called “hemp oil”). This chapter deals with the fixed oil from the seeds of 
Cannabis sativa; the essential oil from the flowering part of the species is discussed in Chapter 9, 
and hashish oil is discussed in Chapter 12. To avoid ambiguity, the oilseed industry often prefers the 
phrase “hempseed oil” rather than “hemp oil.” Although “hemp seed” and “hemp-seed” are often 
encountered, hempseed has become sufficiently familiar that its designation as one word is justi-
fied. Moreover, the term hempseed is parallel with other oilseed crops such as linseed and rapeseed.
Fixed oils are basically triglycerides, which happen to be not only the chief constituents of veg-
etable fats but also the main constituents of the body fat of animals, including humans. They are 
nonvolatile at room temperature (they do evaporate, but very slowly) and are usually obtained from 
seeds by extraction processes. “Vegetable oils” are fixed oils and include hempseed oil, the sub-
ject of this chapter. By contrast, components of essential oils (volatile oils, ethereal oils, terpenes) 
evaporate rapidly, typically producing aroma. Essential oils are frequently obtained by distillation 
and are mostly used to add scent or flavor to prepared materials, but are sometimes employed for 
medicinal purposes.
Vegetable oils are usually distinguished from vegetable fats by the former being liquid at room 
temperature, while the latter are solid. Vegetable oils are of course obtained from plants, mostly 
from “seeds” or “grain” in commercial practice. Vegetable oils are used for food, fuel (“biofuel”), 
medicines, a wide variety of consumer products such as cosmetics, and industrial processing appli-
cations, such as paints and other technical coatings. Some vegetable oils are used for multiple pur-
poses, while others are primarily employed for one product or purpose.
All of the world’s major vegetable oils are edible and are produced primarily for human food, 
although most of this oil is used for other purposes, such as lubricants and soaps. The leading plant 
species responsible for the production of commercial edible oil are palm, soybean, Canola, and sun-
flower (Figure 8.1). Together, they account for about 90% of global edible oil production. (Soybean, 
Canola/rapeseed, cotton, and sunflower are the world’s leading “oilseeds,” valued not just for edible 
oil but also for edible seeds and industrial oil.) Other edible oils with high economic value are 
produced from the seeds of coconut, corn, cotton, mustard, peanut (“groundnut”), safflower, and 
sesame, or the fruits of olive.
The “smoke point” of an oil or fat is the temperature at which smoke becomes evident during 
cooking, often indicating that compounds in the oil are breaking down. (More dangerous is the 
“flash point,” usually a considerably higher temperature at which vapors from the oil can ignite.) 
Cooking oils break down after repeated use, and some should not be used for deep frying more than 
twice. The smoke point of a particular vegetable oil species varies, sometimes substantially, and 
mostly depends on the percentage of an oil’s unsaturation, where saturated oils have a higher smoke 
point. Most oils used for frying and cooking have smoke point values above 200°C. The smoke 
point of hempseed oil is approximately 165°C, which is too low for higher-temperature cooking and 
frying. For culinary purposes, as discussed later, hempseed oil is best used fresh and uncooked, as 
a salad oil for example, but can also be incorporated into a wide range of processed commercial 
prepared foods, such as baked breads.

INTRODUCTION TO HEMPSEED AND HEMP OIL
Cannabis sativa reproduces by small, slightly flattened, lenticular (biconvex) one-seeded fruits 
(Figure 8.2b). As noted frequently in this book, the fruits of Cannabis are botanically termed “achenes,” 
although they are usually referred to as “seeds.” Depending on the cultivar, these usually vary from 2.5 
to 4 mm in diameter and 3 to 6 mm in length (as noted in Chapter 3, wild seeds are notably smaller 
than those of domesticated plants). Thousand-seed-weight of cultivated plants generally ranges from 
8 to 27 g (European cultivar thousand-seed-weight is mostly 17 to 25 g). However, thousand-seed-
weights of up to 67 g have been recorded (Watson and Clarke 1997). Seeds of monoecious cultivars are

usually smaller than those of dioecious cultivars. The seeds are produced in large numbers, clustered 
against the stems, on the upper end of the main stalk (Figure 8.2a) and on the ends of branches. As 
discussed in this chapter, edible oil is extracted from the seeds (Figure 8.2c).
The true “seed” portion is enclosed within the fruit wall (pericarp), which forms the protective 
“hull” or “shell” (Figure 8.3). Most of the seed is filled by an embryo, principally the two cotyledons 
(embryonic leaves), which are rich in oils, proteins, and carbohydrates, upon which the germinating 
seedling relies for nourishment. A rudimentary nutritive tissue (endosperm, rich in aleuron bodies, 
which are protein storage organelles) is also present (Figure 8.3; Theimer and Mölleken 1995).
The taste of hempseed oil is pleasantly nutty, sometimes with a touch of bitter aftertaste. 
Unsaturated fatty acids make up over three-quarters of the fatty acids in hempseed oil. This high 
degree of unsaturation is responsible for extreme sensitivity to oxidative rancidity. The oil has a 
relatively short shelf life. It should be extracted rapidly under nitrogen (to prevent oxidation), stored 
in dark containers that protect against light damage, and refrigerated to avoid degradation caused 
by heat (curiously, all conditions that also promote the shelf life of cannabis drugs). Addition of 
antioxidants may prolong the longevity of the oil. Steam sterilization of the seeds, often required by 
law, allows oxygen to penetrate the protective shell and hasten rancidity. Accordingly, sterilized or 
roasted hemp seeds, and products made from hemp seed that has been subjected to heating, should 
be avoided for human foods.
Hempseed oil varies in color from off-yellow to dark green (Figure 8.2c). The green color is due 
to the presence of chlorophyll, which is extracted along with the oil (Matthäus and Brühl 2008). 
Hempseed oil has often been merchandized in clear glass in order to attract the consumer’s interest, 
but this practice shortens shelf life. Chlorophyll is a photosensitizer, which increases the susceptibil-
ity of the oil to oxidation, and this increases the need for protection from light by using bottles made 
of dark glass. (The presence of some chlorophyll in the achenes, should they be exposed to light, 
could result in some “auto-oxidation,” but this has not been studied. The presence of antioxidants in

the achenes is an obvious adaptation to reduce such oxidation.) The number of green seeds present 
should be minimized after harvesting, to reduce the presence of chlorophyll in the oil. Insufficient 
protection of the oil from light can be indicated by a change in the color of the oil over time from 
green to yellow.
HISTORY
Cannabis seeds were discovered in Chinese tombs over 4500 years of age (Jiang et al. 2006) and 
have been employed for at least 3000 years as food for both humans and livestock (Schultes 1973). 
Indeed, hempseed was one of the “five grains” of ancient China, along with foxtail millet, broom-
corn millet, rice, and barley or wheat (Huang 2000; Figure 8.4) and remained a staple until the 
tenth century, when other grains became more important (Cheatham et al. 2009). Archaeological 
evidence for the food use of hempseed in ancient times in Europe is very limited, but given the 
existence of traditional European hempseed recipes, it seems that for at least centuries, the seeds 
were employed for food to a minor extent (Leson 2013). In the past, hemp seed has generally been a 
food of the impoverished social classes, or a famine food. Often, the whole seed, including the hull, 
was eaten. Crushed peanut-butter-type preparations have been produced from hempseed in Europe 
for centuries but were rather gritty since technology for removing the hulls was rudimentary when 
it existed, and interest in producing commercial hulled hempseed for culinary purposes dates back 
only to about 1990. In some areas of Southeast Asia, the hull was removed by filtration, after grind-
ing the seed in water. The resulting hempseed “milk” was then heated until the proteins solidified 
into curds, which were subsequently pressed to form a solid mass, much like tofu from soy, but 
without the need for chemical precipitants.

lived 2737–2699 BC), to whom the grains, presumably including hempseed, were ritually offered. Illustration

Oilseed
As will be discussed, in very recent times, hemp seeds have been “discovered” to have 
 nutritional-therapeutic, medicinal properties. In fact, hempseed has been employed in the treatment 
of various health disorders for millennia in traditional eastern medicine (Callaway 2004). Historical 
accounts indicate that “hemp seeds” were used for many medical purposes: as an analgesic, for sores 
and skin diseases, and for coughs, jaundice, and colic. However, it is unclear whether hemp seeds 
alone were employed or also the fruit bracts, which would have added cannabinoids (discussed in 
Chapter 11). In ancient China, various parts of the plant were used medicinally, including the foliage 
and roots (Wang and Wei 2012). In recent times in China, hempseed has been used to treat blood 
problems and constipation (Wang and Wei 2012). A traditional Chinese medicine called “hemp seed 
pill” (made in part with hempseed) has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for alleviating 
constipation (Cheng et al. 2011). Maltos-Cannabis, a drink formulated with hempseed, was popular 
in Scandinavia in the early twentieth century as “a health medicine that has been employed with 
great success against pulmonary diseases, anemia, gastric catarrh, scrofula, neurasthenia, asthenia 
and emaciation” (Dahl and Frank 2011; Figure 8.5).
The cultivation of hemp as an oilseed crop reached a zenith in nineteenth and early twenti-
eth century Russia, when, in addition to the edible uses, the seed oil was employed for making 
soap, paints, and varnishes. Until about 1800, hempseed oil was one of the more popular light-
ing oils, being cheaper than whale oil, but kerosene subsequently replaced both for this purpose. 
However, for most of history, the seeds were of very minor economic importance, and by the middle 
of the twentieth century, commercial use was negligible, and cultivated plant selections suitable for 
dedicated oilseed production were virtually unavailable until the 1990s. For most of the latter part 
of the twentieth century, the seeds were usually employed as wild bird and poultry feed, although 
occasionally also as human food. World hemp seed production (mostly in China) fell from about 
70,000 tonnes in the early 1960s to about 34,000 tonnes at the beginning of the twenty-first century 
(Figure 8.6).
At the close of the twentieth century, reminiscent of how new hemp fiber applications resurrected 
the fiber crop mostly in Europe (as discussed in Chapter 7), a similar development of oilseed prod-
ucts, particularly in Canada, witnessed the founding of an expanding hempseed industry by the year 
2000 and a consequent increase in world production as a food crop (Figure 8.6). Cannabis sativa is 
now being grown as a major new source of edible and industrial oilseed products. With the grow-
ing recognition of the health benefits from the dietary use of hempseed oil, discussed in the section 
“Nutritional Qualities of Hemp Seed and Oil,” hempseed production has been increasing. Indeed, 
the economic prospects for continued development as an oilseed crop are considerably better than 
for continued development as a fiber crop.

OIL EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
Pressure extraction
Edible vegetable oils are frequently extracted mechanically from seeds and fruits by the use of 
oil presses. Depending on design, these may be true “mills” or “oil seed mills” (which crush and 
macerate the material), true “presses” (which compress), or a combination (“expeller presses,” 
which squeeze continuously fed material, providing separated streams of oil and solid residue). 
The design of oil presses has evolved from ancient times, when just grinding stones were com-
monly employed (Figure 8.7, left), to complex, huge commercial machinery (Figure 8.7, right). 
Several physical characteristics of hempseed (dimensions, hull proportion, hardness, and frac-
ture characteristics) are very suitable for oil pressing (Berenji et al. 2005). Unlike fiber process-
ing technology, which today is economical only on a large-scale basis, it is possible to carry 
out hempseed oil extraction on a cottage industry scale, using small-capacity screw presses or 
hydraulic presses, which can extract 60%–80% of the oil (Matthäus and Brühl 2008), although 
large-scale processing is much more efficient. The raw seed is first cleaned, then crushed or mac-
erated, and finally squeezed under high pressure, extruding most of the oil and leaving behind a

Oilseed
pasty material (“pomace”), which is occasionally used as fertilizer but is usually compressed into 
“oil cake” (“de-oiled cake” would be a more accurate phrase) or “seed cake,” with about 10% oil 
remaining in the solid material. The oil cake is usually fed to livestock, where regulations allow, 
so it is a valuable secondary product, although sometimes mistermed as a waste product. Seed 
particles are removed from the oil by filtration, sedimentation, and/or centrifugation (these opera-
tions may be considered part of “refining” the oil, which may also include deodorizing and/or 
bleaching with diatomaceous earth). The friction from pressing produces heat, which can degrade 
flavor, aroma, and nutritional value, so the temperature is kept to about 40°C by cooling apparatus 
to produce “cold-pressed oil.” The phrase “cold-pressed oil” is regulated in some jurisdictions, 
but not in others, where it is sometimes used simply to convey the impression that a given oil is of 
particularly high quality. However, it is true that genuine cold-pressed oil can preserve bioactive 
compounds such as essential fatty acids (EFAs), phenolics, flavonoids, and tocopherol (Teh and 
Birch 2013). The desirable properties of these compounds are generally preserved at tempera-
tures less than 50°C, with only brief exposure to temperatures this high. For edible purposes, the 
quality of hempseed oil is improved by using only the first pressing, as a virgin oil. However, the 
key to high quality is to use high-quality grain. Carrying out extraction in an environment free 
of light and oxygen can assist in minimizing degradation. Hempseed oil is mostly employed as 
an edible oil, and so it is standardly cold-pressed. The relatively primitive way that hempseed oil 
was produced in the past amounted to cold-pressing, although this was not necessary for such 
nonedible uses as the manufacture of soaps, paints, varnishes, and lamp fuel oil. Should noned-
ible uses of hempseed oil become popular in the future, different extraction systems would likely 
be employed.
solvent extraction
Some vegetable oils are extracted using heat and/or solvents. These methods are faster, extract more 
oil, and are much more economical, but have been considered to be unsuitable for edible hempseed 
oil because of degradative changes that they cause (Dimić 2005). According to Callaway and Pate 
(2009), “Solvent extraction is used for the inexpensive industrial processing of many vegetable oils, 
although it is not suitable for the production of human food or animal feed because residual sol-
vents (typically hexanes) contaminate the final product.” Nevertheless, solvent extraction systems 
are under investigation for hempseed oil.
When hempseed oil is extracted by solvents, this is most often conducted with n-hexane (Oomah 
et al. 2002; Kostić et al. 2013). Solvent extraction using n-hexane is relatively inexpensive and effi-
cient, but the residual solvent in the oil is potentially hazardous for food purposes, and extraction 
time is longer compared to cold pressing. Lin et al. (2012) examined the effects of using ultrasonic 
sound waves to enhance traditional solvent extraction of hempseed oil and claimed that there are 
benefits.
“Supercritical fluids” are liquefied gases that evaporate rapidly and completely at atmospheric 
pressure. Supercritical carbon dioxide is CO2 that is transformed from a gas to a liquid state by 
keeping it above the “critical” temperature and pressure point. Supercritical carbon dioxide fluid 
extraction is a new commercial and industrial technique that uses liquid CO2 as an extractive solvent 
under pressure. The technique, like the use of conventional chemical solvents, extracts a higher 
percentage of oil than possible with presses, but unlike most solvents, CO2 is nontoxic and nonflam-
mable. This technology is now used in the food industry to extract heat-sensitive, easily oxidized 
compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and has been experimentally employed 
to extract the seed oil of hempseed (Da Porto et al. 2012a,b). The resulting seed residue is virtu-
ally devoid of residual oil, and its protein content can be processed into various food products with 
longer shelf lives. The main disadvantages of this technique, according to Kostić et al. (2014), are 
high costs, high expenditure of time compared to cold pressing, and relatively low throughput when 
compared to industrial-scale processes.

NUTRITIONAL QUALITIES OF HEMP SEED AND OIL
According to an ancient legend (Abel 1980), Buddha (Prince Siddhartha Guatama, died 480 BC; 
Figure 8.8), the founder of Buddhism, survived a six-year interval of asceticism by eating nothing 
but one hemp seed daily. This apocryphal story holds a germ of truth—hemp seed is quite nutri-
tional, primarily because of the very high content of unsaturated fatty acids (of the order of 80% of 
the fatty acids) and digestible protein (ca. 25%). In addition, it has been suggested that other com-
ponents, including trace amounts of terpenes and cannabinoids, could have health benefits (Leizer 
et al. 2000). Good general accounts of dietary aspects of hempseed oil are Jones (1995), Conrad 
(1997), Pate (1998b), Leson et al. (1999), Callaway (2002, 2004), Leson and Pless (2002), Oomah 
et al. (2002), Small (2007), Matthäus and Brühl (2008), and Bureau (2010). The value of hempseed 
oil from the point of view of its primary components is discussed in the remainder of this section.
Fatty acids
Almost all reputable medical organizations have advised that saturated fat is a significant risk factor 
for cardiovascular disease, although this has been disputed by some recent studies, most notably 
that of Chowdhury et al. (2014). The following discussion is based in part on the conventional view 
that unsaturated fats are healthier than saturated fats.
Just as with exaggerated claims for the virtues of fiber hemp and medical marijuana, there have 
also been hyperbolic declarations about the marvels of hempseed oil. Nevertheless, hempseed oil is 
remarkably nutritious. Udo Erasmus’ (1993) book Fats That Heal, Fats That Kill pronounced hemp 
to be “the most perfectly balanced, natural essential fatty acid-rich oil available” and “nature’s 
most perfectly balanced oil.” In fact, the composition of omega-6 and omega-3 EFAs in hempseed 
oil is quite optimal for human metabolism. Hempseed oil contains significant amounts of omega-6 
FIGURE 8.8 Statue of Buddha at a temple in South Korea. The ancient usage of Cannabis for oilseed and 
fiber coincided to a considerable degree with the development of Buddhism in Asia. “Big Buddha Seeds” 
is one of the larger online suppliers of marijuana strains, several with “Buddha” in their names. However, 
Buddhism is opposed to the use of any inebriant, as reflected by the “Fifth Precept”: “abstain from wines, 
liquors and intoxicants that cause heedlessness.” Photo by Steve46814 at en.wikipedia (CC BY 3.0).
 

151
Oilseed
gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and omega-3 stearidonic acid (SDA), which are also produced in 
human bodies from the EFAs. It seems that these “super unsaturated” fatty acids are responsible 
for at least some of the numerous health claims that are currently ascribed to hempseed oil. In any 
event, the best way to achieve a balanced diet is to consume a wide variety of healthy foods, and this 
applies to sources of fats and oils. Given the health-promoting qualities that hempseed possesses, as 
described in the following discussion, hempseed deserves to be added to the human diet.
The quality of an oil or fat is most importantly determined by its fatty acid composition. 
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in 
the backbone of their molecule. By contrast, saturated fatty acid molecules have no double bonds. 
Saturated fat molecules can pack together more easily than unsaturated fats, which is why the former 
are solids at room temperatures while unsaturated fats are liquids. Hempseed oil is of high nutritional 
quality because it contains high amounts (generally over 80%) of PUFAs (Figure 8.9), mostly the 
EFAs linoleic acid (18:2, 50%–60% content in the achenes, depending on strain) and alpha-linolenic 
acid (18:3, 20%–25%). GLA (18:3, 1%–6%) and SDA (18:4, 0%–3%) are also metabolically important 
fatty acids, which are present in hempseed oil. (The C:D ratio notation is a shorthand way to describe 
these molecular species, where C specifies the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and D gives 
the number of double bonds.) Additionally present is the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) oleic 
acid (18:1, 10%–16%), also considered healthy, although oleic acid and other MUFAs are not essential 
for health. Numerous studies have demonstrated that fatty acids are important for human health (e.g., 
Connor et al. 1993; Holub and Holub 2004; Fedor and Kelley 2009; Panza et al. 2009; Wendel and 
Heller 2009). Animal experimentation using hempseed as a dietary source has shown that it has sig-
nificant cardioprotective effects (Prociuk et al. 2006; Al-Khalifa et al. 2007), preventing cholesterol-
induced stimulation of platelet aggregation (Prociuk et al. 2008). Indeed, studies of hempseed intake 
in both humans and laboratory animals have reported that dietary hempseed can induce significant 
improvements in serum lipid profiles in humans and other animals (Callaway et al. 2005; Karimi and 
Hayatghaibi 2006; Schwab et al. 2006; Kang and Park 2007).
GLA is a widely consumed supplement known to affect vital metabolic roles in humans, ranging 
from control of inflammation and vascular tone to initiation of contractions during childbirth (Dimić et 
al. 2009). GLA has been found to alleviate psoriasis, atopic eczema, and mastalgia and may also benefit 
rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular, psychiatric, and immunological disorders (De Luca et al. 1995; 
Clarke 1996; Deferne and Pate 1996; Fan and Chapkin 1998; Yu et al. 2005). Aging, diet, and pathology 
(diabetes, hypertension, alcoholism, etc.) may impair GLA metabolism, making supplementation desir-
able. As much as 15% of the human population may benefit from addition of GLA to their diet

(The Furrow 1990). At present, GLA is available in health food shops and pharmacies primarily as soft 
gelatin capsules of borage (Borago officinalis L.) or evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.) oil, but 
hempseed is almost certainly a much more economic source of GLA and EFAs. Although the content of 
GLA in the seeds is lower, hemp is far easier to cultivate and higher-yielding.
Essential Fatty Acids
Linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are the only two fatty acids that must be obtained from 
the diet to maintain human health and, for this reason, are considered essential to human welfare 
(Callaway 2004). Several other fatty acids are sometimes termed “conditionally essential” because 
they can become essential under some physiological or disease conditions (GLA and SDA, for 
example, discussed in this and the next section). Linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid were once 
designated “vitamin F,” a terminology that has been abandoned. The relative amounts of the EFAs 
vary among different strains (Small and Marcus 2000; Kriese et al. 2004) and with seed maturity 
(Peiretti 2009). In contrast to shorter-chain and more saturated fatty acids, the EFAs usually do not 
serve primarily as energy sources. Instead, the bulk of dietary EFAs serve as raw materials for the 
production of cell membranes and as precursors for the biosynthesis of many of the body’s regula-
tory biochemicals in the course of normal metabolism (Spielmann et al. 1988). The omega-3 fatty 
acids are available in other oils, particularly fish and flaxseed, but these tend to have unpleasant 
flavors compared to the mellow, slightly nutty flavor of hempseed oil.
While the value of unsaturated fats is generally appreciated, it is much less well known that 
many dieticians consider the Western diet to be nutritionally unbalanced by an excess of lin-
oleic (the omega-6 EFA, unsaturated with two double bonds, named “linoleic” because it was 
first identified from linseed oil), over alpha-linonenic acid (the omega-3 EFA, unsaturated with 
three double bonds) (Simopoulos 2002; Figure 8.10). GLA is also an omega-6 fatty acid, and its 
omega-3 analogue is SDA. Both are present in nutritionally significant amounts in hempseed oil, 
and at the same ratio as their EFA precursors. A century ago, the typical North American diet 
ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids was about 1–3:1; today, it is about 10–14:1. In hempseed, 
linoleic and alpha-linolenic occur in a ratio between 2.1 and 3:1. This ratio is considered optimal 
in healthy human adipose tissue and is apparently unique among common plant oils (Deferne and 
Pate 1996). Rapeseed oil has a similar ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, but the overall amounts of 
EFAs are lower, and both GLA and SDA are lacking. (Note, however, that some researchers, such 
as Harris 2006, dispute the medical significance of the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3, although this 
opinion is clearly in the minority.) The primary reasons why an optimal ratio has been proposed 
are the observed negative effect from diets that are too heavy in omega-6 and observations of the

enzyme kinetics for delta-6-desaturase, the enzyme that metabolizes both EFAs to GLA and SDA. 
Too much omega-3 from flaxseed oil, for example, can actually suppress the normal production 
of GLA in humans (Schwab et al. 2006). Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish, such as EPA 
and docosahexanoic acid (DHA), seem to reduce inflammation, prevent heart arrhythmias, dilate 
bloods vessels, and counter blood clotting. By contrast, excessive dietary omega-6 fatty acids pro-
mote an inflammatory response and encourage clotting. When insufficient omega-3 is provided 
(relative to omega-6), there seems to be an increased incidence of common diseases, including 
heart disease, Crohn’s disease, asthma, Alzheimer’s, and some kidney diseases. Rodriguez-Leyva 
and Pierce (2010) pointed out that hempseed oil could be useful for reduction of the symptoms 
of chronic illnesses like coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and cancer, although human research is required to 
validate these claims specifically for hempseed oil.
The essential omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid, which is present in elevated amounts in hempseed 
oil, is of particular significance to cardiovascular health. Linoleic acid is metabolized to produce 
arachidonic acid, which begins a vast and important biochemical metabolic pathway known as 
the arachidonic acid cascade. From this, important classes of chemicals, including eicosanoids, 
prostaglandins, leukotriens, and even endocannabinoids (see Chapter 13), are produced to regulate 
many biological processes (Simopoulos 2008). Hempseed is thought to have potential for reducing 
platelet aggregation and, therefore, blood clots, which initiate heart attacks and stroke; however, 
animal studies and limited human studies to date have not yet clarified the relative value of hemp-
seed oil consumption (Rodriguez-Leyva and Pierce 2010). Hempseed protein contains a significant 
amount of the amino acid arginine, which is an important chemical in the normal regulation of 
blood pressure.
Seo et al. (2012) noted, “Cardiovascular disease is a principal cause of mortality in many coun-
tries, and accounts for up to 16.7 million deaths annually. Cardiovascular disease is primarily 
caused by atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the arteries that generally clinically 
manifests as thrombosis. In the past, atherosclerosis was thought to be due to a passive accumula-
tion of cholesterol in the blood vessel wall. However, current data corroborate the hypothesis that 
atherosclerosis involves chronic inflammatory features… Hempseed might prove to be a promis-
ing…anti-atherosclerotic… Although several previous studies have attempted to characterize the 
effects of dietary hempseed intake, its effects on atherosclerotic heart disease have yet to be thor-
oughly elucidated.”
Minor Fatty Acids
There are other fatty acids in small concentrations in hemp seed that have some dietary signifi-
cance, including SDA (18:4, up to 2.5% in the achenes), an omega-3 fatty acid (Callaway et al. 
1996), and eicosenoic acid (20:1, about 1%), an omega-9 fatty acid (Mölleken and Theimer 1997). 
Nutritional supplements featuring SDA are currently made from black currant (Ribes species) seed, 
but some hemp cultivars are potential alternative sources. SDA is apparently not an important 
human dietary supplement because we normally make it ourselves from dietary alpha-linolenic 
acid. However, SDA supplementation may be helpful for infants and the elderly, who tend to be 
deficient in delta-6-desaturase activity (Pate 1998b). Eicosenoic acid is important in the production 
of cerebrosides, which are components of nerve membranes and the “white matter” of the brain.
tocoPherols
Tocopherols are major dietary antioxidants in human serum (Mölleken et al. 2001). Alpha-, beta-, 
gamma-, and delta-tocopherol represent the vitamin E group. They can comprise up to 0.1% of hemp-
seed oil. These fat-soluble vitamins are essential for human nutrition. About 80% of the  tocopherols 
in hempseed oil are in the gamma form. The vitamin E content of hempseed is comparatively 
high relative to other dietary oils. Natural antioxidants in hempseed oil, such as alpha-tocopherol, 
 

154

stabilize the highly polyunsaturated oil, thus keeping it from going rancid, at least within the intact 
seed (Kamal-Eldin and Appelqvist 1996; Sapino et al. 2005; Yu et al. 2005).
sterols
Up to about 0.7% of hempseed oil may be phytosterols, such as sitosterol and campesterol (Matthäus 
and Brühl 2008). Sterols in hemp seeds, like the tocopherols, probably serve the same antioxi-
dant function of protecting the seed oil and are also desirable from a human health viewpoint. 
Phytosterols are membrane constituents in all plants. Medically, they are known to reduce total 
blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in serum and so seem to be 
therapeutic for atherosclerosis (Malini and Vanithakumari 1990; Mölleken et al. 2001; Miettinen 
and Gylling 2004; Patch et al. 2006).
Protein
Hempseed protein has recently become very popular as a nutritional supplement, although evidence 
for its health value is relatively limited. Hemp seeds contain 25%–30% protein, with all eight of the 
amino acids that are essential in the human diet and a reasonably complete amino acid spectrum, 
although lysine is relatively low as in most vegetable protein (Tang et al. 2006); however, arginine is 
relatively high (and is discussed in the next section). About two-thirds of hempseed protein is of the 
edestin (legumin) type, which is easily digestible. Hemp protein also includes vegetable albumin, 
which is also easily digested and has a reasonable balance of amino acids, comparable to that of soy-
bean or egg white (Callaway 2004). Although the total protein content in hemp seed is smaller than 
that of soybean, hemp protein is much higher than in grains like wheat, rye, maize, oat, and barley 
(House et al. 2010), and it is well suited to human consumption (Wang et al. 2008b). The oilcake 
remaining after oil is expressed from the seeds is employed as a very nutritious feed supplement for 
livestock, but it also has potential for production of a high-protein flour for humans.
Proteins are potential allergens, but human allergies to hemp protein have rarely been reported 
(Stadtmauer et al. 2003; Gamboa et al. 2007; Nayak et al. 2013). Fractions of hemp protein have 
been experimentally demonstrated to reduce hypertension in rats (Girgih et al. 2011). Hempseed 
lacks gluten proteins and is suitable for those with gluten intolerance.
Arginine
Rodriguez-Leyva and Pierce (2010) noted that hempseed contains “surprisingly high levels of the 
amino acid arginine, a metabolic precursor for the production of nitric oxide, a molecule now recog-
nized as a pivotal signaling messenger in the cardiovascular system that participates in the control 
of hemostasis, fibrinolysis, platelet and leukocyte interactions with the arterial wall, regulation of 
vascular tone, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and homeostasis of blood pressure… 
individuals may be able to decrease their risk for cardiovascular disease by following a diet that is 
high in arginine-rich foods.”
Phenolics
Phenolics (phenols) include chemical compounds with a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to an aro-
matic hydrocarbon group (with one or more six-carbon rings; sterols, noted previously, are struc-
turally similar, but the hydroxyl group bond is different). The largest group of phenolics is the 
flavonoids. The cannabinoids are also phenols. CBD, with two phenolic groups, is a polyphenol. 
Phenolic compounds are effective antioxidants and often have additional physiologically beneficial 
effects such as cardioprotection and anti-inflammation. Hemp seed is rich in phenols and polyphe-
nols (Vonapartis et al. 2015).
 

155
Oilseed
other signiFicant dietary constituents
Hempseed is considered to be a good source of carbohydrates (20%–30%), dietary fiber (10%–
15%; about 20% of the fiber is digestible), and minerals (4%–6%), particularly calcium, iron, 
magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and zinc (Theimer and Mölleken 1995; Deferne and 
Pate 1996; Pate 1998b).

In Chapter 11, it is noted that the concentration of THC, the principal intoxicant of C. sativa, depends 
to an extent on the environment in which the plant develops, the genetics of the seed, and if the female 
flower has been pollinated. Similarly, the relative percentage of oil in the seeds has been observed to vary 
with variety, year of cultivation, climatic conditions, and location (Matthäus and Brühl 2008; Grigor’ev 
et al. 2010). Environment can also alter the fatty acid quality (profile) of Cannabis seed. This was dem-
onstrated by Przybylski et al. (1997), who compared oilseed quality of hemp grown in Canada (under 
colder conditions) with the same varieties grown in Europe (under warmer conditions). The Canadian-
grown seed oil was about 15% higher in unsaturated fatty acids, with about 10% more of alpha-linolenic 
acid and GLAs. Theimer and Mölleken (1995) similarly noted that hemp grown in warmer areas tends to 
produce oil with more saturated fatty acids, and indeed, this pattern has been recorded for other oilseed 
plants. It appears that a cooler climate may be preferable for development of the unsaturated fatty acids, 
but if the growing season is too short, grain productivity can be low and the fatty acid profile may be 
inferior. The more unsaturated a fatty acid is, the lower is its freezing point (i.e., changing from a liquid to 
a solid form). Callaway and Pate (2009) suggested that this protects the seeds from low winter tempera-
tures in colder regions. Ross et al. (1996) noted that, with increasing maturation of the seeds, consistent 
with observations of many other oilseed plants, the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids increases and 
the percentage of saturated fatty acids decreases in the mature seed.
HOW DOMESTICATION HAS ALTERED CANNABIS SATIVA 
FOR OILSEED PRODUCTION
review oF Key inFormation Presented in Previous chaPters
In Chapter 3, it was noted that “seeds” (achenes) in domesticated plants of C. sativa differ in several 
respects from those of wild plants. This information is not repeated here, but it should be noted that 
oilseed hemp seeds show all of the features characteristic of domesticated plant seeds.
Chapter 5, dealing with photoperiodism, pointed out that plants of C. sativa are locally adapted 
to increasingly shorter seasons of northern latitudes by becoming smaller, and this pattern applies 
to plants grown for oilseed, as well as those cultivated for fiber and intoxicating chemicals. The 
very popular, northern, early-flowering oilseed cultivar FINOLA is autoflowering (day-neutral); the 
flowering date is not affected by day length, although the flowering time may be shortened by other 
environmental variables, such as drought.
Chapter 6, which discusses the evolution of shoot architecture and planting density patterns in 
the various kinds of domesticated plants, supplements the information presented here on oilseed 
varieties. It was pointed out that plants grown either for marijuana or seeds are spaced sufficiently 
apart to provide for branches (hence flowers, seeds, and THC content) to develop well, and likely, 
farmers learned the appropriate planting density required to maximize seed production (while keep-
ing in mind that weeds are a common problem when planting density is low).
Chapter 7, which discusses fiber production, noted that there are currently very few cultivars 
bred specifically for oilseed production, and indeed, most hemp seed is currently obtained from 
so-called “dual usage” plants (employed for harvest of both fiber and seeds), which are not capable 
of producing as much seed as oilseed varieties. As noted in Chapter 7, growing hemp to the stage 
 

156

that mature seeds are present compromises the quality of the fiber, because of lignification in the 
stem. As well, the woody hurds that are useful as a secondary product become more difficult to 
separate. The lower-quality fiber, however, is quite utilizable for pulp and other nonwoven usages. 
It seems that generally in the past, as in the present, when seeds were harvested from cultivated 
C. sativa, they came from plants that were usually grown additionally for other purposes, either for 
fiber or marijuana. Of the dual-usage cultivars, the European cultivars Uniko B and Fasamo and the 
Canadian cultivar Anka are particularly suited to being grown as a source of oilseed. FINOLA, an 
oilseed cultivar, can also be grown for dual usage.
the traditional use oF tall, highly Branched Plants to Produce hemPseed
From time immemorial, China has been the world’s major producer of hempseed. Small and Marcus 
(2000) examined the growth of Chinese hemp land races, which were quite branched (Figure 8.11) 
and so capable of very high production of seeds. Chinese hemp grown for dual usage or just for 
seeds are typically planted at lower densities than hemp grown only for fiber, as this promotes 
branching, although it should be understood that the genetic propensity for branching of cultivars 
has been selected. It appears clear that considerable branching is a characteristic that farmers have 
stressed in order to maximize seed production.
Dewey (1914) noted that a Turkish type of land race called Smyrna was commonly used in the 
early twentieth century in the United States to produce birdseed because (like most marijuana types 
FIGURE 8.11 A highly branched Chinese land race capable of considerable seed production.
 

157
Oilseed
of Cannabis and unlike fiber types) it is quite branched, producing many flowers, hence seeds. 
Indeed, Dewey’s description of Smyrna is reminiscent of the well-branched kind of Chinese land 
race shown in Figure 8.11.
Based on the preceding discussion, it seems that large, well-branched plants have been the stan-
dard form of plant used particularly for seed production in the past. However, such plants have been 
grown not just for seeds but also either for fiber or for marijuana, and so they are “general purpose” 
kinds.
the use oF short, comPact Plants to Produce hemPseed
Until very recent times, the widespread cultivation of hemp primarily as an oilseed was largely 
unknown, except in pre–World War II Russia. It is uncertain whether the kind of Russian land races 
once grown as oilseeds are still extant. It is difficult to reconstruct the type of hemp plant that was 
grown in Russia as an oilseed crop because (1) such cultivation has essentially been abandoned and 
(2) land race germplasm in the Vavilov Research Institute (St. Petersburg) seed bank, the world’s 
largest public cannabis seed collection, has been extensively hybridized (Small and Marcus 2003; 
Hillig 2004b) due to inadequate maintenance. A land race certainly was grown in Russia spe-
cifically for seeds, and Dewey (1914) gave the following information about it: “The short oil-seed 
hemp with slender stems, about 30 inches high, bearing compact clusters of seeds and maturing in 
60 to 90 days, is of little value for fiber production, but the experimental plants, grown from seed 
imported from Russia, indicate that it may be valuable as an oil-seed crop to be harvested and 
threshed in the same manner as oil-seed flax.”
While oilseed land races in northern Russia would have been short, early-maturing plants in 
view of the short growing season, in more southern areas, oilseed landraces would be expected 
to have had moderate height and to be spaced more widely to allow abundant branching and seed 
production to develop. Curiously, land races from Russia have been observed to be shorter as sowing 
latitude decreases, not taller (J. Callaway, personal communication).
There are only a few cultivated varieties currently available that have been bred specifically for 
the production of grain. Some very recently bred oilseed cultivars are short, compact, and ideal 
for high-density planting. These include FINOLA, formerly known as FIN-314 (Figure 8.12), 
which is relatively short and little-branched, matures early in north-temperate regions, and is 
ideal for high-density planting and harvest with conventional equipment. It appears that modern 
hempseed breeders have intuitively or intentionally reconstructed the kind of plant that used to 
be grown in Russia for oilseed. Low stature is desirable in oilseed selections to avoid channeling 
the plants’ energy into stem tissue, in contrast to fiber cultivars, for which a very tall main stalk is 
desired. Compact clustering of seeds also decreases stem tissue, promotes retention of seeds, and 
facilitates collection. The efficiency of grain production by crops is often measured by “harvest 
index,” the ratio of harvested grain to above-ground dry matter, and crop breeders are strongly 
motivated to increase the harvest index by maximizing grain yield while minimizing other plant 
tissues. Modern selection is also occurring with regard to mechanized harvesting, particularly the 
ability to grow in high density as single-headed stalks with very short branches bearing consid-
erable seed, an architecture that not only maximizes harvest index but also facilitates machine 
harvesting.
Plants with limited (or at least short) branching are naturally superior to irregularly branch-
ing plants for the purpose of fully and uniformly occupying a field and maximally utilizing solar 
irradiation. This is obviously desirable for optimizing production, a very important goal in modern 
plant breeding that will become increasingly significant. As a matter of interest, short plants with 
compact branching is an architecture that has been selected not just for oilseed production but also 
for producing marijuana (see the discussion of the “indica type” of marijuana plant in Chapters 12, 
13, and 17).

selection For seed characteristics
Seed Whiteness
This section examines relative seed whiteness (lightness of hue), which appears to have been 
selected in domesticated Cannabis as a result of human preference.
Seeds that are edible and therefore attractive to various herbivores need to be inconspicuous, 
and Chapter 3 discussed how a camouflagic mottled layer based on perianth (petal tissue) covering 
the achenes of wild C. sativa serves to hide them from herbivores. It was also pointed out that this 
FIGURE 8.12 Fields of C. sativa FINOLA, the first hemp cultivar developed exclusively for grain. The 
low stature facilitates machine harvest and the limited branching minimizes production of stem tissue while 
allowing a substantial number of plants to be grown in a given area, maximizing production on an acreage 
basis. Top: The breeder, Dr. J.C. Callaway, is shown (photo by Anita Hemmilä, Finola Inc.). Bottom: A har-
vester gathering the crop (photo by J.C. Callaway, Finola Inc.).

Oilseed
layer tends to be sloughed off in domesticated strains because it is no longer needed since humans 
protect the plants against herbivores. The exposed outer layer of the seed (actually fruit) has been 
observed to differ in shading—either light or dark. Figure 8.13a contrasts the quite dark seeds of a 
domesticated marijuana strain (typical of the “seeds” of numerous criminal confiscations observed 
in Canada) and the much lighter seeds of a fiber variety (indeed, most European cultivars have seeds 
that tend to be lighter shades of brown or gray). In these samples, the camouflagic perianth layer is 
absent and the color pigmentation resides in the “pericarp” (achene wall, surrounding the true seed). 
(It should be noted that achenes exposed to sunlight for long periods may become bleached and that 
light coloring is also characteristic of immature seed.)
Larger achenes are appropriately planted deeper in the soil, and this may be related to their color. 
Kluyver et al. (2013) proposed that ancient agricultural practices buried seeds quite deeply, leading 
to an increase in seed size under domestication so that seedlings would have the energy to grow out 
of the soil. Deeply buried seeds are probably more protected against herbivores and may therefore 
be more tolerant of light coloration which would tend to attract herbivores. However, darkness of 
the pericarp of domesticated achenes does not seem to be correlated with their size. Differences in 
darkness of pericarps among domesticated strains of C. sativa may be the result of random fixation, 
but they may also reflect a frequently observed preference for light-colored achenes in other species, 
as exemplified in Figure 8.13b and c (for additional examples of similar color selection of fruits and 
seeds, see Heiser 1988; Small 2013a).
The presence of lighter-colored achenes in European fiber hemp cultivars has been recorded by 
Vavilov (1931) and Serebriakova (1940). Lighter-colored achenes also are present in Chinese fiber 
strains, and indeed, Clarke and Merlin (2013) hypothesized that Chinese fiber strains imported into 
Europe in the nineteenth century contributed genes to European land races and were responsible for

the origin of lighter-colored achenes in European cultivars. However, human preference for lighter-
colored propagules seems to be so universal that probably such selection occurred independently 
in Europe and China. It is possible that lighter-colored achenes arose in Cannabis not because of 
a human preference for lighter color but because lighter color is associated with some other aspect 
of the achenes that is of value. Diederichsen and Raney (2006) found that in a large collection of 
oilseed flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) lighter-colored (yellow) seeds were heavier and had a higher 
oil content than darker-colored (brown) seeds, and it seems possible that the lighter color of the flax 
seeds is the result of correlation with selection for larger, more nutritious seeds.
Seed Size vs. Seed Quantity
Although some forms of C. sativa have quite large seeds, until recently, oilseed forms appear to 
have been selected mainly for a heavy yield of seeds. In Europe, most cultivars have been selected 
for fiber yield, and these do not differ much in oilseed potential (Mölleken and Theimer 1997). By 
contrast, some drug strains (which have been selected for prodigious production of flowers), when 
left to go to seed, can yield a kilogram of seeds on a single plant (Clarke and Merlin 2013). Piluzza 
et al. (2013) reported that the seeds of fiber cultivars are larger than those of drug strains, which is 
consistent with fiber plants having a more extensive historical food usage for seeds than those of 
drug forms.
Fatty Acid Quality
Percentage and quality of oil in the seeds do not appear to have been important in the past, in part 
because techniques for analyzing the nutritional chemicals were simply not available until fairly 
recently. Theimer and Mölleken (1995) concluded that breeding to obtain hemp varieties producing 
oils with specifically desired fatty acids had not taken place, although selection for oil quality is 
now being conducted.
Hull Thickness
As noted in Chapter 3, domesticated achenes are thinner-walled than wild achenes, and thinness 
of pericarp (hull) is an important criterion for modern hemp oil seed breeders since the pericarp is 
a waste product. Small and Marcus (2000) surveyed 62 accessions and found the hull varied from 
about 30% to 42% of the weight of the seed.
HEMP SEED AND OIL CULINARY LIMITATIONS
Hemp seeds and hempseed oil are tasty, with an attractive nutty taste when fresh. Untreated hemp-
seed is normally not susceptible to oxidative deterioration during storage because the protective 
seed hull prevents oxygen from reaching the fatty acids. However, because of fear of viable seeds 
being used to produce plants, in some jurisdictions, only sterilized seeds or hulled seed is com-
mercially available. Because of the very high content of unsaturated fatty acids (of the order of 
80%), heat-treated hempseed and its extracted oil are easily oxidized. Hulled hempseed is normally 
marketed as a hand food, in closed containers, and once opened, it should be consumed promptly.
There are two consequences of the susceptibility to oxidation of hempseed oil. (1) Heat produces 
oxidation much more rapidly for hemp than for most of the common edible oils, so hempseed oil 
deteriorates so rapidly when heated that it is unsuitable for frying. As noted in the early part of this 
chapter, the smoke point, i.e., the temperature when smoke is produced, is low for hempseed oil, 
adding to its poor performance as a frying oil. (2) The storage life is also limited, unless the oil is 
frozen and protected from light.
Callaway and Pate (2009) made the following recommendations regarding cooking tempera-
tures: “In general, the use of hempseed oil in any type of cooking should be limited to the tem-
perature of boiling water. Interestingly, the internal temperature of baking bread does not surpass 
this threshold. At most, the temperature of hempseed oil should not exceed about 120°C, which is 
 

161
Oilseed
approximately the temperature found in pressure-cooking, and then only for relatively short periods 
of time.”
Hempseed oil is best stored in glass, ceramic, or glazed-metal containers. The oil should be 
consumed within a short time after a bottle is opened because of degradation due to oxygen in air. 
Cold storage of the oil, bottled under nitrogen, in sealed, light-proof containers, and possibly with 
the addition of antioxidants, will prolong shelf life. Small bottles that can be used up in a short 
time are recommended. Matthäus and Brühl (2008) noted that once bottles are opened, within two 
months a fishy or varnish-like smell reminiscent of linoleum, paint, or putty can result, and such oil 
should not be used for human consumption. Because of its susceptibility to oxidation, hempseed oil 
is mostly used fresh as a salad oil or in processed foods with short shelf lives.
PROCESSED FOOD PRODUCTS FOR HUMANS
For human consumption, the achene is hulled (=dehulled); that is, the inedible shell covering is removed. 
The remaining edible portion is the embryo. Hulled hemp seed (Figure 8.14, right) is a very recent 
phenomenon, first produced in quantity in Germany. The quality of modern hemp seed for human con-
sumption far exceeds anything produced historically. Commercial hemp seed is now often found canned 
or vacuum-packed for the human food markets (Figure 8.14, left). “Hemp nut” is hulled hemp seed. 
(“HempNut” was a trademark that lapsed into the public domain. “Hemp Hearts,” also trademarked, 
is used in North America.) Modern seed hulling uses mechanical separation and cleaning to produce a 
smooth, white, gritless hempseed embryo that needs no additional treatment before it is consumed. This 
product should be distinguished from the protein-rich, oil-poor seed cake that remains after oil has been 
expressed from the seed. Ordinarily, seed cake from other oilseeds is used for livestock feed. Instead, a 
protein-rich powder is sometimes sieved from hempseed cake for human food markets.
Hemp seeds and hempseed oil are incorporated into many food preparations, sometimes mim-
icking familiar foods (Figure 8.15). These include nutritional (granola-type) or snack bars, “nut 
butters” and other spreads, bread, pretzels, cookies, yogurts, pancakes, muffins, porridge, fruit 
crumble, frozen desserts (“ice cream”), pasta, burgers, pizza, salt substitute, salad dressings, may-
onnaise, “cheese,” and beverages (“lemonade,” “beer,” “wine,” and “coffee nog”). One of these 
products, “hemp milk,” comprising a filtered watery mixture of crushed seed, is new in Western 
countries but is a traditional drink in southern China (Tang et al. 2009). Alcoholic beverages made 
with hemp utilize hemp essential oil as a flavorant. Hemp food products currently have a niche mar-
ket, based particularly on natural food and specialty food outlets. As the production area increases 
and prices decrease, foods from hemp seed will become more common in the Western diet because 
the taste and nutritional profile are exceptional.

RAW HEMPSEED SPROUTS FOR HUMANS
Sprouts (recently germinated, live, edible seedlings) of various species (e.g., mung, alfalfa, mustard, 
cress) are widely marketed and consumed as an especially healthy form of vegetable, since the ger-
mination process often makes some nutritious constituents more available, and sometimes detoxifies 
constituents that protect seeds from being consumed by wild herbivores. Improperly produced sprouts 
can be contaminated with microorganisms, and periodic outbreaks of disease occur because of inade-
quate commercial production practices. Nevertheless, in a world dominated by nutritionally unhealthy 
processed foods, sprouts represent a marvellously healthy contribution to our diet. Hempseed sprouts 
are just germinated hemp seeds, and while information on their nutritional qualities has not been care-
fully researched, almost certainly, they are at least as nutritious as commonly sold seed sprouts. Young 
hemp seedlings have hardly begun to produce secretory trichomes or cannabinoids, so the production 
of cannabinoids should not be an issue. However, sprouts of C. sativa are living plants of C. sativa 
and therefore may be illicit in many countries. Sprouts can be used to produce mature plants and so 
are of concern to law enforcement. Of course, viable seeds of C. sativa can also be used to produce 
mature plants, and so these may also be forbidden to the general public (and unfortunately, as noted 
in this chapter, sterilizing hemp seed greatly hastens rancidity). Hempseed sprouts could be marketed 
frozen (or otherwise preserved), or in a processed state, although sprouts are almost universally mar-
keted fresh. At present, the prospects of developing a hempseed sprout industry seem dismal (at least 
in North America, which, unlike much of the world, controls commerce in viable seeds). However, 
there may well be a biotechnological way of generating sprouts that satisfy regulations. As with most 
consumer products produced from C. sativa, many would find “hemp sprouts” worth buying, while 
others would find reasons to condemn “marijuana sprouts.” This issue requires education, as hemp-
seed sprouts do not contain significant amounts of cannabinoids, and hemp is not marijuana.

RECIPE SOURCES
Hempseed recipes date back many years, as evidenced by the following from a fifteenth century 
Italian cookery book (after Van Winter 1981): “To make a hemp dish for twelve guests, boil one 
pound of shelled hemp seeds until they burst. When they are ready, add a pound of white well 
ground almonds, grind the mixture in a mortar with bread crumbs, then bind it with a clear meat 
or poultry broth and rub it through a horse-hair sieve into a saucepan. Place in on a stove, well 
away from the flame, and stir it frequently. When it is almost ready, add half a pound of sugar, half 
an ounce of ginger, a little saffron and rose water. When it is cooked and has been put into bowls, 
sprinkle it with sweet spices.”
With the growing popularity of hempseed, recipe books for hemp have become common. 
Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the title whether these books are dedi-
cated to hempseed or to the preparation of edible marijuana foods. Examples of recipe books dedi-
cated to hempseed include Benhaim (2000), Cicero (2001), Dalotto (1999), Hiener and Mack (1999), 
Krieger and Krieger (2000), Leson et al. (1999), Rose et al. (2004), Suzanne (2009), and Woodland 
Publishing (2005).
ANIMAL FEED
BeneFicial asPects
Hemp seeds have traditionally been employed as bird and poultry rations, but feeding the entire 
seeds to livestock has been considered to be a poor investment because of the current high cost 
involved (subsidization in Europe has allowed such usage, especially in France, although most of 
the hempseed in Europe is imported from China, as birdfeed). Higher yield and better harvesting 
practices may make whole hempseed an economical livestock feed in the future as the cultivation 
area continues to increase.
There have been many studies of how much hempseed or hempseed by-products can be used as 
livestock feed. Gibb et al. (2005) found that including 14% hempseed in the finishing period of steers 
had no detrimental effect on their growth or feed efficiency and resulted in brisket tissues that were 
lower in saturated fat and higher in unsaturated fat (and presumably healthier for human consump-
tion). The seed cake (press-cake, seed meal) left after expressing the oil has proven to be excellent 
for cows, sheep, and lambs (Mustafa et al. 1999), and Hessle et al. (2008) also found that hempseed 
cake is excellent feed for cattle. Karlsson et al. (2010) observed beneficial effects from hempseed 
cake on milk quality of dairy cows (but beyond an ideal proportion of the diet, increasing hemp-
seed cake decreased quality of milk). Reminiscent of the study of Gibb et al. (2005), Silversides and 
LeFrançois (2005) found that feeding hempseed cake to hens resulted in no significant differences 
for egg production, feed consumption, feed efficiency body weight change, or egg qualities (except 
that the eggs had lower saturated fats and higher unsaturated fats and were therefore healthier for 
human consumption). Khan et al. (2010) fed powdered whole seeds up to 20% of the diet of broil-
ers and concluded that the feed was beneficial and that the eggs had sufficient amounts of alpha- 
linolenic acid to be marketed as omega-3 eggs. Eriksson and Wall (2012) found that inclusion of 
hempseed cake did not affect the productivity of organically produced broilers. Hempseed oil has 
been used up to 12% in laying hen diets, and hempseed up to 20%, without exerting adverse effects 
on growth performance (Gakhar et al. 2012). Goldberg et al. (2012) reported similar results for 
hempseed oil. Hullar et al. (1999) found that hempseed cake was beneficial for pigeons. Konca and 
Beyzi (2012) found that hempseed cake may constitute up to 10% of the diet of Japanese quail. 
Webster et al. (2000) observed that hempseed cake was a good feed for sunshine bass (Morone 
chrysops × M. saxatilis), and it is used to feed carp in France. Pedrosa (2008) and Rema et al. (2010) 
found that hempcake and hempseed oil were useful feeds for juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maxi-
mus). Lee et al. (2010) found that hempseed speeded up the growth and resulted in larger size of 
Drosophila melanogaster flies (not to suggest that these insects are suitable as human food).
 

164
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Additives and Products or Substances 
Used in Animal Feed (2011), a comprehensive committee-based review of hempseed as animal 
feed, came to the following evaluation: Three classes of feed materials may be derived from hemp-
seed: whole seed (26% to 37.5% lipids, 25% crude protein, and 28% fiber), hemp seed meal/cake 
(about 11% lipids, 33% crude protein, and 43% fiber), and hemp seed oil (about 56% linoleic and 
22% alpha-linolenic acid). Hemp protein isolate from the seeds could also be used as feed, if eco-
nomics allowed. Hempseed and hempseed cake can be used as feed materials for most animal 
species. Felines, however, do not metabolize the EFAs very effectively and should not be fed a diet 
that is rich in vegetable fatty acids. Suggested maximum incorporation rates of hempseed in the 
complete feed could be 3% in poultry for fattening, 5%–7% in laying poultry and 2%–5% in pigs 
for both hempseed and hempseed cake, 5% in ruminants for hemp seed cake, and 5% in fish for 
hemp seed. With fish, however, the limiting factor is the amount of vegetable fiber, which increases 
intestinal motility while decreasing nutritional absorption and increasing pollution levels of farmed 
fish. These suggested amounts should be considered conservative (i.e., experience may show that 
higher amounts are acceptable).
Callaway and Pate (2009) noted that the tough shell of whole hempseed can limit digestibility if 
it is part of a meal or if whole seeds are fed to animals. However, hempseed hull contains phytos-
terols and other nutritional components, so it is not without value. Availability of sandy gravel to 
poultry and other birds (so they can utilize it in their crops for grinding) can facilitate avian con-
sumption of whole hempseed.
Utilization of hemp stalk, leaves, and other portions of the plant (which may contain some seeds) 
as silage for livestock is discussed in Chapter 10.
harmFul asPects
Hemp seeds improperly prepared without removal of the resin-rich perigonal bracts can make birds 
giddy (Matsunaga et al. 1998). Yousofi et al. (2011) found that female rats fed only a 100% hemp-
seed diet from premating to lactation produced fewer pups and less milk (and they recommended 
against such a severe diet for pregnant humans!). Stadtmauer et al. (2003) recorded a case of human 
anaphylaxis related to ingestion of hempseed in a restaurant setting, yet no other reports have been 
published to support this observation.
Russo and Reggiani (2013) examined oilseed cake from Italian and French cultivars for the pres-
ence of several antinutritive properties (phytic acid, condensed tannins, trypsin inhibitors, cyano-
genic glycosides, and saponins). They expressed concern about the levels of phytic acid, which they 
cautioned could lead to mineral deficiencies if fed to excess. So far, there are no reports to suggest 
that this actually happens, and there is no evidence to suggest that this may occur to a greater extent 
than can be expected from other vegetable food that contain similar amounts of phytic acid.
The negative effects of feeding marijuana and other nonseed drug preparations to livestock and 
companion animals are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.
NUTRACEUTICAL EXTRACTS (DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS), 
FUNCTIONAL FOODS, AND FORTIFIED FOODS
As explained previously, both hempseed and hempseed oil have nutritional and therapeutic proper-
ties. The hempseed industry is now producing a range of extracts to maintain or increase health (e.g., 
Figure 8.16) and is promoting the nutritional advantages of incorporating hempseed and hempseed 
oil in foods. Nutritive therapeutic seed products from C. sativa are based mostly on the seed oil and 
particularly on the exceptional fatty acid profile. Quite unlike the highly regulated and legislated 
prescription environment in which cannabis is employed as a drug, the medicinal-nutritional use of 
seed products is part of the free marketplace, particularly in the health food industry.
 

165
Oilseed
With the expanding market for herbal components in health foods, marketing terms have devel-
oped, such as “medical foods,” “pharma foods,” and “phytofoods.” Two terms, “nutraceuticals” 
and “functional foods,” have become widespread, but their meanings have varied somewhat (Small 
and Catling 1999), particularly in North America. The term “nutraceutical” (sometimes spelled 
“nutriceutical” in the past) was coined by Dr. Stephen DeFelice of the Foundation for Innovative 
Medicine, a New Jersey–based industry group. His definition was “a food derived from naturally 
occurring substances which can and should be consumed as part of the daily diet, and which serves 
to regulate or otherwise affect a particular body process when ingested.” However, the term “nutra-
ceutical” is now commonly applied to an extremely wide variety of preparations with perceived 
medicinal value, but not necessarily with apparent food value. The phrase “functional food” is 
also not without controversy, especially in North America. Some have contended that fruits and 
vegetables should be included in “functional foods” because they are so nutrient packed, while oth-
ers reserve this term for foods that have a measurable effect on a medical condition. For example, 
in a randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial, Callaway et al. (2005) showed that dietary 
hempseed oil relieved symptoms of atopic dermatitis (eczema). The same research group also dem-
onstrated that dietary hempseed oil reduced the ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol in normal volunteers (Schwab et al. 2006). Both of the clinical trials demonstrated vari-
ous aspects of hempseed oil as a functional food in humans, while the comparative oils did not. In 
contrast, examples of fortified food would be niacin (vitamin B6) added to cereal grains, sodium 
chloride (table salt) fortified with iodine in the 1920s to prevent the development of goiter, and cow’s 
milk fortified with vitamin D in the early 1930s to aid in absorption of calcium and phosphorus, 
thus preventing rickets. The most useful distinction between nutraceuticals and functional foods is 
simply whether the health-promoting constituents are consumed separately as supplements (nutra-
ceuticals) or as food (functional foods). Given the nutritional qualities of hempseed’s constituents, 
products incorporating hempseed can also legitimately be termed functional foods, although in a 
broad sense they have also been “fortified.” Whether consumed directly or added to food, either 
naturally derived or produced as a cheaper synthetic version of the active natural ingredient, the 
phrase “nutritional supplements” highlights a very important trend that has developed for many 
plants considered to be medicinal. Unlike pharmaceuticals, which are usually potentially toxic

medications that should only be prescribed by a medical professional, nutritional supplements for 
the most part can be purchased from a health food store, herbal practitioner, or independent dis-
tributor or they can simply be consumed in commercial fortified foods. Because they are much less 
expensive than drugs, herbal preparations or extracts, as additions to diet, have been advanced as a 
new, cost-effective health care system.
COSMECEUTICAL PRODUCTS (NUTRITIONAL COSMETICS)
Since the 1990s, hempseed oil has become very significant as a “cosmeceutical” (cosmetic–
nutraceutical), i.e., a body care preparation that promotes the health of skin and allied parts of 
the body because of the topical absorption of biochemicals. These products include bubble baths, 
creams, lip balms, lotions, moisturizers, perfumes, shampoos, and soaps (Figure 8.17). One of the 
most significant developments for the hempseed industry was investment in hemp products by Anita 
and Gordon Rodderick, founders of The Body Shop, a well-known international chain of hair and 
body care retailers. This was a rather courageous and principled move that required overcoming 
legal obstacles related to trace amounts of THC in these products. The Body Shop marketed an 
impressive array of hemp nutraceutical cosmetics in the 1990s (Figure 8.17, top), and this gave the 
emerging hemp industry considerable credibility.
Skin readily absorbs essential fatty acids (EFAs), so that lotions rich in these substances can 
replenish cells damaged by sun and dry air (Wirtshafter 1995). However, EFAs are present in the 
oil as triglycerides, which are poorly absorbed through the skin. On the other hand, it is important 
to keep the dead top layers of skin moist, as this protects the lower layers of dermal tissue from 
FIGURE 8.17 Body care products made with hempseed oil.

the environment. Also, if skin is compromised, and blood vessels are exposed or near the surface, 
then these triglycerides will enter the circulation at these sites, where they are also metabolized 
locally to promote healing. Linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, and steari-
donic acid specifically have several functions related to skin care, once absorbed: they influence 
cell membrane functions, including fluidity, transport of electrolytes, and activity of hormones, 
and they also stimulate cell immunology. These fatty acids applied topically are considered to have 
potential for treating atopic dermatitis (neurodermatosis) and psoriasis (Vogl et al. 2004). Dietary 
hempseed oil, consumed as a functional food, has been shown to improve clinical symptoms in 
patients with atopic dermatitis (Callaway et al. 2005).
INDUSTRIAL (NONEDIBLE) PRODUCTS
The vegetable oils have been classified by “iodine value” as drying (120–200), semidrying 
(100–120), and nondrying (80–100) oils, determined by the degree of saturation of the fatty acids 
present (Raie et al. 1995). The suitability of coating materials prepared from vegetable oil depends 
on the nature and number of double bonds present in the oil’s fatty acids. Linseed oil, a very 
good drying oil, has a very high percentage of linolenic acid. Hempseed oil has been classified 
as a semidrying oil, like soybean oil, and may be more suited for edible rather than industrial oil 
purposes. Nevertheless, hempseed oil has found applications in the past in oil paints, varnishes, 
sealants (wood preservatives), lubricants for machinery, and printing inks (Roulac 1997), although 
petrochemical extracts have made these uses obsolescent and resurrection of such industrial end 
uses is challenging because hempseed oil is currently expensive (De Guzman 2001). Occasionally, 
such products are still found in consumer goods. Larger production volumes and lower prices may 
be possible, in which case hempseed oil may again find industrial uses similar to those of linseed 
(flax), soybean, and sunflower oils, which are presently used in paints, inks, solvents, binders, and 
polymer plastics. Hempseed shows a remarkable range of variation in oil constituents, and selec-
tion for oilseed cultivars with high content of PUFAs and other valued industrial constituents is in 
progress.
In Germany, a laundry detergent manufactured entirely from hempseed oil has been marketed. 
Soap made with hempseed oil is shown in Figure 8.18. Callaway and Pate (2009) noted, “The idea 
of using hempseed oil in a soap or shampoo does have appeal, but without adequate precautions 
taken in the formulation and packaging, these highly unsaturated hydrocarbons will oxidize faster 
than vegetable soaps made from palm or olive oils. Such an oxidized product, containing oil poly-
mers, may leave a residual greasy feeling on the skin, which can be difficult to completely rinse 
away.”

BIODIESEL
Biodiesel, defined as a fuel at least partly made of vegetable oil (Pinto et al. 2005), has been 
touted as an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels. Hempseed oil can be chemically 
converted to function as a biodiesel by transesterification with methanol (Li et al. 2010; Ahmad 
et al. 2011; Ragit et al. 2012; Rehman et al. 2013; Su et al. 2013). Because hempseed oil is highly 
unsaturated, its freezing point is lower than that of saturated oils, for example, palm oil, and 
this is a valuable advantage for biodiesel engines operating in very cold environments (Callaway 
and Pate 2009). In modern times, hempseed oil has been used experimentally as diesel fuel 
(Figure 8.19), but far cheaper vegetable oils are available, and the cost would have to be reduced 
considerably to make hempseed biodiesel economically competitive as a fuel. Moreover, using 
the world’s diminishing croplands to grow fuels instead of vital food resources is a contentious 
ethical issue.
For information on the use of nonseed hemp carbohydrates as a feedstock to produce biofuels, 
see Chapter 15.
THC CONTAMINATION OF OILSEED PRODUCTS
Hemp seeds contain virtually no THC (Mölleken and Husmann 1997), the chief intoxicant chemi-
cal of marijuana. However, THC contamination can result from contact of the seeds with the resin 
secreted by the epidermal glands on the leaves and floral parts, and also by the failure to sift away 
all of the perigonal bracts (which have the highest concentration of THC of any parts of the plant) 
that cover the seeds (Ross et al. 2000). Seed oil prepared from seeds coated with resin may have 
low levels of THC, and the same is true for foods made with the seeds. A study of THC levels on 
hempseed produced in recent years in Europe found that the maximum contamination level was 
12 mg THC/kg or 12 ppm (EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances Used in Animal 
Feed 2011), but levels rarely exceeded 5 mg THC/kg in either seed or oil. The presence of can-
nabinoids is disadvantageous from a regulatory point of view, despite the lack of any scientifically 
demonstrated THC toxicity at even higher levels. The presence of even trace amounts of THC (and 
indeed other cannabinoids) in extracted oilseed products intended for human food has been of 
FIGURE 8.19 An automobile modified to run on vegetable oil and biodiesel. This “hemp car” was a popular 
attraction at hemp fairs in Canada for many years.

Oilseed
considerable concern to some and indeed has been a roadblock to much wider development of foods 
based on cannabis oilseed.
Although much of the Western hemp-growing world uses 0.3% THC in the plant as a maximum con-
centration for authorized cultivation (0.2% in Europe since 2000), regulations in various countries toler-
ate only a much lower level of THC in human food products manufactured from the seeds. Permitted 
levels in hempseed products in different countries range from 10 ppm down to 0.005 ppm. Limits have 
been set in part because of concerns about possible toxicity, where THC “toxicity” is assumed from 
THC’s transient psychoactivity at sufficient dosage (<10 mg). An extensive analysis of literature deal-
ing with the assumed toxicity of hemp is in Orr and Starodub (1999) (see Geiwitz 2001 for a critique).
The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances Used in Animal Feed (2011) examined 
the occurrence of THC accumulation in meat, milk, and eggs resulting from livestock consuming 
hemp (oilseed or oilseed derivatives or the plants used as fodder). At the time of their review, 95% of 
hempseed was used to feed livestock (quite unlike North America, where hempseed is extensively 
used in edible products and cosmetics). Regardless of whether hempseed is consumed directly by 
humans (in processed products) or indirectly as meat, milk, or eggs from livestock fed on hemp-
seed, the critical consideration is how much THC is absorbed by humans. The Federal Institute for 
Risk Assessment in Germany estimated a provisional tolerable adult THC intake of 1–2 μg/kg/day 
as a food contaminant, and from this estimation, a precautionary guidance value for THC in hemp-
seed oil of 5000 μg/kg (5 ppm) was set in 2000, but only in Germany (Matthäus and Brühl 2008).
There has also been some concern about potential interference with drug tests after consum-
ing hempseed foods (Grotenhermen et al. 1998, 2003). Cannabinoids are very lipid soluble and 
accumulate in fatty tissue throughout the body. They are released very slowly and can remain in 
the body for up to a month after the consumption of marijuana. Over a period of a week or so, can-
nabinoid metabolites from hempseed oil can show up in urine (Callaway et al. 1997; Lehmann et al. 
1997). The Drug Enforcement Agency and the Office of National Drug Control Policy of the United 
States raised concerns over tests conducted from 1995 to 1997 that showed that consumption of 
hempseed products available during that period led to interference with drug-testing programs for 
marijuana use. However, at that time, most of the hempseed used for North American food products 
was imported from China, where the typical THC value of field hemp is at least 1%. Federal U.S. 
programs utilize a THC metabolite level of about 50 parts per billion in urine. Leson (2001) and 
Leson et al. (2001) reported that this urinary level was not exceeded by consuming modern hemp-
seed products, provided that THC levels are maintained below 5 ppm in hempseed oil and below 
2 ppm in hulled seeds. The availability of hempseed oil in the 1990s was due to the use of hemp 
varieties with high levels of THC and to collection techniques that allowed THC to accumulate on 
the seeds (Leson et al. 2001). Bosy and Cole (2000) found that by 2000, THC levels in hempseed 
products in North America had been reduced considerably by the industry. Lachenmeier and Walch 
(2005) similarly found that by the early years of the twenty-first century, THC levels in hempseed 
food products in Europe had been strongly lowered, by using varieties with low THC in field tests 
(<0.3%) and by employing more efficient seed cleaning technologies. However, Petrović et al. (2015) 
found THC levels varying from 3 to 70 ppm in hempseed oils in Croatia and implied that, in some 
cases, the oil possibly originated from marijuana strains. Clearly, the use of authorized cultivars is 
required to avoid excessive THC in hempseed products.
AGRONOMY
See Chapter 7 dealing with fiber hemp for information that is pertinent to aspects of the cultiva-
tion of oilseed hemp. The following presentation provides details only when the agronomy of oil-
seed hemp is significantly different. Detailed information on agronomics of the popular cultivar 
FINOLA is available at http://www.finola/fi/.

soil and Fertilization
Vera et al. (2004) observed gradual increases in seed yield of the cultivars Fasamo and FINOLA 
as total nitrogen increased from 40 kg nitrogen (N) ha−1 to 160 kg ha−1. Vera et al. (2010) observed 
a strong increase in seed yield of the oilseed cultivar FINOLA and the dual-purpose cultivar Crag, 
in response to nitrogen fertilization. The test soils employed were not deficient in phosphorus (P), 
but the plants benefitted slightly from P application to the seeds. The test soils employed were defi-
cient in sulfur (S), relative to most grain crop standards, but the plants did not benefit from added 
S. Iványi and Izsáki (2010) examined oil content and protein content of seeds of a dual-purpose 
variety and found maximum seed yield developed at 80 kg N/ha, while additional nitrogen did not 
increase these parameters. It appears that, like fiber hemp, oilseed hemp benefits dramatically by 
supplemental nitrogen, especially in the early development of vegetative growth, and much less dra-
matic effects were observed from the addition of other elements. However, unlike fiber hemp, oil-
seed hemp requires mineral nutrition specifically for flowering and seed production. Berger (1969) 
stated, “During flowering and fruit formation, the demand for potassium and in particular for phos-
phorus is very high.”
temPeratures
Hemp seed production for a given variety requires a warmer climate and a longer season (5 to 6 weeks) 
than the corresponding fiber crop, to allow time for seed maturation (Bócsa and Karus 1998).
Planting
Chapter 13, dealing in part with the cultivation of medical marijuana, points out that a choice can 
be made to maximize floral production (hence high-grade marijuana) on a given plant by giving it 
lots of growing room so that it will be very large, or maximizing production per unit area by grow-
ing many small plants close together. The same considerations apply for seed production. A very 
large plant can produce more than 1 kg of seeds, but growing many small plants closely together can 
produce more seed on a given area.
For seed (grain) production, sowing rates are often 15 to 25 kg/ha, but vary widely, from 1 to 45 kg/
ha, depending on the cultivar and conditions of cultivation. (In the absence of contradictory informa-
tion, the seed supplier’s recommendations regarding planting conditions should be followed.) For a 
cultivar with a 1000-seed-weight of 16 g, planted at 23 kg/ha, the resulting density will be 100–150 
plants/m2 if the germination is high (>80%) (typically about half of the sown seed is lost during emer-
gence and subsequent thinning). Townshend et al. (2012) found that the dual-purpose cultivar Fasamo 
produced the highest oilseed quantities at 150–225 plants/m2 but that oil quality did not appear to vary 
with different plant densities. Based on the cultivars Fasamo and FINOLA (a dedicated oilseed vari-
ety), Vera et al. (2006) found that increasing seeding rate (using rates of 20, 40, 60, and 80 kg/ha, cor-
responding approximately to 49, 78, 105, and 133 plants/m2, respectively) decreased both the density 
and size of weeds (as much as one-third) but increased seed yield (also as much as one-third).
Like fiber hemp, seeds may be planted in rows 15–18 cm apart, but such close planting limits 
interrow removal (by harrowing) of weeds that develop. Nevertheless, Vera et al. (2006) found that 
a row spacing of 36 cm did not change weed problems more than a row spacing of 18 cm. In Europe, 
dual-purpose crops of hemp, grown for both fiber and oilseed, are planted at row spacings from 20 
to 40 cm, 20 seeds/m within the row, considered sufficient to suppress weeds.
Pests
Birds, as discussed in Chapter 3, are the most serious pest problem for production of seeds. Hemp 
grain growers should be aware that flocks of voracious migratory birds are a considerable source 
 

171
Oilseed
of damage to mature hempseed, particularly in small plantations (Figure 8.20). Callaway and Pate 
(2009) noted that “it is not uncommon to observe geese trampling hemp crops at high northern lati-
tudes, to gain access to the nutrient-rich seed.” Not only do birds consume the seed, but they also 
spread diseases, such as dry mold, as they hop from one seed head to another. Stored grain must be 
protected from birds, as they will spend considerable time pecking at seed bags to obtain hempseed, 
in preference to other stored seed.
For weed control with oilseed hemp, which is less densely grown than fiber hemp, mechanical 
removal may be necessary. There are no available herbicides that are effective for weeds in hemp 
that do not also eliminate hemp. Except for possible preplanting applications of herbicides to clear 
fields several weeks before planting, use of any pesticide is strongly discouraged and considered 
unnecessary by the oilseed industry, which is currently concerned with organic production for food 
and pharmaceutical use. Hemp borers (Grapholita dilineana and G. tristrigana) can eat much of 
hemp plants, including the seeds, but in practice this has not been observed to be a significant 
problem.
harvest
A given seed of C. sativa is ripe three to eight weeks following pollination. However, as discussed 
in Chapter 5, photoperiod usually determines flowering time and hence is a natural limitation of 
when and how many seeds are produced at a given latitude. The cultivar FINOLA is autoflowering 
(indifferent to local photoperiod). While long days (daily light longer than 15 hours) inhibit flower 
initiation in most kinds of Cannabis, FINOLA flowers happily in Finland about latitude 60°N, 
where most cultivars will not set seed. Most cultivars of C. sativa, grown in suitable climates, con-
tinue to develop and mature seed over an extend period of time, and plants have both immature and 
ripe seeds when grain harvest occurs. All grain plants have undergone strong selection for simulta-
neous ripening and retention of seeds, to maximize harvest. Oilseed hemp, especially the dual-use 
varieties (employed for both stem fiber as well as seed production), requires breeding to improve 
these features. Retention of seeds on plants is promoted by selection against the basal abscission 
zone of the achenes (so they can’t fall away), and by selection for congestion of the branch-bearing 
achenes (the concentrated bracts and smallest leaves in the infructescences tend to block the seeds 
from falling away).

172
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Industrial hempseed is best harvested when most of the seed is mature. Harvesting is commonly 
done when 70% of the seed is ripe and the seed has a moisture content of about 20% (sometimes 
as much as 30%). Shattering (seed falling off the plants) and bird predation increase if the seed is 
left in the field for a longer period. Swathing (as done for field retting of fiber hemp; Figure 7.17a) is 
not recommended for seed production because drying increases the toughness of the stems, mak-
ing combining more difficult; the seeds do not dry well in the swath; and if rained upon, the seeds 
may start to sprout. Some exceptions are found in very dry cultivation areas, such as Alberta, where 
hemp is grown for seed under irrigation. Swathing also poses a significant risk of contaminating the 
seed with bacteria in the soil, and this is especially true for organic cultivation. Straight combining 
is preferable, and in western Canada, this is normally carried out when the grain has 12%–20% 
moisture, depending on cultivar. Waiting for mature fruiting heads to dry down more increases 
the risks of fibers wrapping around moving combine parts, increasing the risk of fire. Additionally, 
drier seeds are susceptible to cracking, resulting in oxidation and rancidity. However, after harvest, 
Callaway and Pate (2009) recommend that for storage, hempseed be air-dried at low temperatures 
(less than 45°C), to a moisture content of about 9%, employing a moisture meter calibrated for 
hempseed. A variety of harvesting equipment has been employed for hempseed, often using com-
bines modified for the purpose for tall cultivars (Figure 8.21). FINOLA, as a grain crop, does not 
require any combine modifications.
Hemp has often been grown as a dual-purpose crop, i.e., for both fiber and oilseed. In France, 
the principal grower of dual-purpose varieties, the grain is taken off the field first, leaving most of

Oilseed
the stalks for later harvest. Growing short varieties dedicated to grain production eliminates the 
harvesting problems associated with tall hemp varieties (see Chapter 7).
yields
Ideally, hemp seed yield should be based on air-dry weight, with no more than 10% moisture. Hemp 
yield reports are sometimes difficult to interpret and could be exaggerated by as much as 50% when 
moist weights are reported. Most reports of seed yield have not been based on varieties selected for 
oilseed production. Conventional yields in Europe (where hemp has generally not been grown just 
for seed) are as low as 400 kg/ha, and a yield of 1 tonne/ha is considered good for the standard fiber 
varieties. In Canada, good yields are of the order of 1 tonne/ha. Yields for FINOLA in Alberta are 
typically over 2000 kg/ha, with a reported record yield of just over 2000 kg/ha. Maximal yields in 
China are reportedly as high as 1800 kg/ha (Fortenbery and Bennett 2004).
storage
Grains can be stored temporarily at 12% but should be maintained at 8%–10% for long-term stor-
age. Callaway and Pate (2009) recommend that seeds be dried to just below 10% moisture for stor-
age and pressing, taking care that mold growth does not develop.
BREEDING
Almost no modern breeding of Cannabis for oilseed characteristics had taken place by 1995 
(Theimer and Mölleken 1995). One of the earliest efforts to increase oil content was by Bócsa et al. 
(2005) in Hungary. There has been increasing interest in selection for oilseed characteristics since 
then. The first and foremost breeding goal is to decrease the price of hempseed by creating more 
productive cultivars. While the breeding of hemp fiber cultivars has proceeded to the point that only 
slight improvements can be expected in productivity in the future, the genetic potential of hemp as 
an oilseed crop has scarcely been addressed.
Canadian experience with growing hemp commercially for seed has convinced many growers 
that it is better to use a single-purpose cultivar than a dual-purpose cultivar. The recent focus of 
Canadian hemp breeders has been to develop cultivars that are similar to FINOLA, with high seed 
yields, low stature (to avoid diverting the plants’ energy into stalk, as is the case in fiber cultivars), 
early maturation (for the short growing seasons of Canada), and a desirable fatty acid spectrum 
(especially higher levels of SDA and GLA).
Because hempseed food products are considered to have great economic potential, there is con-
siderable pressure on the hemp industry in North America to keep THC levels below 0.3%.
CULTIVARS
To date, Canada has been much more concerned with the oilseed hemp industry than anywhere 
else in the world. However, after industrial hemp was first licensed in 1998, the focus was on fiber 
hemp varieties (almost the only kind available), which proved uneconomical. Today, the indus-
trial hemp industry in Canada is almost completely concerned with oilseed production, using cul-
tivars dedicated for the purpose or dual-purpose varieties. Commonly grown cultivars in Canada 
are Alyssa, Anka, CRS-1, CFX-1, CFX-2, Delores, and (especially) FINOLA. Currently, there are 
relatively few cultivars dedicated to oilseed production, although with increasing world interest in 
developing oilseed hemp, analyses of oil characteristics of cultivars grown for fiber or for both fiber 
and oilseed have been conducted, and these studies provide information on germplasm suitable for 
development of additional dedicated oilseed cultivars. Vogl et al. (2004) surveyed oilseed qualities 
of some European cultivars (mostly grown for fiber). Small and Marcus (2000) examined oilseed 
 

174

characteristics of 62 accessions. Chen et al. (2010) surveyed the qualitative and quantitative oilseed 
aspects of eight hemp cultivars grown in various regions of China. Anwar et al. (2006) surveyed oil 
characteristics of indigenous hemp found in various regions of Pakistan. Table 17.3 provides infor-
mation on hemp cultivars, including those used primarily for producing oilseed.
THE POTENTIAL USE OF OILSEED CULTIVARS 
TO PRODUCE CBD AND “HIGHLESS MARIJUANA”
As documented in Chapters 11 and 13, the resin of C. sativa is usually dominated by CBD, THC, or 
both. While most contemporary medicinal and recreational strains are predominantly dedicated to 
THC, CBD has considerable medicinal potential, indeed exceeding the likely value of THC. Since 
the resin of hemp cultivars is dominated by CBD relative to THC, it is obvious that these varieties 
are a potential source of this invaluable cannabinoid. Because oilseed cultivars produce more flow-
ers than fiber cultivars, and the principal source of resin is from the flowering tops of C. sativa, oil-
seed cultivars are a much more promising source of CBD. Just as oilseed cultivars that are short and 
compact represent the most efficient architectural strategy for maximizing seed production, this is 
also precisely the way to maximize floral production and resin on a given acreage. However, indus-
trial cultivars of C. sativa have not been selected for high resin production. Indica type marijuana, 
discussed in Chapter 12, which has been selected for high resin production in individual plants and 
on a given acreage, usually produces considerable amounts of CBD but also produces considerable 
THC, which is still a barrier at present to most authorized industrial hemp production.
To produce CBD as an extract, entire plants can be employed, including the foliage. For medicinal 
purposes, there is currently somewhat of a demand for so-called “highless marijuana”—a nonpsy-
chotropic product that is high in CBD but low in THC, which can be smoked. (See the discussion of 
CBD in Chapter 13 for additional information on highless marijuana.) As discussed in Chapter 13, 
for biomedical safety reasons, it is far more preferable to imbibe vaporized cannabis (supplied as 
solvent extracts) than to smoke marijuana (as an herbal) and still more preferable to ingest prepara-
tions orally. Nevertheless, to meet a demand for highless marijuana in the form of “buds” (congested 
flowering heads without seeds; see Chapter 12), plants of the architecture of some modern oilseed 
cultivars are ideal.
The use of industrial hemp for the production of CBD has not received much consideration yet, 
although there is commercial interest in using field-grown plants for this purpose. Since the hemp 
industry is already growing plants outdoors under license, with relatively small security require-
ments, why shouldn’t it also be permitted to harvest the CBD or even produce “highless marijuana”? 
The industry is not allowed to do so at the moment in most countries, and no doubt, the very concept 
of highless marijuana will be so enigmatic to many that authorizing such production is likely to 
meet opposition, or at least slow acceptance.
ECONOMIC STATUS
Hempseed development has been retarded because of its image problem as a relative of marijuana, 
coupled with trace amounts of THC in the oil, but these concerns have now been mostly overcome. 
The dietary advantages and attractive taste of hempseed and hempseed oil have led to their wide-
spread use in processed food products, although hempseed is not yet competitive as a commodity 
with the major edible vegetable oils. There has also been minor success in developing the use of 
hempseed oil in nutritional cosmetics and hempseed extracts as dietary supplements. Hempseed oil 
is unsuitable as a frying oil but has good potential for penetrating the salad oil market. Hempseed 
also has potential as animal feed (especially for both livestock and companion animals). The tra-
ditional use of hempseed oil to manufacture industrial products such as paints and lubricants is 
obsolete but could be resurrected if economic factors allow and breeding produces cultivars that 
produce high levels of desired oilseed components.
 

175
Oilseed
The European Union has historically concentrated on developing Cannabis as a fiber crop, much 
more than as an oilseed crop, but many in Europe are realizing that the success of fiber develop-
ment has been due primarily to subsidization. Hempseed development in the EU has lagged behind 
the progress in Canada, which has not provided subsidies to hemp. Canada has concentrated on the 
development of the hempseed industry, with little attention to hemp fiber. This is consistent with 
Canada’s specialization on production and processing of the major temperate region oilseeds, such 
as Canola (rapeseed), soybean, sunflower, mustard, safflower, and flaxseed, while Canada lacks a 
fiber crop industry. Because of the extensive development of oilseeds in Canada, there is extensive 
capacity to produce high-quality cold-pressed hemp oil. Canada has made great advances in the 
growing, harvesting, and processing of hempseed during the last decade and has become the world 
leader in providing raw materials and products for the natural foods, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics 
industries. Whereas China used to supply most of the hempseed used for food in North America, 
Canadian-grown seeds have taken over most of this market. The United States will likely follow 
Canada’s dedication to oilseed hemp as industrial hemp becomes legalized there.
China, the world leader in production of hempseed, can produce it cheaply, but imported seed 
must be sterilized, thus creating delays, adding costs, and lowering grain quality. Seed that has been 
sterilized tends to go rancid quickly, and so it is imperative that fresh seed be available, at least for 
human foods. Accordingly, domestic production is a great advantage. Another extremely significant 
advantage that domestic producers have over foreign sources is certified organic production, which 
is in demand.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE NEEDS
The economic prospects for continued development of C. sativa as an oilseed crop are much better 
than for its continued development as a fiber crop, at least in industrialized countries. As noted in 
Chapter 14, there are considerable prospects for greatly expanded production of medicinal mari-
juana, and very likely, this will be a stimulus to the industrial hemp industry, as the stigma of mari-
juana continues to decrease with education and changing demographics.
Creation and marketing of new hempseed products have been increasing for the last two decades. 
The key need is the development of high-yielding cultivars to increase the competiveness of hemp-
seed in relation to other oilseeds.
The cultivation of dual-purpose crops (fiber and oilseed) is problematical for oilseed production. 
The profitability of hemp straw is limited at present, while that of the seeds is much higher, so it 
seems preferable to concentrate on oilseed production. Because fiber hemp and oilseed are best 
produced as dedicated crops, there is a measure of competition between them. China’s supremacy 
in the production of high-quality hemp textiles at low prices will be very difficult to match in the 
Western world, although as noted in Chapter 7, Europe has pioneered in the development of hemp 
applications that do not require the traditional production of very high-quality fiber and has created 
new technologies and machinery for this purpose. Nevertheless, the future of hemp fiber remains 
challenging. Europe has shown only limited interest until very recently in developing oilseed hemp, 
but with the growing realization that fiber hemp has limited growth potential, this is changing. A 
tradition of concentrating on profitable oilseed products is already well established in Canada, in 
part because domestic production of oilseeds can be carried out using oilseed production and pro-
cessing technology that is already available.
The present productivity of oilseed hemp—about 1 tonne/ha under good conditions, occasion-
ally 1.5 to 2 tonnes/ha, is not yet sufficient for the crop to become competitive with major oilseeds. 
An average productivity of at least 2 tonnes/ha will be necessary to transform hempseed into a 
major oilseed, a breeding goal that is achievable. At present, losses of 30% of the seed yields are not 
uncommon, so that improvements in harvesting technology should also contribute to higher yields. 
Hemp food products cannot escape their niche market status until the price of hempseed rivals that 
of other oilseeds, particularly rapeseed, flax, and sunflower (Marcus and Small 2002).

After increasing yield per hectare, a second breeding goal is for larger seeds, as these are more 
easily shelled (hulled). A third goal could be breeding for both large seeds and thin, easily removed 
shells, so that the fresh seeds could be consumed directly as a snack food. Fourth is breeding for 
specific seed components. Notable objectives are increasing the health-promoting GLA, improving 
the amino acid spectrum of the protein, and increasing the antioxidant level, which would not only 
have health benefits but could increase the shelf life of hemp oil and foods.
It may be noted that while breeding for large seeds could be beneficial for market and processing 
goals, it would add to the cost of planting seeds, since a heavier weight of seeds would be required 
to achieve a given plant density (although larger seeds are beneficial in tending to survive better and 
to grow faster initially). While larger seeds may be beneficial for oilseed cultivars, smaller seeds 
may save money at planting time for fiber hemp farmers.
Watson and Clarke (1997) suggested that breeding for cultivars with very small seeds could 
result in such seeds being useful for baking. This would seem analogous with the very small seeds 
of opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.), widely employed in cuisine. However, the industry can 
simply shred large hemp seeds to produce small particles the size of poppy seeds.
The stringent security regulations for cultivating hemp in most Western countries significantly 
increases the cost of production and puts the crop at a unique disadvantage. In particular, the federal 
government of the United States, which still bans commercial production of hemp, is in the curious 
position of allowing importation of large amounts of hempseed products while prohibiting its own 
farmers from growing the crop. Given the enormous ingenuity and capacities of the American agri-
cultural sector, one can predict that oilseed hemp would experience a considerable leap in popular-
ity should the United States join the fraternity of nations now producing the crop.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• The paintings of Rembrandt (1606–1669), Vincent Van Gogh (1853–1890), and Thomas 
Gainsborough (1727–1788) were prepared primarily on hemp canvas, often with paints 
based on hempseed oil.
• Reminiscent of the practice of throwing rice at the wedding couple (symbolic of encourag-
ing fertility), the wedding rituals of south Slavic regions included showering the bride with 
hempseed when she entered her new home.
• In the Middle Ages of Europe, until the twentieth century, women in England tried to 
visualize their future husbands by scattering hemp seeds in a garden or churchyard on 
Midsummer’s Eve, while chanting:
 
Hempseed I set,
 
Hempseed I sow
 
The man that is my true love
 
Come after me now.
• Benet (1975) provided the following account of how girls in Ukraine wishing to advance 
the date of their marriage carried hemp seeds in their belts, mounted a heap of seeds, and 
recited:
 
Andrei Andrei,
 
I plant the hemp seed on you.
 
Will God let me know
 
With whom I will sleep?
 
 
The girls subsequently removed their shirts and spit water on the seeds to protect them 
from being eaten by birds. Finally, they ran around the house naked three times.
• In Ireland, young ladies sowed hemp seed during Halloween in the belief that if they 
looked behind them while sowing, they would see an image of their future husbands.
• In Poland and Lithuania, a soup made from hemp seeds called semieniatka was eaten 
ritually on Christmas Eve. It was believed that hemp soup offerings should be left for the

departed, as dead relatives would visit every Christmas Eve. A similar meal was eaten in 
Latvia and Ukraine in the celebration of Three Kings’ Day (Benet 1975).
• In Latvia, hemp seed is traditionally included in festival foods eaten during St. John’s Day, 
June 21.
• According to an old European belief, if chickens are fed hemp seeds on Christmas Eve, 
they will lay all year round.
• The first diesel engine was designed to run on vegetable oils, one of which was hemp oil.
• In 1941, Henry Ford (1863–1947) built a car body from a mixture of resins and plants including 
hemp and demonstrated that it could run on fuel made from plants, including hemp biodiesel.
• Hemp seed is legally available to most consumers in North America only after it has been 
steam-sterilized, to prevent the seeds being used to grow plants. Unfortunately, this dena-
tures the protective antioxidants and results in the oil in the seeds quickly going rancid. 
Robert F. Stroud, the “Birdman of Alcatraz” (played by Burt Lancaster in the film of the 
same name), became an expert on birds during the long years he avoided execution on 
California’s death row. (Stroud, shown in Figure 8.22, a notoriously dangerous psychopath 
who had murdered two men, died in prison after spending 54 years in solitary confine-
ment.) His authoritative 1939 book Diseases of Birds expressed his frustration with the fact 
that the seeds he had to use had been sterilized:
 
“I want to make it perfectly clear right now that anything said in these pages about 
the virtues of hemp seed applies to fresh, unsterilized hempseed—most assuredly not 
to the rancid trash now on the market… Because the seed is rich in the reproductive 
vitamin, an unlimited supply of it should be kept before the hens making eggs to insure 
a high percentage of hatchability… The oil of hemp seed becomes rancid very quickly 
and what was once a valuable food becomes deadly poison. For this reason, hemp seed 
must always be used with care.”
• There are trace amounts of THC, the intoxicating component of marijuana, in hempseed 
oil and sometimes in the meal obtained from hemp seeds, and these may appear in food 
products made from them. Some American lawyers have argued, on behalf of clients who 
had positive drug test results for marijuana, that this was due to having consumed hemp-
seed products. Accordingly, U.S. military forces have been forbidden from eating such 
FIGURE 8.22 Robert Stroud, the “Birdman of Alcatraz,” who extolled the virtues of hempseed as a bird-
feed. (U.S. government, public domain photo.)

products. In fact, modern methods of preparing hempseed products now ensures that only 
insignificant levels of THC are present, which are too small to produce a positive test with 
contemporary drug tests.
• Movie actor Woody Harrelson, a supporter of all things related to cannabis, prepared a 
documentary titled Go Further, which chronicled his adventures along the West Coast 
aboard a bus fuelled by hempseed oil.
• Anka, Carmen, and Deni were the first registered varieties of hemp bred in North America. 
They were created by the late Canadian breeder Peter Dragla. Anka was named in honor of 
his wife, Carmen for his daughter, and Deni after the daughter of Woody Harrelson, who 
supported Dragla’s research.

9 Essential Oil
INTRODUCTION TO ESSENTIAL OIL
Essential oil should not be confused with vegetable oil. “Essential oils” (also known as volatile oils 
and ethereal oils) are said to be “nonfixed” (meaning that they can evaporate quickly), while veg-
etable oils are “fixed” (meaning that they are relatively stable). The edible vegetable oil of Cannabis 
sativa, i.e., “hempseed oil” from the seeds, was discussed in Chapter 8. The essential oil of C. sativa 
should also not be confused with “hashish oil,” i.e., solvent extracts rich in cannabinoids, employed 
as a highly concentrated form of marijuana, discussed in Chapter 12. The phrase “hemp oil” should 
be avoided because it could refer either to vegetable oil or essential oil. The phrase “cannabis oil” 
could refer to either of these or to hash oil and so is particularly ambiguous.
Essential oil is an indistinct category of compounds synthesized primarily as secondary metab-
olites in plants. Essential oil is responsible for scent in numerous plants (Baser and Buchbauer 
2010; Figure 9.1). Approximately 3000 essential oils have been described, of which about 10% have 
commercial importance in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceuticals (FAO 1995). The composition 
of essential oils can vary considerably within a given species, and as noted in this chapter, this is 
particularly true for C. sativa.
Essential oils are complex mixtures of organic (hydrocarbon) chemicals and particularly 
include terpenes and oxygenated compounds such as alcohols, esters, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, 
lactones, phenols, and phenol ethers (Guenther 1972). Terpenes typically dominate essential oils. 
Over 30,000 have been chemically characterized from the plant world, a larger number than for 
any other class of natural plant products (Dewick 2002). Terpenes are made up of units of isoprene: 
CH2=C(–CH3)–CH=CH2. Monoterpenes consist of two isoprene units, sesquiterpenes consist of 
three. “Terpenoids” are related compounds, although the term is often used as a synonym of ter-
penes. Many terpenes are extremely odoriferous, detectable by smell at very low concentrations. 
According to Casano et al. (2011), “terpenes are strongly inherited and little influenced by envi-
ronmental factors.”
THE NATURE OF CANNABIS ESSENTIAL OIL
The characteristic odors of Cannabis plants are due to their essential oil. Cannabis essential oil 
is a mixture of volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other terpenoid-
like compounds. About 140 terpenoids are known in C. sativa (Giese et al. 2015), although none 
is unique to just this species. The two most common terpenes in the plant world are alpha-pinene 
and limonene, respectively (Gardner 2011), and both are present in the essential oil of C. sativa. 
Other common terpenes of Cannabis include myrcene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, caryophyl-
lene oxide, nerolidol, and phytol. Some terpenes in Cannabis are quite pleasant in odor: limo-
nene is fruity (lemons are rich in this chemical), linalool has a rather sweet smell. Mediavilla 
and Steinemann (1997) found that Cannabis essential oils with high sesquiterpene concentra-
tions smelled bad, while oils with high monoterpene percentages (but a low alpha-humulene or 
caryophyllene oxide concentration) had pleasant smells. Depending on biotype, monoterpenes 
represent 48%–92% of the volatile terpenes and sesquiterpenes represent 5%–49% (Mediavilla 
and Steinemann 1997). Monoterpenoids usually make up most of the essential oil of Cannabis 
(Hendriks et al. 1975; Lemberkovics et al. 1981). The aroma of C. sativa is particularly due to the 
monoterpenes pinene and limonene, which frequently comprise over 75% of the volatiles (Hood 
et al. 1973) and often dominate “headspace” odor near the plant. However, the monoterpenes 

180
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
evaporate relatively faster than other components, so the composition of essential oil actually in 
the harvested plant (and capable of being extracted) may differ from the volatiles released around 
the fresh plant. Consequently, the odor of the living plant is not necessarily indicative of the rela-
tive composition of the plant’s essential oil (Ross and ElSohly 1996) or of the odor of the dried 
plant.
The composition of essential oils has been found to vary considerably among strains and culti-
vars of C. sativa (Fournier and Paris 1978; Osman et al. 1985; Mediavilla and Steinemann 1997; 
Novak and Franz 2003; Hillig 2004a; Bertoli et al. 2010; Fischedick et al. 2010; Casano et al. 2011). 
Elzinga et al. (2015) were unable to detect clear differences in terpene composition between sativa 
type and indica type marijuana strains. However, as noted later, marijuana strains tend to have 
pleasanter odors than hemp cultivars.
The terpenes of Cannabis are manufactured in the same epidermal glands (secretory glan-
dular trichomes) in which the cannabinoids of Cannabis (discussed in Chapter 11) are produced 
(Malingré et al. 1975; Fournier and Paris 1978; Meier and Mediavilla 1998). The cannabinoids and 
terpenoids make up the resinous secretion of the glands. Indeed, the cannabinoids and terpenoids 
have a parental biosynthetic precursor in common (pyrophosphate). Unlike the terpenes, the can-
nabinoids are odorless (Clarke and Watson 2002). Terpenes may account for about 1% of marijuana 
but can comprise as much as 10% of the secretory glands (Gardner 2011).
Rothschild et al. (2005) identified volatile terpenes from Cannabis pollen. Pollen does not have 
secretory glands. It is possible that the cells of pollen grains can synthesize terpenes, but the report 
could be based on contamination from the anther glands. (Similarly, Paris et al. 1975 identified can-
nabinoids in pollen, which could also have resulted from contamination.)
As discussed in Chapter 11, there is controversial evidence for trace amounts of cannabinoid 
production outside of the epidermal glands (in laticifers and tissue cultures), and whether the same 
is true for terpenes remains to be clarified.

pleasant odors. This public domain painting, entitled “Smell,” was prepared about 1617 by Jan Brueghel the 
Elder and is housed in the Museo del Prado. Photo credit: The Yorck Project.

Essential Oil
POSSIBLE PLANT-PROTECTIVE FUNCTIONS 
OF THE ESSENTIAL OIL OF CANNABIS
A considerable variety of chemical constituents of Cannabis, including the cannabinoids, are known 
to be toxic to many organisms (e.g., Radwan et al. 2008, 2009). The essential oil also appears to 
contain compounds toxic to a wide variety of microbial and animal species that attack plants. What 
adaptive significance the essential oil has for wild plants of C. sativa is unclear, although terpenes 
such as those in Cannabis are repellent to some insects (Thomas et al. 2000), are antimicrobial 
(Fournier et al. 1978; Novak et al. 2001; Nissen et al. 2009), and are antifungal, antiviral, and anti-
parasitic (Paduch et al. 2007). The terpenes of C. sativa might also contribute to its capacity to repel 
competing plants (see discussion of allelopathy in Chapter 3).
It has been suggested that the more fragrant terpenes like limonene and pinene function par-
ticularly well against insects preying on the floral parts, while the relatively bitter sesquiterpenes 
in the foliage act against grazing animals (Langenheim 1994). Beta-caryophyllene is usually the 
predominant sesquiterpenoid of C. sativa (Mediavilla and Steinemann 1997), and in addition to 
repelling insects, it attracts predatory green lacewings, reinforcing protection against insect herbi-
vores (Russo 2011a). As pointed out by Potter (2009), “The very different balance of monoterpenes 
in the sessile trichomes on the foliage and the predominantly capitate stalked trichomes on floral 
tissues is supporting evidence that these trichomes have different functions. Both types contain bit-
ter sesquiterpenes which can act as anti-feedant repellents. The increased monoterpene content of 
capitate stalked trichomes would be expected to lower the viscosity of the contents, thereby making 
it more able for them to ensnare insects… The monoterpenes are more volatile, and being hydropho-
bic they are highly persistent in the atmosphere. Insect olfactory systems are devoid of the mucous 
membranes found in mammals, and they are especially sensitive to such lypophylic chemicals. 
Monoterpenes are thereby detected by insects at considerable distances from the plant. In many 
cases these monoterpenes are repellent to insects (e.g., α-pinene and ants) those insects apparently 
misidentifying the monoterpene as an alarm pheromone.”
VALUE OF CANNABIS TERPENOIDS AS COMMERCIAL REPELLENTS
Nerio et al. (2010) reviewed the repellent value of essential oils in general to control insects and 
other invertebrates harmful as pathogens affecting human and livestock health, and damaging 
materials of value to humans, especially stored food. They noted that synthetic chemicals currently 
dominate the repellent market, but natural plant extracts have potential to provide repellents that 
are safer for humans and the environment. For additional observations, see the discussion of natural 
pesticides in Chapter 10.
MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TERPENES IN CANNABIS
The common terpenes in Cannabis are present in many other plants. These terpenes are known 
to have a variety of medicinal effects (Table 9.1): several are anti-inflammatory or psychologi-
cally soothing, and some have specific therapeutic applications for human illnesses and disorders 
(Buchbauer 2010).
As discussed in Chapter 12, the sedative terpene myrcene may be responsible for “couchlock,” 
a state of extreme lethargy reputedly associated with indica type marijuana strains. Beta-myrcene 
is the predominant monoterpene in C. sativa (in both marijuana strains and industrial cultivars). 
Piomelli and Russo (2016) stated: “The sedation of the so-called indica strains is falsely attributed 
to CBD content when, in fact, CBD is stimulating in low and moderate doses! Rather, sedation 
in most common Cannabis strains is attributable to their myrcene content, a monoterpene with a 
strongly sedative couch-lock effect that resembles a narcotic. In contrast, a high limonene content 
(common to citrus peels) will be uplifting on mood, while the presence of the relatively rare terpene 
 

182
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
in Cannabis, alpha-pinene, can effectively reduce or eliminate the short-term memory impairment 
classically induced by THC.”
Ross and ElSohly (1996) found that when plant material was stored in closed paper bags for 
three months, about half of the beta-myrcene evaporated away, indicating that the psychological 
properties of marijuana as influenced by terpenes may change with storage conditions and time.
Of particular interest is evidence of interaction of the natural terpenoids and cannabinoids in 
marijuana, which may be therapeutic (McPartland and Russo 2001; Russo 2011a). Races of C. sativa 
have been selected which are high in particular terpenes (Gardner 2011), and these might be of value 
should particular cannabinoid-terpene combinations prove to be of significant medical application. 
Whether simply combining cannabinoid and terpenoid extracts would be more efficient than breed-
ing biotypes that naturally combine certain cannabinoids and terpenes will need to be considered, 
since far cheaper sources of terpenes are available than C. sativa.
WHY ELIMINATING TERPENES BY IRRADIATING 
MEDICAL MARIJUANA MAY BE HARMFUL
Until recently, there has been only one official national supplier of medical marijuana in Canada, 
and as of the writing of this book, the federal government of the United States and the government 
of the Netherlands also have just one national supplier. The herbal marijuana supplied has been 
subjected to gamma radiation before being released to patients. The objective is to ensure micro-
biological safety by sterilizing any potentially toxic microorganisms that are present, which are of 
concern because many patients are immune-compromised and especially susceptible to infection 
(Chapter 13). However, an unintended result is the reduction of terpenes, especially monoterpenes, 
which are especially sensitive to irradiation (Fan and Gates 2001). Just as irradiated food sometimes 
has a flat or cooked aroma that consumers find objectionable, so patients who are familiar with 
marijuana sometimes find the dearomatized nature of irradiated medical marijuana so objectionable 
that they turn to the black market. Moreover, as pointed out previously, there is reason to believe that 
the terpenes normally in marijuana contribute to its medical efficacy, so that irradiated marijuana 
may in fact be less healthy. See Chapter 14 for additional information on the wisdom of irradiating 
medical marijuana.
EVOLUTION OF ESSENTIAL OIL IN DOMESTICATED CANNABIS
Some wild populations of C. sativa produce very nauseous smells (especially noticeable in closed 
spaces), raising the possibility that humans have selected plants with relatively pleasant odor due to

Essential Oil
particular essential oil components. The odor of fiber strains is quite divorced from the quality and 
quantity of fiber in the stem (the fiber has no particular smell), but the odor of harvested marijuana is 
unavoidable and so has been more susceptible to selection. It is plausible that in the past, marijuana 
land races with pleasant odors were selected more often than was the case for fiber strains. Marijuana 
strains tend to be more attractive in odor than fiber strains, and many of the popularly marketed 
marijuana strains have relatively pleasing odors. Humans appreciate fragrance for aesthetic rea-
sons, and indeed, in former times, fragrant resins were often employed in religious sacraments. An 
attractive fragrance would have reinforced the spiritual value of intoxicating forms of cannabis and 
so likely would have been selected. Clarke and Merlin (2013) observed that “Pioneering marijuana 
breeders continued selecting primarily for strong potency (high Δ9-THC content), followed by more 
aesthetic considerations of flavor, aroma, and color. Modifying adjectives such as ‘minty,’ ‘floral,’ 
‘spicy,’ ‘fruity,’ ‘sweet,’ ‘purple,’ ‘golden,’ or ‘red’ were often associated with selected varieties.” 
Upton et al. (2013) noted in regard to marijuana that “the aromas as described in modern advertising 
include: peculiar, narcotic, strong, sweet to sour, fruity to pungent, agreeable, aromatic, fresh and 
sweet, euphoric, spicy, citrusy, musty, skunky, acrid, juniper, floral, sour, diesel, vanilla, complex, 
blueberry, pineapple, perfumed, piney, sandalwood, mango, skunky-cheese, and more.” General 
adjectives such as complex, fresh, perfumed, and pungent that are applied to modern strains of 
marijuana can be difficult to interpret, in contrast to more specific comparative terms such as blue-
berry, cheesy, citrus, juniper, mango, pineapple, piney, sandalwood, and vanilla.
An unpleasant odor often does not disqualify material from being consumed by humans. The 
odor of some common marijuana strains is quite objectionable (note the popular strain Skunk). 
Moreover, it is apparent that some strains with a foul smell are appreciated by many. Some currently 
popular strains are described by terms such as acrid, diesel, musty, peculiar, and sour. Bouquet 
(1950) noted, “Ganja [marijuana] has a pronounced fetid smell, much appreciated by addicts.” It 
should be noted that judgment of the relative attractiveness of odor depends appreciably on one’s 
upbringing. The smells of ethnic foods that have become familiar in childhood may seem to be very 
attractive to those habituated to them, but quite unattractive to others.
The possibility that the terpenes present in the essential oil modify the physiological effects 
of the cannabinoids is discussed in Chapter 13. If so, it is possible that unconscious selection for 
medically effective terpene profiles has been significant in the biochemical evolution of Cannabis 
marijuana strains.
ODOR AND OTHER ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITIES OF MARIJUANA
Industries that offer products that are consumed by mouth, like marijuana, are very concerned about 
organoleptic preferences (taste, odor, and texture) of their offerings since these are critical criteria 
by which consumers judge acceptability. For marijuana, probably odor (which is interconnected 
with taste) is the only organoleptic factor of interest, although the abrasiveness of the foliage, caused 
by the presence of cystolith hairs, may also be significant since there has been some consumption 
by mouth.
Odor or “aroma” (a combination of smell and taste) is quite subjective, and characterizing 
C. sativa in these respects is problematical. The odor of C. sativa has been described by a variety of 
divergent terms in the literature, such as agreeable, disagreeable, strong, aromatic, heavy, and odd. 
Intoxicating plants have been alleged to have smells that are “narcotic” and “euphoric,” although 
clearly this requires imagination.
The taste of marijuana is unpleasant—typically bitter, acrid, and resinous—and the mouth feel 
is also unpleasant—crunchy and sticky. In southern Asia, “bhang” is a low-intoxicant preparation 
of Cannabis leaves, typically combined with milk products (THC is soluble in fat) and sometimes 
eaten by lower classes, but the taste (as in all marijuana edibles) is masked by more pleasant ingre-
dients. In the illicit drug counterculture/underground trade, hundreds of strains of C. sativa are 
offered, and many of these have names suggesting either or both odor and taste (e.g., Lemon-Lime 
 

184
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Kush, California Orange Bud, and Fruity Juice). However, these differ primarily in olfactory, not 
taste qualities, likely mostly because of different profiles of the terpenes that are present. Although 
the terpenes are volatile, some remain in the resin glands unless they are crushed.
ODOR HAS BECOME A KEY SELLING CRITERION FOR MARIJUANA
Plants are capable of producing an enormous range of odors due to variation of essential oil content. 
The “scented-leaved” or “fragrant-leaved” geraniums (species of Pelargonium) are a mixed group 
of odoriferous species, including several dozen used for culinary purposes. The species smell like 
fruits (apricot, apple, peach, and strawberry), citrus (lemon, lime, and orange), “nuts” (coconut and 
filbert), spices (allspice, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg), mint, pine, camphor, and especially roses 
(Small 2006). It should be noted that the perception of smell is at least somewhat unique to individu-
als (as noted previously, early experiences often determine lifelong preferences), and one person’s 
apricot-scented plant may be another’s sour milk.
Cannabis also presents a wide range of odors. The hundreds of marijuana strains currently mar-
keted differ in THC content, the chief determinant of psychological effect, so this is the main basis 
on which the product is purchased. However, many consumers have acquired the conviction that 
strong smell is an indicator of potency, and it is now common practice among marijuana users to 
judge the quality of dried cannabis or hashish at least partly by intensity of smell. Accordingly, 
the terpene content of marijuana has become a critical quality concern for both illicit dealers and 
authorized sellers.
As noted previously, strains of Cannabis may have been selected with particular terpene profiles 
in combination with particular cannabinoids, for medical value, but the possibility exists of simply 
combining cannabinoids with given terpenes from commercial (non-Cannabis) sources. Indeed, in 
theory, a variety of chemicals with desired odors or medicinal properties could simply be added 
to marijuana. Regulations in particular jurisdictions may prevent adding materials to medicinal 
marijuana, but in the long-term, it would seem that if genuine medical benefit is gained from adding 
given terpenes to marijuana, there should not be an objection. If it also is established that no harm 
results from adding terpenes to marijuana simply for attractive aroma (in the same manner that 
lemon and pine aromas are widely added to detergents), then one can anticipate that “flavored” or 
“aromatized” marijuana will become popular. Such a practice is reminiscent of the tobacco indus-
try’s offerings of scented and flavored products.
THE IMPORTANCE OF TERPENE ODOR FOR OILSEED CANNABIS
“Fresh, cold-pressed hempseed oil from good quality seed typically offers a delicious combination 
of citrus, mint and pepper flavors from the oil” (Callaway and Pate 2009). Volatile terpenes are 
primarily responsible for the delicate flavors of the oil (Mediavilla and Steinemann 1997), and it is 
necessary to control temperature and drying regime carefully to preserve the aroma (Callaway and 
Pate 2009).
ODOR DETECTION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
Facetiously, it may be pointed out that the odor of marijuana has affected human evolution, since 
the distinct smell has widely attracted law enforcement officers, resulting in the incarceration of 
millions, reducing their Darwinian fitness (potential for leaving progeny). Police have become quite 
expert in recognizing the odor of marijuana and have even used devices to aid in their evaluation 
of the strength of the odor and to identify faint odors (note the “smelloscope” or “smellometer” 
shown in Figure 9.2, right). Caryophyllene oxide, a minor odoriferous component of marijuana, has 
been used to train police “sniffer dogs” (Figures 9.2, left, and 9.3) to detect marijuana (Martin et al. 
1961; Nigam et al. 1965). Caryophyllene oxide is present in the volatile oil of other plants, such as 
 

185
Essential Oil
mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.) and clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & L.M. Perry), but 
almost always the dogs alert to marijuana and not to flavoring herbs and spices.
In many jurisdictions, detection of the smell of marijuana is sufficient justification to permit 
police to inspect a person, vehicle, or premise. In the United States, the Fourth Amendment of the 
U.S. Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure, so the accuracy of judg-
ment of odor as a guide to the presence of marijuana has been extensively examined in courts, but 
less so by scientists. A rather preliminary review by Doty et al. (2004) suggested that many common 
plants and some animals have scents identical to marijuana, so that claims by officers of smelling 
marijuana are uncertain. The fact is, however, that in Western countries, relatively few people trans-
porting highly odoriferous material are likely to be carrying anything but marijuana. In a study of 
Alaskan marijuana police cases involving possible marijuana in buildings, Myrstol and Brandeis 
(2012) concluded, “Detection of marijuana odors was not found to be a good predictor of whether 
or not a search would result in the discovery of less than one ounce of marijuana… Detection of

marijuana odors was found to be significantly associated with the discovery of relatively ‘large’ 
amounts of marijuana—that is, quantities of four ounces or more, as well as 25 or more plants.” As 
one would expect given the olfactory skills of dogs, canine detection is more accurate than human 
detection but is not infallible. “Limited work has been published on canine and human detection 
of marijuana odor, yielding mixed results and high variability” (Rice and Koziel 2015). It has been 
shown that handler belief that marijuana is present increases the likelihood that dogs will detect it 
(Lit et al. 2011).
AGRONOMIC PRODUCTION
Commercial preparations of the essential oil, often called “Cannabis flower essential oil” and “hemp 
essential oil,” have been prepared from the female or monoecious inflorescences and/or the younger 
foliage. Mediavilla and Steinemann (1997) observed very considerable variation of pleasantness of 
both fiber cultivars and marijuana strains. However, marijuana strains tend to be more attractive in 
odor than fiber hemp, although the essential oil of most hemp cultivars tends to have considerable 
myrcene, which is pleasant in odor and is often used in the perfume industry. Marijuana strains 
produce much higher numbers of flowers than fiber strains, and because the (female) floral parts 
provide most of the essential oil, marijuana strains are naturally adapted to essential oil production. 
Switzerland has permitted strains with higher THC content to be grown than is allowed in most 
other countries, giving the nation an advantage with respect to the essential oil market. Accordingly, 
Switzerland has been a center for the production of essential oil of C. sativa for the commercial 
market. Nevertheless, essential oil in the marketplace has been produced from low-THC Cannabis, 
for example, in France and Canada.
Parameters affecting the production of essential oil have not been carefully examined. Extraction 
of the essential oil by steam distillation of fresh plants has a yield of only 0.05%–0.29%, depending on 
growth, harvest, and drying conditions (Upton et al. 2013). Essential oil is maximized under the same 
conditions that THC is maximized, since both are produced primarily by glandular hairs. However, 
growing exclusively female plants to prevent seed formation has apparently not been practiced for 
essential oil production, although pollination prevention in greenhouse experiments showed signifi-
cantly higher essential oil yield (Mediavilla 1998). Mediavilla (1998) reported that “Highest yield of 
essential oils was gained when about 50% of the seeds had reached maturity. The ideal harvest time 
for best quality (scent scores) was… between female flowering and seed maturity. Unfortunately 
the yield and the quality never [are both] highest at the same time. Therefore the optimal harvest 
time depends on whether the farmer or his customer is more interested in yield or quality. The time 
interval when both yield and quality are high is rather small.” Because essential oil is water soluble, 
rain and high humidity can deteriorate production (Mediavilla 1998). This is a common problem 
for numerous essential oil crops but is avoided by growing in dry environments. Growing C. sativa 
in a greenhouse can greatly increase yield; Potter (2009) found a yield of 7.6 mL/m2, equivalent to 
77 L/ha2. However, the costs involved in producing essential oil indoors would be prohibitive.
As noted in Chapter 12, production of high-THC marijuana “buds” leaves “waste” (stems and 
foliage), which can serve as material from which intoxicating THC can be extracted as a secondary 
or salvage product. Similarly, as noted in Chapter 8, production of oilseed also leaves residue (floral 
bracts, foliage), which can serve as material from which nonintoxicating, medicinal CBD can be 
extracted as a secondary or salvage product. In principle, waste material from oilseed production 
could also be used as a source of terpenes.
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
The essential oil of C. sativa has some limited commercial value (examples of products are shown 
in Figure 9.4). Yields are very small—about 10 L/ha (Mediavilla and Steinemann 1997), so the 
 

187
Essential Oil
essential oil is expensive (Weightman and Kindred 2005 cited a retail price of £1000/L [=ca 
$1700/L]). Essential oil of different strains varies considerably in odor, and this may have economic 
importance in imparting a scent to cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, creams, oils, perfumes, and candles 
and a flavor to foodstuffs (particularly candy and beverages) or medicines. Alcoholic beverages 
made with hemp utilize hemp essential oil as a flavorant.
Aromatherapy—the therapeutic use of volatile oils—has become popular, and it is possible that 
cannabis volatile oils could achieve considerable market penetration. There is no evidence at present 
that cannabis essential oil is as effective as presently utilized aromatherapy oils. Nevertheless, there is 
a large market for cannabis products of whatever nature merely because C. sativa is notorious, and it 
would not be surprising if cannabis essential oils marketed for aromatherapy achieved market success.
REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS
Terpenes are natural flavor ingredients of numerous plants, and as long as they are in plant tissues, 
they are usually not of concern for safety considerations. Crude and purified terpene extracts are 
concentrated chemicals that often do have potential toxicity, and their use is frequently subject to 
safety regulations. The common terpenes from Cannabis are available from sources other than 
Cannabis. The principal terpenoid extract of Cannabis has simply been the volatile oil, and the 
chief regulatory concern associated with it is THC contamination. Cannabis essential oil is not an 
authorized product in many jurisdictions because of concern about THC content. THC has rela-
tively low volatility and water solubility (Malingré et al. 1975) and so is not expected to be present 
in appreciable concentrations in extracts prepared by steam distillation. It is possible to produce 
Cannabis essential oil capable of satisfying the regulatory needs for very low THC levels in food 
and other commercial goods.
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
Market Potential for Cannabis essential oil
Today, extracted cannabis essential oil is simply a novelty. The world market for hemp essential oil 
for flavoring or adding aroma to products is very limited at present and probably has limited growth 
possibilities, although as noted previously, the aromatherapy market may have some potential.
FIGURE 9.4 Products made with C. sativa essential oil. Left: Two bottles of hemp essential oil. Right: Pastilles

floral bracts.

breeding Cultivars for essential oil Harvest
As with oilseed cultivars, tall cultivars are disadvantageous in directing much of their energy into 
the production of stem tissue rather than reproductive tissue. Short plants with condensed flower-
ing axes are rich in flowers; hence, resin-synthesizing trichomes are a much better investment from 
the point of view of essential oil production on an area basis (exactly as for oilseed cultivars). As 
with marijuana strains and oilseed cultivars, male plants are of little or no use, and male expression 
could be reduced considerably. There are no cultivars selected mainly for essential oil, and given 
the limited market potential, breeding new varities just for terpenes seems unlikely at present. In 
Britain, the short-statured oilseed cultivar FINOLA has been employed for essential oil production 
(Weightman and Kindred 2005).
breeding Marijuana strains for attraCtive terPene Profile
As discussed in this chapter, the terpenes of Cannabis may have medicinal value as natural com-
ponents of medical marijuana, and certainly, the aroma associated with the terpenes has become a 
key criterion judged by consumers. At present, medicinal marijuana is substantially sold as a natural 
(“organic”) herbal, without additives, and if this situation persists, strains with attractive terpene 
profiles have potentially immense value. However, there seems no necessary reason why terpenes 
cheaply extracted from other plants can’t simply be added to marijuana lacking these attractive ter-
penes, so that breeding plants for terpene profile seems like a debatable investment.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• Although terpenes are effective repellents against many insects, some insects synthesize 
terpenes (often from precursors obtained by consuming plants) and use them as a defense 
against predators (Eisner 1970). Insects using terpenes as defensive chemicals include cat-
erpillars of swallowtail butterflies, some ants, and some termites. Some Silphidae beetles 
secrete foul-smelling terpene alcohols from a rectal gland. Like a skunk, one of these spe-
cies, Necrodes surinamensis, ejects this secretion and can rotate the end of its abdomen to 
spray in all directions (Roach et al. 1990).
• In 1981, U.S. President Ronald Reagan stated, “Trees cause more pollution than automo-
biles do.” The specious rationale for this controversial statement was that “photochemical 
smog” (also known as ground level ozone pollution), which is created when automobile 
emissions are broken down into ozone and other chemicals by strong sunlight, is ampli-
fied by the presence of various volatile organic compounds, particularly terpenes, which 
are released to the atmosphere in large amounts by coniferous trees in hot weather. While 
Reagan’s claim was ill-considered, the possibility that terpenes released by trees may have 
had a significant role in historical climate change (for example, reactive terpenes could 
have weakened the ozone layer protecting the planet) has been taken seriously in some 
scientific publications (e.g., Hari and Kulmala 2008).
• Humans can distinguish several million different colors and almost half a million different 
sounds, but our sense of smell is remarkably more acute, capable of discriminating more 
than one trillion smells (Bushdid et al. 2014).
• Cannabis essential oil is one of the world’s most expensive essential oils, sometimes sell-
ing for about $30.00/mL, although market prices fluctuate. Agarwood (from an endan-
gered Asian tropical tree, Aquilaria malaccensis), at about $40.00/mL, is often said to 
be the world’s most expensive essential oil. “Absolutes” are similar to essential oils but 
are extracted from plants by solvents or fats, whereas essential oils are typically obtained 
by steam distillation. Expensive absolutes include champaca (from a southern Asian tree, 
Michelia champaca) at $80.00/mL, frangipani (from a tropical American tree or shrub, 
 

189
Essential Oil
Plumeria rubra) at $50.00/mL, and tuberose (from the Mexican perennial Polianthes 
tuberosa) at $50.00/mL.
• Humans are not only fascinated by the odors of plants but also by the smell of other 
humans. One of the more curious studies reported that underarms of men smell of cheese 
while those of women smell of onions (Troccaz et al. 2009). The onion odor of women’s 
armpits was found to be due to high amounts of an odorless sulphur-containing compound, 
which underarm bacteria transformed into the onion-smelling chemical thiol. The cheesy 
odor of men’s armpits was caused by an odorless fatty acid which became smelly when 
acted on by underarm bacteria.

10 Minor Uses
Cannabis sativa is an exceptionally versatile crop. Fiber (Chapter 7), oilseed (Chapter 8), and 
cannabinoid drugs (Chapter 13) are the main economic products. Essential oil, of minor signifi-
cance, is discussed in Chapter 9. Other actual or potential uses are examined in this chapter. 
The following sequence of subchapters is arranged in decreasing order of probable potential 
usefulness.
BIOMASS
Merits of Cannabis sativa as a source of BioMass
Biomass refers to material from living or recently living organisms, especially from plants, which 
is usually employed as an energy source, either burned to produce heat or converted to biofuel. 
Numerous plants are capable of generating considerable biomass, and C. sativa is one of them 
(Poiša et al. 2010; Figure 10.1). Concern over rising prices and ecological damage associated with 
the use of petrochemicals has led to attempts to reduce fossil fuel use by substituting biomass plants 
to produce energy. Most biomass is currently derived from wood, but as discussed in Chapter 16, 
dealing with sustainability, trees are a diminishing resource, and crops are being considered as 
new sources of biomass. Hempseed-based biodiesel is discussed in Chapter 8. Biodiesel is usually 
produced from edible oilseed crops (such as rapeseed) and bioethanol is usually manufactured 
from edible carbohydrate crops (such as maize and sugar cane). This is controversial, since using 
cropland to produce biomass instead of food can reduce the availability and increase the cost of 
food, especially in low-income nations. It has been argued that using crops that produce only 
inedible “lignocellulosic biomass” (such as fiber hemp) avoids the ethical problem, but it does not, 
since the land could be used for food production (including oilseed hemp). Rehman et al. (2013) 
explored the possibility of using harvested wild-growing hemp in Pakistan as a source of biomass, 
which certainly would be an ethical strategy. As discussed in Chapter 16, C. sativa is an especially 
sustainable, environmentally friendly plant, and so when grown as a crop for whatever purpose, 
possibly including biomass production, it is relatively benign to the planet and to people. Compared 
to other crops grown for energy, hemp is considered to be a reasonably efficient source (Finnan and 
Styles 2013).
It has been contended that hemp is notably superior to most crops in terms of biomass pro-
duction, but Van der Werf (1994b) observed that the annual dry matter yield of hemp (rarely 
approaching 20 tonnes/ha) is not exceptional compared to corn, beet, or potato. Meijer et al. 
(1995) also noted that there are constraints to the biomass production of hemp. However, most 
hemp varieties have been selected for production of fiber, not for biomass. Hemp has been rated 
on a variety of criteria as one of the best crops available to produce energy in Europe (Biewinga 
and van der Bijl 1996). Hemp, especially the hurds, can be burned as is or processed into char-
coal, methanol, methane, or gasoline through pyrolysis (destructive distillation). Hemp could be 
used to create cellulosic-based ethanol (Sipos et al. 2010; Kuglarz et al. 2016). González-García 
et al. (2012) showed that ethanol derived from hemp hurds under some scenarios could be practi-
cal. However, conversion of hemp biomass into fuel or alcohol is impractical in areas where there 
are abundant supplies of wood, and energy can be produced relatively cheaply from a variety 
of sources. Prade et al. (2012) concluded, “The main competitors for hemp are maize and sugar 
beets for biogas production and the perennial crops willow, reed canary grass and miscanthus for 

192

solid biofuel production. Hemp is an above-average energy crop with a large potential for yield 
improvements.”
Biogas
“Biogas” (especially methane) is produced in some countries from various feedstocks, particularly 
animal waste, crop residues, household organic waste, and sewage sludge. In Germany, maize has 
been used as a source of biogas (Rehman et al. 2013), and other crops have been considered for 
the purpose. Mallik et al. (1990) studied the possibility of using hemp for methane production and 
decided that it was unsuitable for this purpose. Pinfold Consulting (1998) concluded that while 
there may be some potential for hemp biomass fuel near areas where hemp is cultivated, “a fuel 
ethanol industry is not expected to develop based on hemp.” Kreuger et al. (2011a,b) were more 
optimistic, considering hemp to be a potential source of biomass for biogas generators, based in 
part on their observation that steam pretreatment notably increased the conversion of hemp straw 
into methane.

marijuana plantation in Ottawa in 1971, described in Small et al. 1975).
 

193
Minor Uses
HeMp solid fuel
Hemp can be burned directly for energy (Rice 2008), but there has been limited interest in this. 
However, because of its high biomass productivity, hemp is a potential feedstock for the production 
of solid biofuels such as briquettes and pellets (Prade et al. 2011; Aluru et al. 2013). Pelleted combus-
tible material that can be used as fuel for pellet stoves and boilers represents a niche market. Today, 
fuel pellets are made almost exclusively from wood, although other biomass energy crops (such as 
cereal straw, miscanthus, switchgrass, and hemp) are being explored for the purpose (Kolarikova et 
al. 2013). Hemp produces relatively little ash when burned (often under 2%) and is comparable in 
corrosive effect to wood pellets (pellets from straw, miscanthus, and switchgrass can be relatively 
corrosive), and these are advantages for most pellet stoves currently marketed. However, Kolarikova 
et al. (2015) found that utilization of hemp for briquettes was not economically feasible.
NONSEED USE OF HEMP AS LIVESTOCK FEED
As noted in Chapter 8, hemp seed and its derivatives make excellent feed for animals. However, feed-
ing entire plants is another matter because the leaves are covered with resin-producing glands. The 
herbaceous material (not the seeds) appears to have toxic potential if eaten in very large amounts. 
While deer, groundhogs, rabbits, and other mammals will nibble on hemp plants, mammals gener-
ally do not choose to eat hemp. Jain and Aroroa (1988) fed marijuana refuse to cattle and found that 
the animals “suffered variable degrees of depression and revealed incoordination in movement.” 
Driemeier (1997) reported that four of five cattle died after consuming bales of dried marijuana 
leaves. Companion animals, especially dogs, occasionally are intoxicated as a result of consuming 
relatively small amounts of herbal marijuana but rarely are seriously harmed (foods such as brown-
ies prepared with marijuana extracts can result in large amounts being consumed and consequent 
greater risk; see Chapter 12).
The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances Used in Animal Feed (2011), a compre-
hensive committee-based evaluation of hempseed as animal feed, came to the following evaluation 
(pertaining to low-THC hemp): The whole hemp plant (including stalk and leaves), due to its high 
fiber content, would make a suitable feed material for ruminants (and horses), and daily amounts of 
0.5 to 1.5 kg whole hemp plant dry matter could likely be incorporated in the daily ration of dairy 
cows. However, due to observations that cows so fed secreted milk with THC and concern that other 
products (meat, eggs) could be similarly affected, the panel recommended that “whole hemp plant, 
hemp hurds, hemp flour (ground dried hemp leaves) should be placed on the list of materials whose 
placing on the market or use for animal nutritional purposes is restricted or prohibited.”
Letniak et al. (2000) conducted an experimental trial of hemp as silage. No significant differ-
ences were found between yield of the hemp and of barley/oat silage fed to heifers, suggesting that 
fermenting hemp plants reduces possible harmful constituents.
ORNAMENTAL USE
Hemp has, at times in the past, been grown simply for its ornamental value. The short, strongly 
branched cultivar Panorama (Figure 10.2), bred by Iván Bósca, was commercialized in Hungary 
in the 1980s (Journal of the IHA 1994) and has been said to be the only ornamental hemp cultivar 
available. It has had limited success, of course, because there are very few circumstances that per-
mit private gardeners to grow Cannabis as an ornamental today. By contrast, beautiful ornamental 
cultivars of opium poppy are widely grown in home gardens across North America, a very curi-
ous situation widely tolerated by the police and governments despite their illegality according to 
a strict interpretation of certain legislation. Tall fiber C. sativa has been employed in France as an 
ornamental maze (Figure 10.3). Doubtless, should it became legally permissible, many would grow 
hemp as an ornamental.

monoecious cultivar Fibrimon.

Minor Uses
HEMP AS A PROTECTIVE COMPANION PLANT
“Companion plants” are pairs of species, at least one of which benefits by being grown near the 
other. Sometimes, plant species are toxic to mobile insects, and their mere presence seems to safe-
guard nearby plants to some degree. Sometimes, plant species are allelopathic: toxic chemicals 
diffuse from them, particularly from the roots, and suppress nearby species, such as harmful soil 
organisms. As reviewed by McPartland (1997a), hemp near cotton and vegetable crops has been 
shown to protect them to some degree against certain of their pests, particularly nematodes, the 
reduction of these making the soil less threatening for subsequent different crops.
Crop rotation is a form of companion planting in which one species is deliberately planted in the 
same place as its benefactor grew the previous season. For most crops, rotation tends to reduce pests 
and diseases, in part because the unwanted organisms that build up on a given crop tend to have 
less success on the next season’s different crop. As noted in Chapter 7, hemp is best alternated with 
several different crops in sequence over a period of years. Hemp benefits particularly from being 
planted where legume crops with nitrogen-fixing bacterial associates, such as alfalfa and clovers, 
have grown. In turn, hemp can benefit other crops in the rotation.
NATURAL PESTICIDES
McPartland (1997a) reviewed research on the pesticide and repellent applications of Cannabis. 
Powdered material and extracts of C. sativa have been used as antifeedants, repellents, and insec-
ticides (Bouquet 1950; McPartland 1997b). Mukhtar et al. (2013) found that C. sativa is effective 
against nematodes. Gorski et al. (2009) found that hemp oil repelled aphids. There are numer-
ous studies of the effects of crude preparations of cannabis on various classes of noxious organ-
isms, but there is often insufficient evidence to attribute the effects to particular chemicals present. 
Nevertheless, dried plant parts and extracts of Cannabis have received rather extensive usage as 
homemade repellents in the past, raising the possibility that research could produce formulations 
of commercial value. Natural plant pesticides tend to be relatively benign to the environment and 
biodiversity compared to synthetics, so they are often welcomed in the marketplace. However, the 
commercial value of cannabis extracts is uncertain at present.
HEMP JEWELRY
Hemp jewelry combines colored hemp twine and (usually) colorful beads in the form of anklets, 
bracelets, necklaces, purses, and various other (usually female) accessories (see Figure 10.4). 
Wearing hemp jewelry has been popular among youth, frequently as an expression of “eco-chic.” As 
expressed by Dvorak (2004), “Around college campuses and at concerts and village greens, hemp 
twine jewelry worn by the younger generation has become ubiquitous. Many people wearing it con-
sider this to be a statement that they are for the environment and against cannabis hemp prohibition. 
Others simply wear it because it’s cool.” Complex knitting and knotting are often employed. Kits 
FIGURE 10.4 Examples of hemp jewelry. Headbands by Totally Hemp (CC BY 2.0).
 

196
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
for preparing hemp jewelry are widely available and so are preparation instructions on the Internet 
and in books (e.g., Baskett 1999; Lunger 1999). The recent interest in using hemp fiber for arts and 
crafts preparations mainly for women’s attire is ironic, given that since ancient times, the Chinese 
have employed hemp to prepare astonishingly artistic items of the same nature (Figure 10.5).
HEMPSEED AS FISH BAIT
In some European countries, hempseed is considered to be an outstanding fish lure and is often 
sold in bait shops as dry, sterilized seeds. The seeds are usually prepared by boiling to the point 
that a hook will pass easily through them. Many anglers simply toss the intact hulled or ground-up 
seeds into the water to attract fish, using hooks baited with other materials to actually catch the 
fish. Instructional videos on the use of hempseeds for fishing are available online. In the United 
Kingdom, where hempseed is a popular fish bait, some fishermen with hempseeds intended for 
fishing have been arrested and charged with possession of a narcotic—an obvious misapplication 
of the law.
HEMPSEED AS A GROWTH MEDIUM FOR FUNGI 
AND OTHER MICROORGANISMS
Mycologists frequently employ boiled hempseed in sterile water to culture aquatic fungi, and 
indeed, this is the medium of choice for numerous water molds. Since hempseed is very attractive 
to many fungi and some other microorganisms that grow in water, hempseed is also often placed 
in natural aquatic (and even terrestrial) habitats for a period as “bait,” and after the seeds have been 
colonized by these organisms, the material can be examined to determine exactly which species are 
present in the location.
HEMP AS AN AGRICULTURAL POLLEN BARRIER
One of the most curious uses of hemp, occasionally observed in Europe, is as a tall fence to physi-
cally prevent pollen transfer in commercial production of seeds. Isolation distances for ensuring 
that seeds produced are pure are considerable for many plants and are sometimes too large to be 
FIGURE 10.5 Gorgeous handbags made with hemp, exhibited in the Yunnan Nationalities Museum,

197
Minor Uses
practical. At one point in the 1980s, the only permitted use of hemp in Germany was as a fence 
or hedge to prevent plots of beets being used for seed production from becoming contaminated by 
pollen from ruderal beets. The high and rather impenetrable hedge that hemp can produce was con-
sidered unsurpassed by any other species for the purpose. As well, the sticky leaves of hemp were 
thought to trap pollen. However, Saeglitz et al. (2000) demonstrated that the spread of beet pollen is 
only partly prevented by hemp hedges. Tall fiber varieties of hemp were also once used in Europe 
as wind-breaks, protecting vulnerable crops against wind damage. Although hemp plants can lodge 
(bend over permanently), on the whole, very tall hemp is remarkably resistant against wind.
EDIBLE SHOOTS (STEMS AND FOLIAGE)
The extensive edible uses of the seeds and their fixed seed oil and the possible use of seedlings as 
sprouts are discussed in Chapter 8. The flavoring use of the essential oil is discussed in Chapter 9. 
As noted in Chapter 4, honey bees collect pollen from C. sativa, and so some of this may end up in 
honey, although almost certainly in insignificant amounts. Recreational marijuana is widely incor-
porated into edible preparations (Chapter 12). However, eating the foliage, stems, or floral material 
is unpleasant and at least slightly toxic, and edible material for humans generally has been prepared 
by extracting THC (usually in fats such as butter when used in brownies and the like or in alcohol 
in liquid preparations), so that the marijuana itself is not eaten. Despite the lack of palatability and 
potential toxicity, there are statements from various authors (not well documented) that leaves, 
twigs, or flowers are occasionally eaten (Cheatham et al. 2009, pp. 38–39). As noted in Chapter 12, 
bhang is a traditional Asian beverage made with chopped cannabis foliage.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• The use of plant biomass to generate fuels is widely regarded as an important environmen-
tally beneficial way to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and the consequent genera-
tion of greenhouse gases contributing to greenhouse gases and climate change. Until 2012, 
the European Union (EU) heavily subsidized crops such as hemp and flax that are regarded 
as good for the environment. In the 1990s, the EU provided a subsidy of more than $1000 
per hectare (approximately $400/acre) for farmers who grew flax and hemp. In a classic 
example of how good-intentioned legislation can be abused, in 1998, thousands of hectares 
of flax were grown in Spain and Ireland, the subsidies were collected, and all of the crops 
were simply unharvested or burned in the fields, worsening environmental pollution.
• Supercapacitors are energy storage devices using activated carbon electrodes to provide 
quick bursts of power. They are used currently in braking systems for buses and fast-
charging flashlights. Heating and chemically treating hemp phloem fibers have been found 
to produce a material with potential to store much more energy in supercapacitors than the 
activated carbon electrodes currently used (Wang et al. 2013).
• According to Popular Mechanics (1938), “Thousands of tons of hemp hurds are used every 
year by one large powder company for the manufacture of dynamite and TNT.” Hemp 
hurds (the woody interior of hemp stems) are highly absorbent and so would have been use-
ful to soak up the explosive chemicals in cylinders or sticks. However, the use of organic 
materials such as hemp hurds and sawdust to hold the explosives has generally been dis-
continued in favor of more stable absorbents.

11 Cannabis Chemistry: 
Cannabinoids in Cannabis, 
Humans, and Other Species
Plants produce thousands of chemical compounds, and Cannabis sativa is no exception. Chemical 
aspects of the stem fiber, oilseeds, and essential oil are dealt with in other chapters. This chapter 
deals with the cannabinoids, the chief chemicals of interest. As will be discussed, there is evidence 
of compounds that are structurally similar to the cannabinoids in a few other plants.
Much more importantly, there are analogous (structurally dissimilar but functionally similar) 
compounds, also considered to be cannabinoids, in humans and other animals, that affect metabo-
lism in countless ways. Indeed, as discussed in Chapter 13, it is now clear that ingestion of plant 
and synthetic cannabinoids affects humans, for better or worse, by altering the body’s metabolic 
engines, which normally employ internally produced cannabinoids. Also, in many plants, there are 
chemicals that are structurally dissimilar to the cannabinoids of Cannabis or humans that can also 
influence animal metabolism (including human physiology) by influencing the metabolic system 
that handles cannabinoids. However, this chapter is mostly concerned with the cannabinoids of 
C. sativa: where they are produced in the plant, variation of concentrations in different kinds of 
plant and in different growth circumstances, and their basic chemistry.
GLANDULAR TRICHOMES OF CANNABIS: THE PLANT’S DRUG FACTORIES
Most plant species have very small epidermal appendages termed “trichomes” on the aerial parts, 
widely considered to be protective against pathogens and arthropod herbivores (Levin 1973), 
although numerous other hypotheses have been proposed to explain their presence (Wagner 1990; 
Werker 2000; Theis and Lerdau 2003; Wagner et al. 2004). Trichomes are sometimes termed “hairs” 
because they are often hair-like, but most biologists reserve the term hair for animals. Nonglandular 
trichomes were discussed in Chapter 6; this section deals with glandular trichomes (which, like 
human glands, synthesize particular chemicals).
About 30% of flowering plants possess “glandular trichomes,” producing secondary chemicals, 
usually at the tip of the structure, often in distinctive head-like containers (Dell and McComb 
1978; Glas et al. 2012). (Secondary chemicals are organic compounds produced during metabolism, 
which are not directly involved in essential biological structures or in normal development or repro-
duction.) The substances manufactured are frequently known to serve the plant as protective agents 
but are also often immensely useful to humans as natural pesticides, food additives, fragrances, 
and pharmaceuticals (Duke et al. 2000). The psychoactive chemicals of Cannabis (cannabinoids, 
principally THC) are produced in specialized tiny secretory trichomes, which are almost always 
multicellular (the nonglandular trichomes of C. sativa are unicellular).
There is by no means agreement by botanists how multicellular secretory trichomes should be 
classified, either in plants generally or Cannabis specifically. The most important criterion for dis-
tinguishing classes of trichomes in Cannabis is stalk length, and size is next in importance.
As many as three classes of epidermal secretory glandular trichomes can be distinguished on 
the basis of basal stalk. The so-called stalkless or sessile type, which hardly resembles a hair-
like structure, may have a very short stalk that is not visible as it is hidden under the gland 
head (Figure 11.1). These glandular trichomes tend to be comparatively small. The long-stalked

(Figures 11.2 through 11.4) and short-stalked (Figure 11.3c, in part) types are distinguished arbi-
trarily on the basis of stalk length and tend to be comparatively large. Additionally, a very dis-
tinctive kind of glandular trichome occurs on the anthers (Figure 11.5). In all of these cases, the 
essential part of the gland is a more or less hemispherical head, sometimes compared in size to the 
head of a pin. Inside the head at its base there are specialized secretory “disk cells,” and above these

there is a noncellular cavity where secreted resin is accumulated, enlarging the covering sheath 
(a waxy cuticle) of the head into a spherical blister (Figure 11.2). The resin is a sticky mixture of 
cannabinoids and a variety of terpenes. In marijuana varieties, the resin is rich in the cannabinoid 
THC, the chief intoxicant of Cannabis, as discussed later.
Happyana et al. (2013) found that the stalks of stalked glandular trichomes contained traces of 
cannabinoids, but whether this is the result of contamination is unclear, and it does seem that most, 
if not all, of the cannabinoids are synthesized in the secretory disk cells. Lanyon et al. (1981) showed 
that nearly all of the cannabinoids of the stalked glands occur in the noncellular cavity above the 
disk cells. Its sheath may eventually rupture, releasing resin onto the surface of the plant. Hot condi-
tions seem to favor release of the resin, but apparently there has been selection for strains that retain 
resin within the gland heads so that when fabric sieves are used to prepare hashish (as described in 
Chapter 12), they will not become clogged with sticky resin. However, strains that produce extruded 
sticky resin have been favored when leather or hands are used to rub off the resin for hashish prepa-
ration (Clarke 1998a; McPartland and Guy 2004a).
Various authors (e.g., Clarke and Watson 2002; Mahlberg and Kim 2004) have characterized a 
narrowed portion of the top of the stalk, just below the base of the head, as an “abscission layer.” 
In the living state, the gland heads always burst immediately when touched but do not readily 
fall off from the living plant, so just why stalked glandular trichomes develop a constricted area 
just beneath the gland heads is unclear adaptively. In no way is the “abscission layer” of cannabis 
stalked trichomes comparable to the abscission zone at the base of the foliage of deciduous trees 
or at the base of fruits that abscise at maturity (as described in detail in Chapter 3 for the fruit of 
Cannabis). There seems no obvious reason why dropping the heads is adaptive from the plant’s 
perspective (which they simply do not do while fresh) but when the plants is dried, the gland heads 
do fall off very readily when agitated. This facilitates harvesting the heads for hashish preparation, 
and some strains may have been selected for ease of harvesting the heads for making intoxicating 
preparations.
The secretory glands differ notably in density on different organs of the plant (high concen-
trations occur on the lower surface of the young leaves, on young twigs, on the sepals, anthers 
[Figure 11.5], and especially on the perigonal bracts [Figure 11.3], where they are very dense and 
productive). Given this distribution, the glands seem to be protective of young and reproductive 
above-ground exposed tissues (the roots and achenes, which are not exposed, lack glands). Clarke 
(1998a) observed that marijuana varieties differ widely in the size of glands, but there is evidence 
that selection of high-THC forms has favored greater gland size, greater gland density, or both 
(Small and Naraine 2016b). Small and Naraine (2016b) found that a sample of elite pharmaceuti-
cal strains all had much larger gland heads than those of industrial hemp cultivars. Mahlberg and

Kim (2004) recorded that the cannabinoid content of the long-stalked glands they examined pos-
sessed about 20 times the cannabinoid content of the sessile glands. The glands of Cannabis have 
been described in detail by Potter (2009) and extensively examined by Mahlberg and associates 
(Hammond and Mahlberg 1977, 1978; Turner et al., 1980, 1981a,b; Mahlberg et al. 1984; Mahlberg 
and Kim 1991, 1992, 2004; Kim and Mahlberg 1995, 1997, 2003). It has been established that can-
nabinoids are synthesized within the secretory glands, not elsewhere, and transported to the glands 
(Sirikantaramas et al. 2005; Stout et al. 2012). By contrast, the alkaloid nicotine is synthesized in 
the roots of tobacco plants and transported to trichomes of the foliage, a phenomenon recorded in 
several other plants (Vivanco and Baluška 2012).
Comparatively small glands with very small heads (sometimes unicellular, typically less than 
20 microns in diameter) and very short stalks (sometimes just two cells) often occur over much of 
the plant. Such glands are often termed “bulbous,” in contrast to the larger glands described previ-
ously, which are termed “capitate” (meaning head-like). (Bulbous and capitate are not obviously 
distinguishable terms and can be misleading.) The small glands could simply have failed to develop 
into larger glands. They are so small that they cannot produce appreciable amounts of the can-
nabinoids. A long-stalked gland with a capitate secretory head is widely referred to as a “stalked-
capitate trichome” and is somewhat reminiscent of a golf ball sitting atop a golf tee.
Most THC in cannabis drug preparations is located in the resin heads of the stalked glandular tri-
chomes, which cover the protective perigonal bracts enveloping the pistils and seeds. Stalked glands 
are located mainly on the perigonal bracts in the inflorescence but also often occur on the veins 
of the underside of the leaves. Small and Naraine (2016b) found that after harvest, the resin heads 
shrink in diameter in exponential decay fashion under ambient room conditions, losing about 15% 
of their diameter in the first month, rising to 25% over the first year, 30% by 40 years, and 33% after 
a century (Figure 11.6). An equation accounting for the asymptotic curve descriptive of the progres-
sion of shrinkage was determined (original gland head diameter in microns = observed diameter) 
divided by ([0.5255 + 0.4745 multiplied by time in days to the power −0.1185]), so that if the age of 
a specimen is known, the original diameter of the gland heads in the fresh state can be extrapolated.
There is controversial evidence for trace amounts of cannabinoid production outside of the epi-
dermal glands. Laticifers (latex-containing internal tissues or cells) occur in the foliage and stems 
(Zander 1928). These are of the unbranched, nonarticulated form, made up of an elongated secretory 
cell producing a kind of latex. Furr and Mahlberg (1981) reported that they detected cannabinoids

in laticifers of C. sativa. However, because of the possibility of contamination, the presence of 
cannabinoids in the laticifers needs to be verified. Veliky and Genest (1972), Hemphill et al. (1978), 
Pacifico et al. (2008), Flores-Sanchez et al. (2009), and others found no production of THC in tissue 
cultures, suggesting that nonsecretory cells do not produce cannabinoids. However, some experi-
ments have demonstrated production of cannabinoids in cell cultures of Cannabis, but in extremely 
limited amounts (Heitrich and Binder 1982; Hartsel et al. 1983; Loh et al. 1983; Mandolino and 
Ranalli 1998). Braemer and Paris (1987) showed that cell cultures could at least transform some 
cannabinoids to other cannabinoids.
CANNABINOIDS IN CANNABIS SATIVA
ClarifiCation of the term “PsyChoaCtive”
In Chapter 13, the section “Pharmacological Terminology for Marijuana” discusses at length the 
various terms that have been applied to describe the psychological states produced by marijuana. 
This chapter provides information on the effect of several of the cannabinoids, the most significant 
chemicals in C. sativa. Before proceeding, it is important to clarify the meaning of “psychoactive,” 
a term that is very widely employed for cannabis in a selective way. Etymologically, “psychoac-
tive” should mean “psychologically active,” i.e., significantly affecting mental status, which could 
include any of mood, emotion, perception, and cognition. In the context of discussing cannabis, a 
tradition has developed of employing “psychoactive” to refer exclusively to the euphoria (the “high” 
or intoxicant state) produced by marijuana, while ignoring other significant induced mental states, 
most particularly sedation, but also such other effects as anxiety (reduction or increase).
In reading most of the pharmacological and experimental cannabis literature, it is therefore 
important to consider how authors are employing the term “psychoactive.” Most egregiously, the 
cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) is almost universally referred to as “nonpsychoactive,” which indis-
putably is incorrect (i.e., although CBD will not induce marijuana intoxication, depending on dos-
age and context, it will modify psychological status). Burstein (2015) pointed out, “the structure of 
CBD was not completely elucidated until 1963. Subsequent studies resulted in the pronouncement 
that THC was the ‘active’ principle of Cannabis and research then focused primarily on it to the 
virtual exclusion of CBD. This was no doubt due to the belief that activity meant psychoactivity that 
was shown by THC and not by CBD. In retrospect this must be seen as unfortunate.” Piomelli and 
Russo (2016) stated, “although cannabidiol is nonintoxicating, it certainly has antianxiety, antipsy-
chotic, and even antidepressant effects, so properly they must be considered psychoactive.”
ClarifiCation of the term “Drug”
Occasionally, kinds of C. sativa used for production of marijuana (always high in THC) are referred 
to as drug strains, in contrast to kinds grown as hemp (almost always low in THC but high in CBD). 
Indeed, Clarke and Merlin (2015) recommended this nomenclatural distinction. Restricting “drug 
strain” to high-THC C. sativa often implies that this kind of Cannabis is consumed for recreational 
or spiritual purposes. However, employing high levels of THC as a basis for defining “drug” kinds 
of C. sativa may reflect either a pejorative way of implying that marijuana is harmful or a mis-
taken notion that THC is the principal Cannabis cannabinoid of medicinal value. As detailed in 
Chapter 13, CBD has at least as much potential for use in drugs as THC and indeed is currently 
under exploration for treatment of many more medical conditions.
BasiC Chemistry of the CannaBinoiDs
Cannabis contains an unusual class of terpenophenolic secondary metabolites, defined as “canna-
binoids” (Mechoulam and Gaoni 1967). It was once believed that these natural plant cannabinoids 
 

205
Cannabis Chemistry
constituted all cannabinoids, but over time, broader conceptions of “cannabinoids” have developed. 
Cannabinoids have become so significant that they are the subject of thousands of articles published 
annually (Bab 2011). More than 100 cannabinoids in C. sativa have been described (Grotenhermen 
and Russo 2002; ElSohly and Slade 2005; ElSohly 2006; Radwan et al. 2009; De Meijer 2014). 
According to ElSohly and Gul (2014), over 150 cannabinoids have been recorded for C. sativa.
Numerous publications discussing the kind of cannabinoids found in C. sativa state that they 
are unique to Cannabis, but this is incorrect. There are reports in the literature that cannabinoids 
occur in other plants—in the composite Helichrysum (Bohlmann and Hoffmann 1979; Lourens 
et al. 2008), in the liverwort Radula (Toyota et al. 1994, 2002), and in the legume Glycyrrhiza 
foetida Desf. (Raedestorff et al. 2012). Cannabinoid-like compounds have also been reported in 
the legumes Amorpha (Kemal et al. 1979), Machaerium multiflorum (Muhammad et al. 2001), and 
Desmodium canum (Botta et al. 2003). The fungus Cylindrocarpon olidum produces cannabiorci-
chromenic acid (Quaghebeur et al. 1994).
However, virtually all specialists on the cannabinoids are of the view that they are more charac-
teristic of Cannabis than any other plant, and the major cannabinoids of C. sativa occur only in this 
species. Additional chemical investigation is required to establish whether some of the cannabinoids 
of C. sativa that have been described occur as original metabolic products of the plant or are degen-
erative products or artefacts.
Delta-9-THC (Δ9-THC, or simply THC) and CBD are the plant cannabinoids of most importance. 
THC is the principal intoxicant constituent of C. sativa, and CBD, which is not intoxicating, is the 
principal cannabinoid of hemp (nonintoxicating forms of C. sativa). Both compounds have numer-
ous medicinal properties, as presented in Chapter 13. THC was isolated from C. sativa, molecu-
larly characterized, and even synthesized in the laboratory of Raphael Mechoulam (Figure 11.7) in 
the mid-1960s (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1964). As detailed in other chapters, plants that have been 
selected for fiber and oilseed characteristics usually produce resin in the secretory glands, which

noids of humans. Photo provided by Dr. Mechoulam.

has no or limited amounts of THC, but high amounts of CBD. In Chapter 18, these are placed in 
C. sativa subsp. sativa. In contrast, plants that have been selected for intoxicating drug properties 
are generally high in THC and are placed in C. sativa subsp. indica. As discussed in Chapters 12 
and 13, “sativa type” marijuana strains have no or very little CBD, while “indica type” marijuana 
strains frequently have substantial amounts of both THC and CBD (Figure 11.8).
In the living plant, the cannabinoids exist predominantly in the form of carboxylic acids (i.e., 
a –COOH radicle is attached to the molecule). These decarboxylate into their neutral counterparts 
(the molecules lose the acidic –COOH radicle, leaving an H atom), as shown for THC in Figure 11.9, 
under the influence of light, time (such as prolonged storage), alkaline conditions, or when heated, 
as occurs when marijuana is smoked or cooked (e.g., in brownies). Romano and Hazekamp (2013) 
noted that cooking marijuana in an oven at 145°C for 30 minutes substantially decarboxylated the 
material, with very little degeneration to cannabinol (CBN).
The more important cannabinoids are shown in Figure 11.10 (see the legend for abbreviations 
of the cannabinoid names). These have a basic 21-carbon skeleton (22 in the carboxylated forms). 
The designation Δ9-THC employs formal chemical nomenclature for pyran-type compounds (the 
“dibenzopyran system,” favored in North America; in an alternative nomenclature system often 
employed in Europe, the “monoterpenoid system,” based on regarding the cannabinoids as substi-
tuted monoterpenoids, this is known as Δ1-THC). The “Δ9” in Δ9-THC points out the presence of a 
carbon–carbon double bond (indicated by Δ) located between carbon atoms 9 and 10, as indicated 
by the exponent 9 in Δ9 (Khan et al. 2012).
THC is the world’s most popular illicit chemical and indeed the fourth most popular recre-
ational chemical after caffeine, ethyl alcohol, and nicotine, all of which are addictive. Other THC 
isomers also occur, particularly Δ8-THC, which is also euphoric. Δ8-THC is much less abundant 
in C. sativa, occurring only in trace amounts if at all and is somewhat less potent than Δ9-THC,

FIGURE 11.9 Spontaneous alteration of THC with time and/or storage conditions. In the living plant, 
Δ9-THC is carboxylated (with a –COOH moiety attached to the benzene ring), and in this form (known as 
THCA), it is only marginally psychoactive. With mild heat (as applied when smoking or vaporizing mari-
juana), drying, or aging after harvest, Δ9-THC-COOH decarboxylates to form CO2 and Δ9-THC, which is 
psychoactive. THC degenerates with time (especially at higher temperatures and when exposed to oxygen) to 
CBN, which has much reduced psychoactivity.

although somewhat more heat-stable than Δ9-THC. CBN, the principal degeneration or oxidative 
breakdown product produced when Δ9-THC ages (Δ8-THC is notably more stable and persists in 
old material), is generally considered to have limited psychoactive potential—perhaps about 25% 
of the potency of THC (Piomelli and Russo 2016). Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) “is certainly 
psychoactive, but rarely seen in high titer in commonly available Cannabis strains” (Piomelli and 
Russo 2016). The other molecules shown in Figure 11.10 are not euphoriant and, if present, almost 
always occur only in small concentrations.

FIGURE 11.10 Chemical diagrams (decarboxylated forms) of several of the well-known cannabinoids. 
Δ9-THC is the chief intoxicant chemical and predominates in marijuana strains, while the isomer Δ8-THC, 
which is somewhat less intoxicant, is usually present in no more than trace amounts. CBN is a frequent degra-
dation or oxidation product, usually not appreciably present in the fresh plant; it has some intoxicating ability. 
The remaining compounds shown are not intoxicant or at least not appreciably so and, except for CBD, are 
usually present in trace amounts or are absent. CBD is the chief nonintoxicant chemical and predominates in 
hemp strains. As described in Chapter 13, CBD has an astonishing variety of therapeutic properties. CBC is 
often detected in high-THC strains. CBG is the biosynthetic precursor (in the carboxylated form, as shown in 
Figure 11.11) of THC and CBD. It is more often observed in nonintoxicant strains than in high-THC strains. 
CBGM has been detected especially in populations from northeastern Asia. CBDV has been reported in popu-
lations from central Asia. THCV is usually present in trace amounts but occasionally in significant quantities, 
especially in populations from Asia and Africa.
 

208
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
(Ross and ElSohly 1997). CBN has been estimated to have 10% of the activity of THC (Pertwee 
2008), and because it is much less psychoactive, marijuana preparations have a limited shelf life 
(Fairbairn et al. 1976; Lewis and Turner 1978; Narayanaswami et al. 1978; Harvey 1990; Trofin 
et al. 2011, 2012). High temperature, moisture (high humidity), light, and oxygen all contribute to 
gradual lowering of the quality (potency) of cannabis drug preparations, but storage in a dark, cool 
place with exclusion of air minimizes loss of activity (Clarke 1998a). It appears that the intact gland 
heads act as microcontainers, providing some protection against degradation of THC, presumably 
particularly against oxidation. Estimates of the shelf life of cannabis preparations vary considerably. 
Clarke (1998a) stated that at room temperature, 50% of THC is lost annually in hashish. Lindholst 
(2010) observed exponential decay of THC content in hashish over four years, with about a one-
third reduction in the first year. However, Health Canada (2013) stated that only a third of the THC 
content of marijuana stored at room temperature is lost over a five-year period. Turner et al. (1973) 
measured the decomposition rate of THC in flowering tops. They stored the buds in darkness for 
two years, in glass jars with aluminum screw-caps. At room temperature (22°C), THC decomposed 
at a rate of 6.9% loss/year. In a refrigerator at 4°C, the loss dropped to 5.4% per year. In a freezer at 
−18°C, the loss decreased to 3.8% annually.
variation of CannaBinoiDs among Different KinDs of CannaBis Plants
There is a general inverse relationship in the resin of Cannabis between the amount of THC present 
and the amount of CBD. Whereas most drug strains contain primarily THC and little or no CBD, 
fiber and oilseed strains primarily contain CBD and very little THC.
There have been numerous studies of cannabinoid variation, mostly employing the predomi-
nance of either THC or CBD respectively as indicators of intoxicating marijuana kinds and 
nonintoxicating hemp kinds (for examples, Fetterman et al. 1971; Small and Beckstead 1973a,b; 
Small et al. 1975; Avico et al. 1985). Many publications have recognized “chemical phenotypes” 
based particularly on ratios of THC and CBD in the resin or on the presence of one of the less com-
mon cannabinoids. In Chapter 18, two subspecies are recognized using THC content for separation.
Cannabis sativa subsp. sativa has limited THC, and C. sativa subsp. indica has appreciable 
THC. A dividing line of 0.3% (dry weight content in the inflorescence or young infructescence) 
was established by Small et al. (1976) based on study of variation in several hundred populations 
and subsequently was adopted in the European Community, Canada, parts of Australia, and the 
U.S.S.R. as a criterion between cultivars that can be legally cultivated under license and forms that 
are considered to have too high a drug potential (in some countries, the allowable level is currently 
different). The 113th U.S. Congress enacted the Agricultural Act of 2014 (“farm bill,” P.L. 113-79), 
which provided a statutory definition of “industrial hemp” as the plant C. sativa L. and any part 
of such plant with a Δ9-THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. A level of 
about 1% THC is considered the threshold for marijuana to have intoxicating potential, so the 0.3% 
level is conservative, and some jurisdictions (e.g., Switzerland and parts of Australia) have permit-
ted the cultivation of cultivars with higher levels. It is well known in the illicit trade how to screen 
off the more potent fractions of the plant in order to increase THC levels in resultant drug products. 
Nevertheless, a level of 0.3% THC in the flowering parts of the plant is reflective of material that 
is too low in intoxicant potential to actually be used practically for illicit production of marijuana 
or other types of cannabis drugs. While this criterion is in common use to separate adult plants, 
the ratio of CBD and THC often suffices to distinguish high-THC and low-THC plants as young 
as seedlings (Rowan and Fairbairn 1977; Broséus et al. 2010; De Backer et al. 2012). However, 
Vogelmann et al. (1988) found that the cannabinoids of extremely young seedlings were dominated 
by cannabichromene (CBC), and De Meijer et al. (2009a) also observed that CBC is often dominant 
in juvenile plants and young cuttings.
CBC is a frequent minor constituent of highly intoxicating strains of C. sativa, especially from 
Africa, and strains high in CBC have been selected for medicinal experimentation. De Meijer 
 

209
Cannabis Chemistry
et al. (2009a) provided evidence that CBC is present in substantial amounts in juvenile plants and 
declines with maturation. These authors found plant variants in which CBC persisted into maturity 
and noticed that this is associated with a reduced presence of perigonal bracts and secretory glands. 
Potter (2009) recorded a greater presence of CBC in the small (nonstalked) secretory glands of the 
foliage than in the large (stalked) glands of the inflorescence.
Cannabigerol (CBG) rarely dominates the resin of Cannabis (Fournier et al. 1987). Some geo-
graphical races with minor or trace amounts of cannabinoids have been described, notably for 
cannabigerol monomethyl ether (CBGM) in some northeastern Asian populations, cannabidivarin 
(CBDV) in some populations from central Asia, and THCV in some collections from Asia and 
Africa.
CONVERSION OF NONINTOXICANT CBD TO INTOXICANT THC 
IN THE LABORATORY AND POSSIBLY IN THE HUMAN BODY
The nonintoxicant CBD can be converted to the intoxicant THC by acid catalysis (i.e., acidic condi-
tions stimulate the reaction), a fact which has been known for many years (Adams et al. 1940, 1941). 
More recent research demonstrated that laboratory conversion could be carried out using a number 
of acidic reagents (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1966, 1968). Watanabe et al. (2007) found that gastric 
juice converted CBD to THC and other cannabinoids with limited intoxicant ability, suggesting 
that some CBD in edible forms of marijuana could be converted to THC in vivo (in animals). The 
possible conversion of CBD to THC raises the possibility that the illicit cannabis trade could take 
CBD from industrial hemp and use it to make THC or other intoxicating analogues. However, the 
chemical reactions required are elaborate and expensive, and there are no reports of illicit attempts 
to manufacture THC from CBD. A process to convert CBD to THC has been patented (Webster 
et al. 2008). The fact that stomach acid is capable of converting at least a small amount of CBD to 
THC in orally ingested edible forms of marijuana may be of more than academic interest, since this 
can influence both experimental and therapeutic results (Watanabe et al. 2007). However, “although 
CBD can turn into THC at very low pH, there is absolutely no evidence that this occurs in the 
human body. GW Pharmaceuticals did extensive pharmacokinetic studies with pure cannabidiol 
and none of those patients showed any serum levels of THC or its direct metabolites” (Ethan Russo, 
personal communication).

with pentyl side chains (CBC, CBD, CBG, and THC) were established in the 1990s. The first event 
in the pentyl cannabinoid biosynthesis is the production of CBG, produced by condensation of a 
phenol-derived olivetolic acid and a terpene-based geranylpyrophosphate catalyzed by the enzyme 
geranylpyrophosphate:olivetolate geranyltransferase (Fellermeier and Zenk 1998). From CBG, 
Δ9-THC, CBD, and CBC are synthesized, each by a specific synthase enzyme. The enzyme con-
verting CBG to THC was clarified by Taura et al. (1995). The enzyme converting CBG to CBD 
was studied by Taura et al. (1996, 1997). An outline of the biosynthesis of the two most important 
cannabinoids, THC and CBD, is shown in Figure 11.11. For more complete analyses of cannabinoid 
biosynthesis, see Sirikantaramas et al. (2007), Flores-Sanchez and Verpoorte (2008), Van Bakel 
et al. (2011), and Gagne et al. (2012).
As emphasized by Hillig (2002), De Meijer et al. (2003), and De Meijer (2014), it is important to 
distinguish quantitative and qualitative aspects of cannabinoid inheritance. The absolute quantity 
of cannabinoids produced by an individual plant or by a population (on an acreage basis) depends 
on growth and developmental traits (such as size and proportion of tissues constituted by secretory 
glands), which are (a) probably determined polygenically, (b) unrelated to cannabinoid biosynthetic 
pathways, and (c) subject to strong environmental modification. Qualitative aspects, discussed in 
 

210
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
the next paragraph, relate to the genetic control of genes influencing the relative amounts of the 
cannabinoids.
First-generation (F1) hybrids between high-THC marijuana strains and high-CBD fiber cultivars 
are usually more or less intermediate between the parents. Small and Beckstead (1979) found that 
numerous first-generation hybrids were more or less intermediate in THC proportion. Beutler and 
Der Marderosian (1978) crossed a ruderal low-THC form and a race with higher THC and also found 
that the first-generation hybrids were more or less intermediate, although the progeny tended to fall 
into two groups with respect to THC proportion, one tending to the parent with the higher level, the 
other tending to the parent with the lower level. As expected for an outcrossing species, F1 hybrids 
frequently show evidence of heterosis for various characteristics. Various authors have observed 
cannabinoid segregation ratios in F2 generation hybrids (see literature citations in De Meijer et al. 
2003), and as discussed in the next paragraph, this is due to allelic segregation.
Sytnik and Stelmah (1999) suggested that CBD and THC are controlled by closely linked but 
independent genes. Inheritance of the key cannabinoids THC acid (THCA) and CBD acid (CBDA) 
was found to be apparently determined by the allelic status at a single locus (referred to as B) (De 
Meijer et al. 2003; Mandolino et al. 2003; Pacifico et al. 2006). De Meijer et al. (2003) (cf. Mandolino 
and Ranalli 2002; Mandolino et al. 2003; Mandolino 2004) found evidence that THCA develop-
ment in C. sativa is under the partial genetic control of codominant alleles. Allele BD is postulated

sion of CBDA to CBD) is not part of the biosynthetic pathway but occurs spontaneously with aging and/or heat.

to encode CBDA synthase, while allele BT encodes THCA synthase. This genetic model holds that 
plants in which CBDA is predominant have a BD/BD genotype at the B locus, plants in which THC is 
predominant have a BT/BT genotype, and plants with substantial amounts of both THCA and CBDA 
are heterozygous (BD/BT genotype). De Meijer and Hammond (2005) found that plants accumulat-
ing CBG have a mutation of BD (which they term B0) in the homozygous state that encodes for a 
poorly functional CBD synthase; and De Meijer et al. (2009b) selected a variant of this that almost 
completely prevents the conversion of CBG into CBD.
The hypothesis that the enzymes that produce THCA (THCA synthase) and CBDA (CBDA syn-
thase) from the same precursor compound, cannabigerolic acid, are controlled exclusively by two 
alleles of the same gene was challenged recently by Weiblen et al. (2015). They found that THCA 
synthase and CBDA synthase are encoded by two separate but linked regions. THC-predominant 
plants simply have a nonfunctional copy of CBDA synthase, so they convert all cannabigerolic 
acid into THCA. Other evidence also indicates that other genes control the pathways to THCA and 
CBDA (Van Bakel et al. 2011; Onofri et al. 2015).
Shoyama et al. (2001) transferred the THC-synthase gene from Cannabis to a tissue culture of 
tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), inducing it to convert supplied CBGA to THCA. The same research 
group bioengineered the enzyme THCA-synthase into yeast, Pichia pastoris, which also produced 
THCA upon feeding of CBGA (Taura et al. 2007). Subsequently, insect cell cultures and other 
microorganisms have been similarly induced to carry out this final biosynthetic step in THCA 
synthesis (Zirpel et al. 2015). This raises the prospect that transgenic tobacco (or indeed any other 
plant) could be smoked as a marijuana substitute! (Of course, an entire suite of enzymes would be 
required to achieve a total biosynthesis of THC starting from terpenes.)
QUANTITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS IN DIFFERENT PLANT PARTS
This section discusses relative quantitative levels of cannabinoids in different organs of C. sativa, 
i.e., the relative absolute amounts of resin cannabinoids. In most studies, THC has been measured. 
Populations of some cultivars have proven to be rather uniform in THC content, whereas in others, 
considerable variation among plants has been found (Mechtler et al. 2004), although populations 
generally strongly tend to be quite consistent in cannabinoid development.
Cannabinoid levels (concentrations) in the plant generally increase from the seedling stage to 
the flowering stage (Phillips et al. 1970; Latta and Eaton 1975; Turner et al. 1975; Small 1979b; 
Hemphill et al. 1980; Kushima et al. 1980).
Absolute cannabinoid content differs in different parts of the plant, increasing in the following 
order: large stems, smaller stems, older and larger leaves, younger and smaller leaves, and perigo-
nal bracts covering the female flowers (and consequently covering the fruits). Epidermal secretory 
glands are present on all of the preceding structures, and their relative density, coupled with the 
relative size of the resin-containing trichome heads, clearly determines the relative presence of can-
nabinoids in different organs.
The males bear resin glands on their anthers (pollen-containing structures) and filaments (the 
stalks subtending the anthers) and so are associated with cannabinoids (Fairbairn 1972; Dayanandan 
and Kaufman 1976). The female flowers are devoid of resin glands (Small and Naraine 2016a). 
Fetterman et al. (1971) reported that the female flowers tested positive for cannabinoids, but it is 
erroneous to conclude that they actually contain cannabinoids, because the female flowers are 
devoid of secretory glandular trichomes. As detailed in Small and Naraine (2016a), resin heads 
frequently fall off the glandular trichomes of the perigonal bracts and stick to the stigmas, so that 
the female flowers appear to be rich in THC. There are reports of cannabinoids in minute amounts 
in seeds (excluding bracts) and roots, but this is also likely due to contamination, as the resin of the 
plant is easily transferred. THC and other cannabinoids have been reported in the pollen (Paris et al. 
1975; Ross et al. 2005), but once again, this is likely the result of contamination from the secretory 
glands of the anthers (note Figure 11.5).

QUANTITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS 
IN RELATION TO LENGTH OF GROWTH PERIOD
The relative amount of resin or cannabinoids produced increases (whether expressed on a per plant 
basis or area basis) over the vegetative and early flowering periods. Photoperiodic adaptation usually 
determines how long a given race of C. sativa can grow in a particular location and hence how much 
resin (or THC, which is the usual desired cannabinoid) can be harvested. In an indoors, controlled 
environment, trial and error usually is employed to determine precisely how long a marijuana strain 
should be grown to most efficiently produce high-THC material (see discussion in Chapter 14). The 
density of secretory glandular hairs produced on the younger leaves and perigonal bracts and the 
mean maturity of the resin are what determine the quantity of resin or THC at a given time, and 
the objective usually is to identify the stage of maximum production before cannabinoid degrada-
tion becomes significant.
QUANTITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS 
IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Several elementary considerations should be kept in mind in considering quantitative aspects of 
resin production in C. sativa. Bigger plants, generally speaking, produce a larger quantity of resin 
or THC, so factors that make for vigorous, healthy growth contribute to increased production. 
Crowding reduces photosynthetic efficiency, and as with many agricultural plants, trial and error 
has been employed to determine ideal planting densities. The growth and productivity of all plants 
are determined by supplies of essential factors, including light, warmth, water, nutritional elements, 
and CO2—and of course, these necessarily limit the quantity of resin or THC produced. Plants near 
the equator have the luxury of extremely high sunlight, extremely long seasons, and relatively high 
temperatures, and so biotypes of cannabis capable of exploiting these conditions (or comparable 
conditions in a controlled interior environment) can become very large and productive (although not 
necessarily more productive on a time or area basis).
Of all factors determining the relative quantity of resin production in C. sativa, the supply of 
water has been most discussed. The geographical location of hashish production in Asia in areas of 
low atmospheric humidity or rainfall has been advanced as evidence that low atmospheric humid-
ity contributes to increased resin production. Bouquet (1950) pointed out that primarily dry areas 
of Lebanon were devoted to hashish production because they seemed conducive to copious resin 
production, while the western mountainous side of Lebanon was less suitable because of humid 
sea winds. De Faubert Maunder (1976) similarly noted that the copious resin production needed 
for hashish preparation occurred only in a belt of countries from Morocco eastward, including the 
Mediterranean area, Arabia, the Indian subcontinent, and Indo-China, all areas with sparse rainfall 
and low humidity. However, the conclusion that rainfall or atmospheric humidity is causing the 
plants to produce more resin does not follow from these observations. As pointed out in Chapter 12, 
hashish production in Asia requires a dry outdoors environment because moist sticky material can-
not be forced through the fine screens used for manufacturing hashish.
QUANTITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS IN RELATION TO STRESS
Stress makes for smaller plants with less biomass and, hence, a lower overall production of cannabi-
noids per unit area of land occupied. The question arises, however, whether the smaller plants differ 
in relative concentration of cannabinoids (especially THC) on a weight basis. Coffman and Gentner 
observed that smaller plants tended to have higher THC levels. Small et al. (1975) found that plants 
subjected to extreme deficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium were dwarfed (Figure 
3.2) but developed comparable THC concentrations to control plants. Haney and Kutscheid (1973) 
demonstrated that wild hemp populations in Illinois were highest in cannabinoid concentrations 
 

213
Cannabis Chemistry
when stressed, either by nutrient limitations or by drought, although shading did not have any mea-
surable effect. Latta and Eaton (1975) found that Kansas wild hemp tended to produce increased 
percentages of THC in less favorable locations. Sharma (1975) observed greater density of glandular 
trichomes on leaves of C. sativa growing in xeric situations. Murari et al. (1983) noted that fiber cul-
tivars grown in drier continental areas developed higher THC levels than the same cultivars grown 
in a moist maritime region.
The mechanism of how stress affects cannabinoid production is unclear—do stress factors influ-
ence the enzymes controlling the rate of production, do they alter the development of the secretory 
glands, or does stress merely alter the ratio of cannabinoids to other materials constituting the dry 
weight of the tissues? Stress tends to make the plants drop their lower leaves which are naturally low 
in THC, and so it is difficult to evaluate the effects of stress on a whole-plant basis.
QUANTITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS 
IN RELATION TO CHROMOSOME DOUBLING
Doubling chromosome number of plants (usually by treating seeds with the chemical colchicine) 
has had variable results with respect to cannabinoid content. De Pasquale et al. (1979) reported that 
colchicine treatment doubled THC concentration and halved CBD concentration compared to con-
trol plants. However, Bagheri and Mansouri (2015) found that in colchicine-induced tetraploids (i.e., 
with double the normal number of chromosomes), the density of trichomes was reduced and so was 
the concentration of cannabinoids. These authors also noted similar decreases of active chemicals 
accompanying doubling of chromosome number with respect to the essential oil of mint (Mentha 
spicata L.) and the glycosides of purple foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.).
QUALITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS 
IN RELATION TO STAGE OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT
There is very limited evidence that cannabinoids differ qualitatively in different organs (e.g., that 
THC is higher in some organs while CBD is higher in other organs). However, as detailed previ-
ously in this chapter, CBC has been shown to be present in substantial amounts in some seedling 
and juvenile plants and to decline with maturation. Seasonal fluctuations in relative proportion of 
THC and CBD have also been observed (Phillips et al. 1970; Latta and Eaton 1975; Pate 1998a), 
with differences in male and female plants (Turner et al. 1975).
QUALITATIVE VARIATION OF CANNABINOIDS 
IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
nature vs. nurture in the Determination of CannaBinoiDs of Cannabis sativa
In the early twentieth century, the idea became popular that the two principal products for which 
C. sativa is grown (fiber from the stems and intoxicating drugs from the foliage and flowering 
parts) were developed in the plant primarily in response to climate. As (erroneously) expressed 
by Abel (1980): “Depending on the conditions under which it grows, cannabis will either produce 
more resin or more fiber. When raised in hot, dry climates, resin is produced in great quantities 
and fiber quality is poor. In countries with mild, humid weather, less resin is produced and the 
fiber is stronger and more durable. It is because of these climate-related characteristics that most 
Europeans knew very little of the intoxicating properties of the cannabis plant until the nine-
teenth century.” As noted in this book, resin quantity and quality are indeed somewhat modifiable 
by climate and other environmental variables, and the same is true for fiber quantity and qual-
ity. Additionally, the length of season available until days become shorter in the autumn plays a 
large role in plant development. However, the view that natural environmental variables are more 
 

214
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
determinative of the characteristics of the plants than their genetic constitution is quite false and 
indeed rather naïve. It is quite possible to produce considerable high-quality fiber or considerable 
high-quality resin in almost any climate that C. sativa can be raised, provided that the biotype 
grown is suitable.
A more subtle interpretation of the greater importance of environment compared to heredity 
also was also prevalent in the early twentieth century—that environment could induce changes in 
fiber or resin production over a few generations. As (erroneously) expressed, by Bouquet (1950), 
“Secretion of resin does not vary in different varieties of hemp, but depends largely on climatic 
conditions. Non-existent or negligible in Northern Europe, it becomes considerable in the same 
variety of hemp when grown in hot, dry climates” and “hemp cultivated in the plains gradually 
loses the property of supplying active resin.” Similarly Hakim et al. (1986) stated that a low-THC 
English hemp variety when grown in the Sudan over two generations increased its concentration 
of THC. Such reports reflect the view that C. sativa strains suited for fiber production in tem-
perate climates, when transplanted to hot, dry climates, would transform over generations into 
drug cultivars, and vice versa. In essence, this amounts to the rejected theory of “Lamarckian 
inheritance,” which states that environmentally determined characteristics acquired by plants 
or animals can be passed down intergenerationally to their offspring. (Currently, the field of 
epigenetics has raised the possibility that some limited aspects of Lamarckian evolution may be 
valid.) Lamarckian inheritance is often exemplified by the idea that the large muscles acquired 
by a blacksmith pursuing his physically demanding trade would be passed on to his sons (whether 
or not they in turn exercised their muscles). As explained in Chapter 18, maintaining the purity 
of a strain of Cannabis requires stabilizing selection and protection from contaminating pollen, 
and the absence of these probably accounts for observations that Cannabis grown in a foreign 
location seemed to transform remarkably in a few generations. It is clear that although environ-
ment does influence the development of the characteristics of Cannabis, indeed of all organisms, 
strains selected for fiber or marijuana characteristics retain their capacities for such production 
so long as their gene frequencies are maintained. Of course, the ability of Cannabis to change 
genetically as a result of hybridization and selection should not be confused with the concepts of 
the environment directly altering or permanently changing the characteristics of plants.
environmental faCtors influenCing the Qualitative DeveloPment of CannaBinoiDs
Various environmental circumstances can modify, albeit relatively slightly, the qualitative canna-
binoid content of the resin of Cannabis (i.e., relative proportions of given cannabinoids). Factors 
that have been examined include temperature (Bazzaz et al. 1975; Braut-Boucher 1980; Sikora 
et al. 2011), nutrient availability (Haney and Kutscheid 1973; Coffman and Gentner 1975, 1977; 
Bócsa et al. 1997), light intensity (Potter and Duncombe 2012), ultraviolet (UV) light intensity 
(Lydon et al. 1987; Pate 1994), light quality (Mahlberg and Hemphill 1983), and photoperiod 
(Valle et al. 1978). As noted in the previous discussion of cannabinoid development in response 
to stress, there has also been examination of the effects of limitations of water (atmospheric 
humidity or soil water) on content of THC, although interpretation of recorded observations is 
problematical.
Qualitative variation in cannabinoid production seems to be much more influenced by heredity 
than by environment. The range of relative THC concentrations in the resin, developed by popula-
tions of low-THC cultivars (those typically with no more than 0.3% THC) under different environ-
mental circumstances, on the whole is limited, for the most part generally not varying more than 
0.2 percentage points when grown in a range of circumstances, and usually less. The range of rela-
tive THC concentrations in the resin, developed by populations of high-THC strains under different 
circumstances, has not been examined nearly as extensively (because such strains are illicit in most 
countries) but seems to also follow the pattern of not varying greatly when a given strain is raised 
in different situations.

BREEDING FOR HIGH AND LOW LEVELS OF CANNABINOIDS
high-thC strains
THC (Figure 11.12) has been the subject of breeding to increase or decrease content in plants. 
Clandestine marijuana breeders, for several decades, have produced “improved” types of drug 
plants, and hundreds of selections have been named and offered in the illicit trade. Many named 
selections are described in Rosenthal (2001, 2004, 2007, 2010), Snoeijer (2002), Danko (2010), 
Grisswell and Young (2011), Oner (2011, 2012a,b, 2013a,b, 2014), and Backes (2014). Because of 
legal constraints, very few of these appear to possess protected status as accorded by national and 
international agreements governing registered cultivated varieties and intellectual property. In the 
Netherlands, some firms are (or were) authorized to distribute drug selections, and there have been 
some claims for property rights for these. In 1998, a pharmaceutical drug cultivar called Medisins 
was registered in the Netherlands by HortaPharm, one of the earliest officially recognized drug 
cultivars, followed by Grace, registered by GW Pharmaceuticals in 2004, both awarded plant 
breeders rights (Clarke and Merlin 2013). Pharmaceutical varieties developed in the Netherlands by 
HortaPharm BV were transferred to GW Pharmaceuticals, centered in the United Kingdom, which 
has plant breeder’s rights to at least 30 to 40 selections (Anonymous 2006). GW Pharmaceuticals, 
the leading developer of cannabis drugs, is developing strains that predominantly produce one of the 
four major cannabinoid compounds (THC, CBD, CBC, and CBG), as well as varieties with mixed 
cannabinoid or terpene profiles (Clarke and Merlin 2013). Several GW Pharmaceuticals selections 
produce single cannabinoids at very high levels, ranging from over 50% to almost 100%, and one 
clone is cannabinoid-free (De Meijer 2014). Other private firms, especially in the Netherlands, have 
also selected “medicinal” lines with particular cannabinoid profiles as well as other attributes.
low-thC Cultivars
Breeding for low-THC cultivars in Europe has been reviewed by Bredemann et al. (1956), Sokora 
(1979), Bócsa (1998), Bócsa and Karus (1998), and Virovets (1996). Pacifico et al. (2006) were 
unable to detect cannabinoids in some plants of European fiber cultivars (USO-31 and Santhica 23). 
However, at present, no commercial cultivar seems to be 100% free of THC, although Holoborodko 
et al. (2014) point out that some are close to having none. THC content has proven to be more easily 
reduced in monoecious varieties, which are inbred, than in dioecious varieties, which are outbred. 
France has been particularly active in breeding low-THC hemp (Fournier 2000). As a strategic 
economic and political tactic, France has been attempting for several years to have the European 
Union (EU) adopt legislation forbidding the cultivation of industrial hemp cultivars with more than 
0.1% THC, which would mean that primarily French varieties would have to be cultivated in Europe.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
In theory, a simple way of making plants THC-free is to eliminate the capacity to produce any 
kind of cannabinoid. De Meijer et al. (2009b) noted that there are two ways of accomplishing this: 
(1) disrupt the morphogenesis of the glandular trichomes and (2) block one or more biochemical 
pathways crucial for the formulation of the cannabinoids. Gorshkova et al. (1988) reported on plants 
that lacked glandular trichomes and plants with odd glandular trichomes (with white heads), both 
types lacking cannabinoids, but a cultivar or selection in which all plants lack glandular trichomes 
has not been described. De Meijer et al. (2009b), based on selections from a fiber hemp cultivar 
(USO-31), discovered a genetic factor (termed a “knockout gene”) that completely blocks cannabi-
noid biosynthesis in C. sativa, apparently functioning by preventing the conversion of the phenolic 
precursors of the cannabinoids into the cannabinoids.
THC TEST PROTOCOLS FOR INDUSTRIAL HEMP
This section provides information regarding maximum permitted THC limits in licensed cultivated 
hemp plants according to the Canadian and EU regulations, which are more precise than in other 
jurisdictions. Industrial hemp is widely required to have less than 0.3% THC, a criterion first pro-
posed by Small and Cronquist (1976). As noted further in this section, this criterion was lowered to 
0.2% in the EU. In Canada, cultivars demonstrating levels consistently much lower than 0.3% are 
afforded relief from some of the stringent sampling requirements. In the EU, cultivars that meet the 
standard have been eligible for subsidization payments. In both political regions, cultivars that are 
found to regularly exceed the limit are prevented from being cultivated in the future.
Canadian regulations are particularly demanding in terms of how confirmatory measurements 
need to be taken. The procedures require that samples be collected from the upper, reproductive 
parts of the plant (“the entire, fruit-bearing part of the plant shall be used as a sample…normally the 
top one-third of the plant”) when the plants are beginning to produce mature seeds (“when the first 
seeds of 50% of the plants are resistant to compression”). The collection standard calls for screen-
ing the material through a sieve of mesh size 2 mm, which eliminates seeds and all but the smallest 
twigs and essentially represents leaves and floral (perigonal) bracts. In Canada, every grower and 
every cultivar grown (sometimes individual fields) of industrial hemp must be tested for THC con-
tent by an independent laboratory, and under the industrial hemp regulations, fields of hemp with 
more than 0.3% THC may be destroyed. Once a cultivar has established a proven record of develop-
ing less than 0.3% THC, the requirements for testing are reduced. A list of approved cultivars as 
of 2015 is available at http://www.hanfplantage.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LOAC_2015_EN 
_-_Health_Canada_-_List_of_approved_Cultivars_Cannabis_Sativa.pdf. Importation of experi-
mental hemp lines (i.e., other than the approved cultivars) requires special licenses (as well as phy-
tosanitary clearance of imported shipments of seeds by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency), and 
the licenses have to provide an indication that the THC contents are low.
As pointed out by Da Porto et al. (2015), “Only varieties of industrial hemp named in the EU 
Approved Common Catalogue of Cultivars (Regulation EC No 1251/99 and subsequent amendments), 
can be planted in Europe. These cultivars grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2% of Δ9-THC 
(Regulation EC No. 1124/2008), the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant.”
In both Canada and the EU, the methodologies used for analyses and sample collection for THC 
analysis are standardized. Canadian regulations require that one of the several independent laborato-
ries licensed for the purpose conduct the analyses. At least 60 plants need to be sampled. Jurisdictions 
outside of Canada may require 30, 50, or more plants be sampled (usually collectively) to ensure that 
THC levels are low. EU regulations require that 50 plants be sampled for each field, but if the cultivar 
grown developed more than the permitted 0.2% THC the previous year, 200 plants must be sampled.
While there is often variability in THC content among plants of a given provenance, De Meijer 
et al. (1992) found that a sample of 20 provided a reliable approximation of average THC content. 
Mechtler et al. (2004) found that most hemp cultivars produce populations in which the THC level 
is very close in most plants, but occasional ones are significantly divergent.
 

217
Cannabis Chemistry
In the EU, permitted THC levels in hemp were lowered to 0.2% from 0.3% in 2001, and there has 
been continuing lobbying by French hemp companies to lower the level to 0.1% (which would favor 
hemp cultivars of France, since they are typically very low in THC). In Ukraine, the maximum 
THC content allowed for industrial hemp varieties was 0.3% in 1973, 0.2% in 1980, and 0.15% in 
1995. Callaway (2008) provides a critique of THC sampling protocols of the EU.

Chapter 13 provides a guide to key websites dealing with THC test procedures mainly for high-
THC material (for medical marijuana or for law enforcement regarding illicit material). There are 
no legislated limits for cannabinoid content for medical or recreational marijuana, although one can 
contemplate that in the future there may be.
For industrial hemp, the concern is that maximum legislated content of THC not be exceeded in 
plants growing in the fields and often additionally as well in resulting products (especially food). In 
this context, the following websites provide guides to how plant sampling and laboratory measure-
ment of THC should be carried out.

ADAPTIVE PURPOSE OF THE CANNABINOIDS
The natural adaptive functions in C. sativa of the abundant secretory glands, of the large volume of 
resin they produce, and of the cannabinoids in the resin have not been established, although there 
is no shortage of hypothesized explanations. The glands are rich in terpenes, which are very com-
mon in higher plants and are known to be protective against many harmful organisms, so this is 
certainly an important consideration. However, why the plant elaborates some of its terpenes into 
cannabinoids is not clear. Potter (2009) suggested that, consistent with the antioxidant property of 
the cannabinoids, their function might be to prevent oxidation of the monoterpenes present in the 
resin.
There is some evidence that drought, high light intensity, and high elevations (and therefore 
greater UV light) increase the release of exudate on the leaf surfaces, and this has led to the hypoth-
esis that the resin is a protective sunscreen (Bouquet 1950 stated that the resin is an “insulating 
protective varnish” against high temperature and moisture loss). Pate (1983, 1994) hypothesized that 
THC is protective against UV-B radiation and that the much higher THC production in subtropical 
and tropical biotypes in contrast to the much lower production in temperate regions may be the result 
of selection, adapting the more southern races to the high UV-B radiation in the south. However, 
Lydon et al. (1987) concluded that “the contribution of cannabinoids as selective UV-B filters in C. 
sativa is equivocal.” The glands and consequently the resin that is secreted are concentrated on the 
abaxial (“lower”) side of the leaves (the same is true for the perigonal bracts in the inflorescence); it 
hardly makes sense for a sunscreen to be present on the shaded lower side of the foliage rather than 
the exposed upper side, and employing a resinous sunscreen seems quite speculative in view of the 
fact that plants commonly use several other strategies for reducing the intensity of solar radiation 
(see, for example, Small 2014a).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The cannabinoids appear to provide some protection against bacteria (Schultz and Haffner 1959; 
Radosevic et al. 1962; Van Klingeren and Ham 1976) and fungi (Misra and Dixit 1979; Pandey 
1982; McPartland 1984). Cannabis extracts have controlled bacterial and fungal diseases in crops, 
livestock, and humans, as reviewed in McPartland (1997a) and McPartland et al. (2000).
Clarke and Merlin (2015) speculated that the “abscission layer” at the base of the large gland 
heads which contains most of the plant’s cannabinoids, is adaptive in allowing gland heads to fall 
to the ground and release allelopathic constituents to repel competing vegetation. This hypothesis 
was disputed by Small (2015b). As pointed out in Small and Naraine (2016b), about 30% of flow-
ering plants possess glandular trichomes producing secondary chemicals, usually at the tip of the 
structures, often in distinctive head-like containers, and there is an overwhelming majority view 
that these are primarily an adaptation protecting the plants against herbivorous animals, not against 
competing plants. In any case, living plants simply do not drop the resin heads. There is also a tim-
ing problem with Clarke and Merlin’s hypothesis: C. sativa does not produce its inflorescences until 
late summer and early autumn, so it does not have a supply of stalked glands to drop until then. It 
hardly makes sense to schedule allelopathic activity so late in the season, when competing plants 
have completed most of their seasonal growth.
Cannabis sativa has minor allelopathic properties (Inam et al. 1989; McPartland 1997a; 
McPartland et al. 2000), and chemicals leached to the soil may inhibit competing plants, as sug-
gested by Haney and Bazzaz (1970) (also see the discussion of allelopathy in Chapter 3). The foliage 
surface has many small glands, which unlike the much larger capitate glands of the inflorescence, 
do not burst when touched (their function also seems to be to discourage herbivores from eating 
the plant but not to additionally act as flypaper like the large stalked glands in the flowering part). 
Also unlike the larger inflorescence stalked glands, the glandular heads of which fall off with light 
agitation in dried material, the foliage glands of the leaves are extremely difficult to separate and 
remain rigidly attached to desiccated, dead leaves. This likely holds the key to the allelopathic 
nature of C. sativa. Allelopathy is very well known in the plant kingdom, especially as a result of 
toxic chemicals frequently leaching into the soil from the roots or other vegetative parts of the plant. 
Older, senescent foliage of C. sativa characteristically abscises and falls to the ground, and while 
the content of resin in the foliage is very much lower than in the inflorescence (Potter 2009), the 
fallen leaves may contribute some allelopathic protection. In any event, allelopathy of C. sativa is 
not particularly effective, since nearby weeds and grasses are usually superior competitors (unless 
C. sativa has grown large enough to shade out lower plants). Moreover, allelopathy is most effective 
in repelling seedlings, not established plants. Cannabis sativa is an annual and does not become 
large enough in the spring to produce a sufficient volume of resin to have any substantial effect on 
surrounding competing seedlings. (Whether overwintering litter from the plant can affect the next 
year’s growth is another issue.)
Insects are by far the principal herbivores of plants, which employ many chemical defenses 
against them. Curiously, insects lack endocannabinoid receptors (see Chapter 13) and so do not 
respond to the cannabinoids in the same way as most animal groups. However, insects need not con-
sume the resin for it to be repellent. There have been repeated suggestions that exuded resin could 
be a mechanical defense, ensnaring small insects like flypaper (e.g., Ledbetter and Krikorian 1975). 
“Touch-sensitive glandular trichomes” rupture when touched by an arthropod, rapidly releasing a 
sticky exudate, which can discourage, even kill, herbivorous insects (Krings et al. 2002; Figures 
11.13 and 11.14). In living (but not dried) cannabis glands, the resin head readily ruptures when 
touched, suggesting that the released resin is indeed antiherbivorous (Small and Naraine 2016b). 
Potter (2009) noted that the high proportion of monoterpenes in the large inflorescence glandular 
hairs lowers the resin’s viscosity compared to the foliage glandular hairs. Once the large gland 
heads are punctured by insect contact, the contents would more readily spread over the insect sur-
face, and as the monoterpenes volatalise, the result is an increasingly viscous adhesive coating the 
insect. The acidic forms of THC (THCA) can kill insect cells, suggesting that cannabinoids are 
protective against insects, like the terpenes (Taura et al. 2009).
 

219
Cannabis Chemistry
All of the preceding does not provide a definitive answer to the question of why the cannabi-
noids have evolved, an issue that remains open to speculation (indeed, why other species in the 
Cannabaceae have secretory epidermal cells is equally unclear). Most secondary compounds are 
likely (a) metabolic waste products, (b) generalized antibiotics (acting against all harmful classes of 
organisms; see Pate 1994), or (c) evolutionary holdovers from ancestors in which the chemicals were 
adaptive. The cannabinoids probably fall within one or more of these categories.
EXPANDED DEFINITIONS OF CANNABINOIDS
The term “cannabinoids” has been expanded from its original meaning referring only to a unique 
class of compounds synthesized mostly by Cannabis and rarely by a few other plants. Some

FIGURE 11.13 Possible modes of antiherbivorous action of the large stalked glandular trichomes. Left, resin 
secretions from the gland heads act like flypaper to trap a small insect. Right, a larger insect contacting the 
resinous secretions is discouraged by the sticky substance and perhaps also by its odor and taste. Prepared by

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
researchers also include in the term “cannabinoids” (a) chemically synthesized analogues (“syn-
thetic cannabimimetics”; Ashton 2012) and (b) chemicals of quite different structure called “endo-
cannabinoids” (endogenous cannabinoids), found in animals, including humans, which trigger the 
cannabinoid receptors, particularly those that function in neurochemistry, as described in detail in 
Chapter 13. For example, anandamide, the best known of the human body’s natural mimics of THC, 
is functionally much like THC in its effects but is structurally very different (Figure 11.15).
The cannabinoids of the cannabis plant have occasionally been referred to as “classical cannabi-
noids” in contrast to synthetic cannabinoids of different structure, which are termed “nonclassical 
cannabinoids.” Plant-derived cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) collectively (whether from C. sativa 
or other plants) have been referred to as “exocannabinoids,” in contrast to endocannabinoids. The term 
“phytocannabinoids,” which was once restricted to the cannabinoids of Cannabis (Pate 1999), has 
been enlarged by Gertsch et al. (2010) as follows: “any plant-derived natural product capable of either 
directly interacting with cannabinoid receptors or sharing chemical similarity with cannabinoids or 
both.” A range of chemical compounds produced by a range of organisms directly affect the canna-
binoid receptors, for example, benzyl derivatives from the fungus Eurotium repens (Gao et al. 2011). 
Indirect effects on the cannabinoid receptors are illustrated by the pentacyclic triterpene, beta-amyrin, 
produced by Protium—Brazilian resinous trees (Simão da Silva et al. 2011), which inhibits the break-
down of 2-AG (Matos et al. 2013). Very curiously, beta-caryophyllene, a major compound of the essen-
tial oil of C. sativa (and many other plants), directly activates the CB2 receptors (see Chapter 13), 
and thus, C. sativa produces two quite distinctive classes of phytocannabinoids. N-alkyamide in 
echinacea (Echinacea species) has also been shown to directly stimulate the CB2 receptor system.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• According to chemical nomenclature, Δ9-THC is (6aR-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro6,6,9-
trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol. It is easy to see why such enormous names 
require shorter versions. The acronym THC has become universally understood for 
 tetrahydrocannibal, although there are well over a hundred other meanings, such as Texas 
Historical Commission, The History Channel, and Terminal Handling Charge. CBD simi-
larly also has other meanings, particularly “Convention on Biological Diversity.”

• Rothschild and Fairbairn (1980) observed that the ovipositing butterfly Pieris brassicae 
was repelled more by an intoxicating Mexican strain of C. sativa than by a fiber Turkish 
strain, apparently because of the high THC content in the former.
• According to a widely circulated Internet hoax, in the 1990s, a mythical Florida biochem-
ist, Professor Nanofsky, transferred the ability to produce THC into orange trees and cir-
culated seeds of the transgenic “pot orange” in revenge against the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration for some perceived harassment.

12 Nonmedical Drug Usage
This chapter provides a basic account of nonmedical cannabis drug consumption, mostly for rec-
reational enjoyment, occasionally for religious or ritualistic purposes. An understanding of the 
nature of nonmedical usage to alter consciousness is needed to understand the context for employ-
ing Cannabis sativa for the authorized medical purposes documented in Chapter 13 and the recre-
ational possibilities described in Chapter 15. There are hundreds of books providing instructions on 
the (usually illegal) preparation and use of cannabis products. Most of these masquerade as “educa-
tional” works and slyly provide disclaimers that laws should not be contravened. For a period in the 
late twentieth century, law enforcement authorities attempted to prohibit the sale and distribution 
of such volumes, but with an endless supply of articles now on the Web, this has proven futile. The 
fact is, despite the usually illegal status of cannabis, marijuana is being generated and used in huge 
quantities, and society in general has become quite knowledgeable about the subject. However, it is 
also true that a great deal of misinformation is in circulation.
RELIABILITY OF COUNTERCULTURE INFORMATION
Voluminous information on many aspects concerned with the nonmedical use of cannabis is avail-
able in drug counterculture/underground publications, both in print and on the Web. Such works 
typically advocate (explicitly or implicitly) the consumption of restricted (usually proscribed) drugs 
for recreational use and additionally often provide instructions for obtaining, preparing, or using 
such drugs. Most of these publications are authored anonymously or under pseudonyms. Particular 
publications may not be illicit (habitually, phrases like “Do not contravene any local laws!” are 
inserted, tongue-in-cheek); they may not entirely represent the counterculture (usually conceived 
of as representing a minority viewpoint); and they may not be underground (some jurisdictions are 
more permissive with respect to illicit drugs than others, and cannabis books that once could have 
led to prosecution are now being widely printed and circulated by the publishing industry). An 
appreciable proportion of the information in most of these publications is either invalid or seriously 
suspect. On the other hand, some of the content has been compiled as a result of careful observation, 
experimentation and/or inventiveness and is often mentioned in this book.
THE CANNABIS EXPERIENCE
Biphasic EffEcts
Cannabis and some of its constituent cannabinoids can generate “biphasic effects,” a phrase that 
can mean “two phases” but in the case of cannabis refers to different responses: low doses produce 
symptoms or consequences opposite to those resulting from high doses. As noted by Ashton et 
al. (2005), many of the psychological effects of cannabis (particularly of THC) “are biphasic and 
bidirectional, depending on dose, mode of administration, environment, expectation, personality, 
degree of tolerance and other individual factors, as well as time-frame… Thus, acute effects in 
normal subjects can include euphoria or dysphoria, relaxation or anxiety, excitation followed by 
sedation, heightened perception followed by perceptual distortion, and increased motor activity 
followed by incoordination.” The dual nature of cannabis was appreciated in ancient civilizations, 
particularly India and China. For example, the first century AD Chinese classic medical pharma-
copeia Ben Ts’ao pointed out that cannabis was a benign treatment for numerous maladies, “but 

224

when taken in excess it could cause seeing devils” (Mechoulam 1986; Mechoulam and Parker 
2013a).
sEquEncE of psychological impacts
Iversen (2000) recognized four stages or phases of cannabis intoxication: “buzz,” “high,” 
“stoned,” and “come-down.” During the short initial “buzz,” the user may feel lightheaded or 
slightly dizzy, and tingling may occur in the extremities or elsewhere. During the “high,” there 
may be euphoria, exhilaration, and unrestrained behavior such as giggling, laughter, talkative-
ness, and other forms of sociability. When “stoned,” the user usually feels calm, relaxed, and 
happy and may feel as if in a dreamlike state. After several hours, the come-down period occurs, 
marked by diminishment of the sensations. Iverson’s analysis is debatably applicable to most 
people, especially to the effects of certain marijuana strains, but (in common with many drugs, 
including alcohol) conforms to a sort of bell curve of a gradually increasing, peak, and gradually 
decreasing set of reactions.
plEasant psychological EffEcts
Recreational usage of marijuana, for at least the majority of regular consumers, is employed for 
fun (Figure 12.1). It usually produces mild euphoria (a “high”), relaxation, decreased anxiety, 
and reduction of inhibitions. There are often accompanying decreases in abilities to judge time 
and focus intellectually and induction of sleepiness and incoordination, but these symptoms 
are expected in experienced users and may even be welcome. Some sensory perceptions fre-
quently become more intense, and these may include those associated with hunger, sex, music, 
and other pleasurable activities. Marijuana is usually consumed in a group setting (it is said to 
increase sociability), which contributes to the enjoyment of the experience. “Social setting and 
expectations have a great effect on the perceived state of ‘intoxication’ induced by marijuana” 
(Yazulla 2008).

225
Nonmedical Drug Usage
unplEasant psychological symptoms
Because the drug is usually taken in an illegal setting, there may be anxiety or guilt associated with 
the possibility of being exposed. Most users today, however, have limited concerns for the legal sta-
tus or possible harm related to marijuana and do not feel the shame and fear that are frequent with 
other illegal drugs. There is considerable variation in individual reaction, with personality playing 
a significant role, and some, particularly naïve users and those in stressful situations, can experi-
ence anxiety to the level of panic, paranoia, and psychosis (Gregg et al. 1976; Kalant 2001; Hall 
and Pacula 2003). Unpleasant psychological reactions occasionally occur and may include anxiety, 
depressed mood, dizziness, and panic attacks. Psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucina-
tions are rare but more likely at very high doses of THC. High doses can cause dysphoria (a pro-
found state of unease or dissatisfaction), sensory distortion, and even hallucinations. As discussed 
in the next chapter, the particular constituents present in given samples of cannabis can result in 
different psychological effects.
couchlock
“Couchlock” (also couch lock and couch-lock) refers to a state of extreme lethargy (literally to 
the point of being unable to rise from one’s couch) resulting from smoking marijuana. “Zapped,” 
“zonked,” and “zombied” are occasionally terms also employed to indicate profound physical tired-
ness induced by marijuana. Couchlock has often been attributed to the sedative effect of the consid-
erable cannabidiol (CBD) in indica strains but seems to result from a sedative interaction of THC 
and strains high in the terpene myrcene (Russo 2011a). As noted in Chapter 2, myrcene contributes 
to the sedative effect of Humulus, the sister genus of Cannabis.
physiological EffEcts
Short-term noticeable physiological effects may include an increase in heart rate, a decrease in 
blood pressure when standing, dry mouth (“cotton mouth,” “pasties”), lowering of body tempera-
ture, increased oxygen demand, reduced tear flow, reduced bowel movement, and delayed gastric 
emptying (Fišar 2009b).
“Red eye” (redeye, bloodshot eye, or conjunctival vasodilation) is another common effect of 
smoking marijuana (not to be confused with photographic redeye due to reflection of flash light 
from the retina). Red eye is redness of the sclera or white region of the eye (Figure 12.2) due to 
vasodilation of small vessels in the eye or occasionally simply from irritating marijuana smoke. 
Although red eye may result from smoking marijuana, the occurrence of pupil dilation, widely 
thought to occur, has been challenged (Weil et al. 1968; also see the next chapter).

HEALTH RISKS
Although cannabis is an enjoyable diversion for most, there are potential hazards associated with 
nonmedical usage of marijuana. Of course, purchasing material from criminals and exposure to 
prosecution are dangers that can indirectly be harmful psychologically and physically. There is no 
shortage of studies showing harmful psychological and physiological effects of marijuana, but, as 
pointed out in the next chapter, essentially only studies intended to demonstrate negative effects 
of marijuana consumption have been permitted until very recently, and research funding has been 
predicated on documenting the harmfulness of marijuana.
As pointed out in Chapter 13, a range of opinion exists in the medical community regarding 
just how hazardous consumption of marijuana is with respect to causing particular illnesses, just 
as there is a range of opinion with regard to how beneficial medical marijuana is with respect to 
alleviating particular illnesses. As also noted in Chapter 15, the official position of many national 
governments (particularly in North America) is (or at least has been until recently) that herbal mari-
juana is a dangerous “narcotic” with absolutely no valid medical value.
Health risks mentioned in the context of using medical marijuana are discussed in the next 
chapter. Except for the special hazards experienced by patients with weakened immune or cardiac 
systems (examined in the next chapter), the risks of using medical marijuana are essentially the 
same as for healthy people using recreational marijuana. The specific risks associated with smok-
ing, hazardous contaminants, pathogens, pregnancy, and lactation are also discussed in the next 
chapter. The majority of medical associations have issued statements noting the potential harmful-
ness of marijuana and usually also indicating the need for research before it is accepted for medical 
usage. For example, the American Psychiatric Association (2013) revised Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders warns that use of marijuana can progress to “marijuana use disorder,” 
a condition requiring treatment. Kepp and Raich (2014) list the position statements on the use of 
medical marijuana of numerous medical organizations. While most such evaluations are rather 
negative, as detailed in the next chapter, there are quite promising therapeutic applications under 
examination and development. The following comments regarding health risks are pertinent to the 
recreational usage of marijuana.
concErn for mEntal status
There are many publications documenting mental health concerns associated with marijuana, includ-
ing the possibilities of addiction and mental illness (Fernández-Artamendi et al. 2011; Zvolensky 
et al. 2011; Bostwick 2012; Greydanus et al. 2013; Karila et al. 2014; Lev-Ran et al. 2014; Rubino 
and Parolaro 2014; Volkow et al. 2014). Cannabis is extraordinarily attractive to adolescents (Figure 
12.3), and the possible effects on the mental health of the young are the leading health concern 
associated with recreational marijuana. Moore et al. (2007) wrote “there is now sufficient evidence 
to warn young people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness 
later in life.”
Possibly the most human characteristic is our advanced degree of cognition—the brain’s abil-
ity to acquire, store, and later retrieve new information. Numerous studies have concluded that 
marijuana is not completely without serious risk for mental status. “Clearly, the chief psychoactive 
component in cannabis, THC, produces acute cognitive disturbances in humans and animals, more 
profoundly affecting short-term than long-term memory” (Mechoulam and Parker 2013a). Gilman 
et al. (2014) studied the brains of young recreational users ranging in age from 18 to 25 years and 
found “that in young, recreational marijuana users, structural abnormalities in gray matter density, 
volume, and shape of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala can be observed.” Some reports have 
found that chronic marijuana use over several years produces quite significant cognitive impair-
ments; others dispute the validity of these studies (Mechoulam and Parker 2013a). Jager (2012) stated, 
“Taken together, studies on long-term effects of cannabis on cognition have failed to find proof of 
 

227
Nonmedical Drug Usage
gross abnormalities, but there is some evidence for mild cognitive impairments, particularly in the 
domain of memory and learning… The majority of recreational cannabis users does not experience 
serious adverse reactions and is able to regulate their use. However, a minority of frequent or long-
term users will develop problems.”
In a very extensive meta-analysis, Minozzi et al. (2010) stated, “We conclude that there is insuf-
ficient knowledge to determine the level of risk associated with cannabis use in relation to psychotic 
symptoms and that more information is needed on both the risks of cannabis use and the benefits of 
preventive interventions to support evidence-based approaches in this area.” Radhakrishnan et al. 
(2014) concluded that there is danger of precipitating mental illness in those vulnerable to mental 
problems and risk of seriously aggravating mental conditions in those already suffering from men-
tal problems. However, Zammit et al. (2008) were of the view that the degree of risk has not been 
clearly evaluated. A study by Phillips et al. (2002) suggested that marijuana use in a study group 
of patients at risk of developing psychosis did not increase that risk. Ksir and Hart (2016) reviewed 
studies of cannabis and psychosis and concluded that the research “suggests that cannabis does not 
in itself cause a psychosis disorder. Rather, the evidence leads us to conclude that both early use 
and heavy use of cannabis are more likely in individuals with a vulnerability to psychosis.” Clearly, 
there is not a clear consensus on the potential serious harm that marijuana poses to human cognition.

“Addiction” as a term has become less popular in medicine; “dependence” is the preferred term for 
extreme, excessive harmful usage. Nevertheless, severe, chronic dependence is usually called addic-
tion. “Abuse” can be employed to refer to a lesser degree of overuse.
The risk of addiction from cannabis is considerably lower than that of numerous prescribed and 
illegal agents (Grotenhermen and Russo 2002; Guzmán 2003). While the addictive potential of

cannabis is low compared to nicotine, alcohol, and some controlled drugs, there is general agree-
ment that compulsive usage sometimes develops. “Physical dependence” on cannabis has not been 
demonstrated (Gordon et al. 2013), but psychological dependence on cannabis is often accepted as 
a genuine phenomenon (e.g., Norberg et al. 2012). Gardner (2014) stated, “It seems irrefutable that 
cannabis can be considered to be addictive at the human level.”
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American 
Psychiatric Association headquartered in Washington, DC (fifth edition published in 2013), is the 
official analytical system for mental disorders in the United States. The International Classification 
of Diseases published by the World Health Organization (10th edition completed in 1992, 11th edi-
tion due in 2017) is the other major professional manual for mental disorders, although it covers 
all health conditions and is used mainly outside the United States. Both manuals accept “cannabis 
dependence” (cannabis use disorder) as a psychological condition requiring treatment. Budney et al. 
(2007) estimated that 9% of Americans who had ever used cannabis were psychologically depen-
dent on it (cf. Crean et al. 2011). Degenhardt et al. (2013) estimated that on a worldwide basis, the 
figure is 20%.
The International Classification of Diseases (the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, 
health management, and clinical purposes; for details, see the World Health Organization’s web-
site at http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/) provides the following information: “Individuals 
who have cannabis dependence compulsively use the drug but do not usually develop physiological 
dependence, although frequently tolerance to the effects of cannabis has been reported by these 
individuals. Some users also reported withdrawal symptoms, although the symptoms have not usu-
ally been clinically significant. Frequently people with cannabis dependence use very potent can-
nabis over a period of months and sometimes years, and may spend significant time acquiring and 
using the substance. Cannabis dependence often interferes with family, work, school, or recre-
ational activities. Individuals with cannabis dependence may also persist in using this drug although 
knowledge of physical or psychological problems may result.”
The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists 11 criteria 
for cannabis use disorder (cannabis dependence). These include cravings, giving up important 
life activities in order to use cannabis, continuing to use despite adverse physical or psychologi-
cal problems caused or exacerbated by using, tolerance, withdrawal, and persistent unsuccessful 
efforts to quit. The validity of some of the criteria employed to define cannabis abuse has been 
disputed (e.g., Piontek et al. 2011). Clearly, there is subjective judgment associated with crite-
ria based on personal choice to continue an activity that one judges to be pleasant, even if there 
are some unpleasant consequences. Some have argued that there is a “caffeine use disorder,” as 
evidenced by the fact that some of the criteria for cannabis use disorder are analogous to those 
manifested by coffee addicts.
cannaBis WithDraWal synDromE
A “cannabis withdrawal syndrome” is said to occur in frequent users shortly after they quit, the 
symptoms lasting a week or more (Budney and Hughes 2006). The fifth edition of Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists seven symptoms of withdrawal: anger, anxiety, 
depression, loss of appetite, restlessness, sleep difficulties, and physical symptoms that cause 
significant discomfort, including chills, fever, headache, stomach pains, sweats, and tremors. 
Gorelick et al. (2012) noted that the symptoms are often vague. The very existence of the phe-
nomenon of a withdrawal syndrome has not been universally accepted (Jager 2012). It could be 
argued that there is a “caffeine withdrawal syndrome,” as evidenced by the fact that some of 
the symptoms from being denied coffee or other caffeine-laced beverages are the same as those 
described for cannabis withdrawal syndrome. However, several studies have found that ceasing 
usage of marijuana has at least temporary physiological effects (Allsop et al. 2012; Fratta and 
Fattore 2013).
 

229
Nonmedical Drug Usage
marijuana as a “gatEWay Drug”
One of the most frequently cited dangers claimed to be associated with marijuana is that it is a “gate-
way drug,” leading to the use of other more potent and addictive substances of abuse. Marijuana is 
just one of several drugs examined in “stepping-stone” or “stairway” models accounting for pro-
gression of usage of a sequence of more serious drugs (Tarter et al. 2012). Kepp and Raisch (2014) 
assert, “there is considerable evidence that marijuana is a gateway drug to other illicit drugs.” Joy 
et al. (1999) noted that it is not surprising that most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana 
first, simply because it is the most widely used illegal drug and therefore the first one most people 
encounter. But since most drug users employed alcohol and nicotine before using marijuana (and 
indeed mother’s milk before that), it is hardly deductive logic to assume that preceding usage is 
causally linked to subsequent usage. Joy et al. (1999) pointed out that there is no conclusive evidence 
that marijuana is in fact a gateway drug. Morral et al. (2002) stated: “Strong associations between 
marijuana use and initiation of hard drugs are cited in support of the claim that marijuana use per se 
increases youths’ risk of initiating hard drugs (the ‘marijuana gateway’ effect)… Marijuana gateway 
effects may exist. Our results demonstrate, however, that the phenomena used to motivate belief in 
such an effect are consistent with an alternative simple, plausible common-factor model. No gate-
way effect is required to explain them. The common-factor model has implications for evaluating 
marijuana control policies that differ significantly from those supported by the gateway model.” 
Evaluation that marijuana is a gateway drug is difficult as there are various alternative explanations 
possible of observed correlations between marijuana usage and subsequent usage of other drugs 
(Hall and Lynskey 2005; Fergusson et al. 2006; Cleveland and Wiebe 2008). Melberg et al. (2010) 
suggested that there are “two distinct groups; a smaller group of ‘troubled youths’ for whom there 
is a statistically significant gateway effect that more than doubles the hazard of starting to use hard 
drugs and a larger fraction of youths for whom previous cannabis use has less impact.”
concErn for lung function
Pletcher et al. (2012) conducted a large-scale study of the harm of smoking marijuana upon lung 
function, and concluded that “Occasional and low cumulative marijuana use was not associated with 
adverse effects on pulmonary function.” However, in the main, the medical profession has a very 
negative view of how smoking marijuana influences breathing. The American Lung Association 
(2015) issued the following statement: “Smoke from marijuana combustion has been shown to con-
tain many of the same toxins, irritants and carcinogens as tobacco smoke… Marijuana smokers 
tend to inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than cigarette smokers, which leads to a 
greater exposure per breath to tar. Secondhand marijuana smoke contains many of the same toxins 
and carcinogens found in directly inhaled marijuana smoke, in similar amounts if not more. While 
there is no data on the health consequences of breathing secondhand marijuana smoke, there is con-
cern that it could cause harmful health effects, especially among vulnerable children in the home. 
Additional research on the health effects of secondhand marijuana smoke is needed. Smoking mari-
juana clearly damages the human lung. Research shows that smoking marijuana causes chronic 
bronchitis and marijuana smoke has been shown to injure the cell linings of the large airways, 
which could explain why smoking marijuana leads to symptoms such as chronic cough, phlegm 
production, wheeze and acute bronchitis… Smoking marijuana hurts the lungs’ first line of defense 
against infection by killing cells that help remove dust and germs as well as causing more mucus 
to be formed. In addition, it also suppresses the immune system. These effects could lead to an 
increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections among marijuana smokers, although there is no 
clear evidence of such actual infections being more common among marijuana smokers. However, 
frequent marijuana-only smokers have more healthcare visits for respiratory conditions compared 
to nonsmokers. Studies have shown that smoking marijuana may increase the risk of opportunistic 
infections among those who are HIV positive, although it does not seem to effect the development

of AIDS or lower white cell counts. Another potential threat to those with weakened immune sys-
tems is Aspergillus, a mold that can cause lung disorders. It can grow on marijuana, which if then 
smoked exposes the lungs to this fungus. However, it rarely causes problems in people with healthy 
immune systems.” For additional information regarding the risks from Aspergillus, see the section 
“Microbiological Safety and Sterilization” in Chapter 14.
One of the least discussed risks associated with smoking marijuana is the unsanitary but wide-
spread practice of sharing joints and bongs and the possibility of acquiring diseases such as hepa-
titis. It has been hypothesized that communal smoking could be one of the factors responsible for 
transmitting the human papilloma virus, linked to cancers of the throat and tongue (Zwenger 2009). 
Smoking marijuana has been alleged to have an inhibitory effect on the immune system, which 
could predispose users to infectious diseases. There are scattered case reports of Aspergillus infec-
tion in immunocompromised patients and even meningitis from passed joints. However, doses that 
are capable of producing immunosuppression in rodents are 50–100 times higher than usual human 
doses (Ethan Russo, personal communication).

Euphoric drugs can be used for good or evil, but the harm that can result is not limited to physical 
and/or psychological damage to the individual user (Figure 12.4). Opium use was once so wide-
spread in China that a substantial portion of the population became nonproductive, and a burden 
on the state. The same situation prevails today for khat (Catha edulis L.) usage in some parts of the

Middle East (Small 2004). Indeed, most proscribed illicit drugs harm not just the users but also are 
threats to the financial and physical welfare of many others. Alcohol and tobacco are obvious exam-
ples of legal (albeit controlled) harmful drugs that represent huge burdens on society. The same is 
true for sucrose (common table sugar) and other psychologically addictive foods that contribute to 
the obesity epidemic. The discussion of harmful effects of nonmedical uses of marijuana in this 
chapter is restricted to individual health, but it is well to remember that there are also potential 
effects on the collective welfare of society.
Driving risks
Cannabis is a central nervous system depressant, and in some respects, the acute effects (i.e., at 
high dosages) resemble those of alcohol and other central nervous depressants. Cannabis can pro-
duce drowsiness, slower reactions, decreased memory (Figure 12.5), decreased attention, poorer 
psychomotor task performance, and poorer performance in driving. Asbridge et al. (2012) and Li 
et al. (2012) concluded that the risk of involvement in a motor vehicle accident increases approxi-
mately twofold after acute cannabis smoking. However, very experienced users seem able to com-
pensate substantially, apparently tolerating the drug’s actions well (Hart et al. 2001). Marijuana 
users operating vehicles seem to be less aggressive and more cautious than drunk drivers (Smiley 
1999). (A joke that comes to mind: “A drunk driver will run a stop sign, a high driver will stop 
and wait for it to turn green.”) Some of the impairment caused by cannabis is mitigated, since 
subjects appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired. Where they can compensate, they do, 
for example, by not overtaking, by slowing down, and by focusing their attention when they know 
a response will be required (Grotenhermen 2007). Experienced users appear able to develop 
physiological tolerance to the drug, substantially retaining driving ability (Grotenhermen and 
Müller-Vahl 2012). The combination of marijuana and alcohol or several illegal drugs is additive 
or synergistic, considerably increasing the risks associated with driving under the influence of 
drugs. Neavyn et al. (2014) recommended that users refrain from driving for 8 hours following a 
“high.”
Hartman and Huestis (2013) reviewed the current literature on cannabis effects on driving and 
concluded, “drivers attempt to compensate by driving more slowly after smoking cannabis, but 
control deteriorates with increasing task complexity. Cannabis smoking increases lane weaving 
and impaired cognitive function. Critical-tracking tests, reaction times, divided-attention tasks, and 
lane-position variability all show cannabis-induced impairment. Despite purported tolerance in

frequent smokers, complex tasks still show impairment. Combining cannabis with alcohol enhances 
impairment, especially lane weaving.”
Similarly, Sewell et al. (2009) concluded: “Marijuana smokers tend to compensate effectively while 
driving by utilizing a variety of behavioral strategies. Combining marijuana with alcohol eliminates 
the ability to use such strategies effectively, however, and results in impairment even at doses which 
would be insignificant were they of either drug alone. Epidemiological studies have been inconclusive 
regarding whether cannabis use causes an increased risk of accidents; in contrast, unanimity exists 
that alcohol use increases crash risk. Furthermore, the risk from driving under the influence of both 
alcohol and cannabis is greater than the risk of driving under the influence of either alone.”
Whitehill et al. (2014) noted (for the United States): “The issue of marijuana-impaired driving 
is particularly salient for young drivers, for whom the combination of inexperience and substance 
use elevates crash risk. Youth younger than 21 are at the highest risk of involvement in a fatal 
motor vehicle crash. They are also the age group most likely to use marijuana. Nationally, cannabis 
was involved in 12% of fatal crashes among 16–20 year olds. College students are a population at 
increased risk of substance-related risk behaviors, such as impaired driving… Marijuana is second 
only to alcohol for substances most abused by this population… Findings of previous studies sug-
gest that male students are twice as likely as female students to drive while high on marijuana and 
20% more likely to ride with a marijuana-using driver.”
risk of contamination anD aDultEration of strEEt marijuana
The quality of cannabis drugs purchased in the illicit market is often uncertain, and this is one of 
the chief reasons that many grow and prepare their own supplies. Although sometimes a harmless 
substance is sold as marijuana, often the consumer is offered a product that is significantly more 
harmful that medical-grade forms of the drug.
Herbal marijuana may be contaminated as a result of negligent cultivation, preparation, or stor-
age techniques. As discussed in Chapter 13, this can introduce dangerous fungi, aflatoxins (toxic 
fungal metabolites), other microbes (particularly bacteria), pesticide residues, and heavy metals. 
Law enforcement in some countries has employed Paraquat herbicide to control illicit marijuana, 
notably in Mexico (Figure 12.13b), and there has been concern that imported marijuana could be 
contaminated (Landrigan et al. 1983). However, according to Barceloux (2012), “the high combus-
tion temperatures in marijuana cigarettes destroys Paraquat; therefore there is no significant risk 
of Paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis from cannabis smoking.” Illicit growers sometimes have 
little concern about the health risks of their customers and can produce chemically contaminated 
marijuana. They may use banned plant growth regulators to force early flowering and production 
of bigger more compact buds, such as paclobutrazol, or daminozide (Alar) which degrades into the 
dangerous chemical hydrazine (Upton et al. 2013). So-called “growth enhancers” whose chemical 
nature is uncertain may also have been employed. Sullivan et al. (2013) examined how the presence 
in marijuana of three commonly employed pesticides, bifenthrin, diazinon, and permethrin, as well 
as the plant growth regulator paclobutrazol, produced contaminants in the resulting inhaled smoke. 
Recovered residues were as high as 70%, “suggesting that the potential of pesticide and chemical 
residue exposures to cannabis users is substantial and may pose a significant toxicological threat.” 
Hair (from humans or pets), although not particularly hazardous, is commonly found on street mari-
juana, reflecting the sloppiness of many illicit marijuana producers and sellers.
Solvent extracts (“hash oil,” discussed later) can be contaminated with dangerous chemical resi-
dues. “Synthetic” or “fake” marijuana, discussed in Chapter 13, and chemically synthesized ana-
logues of THC are usually quite hazardous products.
Adulteration refers to the deliberate inclusion of inferior materials in a product in order to mis-
lead the purchaser into thinking that the quantity or quality is superior. A chief motivation for this is 
to make the appearance more attractive and/or to increase the weight. Adding sand, chalk particles, 
or tiny glass shards can make marijuana appear to have more of the desirable glistening trichome 
 

233
Nonmedical Drug Usage
gland heads as well as increase the density. In the United Kingdom during the Victorian era, lead 
was a common adulterant, used for example to color cheese. Because street marijuana is sold by 
weight, some unscrupulous dealers have added lead particles to their offerings, resulting in poison-
ing consumers (Busse et al. 2008a,b). Especially dangerous is the practice of some dealers of adding 
dangerous drugs or plants to marijuana (McPartland 2008b; Upton et al. 2013).
risk of ExposurE to inDoor groW-op EnvironmEnts
Martyny et al. (2013) examined the environmental dangers to law enforcement personnel of enter-
ing illegal indoor marijuana growing operations. They did not find hazardous levels of volatile 
organic compounds, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and common chemicals utilized by illicit 
growers, primarily pesticides and fertilizers, and none of these showed high toxicity. Airborne fun-
gal spores, however, were of significant concern, and it was noted that “removal of the marijuana 
plants could potentially expose responders to levels of exposure consistent with those associated 
with mold remediation processes and that respiratory protection is advisable.”
RISK TO DOGS
Man’s best friend is in special danger from cannabis (Figure 12.6). The American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Animal Poison Control Center reported that dogs account for 96% 
of their marijuana toxicity cases (Donaldson 2002). Ingestion of baked goods made with cannabis 
has resulted in sickness, even death of canines, which seem especially prone to being poisoned. 
Fitzgerald et al. (2013) reported that “The minimum lethal oral dose for dogs for THC is more than 
3 g/kg. Although the drug has a high margin of safety, deaths have been seen after ingestion of food 
products containing the more concentrated medical-grade THC butter.” (This report, based in part 
on a study of dogs dying from being tube-fed a large bolus of material causing aspiration and respi-
ratory arrest, appears erroneous with respect to marijuana directly causing death in dogs. As CB1 
receptors are practically absent from the brain stem cardiorespiratory drive nuclei, true overdoses

have not been reported.) Meola et al. (2012) provided the following information: “Toxicosis in dogs 
can be caused by inhalation of the smoke, direct ingestion of the leaves, seeds, stems and flowers 
of the plant, ingestion of products laced with marijuana leaves, or ingestion of products made with 
concentrated THC or hashish oil. Clinical signs may be seen within 30–60 minutes after ingestion 
of marijuana. THC toxicosis in dogs can cause considerable morbidity. The most common reported 
clinical signs of marijuana toxicosis in dogs include central nervous system depression, ataxia [loss 
of control of bodily movements], mydriasis [pupil dilation], increased sensitivity to motion or sound, 
hyperesthesia [increased sensitivity to stimulation], especially ptyalism [excessive salivation], trem-
ors, and the acute onset of urinary incontinence.” A case of dermatitis in a dog resulting from mov-
ing into a residence that was previously used as a marijuana grow house was documented by Evans 
(1989).
THE GREAT DEBATE: IS CANNABIS RELATIVELY HARMFUL OR BENIGN?
Society has ferociously debated the merits of many scientific issues historically, such as biological 
evolution and vaccination, and such contentious debates continue to this day, exemplified by climate 
change and the comparative benefits of fad diets. Some debates are so esoteric and complex that 
they cannot be decided to the universal satisfaction of everyone (Figure 12.7), but in the fullness of 
time, disagreements concerning scientific facts can usually be settled. However, the debate concern-
ing psychoactive cannabis (whether recreational or medicinal) is multifaceted, involving examina-
tion of not only its merits and risks in many independent respects but also human values concerning 
personal liberty and choice. It is easy to conclude when observing some debates (especially between 
politicians) that one or both parties are dishonest, foolish, deluded, prejudiced, and lacking in objec-
tivity. As noted in this book, scientific methodology (at its best) controls these human weaknesses—
but it is not possible to completely remove the human element from science, and particularly when 
scientific facts are not entirely clear, it is not surprising that there are very different perspectives. 
The following quotations representing such different perspectives of cannabis are intended simply 
to illustrate this phenomenon, not to summarize the best evidence or arguments, which are detailed

elsewhere (especially in Chapter 13). As reflected by the predominance of negative views of the 
harmfulness of recreational marijuana, the professional literature is overwhelmingly dominated 
by those who regard marijuana as significantly harmful. A more balanced view (i.e., both for and 
against) is found in the media at large, but this book is most concerned with the views of informed 
individuals.
rEprEsEntativE viEWpoints that cannaBis is rElativEly harmful
Hall and Degenhardt (2009) concluded, “The most probable adverse effects include a dependence 
syndrome, increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, impaired respiratory function, cardiovascular 
disease, and adverse effects of regular use on adolescent psychosocial development and mental 
health.” Reece (2009) stated, “Chronic cannabis use is associated with psychiatric, respiratory, 
cardiovascular and bone effects. It also has oncogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic effects” (as dis-
cussed elsewhere, the contentions in the latter sentence are disputed). Hoch et al. (2015) concluded, 
“Various medical conditions can arise acutely after cannabis use, depending on the user’s age, 
dose, frequency, mode and situation of use, and individual disposition; these include panic attacks, 
psychotic symptoms, deficient attention, impaired concentration, motor incoordination, and nausea. 
In particular, intense use of high doses of cannabis over many years, and the initiation of cannabis 
use in adolescence, can be associated with substance dependence, specific withdrawal symptoms, 
cognitive impairment, affective disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, and physical disease outside 
the brain (mainly respiratory and cardiovascular conditions).”
Hall (2014) concluded that chronic (long-term regular) recreational use is associated with the 
following hazards:
• Risk of developing a dependence syndrome (1 in 10 of all marijuana users, 1 in 6 of those 
starting in adolescence).
• Doubled risk of psychotic symptoms and disorders, especially with a personal or family 
history of psychotic disorders, and when use started in the mid-teens.
• Lower educational attainment by those beginning use as adolescents (causal link not 
established).
• Increased use of other illicit drugs by adolescent users (causal link not established).
• Intellectual impairment when use begins in adolescence and continues through young 
adulthood (reversibility of the impairment is unclear).
• Double the risk of schizophrenia or psychotic symptoms in adulthood when use begins in 
adolescence.
• Increased risk of chronic bronchitis.
• Probable increased risk of myocardial infarction from smoking in middle age.
Thompson and Koenen (2011) issued the following warning: “Predictable side effects of mari-
juana use include impaired judgment, cognitive impairment, impaired driving ability, hallucina-
tions, early onset of psychosis in certain individuals, memory impairment, worsening of mood 
and anxiety disorders, and the risk of dependence. Individuals with major mental illnesses are 
especially vulnerable to the deleterious effects of cannabis. Smoking marijuana includes risks of 
rapid onset of intoxication as well as exposure to a variety of toxic and carcinogenic combustible 
products. Vaporization reduces exposure to some potential toxins such as carbon monoxide, but is 
unable to remove aluminum, ammonia, acetaldehyde, and other substances.”
Hasin et al. (2015) concluded that in 2012–2013, 9.5% of U.S. adults (about 22 million) used 
marijuana in the past year, and nearly 3 of every 10 had a diagnosis of a marijuana use disorder. 
They also commented: “studies have shown that use or early use of marijuana is associated with 
increased risk for many outcomes, including cognitive decline, psychosocial impairments, vehi-
cle crashes, emergency department visits, psychiatric symptoms, poor quality of life, use of other 
 

236

drugs, a cannabis-withdrawal syndrome, and addiction risk. Further, marijuana use disorders (abuse 
or dependence) are associated with substantial comorbidity and disability and are consequently of 
substantial public health concern.” (See Meier et al. 2015 for a discussion of the difficulties of con-
cluding that marijuana use among teenagers leads to permanent damage.)
Zeisser et al. (2012) stated: “Chronic cannabis use, generally referred to as a pattern that entails 
weekly or more frequent use, has been associated with an increased likelihood of cannabis depen-
dence, chronic bronchitis and impaired respiratory function, psychotic disorders and impaired 
cognitive functioning as well as psychosocial effects such as impaired educational attainment in 
adolescents, and an increased likelihood of using other illicit drugs. Individuals who use cannabis 
may also experience acute adverse effects such as anxiety and panic, and an increased risk of motor 
vehicle crashes.”
rEprEsEntativE viEWpoints that cannaBis is rElativEly BEnign
Van Ours and Williams (2012) concluded: “Widespread use reflects the common belief that can-
nabis is not a particularly harmful drug. The weight of evidence supports this belief…the harms 
associated with cannabis use are much less serious than those associated with ‘hard’ drugs such as 
cocaine or heroin and may even be smaller than those associated with alcohol and cigarettes. And 
while it is generally acknowledged that there are risks associated with long term heavy use of can-
nabis such as respiratory diseases, cancer and perhaps psychotic disorders, only a small fraction of 
those who ever use cannabis actually become long term heavy users…for those who are not long 
term heavy users of cannabis, the physical and mental health effects of their cannabis use are likely 
to be small.” (See comments in the next chapter regarding cancer risk from smoking.)
Nathan (2013) stated: “I am a father who worries about my kids getting sidetracked by canna-
bis before their brains have a chance to develop. But I am also a physician who understands that 
the negative legal consequences of marijuana use are far worse than the medical consequences… 
Alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, caffeine and refined sugar are among the most commonly used, poten-
tially habit-forming recreational substances. All are best left out of our daily diets. Only marijuana 
is illegal, though alcohol and tobacco are clearly more harmful. In several respects, even sugar 
poses more of a threat to our nation’s health than pot… If you still believe that cannabis should be 
illegal, then you must logically support the criminalization of alcohol and tobacco, with vigorous 
prosecution and even imprisonment of producers and consumers. Does that sound ridiculous? Then 
you must conclude that the only rational approach to cannabis is to legalize, regulate and tax it.”
Graham (2014) wrote: “For proponents of the legalization of marijuana…legalizing pot means 
the market will be regulated, governments will reap the tax revenue, and drastically fewer people 
will be mired in the violence of the drug war and the injustices of the legal system. If public health 
suffers a bit as use of the substance increases, so be it… But what if the rise in marijuana smoking 
prompted by legalization brings more than just tolerable negative side effects? What if it is actually 
good for public health? A growing body of research suggests that marijuana may replace alcohol 
or hard drugs in many people’s lives. Other recent studies suggest that looser restrictions on weed 
decrease traffic fatalities and even the suicide rate. That means the rising tide of legalization may 
mean more than just an acceptable but unfortunate societal burden—it may be a boon to public 
health.”
The New York Times Editorial Board (2014) concluded: “It took 13 years for the United States 
to come to its senses and end Prohibition, 13 years in which people kept drinking, otherwise law-
abiding citizens became criminals and crime syndicates arose and flourished. It has been more than 
40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana, inflicting great harm on society just to 
prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol. The federal government should repeal the ban 
on marijuana… There are no perfect answers to people’s legitimate concerns about marijuana use. 
But neither are there such answers about tobacco or alcohol, and we believe that on every level—
health effects, the impact on society and law-and-order issues—the balance falls squarely on the 
 

237

side of national legalization. The social costs of the marijuana laws are vast. There were 658,000 
arrests for marijuana possession in 2012, according to F.B.I. figures, compared with 256,000 for 
cocaine, heroin and their derivatives. Even worse, the result is racist, falling disproportionately on 
young black men, ruining their lives and creating new generations of career criminals. There is hon-
est debate among scientists about the health effects of marijuana, but we believe that the evidence 
is overwhelming that addiction and dependence are relatively minor problems, especially compared 
with alcohol and tobacco. Moderate use of marijuana does not appear to pose a risk for otherwise 
healthy adults. Claims that marijuana is a gateway to more dangerous drugs are as fanciful as the 
‘Reefer Madness’ images of murder, rape and suicide. There are legitimate concerns about mari-
juana on the development of adolescent brains. For that reason, we advocate the prohibition of sales 
to people under 21.”
GLOBAL USAGE OF MARIJUANA
According to United Nations (2014): “In 2012, between 125 million and 227 million people were 
estimated to have used cannabis, corresponding to between 2.7 and 4.9 per cent of the popula-
tion aged 15–64 years. West and Central Africa, North America, Oceania and, to a lesser extent, 
Western and Central Europe remain the regions with prevalence rates considerably higher than 
the global average. Over the past five years in North America, the largest cannabis herb market, 
prevalence rates have followed an upward trend.” Cannabis users account for 80% of the illicit drug 
users in the world (Van Ours and Williams 2012). An analysis of consumption patterns and trends 
in Europe is provided by EMCDDA (2008, 2012). Estimates for the United States, the leader in 
usage, range up to 25% of the population. Marijuana has been claimed to be at least the fourth most 
valuable crop in America, outranked only by corn, soybeans, and hay (Small and Marcus 2002). As 
noted in Chapter 15, some authors claim that marijuana is the leading cash crop in the United States.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF NONMEDICAL PSYCHOTROPIC 
USAGE OF CANNABIS DRUGS
Natural drugs have been employed historically for three discernible purposes: spiritually or reli-
giously, therapeutically, and recreationally as a euphoric. This chapter is mainly concerned with 
recreational and spiritual usage, and historical aspects related to medicinal usage are discussed in 
the next chapter. It is often difficult, perhaps impossible, to distinguish the three usages in ancient 
times because natural drugs were often utilized for more than one of these goals at the same time. 
The earliest recorded reference to euphoric use of C. sativa appears to date to about 5000 years ago, 
associated with Kurgan culture (the Kurgans were early people of the Caucasus region, known for 
elaborate burials mounds). A smoking cup with remnants of charred hemp seeds, associated with 
the Kurgans, who occupied Romania at that time, is suggestive of the flowering parts of C. sativa 
being combusted perhaps for euphoric ritualistic purposes. Kurgan incense burners have been 
hypothesized to have had the same function. It is speculative whether these early usages of cannabis 
actually were intended to produce intoxication, but it does seem that cannabis was used ritualisti-
cally in the Black Sea–Caucasus region (Sherratt 1991). The Scythians, noted next in this context, 
exemplify this tradition particularly well, and it seems that cannabis was also used for sacred pur-
poses in Assyria, Babylon, and ancient Palestine (Rubin and Comitas 1975).
The ancient region of Scythia included a large area from the Ukraine to the borders of present-
day India. The Scythians included nomadic Caucasoid tribes, wandering to the borders of modern 
Russia and China. Scythian culture thrived from the ninth to the third centuries BC. The fifth cen-
tury BC Greek historian Herodotus described a Scythian funeral ceremony in which vapors from 
burning cannabis seeds (possibly entire fruiting heads, which could contain appreciable THC) were 
inhaled in small tents (Figure 12.8). Merlin (1972) provided Herodotus’ account: “The Scythians 
then take this seed of hemp and, creeping under the mats, they throw it on the red-hot stones; and, 
 

238
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
being so thrown, it smolders and sends forth so much steam that no Greek vapor bath could surpass 
it. The Scythians howl in their joy at the vapor bath.” Rudenko (1970) found archaeological evi-
dence of a metal tripod censer with remnants of hemp seeds that Scythians of southern Central Asia 
had apparently employed during funeral rites. While the Scythian records have been interpreted 
as usage of marijuana to induce intoxication, this is uncertain. Plant materials are often burned 
ritualistically by various cultures without motivation to alter mental state. Nevertheless, in a rather 
reminiscent old practice in Poland, Russia, and Lithuania, hemp seeds were thrown on hot stones 
and the vapors inhaled in order to alleviate toothache (Benet 1975), suggesting relief of psychic 
stress as typically is induced by inebriants.
Practitioners of Buddhism and Shintoism historically often employed cordage or fabric made of 
hemp for ceremonial purposes (Olson 1997; Figure 12.11c), although this is not reflective of intoxi-
cant usage. As late as the nineteenth century, there were cults and sects worshipping C. sativa in 
Africa (Benet 1975). Williams-Garcia (1975) described ritual usage of cannabis by an Indian tribal 
group in Mexico.
Touw (1981) reviewed evidence of shamanistic use in ancient China and suggested that the psy-
chotropic properties of cannabis may have been known as early as five millennia ago there. Jiang 
et al. (2006) and Russo et al. (2008) documented a 2700-year-old grave, the Yanghai Tombs near 
Turpan, China, in which remains of apparently high-THC cannabis were detected, suggesting a pos-
sible ritualistic psychotropic purpose. (The DNA of this material was examined by Mukherjee et al. 
2008, although the analysis is unclear with regard to relationships with modern varieties.)
Zoroastrianism, a monotheistic religion of Iran, was founded by the Prophet Zoroaster in 
ancient Persia approximately 3500 years ago and is still practiced by about three million devotees. 
Cannabis intoxication appears to have been a central activity in early Zoroastrian shamanic ecstasy 
(Mechoulam 1986).
Over the last millennium, cannabis consumption became more firmly entrenched in southern 
Asia from Afghanistan to India, than anywhere else in the world, both for medical and cultural 
purposes, some of which involved consumption of cannabis as an inebriant. Cannabis became

intimately associated with religions of southern Asia (Aldrich 1977), and its sacred use in India 
predates written records (Hasan 1975). Not surprisingly, highly domesticated drug land races were 
selected there.
While Cannabis has been extensively used as an inebriating and medicinal drug for thousands 
of years in southern Asia and subsequently in the Near East (Figure 12.9), parts of Africa, and other 
Old World areas, widespread drug use simply did not develop in temperate region countries, where 
by contrast fiber hemp was raised. After the French war in Egypt and Syria (1798–1801), return-
ing Napoleonic soldiers brought back knowledge of cannabis usage to France. Similarly, British 
physicians returning from India also introduced the intoxicant use of cannabis drugs to their home-
land (see Chapter 13). In due course, the recreational use of cannabis became popular in Europe 
among intellectuals, who assembled in small “hashish clubs” in the nineteenth century. Most infa-
mous of these was the “Club des Hashischins” of Paris (Figure 12.10), established around 1835, 
with monthly meetings in a hotel. The participants experimented with hashish and other drugs and 
included such famous French literary figures as Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, Alexandre 
Dumas, Théophile Gautier, and Victor Hugo.
The use of cannabis for recreational, spiritual, and medicinal purposes was probably imported 
into the Americas by African slaves as early as the sixteenth century, becoming established in early 
times among low-income rural groups in South America. By the late nineteenth century, recre-
ational marijuana usage had migrated to Mexico and the southern United States, where it remained 
a stigmatized drug associated with the poor and underprivileged, particularly with Hispanics and 
Blacks.
The use of Cannabis as a recreational inebriant in sophisticated, largely urban settings began 
substantially in the latter half of the twentieth century. In the 1960s, “hippies” made pilgrimages 
to Asia in search of enlightenment and established what came to be known as the “hippie trail” or 
“hashish trail” extending across Eurasia. Up until then, drug preparations of Cannabis were used 
predominantly as a recreational intoxicant in poor countries and the lower socioeconomic classes 
of developed nations. In the late 1960s, marijuana became associated with the rise of a hedonistic, 
psychedelic ethos, first among college students in the United States (Abel 1980; Booth 2004) and

eventually over much of the world, with the consequent development of a huge international illicit 
market.
Tarter et al. (2012) noted that in the United States, “Policies aimed at curtailing substance use 
have been largely guided by ideology and political expediency effected primarily through the 
criminal justice system. The Eighteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Volstead 
Act banning manufacture, transport and selling of alcohol beverages between 1919 and 1933, for 
example, culminated a long struggle spearheaded by the Anti-Saloon League, Prohibition Party, 
and Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Similarly, the first Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Narcotics, Harry J. Anslinger, demonized marijuana for primarily political reasons, namely to bol-
ster the visibility, prestige and budget of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.” Cultivation, commerce, 
and consumption of drug preparations of Cannabis were also proscribed in most other countries 
during the twentieth century, but cannabis continues to contribute substantially to the current illicit 
drug problems of the world.
MODERN SPIRITUAL USAGE OF CANNABIS
Despite the extensive historical usage of cannabis for ritualistic purposes described previously, 
there is limited employment of marijuana today for religious usage. Information on Indian, par-
ticularly Hindu, religious usage of cannabis is presented in Bey and Zug (2004). Hindu devotees 
of Shiva believe that cannabis pleases this god (Acharya et al. 2014). Some Sikh festivals employ 
cannabis. Sufism has long employed cannabis. Of all current religious traditions, Rastafarianism 
in Jamaica is most associated with the use of marijuana, attributing divine power to the drug 
(Beaubrun 1983). Some American cults (an example is shown in Figure 12.11a and b) have taken 
the position that their use of cannabis is exempt from drug laws, but their claims have been 
rejected by courts. It should be kept in mind that a considerable amount of spiritual usage of 
cannabis was once concerned with the ritualistic use of hemp, not marijuana, as illustrated in 
Figure 12.11c.

CANNABIPHOBIA AND THE CULTURAL WAR ON MARIJUANA
During the early part of the twentieth century, marijuana was savagely villainized as a drug leading 
to extreme physical and mental degeneration (Figure 12.12). In particular, the 1936 American cult 
film Reefer Madness propagandized the evils of marijuana (described as “the plant with its roots 
in hell”) in such an exaggerated and alarmist fashion—portraying users as homicidally depraved 
raving lunatics—that today it seems ridiculous. Nevertheless, since the latter half of the twentieth 
century and lasting until the present, marijuana has been a principal target of the “war on drugs” as 
declared in the United States by the Nixon administration but waged throughout the Western World. 
The use of cannabis was widely claimed to be associated with sexual permissiveness, dropping out 
of productive society, and a breakdown of culture and conventional morals. Young marijuana users 
were accused of developing an “amotivational syndrome,” causing them to become alienated and 
unproductive, and cannabis was said to be a “gateway” inducement to harder drugs. Law enforce-
ment has dedicated huge efforts to eradicating illicit material (Figure 12.13) and prosecuting and 
jailing millions of users.
GROWING PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF MARIJUANA
Despite substantial continuing condemnation of the use of marijuana, much of the public in Western 
nations has become tolerant or sympathetic to it. As pointed out by Leggett (2006):
“A sizeable share of the population in the world has experimented with cannabis and not 
experienced dramatic negative repercussions. It is widely understood that, unlike other drugs, 
one cannot die of a cannabis overdose and few people develop cannabis habits that force them 
into street crime or prostitution. Cannabis is not associated with violent behavior in many coun-
tries and its role in accidents is vague in the public mind. The stereotypical ‘stoner’ character 
has become celebrated in the popular media as harmless and somewhat endearing. Claims of 
purported medical benefits of cannabis have created the impression that cannabis is not only vir-
tually harmless but that it can actually be beneficial to health.” (See Graham 2014 cited earlier 
as asking: what if marijuana is actually good for public health?) As pointed out in Chapter 15, 
in the United States, a majority of the population has recently shifted to favoring the decrimi-
nalization of marijuana.

THE GENETIC “IMPROVEMENT” OF MARIJUANA DUE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
Ironically, law enforcement pressure has had the unintended effects of (1) driving marijuana pro-
duction indoors, where it is harder to locate, and (2) increasing potency. Cannabis quality and yield 
efficiency have been greatly improved by breeders and cultivators, especially in the Netherlands 
and North America, since the early 1970s. Breeding has generated strains that are more potent, 
more productive, faster maturing, hardier, and more attractive to consumers. Yields have also been 
increased dramatically by improved cultivation techniques. The cultivation of elite female clones 
and the use of indoor production techniques that hide plants from the authorities (typically in bed-
rooms, basements, attics, closets, garages, or sheds) have been perfected. Growers are able to har-
vest up to six crops annually, with much greater or faster growth in smaller spaces than achieved 
previously.
Breeding of superior intoxicating strains of C. sativa has largely been done in a clandestine fash-
ion because of the illegality of marijuana. However, by no means have marijuana breeders regarded 
themselves as engaging in a shameful activity, and indeed, many are proud of their achievements, 
often exhibiting photos of their best plants and buds on the Internet (usually under a pseudonym). 
There are also competitions for the most impressive strains, particularly in the Netherlands. Best 
known of these is the annual High Times (magazine) “Cannabis Cup” in Amsterdam (Smith 2012; 
Figure 12.14). The breeding achievements of motivated amateur horticulturists can be remarkable. 
FIGURE 12.12 Lurid, mid-twentieth century, American governmental propaganda posters (in the public 
domain) demonizing marijuana as a catalyst for sexual deviance and psychosis. Ironically, such exaggerated 
warnings undermined the credibility of subsequent health cautions. Also ironically, there is substantial evi-
dence that marijuana can indeed decrease inhibition and increase libido and sexual pleasure (Stuart et al. 2014).

In the eighteenth century, “gooseberry clubs” became popular in Britain, with the goal of giv-
ing prizes for the heaviest gooseberries (the fruit of Ribes species). Previously, wild gooseberries 
weighed only about 7 g and were about the size of a small pea, but the breeding efforts produced 
fruits resembling small apples and weighing as much as 57 g (Small 2013a).
The authorities attempting to suppress marijuana cultivation have been faced with the daunting 
problem of limited international control over distribution of seeds and knowledge. The Netherlands 
has been uniquely responsible for much of this situation, as it has been substantially free to develop 
marijuana strains and knowledge and to disseminate both throughout the world via the Internet. The 
information revolution has spread technical knowledge globally, while Web blogs and chat groups 
provide tips about every aspect concerned with acquiring, growing, preparing, and using marijuana.
FORMAL BOTANICAL NOMENCLATURE AND “STRAINS” OF CANNABIS SATIVA
Terms used in botanical classification are dealt with in Chapter 18, but one technical point bears 
mention here in order to correctly refer to genetic variations of marijuana plants. Article 2.2 of the 
current nomenclatural code for cultivated plants (Brickell et al. 2009), a legalistic document that 
governs names for cultivated plants, forbids the use of the term “strain” as equivalent to “cultivar” 
for the purpose of formal recognition. Very few marijuana strains satisfy the descriptive require-
ments for cultivar recognition, although many marijuana cultivars (mostly grown for fiber or oilseed 
rather than cannabinoids) do and by convention are denoted in single quotes. However, Cannabis 
strains are conceptually identical to Cannabis cultivars. Snoeijer (2002) treated Cannabis strain 
names as equivalent to cultivar names.
THE EVOLUTION OF HIGH-THC STRAINS
High-THC forms of Cannabis were initially selected many centuries (possibly millennia) ago, and 
during these early times, fairly primitive techniques were employed to make intoxicant preparations. 
Particularly in recent decades, a considerable understanding of the biochemistry and genetic control 
of cannabinoid metabolism has been achieved, and strains are now being generated that are rich 
in given cannabinoids for potential medicinal applications. Sophisticated techniques for breeding 
strains have been developed, including the generation of all-female lines (Chapter 4). Technologies 
(described in this chapter) have been created to collect and concentrate the THC-rich heads of the 
glandular trichomes, and this development may have resulted in the selection of strains in which the 
THC-rich trichome heads separate readily so that they can be collected easily.
In previous chapters, information has been provided on some of the ways that the characteristics 
of high-THC strains have evolved. Strains have been chosen that differ in architecture (Chapter 6) 
and cannabinoid profile (as noted in Chapter 11). Geographical biotypes have been found with one 
or more rare cannabinoids in unusually high presence (Chapter 11), which is probably the result of 
genetic drift (change in population genetics occurring in small populations simply by haphazard 
survival of unusual plants). A variety of different essential oil profiles seem to have been selected in 
high-THC strains (Chapter 9). There also seems to have been selection for concentration and distri-
bution of the secretory glands, with very large densities of the glands and larger glands present on 
the floral bracts of some strains (Chapter 11). In response to demand for very high levels of THC, 
there has been selection for congested female inflorescences (production of numerous, well-formed 
“buds” being a recent quality criterion; Chapter 11).
Chapter 6 provided information on the evolution of shoot architecture in the two groups of high-
THC plants (“indica type” and “sativa type”), and Chapter 3 provided information on how the seeds 
of domesticated plants (including the high-THC groups) have been modified by comparison with 
wild plants. This information is not repeated here.
The two basic kinds of high-THC plants (sativa type, characterized by very high THC levels, and 
indica type, characterized by moderate amounts of THC supplemented by noneuphoric CBD) are

described next. They have become foundational breeding material for generating by hybridization 
a wide range of marijuana strains.
“SATIVA TYPE” AND “INDICA TYPE,” THE TWO 
DOMESTICATED KINDS OF MARIJUANA PLANTS
Two discernibly different groups of high-THC cannabis plants were selected in Asia: “sativa type” and 
“indica type.” The ancient distribution of these is shown in Figure 2.7, and in Figure 2.8, it is pointed 
out how the much more popular “sativa type” has been distributed in much of the world. In Figure 
18.13, it is noted that the indica type probably arose from the sativa type and that extensive hybrids 
have been generated between the two kinds. The terms “indica” and “sativa” are widely employed, 
in the senses explained in this section, in innumerable books and websites providing instructions on 
how to (usually illegally) cultivate marijuana and more recently for medical marijuana.
Table 12.1 summarizes differences that have been alleged to distinguish the two kinds (no ade-
quate statistically based study of differences has been published, and since hybrids between the two 
kinds dominate strains of marijuana currently grown, the two kinds are best considered as polar 
extremes connected by a continuous spectrum of intermediate forms). The two kinds are contrasted 
in Figures 12.15 through 12.17.
Strains of the sativa type tend to resemble European fiber cultivars, often being almost as tall 
although usually much more branched and tending to have relatively narrower leaflets. Sativa type 
strains characteristically have very high THC level in the cannabinoids and no or small amounts of

CBD. As pointed out in Chapter 18, usage of the term “sativa” to indicate extremely intoxicating 
(high-THC) plants is quite inconsistent with the tradition of employing the “epithet” (a word used 
in scientific names) taxonomically for nonintoxicant plants. Sativa type strains are extremely wide-
spread in the illicit trade of Western nations.
Indica type strains tend to be short (about a meter in height) and compact under the often inhospi-
table conditions under which they are typically grown in Asia. They are often also highly branched, 
with large leaves and wide leaflets. The appearance is often reminiscent of a miniature, conical 
Christmas tree. Strains of this group characteristically have moderate levels of both THC and CBD 
in their cannabinoid profile. Like the sativa type, the indica type has historically been employed to 
produce hashish in southern Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and neighboring countries. Hashish 
is prepared by pooling collections from many plants, so individual plants may vary in proportions 
of cannabinoids (i.e., not all plants necessarily have moderate levels of both THC and CBD).

Clarke (1998a) and McPartland and Guy (2004a) interpreted indica type strains as having evolved in the 
cold, arid regions of Afghanistan and western Turkmenistan and explained their short height as an 
adaptation to the relatively short growing season. The relatively early-flowering nature of indica 
type strains is also an adaptation to a relatively short growing season.
Sativa type strains are very potent (higher in THC than most indica type strains) and hence more 
popular, although harder to grow indoors where room height is limited, because of their tallness. 
Hybrids between the two groups have proven to be well adapted to indoor cultivation and are pro-
gressively being marketed (Clarke and Watson 2006). Increasingly, strains with alleged percentages 
of each type are being sold.
There are varying descriptions in the literature about the contrasting psychological effects of 
indica type and sativa type strains (see, for example, Hazekamp and Fischedick 2012 and Smith 
2012). These descriptions generally credit the high-THC sativa type with producing a more euphoric 
“high” and the lower-THC indica type with substantial CBD with producing a more subdued but 
attenuated (longer-lasting) experience, consistent not just with the lower THC content but more 
particularly with how CBD in marijuana substantially alters the effects of THC, as explained in 
Chapter 13. Erkelens and Hazekamp (2014) summarized the alleged effects as follows: “The sativa 
high is often characterized as uplifting and energetic. The effects are mostly cerebral (head-high), 
also described as spacey or hallucinogenic. This type gives a feeling of optimism and wellbeing, as 
well as providing a good measure of pain relief for certain symptoms… Sativa strains are generally 
considered a good choice for daytime smoking. In contrast, the indica high is most often described 
as a pleasant body buzz (body-high). Indica strains are primarily enjoyed for relaxation, stress relief, 
and for an overall sense of calm and serenity. They are supposedly effective for overall body pain 
relief, and often used in the treatment of insomnia; they are the late-evening choice of many smok-
ers as an aid for uninterrupted sleep.”
In Asia, strains of both kinds were often used to prepare hashish, but in most Western nations, 
they are predominantly employed to prepare marijuana. Traditional Asian hashish is typically rich 
in both the intoxicant THC and the noneuphoriant CBD, and indica type land races have been par-
ticularly selected for making hashish. By contrast, most high-THC sativa type cultivars have been 
selected just for THC, and indeed, most have limited or no CBD. An explanation for the presence of 
CBD in traditional hashish land races was offered by Clarke and Watson (2006): “Hashish cultivars 
are usually selected for resin quantity rather than potency, so the farmer chooses plants and saves 
seed by observing which one produces the most resin, unaware of whether it contains predomi-
nantly THC or CBD.”
SELECTION FOR COLOR IN MARIJUANA STRAINS
The attraction that humans have for white or at least light shades of seeds was pointed out in Chapter 
8. Another example of human preference for light hues is provided by the flowering parts of mari-
juana strains that have been selected by clandestine breeders in the last several decades. There 
appears to have been selection for strains developing whitish inflorescences (Figure 12.18). The 
immature stigmas of the female flowers are whitish, although becoming reddish or brown with age. 
High concentrations of female flowers in the inflorescence of marijuana strains is extremely desir-
able, since this increases potency, and because higher whiteness is reflective of more female flowers, 
selection for whiteness has been a simple way of selecting for higher potency and yield. The secre-
tory glands responsible for producing THC are present in high density on the perigonal bracts, and 
these often glisten under strong light, also contributing to a whitish appearance of the female inflo-
rescence. So-called “white strains” are very popular, as reflected by such names as White Diesel, 
White Fire, White Gold, White Haze, White Ice, White Label, White Queen, White Rhino, White 
Russian, White Skunk, White Widow, Early Pearl, Silver Haze, and X-Haze.
Humans are also fond of mutations that develop purplish foliage in domesticated plants, due to 
the prominence of anthocyanin pigments (e.g., Crimson King, a very popular variant of Norway

maple; red (purple) cabbage). As is evident in Figure 12.19, when C. sativa is exposed to significant 
frost, it tends to become quite purple (or less green, since chlorophyll tends to degrade, revealing the 
anthocyanins), and sometimes, the same effect is noticed at high altitudes (perhaps related to high, 
damaging insolation), demonstrating a propensity for violet coloration. Often, purple coloration 
develops simply because of cultural conditions (Figure 12.19, right). Dewey (1913) found a purple-
leaved mutation arising in Chinese hemp (a fiber biotype, not a marijuana strain), inbred for nine 
years in Kentucky, Minnesota, and Washington, DC. He named the inbred cultivar Kymington 
(based on Ky-Min-[Wash]-ington).
Purple coloration of the inflorescences of marijuana strains became quite attractive to consum-
ers in the second half of the 1970s (Clarke and Merlin 2013; note Figure 12.20), many expressing 
the belief that such varieties are qualitatively superior. Examples of purplish strain names include 
Purple Bubba Kush, Purple Butter, Purple Cheese, Purple Diesel, Purple Dogg, Purple Erkle, Purple 
Haze, Purple Kush, Purple Maroc, Purple Monkey Balls, Purple Nepal, Purple Passion, Purple 
Pine, Purple Pineberry, Purple Power, Purple Pussy, Purple Snow, Purple Urkle, Purple Wreck, 
Grand Daddy Purple, Blackberry, Blueberry, Grape Ape, and Mendocino Purple. The development 
of purple coloration in foliage and/or stems occurs in some marijuana strains, likely reflecting past

selection for expression of anthocyanin pigmentation, and this sometimes alarms illicit marijuana 
growers suspecting that their plants are diseased or haven’t been cared for properly.
PLANT PRODUCTION
Information on outdoor cultivation of industrial hemp for fiber, oilseed, and essential oil is provided 
respectively in Chapters 7 through 9. Most illicit marijuana is also produced outdoors, although wind 
and rain can have detrimental effects on marijuana quality. For the most part, outdoor cultivation 
requirements for marijuana are similar to the requirements for industrial hempseed. Information 
on authorized indoor cultivation of medicinal marijuana is provided in the next chapter, where it is 
noted that over a hundred books, in addition to countless websites, provide detailed directions for 
the illicit cultivation of marijuana plants and consequent preparation of cannabis products. There is 
nothing fundamentally different in growing C. sativa for legitimate or illegitimate purposes, except 
for the needs for stealth and concealment when cultivating the plant illegally. Of course, this book 
is not intended to provide guidance on illegal cultivation.
DISTORTION OF BOTANICAL AND HORTICULTURAL 
TERMS BY THE MARIJUANA TRADE
Cannabis sativa is a plant and is most precisely described by the scientific terminology conventionally 
employed by biologists, agriculturists, and horticulturalists. For the past half-century, marijuana has 
been produced, traded, and employed mostly by people with limited knowledge, interest, and appre-
ciation of “official” terminology and indeed who have often delighted in adopting terms that were 
unintelligible to conventional society. Unfortunately, some of these terms are ambiguous; i.e., they 
have one meaning scientifically and another meaning in the context of marijuana-specific street 
language. Frequently, technical botanical terms have been misinterpreted by the marijuana-using 
community (facetiously, one may ask why these intellectual lapses occurred). Sometimes, the dif-
ferences in the meanings are subtle and require thought to understand exactly how a scientific term 
has been distorted. The terms in Table 12.2 especially often lead to misunderstanding.
TECHNOLOGIES FOR PREPARING CANNABIS DRUGS
Marijuana is consumed in a wide variety of forms, as discussed in this and the next chapter. These include 
several preparations that are smoked, edible formulations, skin patches, ointments, sprays, capsules, sup-
positories, and even sex lubricants for women. This chapter is concerned with formulations, apparatus,

and methods used mainly for recreational purposes, while the next chapter is concerned with medical 
technologies, many of which are based on the same kinds of apparatus used for recreational marijuana.
marijuana
“Manicured marijuana” is composed of flowering parts of the plant coupled with associated small 
leaves, prepared using intoxicant varieties. It is comparable in texture to smoking tobacco. Marijuana 
is conventionally prepared by (1) breaking up the dried flowering tops and eliminating all but the 
smallest twigs, (2) forcing the resulting material through a coarse screen, and (optionally) (3) crum-
bling. The result is a mixture of plant particles, including the tiny secretory trichome glands that con-
tain most of the resin (some resin is smeared on plant particles during preparation). Up until the last 
two decades, in the Western world, marijuana often included a substantial content of seeds (which do 
not contain THC) and foliage (which contains limited THC, as illustrated in Figure 12.21, bottom). 
As a result, marijuana in the past usually contained no more than 5% THC, often less. Currently, 
marijuana rarely has seeds or larger leaves, and the THC content is at least 5%, sometimes as high as 
25%. ElSohly et al. (2016) surveyed about 39,000 samples of cannabis confiscated by the American 
Drug Enforcement Administration between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2014. The proportion 
of sinsemilla (seedless) samples increased, and (consistent with this) the potency of illicit cannabis 
plant material consistently rose from approximately 4% in 1995 to approximately 12% in 2014 (CBD 
content fell from approximately 0.28% in 2001 to <0.15% in 2014). Marijuana is sometimes referred 
to as “herbal-type” cannabis, in contrast to hashish, termed a “resin-type” form of cannabis.
The perigonal bracts subtending the female flowers are very rich in THC, and the market 
for marijuana has evolved toward the use of the unfertilized female inflorescences (which con-
tain these bracts), i.e., the congested flowering branches, usually referred to as “buds,” much 
less frequently termed “colas,” illustrated in Figure 12.22a, b, and c. “Sinsemilla” is the most

frequent term, collectively referring to high-THC marijuana prepared mostly from the unfertilized

because they are usually a reliable indicator of high-grade marijuana (it is impossible to judge 
the quality of manicured marijuana without smoking it or measuring THC content). Contents 
of 10% to 20% THC are common in street grade bud. Rarely, 30% THC marijuana is found 
in illicitly sold material, although such high-potency material is claimed by some authorized 
medicinal marijuana suppliers (and can be achieved by careful trimming away of leaves). Buds 
are too large to smoke directly, so they are broken up into a tobacco-like consistency, often 
using a herb grinder (shown in Figure 12.22d).
traDitional hashish
Hashish (Figure 12.23c) is a relatively pure preparation of the resinous secretions of intoxicant 
varieties of the plant. As traditionally made in Asia, it is prepared by a variety of methods (see

of resinous herbal material collected from the female inflorescences of C. sativa. It is pre-
dominantly prepared by filtering cannabis material through very fine fabric screens (such as 
silk) or sieves. Sieving requires the plants be dried first, and because applying artificial heat is 
usually too expensive, an arid climate is essential (such as provided in regions of Afghanistan, 
Lebanon, Morocco, and Pakistan). Additional treatments following collection of the powdery 
sieved particles vary depending on region, but usually the material is compressed, sometimes 
gently heated, resulting in a solidified, sticky mass, typically pressed or rolled to form hardened 
resinous cakes. Hashish in illicit markets typically has a THC content of 5% to 25% (levels 
as high as 45% have been reported). Texture or consistency varies from putty-like to brittle or 
dusty. Colors encountered include sandy, reddish, and black (often due to oxidation, reflective 
of aging or manner of handling). Green color is often due to the presence of unwanted plant 
material or collection when the plants were immature. Adulterants, such as oils or bulking 
agents, are sometimes introduced.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
In contrast to filtering or sieving (to produce “sieved hashish”), an alternative method of prepar-
ing hashish in Asia is to rub the female inflorescences by hand so that the sticky resin glands and 
secretions stick to the hands (Figure 12.23b) and are scraped off (to produce “rubbed hashish”). 
Similarly in the past, people dressed in leather brushed against the sticky inflorescences until resin 
accumulated on their garments, subsequently scraping off the resin (Bouquet 1950). The hand-
rubbing technique has been mostly abandoned because it is so labor-intensive, although Clarke 
(1998a) wrote that hand-rubbed charas is sold in Himalchal Pradesh, Kashmir, Chitral, and Nepal. 
Abel (1980) stated that in Nepal, workers ran naked through the cannabis fields, and the sticky resin 
was scraped from their bodies. Reports of this rather gross practice are probably apocryphal, indeed 
likely mythical (Ethan Russo, personal communication), as anyone working in a field of C. sativa 
quickly learns how abrasive the foliage can be to bare flesh. Hamayun and Shinwari (2004) is an 
excellent anthropological study of traditional methods of producing hashish.
The abandoned hand-rubbing technique requires that sticky resin accumulate on the plant’s sur-
faces. Stickiness is due to the secretory glands releasing terpene and cannabinoid secretions over 
the outer surface of the glands. Probably the agitation from wind tends to break some gland heads,

which exude their resin. In very windy, dry, or cold environments, secretions tend to volatilize 
more readily, decreasing stickiness (terpenes volatilize readily, THC does not); by contrast, in hot, 
still environments (whether outdoors or under intense grow-lights), secretions appear to accumulate 
more readily, and the plant surfaces can become very sticky. It is unclear whether high-THC land 
races were selected that were particularly suitable for hashish preparation by the hand-rubbing tech-
nique, by virtue of tending to secrete resin readily rather than retaining it within the gland heads, 
but this seems plausible.
Traditional hashish is typically higher in THC content than traditional marijuana although buds 
can be higher in THC. Hashish is also more compact and retains THC levels longer (outer parts 
of a brick of hashish oxidize, but inner portions are relatively protected from oxygen and light). 
Hashish is more portable, transportable, and easier to conceal (both visually and with respect to 
odor). However, traditional hashish requires much more labor and land to produce than marijuana 
of equivalent psychoactive status. Its production is largely restricted to parts of Asia, and its export 
is mostly limited to Eurasia.
solvEnt Extracts
Hashish in the illicit trade may be made by the use of solvents—often a fire and explosion haz-
ard for preparers. There are several counterculture guides on the preparation of such cannabinoid 
extracts (e.g., Gold 1973; Starks 1990). The products range from liquid form (with substantial sol-
vent remaining) through thick oil (most solvent removed) and viscous or hard consistency, depend-
ing on the extent of distillation (Figure 12.24). A variety of terms, most of them slang, are applied, 
the most common of which include hashish oil (hash oil), butane hash (when prepared with butane 
as a solvent), liquid hashish, honey oil, wax, dabs, shatter (referring to a glass-like consistency that 
often snaps or “shatters”), budder, and nug runs. (Note that the word “oil” in these phrases does 
not necessarily indicate liquid form but seems to have been adopted because of viscous consistency 
and/or stickiness. “Hashish oil” may be liquid, semisolid, or tar-like. “Waxes” have the consistency 
of a sticky wax.) Such products may have a THC content of 20%–50% (levels exceeding 60% are 
rarely reported). Solvent-prepared hashish is usually too strong to consume directly and is normally 
cut (diluted) using tobacco or marijuana. Given the lack of quality oversight in illegal operations, 
these formulations often contain toxic residues and may be particularly dangerous. Nevertheless, 
there is considerable home preparation of hash oil, often using nonbud material, material trimmed 
away from the buds (“trim”), or remains (“shake”) after filtering the more potent fractions. Romano 
and Hazekamp (2013) analyzed the comparative value of employing naphtha, petroleum ether, etha-
nol, and olive oil as solvents in preparing cannabis oil and noted that olive oil was the safest and 
cheapest.

high THC content, and deliberate contamination with dangerous drugs.

Solvents are also used to extract cannabinoids by the medical cannabis industry, and reputable 
products are often available in the form of liquids (especially alcoholic) containing considerable 
dissolved cannabinoids, as discussed in the next chapter.
aDvancED nonsolvEnt tEchnologiEs for prEparing concEntratEs of glanD hEaDs
New technologies, not employing solvents, have been created in Western countries to produce prep-
arations, best termed “resin powder,” which are rich in the THC-containing resin glands (or their 
heads). Such concentrates are commonly termed “pollen,” “crystal,” “bubble hash,” and “kief” and 
are also known by a variety of other names. The Asian tradition of using filters is employed, but the 
millipore screens commonly used have much smaller openings (50–150 μm in diameter), and the 
techniques utilized produce a material that is very much richer in presence of secretory glands, very 
much lower in presence of other herbal material, and (usually) higher in THC, by comparison with 
conventional Asian hashish. Clarke (1998a) is widely considered to be the “gold standard” on the 
topic of preparing potent marijuana by such nonsolvent methods (especially see the chapter “High-
Tech Hashish-Making”). Although remarkably ingenious systems have been devised to separate and 
collect the cannabinoid-rich trichome gland heads of C. sativa, similar systems have been employed 
to collect the gland heads of its relative, hop (Humulus lupulus), employed as a flavorant and medici-
nal (Bishop 1966; Rigby 2000).
Cannabis “resin powder” is produced by sieving high-THC parts of the cannabis plant through 
very fine-pored screens. Crude grades of cannabis resin powder are in fact the basis of most tradi-
tionally produced hashish (hashish, in essence, is cannabis resin powder that has been very strongly 
compressed into massed material). However, in the last two decades, techniques and apparatus have 
become available that produce cannabis resin powder of exceptional potency (sometimes with about 
50% THC). To date, highly potent resin powder has been produced as “connoisseur,” countercul-
ture, illicit, or quasi-legal drug products that are very expensive and available in limited supply. 
Such high-THC material is generated (1) from bud, to produce very high THC “gourmet” material 
and (2) from the “nonbud” (i.e., usually discarded), low-THC parts of marijuana plants, in order to 
salvage a high-grade of cannabis drug. The expense of such high-THC preparations, due to the high 
cost of preparation, is the chief factor limiting their popularity. In the illicit trade, the very large 
wastage factors mean that high-quality marijuana is generally not used for producing cannabis 
resin powder. Rather, resin powder is produced as a salvage operation based on waste material that 
otherwise is simply discarded. Substantial amounts of high-grade marijuana must be sacrificed to 
produce cannabis resin powder. For example, starting with material of 12% THC, 1 kg of material 
would have to be sacrificed to produce just 1 g of resin powder of 30% THC content (i.e., 99.9% 
of the starting material is “wasted”). The attraction is that relatively little material needs to be 
smoked. However, because of the difficulty in smoking the very small amount of material required 
to become “high,” it is occasionally diluted with regular marijuana or tobacco. The product is pow-
dery in nature, hence adaptable to dispersion in marijuana for purposes of increasing the THC con-
tent of the latter. Because it is so expensive, deterioration is a major concern, but resin powder can 
be stored long-term under appropriate (very cold, dry, dark) conditions for later use.
The terms “pollen” and “crystal” are currently widely applied to cannabis resin powder. 
Uncompressed resin powder is often referred to as “kief” (sometimes “kif”). Very-high-quality 
compressed resin powder is often known as “bubble hash” (Figure 12.25), an expression reflecting 
the frequent occurring of bubbling when the preparations are burned for consumption. The tech-
nologies described in the following concentrate the resin glands into a fine powder, reminiscent of 
plant pollen, and hence the term “pollen” was taken up as also designating the concentrated resin 
glands. The term “pollen” is used almost exclusively in the illicit drug counterculture cannabis com-
munity but is inappropriate since it is incomprehensible to most people. Nevertheless, when search-
ing for information on cannabis resin gland preparations, the term “pollen” needs to be considered. 
Searches for “crystal” often produce information for crystal meth (amphetamine).
 

257
Nonmedical Drug Usage
In the illicit drug counterculture, cannabis resin powder (which indeed is a powdery preparation) 
is compressed (e.g., by 5-ton hydraulic presses modified for the purpose), so that the preparation 
does have a superficial similarity to Asian hashish. Illicit drug counterculture publications use the 
term “hashish” to refer not only to traditional Asian styles of hashish but also to compressed can-
nabis resin powder, although the latter is different from traditional hashish. Clarke (1998a) refers to 
resin gland preparations produced by modern technologies as “high-tech hashish.” When searching 
for information on cannabis resin powder, the term “hashish” needs to be employed.
Preparation of resin powder by modern techniques involves a combination of (1) very carefully 
regulated and limited application of force to separate secretory gland heads from the remainder 
of the plant materials and (2) the use of fine sieves (with very small pores). The sieves have holes 
50–150 μm in diameter, the aperture size varied to separate the secretory glands from other plant 
materials. As noted in Clarke (1998a), marijuana varieties differ widely in gland size and so the fil-
ters used to produce resin powder should have pore sizes appropriate to the range of gland sizes. As 
noted in Small and Naraine (2016b), gland heads decrease in size with age, which can also affect the 
appropriate pore size required. Agitation and/or physical pressure is used to separate the glands and 
may be preceded by freezing to facilitate separation of intact glands. In “wet” techniques, disper-
sion in water is also employed, taking advantage of the principles that the cannabinoids are largely 
immiscible in water and differ in density from other parts of the plant. The result (potentially) is 
the production of a grade of material that is much richer in THC level than conventional marijuana. 
Portable handheld devices known as “kief boxes” are often used to transform small amounts of 
marijuana into a relatively crude grade of resin powder for personal use (Figure 12.26d).
The following are principal techniques employed to produce resin powder.
 
A. “Dry” technologies
 
a. Vibration
 
1. “Flat-screening”: The simplest automated apparatus is a motor-driven shaker-sieve, 
preferably with both up-and-down as well as side-to-side motion. The material is 
placed in a container, the horizontal sieve forming the bottom of the container, and 
the container is kept in gentle motion for a limited period of time.
 
2. “Drum-screening”: Alternatively, a cylindrical container constructed of sieve 
material may hold the material, and the cylinder rotated, as in a conventional 
clothes dryer. Several designs are available. Drum-screening is considered to be 
preferable to flat-screening.
 
 
With these kinds of devices, it is critical to limit the degree and period of agitation 
so that primarily the larger secretory gland-heads are separated. These are the first to 
separate. If agitation is too strong or continued for too long a period, the result is that 
additional plant materials pass through the pores of the sieve material, and the THC 
FIGURE 12.25 “Bubble hash,” very potent forms of hashish (THC content has been claimed to sometimes 
exceed 50%) often prepared from resin powder. Photo at left by Andres Rodriguez, photo at right by J. Adams

258
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
level of the resulting resin powder is decreased. Moreover, by freezing the starting 
material just prior to sieving, the stalked glands become much more easily detached, 
facilitating separation of high-grade resin powder (illustrated in Figure 12.26d). The 
most widely advertised, sold, and used apparatus in the dry technology category is 
the Pollinator (Figure 12.26a), a device inspired by a clothes dryer.
 
b. Sonication (ultrasonic vibration)
 
 
Ultrasonic vibrators are an alternative to the use of motor-driven shakers. Commercial 
sonicator models, employing a liquid bath, are widely used to clean by shaking dirt 
off objects. Because the marijuana used as starting material must not contact liquid, 
the liquid either is simply not placed in the bath chamber or is first placed in a water-
tight container. The resin powder collects at the base of the container or bath chamber. 
Commercially available devices specifically employing sonication for the production 
of cannabis resin powder do not seem to be available.

concentrates of secretory glands starting with herbal material (leaves and flowers). (a) The “Pollinator” is a 
dry sifting machine. Herbal material is placed in the revolving drum, which is perforated with 150 μm holes. 
Resin glands are expelled through the holes and collect in the box containing the drum. (b) The “Bubbleator” 
is constructed like a small washing machine. Frozen herbal material is placed, along with ice water, in a series 
of bags that are perforated with holes of decreasing size that permit the resin glands to be expelled. These 
in turn are placed in the device, which agitates the bags for a period, and then the separated resin glands are 
purified by additional sieving, and dried. This device takes advantage of the insolubility of the resin in water 
and the brittleness of the glands when frozen. (c) The “Ice-O-Lator” is a similar but simpler apparatus, in 
which an agitating device is placed on top of a bucket. Detailed operating instructions are available at various 
websites. These devices may be considered to be illegal drug paraphernalia in some countries. Photographs

B. “Wet” technologies
 
 
Wet technologies exploit the fact that mature secretory glands are heavier than water (as 
well as the fact that the resin in the gland is basically not dissolvable in water), while most 
plant parts are lighter than water. When mixed with water, cannabis powder resin can thus 
be substantially separated. The principal marketed devices also utilize freezing to make 
the secretory glands more separable, combining this with filters and agitation.
 
 
The Bubbleator (Figure 12.26b) resembles a miniature washing machine. Bags made 
up of very fine-pored material (“bubble bags”) are employed (a coarse-pored one with the 
material is placed inside a second bag with finer pores), and by varying the pore size of the 
bags and repeating the sifting process, it is possible to separate a series of resin powders of 
different THC levels.
 
 
The Ice-o-lator (Figure 12.26c) is one of the principal devices used. Material is placed 
in a bucket of cold (4°C) water to harden the resin glands and make them more easily sepa-
rated. Agitation by a motor-driven mixer results in the resin glands separating. The denser 
resin glands sink while the less dense remaining parts of the plant float on the surface. A 
course screen (e.g., with hole size 187 μm) is used to skim off the floating materials, and a 
fine screen (e.g., with hole size 62 μm) is used to separate the resin glands from any finer 
particulate material that has sunk. Resin powder prepared with this apparatus is sometimes 
termed “iceolator hash” or “water hash.”
WatEr Extracts (“tEas”)
The word “tea” in common usage corresponds to two kinds of liquid extract in technical pharma-
cological literature. An “infusion” is a liquid solution extracting a compound of interest, prepared 
by soaking or steeping, usually in water. An infusion is usually made by pouring boiling water over 
herbaceous material and allowing this to steep (it can also be made by adding concentrated extracts 
to water). A “decoction” is an extract obtained by boiling in water (the strained liquor is called the 
decoction). In pharmacy, a decoction may be contrasted with an infusion, where there is merely 
steeping. Decoctions are often made using hard components such as roots and bark that are resistant 
to boiling. Both infusions and decoction are employed to prepare cannabis teas.
When cannabis is smoked, vaporized, or baked, the heat is sufficient to convert essentially 100% 
of the nonpsychoactive THC acid (THCA) to the psychoactive THC. When cannabis is placed in 
boiling water, only a small percentage of the THCA is converted to THC, so that cannabis tea is a 
comparatively less psychoactive way of consumption (unless one likes to drink a lot). Moreover, the 
amount of THC that can be dissolved in water is very low: Hazekamp et al. (2007) found that when 
pure THC is placed in boiling water, only 17% was solubilized. However, it is well known that THC 
is soluble in fats like milk, so adding some form of milk to the water greatly increases the THC dis-
solved. As noted later, in India, beverages prepared with cannabis often have milk added to extract 
the THC. Hazekamp et al. (2007) observed that if milk is added to cannabis tea, it stores well for sev-
eral days, but if not added, most of the THC precipitates in only one day, so that the tea loses its potency.
In Jamaica, cannabis tea is used as a remedy for cold, fever, and stress (Hazekamp et al. 2007). In 
Europe (and occasionally in North America), packages of foliage of C. sativa are available (usually 
illegally) for preparing cannabis tea. The Office of Medicinal Cannabis of the Netherlands (http://www 
.cannabisbureau.nl/en/) provides the following instructions for preparing cannabis tea using marijuana:
• Boil 500 mL of water in a pan with the lid on.
• Add 0.5 g (about two teaspoons or one measuring scoop) of medicinal cannabis.
• Turn down the heat and let the tea simmer gently for 15 minutes with the lid still on the 
pan.
• Take the tea off the stove and pour it through a sieve.
• Keep the tea in a thermos flask if you plan to drink it the same day.
 

260
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
If you want to make tea for several days, use 1 g (about four teaspoons or two measuring scoops) 
of medicinal cannabis for 1 L of water. Then, after preparing the tea as described previously, add a 
package or teaspoon of coffee creamer powder to the warm tea. This will keep the active substances 
in the tea from sticking to the inside of the teapot or cup, reducing its effectiveness. Let the tea cool 
down and store it in the fridge. It will store for several days. You may reheat the refrigerated tea and 
can add sugar, syrup, or honey to improve its taste.
TECHNOLOGIES FOR SMOKING AND VAPING CANNABIS DRUGS
Representative traditional and novel methods of inhaling cannabis are discussed in the follow-
ing presentation (in some jurisdictions, the materials illustrated are illicit). Regardless of smoking 
method, the very undesirable health effects of smoking are discussed in the next chapter, with 
emphasis on the relative desirability of inhalation modes that reduce the intake of toxins.
joints anD Blunts
“Joints” (marijuana cigarettes; Figure 12.27a), also referred to as “reefers,” “spliffs,” “doobies,” and by 
numerous other slang names, as indicated in Abel (1982), are the most widely employed method of 
smoking. Occasionally, “blunts” (marijuana cigars; Figure 12.27b) are prepared, although these are much 
too large for a single dosage. In Europe, cigarettes are frequently fashioned by combining tobacco with 
0.1–0.3 g of marijuana, often using high-potency material since the tobacco occupies much of the ciga-
rette; in North America, tobacco is infrequently employed and joints tend to be smaller. In the past in 
North America, marijuana was of lower potency, and up to 0.5 g was placed in a joint. The word “spliff” 
is sometimes used for a joint prepared with both cannabis and tobacco, but in the West Indies, where the 
term originated, and in North America, it normally designates a joint made only with marijuana.

Roach clips are devices employed to hold the lit butt of a joint, in order to avoid finger burns and 
stains. They may be as simple as a paper clip or tweezers. Roach clips are considered passé today in 
North America; an alternative technique is to use a piece of rolled-up business card (Figure 12.27c

An impressive array of smoking devices are employed for marijuana. Very crude instruments suf-
fice, for example, the “chillum” (Figure 12.28a), a simple, clay pipe employed in India and Jamaica. 
(While elementary in design, traditional usage requires an assistant to light the marijuana, while 
the other inhales the smoke through a wet cloth wrapped around the mouthpiece to cool the smoke 
and prevent inhalation of embers.) Often, makeshift crude instruments are fashioned out of all kinds 
of objects, such as hollowed-out apples (Figure 12.28b) and beer cans. Sebsi pipes (Figure 12.29),

metal or ceramic bowl, both features that cool the smoke.
Multicolored handblown glass pipes have become quite popular (Figure 12.30) and are often 
works of art, sometimes designed to change color as the pipes heat up.
WatEr pipEs
Based mostly on tobacco, different cultures have created complex devices to cool smoke by passing it 
through a water chamber (Figure 12.31a). These are known as water pipes, hookahs, hubble bubbles, 
nargils, and by other names. Such instruments modified specifically for cannabis consumption are 
known as “bongs.” Most bongs have a carb (explained in Figure 12.30e) to clear smoke from the por-
tion of the chamber above the water, but some bongs have a removable stem called a “slide,” that has 
the same purpose. Today, a variety of instruments, often quite artistically designed and occasionally 
costing as much as thousands of dollars, are marketed. Often, instruments are constructed from house-
hold materials by individuals for personal use (Stone 2010). A “Rasta chalice” (tracing to Rastafarian 
religious use of marijuana) can be as simple as a hollowed out coconut with two holes, a smoking bowl 
inserted in one of the holes, its tube extending into the water placed in the coconut, and a drawtube 
inserted in the other hole. “Ice catchers” (ice bongs; Figure 12.32) incorporate indents in the instru-
ment so that ice can be supported in the air flow column to cool the smoke (in addition to the water 
through which the smoke is bubbled). In past centuries, extraordinarily crafted hookahs were often

prized possessions of Asian potentates (Figure 12.31b and c). As detailed in the next chapter, while 
water filtration reduces the amount of some harmful constituents, nevertheless, significant toxic com-
pounds are inhaled when water pipes are employed to smoke cannabis. Some hookahs are designed to 
not only pass smoke through water but also through charcoal. However, waterpipes, even when fitted 
with solid filters, are ineffective at improving the THC/tar ratio in smoke (Gieringer 2001).

or burning does not occur. Commercial vaporizers specifically for inhaling the cannabinoids are 
available, particularly the popular “Volcano” series (Figure 12.33b). Personally constructed vapor-
izers have been made (Figure 12.33a). “Electronic cigarettes” (e-pen vaporizers, as shown in Figure 
12.33c) are instruments usually designed to vaporize nicotine for inhalation but are also commonly 
employed for cannabis. Forms of cannabis used for vaporization are usually quite concentrated—
resin or oil. E-pen vaporizers are increasing rapidly in popularity and could well become the most 
common instruments used for cannabis consumption. As detailed in the next chapter, vaporizers 
considerably reduce but do not entirely eliminate the intake of toxins experienced by smoking. 
Jensen et al. (2015) noted that E-cigarette liquids are typically solutions of propylene glycol, which 
can degrade to produce alarming levels of formaldehyde during vaping.
DaBBing
“Dabbing” refers to a practice, largely conducted by a subculture of marijuana users, usually 
young, who employ cannabis concentrates (so concentrated that a “dab” suffices) to become 
very high very quickly. The technique was developed partly to efficiently use concentrates, 
which are easily ignited and wasted, and partly to get high rapidly. “Blasting dabs” is done 
by heating on a hot surface (Figure 12.34, right), often as simple as a real nail, or a similar 
structure termed a “nail” (often made of titanium, sometimes quartz or glass), and inhaling the 
vapor. Frequently, specialized instruments are available (Figure 12.34, left), as well as spe-
cial gear such as “dab tools” (utensils for smoking concentrates) are employed. Blow torches 
(often specially designed) are typically used to heat nails or glass bongs (electronic nails have 
been developed to eliminate the need for fire). Some dabbing pipes look like traditional meth 
or crack cocaine pipes, and dabbing using torches has led to the practice being termed “the 
crack of pot.” Like those who drink to become very drunk quickly, the intense highs desired by 
“dabbers” may be a sign of addiction or maladjustment (Loflin and Earleywine 2014). Because 
concentrates produced illicitly are often unsafe, and it is very easy to overdose, dabbing is dan-
gerous (Gieringer 2015), especially for novices.

EDIBLE CANNABIS
Marijuana can be ingested as food, often termed “edibles” (Wolkowicz 2012), such as illustrated in 
Figure 12.35. Eating cannabis to alter consciousness has a long history. India traditionally produced 
“bhang”—chopped, macerated cannabis leaves most often consumed as a beverage (typically with 
added milk), sometimes with other psychoactive ingredients added. To this day, preparing bhang 
is still practiced in India, where “bhang shops” can be found (Figure 12.36). “Majoon” is another 
traditional Indian marijuana foliage-based confection prepared with various foods and spices, some 
of which may also be psychotropic.
Humans are not well equipped to chew and digest herbal marijuana, which is not tasty. Consuming 
hashish is preferable in that less needs to be consumed, but depending on how it was prepared, there 
may be problems of toxicity and dosage. It is preferable to extract the cannabinoids as a solution 
and employ the solution as one would use culinary spices. There are numerous books and Internet 
sources detailing how to prepare foods “enriched” with cannabinoids. Cannabis is frequently con-
sumed in baked goods in Western culture, classically brownies, but also cakes, cookies, and fudge. 
The slower onset and longer duration of the effects of eating rather than inhaling cannabinoids are 
discussed in the next chapter. THC content of commercial edible products has proven to be erratic 
in some jurisdictions, and edibles not properly stored are a hazard for young children.
As noted previously, THC is mostly insoluble in water, although marijuana is nevertheless some-
times made into a “tea” or other type of beverage such as sodas. THC dissolves readily in alcohol, so an 
alcoholic infusion of marijuana can be a route to getting THC into food. Tinctures are typically made 
by placing marijuana in glass jars with alcoholic beverages such as vodka for six to eight weeks to allow 
the cannabinoids to dissolve. A much faster mode of preparation is described in the next paragraph.
THC is fat-soluble, and by infusing it into a fat like butter, milk, or olive oil, cannabis can be 
incorporated into a wide range of edible products. Finely ground marijuana can be cooked with oil 
or butter (Figure 12.37), dissolving the cannabinoids in these fats. Cannabis butter (“cannabutter,”

“butteruana”) can be quite green when prepared by combining macerated marijuana with butter 
because of the presence of extracted chlorophyll. “Recommendations range from 1/8 to 1/2 ounce 
[3.5–14 g] of marijuana per 1/4 cup [59 ml] of oil or butter. Cooking times range from 20 to 
45 minutes. Shorter cooking times should release fewer flavonoids and minimize the grassy taste” 
(Earleywine 2010). The cannabinoid-infused butter or oil can be employed in many recipes, includ-
ing ice cream (Figure 12.38).
As discussed in detail in Chapter 8, hempseed and hempseed oil are widely incorporated in 
edible products. Often outlets marketing cannabis products sell hempseed foods lacking THC as 
well as foods laced with THC, and sometimes, the THC-free products are there simply to augment 
sales because many people purchasing psychotropic foods are sympathetic to anything manufac-
tured with cannabis.
PREFERRED MODES OF MARIJUANA CONSUMPTION
Based on a sample of over 4000 Americans at least 18 years of age who reported consumption of mari-
juana in 2014, Schauer et al. (2016) reported that: “Overall, 7.2% of respondents reported current mari-
juana use; 34.5% reported never use. Among current users, 10.5% reported medicinal- only use, 53.4% 
reported recreational-only use, and 36.1% reported both. Use of bowl or pipe (49.5%) and joint (49.2%) 
predominated among current marijuana users, with lesser use of bong, water pipe, or hookah (21.7%); 
blunts (20.3%); edibles/drinks (16.1%); and vaporizers (7.6%); 92.1% of the sample reported combusted-
only marijuana use.” Smoking, as pointed out in the next chapter, is deleterious to health, and likely, the 
noncombustion consumption of cannabis as edibles and by convenient e-pens will increase in the future.

FAKE MARIJUANA
In recent years, “designer drug” mixtures of shredded plant material laced with chemical additives have 
been marketed as “legal marijuana” alternatives, under such names as Spice, K2, fake weed, Yucatan 
Fire, Skunk, and Moon Rocks (Dresen et al. 2010; Vardakou et al. 2010; Ashton 2012; Rosenbaum et 
al. 2012; Seelly et al. 2012; Thomas et al. 2014a; Figure 12.39). Well over 100 products are being mar-
keted (Zawilska and Wojcieszak 2014), sometimes with, often not with chemicals related to the can-
nabinoids. Frequently with labels such as “not for human consumption” or “for aromatherapy only,” 
the intent has been to provide a marijuana substitute that evaded current laws. These preparations have 
proven to be quite attractive to youth. Most jurisdictions have made these marijuana mimics illegal, as 
they have often resulted in sickness. Synthetic cannabinoids are sometimes used in such products (see 
the discussion of prescription “cannabimimetic” substances in the next chapter). Synthetic cannabi-
noids in samples of Spice products have sometimes shown an affinity for the CB1 receptor (discussed 
in the next chapter) that is four to five times greater than natural THC (Vandrey et al. 2012). A wide 
variety of cheap toxic compounds has also been employed in fake marijuana.
It needs to be pointed out that by no means are all synthetic cannabinoids deleterious. Some are 
useful as research and therapeutic tools (Chiurchiù et al. 2015).
ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES OF DECRIMINALIZATION 
AND LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
There are endless publications arguing the merits for and against decriminalization or legalization 
of recreational marijuana from an ethical perspective. This book is not intended to take a position 
on the issue, but some of the arguments and considerations that are commonly raised are presented 
in the next paragraphs.
The following statement regarding the U.S. marijuana prohibition is representative of the view-
point that recreational marijuana should be legalized: “Our marijuana laws are clearly doing 
more harm than good… Law enforcement agencies today spend many billions of taxpayer dol-
lars annually trying to enforce this unenforceable prohibition. The roughly 750,000 arrests they 
make each year for possession of small amounts of marijuana represent more than 40% of all drug 
arrests. Regulating and taxing marijuana would simultaneously save taxpayers billions of dollars in

cipal marketed “fake marijuana” products. Photo (public domain) by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

enforcement and incarceration costs, while providing many billions of dollars in revenue annually. 
It also would reduce the crime, violence and corruption associated with drug markets, and the vio-
lations of civil liberties and human rights that occur when large numbers of otherwise law-abiding 
citizens are subject to arrest. Police could focus on serious crime instead. The racial inequities 
that are part and parcel of marijuana enforcement policies cannot be ignored. African-Americans 
are no more likely than other Americans to use marijuana but they are three, five or even 10 times 
more likely—depending on the city—to be arrested for possessing marijuana… Who most benefits 
from keeping marijuana illegal? The greatest beneficiaries are the major criminal organizations in 
Mexico and elsewhere that earn billions of dollars annually from this illicit trade—and who would 
rapidly lose their competitive advantage if marijuana were a legal commodity…. Like many parents 
and grandparents, I am worried about young people getting into trouble with marijuana and other 
drugs. The best solution, however, is honest and effective drug education” (Soros 2010).
The following statement is representative of the viewpoint that marijuana should not be 
legalized: “Marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal drug in the U.S. and around the 
world. Those who support its legalization, for medical or for general use, fail to recognize that 
the greatest costs of marijuana are not related to its prohibition; they are the costs resulting 
from marijuana use itself… Rapidly accumulating new research shows that marijuana use is 
associated with increases in a range of serious mental and physical problems. Lack of public 
understanding on this relationship is undermining prevention efforts and adversely affecting the 
nation’s youth and their families. Drug-impaired driving will also increase if marijuana is legal-
ized… Since legalization of marijuana for medical or general use would increase marijuana use 
rather than reduce it and would lead to increased rates of addiction to marijuana among youth 
and adults, legalizing marijuana is not a smart public health or public safety strategy for any 
state or for our nation” (DuPont 2010).
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• London’s hosting of the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games was associ-
ated with the construction of Britain’s largest piece of public art, officially named “The 
ArcelorMittal Orbit.” Located in Olympic Park in Stratford, London, it is 114.5 m tall 
(the Eiffel Tower is 324 m in height). The construction is eerily reminiscent of a hookah 
(Figure 12.40).
• Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, in the Middle East, a sect known as the 
Assassins—followers of Hasan-ibn-Sabah—dominated the Middle East through a reign of 
terror. Italian traveler Marco Polo (1254?–1324?) reported that the Assassins used a drug 
to rouse themselves to bloody deeds. In the nineteenth century, several European writers 
claimed that the word “Assassin” was derived from the word “hashish” and that this was 
the drug used by the Assassins. Thereafter, Cannabis was frequently associated with vio-
lence in many anti-marijuana stories, although marijuana is well known to induce sleepi-
ness rather than hyperactivity and aggression.
• Intercouple violence in a marriage has been found to be less when one spouse is a mari-
juana smoker and even less when both partners are users (Smith et al. 2014).
• In the 1890s, several women’s temperance societies recommended the recreational use of 
hashish instead of alcohol, in the belief that liquor led to wife-beating, while hashish just 
made people sleepy.
• The recreational use of cannabis in the United States is so widespread that about 10% of 
paper currency has been found to be contaminated with cannabinoid residues (Lavins et 
al. 2004).
• President Bill Clinton is famous for saying “When I was in England I experimented with 
marijuana a time or two, and I didn’t like it. I didn’t inhale.” Clinton is believed to have 
had hemp beer (“Hempen Gold beer” manufactured by the Frederick Brewing Company

of Frederick, Maryland) served on February 15, 1999, on Air Force One, the presidential 
jet. Beer, of course, is usually flavored principally by hemp’s cousin, hop. According to one 
reporter, the president “tasted but didn’t swallow.” President Barack Obama replied when 
asked if he had smoked marijuana, “I inhaled frequently…that was the point” (https://
www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpBzQI_7ez8).
• “420” (4:20, 4/20, pronounced four-twenty) is a code reference to marijuana consumption, 
a term dating to the early 1970s in California. It has been suggested that the expression 
traces to 4:20 p.m., a time when school is over and students are free. Celebrations to advo-
cate the legalization of marijuana (Figure 12.41) and other events based on marijuana are 
commonly scheduled for 4:20 during the day and on April 20 (i.e., fourth month, 20th day). 
The Colorado Department of Transportation replaced the frequently stolen Mile Marker 
420 sign on I-70 east of Denver with one reading 419.99 to stop the thievery. The occasional 
expression “8:40” (twice 4:20) means that by 8:40 p.m., one has become twice as high as 
normally achieved at 4:20 p.m.
• The number “13” associated with the 13th letter of the alphabet, M, is occasionally used as 
code for “marijuana.” For example, 13 on a motorcycle gang member’s biker jacket some-
times stands for marijuana.
• In the eighteenth century, the term “sawbuck” was slang for a sawhorse, made by join-
ing pieces of wood into an “X” shape to support boards at their ends while they were 
being cut. The first U.S. $10 bill bore the Roman numeral X, and consequently “sawbuck”

became slang for the $10 bill, while “buck” became a reference to the dollar. In the mid-
1900s, “sawbuck” became street slang, apparently originating in Chicago, for a 10-dollar 
bag of marijuana. Since the 1980s, the term has referred to a 10-dollar package of any 
street drug.
• Oxford Dictionaries declared “vape” to be its 2014 word of the year, including the verb 
(“inhale and exhale the vapor produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device”) and 
noun (“an electronic cigarette or similar device; an act of inhaling and exhaling the vapor 
produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device”). Lake Superior State University (in 
northern Michigan), on the last day of 2014, issued its 41st annual “List of Words Banished 
from the Queen’s English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness,” and “vape” was 
one of the 13 words included. Although “vape pens” are predominantly used for tobacco, 
they are increasingly being adapted for marijuana.
• “Budtender” (based on a combination of bud and bartender) refers to a worker who sells 
and is knowledgeable about the cannabis products in a medical marijuana dispensary or 
recreational marijuana shop. The qualifications of such personnel are suspect, and they 
have been referred to as “quasimedical vendors” (Kleiman 2015).
• In assessing the effects of smoking recreational marijuana, many researchers employ the 
unit “joint-year,” where one joint-year equals smoking one joint/day for one year.
• “Bogarting” is a slang verb meaning to selfishly keep something completely for oneself, 
especially applied to joints (a Bogart is a person who hogs a joint). The term is based on 
actor Humphrey Bogart, who habitually kept a cigarette in his mouth.
• In the context of cannabis, a “hotbox” is a sealed room or vehicle in which the exhaled 
smoke from several pot smokers accumulates, so that the secondhand smoke reinforces 
the effects of the original smoke. The method was originally employed to avoid detection, 
but became a social activity. A “Jamaican hotbox” uses a bathroom in which the shower 
is turned on hot, so that steam also fills the room. It has been shown that the secondhand 
smoke in a hotbox can have appreciable intoxicating effect (Herrmann et al. 2015).
• Detecting illicit drugs (including cannabis) in urine has become a multibillion dollar 
industry, and in parallel, “fake urine” (“synthetic urine”) businesses have developed to 
assist users of illegal drugs to pass these tests. (Of course, the simplest way most people 
avoid detection is to obtain clean urine from someone who is not using illicit substances 
and is a match for sex and age.) Typically costing $30.00 to $100.00, some of the prod-
ucts offered are claimed to be heatable to body temperature and sometimes are accom-
panied by portable warmers (since many labs check this to ensure genuineness). The 
“Whizzinator” is a prosthetic urine-delivery device that has been employed to simulate 
actually urinating into a collection bottle for “observed tests.” The best formulations can 
be difficult to detect, closely simulating pH, creatinine, and the specific gravity of normal 
urine. Indeed, there is a sort of chemical warfare between the makers of fake urine, who 
keep improving their product, and detection laboratories, who are constantly seeking new 
ways to detect artificial urine. In some jurisdictions, such cheating is subject to specific 
criminal penalties.

13 Medical Marijuana: 
Theory and Practice
INTRODUCTION TO THE CONTROVERSY
“Medical marijuana” is also known as “medicinal marijuana,” although some clinicians consider 
the word marijuana to be pejorative and prefer “medical cannabis.” Medical marijuana is the most 
controversial therapeutic agent of modern times. The idea of employing it as a legitimate medicine 
is shocking to many (Figure 13.1). Marijuana is the world’s most popular illegal drug, and no other 
plant is as extensively associated with crime and immorality. Its principal euphoriant ingredient, 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is the most prevalent illicit chemical and indeed the fourth most com-
mon recreational drug after caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. No other medicine is consumed by 
smoking, a practice that is increasingly viewed as antisocial and the antithesis of health promotion. 
It is curious indeed that, despite its sinful and deleterious reputation, a torrential demand for mari-
juana as a therapeutic agent has developed.
However, the present notoriety of marijuana obscures the fact that forms of cannabis have been 
employed as accepted, reputable drugs since ancient times. The illegality of cannabis during most of 
the twentieth century retarded research and development of modern products, both of a therapeutic 
nature and otherwise. In the last several decades, however, there have been great advances in the 
scientific understanding of how cannabis affects human physiology, and new products and tech-
nologies intended for therapeutic use have appeared. Even countries that unambiguously state that 
there is no legitimate use of cannabis whatsoever have nevertheless authorized the use of certain 
cannabis-based medicines. Long considered a “pariah drug,” it is ironic that access to marijuana 
on the black market “allowed many thousands of patients to rediscover the apparent power of the 
drug to alleviate symptoms of some of the most cruel and refractory diseases known to human-
kind” (Robson 2005). Throughout the Western World, jurisdictions are authorizing access to vari-
ous forms of cannabis, despite the majority scientific viewpoint that evidence supporting usage as a 
therapeutic agent is inadequate for most applications and the prevalent fear that that the increasing 
popularity of medical marijuana is a dangerous experiment with possibly harmful consequences 
for at least a susceptible proportion of individuals as well as for society in general. This chapter 
outlines what is and isn’t known about medical marijuana, which is surely prerequisite to judge its 
utility and potential.
HOW MEDICAL DOES MARIJUANA HAVE TO BE 
TO QUALIFY AS “MEDICAL MARIJUANA?”
Perhaps the chief reason that medical marijuana is controversial rests in its dual capacities to be 
used or abused, both recreationally and medically. This is a frequent problem for psychotropic 
substances that produce temporarily desirable mental states—either euphoria or at least a dull-
ing of pain. Consider the following curious distinction. Pharmacologically, an “elixir” is a sweet-
ened, aromatic solution of alcohol and water containing medicinal substances. A “liqueur” is a 
sweetened aromatic solution of alcohol and water containing flavorants such as spices and herbs, 
which invariably have medicinal properties, so liqueurs effectively are elixirs. In fact, liqueurs such 
as Bénédictine have been employed both medicinally and recreationally. The point is that plant-
based preparations almost invariably have the potential to be used either therapeutically or for other 

276
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
purposes (legitimate or not), so their characterization as medical or nonmedical is problematical, at 
least to a degree.
In Chapter 18, concerning classification of Cannabis, the difficulties posed by “stereotypical 
thinking” are discussed. As pointed out in Chapter 18, stereotypical thinking is a rigid conceptual-
ization of things as being of one nature and not another. Such inflexible thinking makes it difficult 
to view marijuana as having a dual nature, one of which is therapeutic. For many, conditioned by a 
century of vilification of marijuana as a dangerous narcotic, it is difficult to consider it only in the 
context of medicine.
In theory, “medical marijuana” can include all of the forms of recreational marijuana presented in 
the preceding chapter. Similarly, all of the “drug paraphernalia” (illicit or not) described in the last 
chapter could be considered to be “medical devices” (admittedly a stretch in some cases). In practice, 
legislative requirements, safety concerns, and common sense dictate what preparations qualify as 
medical marijuana and what devices are legitimate for medical cannabis consumption. The qualifica-
tions of health professionals to prescribe, recommend, administer, or oversee medical marijuana are 
based on jurisdictional and professional association regulations, and these considerations ultimately 
determine who merits treatment with medical marijuana. As discussed in the next section, the medical 
legitimacy of a considerable proportion of the medical marijuana trade is debatable.
Some authors use the phrase “medical marijuana” to refer just to herbal material; others include 
extracts as well as natural and synthetic cannabinoids. In this book, both “medical marijuana” and 
“medical cannabis” are employed to include all of the preceding. So-called “highless marijuana,” a 
seemingly oxymoronic phrase (“highless cannabis” would be preferable), is discussed later.
MEDICAL MARIJUANA AS A PRETEXT FOR NONMEDICAL USE
In certain jurisdictions, it is clear that recreational usage has been the principal motivation for 
advancing the cause of medical marijuana. For some, the ultimate goal is political, commercial, 
or philosophical, not therapeutic. Indeed, the same contention, that a valid usage for Cannabis 
sativa was a stalking horse or wedge for a hidden illegitimate agenda, was advanced (with some 
truth) during the reintroduction of industrial hemp in many countries. Unfortunately, the legitimate 
advancement of medical marijuana has, to some extent, been hijacked by those seeking to legalize 
recreational usage. In some U.S. states, “the process of getting a ‘recommendation’ for medical 
FIGURE 13.1 The controversy over medical marijuana—a useful therapy or a dangerous drug of abuse?

277
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
marijuana is an open mockery” (Caulkins et al. 2012). At its worst, physicians with questionable 
ethics are providing prescriptions to “pretend patients” to be filled at “nonprofit” clinics motivated 
basically by financial gain (for additional discussion, see Chapter 15). This subterfuge is amusingly 
reminiscent of how “medicinal alcohol” was sometimes deceptively prescribed (Figure 13.2) during 
the period of American alcohol prohibition. Similarly, grape concentrates called “grape bricks,” 
supposedly intended to prepare healthful fruit juice, were sold with the tongue-in-cheek warning: 
“Do not add to a jug of water and put in a dark place or it will ferment into wine.” The unfortunate 
hypocrisy associated with medical marijuana should not detract from objectively evaluating its 
appreciable therapeutic values.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF MEDICAL USAGE OF CANNABIS
Many herbs were employed in past times for medical purposes, and in retrospect, it is obvious 
that, sometimes, the “potions” and “concoctions” employed were useless, even harmful. Often, 
however, crude herbs were genuinely effective because they contained medicinal ingredients. As 
documented in this chapter, C. sativa certainly contains medicinal compounds. Modern medicine 
tends to dismiss past “primitive” and “folk” medicinal practices, but this disrespectful view often 
obscures insightful knowledge that still has potential value for adopting or finding better thera-
pies. Indeed, the careful interpretation of past medical usage of herbs is an important contribution 
toward improving medicine in the future. In the case of C. sativa, there are numerous reviews 
of the ancient history of cannabis for therapeutic purposes, notably, Merlin (1972), Abel (1980), 
Mechoulam (1986), Aldrich (1997), Gurley et al. (1998), Fankhauser (2002), Russo (2004a, 2007, 
2014), and several articles in Russo and Grotenhermen (2006).
It is very difficult to identify the earliest written reference to therapeutic use of C. sativa, and 
often, in ancient times, medicinal usage merges with ritualistic, spiritual, or religious practices. As 
most modern historians appreciate, early history in general is often poorly documented, very dif-
ficult to interpret, and subject to the imaginations of both the ancients who recorded information 
and modern interpreters. Nevertheless, it is clear that cannabis was employed in major civiliza-
tions of the ancient world, including Assyria, Egypt, India, Greece, Rome, and the Islamic empire. 
Certainly, cannabis has a very long and extensive folklore associated with it, as well as many enthu-
siastic interpreters of that history. The phrase “medical marijuana” has exploded in popularity in 
recent decades, but in fact, cannabis has been used for medical purposes throughout most of the 
world, in the majority of human cultures, for most of recorded history.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Cannabis has been applied medicinally in folk medicine since antiquity in Asia. For several thousand 
years, it was employed to treat a wide variety of illnesses, particularly in traditional herbal medicine 
of China, Ayurvedic medicine of India, and Tibetan medicine. Analgesic use is implied from Chinese 
oral tradition allegedly dating to 2700 BC (Li 1973; Figure 13.3, left), and East Indian documents in the 
Atharva Veda dated at about 2000 BC (Gurley et al. 1998). The Egyptian Ebers Papyrus (Figure 13.3, 
right) described a plant called shemshemet, often interpreted as C. sativa because of allusions to its fiber 
and medicinal uses, although the accuracy of this is uncertain (Abel 1980; Wills 1998).
Assyria was a major Near East kingdom and empire from about 1250 BC to 612 BC. Assyrians 
employed cannabis as a psychoactive mind-altering drug as well as for medical purposes 
(Mechoulam and Parker 2013a). As C. sativa was spread through the Middle East and Africa over 
the last two millennia, medicinal usages were adopted, particularly in the Mohammedan world, 
especially in Persia and Arabia. Indeed, the word “hashish” is Arabian in origin. However, intoxica-
tion is strongly discouraged in Islam, and over the centuries, this resulted in periods of suppressing 
the use of cannabis (Nahas 1982). Zlas et al. (1993) recorded an interesting medical usage based 
on the skeleton of a girl about 14 years of age found in a fourth century gravesite near Jerusalem. 
She had apparently died in childbirth, unable to expel a full-term fetus, the skeleton of which was 
present in her mother’s pelvis. Ashes in the tomb were found to have cannabinoids, suggesting that 
cannabis had been burned to produce vapors to promote uterine contraction and reduce labor pains, 
properties long attributed to the plant.
With the transfer of African slaves to South America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
traditional medical (as well as recreational) usages were imported to the continent, particularly to 
Brazil. The same cultural diffusion seems to have occurred when African slaves were transferred 
to the Caribbean area. In the West Indies, where cannabis is used extensively, it may have been 
introduced by workers from India and elsewhere in Asia during the mid-1800s (Rubin and Comitas 
1975; Wills 1998).

Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
Medicinal usage of cannabis in prehistoric Europe was very limited in ancient times (Zuardi 
2006). Scythian invaders are suspected of bringing some medicinal knowledge of cannabis from 
the Middle East to Europe more than two millennia ago (see the historical account in Chapter 12). 
Cannabis was employed medicinally in ancient Greece and Rome, as recorded in the Herbal of 
Dioscorides (ca. 40–90 AD; Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist whose five-volume 
De Materia Medica was widely respected for 1500 years) and the records of Galen (129–ca. AD 
200 to 216; Greek physician, surgeon and philosopher; prominent authority in the Roman empire 
who influenced Western medicine until the nineteenth century). For the first millennium in Europe, 
there was limited medicinal usage of cannabis, and while, subsequently, C. sativa was employed 
in various remedies, it appears that the species was grown almost exclusively for fiber hemp. Asian 
medicinal usage of high-THC cannabis was mostly ignored in Europe until the nineteenth century.
The French psychiatrist Jacques-Joseph Moreau (1804–1884; Figure 13.4, right), nicknamed 
“Moreau de Tours,” observed the effect of hashish during his North African travels in the 1830s. 
He theorized that it produced psychosis and might be useful in treating mental illness (Zuardi 
2006). Moreau’s activities stimulated the “Club des Hashischins” of Paris (described in the previ-
ous chapter) to flourish in the 1850s, using hashish as a route to “esthetic self-realization” (Kalant 
2001). Cannabis was seriously introduced into Western medicine in the first half of the nineteenth 
century, notably through William B. O’Shaughnessy (1809–1889; Figure 13.4, left). An Irish physi-
cian working for the British Crown in Calcutta in the 1830s, he recommended cannabis for pain, 
sedation, inflammation, vomiting, convulsions, and spasticity, remarkably reminiscent of several of 
the conditions currently being treated with marijuana. As a result of O’Shaughnessy’s enthusiasm, 
extracts of cannabis were adopted into the American pharmacopoeia (official publications listing 
medicinal drugs, their effects, and their uses) and the British equivalent. The U.S. Pharmacopoeia 
listed cannabis from 1850 to 1942, available for such conditions as labor pain, nausea, and rheuma-
tism (indeed, foreshadowing modern usage for alleviation of pain and spasticity). Cannabis prepa-
rations were listed in the British Pharmaceutical Codex of 1949. It was possible to order cannabis 
tinctures from Sears Roebuck catalogues of the 1900s. Cannabis drug preparations were exten-
sively used in the West between the middle of the nineteenth century and World War II, particularly 
as a substitute for opiates and as antispasmodic, analgesic, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), and seda-
tive agents (Mikuriya 1969). Cannabis was used to treat a very wide range of ailments, including 
FIGURE 13.4 Physicians who pioneered in the use of cannabis in Western medicine. Left: William B.

tributions by Queen Victoria. Right: Jacques-Joseph Moreau. Moreau promoted examination of the psychiat-
ric effects of cannabis, but by acquainting France with hashish, he also stimulated its recreational use. Public 
domain illustrations.

insomnia, headaches, anorexia, sexual dysfunction, whooping cough, and asthma. Orally adminis-
tered tinctures, especially alcoholic, were particularly popular, with hundreds of brands in circula-
tion (Fankhauser 2002; antiquecannabisbook.com; Figure 13.5).
Following the Second World War, medical use declined because of several developments: qual-
ity limitations of available cannabis (such as variable potency, poor storage, and erratic absorption 
of fluid products); the introduction of new medications, including vaccines and alternative pain 
relievers; the development of hypodermic syringes allowing the injectable use of morphine; the use 
of synthetic analgesics and sedatives; and the progressive criminalization of cannabis. After the 
Second World War and until the end of the twentieth century, there was very limited authorized 
medical use, and the plant and its medicinal preparations fell into disgrace. Nevertheless, toward 
the end of the twentieth century, there was considerable unauthorized dispensing of marijuana to 
gravely ill people by so-called “compassion clubs” (Feldman and Mandel 1998), in addition to 
widespread self-medication using illegal street marijuana. In 1996, voters approved Proposition 
215, making California the first American state to legalize the medicinal use of cannabis. In 2001, 
Canada became the first country in the world to adopt a federal system regulating the use of herbal 
marijuana for “medicinal purposes” (Fisher and Johnston 2002).
Currently, cannabis is frequently prescribed as a complementary or adjunct medicine, not a pri-
mary or initial treatment for serious conditions. This, however, represents a great change over the 
virtual ban on medicinal usage several decades ago. Thousands of researchers have recently under-
taken medical research on cannabis, and as explained in this chapter, the prospects for greatly 
increased medical usage are very promising.
NONCANNABINOID MEDICINAL COMPONENTS
While this chapter deals mainly with the medicinal significance of the cannabinoids of Cannabis, it 
may be noted that other constituents of the plant have medical importance. As noted in Chapter 8, 
the fixed oil of Cannabis (hempseed oil) is highly nutritional, sometimes serving as therapeutic 
FIGURE 13.5 Nineteenth century medicinal cannabis bottles displayed in the Hash, Marijuana & Hemp 
Museum in Amsterdam. Photo by Didier le Ger (CC BY SA 3.0).
 

281
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
nutritional supplements (particularly for cardioprotection by preventing platelet aggregation) and 
also as topical preparations for the treatment of skin conditions (especially for improving atopic 
dermatitis).
The noncannabinoid components in marijuana may also contribute significantly to potential 
therapeutic effects, and so any consideration of medicinal marijuana and of THC delivery systems 
needs to take this into consideration. As noted in Chapter 9, the essential oil of Cannabis may 
have some therapeutic potential. Potentiating interactions of the cannabinoids and various terpenes, 
as well as the 20 or so flavonoids that are present, have been hypothesized to modify synergisti-
cally the psychological and physiological effects of cannabis drugs (McPartland and Pruitt 1997, 
1999; Clarke 1998c; McPartland 2001; McPartland and Mediavilla 2002; Russo 2011a). McPartland 
and Russo (2001) concluded, “Good evidence shows that secondary compounds in cannabis may 
enhance the beneficial effects of THC. Other cannabinoid and non-cannabinoid compounds in 
herbal cannabis or its extracts may reduce THC-induced anxiety, cholinergic deficits [affecting key 
components of the nervous system], and immunosuppression. Cannabis terpenoids and flavonoids 
may also increase cerebral blood flow, enhance cortical activity, kill respiratory pathogens, and 
provide anti-inflammatory activity.” The phrase “entourage effect,” first proposed by Ben-Shabat 
et al. (1998) and Mechoulam and Ben-Shabat (1999), refers to the collective physiological interac-
tion of chemicals that naturally occur with endocannabinoids and modify their effects, normally in 
a beneficial manner, and it is clear that similarly, there are beneficial therapeutic effects from inter-
actions among components of medical marijuana. However, Fischedick et al. (2010) indicated that 
aside from the established interaction of THC and cannabidiol (CBD), it is premature to draw hard 
conclusions about therapeutic drug effects among the cannabinoids and other compounds.
BIAS IN RESEARCH ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA
The medicinal efficacy of cannabis is extremely controversial and regrettably is often confounded 
with the issue of balancing harm and liberty concerning the proscriptions against recreational use 
of marijuana. There is a tidal wave of anecdotal reports and testimonials from people convinced, 
on the one hand, that marijuana has uniquely relieved their medical conditions, or on the other, 
that it led to their physical and mental degeneration. Scientists, physicians, academics, the legal 
and law enforcement professions, politicians, and the general public are all divided on the merits 
and misuses of medicinal marijuana. U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1927–2003) famously 
said, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.” In fact, the facts about medi-
cal marijuana are not yet entirely clear, and bias against it has prevented the search for truth more 
dramatically than almost any other topic of interest to society.
Only studies intended to demonstrate negative effects of marijuana consumption have been per-
mitted until recently, and research funding has been predicated on documenting the harmfulness 
of marijuana. Consistent with this research straitjacket, most scientists working on cannabis until 
recently have provided evidence in publications that it is harmful, often writing with a condemna-
tory enthusiasm that belies neutrality. Such departure from objectivity is often revealed in the man-
datory “introduction” to scientific papers, where authors who have become hostile to cannabis will 
refer to its “abuse” rather than its “use.”
It is important to acknowledge that bias with regard to cannabis may involve excessive support 
as well as excessive opposition. There is a tendency for scientists working on a subject to develop 
respect, even fondness for it, but when they become involved in financial investments, it is all too 
easy to cross an ethical line. As is well known, some academic physicians funded by the pharma-
ceutical industry have engaged in questionable exaggeration on behalf of their patrons, including 
misrepresentation, selective presentation of facts, and “ghost authorship” of publications actually 
prepared by corporate employees. McPartland (2009) analyzed publications concerned with the 
cannabinoid-based antiobesity drug rimonabant (discussed later) and found examples of (1) exag-
geration of its efficacy and safety, (2) lack of criticism, (3) “disease mongering” (exaggerating the 
 

282
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
frequency and seriousness of an illness to expand the market for its treatment), and (4) failure to 
disclose sponsoring financial support.
The saying “money corrupts” is applied to many of the institutions of society, and unfortunately, 
it also applies to science, as noted in the previous paragraph. Very few scientists currently are self-
financed or are supported by employers or granting agencies that are completely free of preferences 
regarding expected discoveries and conclusions. Virtually every scientist is constrained by finances, 
almost always severely, and when a particular subject is contentious, significant pressure by man-
agement or other controllers of resources is common. When an adversarial relationship develops 
between scientists and the sources of their funding, the latter almost always prevail.
Although scientists are rarely completely free to conduct science, fortunately, there is an almost 
universal understanding that scientific truth ultimately is advantageous for almost everyone. Science 
is indeed a search for truth, and scientists employ rigorous experimental designs and objective sta-
tistical tests to evaluate the merits of what they are investigating. So how could bias alter the truth-
fulness of their results? First, “It is a natural tendency of most researchers to overstate the strength 
of their own research in relation to their favorite causal hypotheses; this near-universal phenomenon 
among researchers is referred to generally as ‘wish bias’” (Macleod and Hickman 2010; cf. Wynder 
et al. 1990). Basically, it amounts to making a mountain out of a molehill. Second, scientists are 
human, and indeed often blind to their frailties, and with the best of intentions, observations and 
analyses can be faulty. And third, it is all too easy to inflate the significance of one set of findings 
while downplaying contrary results—so those who were already convinced that marijuana is bad 
may tend to exaggerate its harm while those who were already convinced that marijuana is good 
may do the opposite.
The objectivity of scientific evaluation of the medicinal value of marijuana to date has indeed 
been questioned. Up until about the start of the twenty-first century, it was extremely difficult to 
undertake cannabis medical research. In the words of Hirst et al. (1998): “The…status of cannabis 
has made modern clinical research almost impossible. This is primarily because of the legal, ethi-
cal and bureaucratic difficulties in conducting trials with patients. Additionally, the general attitude 
towards cannabis, in which it is seen only as a drug of abuse and addiction, has not helped.”
The respected journal Nature (2001) stated: “Governments, including the U.S. federal govern-
ment, have until recently refused to sanction the medical use of marijuana, and have also done what 
they can to prevent its clinical testing. They have defended their inaction by claiming that either 
step would signal to the public a softening of the so-called ‘war on drugs’… The pharmacology 
of cannabinoids is a valid field of scientific investigation. Pharmacologists have the tools and the 
methodologies to realize its considerable potential, provided the political climate permits them to 
do so.” The ferocity of opposition to medical marijuana by the U.S. and other governments is indi-
cated by numerous official documents (e.g., U.S. House of Representatives 2005; Drug Enforcement 
Administration 2011). This has led to a climate of fear in which it is difficult to conduct research that 
could contradict the politically sanctioned position. To this day, passionate advocacy for and against 
marijuana is hampering evaluation of medical benefit/risk evaluation.
Experimental design and statistical methods for controlling bias are available (Centre for 
Reviews and Dissemination 2009; Higgins and Green 2011; Higgins et al. 2011) but are infrequently 
employed in cannabis studies (Whiting et al. 2015).
BIAS AGAINST EUPHORIC MEDICINES
The psychopharmacological profession is enthusiastic about, one might even say addicted to, pre-
scription psychotropics (mood, perception, and behavior enhancers and stabilizers). Antidepressants, 
tranquillizers, antipsychotics, stimulants, and other psychiatric drugs often seem to be overpre-
scribed, particularly for the young (Sinclair 2012), the old (Hilmer and Gnjidic 2013), and women 
(Ettorre and Riska 1995). The issue is highly polarized, with camps for and against the position that 
there is overprescription, and indeed such disagreement serves to indicate how hard it is to decide on 
 

283
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
the pros and cons of mind-modifying drugs like marijuana. Regardless, the general goal of medici-
nal psychotropics is to make patients feel good—but not too good.
It is curious that while a chief purpose of medicine is the immediate relief of pain, the opposite of 
pain, pleasure, is rarely identified as a direct medical goal, and indeed, euphoria is frequently high-
lighted as an undesirable side effect of medication. This is particularly true for marijuana. One of 
the objectives of the search for synthetic versions of THC was to find compounds that would deliver 
the medical benefits without the “high.” However, as pointed out by Cristino and Di Marzo (2014), 
“the euphoric effects of cannabinoids are not always an obstacle to their effective administration. 
Mood elevation… may be an important component of its effectiveness in patients with cancer or 
AIDS.”
Notcutt (2004) commented with regard to medical cannabis: “there are many health profession-
als who perceive that a mild psychoactive effect from the drug is somehow wrong. This only seems 
to be of concern to those who do not treat patients in pain or distress… Elevating the mood of a 
patient whose life is miserable because of chronic, untreatable pain would seem to be a worthwhile 
goal. There is also a desire by some to find a form of cannabis that is stripped of psychoactive 
effects, but this goes against the experience with morphine. Any drug that has multiple sites of 
action within the central nervous system is unlikely to be obtained in a form that does not affect 
consciousness, mood or cognition in some way. No one has achieved this with opiates after a cen-
tury of research.”
The Issue of AddIcTIon
Western medicine almost universally frowns on the use of medicinals to produce euphoria for fear 
that patients will become addicted to them. The basis for this is that “it is now well accepted that 
abusable drugs derive their addictive potential from activating the core pleasure/reward circuitry of 
the brain” (Gardner 2014). A common-sense exception is made for those who are terminally ill or at 
least suffering from extremely grave or debilitating conditions. The psychological and physical hor-
rors of those addicted to narcotics are a popular theme in literature, and it is clear that for many indi-
viduals addiction is serious, even deadly. However, some patients complain that caregivers refuse 
to provide adequate amounts of painkillers because of fear that addiction (and possibly lawsuits or 
professional censure) will result. “The reason that patients with chronic pain are not given opiates 
when indicated is…the intolerance in our society to any ongoing use of opiates in non-terminal 
patients. This has been described as ‘opiophobia’ and is a major medical problem” (Trachtenberg 
1994; the similar word “ophiophobia” refers to fear of snakes). It is important to distinguish the use 
of psychotropics in a medical setting from the abuse in a nonmedical context and to weigh the pos-
sibility of addiction in relation to the individual characteristics and context of patients. In the case 
of cannabis, as pointed out in Chapter 12, perhaps 9% of recreational users become addicted, but 
the health consequences pale in seriousness compared to the opiates.
The Issue of IncApAcITATIon (ReducTIon In AbIlITIes) whIle InToxIcATed
Western medicine is reluctant to employ pharmaceuticals that produce euphoria as a side effect 
because in this state patients cannot function as well as healthy individuals. An exception is 
made for those who are suffering chronic, incurable, extremely miserable, or debilitating condi-
tions such as often associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer. 
As pointed out by Fitzcharles et al. (2014): “The overriding principle for any pain treatment is 
to maintain function, without sacrificing cognitive or psychomotor function, a concept clearly 
different from pain management for medical conditions predominantly requiring palliation.” It 
is a remarkable fact that some powerful potentially incapacitating drugs of abuse can be used 
regularly and responsibly. Cocaine is a very serious addictive drug problem in North America, 
but coca leaf is responsibly employed as a stimulant in much of South America in the same way 
 

284
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
as coffee and tea are used (Small 2004). Alcohol is not employed as a medicine (although alco-
holic beverages sometimes have health benefits), but the fact that many can drink responsibly 
also illustrates that some potentially harmful substances can be consumed appropriately by a 
substantial proportion of society. This is not to ignore the dangers of adding marijuana to the list 
of potentially dangerous substances that are permitted, but to point out that compromise rather 
than outright veto is possible.
TRAnsfeR of bIAs AgAInsT Thc To nonInToxIcATIng cAnnAbInoIds
THC is the predominant psychotropic cannabinoid of C. sativa and, were it not present, marijuana 
would not be intoxicating and all the legal problems associated with the plant and its preparations 
would not exist. Most cannabinoids are not intoxicating, so why not free the “innocent” cannabi-
noids from legal constraints? There are some reasons for retaining laws against cannabinoids (as 
is the case in many jurisdictions)—for example, they can be chemically converted to intoxicants 
(the conversion of CBD to THC was examined in Chapter 11), and some synthetic cannabinoids are 
quite dangerous. Nevertheless, for practical purposes, nonintoxicating cannabinoids from the plant 
could be sold as conventional pharmaceuticals or over-the-counter preparations (often classified as 
“herbals” or “supplements”). The stigma that THC bears because it is intoxicating has unfortunately 
been transferred to the essentially harmless cannabinoids. As described later, CBD is the most 
promising medicinal cannabinoid, with astonishing potential for therapeutic applications, and it is 
important for society to relieve this remarkable compound from the burdens of its more hazardous 
sibling, THC.
THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
IN EVALUATING MEDICAL MARIJUANA
Most public knowledge of cannabis, and indeed most literature about it, is based on anecdotal 
evidence—i.e., accumulated random observations and conclusions. Most of what people have 
learned and come to believe is in fact based on repeated observations, and useful “experience” 
is the result of recurrently observing the dependability of phenomena. But the fact that people 
disagree on many “facts” demonstrates that humans are often mistaken. Since there is so much 
disagreement about the merits of medical marijuana, it follows that scientific (statistical) evalu-
ation, including appropriate scientific experimental design, is indispensable to evaluate the pros 
and cons of medical marijuana. Perhaps the chief biasing factor that needs to be controlled is 
expectation, as epitomized by the placebo effect (if you think something is effective, even if it 
isn’t, there is probability it will seem useful). Particularly with respect to evaluation of drugs, 
prior belief about whether they will be effective or not has a powerful biasing effect (Peck and 
Coleman 1991; Kirk et al. 1998; Quitkin 1999). The placebo effect in cannabinoid research 
is as high as 70% (Consroe et al. 1991). To validly evaluate the merits of marijuana, rigorous 
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies (both the investigators and the subjects unaware of who 
is receiving the drug or a placebo) with adequately large samples for statistical evaluation are 
essential (Wright et al. 2012). Without blinding, in some experiments over 75% of participants 
in studies can be aware of whether they have received the drug or the placebo (Grant et al. 2012). 
Appropriately designed studies of cannabis are not yet sufficient to evaluate the usefulness of 
marijuana for many medical conditions, although unqualified claims like “marijuana cures can-
cer” are common.
THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE IN RELATION TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA
The “precautionary principle” is a conservative approach, when a decisive majority view does not 
prevail concerning conflicting evidence on the opposite sides of a publically prominent issue in 
 

285
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
which there is plausible (perhaps uncorrectable) risk to human welfare or to some other critically 
important situation. The precautionary principle came to prominence in 1972 at the United Nations 
Conference on the Environment (in Stockholm), in regard to serious or irreversible harm to ecosys-
tems. In essence, the so-called “principle” advocates inaction or maintenance of the status quo, in 
fear of extensive, catastrophic harm (“it’s better to be safe than sorry”; “err on the side of caution”), 
but is often accompanied with a recommendation that additional evidence should be sought before 
an action is considered further.
The precautionary principle is a reaction to the common view that an activity is innocent until it 
is proven guilty, a regulatory viewpoint that is decidedly dangerous to public health. In the health 
sphere, the practice of medicine is conducted with exceptional caution, and most clinicians are 
very reluctant to adopt new treatments without quite convincing evidence. This is consistent with a 
fundamental precept of bioethics, captured in the phrase “First do no harm” (the Latin Primum non 
nocere or Primum nil nocere; popularly misconceived as part of the Hippocratic Oath).
As documented in this chapter, while there are many potential medical applications of cannabis, 
the medical community is divided on the merit of the majority of possible usages. This disagree-
ment, in the perspective of the precautionary principle, has been employed as an argument against 
the use of medical marijuana. As pointed out in Chapter 15, in regard to the authorization of recre-
ational marijuana, the precautionary principle is one of several relevant considerations. Moreover, 
as also examined in Chapter 15, since the issue of medical marijuana in some jurisdictions has been 
taken out of the hands of the medical profession and put to public vote, the precautionary principle 
is a critical factor for public health.
However, the precautionary principle must not be allowed to block medical progress and the 
availability of effective treatments with cannabis. Medical therapy is frequently and necessarily 
a question of balance of risk and benefit, and a literal interpretation of the precautionary principle 
could prevent treatment merely because there is risk. The practice of medicine is already very 
highly regulated, with appropriate professional evaluation of risk, and medical marijuana should be 
judged on the same basis as are all other developing therapies.
RECENT AUTHORIZED MEDICAL MARIJUANA PRODUCTION AND USAGE
In most countries, cannabis usage for medical purposes has remained prohibited. However, dur-
ing the last several decades, there has been a momentous societal and scientific debate regarding 
the wisdom of employing cannabis drugs medically. This has led to experimental production and 
medical evaluation in many Western countries. Several European and Commonwealth countries 
and many states of the United States currently allow medical dispensation of marijuana, while 
Uruguay and several U.S. states recently have even permitted the sale of marijuana for recreational 
use by licensed vendors. The fact that some governments have authorized medicinal use does not 
necessarily indicate acceptance of its value but often reflects a desire for effort at medical evalua-
tion, compassion for those who haven’t found a better alternative, court decisions that have limited 
legislation, or simply political expediency.
In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a long-standing program of 
research into medicinal marijuana and for a period supplied a handful of patients with medicinal 
marijuana for treatment. In the early part of the twenty-first century, governmental authorities in 
the United States consistently rejected the authorization of marijuana for medical use (Anonymous 
2006). The American Drug Enforcement Administration has been hostile to the medicinal use of 
Cannabis (Drug Enforcement Administration 2013), and for decades research on medicinal prop-
erties of Cannabis in the United States was in an extremely inhospitable climate, except for proj-
ects and researchers concerned with curbing drug abuse. Essentially, the only standard research 
marijuana for experimentation in the United States had to be obtained from the NIH marijuana 
farm at the University of Mississippi, and few were allowed to obtain research material. However, 
in 2014, a very large increase in the number of medical research projects in the United States was 
 

286
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
authorized, reflecting the belated recognition of the desirability of examining the safety and effi-
cacy of medical marijuana.
PHARMACOLOGICAL TERMINOLOGY FOR MARIJUANA
People smoke cannabis because it pleasurably alters consciousness, producing euphoria and relax-
ation and intensifying ordinary sensory experiences. It also alters perception—for example of 
time—and can promote sociability, stimulating laughter and talkativeness. These manifestations 
are common to many social inebriants, but cannabis is fairly unique and is difficult to characterize. 
Moreover, individual response can differ considerably. For example, some people claim that mari-
juana increases creativity, others that it just makes them sleepy (note the discussion presented later 
that different kinds of marijuana may produce different effects).
The word “narcotic,” often used to describe the psychological effects associated with marijuana, 
has been extensively and ambiguously employed in lay, legal, and scientific circles. The term is 
most widely used as an arbitrary juridical category—a narcotic is simply a substance or preparation 
that is associated with severe penalties because of real or alleged dangerous, addictive properties. 
“Legally, cannabis has traditionally been classified with the opiate narcotics, and while they may 
share some euphorogenic and analgesic properties, they are otherwise quite distinct pharmacologi-
cally” (Le Dain 1972). Etymologically, based on “narcosis,” a narcotic would be expected to be a 
substance promoting sleep, and indeed, some use the term to characterize any drug that produces 
sleep, stupor, or insensibility. Both THC and CBD, at least one of which dominates the cannabi-
noids of most biotypes of C. sativa, have sleep-inducing properties at some dosage, albeit CBD is 
stimulative at low and moderate dosages (Piomelli and Russo 2016) and is sedative only at quite 
elevated doses (Carlini and Cunha 1981; Pickens 1981). Moreover, the terpene myrcene is common 
in C. sativa (especially in marijuana strains with appreciable CBD) and is sedative (Russo 2011a). 
Accordingly, the soporific property of cannabis provides some limited justification for referring to 
it as a narcotic, although it is by no means best known for its sedative properties. Nevertheless, the 
term “narcotic” is better known as characterizing an intoxicant than a sedative. Because “narcotic” 
is often used pejoratively, it is probably best avoided as descriptive of pharmacological effects. 
Although substances called narcotics are widely viewed as intrinsically evil, the world’s leading 
controlled so-called narcotic crops have some legitimate, useful applications (Small 2004; Small 
and Catling 2009).
The pharmacological classification of cannabis is controversial. It has been characterized as a 
sedative-hypnotic-general-anesthetic like alcohol and nitrous oxide; a mixed stimulant -depressant; 
a mild hallucinogen, especially at higher doses; a “psychedelic,” like LSD at very high doses; 
and as a separate category of psychic experience (Le Dain 1972). The following terms have been 
used to describe cannabis: psychedelic (mind-manifesting or consciousness-expanding), halluci-
nogenic (hallucination-producing), psychotomimetic (psychosis-imitating), illusinogenic (illusion -
producing), and psychodysleptic (mind-disrupting); as noted in Le Dain (1972, p. 396), all of these 
terms are problematical. None of the terms is completely satisfactory to denote the euphoric psycho-
logical effects of marijuana in general and THC in particular.
There is little dispute that cannabis is a “psychoactive” drug (one altering sensation, mood, con-
sciousness, or other psychological or behavioral functions). However, “psychoactive” is so broad it 
applies to a very wide variety of psychological states. Clearly, marijuana is popular (albeit largely 
illegal), employed primarily as a social inebriant and euphoriant. “Psychotropic,” meaning mind-
altering, is also widely used, but both “intoxicant” and “nonintoxicant” types of Cannabis can influ-
ence the mind by virtue of the properties of THC and CBD. “Hallucinogenic” is less appropriate 
since true hallucinogens are rarely produced. Psychotomimetic (mood-altering) is perhaps the most 
appropriate pharmacological term but is hardly definitive since it could be applied to numerous 
substances, including chocolate and caffeinated beverages. Although not a technical phrase, “mood 
enhancer” is sometimes applied to marijuana.

Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
COMPARATIVE THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF PURE 
CHEMICALS AND HERBAL MIXTURES
An important issue in the therapeutic use of medicinal substances is the relative wisdom of employ-
ing pure chemicals and herbal mixtures. The former have been described as “monomolecular bul-
lets” (implying that they can be directed precisely to targeted symptoms or their underlying causes), 
while the latter have been characterized as “polymolecular shotgun shells” (implying that they 
cannot be directly targeted and may inadvertently cause damage).
“Pharmacognosy” used to be defined as the study of crude drugs. “Crude drugs” refers to materials 
obtained from natural sources, including plants, animals, and minerals. In practice, crude drugs originate 
mostly from plants and are “unrefined” beyond being dried and ground up. Crude drugs from plants 
represent a complex mixture of chemicals that they have produced. Today, the word “pharmacognosy” 
has been expanded to include all drugs from natural sources, including purified extracted molecules. The 
more inclusive word “pharmacology” refers to the study of all drugs. Human therapeutic use of unre-
fined plant materials is the foundation of all medicine, and remains the basis of most healing practiced in 
the world because crude plant drugs are far cheaper and easier to obtain than modern pharmaceuticals, 
and so are widely employed in the Third World. The most extensively utilized herbal medicine is Asian 
ginseng (the root of Panax quinquefolius L.), consumed by hundreds of millions, despite the fact that 
its medicinal value has been almost as contentious as that of marijuana (Small 2006). In the rich, tech-
nologically advanced Western World, most medicines are pure chemicals—single molecules extracted 
from species or synthesized. Marijuana is a crude drug (although purified extracts are not), and as noted 
in the following, this is the basis of much criticism of its value.
In the phrase “crude drug,” the word “crude” simply means “in a natural or raw state, or not 
processed or refined.” However, the word “crude” also means “marked by the primitive, gross, or 
elemental or by uncultivated simplicity or vulgarity.” It is possible that the disfavor for crude drugs 
today is subconsciously being influenced by the latter, pejorative meaning. The fact is, crude plant 
materials in the form of vegetables and fruits are the mainstay of most human health.
In the prestigious report Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base (Joy et al. 1999), 
the following statement is presented: “Defined substances, such as purified cannabinoid compounds, 
are preferable to plant products, which are of variable and uncertain composition. Use of defined 
cannabinoids permits a more precise evaluation of their effects, whether in combination or alone.” 
Modern medicine has been said to prefer single-component “silver bullets” rather than multicompo-
nent “herbal shotguns” (Spelman 2009). Kalant (2001) noted: “The history of drug therapy has been 
to a large extent one of progressive movement away from natural products of unknown or variable 
composition and potency, toward the use of pure active compounds of precisely known composition, 
stability, dosage and pharmacology.”
Pharmacological drug research today is heavily slanted toward discovering or computer-designing 
compounds that affect cellular receptors, compensating for abnormal or inadequate genes at the root 
of diseases. Since medical conditions are often the result of combinations of causes, a single pharma-
ceutical “silver bullet” may not suffice, requiring a combination of silver bullets (or a designer pharma-
ceutical shotgun shell). In either alternative, the movement away from crude natural products remains.
A concern about all crude drugs is that even if they contain therapeutic chemicals, they may also 
have toxic compounds. Dupont (2000) characterized marijuana as “a complex chemical slush” with 
more than 2000 chemicals. While this seems alarming, it should be remembered that our vegeta-
bles, fruits, and cereals are also composed of thousands of chemical compounds, and the liver—the 
largest internal organ—is designed to cope with regular intake of small amounts of toxins.
Western-based medicine has indeed become reliant on single-molecule pharmaceuticals or at 
least carefully evaluated combinations of drugs (described as “polypharmacy”). Even with the 
resurgence of alternative (especially herbal-based) modalities, there is widespread disrespect (in 
the West) for traditional plant-based medicines because they are not precisely defined mixtures 
(although they are effectively polypharmaceutical in nature). However, the perspective that herbal 
 

288
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
(crude drug) preparations are inherently inferior is short-sighted. Many herbal products in Europe 
are standardized and have been clinically demonstrated to be efficacious in double-blind placebo-
controlled trials (Tyler 1993a,b, 1996; Tyler and Foster 1996; Small and Catling 1999).
Defenders of herbal medicine often point out that there may be synergistic effects (which increase 
potency or other desirable effects) or mitigative effects (decreasing toxicity) because of interac-
tions among the constituents of crude drugs and that, over time, humans have learned by trial and 
error the circumstances when these preparations are efficacious (Lewis and Elvin-Lewis 2003). 
Of course, research is required to examine the comparative merits of crude drugs, extracts, and 
synthetic analogues, and this is particularly true for C. sativa. Crude cannabis drugs (marijuana, 
hashish) are currently the main options exercised for medical use of C. sativa, and indeed, they are 
often chosen in preference to extracts and synthetic analogues by patients. It is very well known that 
extracted cannabinoids produce somewhat different effects from crude marijuana (Segelman et al. 
1974; Fairbairn and Pickens 1981; Pickens 1981; Johnson et al. 1984; Wilkinson et al. 2003; Whalley 
et al. 2004; Ryan et al. 2006) and often do not satisfy patients as well as crude drugs, and this sug-
gests that interactions of natural constituents are very important therapeutically (McPartland and 
Pruitt 1999; McPartland and Russo 2001; Russo and McPartland 2003; Russo 2014).
MEDICINAL IMPORTANCE OF COMBINING THC AND CBD
The previous paragraph points out the possibility that there are therapeutic interactions among the 
components of marijuana. In fact, a therapeutic interaction between THC and CBD dramatically vali-
dates such an occurrence. Although widely said to be “nonpsychoactive,” it has long been appreciated 
that, at least at high dosages, CBD has sleep-inducing or sedative properties (Carlini and Cunha 1981), 
although at lower doses, it has alerting properties (Nicholson et al. 2004; Russo and Guy 2006). The 
reputation of “indica type” (high-CBD) marijuana strains for inducing sleep was demonstrated by a 
survey of patients at a dispensary, who chose such strains to treat insomnia (Belendiuk et al. 2015).
It is apparent that CBD antagonizes (potentiates, reduces, mitigates) undesirable side effects of 
THC. CBD ameliorates (in a therapeutic sense) the effects of THC, blocking anxiety provoked by 
THC, reducing psychotic experiences associated with high-THC marijuana, and attenuating memory-
impairment effects of THC (Russo and Guy 2006; Zuardi et al. 2006, 2012; Mechoulam 2012; 
McPartland et al. 2015). The combination of THC and CBD is now appreciated to have medicinal 
advantages, although the nature of the interaction is not well understood (Bhattacharyya et al. 2010; 
Zuardi et al. 2012). Reducing the intensity of the THC experience is considered especially beneficial 
for inexperienced users, who may be subject to panic attacks, paranoia, delusions, or other disturbing 
symptoms on exposure to a high level of THC. Mechoulam and Parker (2013b) commented: “The 
reversal by CBD of some of the undesirable effects produced by pure THC or by cannabis with low 
levels of CBD and high levels of THC…strengthens the view that medicinal cannabis containing rea-
sonably high levels of CBD is a better drug than cannabis with low levels of CBD or pure THC alone.”
Sativex (Figure 13.6) is the most significant innovative cannabis-based medicine developed to date. 
The USAN name for the trade name Sativex is nabiximols. (“United States Adopted Names” [USAN] 
are unique nonproprietary names assigned to pharmaceuticals marketed in the United States.) Sativex 
is standardized in composition and is effectively a tincture. This cannabinoid-based analgesic, devel-
oped by the United Kingdom firm GW Pharmaceuticals (Guy and Stott 2005), exploits the advantages 
of combining approximately equivalent amounts of THC and CBD. Sativex is a buccal (“oromucosal”) 
spray, applied under the tongue or inside the cheeks (never into the nose) using a nebulizer. The extracts 
in Sativex comprise about 70% THC + CBD, minor cannabinoids (5%–6%), terpenoids (6%–7%), ste-
rols (6%), as well as other components (triglycerides, alkanes, squalene, tocopherol, carotenoids, and 
other compounds) derived from cannabis plants (Russo and Guy 2006).
In 2005, Sativex became the world’s first licensed prescription medicine based on extracts of 
C. sativa, when it was licensed for usage in Canada. It is now licensed for various usages in numer-
ous countries. It has been reported that some patients experience stinging or lesions (mouth ulcers) 
 

289
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
from the high alcohol content of Sativex (Scully 2007), and other relatively minor side effects have 
been reported. While it is clear that the interaction of THC and CBD is the principal medically 
beneficial interplay of cannabis constituents, it is quite possible that the additional components in 
Sativex and indeed in marijuana are also beneficial, either additively or interactively.
THE ACCIDENTAL MEDICINAL VALUE OF INDICA TYPE STRAINS
In southern Asia, the homeland of potent intoxicating cannabis preparations, sativa type land races 
used to produce both hashish and marijuana-type products have a cannabinoid profile typically 
dominated by THC, while indica type land races often used to produce hashish typically have a 
cannabinoid profile dominated by both THC and CBD. (This does not necessarily apply to single 
indica type plants, but rather to populations; Clarke 1998a.) For production of hashish, it is desir-
able that considerable resin be produced relative to plant tissues, and so hashish strains often seem 
to have been unconsciously selected for resin production at the expense of lowering THC content. 
The combination of THC and CBD has therapeutic advantages, as explained previously. It is unclear 
whether or not traditional (obsolete) medicines based on C. sativa took advantage of the naturally 
superior medicinal qualities of indica type strains with balanced THC and CBD. In principle, pre-
paring marijuana from such strains should also be advantageous therapeutically, but halving the 
amount of THC (in order to have an equal amount of CBD) has the undesirable effect of increasing 
the amount of material that needs to be consumed (if absorbed by smoking).
OVERVIEW OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA PREPARATIONS
Medical marijuana is currently being dispensed in many jurisdictions. A variety of forms are 
available, as shown in Figure 13.7. Most preparations of cannabis described in Chapter 12 can be 
employed in a medicinal way, but each type has advantages and disadvantages, as discussed in this 
chapter. Illicitly produced cannabis is especially unsuitable for medical usage because of impurities 
and variability of cannabinoid content. Traditional hashish, in particular, is a sticky, contaminated 
mixture, which is very unlikely to be usable for medicinal purposes.
Cannabis is popularly consumed as smoked herbal material, and when experienced users become 
patients using cannabis therapeutically, there is a tendency to remain loyal to their traditional form

of consumption. Hazekamp et al. (2013) reported on a survey of preferences of almost 1000 patients 
employing cannabinoid-based medicines (CBMs), and found that “In general, herbal non-pharmaceuti-
cal CBMs received higher appreciation scores by participants than pharmaceutical products containing 
cannabinoids. However, the number of patients who reported experience with pharmaceutical products 
was low, limiting conclusions on preferences.” Given the very small number of patients who had used 
pharmaceutical CBMs in the study of Hazekamp et al., it is possible that patients habituated to them 
would develop and maintain a preference for them rather than traditional marijuana.
In the illicit drug trade, cannabis preparations based on solvent extracts are unreliable and dan-
gerous. However, alcoholic cannabinoid extracts were widely employed medically a century ago 
(Russo 2003a; Figure 13.8a and b), and solvent-extracts can be produced safely by authorized quali-
fied personnel (Figure 13.8c). Sativex, obtained by supercritical liquid carbon dioxide extraction 
(Potter 2014), is the most successful commercial example. As illustrated in Figure 13.8d, a variety 
of balms, salves, and ointments based on extracted cannabinoids are currently being marketed.
Cannabis resin powder (Figure 13.9), described in Chapter 12, is a relatively well-defined prod-
uct. The devices described in Chapter 12 for manufacturing cannabis resin powder could be used 
to produce a product suitable for medical consumption. Apparatus for the production of medicinal 
marijuana should be sterilizable, and it is not clear that available devices meet this criterion. There 
is no literature reporting the microbiological safety of the products produced by using the available 
resin powder devices and techniques, but appropriate precautions could be taken to ensure adher-
ence to good manufacturing practice and safety in conformity with conventional medical products. 
Cannabis resin powder has the potential to be used like grated Parmesan cheese from a shaker 
bottle, although the natural stickiness of the material can make distributing the material difficult. 
Resin powder could be added to marijuana cigarettes (“reefers”) to increase dosage, so less material

needs to be smoked. “Artificial reefers” have in fact been produced for medical research by adding 
solvent-extracted THC to cellulose-based “cigarettes.” However, as noted in the following presenta-
tion, smoking cannabis is inconsistent with health promotion.
Purified cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids are often regarded as the ultimate path to 
responsible cannabis medications, but as noted in this chapter, they have not yet proven to be as 
consistently effective or acceptable to the majority of patients as cruder cannabis preparations.

MEDICAL MARIJUANA DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS
Aside from considerations of the inherent toxicity of cannabis is the issue of the relative safety (or 
harmfulness) of modes of drug delivery. Inhalation and oral ingestion are the most common meth-
ods of administration, but delivery can also be intrathecal (injected into the fluid surrounding the 
brain and spinal cord), intravenous, opthalmogic (ophthalmologic, i.e., by eye), rectal, vaginal, sub-
lingual (under the tongue), or transdermal. The production of novel pharmacological products that 
deliver cannabinoids efficiently is often considered to be a key to the future acceptance of medical 
marijuana. New pharmacological products for delivery of cannabinoids may be based on supposi-
tories, time release encapsulation, eye drops, nasal sprays, aerosols, topical ointments or creams, 
sublingual drops, transdermal patches, etc.

Conventional Smoking
“Smoking” is simply breathing in smoke (particulates and gases) from combustion. The heat from the 
fire in front of the herbal material that is set alight (located just back of the lit front of a joint or just 
underneath the burning material at the top of the bowl of a pipe) converts the THC-acid to free THC, as 
described in Chapter 11, and volatilizes the THC, which is inhaled with the smoke into the lungs. THC 
is very lipid-soluble, so it can easily cross the membranes of the alveoli (air sacs) and enter the blood in 
the pulmonary capillaries. The metabolized THC is rapidly carried to the heart and pumped to the brain.
One of the ways that cannabis is unique is that no other prescribed drug is administered by 
smoking (Mechoulam 2012). (Historically, in fact, tobacco was smoked occasionally for medical 
purposes.) The extremely serious health hazards of smoking tobacco are well known: bronchitis 
(inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the major airway leading to the lungs), emphysema 
(lung diseases damaging alveoli, leading to shortness of breath), lung cancer, heart disease, and 
numerous other disorders, including “bong lung” (Gill 2005). As a system for delivering the target 
chemical (nicotine in the case of tobacco), smoking of any herbal is likely to also deliver hundreds 
of toxins, and this unhealthy consequence is certain when marijuana is smoked (Tashkin 2002, 
2005, 2013; Reid et al. 2010; Owen et al. 2014). Moir et al. (2008) observed that as well as finding 
numerous of the same toxic compounds as in tobacco, “ammonia was found in mainstream mari-
juana smoke at levels up to 20-fold greater than that found in tobacco. Hydrogen cyanide, NO, NOx 
[NOx is a generic term for the mono-nitrogen oxides NO and NO2], and some aromatic amines were 
found in marijuana smoke at concentrations 3–5 times those found in tobacco smoke.”
Macleod and Hickman (2009) concluded that “cannabis use is almost certainly harmful, mainly 
because of its intimate relation to tobacco use,” and Kalant (2008) predicted that smoked marijuana had 
little future prospects for medicinal purposes. Many of the ingredients common to marijuana and tobacco 
smoke (including tar, carbon monoxide, aromatic hydrocarbons, hydrocyanic acid, oxides of nitrogen, 
acrolein, reactive aldehydes, several known carcinogens, and particulate matter such as naphthalene, 
dimethylphenol, and benzopyrene) are known to be toxic to respiratory tissue (Taylor 1988; Earleywine 
2010). Cannabis smokers inhale more deeply than tobacco smokers, resulting in greater exposure to 
combusted material per inhalation, but most cannabis users consume fewer cigarettes. Unfortunately, 
marijuana is generally smoked with tobacco in Europe, parts of Asia, North Africa, Australia, and 
New Zealand, although not usually in North America (Leggett 2006). The American Lung Association 
(2015) issued the following statement. “The ALA encourages continued research into the health effects 
of marijuana use, as the benefits, risks and safety of marijuana use for medical purposes require further 
study. Patients considering using marijuana for medicinal purposes should make this decision in consul-
tation with their doctor, and consider means of administration other than smoking.”
Sullivan et al. (2013) compared the efficacy of filtration techniques on reducing pesticide content 
in absorbed smoke. A handheld glass pipe allowed between 60% and 70% of pesticide residues to 
be absorbed. An unfiltered water pipe allowed 42% to 60% absorption. A cotton-filtered water pipe 
 

293
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
allowed only 0.1% to 11% absorption. While filtration can significantly reduce toxic pesticide resi-
dues, this does not necessarily reflect how well other classes of toxins are removed.
The issue of harm to pulmonary function from recreational smoking of marijuana was discussed 
in the previous chapter. The harm from smoking medical marijuana should not be equated with the 
harm likely resulting from regular smoking of recreational marijuana. Joshi et al. (2014) concluded, 
“Medicinal use of marijuana is likely not harmful to lungs in low cumulative doses.”
In the interests of harm reduction, it is preferable to utilize efficient systems that increase the pro-
portion of cannabinoids taken up while decreasing exposure to numerous other volatilized substances. 
Smoking cannabis preparations with an increased proportion of THC is the most common way of 
achieving this. Thus, high-THC buds and hashish can be considered “safer,” lowering the risk from the 
hazardous chemicals by reducing the amount of material that is smoked. Properly prepared hashish 
contains much higher levels of the cannabinoids than does marijuana (this is often not true in the illegal 
trade), and therefore, a smaller quantity needs to be consumed in comparison to marijuana. Accordingly, 
lesser amounts of toxins are absorbed in smoking, and at least in this limited sense, hashish is safer than 
marijuana. Whether smoking “safer” marijuana encourages unnecessary usage is another issue.
During the first decade of the twenty-first century, illicit marijuana has tended to increase in THC 
content in the United States, Netherlands, and United Kingdom (McLaren et al. 2008). The wide-
spread criticism that, because cannabis products in the illicit trade have increased in potency (THC 
content) during the past 20 years (Licata et al. 2005; Cascini et al. 2012), they are more dangerous, 
tends not to be taken seriously by informed pharmacologists. This is not only because higher-potency 
material means less material needs to be smoked, but also because cannabis dosage is autotitrated 
(self-regulated) by experienced users (novices are less able to limit their consumption to a desired 
point of satiety). According to Leggett (2006), “Unlike other drugs, it is virtually impossible to ‘over-
dose’ on cannabis.” (As noted later in the discussion of “dabbing,” this is no longer true.) Similarly, 
when consuming alcoholic beverages, whether beer, wine, or liquors, many experienced users tend 
to self-dose up to a particular level of intoxication, and the different concentrations of alcohol pres-
ent is of relatively limited importance. However, King et al. (2005) stated that “how far this parallel 
hold for cannabis is unknown,” and clearly, alcoholism and alcohol-based death indicates that some 
drinkers cannot limit their intake. Di Forti et al. (2009) intimated that high-potency marijuana may 
increase the risk of psychosis, but their study design was inadequate to show a causal relationship.
It is possible to smoke extracts, but because these are so concentrated, in the illicit culture they are 
generally diluted with tobacco or less concentrated marijuana. Street-available extracts can be very dan-
gerous, but properly made extracts can be free of contamination. In any event, it is far easier and safer 
to consume extracts by vaporization, described later in this chapter, than to attempt to smoke them.
Valsalva Maneuver and Prolonged Breath-Holding
Intuitively, breath-holding time and puff volume while smoking marijuana would seem to determine 
the amount of THC absorbed. Both assumptions have been questioned, particularly whether sus-
tained maintenance of smoke in the lungs increases the resulting degree of intoxication. The deep 
inhalation and prolonged holding of breath—the usual technique of smoking marijuana—create a 
Valsalva maneuver. The Valsalva maneuver (named for the seventeenth century Italian physician 
A.M. Valsalva) results from attempting to forcibly exhale while keeping the mouth and nose closed, 
thus closing the windpipe. This impedes the return of venous blood to the heart and is sometimes 
used to diagnose cardiac conditions. It is also employed to assess a variety of other pathological 
conditions. In diving and air travel, the technique is often used to equilibrate pressure issues for the 
ears and sinuses. The Valsalva maneuver has been speculated to rarely cause pneumothorax (collec-
tion of air within the chest, causing a lung to collapse), pneumomediastinum (collection of air in the 
middle portion of the chest), and lung disease (Hii et al. 2008; Lee and Hancox 2011).
The common conviction that prolonged breath-holding of marijuana smoke enhances the effects 
of marijuana has been disputed (Zacny and Chait 1989, 1991; Azorlosa et al. 1995; Earleywine 
2010). “Stoner” films regularly show the leading characters bravely holding in exaggerated puffs 
 

294
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
(they also feature poorly constructed plastic marijuana plants). The belief in breath-holding is so 
established that challenging it, as Earleywine (2010) pointed out, is likely to produce profound dis-
belief in the user community.
Water Pipes
Water pipes (devices to draw smoke through water; small contraptions are commonly called bongs, 
larger ones are hookahs; Figure 13.10; also see Figure 12.31) are widely employed by cannabis smok-
ers in order to filter out toxins created by combustion and reduce pulmonary irritation. The heat of 
smoking can have negative effects, such as inflammation, and because water pipes cool smoke, they 
may be advantageous in this respect (Earleywine 2010). Water also removes gas-phase smoke toxins, 
such as ammonia, acetaldehyde, benzene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrosamines, but 
is mostly ineffective against tars (polycyclic hydrocarbons) and particles in smoke (Bloor et al. 2008). 
Although THC is insoluble in water, the water nevertheless appears to trap some THC, leading to the 
need to smoke more when using a bong, with consequent increased intake of tars by comparison with 
smoking joints (Earleywine 2010). Gieringer (2001) stated, “studies have found that waterpipes and 
solid filters are ineffective at improving the THC/tar ratio in smoke.” Regardless of smoking tech-
nique, because of incomplete decarboxylation of THCA, loss through exhalation, and destruction by 
pyrolysis, a maximum of about 30% of the THC in cannabis preparations is absorbed (Russo 2007).
Vaporization
A smokeless pulmonary technique now extensively used in the consumption of cannabis drugs 
employs vaporization or volatilization, i.e., heating to produce steam or vapor without ignition or 
burning. Because the temperature is kept below the point of combustion where pyrolytic toxic com-
pounds are released, the production of irritating respiratory toxins is suppressed. Cannabinoids are 
quite volatile and will vaporize at temperatures much lower than the heat required to combust plant 
material. Vaporizers heat marijuana (usually buds or oil) to 180°C–190°C, vaporizing THC with-
out burning the plant material, producing a mist rather than “smoke.” These devices are likely to 
become especially widespread for medicinal usage. Vaporizers of the rechargeable battery-operated 
pen-type (electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes; Figure 13.11, right), which can be used either with 
vials of hash oil or solid concentrates, have become common for discreet consumption of illicit 
marijuana because they are inconspicuous and produce limited odor. However, Etter (2015) found 
that the conventional larger electronic vaporizers (such as the Volcano shown in Figure 13.11, left) 
were more popular than electronic cigarettes. The purity of the material employed is key to the 
degree of safety in using vaporization. The delivery of THC to the bloodstream by use of vaporizers 
is considered comparable to that achieved by conventional smoking.

295
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
Ruchlemer et al. (2007) concluded that “vaporization of cannabis is a safe and effective mode 
of delivery of THC.” Earleywine and Barnwell (2007) found comparatively reduced incidence of 
respiratory symptoms in users of vaporizers. However, inhaling the steam from vaporization does 
not eliminate all of the toxic materials produced. Low molecular toxic compounds such as ammonia 
tend to persist (Russo 2007; Bloor et al. 2008). Smith et al. (2015) studied the performance of the 
Volcano vaporizer and concluded: “Whilst the ‘Volcano’ device removes some toxic compounds 
from the smoke and reduces their inhalation by its user, it likely leads to enhanced ingestion of 
toxic ammonia known to result in neurobehavioral impairment.” Grant et al. (2012) commented, 
“Vaporization is not a perfect solution since carbon monoxide is formed, but levels are significantly 
lower than with smoking.”
oRAl consumpTIon
Cannabinoids can be consumed in foods (Figure 13.12). Because THC is lipophilic, orally con-
sumed cannabis is absorbed better by the intestinal mucosa if some fat is ingested simultaneously 
(this is usually accomplished by adding a fatty liquid, such as cream to cannabis tea, or considerable 
butter when baked in brownies; animal lard and vegetable oils are also used). Brownies, candies, 
and cookies seem to be most popular. Teas (usually “decoctions,” which are boiled preparations) 
and juices have proven useful, despite the notable limited solubility of THC in water. Chapter 12 
provides information on how cannabinoids are added to common foods. Oral consumption in the 
form of foods or tinctures is a way of avoiding all lung problems, and during the nineteenth century, 
oral use was common both for medical and recreational use. However, becoming “high” from oral 
consumption is notoriously slow and comparatively unreliable. The speed of absorption of THC in 
the stomach depends on stomach contents and the presence of coingested drugs. Some degradation 
of THC by acids in the stomach and gut may occur.
Smoking produces effects within seconds to minutes, with a maximum from about 10 to 30 min-
utes and a duration of two or three hours, but with wide interindividual variation (Huestis 2005). 
THC can be detected immediately in plasma after the first puff. The rapid action of smoking is

due to THC being transported quickly to the brain. By contrast, eating does not produce effects for 
30 minutes to three hours, and the effects are relatively prolonged, lasting five to eight hours or even 
longer. (Eating raw cannabis material that has not been heated to decarboxylate the acidic form of 
THC will produce only a minimal euphoric effect.) The slow action of orally ingested THC is due 
to its being transported from the stomach to the liver, where it is converted to 11-hydroxy-THC, a 
more potent and longer-lasting cannabinoid than THC. The more rapid onset and predictable decay 
of effects from smoking facilitates self-titration of dosing, in contrast to oral ingestion. Smoking and 
eating modes of metabolizing THC are contrasted in Figure 13.13.

“syntho-cannabinoids.” The following two (Figure 13.14) have been marketed commercially for sev-
eral decades. Dronabinol is the synthetically manufactured (-)-trans-isomer of Δ9-THC. Marinol is 
a dronabinol preparation, dissolved in sesame oil, provided as capsules. It is a registered trademark 
of Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, and is available in North 
America and some European countries. Nabilone is a synthetic derivative of Δ9-THC with a slightly 
modified molecular structure. It is marketed under the name Cesamet, a registered trademark of 
ICN Canada Ltd., and is available in Canada, in the United States (through Valeant Pharmaceuticals 
International), and some European countries. These synthetic preparations of THC are expensive 
and are often considered to be less effective than simply smoking preparations of marijuana.
Rimonabant (the generic version of the trade pharmaceutical Accomplia; also trademarked as 
Zimulti) is a CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist (discussed later in this chapter), marketed for 
FIGURE 13.14 Synthetic (“cannabimimetic”) cannabinoids. Left: Marinol (brand of dronabinol), a syn-

a means of losing weight, it was widely and rather luridly advertised under various brand names in dozens of 
countries. Unscrupulous marketers still provide it by Internet sales. Prepared by B. Brookes.

several years as an appetite suppressant (Figure 13.15). By blocking endocannabinoid receipt in the 
brain, this synthetic chemical proved useful for weight loss and obesity control. Indeed, not only 
did the drug reduce weight and decrease waist size, it also increased high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (good cholesterol), decreased triglycerides, improved glucose tolerance and insulin levels, 
and seemed to help in cessation of smoking. Because of potential psychiatric side effects, includ-
ing anxiety, depression, nausea, seizures, and (particularly) suicide, the drug was discontinued in 
Europe in 2006, the main region where it was sold (Bermudez-Silva et al. 2010).
Paradoxically, in view of the well-known ability of marijuana to stimulate appetite, Le Foll et al. 
(2013) showed that the prevalence of obesity is much lower in cannabis users compared to nonusers 
(see later discussion of obesity). It would of course be irresponsible to suggest that smoking mari-
juana is a reasonable way to lose excess weight.
deRmAl And mucosAl dRug AbsoRpTIon
“Skin” is a protective layer covering most of the outer body. Cannabinoids can be absorbed into 
the skin by topical (external) application; hence, concern has been expressed about the possible 
unintended absorption of THC through the skin because of the presence of contaminating THC in 
hempseed oil used in cosmetics, as described in Chapter 8. In fact, epidermal cannabinoid patches 
and gels are available commercially to deliberately absorb THC through the skin.
A different kind of protective layer, mucosal tissue, lines most internal body passages, notably 
occurring in the nose, lips, digestive tract, urinary system, genitals, and anus. These tissues are 
moist, secreting mucus to protect against infection. Mucosal absorption of cannabinoids is much 
more efficient than application to the skin (and is vastly more likely to produce intense psychoactiv-
ity from an overdose). Sativex (Figure 13.6), the cannabinoid-based analgesic supplied by the U.K. 
firm GW Pharmaceuticals, applies cannabinoids through mucosal tissues in the mouth. Ben Amar 
(2006) described Sativex as “a compromise between the inhaled and oral routes.” The cannabinoids 
are diffused into tiny blood vessels, entering the bloodstream directly (like smoking), unlike oral 
consumption, which exposes the cannabinoids to the digestive tract and subsequently to the liver, 
with the resulting issues described previously. Suppositories are occasionally used as a form of THC 
absorption through the mucosal tissues in the rectum (see “Curiosities of Science, Technology, and 
Human Behavior” at the end of this chapter). Rectal absorption is more constant than oral absorp-
tion. A patent for the medical use of suppositories to administer THC was issued to ElSohly (1995). 
Vaginal application is also possible, and cannabinoid sprays for this purpose are being marketed, with 
claims that they produce extraordinary sexual sensation. Unless manufactured to precise standards 
and employed under the care of experienced health professionals, such products may be dangerous.
THC DOSAGES, ABSORPTION RATES, AND TIME COURSE OF EFFECTS
bIoAvAIlAbIlITy
The relative amount of THC absorbed (bioavailability) during smoking has been claimed to be as 
high as 70%, depending on losses in combustion and sidestream smoke (Hall and Solowij 1998). 
Commonly, much of the THC is lost as smoke that is not inhaled and in vapor that is exhaled 
after inhalation. Bioavailability of inhaled THC is affected by volume inhaled, depth of inhalation 
into the lungs, and length of time that the breath is held (but note earlier contradictory viewpoints 
regarding this), retaining the smoke in the alveoli (Grotenhermen 2004a). The intensity of subjec-
tive effects is directly proportional to the puff volume and frequency (Azorlosa et al. 1992, 1995). 
In most circumstances, from 5% to 25% of the THC in marijuana is absorbed by smoking (Agurell 
et al. 1986; Holubek 2010; Strougo et al. 2008). Oral bioavailability ranges from 5%–20% of dose 
(Huestis 2005), usually less than 15% (Bowles et al. 2012).
 

299

dosAges
THC is very potent in humans, causing a “high” at a dose of 10 μg/kg through smoking, 30–50 μg/
kg after intravenous injection, and 120 μg/kg from ingestion. A THC concentration in marijuana 
of approximately 0.9% has been suggested as a practical minimum level to achieve an intoxicant 
effect, but, as discussed later, CBD (the predominant cannabinoid of fiber and oilseed varieties) 
antagonizes (i.e., reduces) and potentiates (modifies) the effects of THC. Concentrations of 0.3% to 
0.9% are considered to have “only a small drug potential” (Grotenhermen and Karus 1998).
Specifying the amount of marijuana that should be consumed in order to become high is 
subject to several difficulties. Experienced smokers are often capable of accessing about twice 
as much THC as casual users because they have developed a superior inhalation technique. 
Individuals differ in their response to marijuana, and heavy users can develop tolerance, so 
larger amounts may be necessary. Female patients with higher estrogen levels have been found 
to be relatively sensitive to the effects of medical cannabis (Lopez 2010). According to Leggett 
(2006), “a cannabis cigarette should not be considered a ‘dose.’ Consumption of an entire can-
nabis cigarette in a single sitting by a casual user would be rare, rather like a casual drinker 
consuming an entire bottle of wine. Cannabis of reasonable quality is actually more like spir-
its: just a few ‘shots’ is enough to produce intoxication.” A “hit” (inhalation) or two of high-
potency cannabis is effective in producing a “buzz,” and several hits usually suffice during a 
session. Smoking 0.05–0.1 mg of high-quality cannabis (with 15% THC) is sufficient to become 
high (Leggett 2006), so a 0.5-mg joint would normally be consumed sequentially over sev-
eral sessions by one person or simultaneously by several people. (The U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration employs 0.5 g of cannabis as representative of a cannabis cigarette.) Average 
consumption of 1 g/day is not unusual among regular users. For medical use or for those who 
choose to be more or less continuously intoxicated, consumption of as much as 5–10 g/day/
person has been reported.
phARmAcokIneTIcs
“Pharmacokinetics” is the study of the time course of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion (more generally, “pharmacodynamics” is the study of how drugs affect the biochem-
istry and physiology of the body). Grotenhermen (2003) stated that “Pulmonary assimilation of 
inhaled THC causes a maximum plasma concentration within minutes, psychotropic effects start 
within seconds to a few minutes, reach a maximum after 15–30 minutes, and taper off within two 
to three hours. Following oral ingestion, psychotropic effects set in with a delay of 30–90 minutes, 
reach their maximum after two to three hours and last for about 4–12 hours, depending on dose 
and specific effect.” Similarly, Abrams and Guzman (2014) observed that “When taken by mouth, 
there is a low (6%–20%) and variable oral bioavailability. Peak plasma concentrations occur after 
one to six hours and remain elevated with a terminal half-life of 20–30 hours. When consumed 
orally, delta-9-THC is initially metabolized in the liver to 11-OH-THC, also a potent psychoac-
tive metabolite. On the other hand, when inhaled, the cannabinoids are rapidly absorbed into the 
bloodstream with a peak concentration in 2–10 minutes, which rapidly declines over the next 30 
minutes. Thus, smoking achieves a higher peak concentration with a shorter duration of effect. 
Less of the psychoactive 11-OH-THC metabolite is formed.” Grotenhermen et al. (2005) came to 
the following conclusions (cf. Armentano 2013). After smoking “typical medium to strong doses” 
of 15–20 mg THC, peak THC levels in blood occur 5–10 minutes after inhalation, and a waiting 
period of about three hours after smoking seems sufficient to reduce THC level to below a THC 
blood level of 5 ng/mL. Typical oral doses in social settings are in the 10–20 mg range, the effects 
occurring later than do those of smoking, usually peaking two to three hours after ingestion, and 
usually decreasing below the level of 5 ng/mL THC of blood in four hours.

Grotenhermen et al. (2007) found that “Limited epidemiological studies indicate that serum con-
centrations of THC below 10 ng/ml are not associated with an elevated accident risk. A comparison 
of meta-analyses of experimental studies on the impairment of driving-relevant skills by alcohol 
or cannabis suggests that a THC concentration in the serum of 7–10 ng/ml is correlated with an 
impairment comparable to that caused by a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%.” However, it is 
difficult to reliably associate serum concentration and the degree of impairment as is done with 
alcohol (Zuurman et al. 2009). The state of Colorado, after authorizing the use of recreational mari-
juana, set a legal maximum limit for driving an automobile of 5 ng/mL THC of blood (many other 
states have zero tolerance).
THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM AS A BASIS 
FOR MUCH OF THE MEDICAL VALUE OF MARIJUANA
oveRvIew of The endocAnnAbInoId sysTem
The endocannabinoid system (often abbreviated as ECS, or shortened to eCB system) is a “com-
mand and control” set of biochemical communication regulatory mechanisms dealing with THC-
like substances (endocannabinoids) produced naturally by the human body in general and the brain 
in particular, where receptors (discussed later) are concentrated in areas associated with thinking, 
memory, coordination, pleasure, and time perception. Like an automobile that has multiple systems 
requiring regulation (cooling, lubrication, electrical, etc.), the body has several systems to regulate 
physiological homeostasis, i.e., to maintain the orderly expression of different functional units to 
achieve a stable balance. For example, temperature, hormones, and energy levels of the body all 
require stabilization. The ECS is one of the important biological control systems. “The cannabinoid 
system helps regulate the function of major systems in the body, making it an integral part of the 
central homeostatic modulatory system—the check-and-balance molecular signalling networks that 
keeps the human body…healthy” (Aggarwal et al. 2009). “The modulation of the endocannabinoid 
system has therapeutic potential in a wide range of disparate diseases and pathologic conditions that 
affect humans, including neurodegenerative, kidney, and gastrointestinal diseases, pain, cancer, 
bone and cardiovascular disorders, obesity and metabolic syndrome, and inflammation, just to men-
tion a few” (Horváth et al. 2012).
Virtually every organ system of the human body (Figure 13.16) is directly or indirectly influ-
enced by the ECS. Moreover, as reviewed by McPartland et al. (2014) (also see McPartland 
2008a), the system can be influenced by numerous factors: (1) pharmaceuticals such as analge-
sics (including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and glucocor-
ticoids), antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants; (2) psychoactive 
substances, including alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and cannabis; (3) clinical interventions, includ-
ing complementary and alternative medicine such as massage and manipulation, acupuncture, 
dietary supplements, and herbal medicines; (4) diet; and (5) lifestyle modification, including 
exercise and weight control. Given such extensive regulation of virtually all facets of the human 
body, and the numerous ways of modifying the controls, the significance of the ECS for human 
health can scarcely be exaggerated.
The human ECS is made up of cannabinoid receptors (notably CB1 and CB2), endocannabi-
noids (notably anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol [2-AG]), the biosynthetic precursors of the 
endocannabinoids, and the mechanisms (particularly the enzymes) involved in their biosynthesis 
and catabolism (inactivation) (Izzo et al. 2009). Information on these components of the ECS is 
presented in this section. As explained in the following discussion, the cannabinoids of C. sativa 
mimic the body’s functionally similar molecules in binding to and activating (or neutralizing) tiny 
molecular receptor molecules embedded in the membranous surfaces of cells.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
There are well over 10,000 scientific publications dealing with the ECS, most of them very tech-
nical. The following discussion of the workings of the ECS and how it is affected by cannabinoids 
from the marijuana plants is a simplified overview. For a recent comprehensive technical review, 
see Mechoulam et al. (2014).
InTRoducTIon To cell RecepToRs And g pRoTeIn-coupled RecepToRs
The biochemistry of cannabinoid action in humans is best understood in terms of how they affect 
cell receptors. Receptors are proteins, located in the cell membrane or inside the cell, which respond 
to chemicals in their environment by altering metabolic functions within the cell. In the early 1970s, 
opiate receptors were discovered in the brain, which bind to molecules produced naturally by the 
body but also bind to morphine and other opiates that are consumed. Analogous to the discovery 
of opiate receptors, in the 1990s, a system was discovered in which cannabinoid cell receptors 
responded both to internally produced molecules and also the cannabinoids of cannabis that are 
absorbed. Receptors are usually named after the endogenous molecules that activate them, such as 
dopamine for dopamine receptors or serotonin for serotonin receptors.
“Cannabinoid receptors” are also called “endocannabinoid receptors.” Chemically, molecules that 
bind to cellular receptors are called ligands; pharmacologically, chemicals contacting and activating 
receptors are agonists. Full agonists maximally activate receptors. Partial agonists do so partially. 
Neutral antagonists dock at receptors but do not activate them. Inverse agonists (antagonists) deacti-
vate or prevent activation of receptors by displacing agonists and by suppressing “endogenous tone” 
and “constitutive activity” (both explained later in the section Endocannabinoid Receptors). Thus, a 
particular chemical docking at a receptor site can be stimulative or depressive. The different kinds of 
agonists have varying degrees of utility in manipulating the ECS. The use of an inverse agonist like 
rimonabant can have rather drastic effects, such as lowering the baseline activity of the ECS.
An analysis of terminology related to the ECS is presented by Di Marzo and De Petrocellis 
(2014), who attempt to provide more narrow definitions of some terms than usually encountered in 
the literature. For example, they dislike the term “cannabinoid receptor” mostly in use for the CB1 
and CB2 receptors, since (as discussed later) cannabinoids affect other targets.
A particular chemical with drug properties, produced by a plant, may fortuitously mimic a nat-
ural chemical that the body employs to regulate cell functions through the receptor system. Plants 
produce a countless array of chemicals, and it is probably just coincidence that the cannabinoids 
of C. sativa just happen to have architectural (structural) features and ionic properties (distribu-
tion of electrical charges) that can activate the cannabinoid receptors of humans. In Figure 13.17, 
this kind of fortuitous relationship is conceptualized as analogous molecules with drug proper-
ties, whether originating from a plant or the human body, influencing the same cell receptor sites 
because of a sort of lock-and-key compatibility (receptors are analogous to locks; endocannabi-
noids and cannabinoids from Cannabis are analogous to keys). In the case of the ECS described 
here, the traditional lock-and-key metaphor is an oversimplification: different keys (chemicals) 
may have different degrees of fit into the lock, and cellular response depends on which kind of cell 
the lock is located.
The endocannabinoid receptors belong to a group called “G protein-coupled receptors” (illus-
trated in Figure 13.18). “G protein” is short for guanine nucleotide binding protein, the type of 
molecule that is normally attached but detaches when the receptor is stimulated, initiating a chain of 
biochemical events. G protein-coupled receptors are important in many diseases and are the target 
of about 40% of pharmaceuticals. This class of receptors includes numerous varieties of proteins 
that weave through cell membranes seven times (hence, they are also called seven-transmembrane 
receptors). G protein-coupled receptors function as intracellular molecular switches, possessing a 
unique binding pocket that “senses” or responds particularly to molecules docking in the pocket, 
and consequently, the external molecules transmit signals to the interior of the cell, triggering cel-
lular responses.
 

303
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
The mechanism of this “sensing” involves the docking causing a distortion of the protein that 
weaves seven times through the membrane, in turn producing a decoupling of the attached G pro-
tein inside the cell, which initiates biochemical events such as a flow of ions or the release of 
hormones, consequently influencing cell behavior. The type of detachable protein determines the 
kind of biochemical process that is triggered, and different types of cells can utilize a given recep-
tor for different purposes by coupling to particular proteins. The body is known to possess thou-
sands of G protein-coupled receptors, well-known types including dopamine, opioid, serotonin, and 
β-adrenergic receptors. Cannabinoid receptors are the most common kind of G protein-coupled 
receptor in the brain.
endocAnnAbInoIds
From the perspective of the human body, the cannabinoids of the cannabis plant are “exogenous” 
(i.e., derived externally), while its own cannabinoids (“endocannabinoids”) are “endogenous” (origi-
nating internally). The endocannabinoids are derivatives of fatty acids and are relatively unrelated 
chemically to the cannabinoids of C. sativa (although the cannabinoids of C. sativa and the endo-
cannabinoids of humans are all “lipids”). Although the chemical formulae of endocannabinoids are 
quite different from those of the cannabinoids of C. sativa, the three-dimensional structures of the 
two classes are thought to be quite similar, accounting for how marijuana cannabinoids can influ-
ence the human body’s receptors.
There are two principal endocannabinoids. Arachidonylethanolamide or N-arachidonoyl-
ethanolamine, mercifully nicknamed anandamide or AEA, exists particularly in the human nervous 
system and mimics the action of THC by influencing cannabinoid receptors. (The word anandamide 
was coined from “ananda,” the Sanskrit word for “bliss” or “supreme joy,” and “amide,” meaning 
carboxylic acid derivatives.) Another chemical, later discovered to have similar effects on cannabi-
noid receptors, was coined 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG for short). Both of these endocannabinoids 
activate the CB1 and CB2 receptors discussed in the next section.

Other known endocannabinoids (also capable of activating the CB1 and CB2 receptors) include 
2-arachidonoyl glycerol ether, O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (virodhamine), and N-arachidonoyl 
dopamine (Pacher et al. 2006). Lysophosphatidylinositol has been suggested to also be an endocan-
nabinoid (it too activates CB1 and CB2 receptors and also seems to influence a putative cannabinoid 
receptor; Piñeiro and Falasca 2012).
Synthesis and release of endocannabinoids are induced “on demand” by physiological or patho-
logical stimuli. Cannabinoid receptors are subsequently activated, resulting in adaptive (or in some 
disease conditions possibly inadaptive) responses.

FIGURE 13.18 A simplified interpretation of the similar actions of Cannabis-based and human-based can-
nabinoids. Left: a molecule of Δ9-THC, the chief natural cannabinoid of C. sativa, is shown contacting and 
affecting a type CB1 receptor embedded in the human cell membrane at bottom (note the characteristic struc-
ture of this polypeptide chain—a portion outside the membrane, winding through the membrane seven times, 
and a portion inside the membrane). Right: a molecule of anandamide, one of the chief natural endocannabi-
noids of the human body’s internal cannabinoid system, similarly contacts and affects a type CB1 receptor. 
The discovery that the cannabinoids of C. sativa affect (either positively or negatively) the human brain and 
other organs of the body through the internal endocannabinoid control system of the human body provides 
indisputable evidence that marijuana has medicinal properties (but not necessarily warranting medical usage).

respond to the cannabinoids from C. sativa, they appear to routinely function mainly in response 
to endocannabinoids, produced by the body’s metabolism (Grotenhermen 2003, 2004a,b; Onaivi 
et al. 2005). Cannabinoid receptors have been identified in nerve terminals in the central nervous 
system, as well as in peripheral tissues, including sympathetic ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, adrenal 
glands, heart, lung, urinary bladder, reproductive tissues, gastrointestinal tissues, and immune cells. 
Cannabis drugs and extracts exert many of their biological functions through the receptors. Many 
of the potential therapeutic uses for cannabis drugs are related to the ways the drugs act on the can-
nabinoid receptors and how this influences human physiology (Joy et al. 1999; Onaivi et al. 2005b).
There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors: CB1 receptors, which are more numerous 
in the brain, particularly play neuromodulatory roles (i.e., they control nerve cell operations), and 
CB2 receptors, which are best known for immunomodulatory functions (i.e., they control immune 
cell operations). The CB1 receptor was discovered in 1991, and the CB2 in 1993 (Pertwee et al. 2010). 
The CB1 receptor contains 472 amino acids, while the CB2 receptor has 360 (Sugiura et al. 2005). 
Only a few natural cannabinoids of C. sativa have been found to be capable of activating the recep-
tors, of which the following (which produce euphoria in humans) are most significant. Δ9-THC is a 
partial activator of both receptors but is more potent at CB1 receptors than at CB2 receptors (Pertwee 
et al. 2010). Δ8-THC also activates the CB1 receptors but is slightly less potent than Δ9-THC, and 
it probably also activates CB2 receptors (Pertwee and Cascio 2014). Cannabinol (CBN) binds less 
potently to both receptors than either Δ9-THC or Δ8-THC (Pertwee and Cascio 2014). In addition 
to these three cannabinoids, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) affects both receptors. “No other 
phytocannabinoid investigated to date has been reported to activate CB1 or CB2 receptors with sig-
nificant potency” (Cascio and Pertwee 2014).
Panlilio et al. (2015) summarized the activities of THC as follows: “The actions of THC at CB1 
receptors are considered to be critical for its psychoactive effects, but THC also acts at peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptors and GPR55 receptors.” CBD does not bind significantly either to 
CB1 or CB2 receptors, but there can be complex indirect effects (Pertwee 2008; Pertwee et al. 
2010; Cascio and Pertwee 2014; Laprairie et al. 2015). CBD and indeed other nonpsychotropic 
(noneuphoric) cannabinoids have significant pharmacological actions on the human body that are 
independent of the ECS (Cascio and Pertwee 2014). (As pointed out elsewhere in this chapter, the 
psychotropic cannabinoids also have significant therapeutic potential independent of the ECS.)
The two kinds of receptors have somewhat different distributions, but collectively, they are in 
virtually all organs and body tissues. CB1 receptors are the most abundant G-coupled receptors in 
the mammalian brain and they are the primary sites of action of THC taken into the human body. 
Human brains can contain as many as 100 billion neurons, which communicate electrochemically 
by means of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers), notably dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. 
CB1 receptors and the endocannabinoids (which are neurotransmitters) that affect them appear to 
play key roles in regulating the actions of the other neurotransmitters. Within the brain, the distribu-
tion of CB1 receptors is consistent with the known effects of cannabinoids on cognition, memory, 
and motor function. The distribution of CB1 receptors with respect to pain pathways in the brain, 
spinal cord, and on terminals of peripheral nervous system primary afferent neurons is also con-
sistent with cannabinoid-induced analgesia. The male and female reproductive systems, bones, and 
indeed most body tissues are also home to CB1 receptors, albeit in lower concentration than in ner-
vous tissues. In the central nervous system, where CB1 receptors are particularly densely distributed, 
they are responsible for such effects of marijuana as catalepsy (a nervous condition characterized 
by muscular rigidity and postural fixity), depression of motor activity, antinociception (decreased 
sensitivity to pain), analgesia, and feelings of well-being. In peripheral neurons, activation of the 
CB1 receptors suppresses neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) release to the heart, bladder, intes-
tines, and vas deferens. CB1 receptors particularly affect brain functions and so are important in 
the medical consideration of psychiatric and memory diseases. CB1 receptors also play key roles 
in regulating diseases related to pain, itching, muscle tone, and gastrointestinal functions such as 
digestion, secretion, and propulsion.

CB2 receptors occur in nonneural tissue, especially in the spleen and immune system (hence 
their importance for anti-inflammatory functions), but to a lesser degree in the brain, pancreas, 
and liver. The distribution of CB2 receptors on peripheral and central immune cells (such as in 
the spleen, thymus, tonsils, bone marrow lymph nodes, tonsils, and white blood cells) has been 
hypothesized to modulate immune effects of THC, through release of cytokines (proteins that are 
important in cell signaling, including some that act as chemical switches, turning certain immune 
cell types on and off).
CB2 receptors particularly affect immunosuppression, and so are important in the medical con-
sideration of numerous diseases and malfunctions of physiological systems, including inflammation 
(Croxford and Yamamura 2005; Basu and Dittel 2011). CB2 receptors are also thought to affect 
disorders characterized by development of scar tissue (fibrosis), such as in liver cirrhosis, and to 
affect certain heart and kidney disorders. Indeed, an astonishing range of human maladies rang-
ing from cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, bone, skin, 
autoimmune and lung conditions, as well as pain and cancer, have been correlated with changes in 
endocannabinoid levels and/or CB2 receptor expression (Pacher and Mechoulam 2011).
The expression of more or fewer receptors on cells is influenced by stresses. At least in some 
circumstances, increased numbers of receptors seems adaptive. Disease conditions may be accom-
panied either by more or by fewer cell receptors. A particularly interesting example is the study 
of Hirvonen et al. (2012), who demonstrated that chronic smoking in people was correlated with 
downregulation (decrease) of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in certain brain regions but that this could 
be reversed by cessation of smoking.
Cannabinoid receptors (indeed, other classes of receptors) may be active to a degree despite the 
absence of cannabinoids (either endogenous or exogenous)—termed “constitutive activity”—and 
this may be difficult to distinguish from “endogenous tone,” the relative efficacy or degree of func-
tional balance of the ECS (for discussion, see Howlett et al. 2011).
For many years, CB1 and CB2 receptors were thought to have quite separate distributions, but 
more recently, CB2 receptors were found to occur in brain tissues (Pamplona and Takahashi 2012).
There is evidence that there are additional cannabinoid receptors (which could be labeled CB3, 
etc.), but their status is not yet certain (Pamplona and Takahashi 2012). Prominent among these can-
didate cannabinoid receptors is GPR55, a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor, which 
however does not meet current criteria employed to define cannabinoid receptors (Cabral et al. 2015). 
Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1; aka the capsaicin receptor) is also often viewed 
as an ion channel (rather than a G-protein-coupled) cannabinoid receptor (Tóth et al. 2009).
InTeRcellulAR communIcATIon InvolvIng endocAnnAbInoIds
Nerve cells (neurons) of the brain and other parts of the nervous system communicate with each 
other by transmission of chemical or electrical messages across very shallow interneuron gaps. Such 
messages regulate and coordinate key functions such as appetite, memory, movement, and pain. A 
variety of messaging systems exist, and usually the stimulus arises entirely in one nerve cell and 
is transmitted directly to an adjoining nerve cell at a synapse. (Some employ the term “synapse” to 
refer to the gap [synaptic cleft] across which messages flow between nerve cells; more properly, the 
term also denotes the working parts of the adjacent neurons, i.e., the presynaptic and postsynaptic 
portions, as well as the synaptic cleft.)
The function of the ECS in the central nervous system is to dampen release of neurotransmit-
ters. The receiving neuron has the capability of suppressing the message from its partner neuron (a 
so-called “retrograde feedback” or “upstream” or “backward arrangement”). As shown in Figure 
13.19, the receiving (postsynaptic) membrane of a nerve cell synthesizes endocannabinoids (from 
phospholipids), which migrate across the synaptic gap to the transmitting (presynaptic) end of an 
adjoining nerve cell. Activation of the presynaptic CB1 receptors decreases intracellular signaling 
ions (Ca2+) which are required for release of stored intercellular cationic neurotransmitters from 
 

307
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
vesicles in the presynaptic neuron. In short, this sequence of events suppresses the chemical signal 
between nerve cells. (For a technical account, see Reggio 2005.)
Most “classical” neurotransmitters (examples include acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin) are 
stored in vesicles in the presynaptic portion of a transmitting neuron, awaiting need (as shown in 
Figure 13.19). The endocannabinoid anandamide is not stored in the receiving neuron but is synthe-
sized in the postsynaptic end of the receiving neuron and released on demand following stimulation. 
(The other major endocannabinoid, 2-AG, is almost universally thought to also follow this retrograde 
arrangement, but this awaits confirmation; Mechoulam and Parker 2013a). Mechoulam (2004) noted, 
“In many respects, the endocannabinoids differ from the classical modulatory molecules. They are 
not stored waiting for a customer. They are both formed and released on demand. They seem to act 
mostly (but not exclusively) within their anatomical vicinity and their actions are mediated (again 
mostly) by presynaptic, rather than by postsynaptic receptors, as with the classical neurotransmitters.”
It appears that the postsynaptic neuron recognizes that the presynaptic neuron is send-
ing too much signal and sends endocannabinoids to the former to decrease or halt transmission. 
Hyperstimulation of a postsynaptic neuron can degrade and even kill it (a phenomenon termed 
“excitotoxicity”). The endocannabinoid receptors have been compared to a dimmer switch, limiting 
or stimulating the amount of neurotransmitter released, thereby affecting how messages are sent, 
received, and processed. An illustration of how this might be useful is provided by the following 
example. Neuropathic or nerve-based pain is associated with many diseases (including diabetes,

FIGURE 13.19 A simplified representation of endocannabinoid-based retrograde chemical message transmis-
sion at a synapse between nerve cells. Effectively, the endocannabinoid receptor (type CB1) is functioning as a 
dimmer switch or surge protector, responding to chemical signals from the receiving cell, instructing the sending 
cell to dampen down its signal. (A) The receiving neuron synthesizes endocannabinoids from lipid precursors 
in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron and these migrate across the synaptic cleft (gap) between the nerve 
cells to cannabinoid receptors of the transmitting neuron. (B) The endocannabinoids communicate with the 
presynaptic cannabinoid receptors, which are activated. (C) Activation of the CB receptors releases chemicals, 
decreasing signaling ions (Ca2+) which are required for release of stored neurotransmitters from vesicles in the 
presynaptic neuron. (D) This suppresses the supply of neurotransmitters migrating to the postsynaptic neuron 
across the synaptic cleft and decreases the activation of receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. (E) Decreased 
activation of neurotransmitter receptors decreases triggering of cellular activity (F) in the postsynaptic neuron.

human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/AIDS, and multiple sclerosis [MS]). The pain is produced 
by several neurotransmitters, including glutamate. To relieve excessive pain, the endocannabinoids 
act to limit glutamate release (too much glutamate can cause neurons to die). As noted later, such 
needless pain may be one of the targets of cannabinoid therapy.
The ECS is not limited to damping down an activity, although this seems to be its major function. 
Stimulation of some neurons (“inhibitory neurons”) causes them to dampen down an activity, and when 
such neurons are damped down by the ECS, the result is that some activity is stimulated (such “synaptic 
disinhibition” is due to a sort of double negative producing a positive effect). Thus, the ECS is endowed 
with flexibility (“synaptic plasticity”) facilitating complex mental functions such as learning and memory.
The previous discussion has concentrated on how CB1 receptors suppress excessive stimulative 
activity from one cell to another to prevent damage to that receiving neuron. This is the main function 
of CB1 receptors—to prevent damage to the brain and peripheral nerves from uncontrolled stimula-
tion. Analogously, CB2 receptors, which are primarily in cells associated with the immune system, 
prevent damage by suppressing signaling from sending neurons to immune cells. Immune cells have 
varied functions but often stimulate “inflammation” while contributing to a fight against infection. 
Normal inflammation is largely a localized response, where the body (particularly its immune cells) 
is trying to fight off infective agents, respond to chemical irritants, or remove dead or dying cells 
that have been injured. The immune system may produce protective compounds (a sort of chemical 
warfare) to ward off germs, which is desirable to a degree, but if done excessively, the result may be 
damage to innocent body tissues. (Autoimmune diseases, as discussed later, illustrate the danger of 
excessive inflammation.) Excessive inflammation can cause tissue damage, pain, and retardation of 
healing. Physicians conventionally prescribe pharmaceuticals to dampen down excessive inflamma-
tion (such as corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]), and one day, they 
may prescribe cannabinoids to mimic the body’s natural inflammation-reducing endocannabinoids. 
A highly simplified interpretation of how the CB1 and CB2 receptors function as signal suppressors is 
shown in Figure 13.20.

The bRoAd RAnge of compounds AffecTIng The endocAnnAbInoId sysTem
In the section “Expanded Definitions of Cannabinoids” in Chapter 11, it was pointed out that some 
researchers have expanded the meaning of cannabinoids to include not only the cannabinoids of the 
cannabis plant, the endocannabinoids of humans (and other animals), but also chemicals that do 
not directly interact with the endocannabinoid receptors but do influence endocannabinoid func-
tion. Higher (flowering) plants do not have ECSs. However, a considerable number of chemicals 
produced by higher plants have been discovered to influence the CB receptors of humans (Gertsch 
et al. 2010). Anandamide, the first-discovered endocannabinoid in humans (Devane et al. 1992), 
critically affects brain functioning, and THC exerts its effects by substituting for it. Anandamide’s 
tone (functionality) is affected by N-linoleoylethanolamide and N-oleoylethanolamide, which are 
found in a number of plants, most interestingly in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), the source of choco-
late, partially supporting the intuitive belief of many that the euphoric experiences from consum-
ing chocolate and marijuana have some similarities (these chemicals do not directly affect the CB 
receptors but exemplify indirect effects). (The major endocannabinoid anandamide occurs in milk 
and therefore could be present in milk chocolate, but not in amounts that could produce observable 
psychotropic effects; Di Marzo et al. 1998). Gertsch et al. (2010) provide other examples of plant 
constituents that directly or indirectly affect CB receptors. These authors point out that THC is the 
most potent phytocannabinoid activator of the CB1 receptor yet discovered.
Animals have chemicals that can influence ECSs of unrelated species. The stimulating mole-
cules produced within a given species that regulate (activate or deactivate) its own ECS are in many 
cases capable of influencing the ECS of quite unrelated species.
In addition to anandamide and 2-AG, the two well-known primary endocannabinoids, the human 
body produces a range of chemicals that on their own do not affect the CB receptors but boost the effects 
of anandamide and 2-AG (a demonstration of the “entourage effect” discussed previously in this chap-
ter). Some endocannabinoid specialists include these chemicals under the term “endocannabinoid.”
effecTs of cAnnAbInoIds on nonendocAnnAbInoId physIologIcAl sysTems
“The current knowledge about cannabinoid receptors has been associated with mediating most of 
the psychoactive effects of marijuana, other neurobehavioral alterations, and the bulk of the cellular, 
biochemical, and physiological effects of cannabinoids” (Onaivi et al. 2005b). Nevertheless, while 
the ECS appears to be the primary way that cannabinoids directly exert physiological effects in 
humans, cannabinoids also affect other (“off target”) receptor systems (particularly vanilloid recep-
tors). The receptor TRPV1, known for reacting to capsaicin, the active ingredient of chile pepper, 
also responds to anandamide and CBD, although not to THC (Cabral et al. 2015). As noted earlier, 
it has been proposed to be part of the ECS.
Cannabinoids can also influence metabolism through nonreceptor mechanisms. Cannabis sativa 
and several of its cannabinoids have been shown to be antibacterial (Ferenczy et al. 1958; Kabelik 
et al. 1960; Radosevic et al. 1962; Gal and Vajda 1970; Farkas and Andrassy 1976; Van Klingeren 
and Ten Ham 1976; ElSohly et al. 1982; Appendino et al. 2008). Cannabinoid acids (precursors of 
the neutral cannabinoids) have been demonstrated to be antibiotic and were employed in veterinary 
medicine in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s (Izzo et al. 2009).
medIcAl ImpoRTAnce of The endocAnnAbInoId sysTem
The ECS is of critical importance to comprehension of the value of medical marijuana. It is of para-
mount importance to human physiology and welfare, regulating numerous life-sustaining functions 
such as memory, perception, feeding behavior, digestion, blood pressure, body temperature, fertility, 
bone density, and disease resistance. The enthusiasm that many medical researchers are currently 
displaying for the significance of the ECS can scarcely be exaggerated. Di Marzo (2008a) stated, 
 

310
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
“Perhaps no other signalling system discovered during the past 15 years is raising as many expecta-
tions for the development of new therapeutic drugs encompassing such a wide range of potential 
strategies for treatments.” Russo (2004b) suggested that endocannabinoid deficiency accounts for 
therapeutic benefits of cannabis in migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and other 
treatment-resistant conditions, a hypothesis supported by Smith and Wagner (2014).
Robson (2014) concluded that “The endocannabinoid system has emerged as an important physi-
ological system and plausible target for new medicines. Its receptors and endogenous ligands play a 
vital modulatory role in diverse functions including immune response, food intake, cognition, emo-
tion, perception, behavioural reinforcement, motor co-ordination, body temperature, wake/sleep 
cycle, bone formation and resorption, and various aspects of hormonal control. In disease it may act 
as part of the physiological response or as a component of the underlying pathology.” McPartland 
et al. (2014) reviewed the literature, confirming that human ECS deficiencies have been implicated 
in schizophrenia, migraine, MS, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), irritable bowel 
syndrome, anorexia, and chronic motion sickness. Pacher et al. (2006) observed that because the 
ECS has indeed been found to be altered in diseases such as MS, spinal cord injury, neuropathic 
pain, cancer, atherosclerosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, hypertension, glaucoma, obesity, and 
osteoporosis, it is appropriate to search for new therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal 
system functionality. Among the new medications anticipated are analgesics, antiallergens, antide-
pressants, antiemetics (preventatives of nausea and vomiting), anti-inflammatories, antineoplastics 
(to inhibit or prevent tumors or malignant cells), appetite modulators, bronchodilators, immunosup-
pressants, muscle relaxants, and neuroleptics (antipsychotic or anesthetic drugs).
Yazulla (2008) wrote, “There is great interest in endocannabinoids for their role in neuroplasticity [the 
capacity of the nervous system to develop new nerve cell connections, allowing the brain to compensate 
for injury and disease and to adjust activities in response to new situations or environmental changes] as 
well as for therapeutic use in numerous conditions, including pain, stroke, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, 
fertility, neurodegenerative diseases, MS, glaucoma and inflammatory diseases, among others.” Pacher 
and Kunos (2013) stated, “the endocannabinoid system holds therapeutic promise for a broad range of 
diseases, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders; obesity/metabolic 
syndrome; cachexia (wasting syndrome); chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; and tissue injury 
and pain, amongst others. However…a better understanding of the pathophysiological role of the endo-
cannabinoid system is required to devise clinically successful treatment strategies.”

“The broad spectrum activity of the endocannabinoid signalling in the central nervous system is…
the main risk in the development of novel therapies based on this system, as it may be difficult to find 
pharmacological approaches for a specific disorder that do not affect other brain processes and pro-
duce important side effects” (Fernández-Ruiz et al. 2014a; cf. Di Marzo 2009). This problem is illus-
trated, as discussed later, by the commercial development of the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant 
for weight control, which had to be discontinued because of unacceptable side effects. “Compared 
to other neuroactive compounds, cannabinoids are exceedingly pleiotropic in their activity, while 
their receptors are part of complex neural webs whose manipulation is difficult to predict in terms of 
in vivo effects. Although the debacle of the CB1 inverse agonist rimonabant well exemplifies these 
difficulties, further investigations in this exciting field are strongly needed” (Appendino et al. 2009).
EVOLUTION OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM 
AND POTENTIAL FOR NONHUMAN PATIENTS
Cannabinoids from cannabis are not only of actual and potential medical value to humans but may be 
useful for veterinary treatment of other animals. Assessment of this possibility requires clarification of the 
evolution of the cannabinoid system among living things. As noted previously, Cannabis cannabinoids 
 

311
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
can influence metabolism without affecting cannabinoid receptors, but in the main, their value is pre-
sumed to be determined by their influence on these receptors. Accordingly, the presence of cannabinoid 
receptors in species determines at least in substantial part the potential value of cannabinoids to them.
Endocannabinoid-like molecules are synthesized in many plants and animals, indicating that the 
ability to manufacture them likely arose very early in evolution, possibly in the common ancestor of 
plants and animals (Elphick and Egertová 2001, 2015). Pacioni et al. (2015) found anandamide in truf-
fles, members of the ascomycete fungal group. However, the capacity to employ such molecules in con-
junction with receptors is restricted to certain groups of species. Insects, the largest group of animals, 
lack endocannabinoid receptors, although some, such as the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and the 
honey bee (Apis mellifera), can synthesize the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG (McPartland et 
al. 2001; Jeffries et al. 2014). Facetiously, it seems, therefore, that insects are unable to become intoxi-
cated by THC (Figure 13.21). Endocannabinoid receptors appear to be confined to a large, advanced 
lineage of animals termed the “deuterostomes” (formally termed Deuterostomia), which includes some 
invertebrates, such as sea squirts and nematodes, and the vertebrates—amphibians, birds, fish, mam-
mals, and snakes (Elphick and Egertová 2001; McPartland 2006; McPartland et al. 2006; Elphick 2012). 
It would seem therefore that all deuterosomes could get high on marijuana (Figure 13.22).
Molecular (nucleic acid) coding for the CB1 and CB2 receptors is thought to have originated 
by an evolutionarily ancient duplication of a common ancestral gene (Cottone et al. 2013). Some 
primitive organisms, including sea squirts (such as Ciona intestinalis), have been found to pos-
sess this presumed ancestral gene, and their ancestry suggests that it evolved about 600 million 
years ago (MYA) (Viveros et al. 2008). Some primitive deuterosomes have just one receptor, 
which is genetically only partly homologous to human receptors. McPartland and Guy (2004b) 
FIGURE 13.21 The hookah-smoking caterpillar from Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland. 
Some have contended that Carroll intended to suggest that the hookah contained cannabis, but this seems very 
unlikely. In any event, as noted in the text, insects lack cannabinoid receptors and are presumed to be unable 
to become intoxicated by smoking cannabis drugs. Drawing by John Tenniel, published in Carroll, L., Alice’s 
Adventures in Wonderland, Macmillan, London, 1865. Colored by Mrwalletpants (CC BY 2.0).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
(cf. McPartland 2004) concluded that (1) endocannabinoids evolved before CB receptors, perhaps 
2000 MYA; (2) they evolved independently multiple times; (3) the primordial CB receptor probably 
evolved about 790 MYA; (4) the CB1–CB2 duplication event occurred either prior to the origin of 
deuterostomes 590 MYA or prior to the divergence of fish and higher vertebrates 400 MYA; and 
(5) the vanilloid receptor may predate CB receptors but its affinity for anandamide is a recent acqui-
sition, evolving after the appearance of mammals 300 MYA. McPartland et al. (2007a) proposed 
that cannabinoid receptors initially coevolved with a fatty acid ester ligand similar to anandamide 
in ancestral metazoans, and affinity for AEA evolved later. McPartland et al. (2007b) found that the 
cannabinoid system evolves conservatively, indicative of its importance for survival.
Gertsch et al. (2010) speculated that dietary contact with phytocannabinoids during mammalian 
evolution may have played a beneficial role in adapting species for survival. McPartland and Guy 
(2004a) extensively examined adaptive and coevolutionary hypotheses between humans and plant 
constituents that affect the human ECS. DiPatrizio and Piomelli (2012) hypothesized that the endo-
cannabinoids play a critical role, in mammals at least, in providing a pleasure response to eating 
sweet and fatty food and thus were evolutionarily critical in accumulation of food energy for survival.
THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM IN RELATION TO THE 
LACK OF OVERDOSE MARIJUANA MORTALITY
ld50 (medIAn leThAl dose)
In toxicology, the “median lethal dose,” LD50 (“lethal dose, 50%”), is the relative amount required 
to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified period. The LD50 is a standard 
measurement of acute toxicity, widely employed to indicate how dangerous (or innocuous) a drug 
or substance is. Clarke and Pate (1994) stated that the LD50 “for orally ingested THC is approxi-
mately 1 g/kg of body weight. Simply interpreted, this means an average sized human would have 
to consume 50–100 g of pure THC to reach the LD50 level. Since high-potency Cannabis contains 
approximately 10% THC, a person would have to eat at least 500–1000 g of this marijuana before 
having a 50% chance of death.” Annas (1997) estimated that the LD50 for marijuana is around 
1:20,000 to 1:40,000, which would require smoking about 680 kg (1500 pounds) in 15 minutes.

TheRApeuTIc Index
The therapeutic index (TI; also called the therapeutic window, safety window, and therapeutic ratio) 
is a comparison of therapeutic to toxic effects (the latter measured by the LD50, described previ-
ously). Clarke and Pate (1994) noted that “even accounting for pyrolytic decomposition and smoke 
loss, there is a several-thousandfold difference between an effective dose of THC and a potentially 
lethal one!” Loewe (1946) compared the ratio at which THC caused psychoactivity in mice to the 
LD50 (i.e., the TI of THC) and determined the TI to be 40,000:1. In comparison, the TI of mor-
phine is 70:1, the TI of ethanol is 10:1, and the TI of digoxin is 2:1. Other common nonprescription 
drugs, such as aspirin, have similar relatively narrow margins of safe use. (Note in the discussion of 
“Dabbing” in Chapter 12 that this innovation facilitates overdosing.)

overdose of marijuana (Gable 2006). “Fatal overdose with cannabis alone has not been reported” 
(Grant et al. 2012). By contrast in the United States, the prescription drug mortality rate is higher 
than the death rate from illicit drugs combined, and drug overdose mortality exceeds mortality 
from motor vehicle accidents (ASTHO 2008). (It should be kept in mind that potentially deadly 
pharmaceuticals frequently are also lifesavers; aspirin kills hundreds in the United States annually, 
but probably saves hundreds of thousands.)
Until recently, the term “opioids” designated synthetic (chemically synthesized) molecules that 
emulate the natural opium alkaloids from the opium poppy plants. Today, the word “opioids” usu-
ally also refers to any of (1) natural narcotic alkaloids (“opiates”) from the opium poppy plant, 
(2) “semisynthetics”—the natural alkaloids that have been chemically transformed (heroin is trans-
formed opium), and (3) chemicals that are entirely synthesized but have similar structures and 
effects to natural opiates.
Opioid drugs (especially prescription analgesics, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and metha-
done) represent a principal cause of drug overdose deaths. In the United States, in 2013, there were 
16,235 deaths involving prescription opioids, as well as 8257 heroin-related deaths, making opioids 
the leading cause of combined legal and illegal drug-induced deaths (Table 13.1). There are numer-
ous opioid receptors in the brainstem, which controls breathing, so opioid drugs have high potential 
to stop respiration. By contrast, although there are cannabinoid receptors in the brainstem, there are 
none in the medullary respiratory centers, contributing to the relative safety of cannabis, at least 
with respect to the possibility of suppression of breathing.
This section should not be misinterpreted to imply that cannabis is necessarily safe, since long-
term recreational consumption has been associated with several hazards (Chapter 12) and medical 
usage also requires cautions (discussed in this chapter). Although it is often said that marijuana has 
never killed anyone, this is not quite true, since simple association with the drug may indirectly be 
fatal. One of the more gruesome illustrations of this is the practice of “body packing” marijuana in 
the colon, recorded several times in Jamaica for the purpose of smuggling. This has led to colonic 
perforation and death (Cawich et al. 2010). However, “There is insufficient evidence…to assess 
whether the all-cause mortality rate is elevated among cannabis users in the general population” 
(Calabria et al. 2010).
CANNABINOIDS AS A POSSIBLE BASIS FOR ELIMINATING 
THE NEED FOR HERBAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA
In criticizing crude marijuana, Bostwick (2012) stated, “Exogenous plant-derived THC is a sledge-
hammer compared with anandamide’s delicate chisel, the former causing marked disruption of 
neuronal signaling and circuit dynamics in the finely tuned endogenous system” and “Recently, 
researchers have stated that the power of new pharmacologic products will obviate the need for 
botanical cannabis.” Certainly, the growing knowledge of how particular cannabinoids (in the 
broadest sense) affect the ECS specifically and the body’s metabolism in general is likely to lead to 
the development of pharmaceuticals precisely keyed to given illnesses. Nevertheless, as noted previ-
ously, the value of medicinal herbal preparations is too readily dismissed by much of the medical 
profession.
MEDICAL CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CANNABIS HAS OR MAY HAVE VALUE
As noted earlier, cannabis (broadly interpreted here as including herbal marijuana, extracted can-
nabinoids, and synthetics) has a very long history of medical applications. Notwithstanding this 
record, at the present time, medical usage of marijuana requires reexamination in the light of present 
medical knowledge. Indeed, although by no means have the possible medical applications of can-
nabis been adequately examined, although a mountain of recent information has been accumulated. 
PubMed (short for Public Medicine) is a massive online guide to publications in biomedical and life 
 

315
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
science publications, the most important comprehensive indexing of the world’s medically signifi-
cant professional literature. In early 2015, a PubMed search for scientific journal articles published 
in the last 20 years containing the word “cannabis” produced almost 9000 articles. Adding the 
word “cannabinoid” increased the number of publications to about 21,000. Over 95% of these deal 
directly or indirectly with medical aspects of cannabis. In recent years, thousands of such publica-
tions have appeared annually. Marijuana affects virtually every organ system of the body (Yazulla 
2008), so it is not surprising that the literature on medicinal aspects of marijuana is extremely 
extensive, indeed rather overwhelming. The medical literature on cannabis expresses a wide range 
of judgments on the relative value and harm of cannabis for various conditions, indicative of the fact 
that there is not yet a medical consensus regarding its values.
As noted by Gordon et al. (2013), “The peer reviewed literature is the most objective means to 
examine purported and realized health effects of marijuana.” The following presentation cites and 
often quotes the conclusions and evaluations of key publications and comprehensive recent reviews 
(frequently meta-analyses, i.e., overviews of previous studies) of the value of cannabis, particularly its 
components, for treating illnesses often claimed to be improved by herbal marijuana or cannabinoids.
Lambert (2007) stated, “Based on the diverse components of the endocannabinoid system and 
taking into account the wide distribution of the molecular targets, a therapeutic endocannabinoid-
based strategy could be useful in numerous and diverse pathological conditions: mood and anxiety 
disorders, movement disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, inflammatory and 
neuropathic pains, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, cancer, atherosclerosis and cardiovascu-
lar diseases, stroke, glaucoma, obesity and metabolic syndrome, addictions (tobacco, alcohol, drug 
of abuse), and osteoporosis are among the most cited in the literature.” Grotenhermen (2003) noted 
that “Properties of cannabis that might be of therapeutic use include analgesia, muscle relaxation, 
immunosuppression, sedation, improvement of mood, stimulation of appetite, antiemesis, lowering 
of intraocular pressure, bronchodilation, neuroprotection and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.”
Ware et al. (2005), based on a survey of about 3000 patients in the United Kingdom, found the 
following frequencies of usage: chronic pain, 25%; MS, 22%; depression, 22%; arthritis, 21%; and 
neuropathy (peripheral nerve problems, often causing weakness, numbness, and pain, usually in 
the hands and feet), 19%. Walsh et al. (2013), on the basis of a survey of 628 Canadians, found that 
patients most commonly reported using cannabis to treat symptoms associated with sleep, pain, and 
anxiety. That is, most patients employ medical marijuana for symptomatic relief of pain and physi-
cal discomfort. (Note that “patients” in such surveys self-identify as such but often self-medicate 
without guidance by medical professionals.)
The Canadian regulations on “access to cannabis for medical purposes,” established by Health 
Canada in July 2001, recognized two categories of patients eligible for medical cannabis. Category 1 
required at least one of the following symptoms: severe pain and/or persistent muscle spasms from 
MS, from a spinal cord injury, from spinal cord disease; severe pain, cachexia, anorexia, weight loss, 
and/or severe nausea from cancer or HIV/AIDS infection; severe pain from severe forms of arthritis; 
or seizures from epilepsy. Category 2 covered debilitating symptom(s) of medical condition(s), other 
than those described in Category 1. In theory, the range of symptoms listed allowed considerable 
latitude for physicians to prescribe cannabis.
AlzheImeR’s dIseAse And oTheR foRms of demenTIA
Dementia refers to pathological decline in mental abilities, including memory, thinking, and social 
skills severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. Walther and Halpern (2010) provided the 
following summary of dementia: “The prevalence rates vary among the different types of dementia. 
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common dementia, accounting for 50%–60% of all cases. Prevalence 
rates increase with age. In Parkinson’s disease the risk for developing dementia is increased six-fold. 
Approximately 30% of stroke survivors develop post-stroke dementia. Far lower prevalence rates 
are documented for Huntington’s disease, which is frequently associated with dementia.”

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a progressive deterioration of cognition and memory 
because of deposition of protein plaques in the brain that apparently interfere with communication 
among brain cells. The disease is correlated with inflammation and death of neurons. No effective 
treatments are available. Fagan and Campbell (2015) noted that “Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a 
complex age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of memory 
and cognitive function. Approximately 36 million people worldwide suffer from AD and, with an 
increasingly aged global population, that number is estimated to triple by 2050. Symptoms of the 
disease include memory loss, difficulty with abstract thinking and completing familiar tasks, confu-
sion, spatial and temporal disorientation, problems with speech, and altered mood. Deterioration in 
the health of patients with AD leads to death within three to nine years.”
Because endocannabinoids are established to be important in brain function, there has been 
interest in exploring the possible therapeutic role of cannabis (Bonnet and Marchalant 2015). 
Eubanks et al. (2006) noted that “THC and its analogues may provide an improved therapeutic 
for Alzheimer’s disease.” Ramírez et al. (2005) found indications that “cannabinoid receptors are 
important in the pathology of AD and that cannabinoids succeed in preventing the neurodegen-
erative process occurring in the disease.” González-Naranjo et al. (2013) observed that because 
Alzheimer’s is multifaceted, cannabis may be advantageous in therapeutically addressing different 
aspects. In this vein, Bedse et al. (2015) stated, “The endocannabinoid (eCB) system appears to be a 
promising therapeutic target as it has the ability to modulate a range of aspects of AD pathology. At 
a first glance, it is striking that cannabinoids like delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), known to 
impair memory, could be beneficial in AD. However, augmentation of eCB signaling could reduce 
excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation and thus could alleviate symptoms of AD.”
Although cannabinoids have been hypothesized to have value for treating brain aging, authorita-
tive confirmation of this has not been obtained (Campbell and Gowran 2007; Krishnan et al. 2009; 
Walther and Halpern 2010). Fernández-Ruiz et al. (2014b) stated, “Based on the potential shown by 
Δ9-THC and CBD in experimental AD, the combination of both phytocannabinoids (i.e., Sativex) 
may be useful for the treatment of AD patients…the only clinical studies performed so far have 
been a small number that used dronabinol, an oil-based solution of synthetic Δ9-THC, which was 
found to ameliorate only some AD-related symptoms.” Similarly, Fagan and Campbell (2015) com-
mented, “targeting this system has become a viable therapeutic approach for AD but further clinical 
studies elucidating the efficacy of cannabinoid treatment are required.”
AmyoTRophIc lATeRAl scleRosIs (lou gehRIg’s dIseAse)
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; also known as motor neuron disease) is an uncommon, pro-
gressive, incurable condition that kills nerve cells in the brain and spinal column, paralyzing and 
ultimately killing the patient. Symptoms include stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and weakness asso-
ciated with muscle wasting, and eventually difficulty speaking, swallowing, and breathing, usually 
resulting in death in three or four years. ALS is the third most common neurodegenerative disorder 
after Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. It occurs in about one person in 400,000 and is 
somewhat more prevalent in males. One form of the disease (familial ALS), responsible for 5%–10% 
of cases, is due to mutation in specific genes, at least 15 of which have been identified. It is suspected 
that numerous factors other than (just) mutative causative genes are involved in the remaining cases.
Carter and Rosen (2001) stated that marijuana should be considered in the pharmacological 
management of ALS because it has properties that may be therapeutic for this disease, includ-
ing analgesia, muscle relaxation, bronchodilation, saliva reduction, appetite stimulation, and sleep 
induction, as well as strong antioxidative and neuroprotective effects, which might prolong neuronal 
cell survival. Weber et al. (2010) noted that “many patients with ALS experience cramps during the 
course of the disease but so far, none of the medications used has been of proven benefit” and in 
an experimental study found that THC did not provide relief for patients. Carter et al. (2010) noted 
that “Based on the currently available scientific data, it is reasonable to think that cannabis might 
 

317
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
significantly slow the progression of ALS, potentially extending life expectancy and substantially 
reducing the overall burden of the disease.” De Lago et al. (2015) stated that “cannabinoid medi-
cines may serve as novel therapy able to delay/arrest neurodegeneration in ALS.” Chiurchiù et al. 
(2015) stated, “there is increasing evidence that cannabinoids and manipulation of the cannabinoid 
system may have therapeutic value in ALS.” Nevertheless, Fernández-Ruiz et al. (2014b) concluded 
that “too few clinical data have yet been generated to allow any firm conclusions to be drawn.”
AnoRexIA And AppeTITe loss
Anorexia refers to loss of appetite (or more technically as loss of desire to eat despite caloric depriva-
tion), which may be due to physical and/or psychological causes. The condition is a side effect of many 
chemotherapy agents and a component of cancer and AIDS pathophysiology. Anorexia nervosa is a 
psychological aversion to eating, often coupled with a distorted self-image and extreme desire to be 
thin, much more common in women as a result of pressures on females to be slim in Western culture. 
The disease is dangerous as it often leads to starvation. Cachexia (also known as wasting syndrome) 
is progressive, involuntary, extreme weight loss associated with chronic wasting disorders. Patients 
suffering from advanced stages of cancer or HIV infection often exhibit progressive weight loss, often 
exacerbated by chronic diarrhea. “Anorexia, early satiety, weight loss and cachexia are prevalent in 
late stage cancer and advanced HIV disease, but there are few effective treatments” (Grant et al. 2012).
“Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-related compounds are involved in food-related 
reward and suggest a dysregulation of their physiology in anorexia nervosa” (Monteleone et al. 
2015). Cannabis has been shown to stimulate appetite, as well as reduce associated nausea and 
vomiting. Dronabinol (synthetic THC) therapy was found to be of some value in treating the condi-
tion (Andries et al. 2014). Cristino and Di Marzo (2014) concluded, “much progress has been made 
in the understanding of the mechanisms through which Δ9-THC affects food intake and energy 
metabolism [but] the application of this knowledge to the development of novel, efficacious and safe 
treatments for cachexia and, particularly, anorexia, has unfortunately lagged behind.”
ARThRITIs And RheumATIsm
Arthritis refers to any of over 100 forms of joint inflammation. The most common type is osteo-
arthritis, a degenerative disease resulting from wear-and-tear damage to cartilage covering bones 
in joints, especially related to the hands, hips, knees, and spine. As with many diseases, should it 
prove that deficiencies in the ECS are partly responsible, supplying cannabinoids might alleviate 
the condition. La Porta et al. (2014) stated, “Currently, the therapeutic approaches for osteoarthritis 
are limited as no drugs are available to control the disease progression and the analgesic treatment 
has restricted efficacy. Increasing evidence from preclinical studies supports the interest of the 
endocannabinoid system as an emerging therapeutic target for osteoarthritis pain… The ubiquitous 
distribution of cannabinoid receptors, together with the physiological role of the endocannabinoid 
system in the regulation of pain, inflammation and even joint function further support the therapeu-
tic interest of cannabinoids for osteoarthritis. However, limited clinical evidence has been provided 
to support this therapeutic use of cannabinoids, despite the promising preclinical data.”
Rheumatism refers to diseases characterized by inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or 
fibrous tissue, especially rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic progressive disease producing inflamma-
tion in the joints and resulting in painful deformity and immobility, especially in the fingers, wrists, 
feet, and ankles. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease—caused by the immune system 
inappropriately attacking the lining of the joints. It affects joints symmetrically—on both sides of 
the body—while osteoarthritis typically affects one side, for example, one knee or hand. The hope 
has been that cannabis, through the ECS, could alleviate the inflammation and pain (via the CB1 
receptors) as well as reduce the counterproductive immune activity (via the CB2 receptors) associ-
ated with rheumatoid arthritis.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Fitzcharles et al. (2014) offered the following comments with respect to the use of herbal can-
nabis for the treatment of rheumatic diseases: “Available drugs generally offer a modest effect 
only… It is therefore understandable that patients will continue to seek other remedies to reduce 
symptoms. Rheumatic disease patients commonly use complementary and alternative medicine, 
and with increasing advocacy for legalization of herbal cannabis as a recreational drug, cannabis 
may be perceived as a safe treatment option… Medical marijuana has…never been recommended 
by any rheumatology group worldwide for symptom relief in rheumatic conditions… To date, there 
is no formal study examining the efficacy or adverse effects of herbal cannabis in rheumatic dis-
eases… Taking all factors into consideration, health care professionals should currently dissuade 
rheumatology patients from using herbal cannabis as a therapy.” Echoing this viewpoint, Kalant 
(2015) commented, “the efficacy and safety of cannabis have not yet been demonstrated in well-
designed clinical trials in patients with chronic rheumatic and arthritic conditions.” Noting that 
“severe arthritis” is the most common reason that Canadians are authorized to possess medicinal 
herbal cannabis, Fitzcharles (2015) commented, “Preclinical animal studies as well as studies of 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis joints provide evidence that the endocannabinoid system is 
locally activated in response to pain stimuli in arthritis, and functions as a pain modulator…it is 
understandable that cannabinoids have a potential for therapeutic relief, thereby calling for more 
scientific study of the effects of herbal cannabis in rheumatic conditions. The scientific research has, 
however, not yet translated into clinical application.”
However, Blake et al. (2006) found that Sativex, described in the preceding discussions, signifi-
cantly alleviated pain from rheumatoid arthritis. “In rheumatoid arthritis a significant reduction in 
disease activity was…noted, which is consistent with pre-clinical work demonstrating that canna-
binoids are anti-inflammatory” (Lynch and Campbell 2011; cf. Lynch and Ware 2015). Dunn et al. 
(2012) commented, “Cannabinoids have been shown to reduce joint damage in animal models of 
arthritis.” Gui et al. (2015) noted, “Increasing evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system, 
especially cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), has an important role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid 
arthritis… In particular, specific activation of CB2 may relieve rheumatoid arthritis.”
bRAIn InjuRy
Traumatic brain injury refers to brain dysfunction caused by an outside force, usually a violent blow 
to the head, but not infrequently caused by an object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet. Mild 
injury may temporarily disrupt brain cells, but serious traumatic brain injury can result in long-term 
complications or death. “Traumatic brain injury (TBI)…affects an estimated 1.7 million people per 
year in North America. TBI patients often contend with persistent challenges including problems 
with learning and memory…studies suggest that the activation of the cannabinoid 1 receptor after a 
traumatic brain injury could be beneficial” (Arain et al. 2015).
“Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents the leading cause of death in young individuals. It trig-
gers the accumulation of harmful mediators, leading to secondary damage, yet protective mecha-
nisms are also set in motion… There is a large body of evidence showing that endocannabinoids 
are markedly increased in response to pathogenic events. This fact, as well as numerous studies on 
experimental models of brain toxicity, neuroinflammation and trauma supports the notion that the 
endocannabinoids are part of the brain’s compensatory or repair mechanisms” (Shohami et al. 2011).
Nguyen et al. (2014) compared the mortality of patients who had suffered severe traumatic head 
(brain) injury in relation to analyses of presence or absence of THC in their urine when admitted 
to hospital. The results bordered on the incredible: patients who had been using marijuana survived 
80% more often than those who had not! This seems to represent a neuroprotective effect related to 
components in marijuana, presumably at least in part related to the role of CB receptors in reduc-
ing inflammation. With respect to brain injury associated with birth, Fernández-López et al. (2013) 
noted, “Numerous experimental studies have proven that the modulation of the endocannabinoid 
system…has beneficial effects during the acute and recovery phases after perinatal brain injury.” 
 

319

Similarly, Arain et al. (2015) commented, “studies provide strong support for the…therapeutic 
potential of modulating cannabinoid signaling to improve outcomes after a TBI.”
cAnceR
Cancer includes a group of diseases characterized by abnormal cell multiplication and consequent 
tissue damage, often accompanied by metastasis—spreading of such activity to other parts of the 
body from the area of origin. Most cancers produce tumors, described as “malignant” in contrast 
to “benign” tumors, which are not metastatic. Noncancerous cells undergo genetically programmed 
cell death (apoptosis), the body’s way of regrowth and renewal. Malignant cells, however, have 
become mutated, escaping the gene control that prevented their continual division and unchecked 
development. Malignant growths are immortal (at least until their host dies or is cured), invading 
surrounding tissues, stimulating the production of blood vessels (angiogenesis) for their sustenance, 
and colonizing distant parts of the body. More than 14 million new cases of cancer and more than 
eight million deaths from cancer are reported annually on a world basis. Breast cancer represents 
about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers annually (Caffarel et al. 2010). Cancers may be caused by 
environmental factors such as chemicals, radiation, and infectious agents or can be the result of 
hereditary mutations. Cancer is the world’s leading cause of death (followed by heart disease and 
stroke) and has the largest economic impact from premature death and disability of all causes of 
death worldwide (John and Ross 2010). The U.S. National Cancer Institute (2015) maintains a web-
site dedicated to information on the use of cannabis in the treatment of cancer.
Almost a fifth of cancer mortality is due to smoking tobacco. However, as discussed earlier, 
claims that smoking marijuana produces cancer have limited validity. Zhang et al. (2015), based 
on a statistical analysis of the pooled data for six case-controlled studies, concluded that there is 
“little evidence for an increased risk of lung cancer among habitual or long-term cannabis smok-
ers, although the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded.” 
Bowles et al. (2012) commented, “Medical cannabis remains a paradox in many ways. Cannabis 
smoke may be carcinogenic but it has been difficult to conclusively link cannabis use and cancer 
development epidemiologically, and cannabinoids have shown some promise as anti-cancer thera-
pies.” Huang et al. (2015) indicated that while smoking has not been statistically linked to lung 
cancer, there may be linkages to other cancers.
Marks et al. (2014) concluded that “The associations of marijuana use with oropharyngeal and 
oral tongue cancer are consistent with both possible pro- and anti-carcinogenic effects of cannabi-
noids. Additional work is needed.”
Massi et al. (2013) wrote: “Over the past years, several lines of evidence support an antitumouri-
genic effect of cannabinoids including Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, synthetic agonists, endocannabi-
noids and endocannabinoid transport or degradation inhibitors… Several cannabinoids have been 
shown to exert anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in various cancer types (lung, glioma, 
thyroid, lymphoma, skin, pancreas, uterus, breast, prostate and colorectal carcinoma) both in vitro 
and in vivo. Moreover, other antitumourigenic mechanisms of cannabinoids are currently emerging, 
showing their ability to interfere with tumour neovascularization, cancer cell migration, adhesion, 
invasion and metastasization.”
Cannabinoids have been demonstrated in laboratory animals and cultures, and in some case 
reports in humans, to inhibit tumor growth or proliferation (Guzmán 2003; Caffarel et al. 2010; 
Guindon and Hohmann 2011; Abrams and Guzman 2014; Velasco et al. 2014; Solinas et al. 2015; 
Zogopoulos 2015), and these anticarcinogenetic effects have been widely and misleadingly employed 
in assertions that “marijuana cures cancer.” Romano and Hazekamp (2013) discussed claims that 
cannabis oil cures cancer. Fowler (2015) examined such claims and the resulting persuasion of 
many that cannabis is currently a validated therapy to reduce or eliminate cancers, permanently 
or for some test period such as five years. He concluded that “the current preclinical data do not 
yet provide robust evidence that systemically administered Δ9-THC will be useful for the curative 
 

320

treatment of cancer. There is more support for an intratumoral route of administration of higher 
doses of Δ9-THC. CBD produces effects in relevant concentrations and models, although more data 
are needed concerning its use in conjunction with other treatment strategies.” Kramer (2015) was 
of a similar viewpoint but nevertheless concluded, “cannabis and cannabinoid pharmaceuticals can 
be helpful for a number of problems, including many affecting patients with cancer.” THC has been 
demonstrated to promote apoptosis in malignant conditions, and “this is obviously a fertile area for 
further research” (Russo 2003a). There is near-unanimous agreement that cannabis has antitumor 
potential and deserves to be examined for the development of anti-cancer therapies (Sarfaraz et al. 
2008). With respect to directly treating tumors of human patients, Cridge and Rosengren (2013) 
commented, “Overall, the cannabinoids may show future promise in the treatment of cancer, but 
there are many significant hurdles to overcome.”
As noted later in the discussion of CBD, this cannabinoid appears to have particular promise for 
treating cancer.
Brain cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, and “gliomas,” which include all tumors aris-
ing from the gluey or supportive tissue of the brain, represent 30% of all brain tumors and 80% of all 
malignant tumors. Torres et al. (2011) found that THC had some effect on controlling cultured malig-
nant gliomas. “Positive effects of cannabinoids in gliomas have attracted tremendous interest for the 
possibility that cannabinoids may serve as a novel form of chemotherapy for patients. However, the 
issue has progressed very slowly in the clinical area” (Fernández-Ruiz et al. 2014a). Foroughi et al. 
(2011) discussed two cases of regression of gliomas, possibly related to consumption of marijuana.
The main cancer-related therapeutic potential of cannabis at present seems to lie in alleviating 
the side effects and symptoms of cancer and its treatments. “The palliative effects of Cannabis 
sativa (marijuana), and its putative main active ingredient, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which 
include appetite stimulation, attenuation of nausea and emesis associated with chemo- or radio-
therapy, pain relief, mood elevation, and relief from insomnia in cancer patients, are well-known” 
(Pacher 2013). “Cannabinoids are well-known to exert palliative effects in cancer patients, and their 
best-established use is in the inhibition of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting” (Velasco 
et al. 2012; cf. Machado Rocha et al. 2008).
On the whole, there is variable but enthusiastic support for the use of cannabis for aspects of 
cancer treatment. “The cannabinoids provide unquestionable advantages compared to current anti-
tumoural therapies” (Bifulco et al. 2006). “Cannabinoids can palliate some cancer symptoms but 
it is unclear how effective they are compared to or combined with conventional therapies, or even 
whether cannabis, purified cannabinoids, or synthetic cannabinoids are more effective” (Bowles et 
al. 2012). “Medicinal cannabis is an invaluable adjunct therapy for pain relief, nausea, anorexia and 
mood modification in cancer patients” (Ruchlemer et al. 2015). “In addition to treatment of nausea 
and anorexia, cannabinoids may be of benefit in the treatment of cancer-related pain, possibly in a 
synergistic fashion with opioid analgesics” (Abrams and Guzman 2014).
cARdIovAsculAR dIseAses
“Heart disease” (understood to include blood vessel disease) is a leading killer of men and women, 
responsible for over 17 million deaths annually throughout the world. Major problems include coro-
nary heart disease (heart attacks), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), raised blood pressure (hyperten-
sion), peripheral artery disease, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, and heart failure.
The ECS and especially CB1 receptors have important influences on heart function and blood 
circulation. “Activation of CB1 receptors in the brain induces cardiovascular stress response, which 
increases heart oxygen consumption and lowers blood flow through coronary arteries” (Fišar 2009a). 
Modulating the functions of the ECS is considered to have therapeutic potential for cardiovascular 
disorders (Cunha et al. 2011). As discussed later in the section on cautions regarding the medical 
uses of cannabis, marijuana consumption is accompanied by a small risk of precipitating adverse 
cardiovascular incidents in susceptible individuals.
 

321
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
Russo (2015) reviewed cardiovascular risks of synthetic and natural cannabinoids and concluded: 
“To date, it appears that ultra-low THC and therapeutic phytocannabinoid dosing are cardioprotec-
tive, while supra-therapeutic recreational doses pose cardiovascular risks, and hyper-CB1 stimula-
tion by potent full agonists is distinctly dangerous to the heart. It remains for society to ascertain 
how science-based education may lower such risks and help potential consumers avoid a perilous 
misadventure in pharmacological roulette.”
Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries characterized by the deposition of plaques of fatty mate-
rial on their inner walls, leading to decreased blood flow. It causes heart attacks, stroke, and periph-
eral vascular disease. “Atherosclerosis and its major acute complications, myocardial infarction and 
stroke, are the leading causes of death and morbidity worldwide… Growing evidence suggests that 
an overactive endocannabinoid-CB1 receptor signaling promotes the development of cardiovascular 
risk factors” (Steffens and Pacher 2015). “The precise role of endocannabinoid system in athero-
sclerosis has not yet been fully recognized…cannabinoids can be linked…to useful effects on car-
diovascular system, e.g., they have protective role in progression of atherosclerosis” (Fišar 2009a).
Hypertension
Hypertension (“high blood pressure”) refers to abnormally high arterial blood pressure. It can dam-
age the arteries, brain (leading to strokes), heart (leading to heart attacks), eyes, kidneys, and other 
organs. “Endogenous cannabinoids have no distinguished function in cardiovascular regulations 
under normal conditions, but they are involved in cardiovascular regulation in hypertension when 
they may hold down elevating of blood pressure through activation of CB1 receptors” (Fišar 2009a).
Ischemia
Ischemia refers to an inadequate blood supply to an organ or part of the body, especially the heart 
muscles. “Increasing of static heartbeat, as far as about 60% during first 30 minutes after smok-
ing cannabis, can be dangerous for men with cardiovascular disorder. Effects of THC on cardio-
vascular system are marked and are mediated largely by CB1 receptors in blood cells and heart… 
Cannabinoids may contribute to cardiovascular collapse connected with myocardial infarction” 
(Fišar 2009a). However, Rajesh et al. (2010) found that CBD has protective cardiac effects. Similarly, 
Waldman et al. (2013), based on a study of mice, found that “a single ultra-low dose of THC before 
ischemia is a safe and effective treatment that reduces myocardial ischemic damage.” With respect 
to stroke, Hillard (2008) commented: “Overall, the available data suggest that inhibition of CB1 
receptor activation together with increased CB2 receptor activation produces beneficial effects” and 
“there is every reason to believe that the ECS contributes in some way to the injury produced by 
ischemia. In light of these facts, the lack of a clear picture of the precise role of this system, is on 
one hand, puzzling. The answer at the moment seems to be that we do not completely appreciate the 
complexity of ECS signaling and that its manipulation using global pharmacological approaches 
has led to incorrect conclusions. Future studies using more selective tools will certainly help to 
clarify this important and fascinating role of the ECS.”
dIAbeTes
Diabetes is a set of diseases in which high blood glucose (blood sugar) develops because insulin 
production is inadequate or because the body does not respond properly to insulin. Insulin is a 
hormone necessary to convert sugar, starch, and other foods into energy. In type 1 (once referred 
to as “juvenile diabetes,” affecting about 10% of diabetics), the pancreas does not produce enough 
insulin; in type 2 (once called “adult-onset diabetes”), the body’s ability to use insulin is defec-
tive. “Most diabetic complications are associated with pathologic alterations in the vascular wall; 
the most common macrovascular complication of diabetes is atherosclerosis, which increases the 
 

322
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease… Diabetic complications have 
tremendous physical, emotional, and economic impact because diabetes is the leading cause of 
kidney failure, nontraumatic lower-limb amputation, and new cases of blindness among adults in 
the United States” (Horváth et al. 2012). Several hundred million people in the world suffer from 
diabetes. Obesity (discussed later) is the leading risk factor for insulin resistance. Poor eating habits 
are resulting in an increase in diabetes worldwide.
Several studies have shown a correlation between cannabis use and insulin levels. Cannabinoid 
receptors are known to occur in the pancreas and to function in regulating glucose and insulin. An 
epidemiological study showed that smoking marijuana is associated with a two-thirds reduction of 
incidence of diabetes (Jancin 2010). Alshaarawy and Anthony (2015) commented. “Recently active 
cannabis smoking and diabetes mellitus are inversely associated… Current evidence is too weak 
for causal inference…on a possibly protective (or spurious) cannabis smoking-diabetes mellitus 
association suggested in prior research.” Frisher et al. (2010) noted, “Herbal cannabis use has been 
linked to harms and benefits for diabetic patients” and “The potential risks and benefits for diabetic 
patients remain unquantified at the present time. Cannabinoids appear to affect biochemical path-
ways associated with diabetes but it is too early to say whether this will lead to new treatments.” Di 
Marzo (2008b) reported that CB1 receptor activation impairs plasma glucose clearance, while CB2 
receptor activation promotes glucose clearance. Penner et al. (2013) observed lower fasting insulin 
levels in cannabis users. Also see the information presented later for CBD and THCV.
epIlepsy
Epilepsy, which affects about 1% of adults and 2% of children (Blair et al. 2015) and 65 million 
people worldwide (Rosenberg et al. 2015), is a serious disorder of the nervous system, caused by 
abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to periodic seizures or convulsions. Dravet syn-
drome is a severe form of childhood epilepsy. Epilepsy is characterized either by mild, episodic 
loss of attention or sleepiness (petit mal) or by severe convulsions with loss of consciousness (grand 
mal). Williams et al. (2014) provide the following information: “Epilepsy is not a single disease, 
but encompasses a diverse family of disorders, all involving an abnormally increased predisposi-
tion to seizures.” While there are dozens of drugs for epilepsy, “approximately 30% of the epileptic 
population experience intractable seizures regardless of antiepileptic drug treatments used.” “Of all 
patients with epilepsy, approximately 50% will ultimately become refractory to drug treatment.” 
“All existing antiepileptic drugs are associated with numerous side effects.”
Friedman and Devinsky (2015) observed, “Patients need new treatments that control seizures 
and have fewer side effects. This treatment gap has led patients and families to seek alternative 
treatments. Cannabis-based treatment for epilepsy has recently received prominent attention in the 
lay press and in social media, with reports of dramatic improvements in seizure control in children 
with severe epilepsy. In response, many states have legalized cannabis for the treatment of epilepsy 
(and other medical conditions) in children and adults.”
“Anecdotal evidence suggests that cannabis might have therapeutic value for epilepsy. In the 
fifteenth century, the epileptic son of a caliphate counsellor in Baghdad was treated with cannabis” 
(Mechoulam 1986). More recently, the use of cannabis in treating epilepsy came to widespread pub-
lic attention when the CNN television network featured the successful treatment of Charlotte Figi, a 
five-year-old girl with epilepsy, with a CBD-rich strain of cannabis called Charlotte’s Web (Maa and 
Figi 2014; Lorentzos and Webster 2015). Her seizures, before treatment occurring every half hour, 
essentially ceased. Note the comments in the following regarding the value of CBD for epilepsy.
Because the ECS inhibits electrical transmission, its potential role in serving to inhibit the unde-
sirable electrical activity accompanying epilepsy seems promising. Hofmann and Frazier (2013) 
argued that the ECS has significant potential as a target for future development of antiepileptic 
therapies, based on three main contentions: “Endocannabinoid mediated systems are intimately 
involved in moment to moment regulation of neuronal excitability throughout many areas of the 
 

323

CNS. Significant aspects of endogenous cannabinoid signaling systems are altered in a wide range 
of epileptic conditions. External modulation of cannabinoid mediated systems can prevent or modu-
late important aspects of epileptiform activity in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo models.”
Blair et al. (2015) stated, “Basic scientific research studies that target different components of 
the brain ECS with specific pharmacological agents have shown great promise toward the devel-
opment of novel therapeutic strategies for the control and possible prevention of epileptic seizure 
disorders.” Di Maio (2013) found evidence based on animal research that the CB1 receptor is a prom-
ising target for research on epilepsy. However, Gloss and Vickrey (2012) and Koppel et al. (2014) 
concluded that cannabis is of unknown efficacy in treating the symptoms of epilepsy. Rosenberg 
et al. (2015) reviewed the literature relating cannabis and epilepsy and stated, “For over a millen-
nium, pre-clinical and clinical evidence have shown that cannabinoids such as CBD can be used to 
reduce seizures effectively, particularly in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. However, many 
questions still remain…regarding the mechanism, safety, and efficacy of cannabinoids in short- and 
long-term use.” Reddy and Golub (2016) commented, “CBD is anticonvulsant, but it has a low affin-
ity for the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors; therefore the exact mechanism by which it affects sei-
zures remains poorly understood. A rigorous clinical evaluation of pharmaceutical CBD products is 
needed to establish the safety and efficacy for the treatment of epilepsy. Identification of mechanisms 
underlying the anticonvulsant efficacy of CBD is additionally critical to identify other potential treat-
ment options.” Tzadok et al. (2016) surveyed 74 children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy, 
who received CBD treatment, and described the effects as “highly promising” but noted that well-
designed clinical trials using enriched CBD are needed. GW Pharmaceuticals is currently testing the 
value of Epidiolex, an experimental cannabis-based product, to treat epilepsy. Also see the comments 
further in this chapter below on the possible anticonvulsant value of CBD for treating epilepsy.
fIbRomyAlgIA
Fibromyalgia is a central nervous system disorder, the second most common rheumatic disorder 
behind osteoarthritis. Fibromyalgia affects 2% of the population of North America, females much 
more commonly than males. It is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and 
heightened sensitivity to pressure in multiple tender points in the neck, spine, shoulders, and hips. 
An associated syndrome of symptoms may include fatigue, insomnia, joint stiffness, and other 
physical problems. There may also be accompanying psychiatric conditions such as depression and 
anxiety. Fibromyalgia does not respond well to conventional pain therapies, and in the past, it was 
often believed that sufferers were merely hypochondriacs whose pain was “in their heads.”
Ste-Marie et al. (2012) found that fibromyalgia patients tended to self-medicate with marijuana. 
Schley et al. (2006) reported that a sample of fibromyalgia patients reported significant benefit from 
cannabis. Skrabek et al. (2008) also reported cannabis provided relief from fibromyalgia. Fiz et al. 
(2011) pointed out, “There is little clinical information on the effectiveness of cannabinoids in the 
amelioration of FM symptoms.” In their own experimental study, Fiz et al. (2011) found that “the 
use of cannabis was associated with beneficial effects on some FM symptoms.” Hendrickson and 
Ferraro (2013) reviewed the relationship of cannabis and fibromyalgia and concluded, “Evidence 
suggests incorporating cannabinoids into an approach including behavioral/lifestyle adaptations 
and cognitive behavioral therapies may optimize overall benefits for many sufferers.”
gAsTRoInTesTInAl dIseAses
As noted in the earlier discussion of the ECS, the body’s endocannabinoids control energy balance 
and metabolism, which includes feeding behavior and digestion. The gut is of course the site of 
energy extraction from food, and its orderly or disordered operation can be expected to be mediated 
by the ECS. Cannabinoid receptors are involved in such functions as secretion of stomach acid and 
digestive enzymes, contraction of the pyloric valve regulating food passage between the stomach 
 

324

and small intestine, moving food through the intestines by gut contractions, detecting visceral pain, 
and regulating appetite and vomiting.
There are numerous debilitating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, including nausea, vomit-
ing, ulcers, irritable bowl, Crohn’s disease, and reflux disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is an 
incurable condition affecting millions in industrialized countries. Irritable bowel syndrome is a 
common disorder characterized by poor bowel function and abdominal discomfort. Crohn’s disease 
is an inflammatory bowel disease usually confined to the lower end of the small intestine. It can lead 
to ulcers, bleeding, and scar formation, which may produce intestinal blockage, cramps, spasms, 
nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and weight, severe diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Paralytic ileus is 
a long-lasting inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, which can produce infection, gas, and a range 
of serious conditions. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a digestive disorder affecting the lower 
esophageal sphincter (the muscle connecting the esophagus to the stomach). When the sphincter is 
weak or relaxes inappropriately, acidic gastric contents flow into the esophagus, damaging it.
Cannabis has a centuries-long history of use for gastrointestinal disorders, including emesis 
(vomiting), gastric ulcers, abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and intestinal inflammation 
(Duncan and Izzo 2014). Di Marzo and Piscitelli (2011) commented, “the endocannabinoid system 
and related emerging signalling system may play a fundamental role in the control of all aspects 
of gastrointestinal physiology and pathology…strategies that either enhance or curb the activity 
of the ECS might be both employed for future therapies targeting various GI disorders.” Todaro 
(2012) stated, “Today, the standard of care for prevention of CINV [chemotherapy-induced nausea 
and vomiting] for highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy is a 5-HT3 receptor antago-
nist, dexamethasone… With the approval of safer and more effective agents, cannabinoids are not 
recommended as first-line treatment for the prevention of CINV and are reserved for patients with 
breakthrough nausea and vomiting.”
Slatkin (2007) wrote, “Improvement in antiemetic therapy across the entire spectrum of 
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting will involve the use of agents with different mecha-
nisms of action in concurrent or sequential combinations, and the best such combinations should 
be identified. In this effort, the utility of the cannabinoids should not be overlooked.” Anecdotal 
and scientific evidence suggest that cannabis use may have a positive impact in patients suffering 
from inflammatory bowel disease (Borrelli et al. 2013). CB1 receptors in the brain and in the gut 
regulate gut motility, and both receptor types attenuate gut inflammation, and these considerations 
may explain the therapeutic role of cannabis in gastrointestinal disorders (Duncan and Izzo 2014). 
Di Carlo and Izzo (2003) observed that cannabis has potential “for the treatment of a number of 
gastrointestinal diseases, including nausea and vomiting, gastric ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, 
Crohn’s disease, secretory diarrhoea, paralytic ileus and gastroesophageal reflux disease.” There is 
some clinical evidence that cannabis is therapeutic for Crohn’s disease (Naftali et al. 2011, 2013, 
2014; Schicho and Storr 2014). At least in experimental animals, THC has been shows to reduce 
esophageal sphincter relaxation and decrease acid production, both of which may benefit gastro-
esophageal reflux disease (Caraceni et al. 2014).
Cannabis has proven useful in controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (Duran 
et al. 2010; Parker et al. 2011; Bowles et al. 2012; Borgelt et al. 2013; Rock et al. 2014), although long-
term use can produce “cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome” (Nicolson et al. 2012). Cannabinoid 
hyperemesis (a term coined in 2004) has been described as a rare effect of chronic marijuana use 
characterized by severe, cyclic nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and (very oddly) marked by 
compulsive hot-water bathing for temporary symptom relief (Allen et al. 2004; Venkatesan et al. 
2004; Wallace et al. 2011; Simonetto et al. 2012).
glAucomA
Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, which is essential for good vision. 
Glaucoma is generally an age-related chronic eye condition causing progressive loss of peripheral 
 

325
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
vision. The damage is often caused by increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which can lead to blind-
ness if not treated. Indeed, glaucoma is the world’s leading cause of irreversible blindness.
It is well known that smoking marijuana can affect vision and may be useful for treating sev-
eral degenerative and inflammatory retinal diseases (Xu and Azuaro-Blanco 2014). Marijuana can 
produce “red eye” (“conjunctival vasodilation” or “corneal vasodilation”; Figure 12.2) (Yazulla 
2008). Anecdotal reports in the early 1990s indicated that Jamaican fishermen smoked marijuana to 
improve their vision for fishing at night. In fact, there is some evidence that marijuana enhances dim 
light vision (Russo et al. 2004). In the Caribbean area, Canasol, an alcoholic extract of C. sativa, is 
used to treat glaucoma. Canasol originated from research at the University of the West Indies and 
in private ophthalmic clinics (West 1997).
Several of the cannabinoids can reduce IOP and therefore may have utility in treating glau-
coma. Some noncannabinoid components of Cannabis also may have this capacity. Nucci et al. 
(2008) stated, “The identification of plant-derived, endogenous, or synthetic CBs capable of inter-
acting with the intraocular endocannabinoid system could open new perspectives for the treatment 
of glaucoma.” Tomida et al. (2004) wrote, “Cannabinoids have the potential of becoming a useful 
treatment for glaucoma, as they seem to have neuroprotective properties and effectively reduce 
intraocular pressure. However, several challenges need to be overcome, including the problems 
associated with unwanted systemic side effects (psychotropic, reduction in systemic blood pres-
sure), possible tolerance, and the difficulty in formulating a stable and effective topical preparation.” 
The same information was given by Xu and Azuaro-Blanco (2014). Samudre et al. (2014), based 
on studies of rats, stated, “Topically applied cannabinoids are effective agents that reduce IOP and 
confer neuroprotection and are prime candidates for potential glaucoma treatment.”
The American Glaucoma Society issued the following position statement (Jampel 2010): 
“Although marijuana can lower the IOP, its side effects and short duration of action, coupled with 
a lack of evidence that its use alters the course of glaucoma, preclude recommending this drug in 
any form for the treatment of glaucoma at the present time.” Buys and Rafuse (2010), on behalf of 
the Canadian Ophthalmological Society, were equally critical. Sun et al. (2015) stated, “Currently, 
the deleterious effects of marijuana outweigh the benefits of its IOP-lowering capacity in most glau-
coma patients. Under extremely rare circumstances, a few categories of glaucoma patients may be 
potential candidates for treatment with medical marijuana.”
heAdAche
Cannabis is “used by patients for relief of headache generally without physician recommendation. 
There is much anecdotal support and experimental evidence for this use but no good clinical trials 
for headache” (McGeeney 2013). “The literature suggests that the medicinal use of cannabis may 
have a therapeutic role for a multitude of diseases, particularly chronic pain disorders including 
headache. Supporting literature suggests a role for medicinal cannabis and cannabinoids in several 
types of headache disorders including migraine and cluster headache” (Baron 2015).
Migraine
Migraine refers to recurrent moderate to severe headaches associated with other symptoms. The 
headache typically affects half of the head, pulsates, and can last three days. Additional symptoms 
may include nausea; vomiting; sensitivity to light, sound, or smell; and an “aura” (a visual or other 
kind of sensory premonition of headache, occurring in about 10% of patients). The pain is generally 
increased by physical activity. Before puberty, boys are more affected than girls, but afterward, two 
to three times more women suffer migraines than men.
More than a century ago, Sir William Osler, perhaps the finest physician of his era, recom-
mended cannabis as the “most satisfactory remedy for migraine” (Osler and McCrae 1915). Today, 
there is appreciable support for the thesis that cannabis can be therapeutic for migraine (Russo 1998, 
2001, 2004b; McGeeney 2013). Greco and Tassorelli (2015) concluded, “Migraine has numerous 
 

326
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
relationships with endocannabinoids, and a deficiency in the endocannabinoid system has been 
hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of migraine. However biochemical studies providing 
a scientific basis for the potential efficacy of (endo)cannabinoids in migraine are, so far, limited.”
hIv And AIds
HIV originated in west-central Africa during the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. HIV 
infection degrades the immune system, increasing susceptibility to diseases. The severe stages are 
referred to as AIDS and are often accompanied by extreme weight loss, pneumonia, and Kaposi’s 
sarcoma, a type of cancer. If untreated, death is common within 10 years. A cure has not yet been 
formulated, but antiretroviral treatment can substantially suspend the condition.
HIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. 
(Werner 2001 discussed the difficulties of advocating marijuana to alleviate the effects of AIDS, 
since both were the subjects of prejudice.) The disease also has significant economic impact.
Patients with these conditions are one of the largest groups using cannabis for medicinal pur-
poses. “Reasons for smoking cannabis cited by patients include countering the nausea, anorexia, 
stomach upset, and anxiety associated with the disease and with antiretroviral therapy” (Hazekamp 
and Grotenhermen 2010). Various studies reviewed by Hazekamp and Grotenhermen (2010) indi-
cate that cannabis is useful for stimulating appetite and relieving pain in HIV/AIDS patients. Lutge 
et al. (2013) stated, “The use of cannabis (marijuana), its active ingredient or synthetic forms such 
as dronabinol has been advocated in patients with HIV/AIDS, in order to improve the appetite, 
promote weight gain and lift mood. Dronabinol has been registered for the treatment of AIDS-
associated anorexia in some countries. However, the evidence for positive effects in patients with 
HIV/AIDS is limited, and some of that which exists may be subject to the effects of bias.” Ellis et 
al. (2009) stated, “Neuropathic pain in HIV is an important and persisting clinical problem, affect-
ing 30% or more of HIV-infected individuals. Although combination antiretroviral therapy has 
improved immunity and survival in HIV, it does not significantly benefit neuropathic pain… Our 
findings suggest that cannabinoid therapy may be an effective option for pain relief in patients with 
medically intractable pain due to HIV.”
hunTIngTon’s dIseAse
Huntington’s disease (Huntington disease) is an inherited chronic condition in which nerve cells 
in the brain break down over time, deteriorating muscle coordination and mental capacities and 
leading to behavioral symptoms. Huntington’s disease was once called Huntington’s chorea, as cho-
rea (involuntary movement) usually develops. The condition affects about 1 in 10,000 individuals, 
symptoms typically beginning in middle age (Casteels et al. 2015).
Regarding therapy with cannabis, Armstrong and Miyasaki (2012) wrote that “information is 
insufficient to recommend long-term use, particularly given abuse potential concerns.” Similarly, 
Kluger et al. (2015) also found that “data are insufficient to draw conclusions regarding Huntington’s 
disease.” A clinical trial with Sativex failed to slow disease progression (Fernández-Ruiz et al. 
2014b). Koppel et al. (2014) concluded that cannabis is of unknown efficacy in treating the symptoms 
of Huntington disease. Pietropaolo et al. (2015), based on mice studies, suggested that “prolonged 
administration of cannabinoid receptor agonists could be an appropriate strategy for selectively 
improving motor symptoms and stimulating neuroprotective processes in HD patients.”
InsomnIA
Insomnia is “characterized by a night complaint of an insufficient amount of sleep or not feeling 
rested after the habitual sleep episode. Insomnia is often associated with feelings of restlessness, 
irritability, anxiety, daytime fatigue and tiredness” (Murillo-Rodríguez et al. 2014). “Fifty-eight 
 

327
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
percent of adult Americans have reported symptoms of insomnia a few nights a week or more. The 
staggering prevalence of insomnia and the well-known complications of poor sleep quality, such as 
its effect on productivity, mental health, and cardiac and endocrinologic function, suggest the need 
for effective treatment of this spectrum of disorders” (Tringale and Jensen 2011).
Cannabis has historically been employed to treat sleep difficulties, and because it has sedative 
and anxiety-reducing properties (Nicholson et al. 2004; Bergamaschi et al. 2011), there is reason to 
believe that it has potential to treat insomnia. THC has sleep-inducing properties, while low-dose 
CBD can be alerting or neutral and high-dose CBD is sleep-inducing (Russo et al. 2009). CBD may 
also reduce symptoms that interfere with sleep. As noted in Chapter 9, dealing with essential oil, 
some of the volatile terpenes present may also play a role in inducing sleep. The pain-relieving prop-
erties of cannabis may also assist in promotion of sleep for some patients. Ware et al. (2010a) found 
that nabilone was effective in improving sleep in patients with fibromyalgia. Tringale and Jensen 
(2011) noted, “a significant decrease in reported time to of sleep after the use of marijuana in both 
those with and those without reported sleep difficulties” and that their “result is supported by recent 
findings concerning the endocannabinoid system, as well as voluminous anecdotal evidence.” Patel 
et al. (2014) pointed out that THC increases melatonin production (melatonin is synthesized in the 
pineal gland at night, and contributes to sleep), and “could contribute to the well-known crash, or 
sleepiness, experienced after a bout of cannabis use.”
lIveR dIseAse
Numerous maladies affect the liver, particularly cirrhosis or scarring, which compromise the liver’s 
ability to remove toxins from the blood. Excessive alcohol consumption, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease, and hepatitis B and C are chief causes. More than 1.5 million die of liver diseases annually 
worldwide.
CB1 receptors are common in the normal liver, and CB2 receptors develop in the cirrhotic liver. 
Parfieniuk and Flisiak (2008) commented, “controlling CB1 or CB2 signalling appears to be an 
attractive target in managing liver diseases… Unquestionably, influencing endocannabinoid signal-
ing may have a beneficial effect on delaying or even reversing hepatic fibrosis.” The same viewpoint 
was expressed by Izzo and Camilleri (2008). Similarly, Mallat et al. (2011) observed that “Recent 
findings have revealed a role of endocannabinoids and their receptors in the pathogenesis of several 
key steps of acute and chronic liver injury, therefore identifying pharmacological modulation of 
cannabinoid receptors as an attractive strategy for the management of morbidity related to liver 
injury.” As noted later in this chapter, there is evidence that CBD may be therapeutic for alcohol-
induced liver damage.
moRnIng sIckness
“Morning sickness,” despite its name, affects pregnant women at any time of day or night. This 
condition is experienced by 50%–90% of pregnant women, usually early in pregnancy. It is charac-
terized by nausea and/or vomiting and heightened sensitivity to smells and flavors. Rarely (1%–2% 
occurrence), a life-threatening form of vomiting referred to as hyperemesis gravidarum (hypereme-
sis syndrome, described previously) requires hospitalization. As noted in the section on gastrointes-
tinal diseases, cannabis is effective against nausea and vomiting.
Cannabis has been employed historically to treat morning sickness, a use that persists among 
Rastafarian women in Jamaica (Westfall et al. 2006). Westfall et al. (2006) surveyed women who 
had employed cannabis for morning sickness and found that 92% considered it effective. However, 
as discussed in the section on cautions regarding medical marijuana, there is concern that cannabis 
might have effects on the fetus (although, as discussed by Russo 2002, cannabis has been employed 
extensively in historical times to treat female reproductive issues). The health implications of pre-
natal exposure to cannabis remain unclear. “Although it is the most widely used recreational drug 
 

328

in pregnancy…conclusive evidence is lacking with regards to immediate health effects of prena-
tal cannabis exposure, such as infant birthweight and rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity. 
In some studies, maternal cannabis use appears, at face value, to be associated with lower birth 
weight and higher rates of premature delivery; in others, birth outcomes are comparable to those 
of non-exposed infants” (Westfall et al. 2006). Hill and Reed (2013) examined evidence regarding 
the effects of marijuana exposure during pregnancy and breast-feeding and concluded that “The 
current evidence suggests subtle effects of heavy marijuana use on developmental outcomes of 
children. However, these effects are not sufficient to warrant concerns above those associated with 
tobacco use.” Metz and Stickrath (2015) stated, “Further research is needed to provide evidence-
based counselling of women regarding the anticipated outcomes of marijuana use in pregnancy. 
In the meantime, women should be advised not to use marijuana in pregnancy or while lactating.”
mulTIple scleRosIs And spAsTIcITy
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by spasticity (uncomfortable 
and distressing muscle spasms and limb stiffness), painful muscle cramps and stiffness, reduced 
mobility, chronic pain in the arms and legs, tingling or pricking of the fingers and toes, ataxia 
(inability to control muscle movements), tremors, and intestinal and urination problems. “Multiple 
sclerosis (MS) is the commonest physically disabling neurological condition in young adults, with 
a prevalence between 50 and 200 per 100,000, depending on ethnic and geographical factors” 
(Novotna et al. 2011). MS is commonest in northern Europe and in regions colonized by white 
northern Europeans such as North America and is more frequent in females (Pryce and Baker 2014).
The axon (extension of a nerve cell that carries messages) is wrapped in a layer of myelin, which, 
like the coating around an electrical wire, insulates and promotes nerve transmission. MS produces 
inflammation that degrades myelin in the central nervous system neurons, as well as other features 
of the nerve cells. MS is generally believed to be an autoimmune condition. It is thought that can-
nabinoids may be therapeutically effective in treating MS because they are immunomodulatory.
In a survey of patient perceptions of the value of marijuana for treating MS, Page and Verhoef 
(2006) noted, “The perceived benefits of use were consistent with previous reports in the literature: 
reduction in pain, spasms, tremors, nausea, numbness, sleep problems, bladder and bowel prob-
lems, and fatigue and improved mood, ability to eat and drink, ability to write, and sexual func-
tioning. Adverse effects included problems with cognition, balance, and fatigue and the feeling of 
being high. Although participants described risks associated with using marijuana, the benefits they 
derived made the risks acceptable.”
There is considerable support for the use of cannabis to treat MS, and forms of it have been 
authorized for treatment of MS in numerous countries. “Cannabinoids…are effective in treating 
neuropathic pain in MS” (Iskedjian et al. 2007). “In clinical trials, more patients have been treated 
with cannabinoids for MS then for any other indication” and “MS is one of the few conditions where 
long-term extension studies have been performed with cannabis-based medicines” (Hazekamp and 
Grotenhermen 2010). “Undoubtedly, the most promising clinical use of cannabinoids concerns MS” 
(Chiurchiù et al. 2015).
Spasticity (and sometimes tremors) accompanies spinal cord injury as well as MS. There are 
indications that cannabis can indeed improve the symptoms of both MS and spinal cord suffer-
ers (Hazekamp and Grotenhermen 2010). “MS results from disease that impairs neurotransmis-
sion and this is controlled by cannabinoid receptors and endogenous cannabinoid ligands. This can 
limit spasticity and may also influence the processes that drive the accumulation of progressive 
disability” (Baker et al. 2012). “An increasing amount of evidence is now emerging to confirm 
anecdotal reports of symptomatic improvement, particularly for muscle stiffness and spasms, neu-
ropathic pain and sleep and bladder disturbance, in patients with MS treated with cannabinoids” 
(Zajicek and Apostu 2011). “We found evidence that combined THC and CBD extracts may provide 
therapeutic benefit for MS spasticity symptoms” (Lakhan and Rowland 2009). “Data from animal 
 

329
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
models of MS and clinical studies have supported the anecdotal data that cannabis can improve 
symptoms such as limb spasticity, which are commonly associated with progressive MS” (Pryce 
and Baker 2012). Corey-Bloom et al. (2012) “saw a beneficial effect of inhaled cannabis on spas-
ticity among patients receiving insufficient relief from traditional treatments. Although generally 
well-tolerated, smoking cannabis had acute cognitive effects.” Oreja-Guevara (2012) found that 
cannabis has “shown a clear-cut efficacy to reduce spasticity and their associated symptoms in those 
patients refractory to other therapies, with a good tolerability/safety profile.” Koppel et al. (2014) 
reported that cannabis is “probably effective” in treating spasticity. Kluger et al. (2015) concluded 
that cannabis likely has no benefit for tremor in MS. The THC/CBD oromucosal spray Sativex 
(nabiximols) has been extensively employed to treat MS. “Real-life data confirm nabiximols as an 
effective and well-tolerated treatment option for resistant multiple sclerosis spasticity in clinical 
practice” (Flachenecker et al. 2014). Centonze et al. (2009) found that some parameters measuring 
the severity of MS were not altered by Sativex.
neuRodegeneRATIve dIseAses
Neurodegenerative diseases are incurable, debilitating conditions caused by progressive death or 
degeneration of neurons of the nervous system. This produces ataxias (problems with movement 
or motor functions) and dementias (decline in cognitive or mental functioning). “The treatment of 
neurodegenerative disorders is possibly one of the major challenges for biomedical research in the 
present century in developed countries, given the present and future increases in expected longevity 
in these countries, which will give greater opportunity for these disorders to appear” (Fernández-
Ruiz et al. 2014a). Inflammation appears to be a common denominator among diverse neurodegen-
erative diseases.
Scotter et al. (2010) noted, “There has been anecdotal and preliminary scientific evidence of can-
nabis affording symptomatic relief in diverse neurodegenerative disorders. These include multiple 
sclerosis, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.” 
The neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of the cannabinoids (particularly of CBD) 
“may represent a very promising agent with the highest prospect for therapeutic use” (Iuvone et 
al. 2009). Rosales-Corral et al. (2015) noted, “Research on cannabinoids has been growing signifi-
cantly in the last five years. More than fifty percent of this research corresponds to ‘cannabinoids 
and brain,’ particularly about neurodegeneration.”
The American Academy of Neurology sponsored a review of all studies of medical marijuana 
published from 1948 through 2013 for evidence of efficacy in treating symptoms of MS, Huntington’s 
disease, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, cervical dystonia (a rare painful condition characterized by 
involuntary contraction of the muscles of the neck and shoulder, causing twisting and tilting of the 
head), and Tourette’s syndrome. The review concluded that cannabis appears to help alleviate spas-
ticity and central or spasm-related pain and some other MS symptoms, but there is little evidence 
of efficacy in treating epilepsy or movement disorders, and there are serious concerns about side 
effects (Koppel et al. 2014; Kurt 2014).
Inflammatory responses in the brain have become a central area of research to address numer-
ous degenerative diseases of the brain (De Ceballos 2015). Chiurchiù et al. (2015) reviewed the 
mechanisms of brain functions in relation to how cannabis might be used therapeutically to address 
neuroinflammatory diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis. Different classes of cells are involved in the protective inflammatory response by the 
nervous system and in the remainder of the body. Outside of the nervous system, most of the body’s 
protective cells that combat invading pathogens and eliminate damaged cells are macrophages and 
lymphocytes, which arise in the blood system. However, particularly important to the protection of 
the central nervous system are “microglial cells,” colorfully described by Chiurchiù et al. (2015) 
as protective soldiers, defending the brain in particular from infection, tumors, ischemia, trauma, 
and neurodegeneration. These are thought to remain dormant in the healthy brain but (like blood 
 

330

immune cells) become activated in response to damage or infection. Microglial cells normally 
appear to lack CB receptors, but when the nervous system experiences local inflammation, they 
develop high levels of CB2 receptors, suggestive of a critical role in neuroinflammatory conditions. 
It is not surprising that CB2 receptors are localized in protective brain cells, since outside the ner-
vous system, they are widely present in immune system cells.
Zogopoulos et al. (2015) summarized the current status of therapeutic possibilities as follows: 
“Over the last years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the role of endocannab-
inoids in preventing or reducing the effects of progressive neurodegenerative diseases. The ECS has 
been shown to mediate neuroprotection in many neurological and psychiatric disorders including 
pain, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s 
chorea, MS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and epilepsy. It also has neurotrophic and neuroprotec-
tive effects in cerebral ischemia (stroke) and traumatic brain injury. The endocannabinoid system 
represents a local messenger between the nervous and immune system and is obviously involved in 
the control of immune activation and neuroprotection. Manipulation of endocannabinoids and/or 
use of exogenous cannabinoids in vivo can constitute a potent treatment modality against inflam-
matory disorders.”
See the sections in this chapter regarding the value of cannabis for each of Alzheimer’s disease, 
Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome, and brain injury.
neuRopAThy
“Peripheral neuropathy” (usually implied when the word neuropathy is used) refers to impaired sen-
sation, movement, or body functions caused by damage or diseases affecting nerves. Carpal tunnel 
syndrome is a familiar example. “Chronic neuropathic pain affects 1%–2% of the adult population 
and is often refractory to standard pharmacologic treatment” (Ware et al. 2010b). “Painful periph-
eral neuropathy comprises multiple symptoms that can severely erode quality of life. These include 
allodynia (pain evoked by light stimuli that are not normally pain-evoking) and various abnormal 
sensations termed dysesthesias (e.g., electric shock sensations, ‘pins and needles,’ sensations of 
coldness or heat, numbness, and other types of uncomfortable and painful sensations). Common 
causes of peripheral neuropathy include diabetes, HIV/AIDS, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclero-
sis, and certain drugs and toxins. Commonly prescribed treatments come from drugs of the tricyclic 
and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant classes, anticonvulsants, opioids, 
and certain topical agents. Many patients receive only partial benefit from such treatments, and 
some either do not benefit or cannot tolerate these medications” (Grant 2013).
As noted under the section titled “Pain,” cannabis appears helpful for pain relief accompanying 
various diseases. “The analgesic effects of herbal cannabis, derived from the dried leaves and flow-
ers, have been most studied in neuropathic pain conditions” (Fitzcharles et al. 2014). “Cannabinoids 
show promise for treatment of neuropathic pain in humans either alone or as an add-on to other 
therapeutic agents” (Rahn and Hohmann 2009). Wilsey et al. (2013) concluded that “vaporized 
cannabis, even at low doses, may present an effective option for patients with treatment-resistant 
neuropathic pain.” Grant (2013) stated, “data suggest, on balance, that cannabis may represent a 
reasonable alternative or adjunct to treatment of patients with serious painful peripheral neuropathy 
for whom other remedies have not provided fully satisfactory results.” Gutierrez and Hohmann 
(2011) concluded: “Cannabinoids effectively suppress neuropathic pain in preclinical and clinical 
studies. The challenge is to balance analgesic efficacy with the presence of adverse side effects 
(i.e., dizziness or sedation)…. In clinical settings, cannabinoid-based medications show therapeutic 
efficacy, and side effects are tolerable or no worse than those of conventional neuropathic pain med-
ications (e.g., gabapentanoids, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants). Thus, cannabinoids 
show promise for managing neuropathic pain that is intractable to conventional treatments or as an 
adjunct to existing medications. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness 
and safety of these compounds in humans.”

obesITy
Obesity is the result of addictive behavior but has become so normalized that it doubtfully qualifies 
as a psychiatric condition. However, in 2015, the American Medical Association voted to classify 
obesity as a disease, albeit not specifically psychiatric in nature. The world is experiencing a fat epi-
demic: 1.2 billion are overweight and an additional 475 million are obese (World Obesity Federation 
2015). Although imperfect as an indicator of degree of overweight status, body mass index (BMI), 
a measure of relative weight to height, is widely used. BMI = weight in kg divided by height in m2. 
“Overweight” or preobesity is defined as a BMI of 25–29.9 kg/m2, while “obesity” is defined as 
a BMI >30 kg/m2. In the Western world, half of people are overweight, one in six is obese. Over 
200 million school-age children are overweight, causing the present generation to have a shorter 
predicted lifespan than their parents. Obesity is more common globally that undernutrition and is 
one of the most important public health issues. Excess body weight in the form of accumulated fat 
can severely impair health. Many major chronic illnesses characterize modern industrialized soci-
eties, notably heart disease, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, some kinds of cancer, and dental 
caries, and overeating is substantially responsible.
The ECS is an important regulator of eating. It is well known that marijuana stimulates the 
appetite, an effect caused by stimulation of the CB1 receptors in hypothalamic feeding circuits in 
the brain (Williams et al. 2015). “Obesity seems to be a condition associated with a pathological 
overactivation of the endocannabinoid system” (Viveros et al. 2008). Accordingly, suppressing the 
receptor responsible for overeating would be expected to reduce appetite. Indeed, Trillou et al. 
(2004) found that knockout (genetically engineered) mice in which the CB1 receptors were inacti-
vated were quite resistant to obesity (Figure 13.23) and had notably improved energy metabolism, 
less tendency for fat deposition, and improved insulin levels. As noted earlier, the synthetic cannabi-
noid rimonabant, a CB1 cannabinoid receptor suppressor, was licensed for a period as a weight-loss 
pharmaceutical for humans. It was sold in over 50 countries but was discontinued because of side 
effects such as suicidal thoughts and acute depression and was withdrawn from the legal market in 
2009. The problem is that CB1 receptors control many metabolic functions, and suppressing them 
to therapeutically control one function can negatively affect other vital activities. Illustrative of how 
deleterious suppression of the CB1 receptors can be is the observation that feeding rimonabant to 
newborn mice results in their cessation of suckling and starving to death (Fride 2004).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
In the experiment of Trillou et al. (2004) referred to previously, feeding efficiency of the mice lack-
ing normal CB1 receptors was lower (i.e., the mice extracted less energy from the same amount of food 
by comparison with normal mice), which would not be adaptive in the wilderness but is desirable for 
weight control. In nature, food is almost always in short supply most of the time, and evolution has 
favored metabolic systems that efficiently extract energy from food, maximizing storage of fat in the 
body’s fat cells in order to survive periods of famine. The ECS is one of nature’s ways of promoting 
food energy storage in a world where the supply of food is erratic and limited. Food is so abundant 
today that the ECS is not designed to limit its consumption (facetiously, it can be blamed for obesity).
Curiously, although cannabis stimulates the appetite, cannabis use is negatively correlated with 
obesity. Le Strat and Le Foll (2011) found that obesity is a third lower in regular marijuana smokers 
compared to abstainers. Penner et al. (2013) observed that cannabis users have smaller waist cir-
cumference (as well as higher levels of high-density lipoprotein, the desirable kind of cholesterol). 
The explanation for the net appetite-suppressing effect of cannabis may lie in the activation of not 
just CB1 receptors but also of other appetite-regulating systems by components of marijuana.
osTeopoRosIs
Bone is a specialized tissue that continuously undergoes renewal and repair known as “bone remod-
eling.” Specialized cells called osteoblasts generate new bone, while other specialized cells called 
osteoclasts dispose of old bone. Imbalance in bone formation and bone resorption is the main cause of 
bone disorders. Osteoporosis is characterized by gradual deterioration of bone mass, increased bone 
fragility, and increased risk of fracture. In developed nations, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of 
females are affected. Several other skeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis are also character-
ized by bone deterioration. Bone fractures represent one of the main causes of death among elderly 
patients, and given the aging populations in industrialized countries, the disease is of increasing con-
cern. Osteoporosis is often caused by estrogen deficiency (in postmenopausal women) and glucocorti-
coid treatment (glucocorticoids are widely used for chronic treatment of such conditions as bronchial 
asthma and skin diseases). Women in Western countries are more likely to die of a hip fracture than of 
breast cancer. Men suffering from prostate disease may experience associated bone problems.
Endocannabinoids, receptors (both CB1 and CB2), and their metabolizing enzymes are present 
in the skeleton and are the subject of ongoing research (Idris et al. 2009; Bab and Ofek 2011; Rossi 
et al. 2011; Bab 2012). CB2 receptors are expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts; they stimulate 
bone formation and inhibit bone resorption (Bab et al. 2009). “There is a steadily growing body of 
evidence suggesting that the skeletal endocannabinoid system plays an important role in the regu-
lation of bone mass in health and in disease… Future studies should…greatly enhance our under-
standing of the role of the skeletal endocannabinoid system in bone pathologies and encourage the 
development of cannabinoid-based therapy aimed at providing both anti-resorptive and anabolic 
effects in bone” (Idris 2010). An unanswered question is whether recreational use of marijuana is 
correlated with effects on the skeleton (Idris and Ralson 2010).
Aside from bone fractures due to osteoporosis, fractures in general are extremely common inju-
ries. Kogan et al. (2015), in an experiment on fracture healing in rats, reported that “Many fractures 
heal by a process known as endochondral ossification. In this process initial bridging across the 
fracture gap is made by a cartilaginous callus that mineralizes, and is subsequently resorbed and 
replaced by a bony callus. The bony callus is further remodelled to form mature bone that is similar 
to the prefracture tissue…our results suggest that the CBD-induced stimulation of fracture healing 
occurs during the later phases of healing (after six weeks).”
pAIn
Pain is the most common symptom of illness and indeed constitutes an illness. Pain may be chronic 
(long-lasting, usually at least months) or acute (beginning suddenly, often from an injury and 
 

333
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
typically relieved when the injury heals or is treated). Analgesia—relief from pain—is the most fre-
quent reason people seek medical treatment. Notcutt (2004) stated, “Chronic pain affects approxi-
mately 1 person in 12. For those who are over the age of 65 the incidence rises beyond 1 in 4. All 
the current analgesics have their problems… Sadly, having tried all the therapeutic options, many 
patients are left to continue their lives with inadequate or minimal control of pain.”
There is a close relationship between pain signaling and the CB receptors (Woodhams et al. 
2015). CB1 receptors occur in the central and peripheral nervous systems concerned with pain. 
Inflammation produces considerable pain, and CB2 receptors, which occur especially in immune 
system cells, seem to be particularly involved with inflammatory-related pain. Acetaminophen is 
the most popular drug for relief of pain and fever. It is known to produce analgesia through the CB1 
receptors (Mallet et al. 2008).
“‘Severe [chronic] pain’ is the most common reason for medicinal herbal cannabis use, with arthri-
tis and musculoskeletal pain cited as the most prevalent specific medical condition” (Fitzcharles et 
al. 2014). Hazekamp and Grotenhermen (2010), Aggarwal (2013), and Russo and Hohmann (2013) 
reviewed studies reporting that cannabis relieves pain from a variety of sources.
Martín-Sánchez et al. (2009) were of the view that “Currently available evidence suggests that 
cannabis treatment is moderately efficacious for treatment of chronic pain, but beneficial effects 
may be partially (or completely) offset by potentially serious harms. More evidence from larger, 
well-designed trials is needed to clarify the true balance of benefits to harms.” A similar cautious 
view was expressed by Bowles et al. (2012): “The data supporting cannabinoids for pain relief have 
been mixed.” However, as illustrated by the following quotations, many researchers are enthusiastic 
about the potential value of cannabis as an analgesic. “There are well-documented reports of can-
nabis use leading to reduced headache, migraine and post-surgery pain” (Frisher et al. 2010). “There 
is evidence that cannabinoids are safe and modestly effective in neuropathic pain with preliminary 
evidence of efficacy in fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis” (Lynch and Campbell 2011). “One of 
the most promising therapeutic uses of phytocannabinoids in humans is their employment as pain 
killers” (Costa and Comelli 2014).
The comparative analgesic value of opioids and cannabinoids is of particular interest. Carter 
et al. (2015) stated, “The field of pain medicine is at a crossroads given the epidemic of addiction 
and overdose deaths from prescription opioids. Cannabis and its active ingredients, cannabinoids, 
are a much safer therapeutic option…when used appropriately, cannabis is safe and effective for 
many forms of chronic pain and other conditions, and has no overdose levels. Current literature 
indicates many chronic pain patients could be treated with cannabis alone or with lower doses of 
opioids.” The use of cannabis to complement opiates is a promising possibility. The endogenous 
opioid system produces pain-relieving endorphins, and the ECS may interact with the opioid sys-
tem in effecting pain relief. “There are emerging data suggesting that cannabinoids augment opi-
ates” (Bowles et al. 2012; also see Johnson et al. 2010, 2013; Abrams et al. 2011; Portenoy et al. 
2012). Lucas (2012) also observed that “There is a growing body of evidence to support the use of 
medical cannabis as an adjunct to or substitute for prescription opiates in the treatment of chronic 
pain.” Carter et al. (2011) noted, “Long-term drug safety is an important issue in palliative medi-
cine. Opioids may produce significant morbidity. Cannabis is a safer alternative with broad appli-
cability for palliative care.” Burns and Ineck (2006) observed that “Chronic pain often requires 
a polypharmaceutical approach to management, and cannabinoids are a potential addition to the 
arsenal of treatment options.”
pARkInson’s dIseAse
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive disorder of the central nervous system that affects 
movement and coordination. It is characterized by a fixed inexpressive facial expression, tremors, 
slowing of voluntary movements, gait with short accelerating steps, peculiar posture, and muscle 
weakness. Most patients are over 50. The condition is caused by death (for unknown reasons) of 
 

334
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
dopamine-producing neurons in the midbrain (dopamine is an important neurotransmitter, reduced 
levels interfering with coordination and motor function).
“Potential use of cannabinoids in PD is controversial” (Venderová et al. 2004). Carroll et al. 
(2004) found that “orally administered cannabis extract resulted in no objective or subjective 
improvement in dyskinesias [involuntary movement disorders] or parkinsonism.” Koppel et al. 
(2014) concluded that cannabis is “probably ineffective” in treating PD. By contrast, Lotan et al. 
(2014) observed significant improvement after treatment in tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow 
movement), sleep, and pain and stated that their study “suggests that cannabis might have a place in 
the therapeutic armamentarium of PD.” Fernández-Ruiz et al. (2014b) stated, “it seems obvious that 
phytocannabinoids constitute potential novel neuroprotective therapies for PD… The phytocannabi-
noid Δ9-THCV emerges as an interesting compound to be used alone or in combination with CBD.” 
Gómez-Gálvez et al. (2015) found evidence of elevated levels of CB2 receptors in mice models of 
Parkinson’s as well as in postmortem patients, suggesting that this is an adaptive response that may 
be harnessed to alleviate the disease. Russo (2007) emphasized that prolonged administration of 
cannabis may be necessary before improvements in PD symptoms become evident. Concannon et 
al. (2015) concluded, “There is mounting evidence to suggest that the endocannabinoid system may 
have multiple therapeutic benefits in the treatment of PD. Evidence suggests that cannabinoid drugs 
have the potential to alleviate the symptoms of the condition as well as to ameliorate the debilitat-
ing motor side effects associated with current pharmacotherapies. Moreover the endocannabinoid 
system may also have the potential to modify the progression of the disease…our expanding knowl-
edge of the endocannabinoid system gives cause for optimism for improved understanding and 
treatment of PD.”
psychIATRIc dIsoRdeRs
Although estimates are uncertain, between one-quarter and one-third of the world’s population, 
at some point in their lives, are believed to suffer from some form of mental disorder. Anxiety, 
depression, and schizophrenia are leading mental illnesses in Western countries. Electrical and neu-
rotransmitter activities in the brain are important in determining healthy mental status, and abnor-
mal symptoms are often correlated with abnormal nerve cell functioning. Because the ECS is vital 
in the health and pathology of nerve cells, cannabis has potential therapeutic value in maintaining 
or restoring health. However, there is hardly unanimity about the role of cannabinoids. As pointed 
out by Fride and Russo (2005), “The history and science of cannabis and cannabinoids and their 
relation to mental health and disease are fraught with controversy, ambivalence, and contradictory 
claims.” Nevertheless, as noted by Patel and Hillard (2009), “preclinical and clinical data suggest 
a role for endogenous cannabinoid signaling in the modulation of anxiety and depression… These 
data provide evidence that ECS serves in an anxiolytic, and possibly anti-depressant, role. These 
data suggest novel approaches to treatment of affective disorders which could include enhancement 
of endogenous cannabinoid signaling.”
Leweke and Koethe (2008) concluded that investigation of the ECS in relation to psychiatric 
conditions “provides a promising target for novel pharmacotherapeutic interventions.” Similarly, 
Crippa et al. (2010) stated, “The cannabinoid system is a promising target for novel therapeutic 
interventions in psychiatry. Cannabinoids may be greatly useful in this field; however, additional 
controlled trials are still required to confirm these findings and determine the safety of these com-
pounds.” Less optimistically, Wyrofsky et al. (2015) commented “The endocannabinoid (eCB) sys-
tem plays an important role in the control of mood, and its dysregulation has been implicated in 
several psychiatric disorders. Targeting the eCB system appears to represent an attractive and novel 
approach to the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. However, several failed clinical 
trials have diminished enthusiasm for the continued development of eCB-targeted therapeutics for 
psychiatric disorders, despite the encouraging preclinical data and promising preliminary results 
obtained with the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone for treating post-traumatic stress disorder.”

Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
Addiction
Addiction refers to obsessive thinking about and compulsive consumption of something despite 
resulting negative consequences (De Luca and Fattore 2015). Pathological compulsions for danger, 
drugs, food, gambling, and sex are common.
“The endocannabinoid system appears to be strongly associated with the neurobiological pro-
cesses that underlie addictive disorders” (Fernández-Ruiz et al. 2014a). Cannabinoid CB1 receptors 
are present in areas of the brain involved in reward processes, and when activated, they gener-
ate rewarding effects (De Luca and Fattore 2015). “Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids appear to 
boost the rewarding effects of addictive drugs, including alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, 
and opiates, suggesting that the endocannabinoid system may represent an important target for the 
treatment of addictive disorders” (De Luca and Fattore 2015). Although habit-forming drugs such as 
opioids, cocaine, tobacco, and alcohol are known to affect the CB1 receptors in laboratory animals 
(CB2 receptors have been found to play a role as well in cocaine addiction), therapeutic applications 
to humans have not yet been formulated (Fernández-Ruiz et al. 2014a).
Cannabis induces dependence less readily than the majority of other illicit drugs. Nevertheless, 
about 9% of marijuana users become dependent, and dependence increases up to 17% among those 
who initiate use at a young age (De Luca and Fattore 2015). It has been hypothesized that cannabis 
dependence could be addressed therapeutically by targeting the ECS (Clapper et al. 2009), a rather 
ironic scenario of using cannabinoids to cure cannabinoid addiction.
Anxiety
Anxiety drugs are among the top-selling prescription pharmaceuticals. Crippa et al. (2009) noted 
that although cannabis users have a high prevalence of anxiety disorders and, conversely, patients 
with anxiety disorders have relatively high rates of cannabis use, it is unclear if cannabis use 
increases the risk of developing anxiety disorders. “Anxiety disorders are the most common psy-
chiatric disorders in the general population, and there is a particularly high incidence of cannabis 
use in patients with symptoms of anxiety and anxiety disorders…preclinical studies support the 
hypothesis that low doses and infrequent exposure to cannabis constituents can reduce feelings of 
anxiety and stress but that chronic use of large amounts has the opposite effect and could contrib-
ute to the development of anxiety and other psychiatric disorders” (Patel et al. 2014). The biphasic 
effects of cannabis (whether contributing to or alleviating anxiety) were examined by Rey et al. 
(2012). “Several studies have demonstrated a positive impact of CBD alone on anxiety in patients 
with social anxiety disorder” (Curran and Morgan 2014). Also see the information for posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) presented later in this section.
Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder, often simply called autism, includes a set of neurodevelopmental disor-
ders characterized by complications in social interaction, impaired communication, and restricted, 
repetitive, stereotyped behaviors or interests (see Miles 2011 for a review). Asperger’s syndrome 
(Asperger syndrome) is a form of autism on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum 
(IQs typically are in the normal to very superior range). No single psychopharmacologic treat-
ment is applicable to autism, and concern has been expressed about the many toxic pharmaceutical 
medications that have been employed to treat the symptoms. Kurz and Blaas (2010) noted: “autistic 
children often show aggression against others and self-injurious behaviour, [and] also have sleep 
problems and eating disorders. Early infant autism affects 1 of 2000 children, with boys affected 
three times more often than girls. Autism does not equate with mental retardation, but intelligence 
is frequently limited (intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70). One quarter of autistic children achieve 
good results on IQ tests, termed ‘high functional autism.’ The cause of autism is still not fully 
explored, but seems to be multifactorial (including genetic, environmental and neurobiochemical 
disorders)… To date there have been no reports of the use of cannabinoids in autism. However, in 
internet blogs and discussion forums there are many reports of parents who have tried THC for their 
 

336
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
autistic children, but without medical monitoring and inappropriate administration.” Grinspoon 
(2010) argued for the right of parents to conduct such experimentation in the light of desperation to 
alleviate their child’s condition.
Onaivi et al. (2011), Busquets-Garcia et al. (2013), and Földy et al. (2013) suggested (based on 
rodent data) that the cannabinoid system is implicated in the development of autism. Khalil (2012) 
stated: “There has been a massive growth of public awareness and research funding around autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD) over the past 10 years… CBD and delta-9-THC may help in improv-
ing symptoms of ASD by their sedative, antipsychotic, anti-convulsant and tranquilizing effects.” 
Siniscalco et al. (2013) observed a much higher development of CB2 receptors in autistic children 
compared to normal children, suggesting the involvement of the ECS in autism development or 
maintenance.
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder, 
affecting about 40 million worldwide. ADHD is noted for lack of attention (distractability) and 
control of inhibitions, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. It is the most common psychiatric condition 
in children and adolescents, affecting about three times as many boys as girls, beginning between 
the ages of 6 to 12 and often impairing school performance. The condition tends to become more 
manageable in adults, with a prevalence rate of 4.4% (McRae-Clark et al. 2010). The diagnosis and 
treatment have been controversial, especially insofar as it has involved prescribing drugs for chil-
dren. The use of marijuana to treat children is particularly controversial because of the potential 
adverse effects on the developing brain.
Marijuana has been reported to be the most commonly used drug by adults with ADHD 
(McRae-Clark et al. 2010). Pedersen (2014), in a study of people who had self-diagnosed an ill-
ness and purchased marijuana for medical purposes in Norway, found that treatment of ADHD 
was the most commonly reported justification. Indeed, ADHD is often alleged to be the rationale 
for employing medical marijuana, although controlled studies of its efficacy are absent. However, 
there is at least an intuitive reason for using cannabis to treat ADHD. Wiskerske and Pattij (2015) 
pointed out, “Given its widespread and abundant expression in the brain and its known impor-
tant role in other executive functions such as working memory, attention, time estimation, and 
behavioral flexibility, it should come as no surprise that the endocannabinoid system mediates 
impulsive behavior…the endocannabinoid system emerges as an interesting pharmacotherapeu-
tic target to ameliorate impulsivity in psychopathology and neurological disorders.” Strohbeck-
Kuehner et al. (2008) provide an anecdotal report of improvement of ADHD in an individual 
treated with cannabis.
Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder (bipolar affective disorder, manic-depressive illness) is a mental condition char-
acterized by recurrent alternations of elevated mood (mania, characterized by expansive mood, 
decreased sleep, increased energy, and impulsive behavior) and depressed mood (depression, dis-
cussed next). About 3% of the world population develops bipolar disorder at some period of their 
lives. People with bipolar disorder frequently consume marijuana, surveys often showing a greater 
prevalence than for other misused drugs (Braga et al. 2015).
Ashton et al. (2005) commented, “Both THC and CBD have pharmacological properties that 
could be therapeutic in patients with bipolar affective disorder.” Braga et al. (2015) stated, “advances 
in neurobiological research have facilitated greater understanding of the role of the endocannabi-
noid system in bipolar disorder and how cannabinoid modulators may serve as a treatment for the 
illness. To date, a few animal studies and anecdotal reports have suggested potential therapeutic 
effects. It should be noted that at this time, no definitive evidence suggests cannabis may be benefi-
cial in any way.”

Depression
Unlike the ups and downs that everyone experiences, the symptoms of clinical depression are 
severe. “Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses with a lifetime prevalence of 
about 15%–20%, resulting in enormous personal suffering, as well as social and economic bur-
den. The major depressive disorder is characterized by episodes of depressed mood lasting for 
more than two weeks often associated with feelings of guilt, decreased interest in pleasurable 
activities and inability to experience pleasure (named anhedonia), low self-esteem and worthless-
ness, high anxiety, disturbed sleep patterns and appetite, impairment in memory and suicidal 
ideation” (Micale et al. 2015).
Denson and Earleywine (2006) surveyed marijuana users and suggested that “adults apparently 
do not increase their risk for depression by using marijuana.” Patel et al. (2014) found that “studies 
examining the ability of cannabis and cannabinoids to reduce depression have yielded contradictory 
findings.”
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
PTSD is a pathological response to experiencing or witnessing severe traumatic events, such as 
combat, disaster, sexual abuse, violent crime, or accidents. It is characterized by mentally reexperi-
encing the event (frequently as flashbacks or nightmares) and often behavioral avoidance, hypervig-
ilance, and anxiety. The condition appears to represent a situation where memories are best erased. 
The amygdala of the brain is important for emotional learning and memory, and endocannabinoids 
potentially could represent a key route to extinguishing unpleasant memories from this region of the 
brain. Elevated usage of marijuana has been associated with PTSD (Cougle et al. 2011).
Passie et al. (2012) stated, “Evidence is increasingly accumulating that cannabinoids might play 
a role in fear extinction and antidepressive effects…studies are warranted in order to evaluate the 
therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in PTSD.” Patel et al. (2014) pointed out that “Data suggest a 
strong association between PTSD and cannabis use, and that subjects with PTSD use cannabis to 
reduce PTSD symptom severity. However, whether long-term outcomes are improved or worsened 
by cannabis use in PTSD patients remains to be determined.” Gabbay et al. (2015) commented, 
“Substantial evidence suggests that endocannabinoid signaling is deficient in PTSD, thereby recom-
mending the endocannabinoid system as a therapeutic target for that disorder. The endocannabinoid 
system is also a target for treatment of anxiety disorders, emotion dysregulation, depression, and 
cannabis use disorder, all of which are associated with PTSD. Moreover, as preclinical evidence 
suggests that the endocannabinoid system regulates fear memory processing and extinction, enhanc-
ing endocannabinoid function may ameliorate core deficits in PTSD. However, multiple challenges 
confront the effort to develop endocannabinoid-targeting therapies.” Greer et al. (2014), based on a 
survey of patients, concluded, “Though currently there is no substantial proof of the efficacy of can-
nabis in PTSD treatment, the data reviewed here supports a conclusion that cannabis is associated 
with PTSD symptom reduction in some patients, and that a prospective, placebo-controlled study 
of cannabis or its constituents for treatment of PTSD is warranted.” Neumeister et al. (2013) used a 
radioactive tracer detected by positron emission tomography to examine the brains of patients with 
PTSD (designated TC) as well as controls (HC). They reported: “Anandamide concentrations were 
reduced in the PTSD relative to the TC (53.1% lower) and HC (58.2% lower) groups… These results 
suggest that abnormal CB1 receptor-mediated anandamide signaling is implicated in the etiology of 
PTSD, and provide a promising neurobiological model to develop novel, evidence-based pharmaco-
therapies for this disorder.”
Schizophrenia
“Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by impairments in the perception 
or expression of reality. Schizophrenic symptoms are subclassified into positive (or productive) 
symptoms such as delusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorder, and negative (or deficit) 
 

338

symptoms such as blunted affect and emotion, poverty of speech, anhedonia [inability to experience 
pleasure in normally pleasurable acts], and lack of motivation. For many patients the prognosis is 
poor with incomplete recovery and significant illness” (Müller-Vahl and Emrich 2008).
Although “there is substantial evidence that heavy cannabis abuse in healthy persons is a risk 
factor for the clinical manifestation of schizophrenia, CBD may be effective in the treatment of 
patients suffering from acute schizophrenia” (Müller-Vahl and Emrich 2008). The same view has 
been suggested by Leweke et al. (2012), Bossong et al. (2014), Parolaro et al. (2014), and Robson 
et al. (2014). Rohleder and Leweke (2015) concluded, “There is a strong relationship between the 
ECS, cannabis use, and schizophrenia. On the one hand, the ECS has to be regarded as part of the 
pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while on the other hand, cannabis use may contribute to weaken 
this system, a system that most likely plays a protective role in the neurobiology of this disease. 
Targeting this mechanism may become a viable new approach to the treatment of schizophrenia.”
skIn condITIons
The skin is the largest organ of the body, its apparent simplicity belying astonishing complex-
ity and importance. Skin has numerous functions, including protecting the body from microbial 
invasion, allergens, ultraviolet exposure, water, and chemicals; sensing heat, cold, touch, pressure, 
vibration, pain, itch, and injury; producing hair; controlling temperature (using sweat glands to 
control temperature; employing sense organs that regulate blood constriction to control skin tem-
perature; containing fat that acts as insulation); and synthesizing hormones (best known of which 
is vitamin D).
CB1 and CB2 receptors occur extensively in the skin (Ständer et al. 2005), and its ECS influences 
various biological processes, including cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, programmed cell 
death, and hormonal functions (Bíró et al. 2009). Cannabinoids have been shown to have anti-
inflammatory effect on skin (Tubaro et al. 2010). Pathological skin conditions and diseases that are 
potentially influenced by the ECS include general symptoms such as itch and pain, tumors, as well 
as the following conditions (Bíró et al. 2009).
Acne and Seborrhea
Acne (acne vulgaris), one of the most common skin conditions, is characterized by increased 
production of sebum (an oily product of the sebaceous glands, which waterproofs the skin) and 
inflammation of the sebaceous glands, induced or aggravated by factors such as stress and diet and 
common in adolescence. Seborrhea is an inflammatory skin condition particularly affecting areas 
of skin enriched by sebaceous glands. It is similar to acne, and indeed, acne and seborrhea are the 
most common dermatological diseases.
The sebaceous glands have endocannabinoid receptors, as do various skin cells, and there has 
been interest in the possibility that research, particularly with CBD, might produce a cannabinoid-
based medicine to treat acne (Gardner 2010). Oláh et al. (2014) concluded that “CBD has potential 
as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of acne vulgaris.”
Alopecia
Alopecia is a pathological hair loss particularly affecting the scalp (effluvium is a form of alopecia 
characterized by diffuse hair shedding).
Smoking marijuana has been claimed to reduce levels of plasma testosterone (e.g., Okosun et al. 
2014), the principal androgen of men (androgens include any hormones that stimulate male repro-
ductive traits and behavior). Consistent with this, Purohit et al. (1980) found that forms of cannabis 
acted as androgen antagonists, suggesting to some that baldness in men (which is exacerbated by 
male hormones) could be alleviated by consuming marijuana. Curiously, however, a debate is com-
mon on the Internet about whether or not consuming marijuana causes, rather than prevents, hair 
loss, a question that has not been decided.
 

339
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
The subject of hair loss is a great psychological stress to many, and cannabis has become inti-
mately associated with this subject. Forensic departments frequently test for the illicit consumption 
of marijuana by sampling the cannabinoid content of hair samples, reflecting the fact that can-
nabinoids accumulate in hair, but it is unclear if this influences hair growth. Facetiously, smoking 
marijuana joints (especially roaches, i.e., the butts after most of the joint has been consumed) has 
caused hair loss by setting moustaches ablaze.
Dermatitis
Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin, caused by various factors such as allergens (“allergic 
dermatitis”), infections, eczema (“atopic dermatitis”), external compounds (“contact dermatitis”), 
and so on.
Karsak et al. (2007) noted, “Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 5% of men and 11% of 
women in industrialized countries and is one of the leading causes for occupational diseases. In an 
animal model for cutaneous contact hypersensitivity, we show that… cannabinoid receptor antago-
nists exacerbated allergic inflammation, whereas receptor agonists attenuated inflammation. These 
results demonstrate a protective role of the endocannabinoid system in contact allergy in the skin 
and suggest a target for therapeutic intervention.” Campora et al. (2012) found that “The endocan-
nabinoid system and cannabimimetic compounds protect against effects of allergic inflammatory 
disorders in various species of mammals…this system may be a target for treatment of immune-
mediated and inflammatory disorders such as allergic skin diseases.”
Hirsutism
Hirsutism refers to excessive and increased hair growth (especially in women) on body regions 
where the occurrence of hair normally is minimal or absent.
Telek et al. (2007) found experimentally that they could inhibit hair growth by application of 
anandamide or THC.
Pruritis
Pruritis is a severe itching, which can be due to several causes.
Endocannabinoids can activate itch receptors (Bin Saif et al. 2011), suggesting the potential for 
therapeutic manipulation of the ECS to reduce itching. In a preliminary study, Neff et al. (2002) 
found THC alleviated itching in several patients with the liver disease cholestatic jaundice.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by excessive production of skin cells 
and skin inflammation.
Wilkinson and Williamson (2006) concluded that there is “a potential role for cannabinoids in 
the treatment of psoriasis.”
Scleroderma
Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by diffuse fibrosis 
(accumulation of connective tissue), degenerative changes, and vascular abnormalities in the skin, 
joints, and internal organs.
Balistreri et al. (2011) found that a synthetic cannabinoid is capable of preventing skin fibrosis in 
a mouse model of scleroderma.
TouReTTe’s syndRome
Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome is a childhood-onset neurobehavioral complex of problems includ-
ing motor and verbal tics and behavioral and cognitive disorders such as obsessive-compulsive 
behavior. Motor tics are recurrent, semivoluntary brief movements. Verbal tics may be meaningless 
 

340
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
utterances, rapid and involuntary repetition, and uncontrollable obscene language. About 0.4% of 
people develop Tourette’s—four times as many males as females. The severity of the condition usu-
ally abates in adulthood.
Koppel et al. (2014) concluded that cannabis is of unknown efficacy in treating the symptoms 
of Tourette’s syndrome. Other researchers have provided more optimistic evaluations. Curtis et 
al. (2009) stated that “Cannabinoid medication might be useful in the treatment of the symp-
toms in patients with Tourette’s syndrome.” Hazekamp and Grotenhermen (2010) concluded that 
studies have shown that THC has promising effects on tics and behavioral problems associated 
with Tourette’s syndrome. Kluger et al. (2015) stated, “clinical observations and clinical trials of 
cannabinoid-based therapies suggest a possible benefit of cannabinoids for tics.” Müller-Vahl (2013) 
noted that “Available data…consistently provide evidence for beneficial effects of cannabinoid-
based medicines in the treatment of tics in patients with Tourette’s syndrome. In addition, there is 
some evidence that cannabinoid-based medicines may also improve associated behavioral problems 
such as obsessive compulsive behavior, attention deficits, impulsivity, and self-injurious behavior in 
this group of patients… It can be assumed that beneficial effects of cannabinoid-based medicines 
in Tourette’s syndrome are caused by modulations of the CB1 receptor system, rather than unspeci-
fied effects such as sedation or decreased general activity.” Müller-Vahl (2013) stated that “THC is 
recommended for the treatment of Tourette’s syndrome in adult patients, when first line treatments 
failed to improve the tics. In treatment resistant adult patients, therefore, treatment with THC should 
be taken into consideration.”
MEDICAL APPLICATION OF SPECIFIC CANNABINOIDS
Apart from the medical use of herbal marijuana, increasing efforts are underway to establish the 
efficacy of specific cannabinoids. THC, CBD, and CBN are the most studied cannabinoids. Howard 
et al. (2013) commented, “Currently available cannabinoids all contain the psychoactive constituent 
of Cannabis sativa, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) or a synthetic analogue. They are gener-
ally less effective or less well tolerated than alternative drugs and are relatively expensive… Their 
analgesic effect is modest.” Hill et al. (2012) stated: “Whilst Δ9-THC is the most prevalent and 
widely studied pCB [phytocannabinoid], it is also the predominant psychotropic component of 
cannabis, a property that likely limits its widespread therapeutic use as an isolated agent. In this 
regard, research focus has recently widened to include other pCBs including CBD, cannabigerol 
(CBG), Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Δ9-THCV) and cannabidivarin (CBDV), some of which show 
potential as therapeutic agents in preclinical models of CNS disease. Moreover, it is becoming evi-
dent that these non-Δ9-THC pCBs act at a wide range of pharmacological targets, not solely limited 
to CB receptors. Disorders that could be targeted include epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, 
affective disorders and the central modulation of feeding behaviour.”
TeTRAhydRocAnnAbInol
There is wide acceptance that THC is the main component of marijuana responsible for euphoria 
and mood elevation, results that may be medically advantageous for treating mood disorders. More 
than 100 metabolites of THC have been identified, notably 11-hydroxy-delta-9 THC (11-OH-THC). 
The latter produces analgesia and other psychoactive results, as well as muscle relaxant, appetite 
stimulant, and antiemetic (nausea reduction) effects. THC has been used to treat spasticity from spi-
nal injury or MS, pain, inflammation, insomnia, asthma, loss of appetite, and other conditions (Izzo 
et al. 2009; Russo and Hohmann 2013). THC is a strong analgesic (Russo and Hohmann 2013) and 
can treat pain untouched by morphine-related analgesics. THC reduces intraocular pressure and has 
been used to treat glaucoma. Other properties of THC include anti-inflammation, bronchodilation, 
and antioxidation effects. THC also affects bone remodeling, fertility, short-term memory, tumor 
growth, and motor coordination (Mechoulam 2002; Iversen 2000), although these abilities have not 
 

341
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
been translated into therapies. THC is the main promoter of hyperphagia (hunger, producing the 
“munchies,” traditionally satisfied with sweets and snacks), but other cannabinoids of C. sativa may 
also play a role (Farrimond et al. 2011).
cAnnAbIdIol
CBD has been found to affect physiology in numerous ways and is considered to have phar-
macological value for treating more pathological conditions than any other cannabinoid. This 
extraordinarily versatile cannabinoid has been claimed to have potential for therapeutic use for 
treatment of numerous diseases and symptoms, including Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, cancer, 
cerebral ischemia, congestion, convulsion, cough, diabetes, dystonia, epilepsy, hepatitis, inflam-
matory diseases, nausea, obesity, PD, skin diseases, and several psychological disorders includ-
ing ADHD, PTSD, and psychosis (Zuardi et al. 2006; Zuardi 2008). Fernández-Ruiz et al. (2013) 
commented, “CBD acts in some experimental models as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, 
anti-oxidant, anti-emetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent, and is therefore a potential medi-
cine for the treatment of neuroinflammation, epilepsy, oxidative injury, vomiting and nausea, 
anxiety and schizophrenia, respectively. The neuroprotective potential of CBD, based on the 
combination of its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, is of particular interest.” As 
noted in the following, for several conditions, there has been experimental investigation of the 
efficacy of CBD.
CBD is credited with analgesic, anticonvulsant, antiemetic, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, 
muscle relaxant, anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing), neuroprotective, antioxidant, and antipsychotic 
activity (Russo and Guy 2006; Mechoulam et al. 2007). CBD also results in reduction of intraocular 
pressure. “CBD produces its biological effects without exerting significant intrinsic activity upon 
cannabinoid receptors. For this reason, CBD lacks the unwanted psychotropic effects characteristic 
of marijuana derivatives, so representing one of the bioactive constituents of Cannabis sativa with 
the highest potential for therapeutic use” (Scuderi et al. 2009). As stressed elsewhere in this review, 
CBD antagonizes the psychotropic effects of THC and so can be employed for moderating effects 
such as anxiety, intoxication, hunger, sedation, and increase in heart rate produced by THC (Russo 
et al. 2015). CBD also reduces the appetite-stimulating effect of THC (Morgan et al. 2010). Izzo 
et al. (2009) stated, “CBD exerts several positive pharmacological effects that make it a highly 
attractive therapeutic entity in inflammation, diabetes, cancer and affective or neurodegenerative 
diseases” and “CBD has an extremely safe profile in humans, and it has been clinically evaluated 
(albeit in a preliminary fashion) for the treatment of anxiety, psychosis, and movement disorders. 
There is good pre-clinical evidence to warrant clinical studies into its use for the treatment of dia-
betes, ischemia and cancer.” Martin-Santos et al. (2012) concluded that “in healthy volunteers, THC 
has marked acute behavioural and physiological effects, whereas CBD has proven to be safe and 
well tolerated.”
One of the more interesting studies of the potential practical value of CBD is that of Yang et al. 
(2014), who found that CBD protects the liver from damage from acute alcohol drinking, at least 
in mice.
Hemp strains are relatively high in CBD and low in THC, and so their resin is a natural source 
for extracted CBD. Oilseed hemp strains have often been selected to produce a congested head (to 
facilitate collection of seeds), but if grown in a seedless (sinsemilla) form, the flowering head could 
be used as “bud” material for smoking. Some medicinal strains of C. sativa have been selected 
for very high production of CBD coupled with very low THC. The Tikun Olam company in Israel 
developed the strain Avidekel, reportedly producing a product (debatably called “highless mari-
juana”) containing 15.8% CBD and only traces of THC (see Chapter 8 for additional discussion of 
highless marijuana).
The following is a selection of conditions found to be beneficially affected by CBD. In fact, there 
are indications that dozens of illnesses might benefit from this remarkable cannabinoid.
 

342
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Arthritis
Based on rodent studies, Malfait et al. (2000) found “that CBD, through its combined immunosup-
pressive and anti-inflammatory actions, has a potent anti-arthritic effect.” “CBD exerts anti-arthritic 
actions through a combination of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects” (Izzo et al. 
2009). Additional information was provided previously, in the general discussion of arthritis.
Cancer
Although as discussed previously, marijuana is not a cure for cancer, there is evidence that cannabi-
noids “are promising regulators of malignant cell growth” and that data “support the clinical testing 
of CBD against… carcinoma” (De Petrocellis et al. 2013; cf. Pacher 2013). “The non-psychoactive 
plant-derived cannabinoid CBD exhibits pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative actions in different 
types of tumours and may also exert anti-migratory, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic and perhaps anti-
angiogenic properties. On the basis of these results, evidence is emerging to suggest that CBD is a 
potent inhibitor of both cancer growth and spread” (Massi et al. 2013).
Diabetes
Weiss et al. (2008) found that CBD was useful in preventing diabetes in experimental mice. Izzo et 
al. (2009) commented, “CBD exerts beneficial actions against diabetes and some of its complications 
(e.g., retinal damage). The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective actions of CBD could 
contribute to these protective effects.” Di Marzo et al. (2011) conjectured that CBD may be useful in 
reducing the damage from diabetes in humans. Also see the information for diabetes presented earlier.
Epilepsy
The therapeutic value of CBD for epilepsy is uncertain (Zuardi 2008). Jones et al. (2010), Porter and 
Jacobson (2013), Cilio et al. (2014), Devinsky et al. (2014), and others have noted that CBD is anti-
convulsant and deserves to be evaluated for its ability to treat the disease. Welty et al. (2014) stated, 
“At this time, there does seem to be a growing body of basic pharmacologic data suggesting there 
may be a role for CBD, especially in the treatment of refractory epilepsy…further clinical research 
should be wholeheartedly pursued.”
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
CBD is anti-inflammatory (Bowles et al. 2012) and so has potential value for treating inflammatory 
diseases. Commenting on the value of CBD for treating inflammatory bowel diseases, Esposito 
et al. (2013) stated that it “possesses an extraordinary range of beneficial effects that may slow 
the course of the disease, ameliorate symptoms and potentially increase the efficacy of the drugs 
actually available for the therapy of invalidating gut disorders such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s 
disease.”
Nausea and Vomiting
Rock et al. (2012) commented, “CBD acts in a biphasic manner, such that low doses suppress toxin-
induced vomiting but high doses potentiate or have no effect on vomiting.”
Neurodegenerative Diseases
“CBD is a well-known antioxidant, exerting neuroprotective actions that might be relevant to the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and 
Huntington’s disease” (Izzo et al. 2009).
Pain
Costa et al. (2007), on the basis of rodent studies, found that “Cannabidiol, the major psycho-
inactive component of cannabis, has substantial anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects” 
against pain.
 

343
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
Psychiatric Disorders
CBD has been found to be anxiety-reducing and has significance for this and other psychological 
problems, including depression and psychosis (Campos et al. 2012). “Experimental results suggest 
that it exerts antipsychotic actions and is associated with fewer adverse effects compared with ‘typi-
cal antipsychotics’” (Izzo et al. 2009). “Most clinical studies with normal subjects or schizophrenic 
patients suggest that CBD has antipsychotic properties” (Campos et al. 2012). “Evidence suggests 
that CBD can ameliorate…symptoms of schizophrenia” (Deiana 2013). Leweke et al. (2012) found 
that CBD “exerts clinically relevant antipsychotic effects that are associated with marked tolerabil-
ity and safety, when compared with current medications.” Campos et al. (2012) concluded, “CBD is 
a safe compound with a wide range of therapeutic applications, including the treatment of psychi-
atric disorders. These findings make this drug an attractive candidate for future clinical use” and 
“this natural cannabinoid should be considered as a potential approach for the treatment of mood 
disorders.” Rock et al. (2012) commented that CBD “has been shown to protect against cerebral 
ischaemia, inflammation, anxiety and, most recently, depression and even addiction.” De Mello 
Schier et al. (2014) noted that “Anxiety and depression are pathologies that affect human beings 
in many aspects of life, including social life, productivity and health. Cannabidiol is a constituent 
non-psychotomimetic of Cannabis sativa with great psychiatric potential, including uses as an anti-
depressant-like and anxiolytic-like compound.” Schubart et al. (2014) stated, “Although cannabis 
use is associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis…evidence from several research 
domains suggests that CBD shows potential for antipsychotic treatment.” Prud’homme et al. (2015) 
reviewed the literature on addictive behavior in relation to CBD and concluded that “preclinical 
studies suggest that CBD may have therapeutic properties on opioid, cocaine, and psychostimulant 
addiction, and some preliminary data suggest that it may be beneficial in cannabis and tobacco 
addiction in humans. Further studies are clearly necessary to fully evaluate the potential of CBD as 
an intervention for addictive disorders.” Curran and Morgan (2014) consider CBD to be “a candi-
date treatment for disorders of pathological fear memory, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and 
phobias.” “CBD bears investigation in…neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophre-
nia, addiction, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. However, we lack data from well-
powered double-blind randomized, controlled studies on the efficacy of pure CBD for any disorder” 
(Devinsky et al. 2014).
cAnnAbInol
CBN (recall that this is considered to be a degenerative artefact of THC) is weakly psycho tropic 
(Russo 2007). It has been shown experimentally to have anticonvulsant and anti-inflammatory 
effects, ability to promote skin and bone growth, decrease heart rate and intestinal motility, and 
inhibit platelet aggregation and is considered to have some medical potential (Izzo et al. 2009).
oTheR nATuRAl cAnnAbInoIds
All cannabinoids may have pharmacological value, but in addition to those mentioned previously, 
the following, which are relatively common in some strains, are most often mentioned as having 
medical potential (for discussion, see Russo 2011a).
Tetrahydrocannabivarin
Δ9-THCV, a nonpsychoactive analogue of THC, can block cannabinoid receptors. “THCV seems to 
be a promising therapeutic compound because it has been shown to behave as a CB1 receptor antag-
onist; at the same time, it activates CB2 receptors, thereby decreasing inflammation and oxidative 
stress” (Horváth et al. 2012). Similarly García et al. (2011) observed, “Given its antioxidant proper-
ties and its ability to activate CB2 but to block CB1 receptors, Δ9-THCV has a promising pharma-
cological profile for delaying disease progression in Parkinson’s disease and also for ameliorating 
 

344
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
parkinsonian symptoms.” McPartland et al. (2015) reviewed medical research on THCV and 
emphasized that its effects on CB receptors are complex, and it may demonstrate contradictory 
actions in in vitro (test tube) and in vivo (living animal) experiments. The following rodent studies 
suggest that it has therapeutic value. THCV has the capacity to reduce the intoxication of THC and 
has been shown to have anticonvulsant and anti-inflammatory properties (Bolognini et al. 2010), 
and to be capable of inducing weight loss in diabetic mice (Wargent et al. 2013). Hill et al. (2010), 
based on rat studies, demonstrated that THCV suppresses epileptic and seizure activity. Horváth 
et al. (2012) suggested that THCV may have value in treating diabetes. Cascio et al. (2015) found 
that THCV has apparent antipsychotic effects and that it “has therapeutic potential for ameliorating 
some of the negative, cognitive and positive symptoms of schizophrenia.”
Cannabigerol
The nonpsychotropic cannabinoid CBG has some sedative, antibiotic, antifungal, antidepressant, 
and antihypertensive effects and decreases intraocular pressure. Borrelli et al. (2013), based on a 
study demonstrating therapeutic effects of CBG on inflammatory bowel disease in mice, suggested 
that it should be examined experimentally in patients. De Petrocellis et al. (2008) discussed the 
possibility of CBG having therapeutic effects on prostate cancer. Based on an in vivo (cell culture) 
study, Borrelli et al. (2014) found that CBG hampers colon cancer progression and inhibits the 
growth of colorectal cancer cells, and they recommended that CBG should be considered in the 
prevention and cure of colorectal cancer.
Cannabichromene
Cannabichromene has been found to exert anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, antidepres-
sant, sedative, and analgesic activity (Izzo et al. 2009, 2012), based mostly on rodent studies.
CAUTIONS REGARDING MEDICAL MARIJUANA
Extensive negative effects of cannabis usage have been documented (as noted in Chapter 12). The 
variety of behavioral, psychological, and physical symptoms that are sometimes associated with 
the consumption of cannabis drugs are reviewed extensively in the references cited previously, as 
well as in the previous chapter. The following highlights some of the more significant concerns in 
a medical context.
The effects of cannabis on reproduction have not been completely evaluated. Toxicological stud-
ies have indicated that (in acute application studies in laboratory animals) cannabinoids can reduce 
the weight of sex organs and increase the weight of liver and adrenal glands, possibly through 
effects on sex hormones. Cannabis use during pregnancy has been alleged to slightly reduce birth 
weight of the baby (Hall 2014), although such studies rarely control for use of alcohol or cigarettes 
or check nutritional status. THC is transmitted in breast milk and can cross the placenta, reaching 
concentrations in the fetus of 10% to 30% of maternal levels (Holubek 2010). Accordingly, use dur-
ing pregnancy and nursing seems (especially) contraindicated (but see information in the previous 
section dealing with morning sickness).
Cannabinoids are very lipid soluble and accumulate in fatty tissue throughout the body. They are 
released very slowly and so can persist in people for more than a month after consumption. This does 
not necessarily suggest toxicity but needs to be considered in relation to long-term use and dosage.
Wang et al. (2008a) reviewed adverse effects of the medical use of cannabis. Of about 5000 
adverse effects, most were not serious. As noted previously, death in humans due directly (i.e., short-
term) to cannabis has not been reliably determined. Dizziness was the most commonly reported 
nonserious occurrence. Of the 164 serious events, the most frequent was relapse of MS, vomiting, 
and urinary tract infection. These authors concluded that “the risks associated with long-term use 
were poorly characterized in published clinical trials and observational studies.” Grant et al. (2012) 
noted the following risks in the medicinal use of cannabis: “Over the longer term cannabis may 
 

345
Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
have unwanted systemic and psychoactive adverse effects that must be taken into consideration 
in chronic pain populations, who have high rates of co-occurring medical illness (e.g., cardiovas-
cular disease) and co-morbid psychiatric and substance use disorders. In general these effects are 
dose-related, are of mild to moderate severity, appear to decline over time, and are reported less 
frequently in experienced than in naïve users. Reviews suggest the most frequent side effects are 
dizziness or lightheadedness (30%–60%), dry mouth (10%–25%), fatigue (5%–40%), muscle weak-
ness (10%–25%), myalgia (25%), and palpitations (20%). Cough and throat irritation are reported in 
trials of smoked cannabis. Tachycardia and postural hypotension are infrequent but caution is war-
ranted in patients with cardiovascular disease, and possibly younger adults who intend to embark 
on very vigorous physical activity. At higher doses, sedation and ataxia with loss of balance are 
frequent. Participants in some but not all studies report euphoria…There can be adverse psychiat-
ric side effects. THC intoxication and euphoria can be disturbing, particularly to elderly patients. 
Anxiety and panic attacks occur, as do frank psychotic reactions (principally paranoia).” Borgelt 
et al. (2013) concluded, “Safety concerns regarding cannabis include the increased risk of develop-
ing schizophrenia with adolescent use, impairments in memory and cognition, accidental pediatric 
ingestions, and lack of safety packaging for medical cannabis formulations” and “Extreme cau-
tion should be used in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or mental disorders and 
in adolescents.” The small but real possibilities of cannabis usage triggering stroke or myocardial 
infarction are discussed by Mittleman et al. (2001), Mukamal et al. (2008), Renard et al. (2012), 
Wolff et al. (2013), and Thomas et al. (2014b) (also see the discussion of cardiovascular diseases 
presented earlier). Callaghan et al. (2013) reported that lifetime smoking of marijuana greater than 
50 times was associated with more than a twofold risk of developing lung cancer (a conclusion dis-
puted, for example, in Tashkin 2013). Risk of genotoxicity (genetic damage, including mutation) and 
carcinogenicity is considered to be low. “Although there have been suggestions that cannabis has 
adverse long-term effects on pregnancy, the immune system, fertility, and cognition, the preponder-
ance of available evidence suggests that these are far less severe than originally thought” (Iverson 
2002). “The evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that cannabis use precipitates schizo-
phrenia in vulnerable persons… There is also some evidence that cannabis use is associated with 
increased likelihood of relapse to psychosis among those who have developed a psychotic disorder” 
(Degenhardt et al. 2013). In addition to the hazards reviewed here, see the information on “Health 
Risks” concerning recreational use, presented in the previous chapter.
LIMITATIONS OF EXPERT MEDICAL GUIDANCE 
IN THE USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA
Russo et al. (2015) summed up limitations on prescribed cannabis as follows: “Physicians often lack 
training in using botanical medicines, and endocannabinoid physiology is still absent from most 
medical school curricula. Many legal cannabis patients receive permission to use cannabis from 
their physician, but must rely on formula selection and dosing instructions provided by cannabis 
growers or dispensary staff with little training or experience.”
ALLERGIES DUE TO CANNABIS SATIVA
“Allergy to marijuana is generally considered to be rare” (Tessmer et al. 2012). Nevertheless, as 
discussed in the following, a variety of allergic problems have been recorded (note Tennstedt and 
Saint-Remy 2011).
Atmospheric “aeroallergens” are a major source of allergies for people. Hemp pollen is widely 
distributed (as discussed in Chapter 4), and although not among the important sources of hay fever, 
it is a significant allergen for some people (Maloney and Brodkey 1940; Lindemayr and Jager 1980; 
Freeman 1983; Tanaka et al. 1998; Stokes et al. 2000; Singh and Kumar 2003; Mayoral et al. 2008;

Swerts et al. 2014). As with other air-borne pollen, inhalation of pollen of C. sativa has been 
observed to cause allergic rhinitis, asthma, and conjunctivitis. Wild plants and hemp plantations, 
not cultivated marijuana, are likely to be the major sources of outdoor C. sativa pollen. Sinsemilla 
marijuana is generated in the absence of male plants, so it should not be contaminated with pollen. 
Dust resulting from processing plants of C. sativa can also cause occupational allergic reactions 
(both pulmonary and cutaneous) to develop, both for hemp and marijuana, although not commonly. 
Skin (cutaneous) allergies (urticaria, pruritus) from handling plants have been recorded (Majmudar 
et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2008; Tessmer et al. 2012; Rojas Pérez-Ezquerra 2015). Several authors 
have suggested that cannabinoids, particularly THC, could directly cause allergies (reviewed in 
Ocampo and Rans 2015), but this has not been verified.
Pin prick allergy tests using macerated preparations of C. sativa have been employed to deter-
mine the proportion of people in various areas of the world who have become sensitized to the 
plant, since increasing cultivation and usage would suggest that there is increasing exposure to it. 
Larramendi et al. (2013) found that 8% of a sample of people in Spain were sensitized to canna-
bis. Sensitization to cannabis can take place indirectly through the phenomenon of cross-reactive 
sensitization—i.e., by exposure to a material which not only induces sensitivity to itself but also to 
cannabis. Armentia et al. (2011) found that an astonishing 92% of patients sensitive to tomato were 
also sensitive to cannabis (cf. De Larramendi et al. 2008). It has been suggested that the increasing 
use of cannabis has induced sensitivity to common foods (Ebo et al. 2013).
IS MARIJUANA A BONA FIDE MEDICINE? TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS
For better or worse, marijuana is being dispensed as a therapeutic agent (Figure 13.24), albeit only 
in some jurisdictions. This section reviews its relative legitimacy for various conditions.
Swiss physician and alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541; Figure 13.25) stated: “Everything is a 
poison. The difference between a poison and a medicine depends on the dose.” This profoundly 
insightful observation is taught to every medical student, but knowing that marijuana has both 
toxic and therapeutic properties doesn’t settle the simple question of whether it is a good medicine 
or a treatment of choice. As noted previously, marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids can alter 
human physiology in ways that may be medically advantageous for curing certain pathological 
states. However, not all medicines are equally efficacious for all diseases or for all people or for all 
circumstances, and the wisdom of utilizing cannabis for any particular person or malady, instead 
of alternative treatments, is unsettled. Unfortunately, medicinal aspects of cannabis are intertwined

Medical Marijuana: Theory and Practice
with its popularity as a recreational euphoric and symbol of personal freedom on the one hand and, 
on the other, concern over the harmful effects of dangerous drugs on individuals and society. It is 
embarrassingly clear that in the name of legitimate medicine, there is widespread prescribing of 
medical marijuana simply for personal enjoyment. It is equally clear that the harmful effects have 
been so exaggerated by establishment authorities that trust in research findings has been eroded.
Hazekamp and Pappus (2014) stated: “According to some, herbal cannabis, also known as mari-
juana, is a substance whose abuse potential is well documented, but whose benefits are poorly 
characterized. However, this view overlooks the fact that the harmfulness of cannabis abuse is not 
as widely accepted as often assumed, and that some therapeutic effects claimed by patients are, in 
fact, clinically supported and sometimes even produced by registered [cannabis] medicines… As a 
result, it seems hard to reach any comfortable consensus on where the line may be drawn between 
the appropriate medical use and the abuse of this plant. Instead, what we observe is an interesting 
polarization of opinions on cannabis.” Mendizábal and Adler-Graschinsky (2007) observed, “As 
in the case of the history of the therapeutic use of opioids, cannabinoid research is still the focus 
of legal and moral controversy, an issue that has powerfully contributed to the delay in the clinical 
application of these drugs.”
As noted in this chapter, there is experimental evidence that cannabis drugs are clinically useful 
for alleviating nausea, vomiting, and appetite problems, especially following radiation therapy and 
chemotherapy, notably for cancer and AIDS patients; for relieving the tremors and/or spasticity associ-
ated with MS and other neurodegenerative conditions; and for pain relief. As well, there is substantial 
anecdotal evidence that cannabis drugs are potentially useful for a host of other conditions and symp-
toms. However, Turcotte et al. (2010) concluded, “It is important that cannabinoids not be considered 
‘first-line’ therapies for conditions for which there are more supported and better-tolerated agents. 
Instead, these agents could be considered in a situation of treatment failure with standard therapies 
or as adjunctive agents where appropriate.” At present, cannabis is not considered a first-line therapy 
for any medical condition. Wilkinson and D’Souza (2014) stated: “Medical marijuana differs signifi-
cantly from other prescription medications. Evidence supporting its efficacy varies substantially and 
in general falls short of the standards required for approval of other drugs by the US Food and Drug 
FIGURE 13.25 Paracelsus, the “Father of Toxicology,” whose observations bear on the medicinal nature of 
marijuana. This public domain painting is one of many copies of the lost original by artist Quentin Matsys 
(1466–1530).

Administration (FDA). Some evidence suggests that marijuana may have efficacy in chemotherapy-
induced vomiting, cachexia in HIV/AIDS patients, spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, and 
neuropathic pain. However, the evidence for use in other conditions—including posttraumatic stress 
disorder, glaucoma, Crohn disease, and Alzheimer disease—relies largely on testimonials instead of 
adequately powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials. For most of these 
conditions, medications that have been subjected to the rigorous approval process of the FDA already 
exist.” Hill (2015) surveyed the medical literature on cannabis and concluded, “Use of marijuana for 
chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis is supported by high-quality 
evidence… Medical marijuana is used to treat a host of indications, a few of which have evidence 
to support treatment with marijuana and many that do not. Physicians should educate patients about 
medical marijuana to ensure that it is used appropriately and that patients will benefit from its use.”
Whiting et al. (2015) examined the literature on cannabis with respect to benefits and adverse 
effects. Specifically examined were randomized clinical trials dealing with nausea and vomiting 
due to chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity due to MS or para-
plegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psychosis, glaucoma, and Tourette’s syndrome. 
They concluded that “There was moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for 
the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that can-
nabinoids were associated with improvements in nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, weight 
gain in HIV infection, sleep disorders, and Tourette syndrome. Cannabinoids were associated with 
an increased risk of short-term adverse effects.”
Friedman and Devinsky (2015) reviewed the medical literature relating cannabis and epilepsy 
and concluded “The use of medical cannabis for the treatment of epilepsy could go the way of 
vitamin and nutritional supplements, for which the science never caught up to the hype and was 
drowned out by unverified claims, sensational testimonials, and clever marketing.” Cannabis is cur-
rently being similarly advocated for dozens of illnesses, without adequate demonstration of effec-
tiveness, and it is inevitable that some conditions will not prove to be usefully treated with it.
Despite thousands of research studies and the recent publication of dozens of comprehensive 
science-based reviews regarding the pros and cons of medical marijuana, there is not yet a consen-
sus that any particular cannabis-based treatment is preferable to other available therapies, at least 
for the majority of patients. Testimonials to the efficacy of medical marijuana are widespread, but 
there are also cautions regarding possible significantly deleterious effects, particularly on youth and 
psychologically susceptible individuals.
However, there is a consensus that further research is required. Almost every recent published 
analysis of the medical nature of cannabis (including this book) concludes that more research is 
needed to assess the relative costs/benefits of marijuana employed for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, 
study is required before it can be concluded indisputably that cannabis is the most appropriate 
therapy for any particular condition or person.
Aggarwal et al. (2009) nicely evaluated the controversy over medical marijuana: “Arguably can-
nabis is neither a miracle compound nor the answer to everyone’s ills. Yet it is not a plant that 
deserves the tremendous legal and societal commotion that has occurred over it.” At least a minority 
of medical marijuana patients and their caregivers become so convinced of the value of cannabis 
that further discussion becomes fruitless; conversely, the view that marijuana is an unredeemable 
drug of abuse remains prevalent. Given the controversies and emotion associated with marijuana, 
it is probably impossible to state an evaluation of its current and potential medicinal value that will 
satisfy a majority of society or even the most informed minority. Nevertheless, the following tenta-
tive conclusion is offered. Medicinal cannabis and technologies for its usage currently appear to 
possess modest value for treating some illnesses but may have much greater potential for alleviating 
a wide variety of ailments. The endocannabinoid system of the body has such profound significance 
for human health that its medical manipulation may one day, with considerable probability, have 
outstanding therapeutic value. The persisting conviction that accepting marijuana as a legitimate 
medicine compromises society’s “War on Drugs” remains a roadblock to research. Smoking and the 
 

349

consequent exposure to hundreds of toxic chemicals is universally viewed as extremely undesirable 
medically, and the production of new pharmacological products that deliver cannabinoids efficiently 
is a key to the future acceptance of medicinal marijuana.
MEDICAL-ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES OF LEGALIZATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA
There are endless numbers of publications arguing the merits for and against allowing the usage 
of medical marijuana from an ethical perspective. Aside from perspectives based exclusively on 
“human rights,” the viewpoints of physicians and medical ethicists are particularly important 
because they are actually confronted with a wide variety of challenging situations. Thompson and 
Koenen (2011) noted: “There are compelling arguments both for and against the use of medical 
cannabis. Those who support its medical use argue that marijuana can be an effective medication 
to reduce suffering for patients who have exhausted all other means of treating a condition. Those 
who argue against the medical use of marijuana cite the lack of data on its safety and efficacy, an 
ever-expanding list of conditions that the drug is purported to treat, and fear that recommendations 
for medical marijuana are a physician’s blessing for drug abuse.”
The following statements are representative of the viewpoint that medical marijuana should not 
be available:
There is some evidence to support the use of marijuana for nausea and vomiting related to chemo-
therapy, specific pain syndromes, and spasticity from multiple sclerosis. However, for most other indi-
cations…such as hepatitis C, Crohn disease, Parkinson disease, or Tourette syndrome, the evidence 
supporting its use is of poor quality… Evidence justifying marijuana use for various medical conditions 
will require the conduct of adequately powered, double-blind, randomized, placebo/active controlled 
clinical trials to test its short- and long-term efficacy and safety… Since medical marijuana is not a life-
saving intervention, it may be prudent to wait before widely adopting its use until high-quality evidence 
is available to guide the development of a rational approval process. (D’Souza and Ranganathan 2015)
Empirical and clinical studies clearly demonstrate significant adverse effects of cannabis smok-
ing on physical and mental health as well as its interference with social and occupational functioning. 
These negative data far outweigh a few documented benefits for a limited set of medical indications, 
for which safe and effective alternative treatments are readily available. If there is any medical role for 
cannabinoid drugs, it lies with chemically defined compounds, not with unprocessed cannabis plant. 
Legalization or medical use of smoked cannabis is likely to impose significant public health risks, 
including an increased risk of schizophrenia, psychosis, and other forms of substance use disorders. 
(Svrakic et al. 2012)
The following statement is representative of the viewpoint that medical marijuana should be 
available:
Recent studies have shown that medical marijuana is effective in controlling chronic non-cancer pain, 
alleviating nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, treating wasting syndrome associated 
with AIDS, and controlling muscle spasms due to multiple sclerosis. These studies state that the alle-
viating benefits of marijuana outweigh the negative effects of the drug, and recommend that marijuana 
be administered to patients who have failed to respond to other therapies… After reviewing relevant 
scientific data and grounding the issue in ethical principles… there is a strong argument for allowing 
physicians to prescribe marijuana. Patients have a right to all beneficial treatments and to deny them 
this right violates their basic human rights. (Clark et al. 2011)
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• The medical use of cannabis as a suppository dates back to ancient Egypt (Russo 2003a). 
Today, chemical preparations of THC (hemisuccinates; THC itself is poorly absorbable 
rectally) are widely used in medical cannabis suppositories, providing good bioavailability

and sparing patients the problems associated with oral and pulmonary application (Walker 
et al. 1999). The subject is “the butt of puns,” including “the posterior is superior,” “back-
door medicine,” and “bend over, it’s time to get high.”
• In ancient China, priest-doctors used hemp stalks into which snake-like figures were 
carved as an aide to curing the sick. The sickbed was pounded with the stalks in an attempt 
to drive away the demons responsible for the sickness.
• A belief that has persisted to modern times in the Himalayan region is that if a cobra is 
killed and buried, and Cannabis seeds are grown on the site, they will yield extremely 
potent forms of marijuana, which can be used for medicinal purposes, especially to treat 
tuberculosis.
• Hempseed was commonly used in folk medicine in Europe. In some parts of Eastern 
Europe, doctors instructed patients whose gums and teeth were thought to be infested with 
worms to inhale hempseed fumes so that the parasites would become intoxicated and fall 
out (Benet 1975).
• On Saint John’s Eve in Europe, farmers would feed hemp flowers to their livestock in the 
belief that this protected the animals from evil and sickness.
• In the Balkans, an ancient folk ritual intended to cleanse people of diseases, and practiced 
until the early part of the twentieth century, was to run through a circle of burning hemp.
• In eighteenth century Britain, hempseed oil in milk was used to remedy venereal diseases.
• Free samples of medical Cannabis preparations were offered to visitors to the 1876 
American Centennial Exhibition in Washington, DC.
• Sir Richard Reynolds, personal physician of Queen Victoria (1819–1901), is widely claimed 
to have prescribed an alcoholic tincture of Cannabis to treat her severe menstrual cramps 
(a report that has been disputed).
• As noted by Benet (1975), in central Asia in the early twentieth century, marijuana oint-
ments were employed to alleviate the pain of wedding night defloration and “to shrink 
the vagina and prevent fluor alvus” (a disease caused by infection or inflammation of the 
genitals, commonly suffered by women). Male genitals also benefitted from comparable 
preparations of marijuana—in youth, to relieve the pain of circumcision and, in old age, 
as an aphrodisiac.
• Endocannabinoid is often abbreviated ECB. ECB is also a common abbreviation or acro-
nym for many names, most often “European Central Bank” (the central banker for coun-
tries in which the Euro is the standard currency). Among the more amusing meanings 
of ECB are “East Coast Bozoism” (“a syndrome that is seen in politics, economics, and 
business seen within DC and other eastern elite and power circles”) and the “England and 
Wales Cricket Board” (which explained that EWCB is too long, “because the public don’t 
identify with four initials as readily as with three”).
• “Cloninger type 1 alcoholics” are characterized by anxiety-prone temperaments and late 
onset of alcohol problems, while type 2 alcoholics (about 20% of alcoholics) are strongly 
influenced by heredity and exhibit teenage-onset heavy drinking and antisocial behav-
ior such as impulsive risk-taking and violent behavior. Based on brain postmortems, 
Lehtonen et al. (2010) found that anandamide levels in type 1 alcoholics were significantly 
low, but significantly high in the rarer type 2. These results suggest that most alcoholics 
might be better advised to use cannabis to compensate for anandamide deficiency rather 
than employing alcohol as their drug of choice. Curiously, in the early twentieth century, 
C. sativa was “used for the cure of chronic alcoholics in central Asia quite successfully” 
(Benet 1975). Russo (2011a) discussed the possibility that certain terpenes in marijuana 
can serve as short-term antidotes to alcohol intoxication.

14 Medical Marijuana: Production
THE NEED FOR HIGH STANDARDS OF PROFESSIONALISM
Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the world. It is relatively easy to cultivate plants 
outdoors, somewhat more difficult indoors. Most people can grow plants of reasonable but rarely 
outstanding quality in both circumstances. Professional horticulturalists, however, employ sophis-
ticated equipment and techniques to maximize yield, quality, and efficiency of production. Many 
illicit growers have in fact acquired a remarkable degree of skill and knowledge, and are in demand 
currently to oversee large commercial marijuana production enterprises that are being established, 
as shown in Figure 14.1. However, a very high degree of horticultural professionalism is now essen-
tial to compete in the legal marijuana production industry, and self-taught amateurs experienced in 
illicit clandestine techniques do not necessarily have the background that best suits a legal industry.
In particular, production of plants for consumable purposes, especially for medicinals, requires 
that the material be generated using “good agricultural practice” (GAP). GAP is variously defined 
but is generally understood to include responsible principles of cultivation, harvesting, and process-
ing that result in safe products while giving due consideration to social and economic conditions, as 
well as environmental sustainability. As reviewed in Chapter 12, illicitly produced street marijuana 
is frequently contaminated or adulterated, sometimes dangerously so. As reviewed in Chapter 16, 
illicitly produced street marijuana is typically produced with flagrant disregard for the safety of 
the environment. While the increasing legalization of cannabis offers those who have engaged in 
criminal generation of marijuana the opportunity to engage in legitimate production, the industry 
needs to engage personnel with high ethical standards.
FUNDAMENTALS OF MARIJUANA PLANT PRODUCTION
Overview Of PrOductiOn
Techniques for the generation of high-grade marijuana have now become more or less  standardized—
in governmental and authorized private sector production, as well as in the illicit trade. There are 
well over a hundred books that provide directions for the cultivation of marijuana plants and con-
sequent preparation of cannabis products. There is also an enormous “grey” literature (i.e., not like 
the kind of reputable documents produced by accepted authors and found in most libraries), much 
of it on the Internet. Despite the counter-culture nature of most such publications (really intended 
for the illicit trade) and the presence of some inaccurate and contradictory information, these 
sources are generally useful. Particularly competent or informative guides to aspects of marijuana 
cultivation include Clarke (1977, 1981), Drake (1979), Carver (1997), Frank (1997), Rosenthal et al. 
(1997), Rosenthal (1998), Green (2003), and Cervantes (2006, 2015). Note that a number of tech-
niques (described in Chapter 6) are employed by illicit growers to maximize productivity in very 
small grow rooms, but these methods are of limited usefulness in professional large-scale facili-
ties. A brief review of pertinent information on current production of marijuana follows.
Seedless marijuana is known in the illicit trade as “sinsemilla,” Spanish for seedless. Since 
seeds are virtually without tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and serve to adulterate or reduce the qual-
ity of the product, this generally means that seedless material is comparatively potent. Sinsemilla 
marijuana has become the standard form of intoxicating herbal cannabis. Female plants are culti-
vated in the absence of males, so they are protected against receiving pollen and do not develop 
seeds. As discussed in Chapter 11, males have lower levels of cannabinoids and are less productive 
than females. More importantly, because seeds are virtually devoid of cannabinoids, their presence 

352
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
substantially dilutes the female plant’s production of cannabinoids, the chief desired chemicals. As 
noted in Chapter 4, sex expression is variable in Cannabis sativa, and it is necessary to check plants 
to ensure that some male flowers do not develop.
For the most part, once desirable female plants have been identified, they are reproduced 
asexually, yielding identical (i.e., cloned) individuals. The use of cloned plants contributes to the 
production of a uniform and predictable grade of marijuana. Branch cuttings (with a meristem, 
i.e., a growing point) are harvested, rooted, and grown to a desirable size and then are induced 
to flower by increasing the dark period of the 24-hour daily cycle. (As noted in Chapter 5, most 
strains of C. sativa are composed of short-day plants, photoperiodically adjusted to initiate flow-
ers in the late summer and early autumn when day length shortens. As also noted, daily exposure 
to 13–14 hours of darkness causes most marijuana strains to come into flower.) In the absence of 
male plants producing pollen that normally fertilizes the female flowers, resulting in the produc-
tion of seeds, the flowering branches continue to abundantly develop female flowers, each with 
a perigonal bract covered by secretory glands producing cannabinoids. The flowering branches 
become strongly covered with flowers (at which point the congested terminal branch systems are 
known in the illicit trade as “bud”). While much of the plant could be collected to produce mari-
juana, increasingly only the buds are collected for marijuana (although much of the above-ground 
plant is also used to extract cannabinoids).
Harvest time is based on judgment of when a maximum concentration of THC has developed. 
The secretory glands mature as the flowers mature, overmature glands tending to have decreased 
levels of THC. In the illicit cannabis drug trade, it is well known that marijuana plants need to be 
harvested when many of the glands are mature (which occurs when many of the flowers are mature) 
but while there are not too many overmature glands present. Some growers will harvest the ter-
minal inflorescence first, since it matures relatively quickly, and allow the slower maturing lower 
FIGURE 14.1 One of the growth facilities of GW Pharmaceuticals (U.K.), using a combination of natural 
and artificial lighting. Reproduced with permission of GW Pharmaceuticals plc.
 

353
Medical Marijuana: Production
flowering portions more time to develop (usually about an extra week). Should the ideal harvest 
period be exceeded, more material will be generated (because of plant growth), but that material 
will be lower in THC because of gland deterioration.
After harvest, plants are dried for several days, typically in a separate room. The buds may be 
individually picked and the larger leaves trimmed away with scissors (a labor-intensive procedure 
providing considerable employment; trimmings are frequently kept as raw material for extracts). 
Subsequently, the buds can be pulverized or screened, although intact trimmed buds usually fetch 
a premium price. The flowering material from the dried plants can simply be stripped off, followed 
by pulverizing. The final product is placed in packages of standard weight, or ground material can 
be made into cigarettes.
Large-scale greenhouse operations for ornamental, edible, and medicinal crops are normally 
automated to reduce labor and ensure strict control of schedules and environmental variables. This 
includes automatic implementation of regimes for lighting, ventilation, and fertigation (combining 
irrigation and liquid-soluble fertilization). A simplified plan showing essential rooms required for a 
professional marijuana production facility is shown in Figure 14.2.
As with all commercial endeavors in which several factors contribute to the final product, maxi-
mum profits are achieved by a compromise of inputs. Marijuana production efficiency primarily 
depends on an economic combination of light intensity, planting density, and strain of marijuana.
Planting density and yields
Whether indoors or outdoors, density of planting affects yield of marijuana harvestable from a given 
plant or from a given area. The best planting density for a given strain needs to be determined by 
trial and error, but the information presented in the following provides general guidelines. In most 
circumstances, the area available to growers is limited, and yield per unit area is of far greater 
importance than the amount of material harvested from a given plant. Yield is best expressed in 
terms of usable dried marijuana produced per unit area; in practice, the “dry weight” (air-dry weight) 
of marijuana can range from 10% to 15% of “fresh” or “green” weight.
Indoor Yields
For competitive reasons, commercial producers of marijuana usually do not reveal yield data. 
Vanhove et al. (2011) found that yield/m2 did not differ between densities of 16 plants/m2 and

20 plants m2 (of course, the lower density produced larger plants). Toonen et al. (2006) surveyed 
yield of illicitly grown indoor sinsemilla (seedless) C. sativa in the Netherlands and found that 
based on a mean plant density of 15/m2 and an illumination of 510 watts/m2, the mean yield for 
a single harvest of buds was 33.7 g/plant or 505 g/m2. Toonen et al. (2006) noted that four to six 
indoor harvests per year are possible, and the THC level of buds was about 15%. They recommended 
a density of 32 plants/m2 for optimal yield. Also based on the Netherlands indoor plants, Leggett 
(2006) suggested average relative ratios of wet, dry, and bud material of 10:3:1 (i.e., wet weight of 
plant:dry weight of plant:dry weight of harvested buds). Bedrocan, the sole authorized supplier of 
medical marijuana to the Netherlands government since 2001, reported an average yield of 315 g/m2 
for their strain Bedrocan and 251 g/m2 for their strain Bedica, employing a plant density of 2.33 per 
m2 and a light intensity of 423 W/m2 (Vanhove et al. 2011). Bedrocan’s Bedrocan strain is a sativa 
type variety, while their strain Bedica is an indica type, the former longer-flowering, contributing 
to the higher production. The yield figures in Caulkins et al. (2012) and Hawken and Prieger (2013) 
vary from 325 to 430 g/m2/harvest.
In summary, the literature indicates that yields usually range from about 250 to about 500 g/m2/
harvest, with about four harvests expected annually.
Outdoor Yields
Leggett (2006) suggests a representative figure of 100 g/m2 (or 1 tonne/ha) for yield of outdoor crops, 
although five times as much is possible. In most temperate region locations, only one crop can be 
produced during the year, but two or three are possible in subtropical and tropical areas. (The length 
of the daily dark period is a major obstacle to growing most strains of marijuana outdoors near the 
equator. At the equator, the dark and light periods are about 12 hours long, but this very short dark 
period normally induces marijuana strains to flower, so near the equator, most strains would flower 
prematurely. Only day-neutral strains would be suitable [see Chapter 5].) Because several indoor crops 
can be grown in a year, and productivity can be manipulated by various techniques, indoor production 
can be 15–30 times as much as outdoor production for a given area (Leggett 2006). Nevertheless, as 
for most annual crops, outdoor cultivation is much more economical when expressed on a cost/gram 
basis, although for security and quality control of production, indoor cultivation is usually necessary 
for licensed marijuana production in most countries. Compared to most major field crops, a relatively 
small outdoor area is needed to satisfy the needs of a large consumer population (Small 1971).
gOvernmental PrOductiOn QuOtas
Most growers of marijuana benefit from high efficiency of production. (In some jurisdictions, pri-
vate citizens are allowed to grow a small number of plants, in which case efficiency of production is 
not much of a concern.) Illicit growers of cannabis particularly need to maximize yield from a given 
area because the larger the area utilized, the greater the chance of detection. Authorized commer-
cial growers of cannabis also need to maximize yield from a given area because governments often 
limit the area that may be used to cultivate plants. For commercial growers, higher production per 
unit area may have some detrimental aspects that lower profits. High plant densities can be condu-
cive to pests and diseases and make handling (tying branches to supports, trimming away damaged 
branches, harvesting) difficult. Constructing very small walkways between benches allows more 
space for plants but less for handlers. Sometimes, misguided policies have authorized private sec-
tor growers to produce only a limited number of plants (e.g., 100), in which case they have often 
been carefully nurtured to develop into giants so that each individual would produce as much as 
100 typical indoor marijuana plants. This can be achieved by manipulating the photoperiod to keep 
the plants vegetative and allowing them to grow for long periods under luxuriant conditions. When 
jurisdictions limit grower production by quotas, factors contributing to yield need to be specified. 
A professional marijuana production facility necessarily requires space for noncultivation facili-
ties (washrooms, record rooms, storage, etc.) and space that directly supports cultivation (power, 
 

355
Medical Marijuana: Production
heating, etc.) and processing (drying, manicuring, packaging, etc.). Moreover, “growing space” can 
include areas dedicated to establishing seedlings or cuttings, areas for vegetative growth, and areas 
for flowering plants (Figure 14.2). Since the last-mentioned is the key stage of production, a sensible 
quota system could be based exclusively or mainly on the area in which plants are in flower.
grOwth media
All of the techniques presently used to grow horticultural plants in commercial greenhouses can be 
employed to grow marijuana plants. These include hydroponics (roots growing in water but supported 
by an inert medium) and aeroponics (exposed roots growing in air are misted with nutrient solu-
tion), both typically conducted in large tanks housing numerous plants. The use of so-called “soilless” 
media, both inorganic (such as gravel or rockwool) and organic (such as coir, i.e., coconut husk), effec-
tively represents hydroponic culture, even if the plants are placed in individual pots, since all nutrients 
are added in solution. The appropriate pH for nutrient solutions employed for hydroponic cultivation 
is lower (typically 5.2–5.8) than is optimum for culture in soil (6.5–7.2). A mystique about the alleged 
superiority of hydroponic growth of marijuana has developed. However, hydroponic production of 
marijuana does not appear to be notably advantageous over conventional soil-based methodology, and 
most growers do not employ purely water-based production systems. “Such systems do not appear to 
increase cannabis productivity or potency” (Potter 2014) and require considerable cultivator knowl-
edge and experience. A possible advantage is that hydroponic growth can lessen the possibilities of 
microbiological and chemical contamination that sometimes comes from soil cultivation, but these 
potential problems always require diligence, whatever cultivation techniques are employed.
Traditional culture in pots of soil can produce entirely satisfactory results and is the principal 
method employed. Indoor plants are grown in pots of compost and soil (sometimes referred to as 
“organic,” although this hardly defines organic agriculture as it is usually understood). Most profes-
sional marijuana growers prepare their own soil mixes or purchase commercial preparations. Peat-
based mixes are commonly employed because of their water-retentive capacity, but lime is often 
added to reduce the natural acidity of peat. Sterilization of growth media prior to planting is highly 
advisable to reduce disease. Professional growers add mineral nutrients on a need basis, based on 
soil analysis. Whatever type of pot culture is adopted, horticulturalists often “flush” accumulated 
salts and minerals away with running water, typically after a substantial number of chemical nutri-
ent fertilizations, often in the last two weeks prior to harvest.
Fertilizer mixtures alleged to be formulated specifically for marijuana plants are sometimes avail-
able commercially. “Growth boosters” (often plant growth hormones, sometimes preparations alleged 
to enhance root health) are also sometimes available, but the phrase “caveat emptor” should be remem-
bered. Fertilizers based wholly or in part on animals (manure, bone meal, and blood) may harbor 
pathogenic bacteria, and although the risk is low, production of medicinal products requires extreme 
care. “Aquaponics” combines conventional “aquaculture” (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, 
crayfish, or prawns in tanks), taking advantage of the animal excretions to fertilize  the plants. Because 
the excreta could be toxic, production of marijuana by such system would require study of safety 
aspects, although vegetables are often aquaponically grown. As discussed later, medical marijuana 
production is usually required to meet health standards of good agricultural practices and good manu-
facturing practices.
vegetative PrOPagatiOn
Once elite female plants are obtained or selected, they are maintained indefinitely by keeping them 
in a vegetative state (typically at 18 hours of light daily), although as discussed in Chapter 5, some 
strains are completely or partly insensitive to photoperiodic regime and will flower regardless of the 
grower’s wishes. Occasionally, some female plants will prove to have a tendency to produce some 
male flowers, and these should be removed (although such unique plants are useful for breeding).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The art of reproducing horticultural plants by cuttings is well established, but different species 
tend to have somewhat different requirements. Numerous guides provide protocols for propagating 
C. sativa by cuttings (e.g., Chandra et al. 2010b; Upton et al. 2013). Vigorous “mother plants” (some-
times “motherplants”) are employed as the starting material, and cuttings are harvested serially as 
needed. Mother plants can be maintained in the vegetative state for 20 or more years (Clarke and 
Watson 2006). However, new mother plants are usually established every few months from cut-
tings, as the old ones gradually deteriorate from all the cuttings taken (or sometimes from diseases 
that infect the cut stems). Typically, a short branch with two or three leaves is cut off, at a 45° angle 
below a node (a joint on the stem where a leaf or leaves arise) (a sterile blade is recommended), and 
about 2 cm of the base is dipped in a rooting hormone (such as indole-3-butryic acid). The cuttings 
may be grown in coco fiber, perlite, rock wool, sand, vermiculite, or some other rooting medium 
or mix (preferably sterile or sterilized), in small individual peat pots or large collective trays. They 
are placed so that at least one node at the base of the cutting is in the rooting medium. Plants are 
irrigated so that the rooting medium remains moist (hydroponic culture is alternatively practiced). 
The environment is kept moist (ca. 50% humidity), warm (ca. 25°C), and under diffused light. A 
small plastic tent is often fashioned over cuttings to maintain a desired humidity. Adequate rooting 
typically occurs in two to three weeks, and several weeks later, the young plants are placed in larger 
pots and transferred to a growth room or greenhouse.
Advanced biotechnological techniques have been employed to mass propagate excised apical 
meristems rather than whole cuttings (Wang et al. 2009; Upton et al. 2013) and even to encapsulate 
these as “synthetic seeds” for field planting (Chandra et al. 2010b; also see Chapter 4).
lighting
Light is the most critical requirement for plant growth (for a review of the physiological roles that 
light plays, see Chen et al. 2004). Different kinds of lights have been employed for indoor produc-
tion of marijuana. The advantages and disadvantages of the most popular kinds of lighting are 
examined in this section. The efficiency that different lamps convert electricity to light is a criti-
cal cost consideration. Large illicit grow-ops often steal electricity (Chapter 16) because it is so 
expensive and to avoid detection by the police, who often look for abnormally large consumption 
in residential areas.
Light Intensity
Cannabis sativa is naturally adapted to grow in full sunlight, and increasing light intensity strongly 
promotes photosynthesis and growth (Lydon et al. 1987; Chandra et al. 2008). Most marijuana strains 
originate from latitudes south of north latitude 40°N (indeed, generally south of 30°N) and so are 
adapted to very high light intensities. Chandra et al. (2010a) found that clonally propagated plants pro-
duced higher THC levels outdoors in Mississippi than the corresponding genetically identical (cloned) 
indoor plants and attributed this to the light intensity outdoors—slightly more than twice as intensive 
as the indoor situation. Light intensity in indoor facilities is normally the key factor limiting productiv-
ity. To increase lighting intensity, artificial light sources can be positioned close to the canopy of grow-
ing plants. However, because of the heat produced by most lighting systems, they cannot be placed too 
closely, although air-cooled high-intensity lamps can be placed relatively close to the plants.
For security reasons, indoor production of marijuana is often carried out using only artificial light 
(Figure 14.3). Potter (2014) described the production system (in England) of GW Pharmaceuticals, 
using a greenhouse system with supplemental illumination providing approximately half the light 
energy required during the year (Figure 14.1). This employed lighting supplying 55 W/m2, which is 
well above levels in U.K. glasshouses producing food or ornamental crops.
The “strength” of light can be measured in various ways. “Light intensity” (measured in Lux or 
Lumens) is a total measure of solar radiation, but less than half of this includes photosynthetically 
active radiation (between wavelengths 400 and 700 nm). From the perspective of plant photosynthesis, 
 

357
Medical Marijuana: Production
light is best measured as photon flux density, a measure of light energy (in moles) received per unit 
of time per unit of area. Chandra et al. (2008) reported that C. sativa benefits from light up to a pho-
ton flux density of 1500 μmol/m2/s. For practical reasons, however, yield data (discussed later) are 
often presented in terms of weight produced/watts utilized, since lamps are measured in wattage, and 
expressing the weight of marijuana produced in relation to wattage is a direct measure of cost/unit.
Cannabis plants can tolerate much more light intensity than humans can, and so while the plants 
will grow better under extremely high interior lighting, workers can find the lights too bright for 
comfort. In any event, after moderately high lighting is provided, progressive increases of light 
intensity produce diminishing increases of growth.
A productivity of 1 g of marijuana output per watt of light input is often considered to be a 
desirable level of efficiency. Interior lighting regimes for cannabis grow rooms in the Netherlands 
commonly utilize 270 to 600 W/m2, and over this range, Potter and Duncombe (2012) observed the 
following: (1) THC level does not change significantly, (2) weight and proportion of flowering mate-
rial (hence production of sinsemilla buds) increase by about one-quarter, and (3) efficiency (yield/
area) decreases by about four-fifths.
Vanhove et al. (2011) stated that “Overhead lights should provide at least 54,000 lumens per m2. 
Nowadays, these light intensities are amply achieved by high-pressure sodium or metal halide lamps 
of either 400 W or 600 W.” One lamp can be positioned over the center of each square meter. 
Vanhove et al. (2012) noted that 600-W bulbs were the most popular choice of illicit growers in 
Belgium (although commercial growers may choose to use larger lights).
Light Quality
As noted in the following discussion, high-pressure sodium and metal halide are popular choices for 
growing marijuana, although the former is somewhat deficient in the blue end of the spectrum.

cal marijuana to the Netherlands government since 2001. This growth room employs only artificial light.

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The blue portion of the photosynthetic spectrum has been observed to tend to suppress growth 
elongation of some marijuana strains, so that a choice of a lamp rich in blue could promote shorter 
plants with more compact buds. Potter and Duncombe (2012) found that ultraviolet light increased 
THC concentration, but insufficiently to warrant attention.
Fluorescent Lighting
Fluorescent light bulbs furnish light efficiently in terms of converting electricity to light energy, but 
conventional bulbs emit limited light so it is difficult to provide the high light intensity that benefits the 
growth of C. sativa. Full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs provide balanced red and blue light to promote 
photosynthesis and are preferable to cool-white bulbs. Fluorescents are often used for establishing 
cuttings and germinating seeds because they generate sufficient light for growth while producing little 
heat (ballasts, which do produce heat, can be located some distance away from the plants). Compact 
fluorescent bulbs (with self-contained ballasts) are often used for growing marijuana illicitly in small 
rooms because they produce relatively little heat and use relatively little electricity.
High-Pressure Sodium Lighting
High-pressure sodium lighting (HPS) produces light efficiently, and the bulbs tend to last twice as 
long as metal halides. The ballasts produce considerable heat, and cooling may be necessary. Recent 
marijuana cultivation guides commonly recommend a light regime of 600 W/m2 using HPS. The 
height of the lights above the tops of the plant canopy needs to be kept constant (30–60 cm has been 
recommended) by raising the lights as the plants grow (otherwise, the highest part of the plants will 
be scorched). Higher wattage (such as 1000 W) bulbs require a meter or more distance from the 
top of the plants. The color spectrum of HPS is somewhat stronger in the orange/red portion of the 
spectrum, somewhat deficient at the blue end, and therefore better for vegetative growth than for 
the flowering phase, but this is rarely considered important.
Metal Halide Lighting
Metal halide lamps produce less quality light (balance of wavelengths required for photosynthesis) 
and tend to fade faster over long periods than high HPS does (metal halide lamps are typically use-
ful for up to 10,000 hours, HPS, for up to 18,000 hours).
Light-Emitting Diode Lighting
Light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, compared to high-intensity discharge lamps, are longer lasting 
(lifetimes can exceed 100,000 hours), smaller, adjustable for light intensity (dimmable) and quality, 
and extremely efficient in converting electricity to light (Yeh and Chung 2009). LEDs can produce 
three times more light output per watt of input power on an area-equivalent basis compared to 
high-intensity discharge lamps (Morrow 2008). LEDs have a low surface temperature, so they can 
even be placed inside a crop canopy without injuring the plants. While LEDs produce light with 
drastically reduced power consumption and heat generation, they are expensive to purchase. Until 
recently, it has been difficult to achieve the high intensity needed for good growth of marijuana, 
and the technology has not been practical for commercial production. Most LED lighting currently 
available is unsuitable for growing marijuana indoors, but LED lighting has prospects of capturing 
an appreciable share of the market in the near future.
Recommended Lighting
By a considerable margin, high-pressure sodium and metal halide are the most popular choices for 
growing C. sativa under artificial light, and they are sometimes combined to promote color balance 
(Figure 14.4). Both are classified as “high-intensity discharge” lamps.

temPerature
Marijuana strains are generally adapted to grow well at quite warm temperatures, generally at 
least 25°C, often performing best under daylight temperatures of about 30°C. Required lighting 
elevates temperatures in indoor growth facilities. Higher temperatures produce better growth for 
many strains but are uncomfortable for workers and may encourage the growth of insects and spider 
mites. Because cooling is expensive, in practice growth facilities are kept fairly warm.
atmOsPheric grOwth cOnditiOns
Humidity
Outdoors, C. sativa tolerates a range of humidity, depending on strain. Cuttings are generally raised 
under elevated humidity (about 75%) since their developing root systems are too weak to absorb 
much water. Until cuttings are well rooted, growers often mist their foliage with a water spray. 
Grow rooms and greenhouses easily develop very high levels of humidity, and if prolonged, this 
encourages fungal infection. Air exchange is essential to maintain moderate humidity—about 50% 
to 60%. Fans are employed to promote uniform conditions, with the additional benefit that wind 
buffeting promotes stronger (and sometimes shorter) stems.

Air-Borne Contaminants in Relation to Stickiness
Marijuana plants often develop stickiness on the surface of the flowering parts. Probably some strains 
differ in their tendency to produce stickiness. Stickiness is due to terpene secretions from the gland 
heads of the stalked trichomes that are present (as described in Chapter 11). There is limited secretion 
from intact gland heads, but buffeting by wind, ventilation, or handling releases some resin. In very 
windy, dry, or cold environments, secretions tend to volatilize more readily, decreasing stickiness; 
by contrast, in hot, still environments (whether outdoors or under intense grow-lights), secretions 
appear to accumulate more readily, and the plant surfaces can become very sticky. The degree of 
stickiness depends in part on the atmospheric conditions provided—whether grown outdoors, in 
glass houses, or in growth chambers. There are potential problems associated with the degree of 
stickiness developed. Plants grown outdoors are particularly subjected to wind-borne particles (from 
soil, animals, etc.) and insects, which represent contaminants. Quite aside from the natural stickiness 
of the plants, some contaminants such as insect and bird excreta are themselves sticky and adhere 
tightly to the plants. Depending on ventilation system, glass house plants are generally subjected to 
a lower shower of contaminants, and plants in small chambers are usually susceptible to the lowest 
amount. It can be virtually impossible to separate tiny particles adhering to harvested buds, and 
stickiness also makes handling of ground-up material difficult. Care needs to be taken to minimize 
the presence of wind-borne materials. Filtering of circulated air is clearly desirable, as well as moni-
toring of the effects of temperature and humidity on the development of stickiness.
Carbon Dioxide Concentration
Like most plants, growth rate in C. sativa is increased by elevating CO2 levels (Chandra et al. 2011a). 
Some growers employ CO2 generators, fueled by natural gas or propane, to raise indoor CO2 levels 
and accelerate plant productivity. Concentrations of CO2 are often raised to four times natural levels 
(ca. 1600 ppm). As noted in Chapter 16, although releasing CO2 might seem to contribute to atmo-
spheric pollution, the speeding up of plant growth (and therefore the trapping of carbon within the 
plants) might, on balance, be beneficial for the environment.
insect cOntrOl
It should be possible to produce marijuana plants organically, without employing any biocides 
(including fungicides), although some greenhouse pests, such as aphids, spider mites (Figure 14.5), 
thrips, and whiteflies are difficult to control. Biocontrol measures using beneficial insects and other 
FIGURE 14.5 Left: Damage to indoor-grown plant of C. sativa caused by the twospotted spider mite

invertebrate predators (such as nematodes and predatory mites) that consume or parasitize invaders, 
and some organic insecticides, are preferable to employing synthetic pesticides. Applications need 
to be completed well in advance of harvest to prevent contamination.
harvest and drying
Plants are harvested when it is judged that maximum cannabinoids have developed. This stage 
can be assessed by chemical analysis or more frequently is estimated as the point that numerous 
female flowers have developed and the stigmas of an appreciable proportion (at least 75%) of them 
have recently turned from white to brownish or orange. Outdoor plants are best harvested during a 
rainless period, so that the plants aren’t soaked, but timing depends on Mother Nature. Plants are 
traditionally cut off at the base of the main stalk, just below the lowest branch. Different options are 
available for drying plants, but commonly, they are simply hung on cord (Figure 14.6). Curiously, 
the modern Chinese character ma, 麻, is based on a Zhou Dynasty bronze script ideograph for can-
nabis or hemp, showing 林 (plants) drying in a 广 (shed).
There is widespread opinion that slow drying or “curing” (up to a week) of harvested plants in a 
moderately dry, well-ventilated (and/or dehumidified), dark environment maintained at 25°C–30°C 
produces the best marijuana. However, some production systems conduct drying at up to 40°C for 
only 15 hours (Upton et al. 2013). An industrial grade ventilation system is normally required for 
large-scale production. At the conclusion of drying, the foliage should be crisp and brittle enough 
to be crumbled and the floral material should pull away readily from the stems. Fresh plants may 
have a moisture content of about 80%, which may dry down to about 15%. If material is to be stored 
before processing, it should be in an area maintained at low humidity, cool temperature, and in 
darkness. Marijuana should be dried to 5%–10% before packaging (8% has been recommended, 
although some consumers prefer a “wetter” product).
Alternative to harvesting entire plants, they may be kept growing while harvesting individual 
buds or portions of branches as they mature (rather like harvesting tomatoes from a given plant as it 
sequentially matures the fruit). The uppermost part of the main stalk usually matures first. (Home 
growers and sometimes commercial growers sometimes prune away lower branches in the expecta-
tion that this will produce larger terminal inflorescences.)

University (CC BY SA 3.0).

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
PrOcessing
Once dried, the foliage and floral material is stripped from the stem tissues (stalk and twigs). The 
stems are routinely discarded since they are almost devoid of cannabinoids. For chemical extraction 
of cannabinoids, all of the remaining material can be employed. For production of ground-up (mani-
cured) marijuana, the floral and other tissues in the flowering stem (mostly the perigonal bracts and 
smallest leaves) are screened. Loose gland heads tend to fall off and accumulate in the collection 
container, and since these are very concentrated in cannabinoids, a protocol needs to be established 
to maintain both herbal parts and the gland heads in a standard fashion in the final product.
Buds are increasingly desired in the marketplace and are often processed by hand (either trimmed 
or crumbled), a rather labor-intensive process (Figure 14.7). For sales presentation, the smallest leaves 
(with lesser levels of cannabinoids) are often trimmed away from the buds with scissors or machines. 
Machine trimming is much faster but less complete than hand trimming and is often employed as a 
first step followed by a final hand processing. The principal purpose of this practice is to present a 
product along with a claim that it has a very high level of cannabinoids, especially THC. Such trim-
ming is best done before the buds are well dried, as the cannabinoid-rich trichomes tend to drop away 
with handling because well-dried buds are brittle. The “trim” or “skuff” (material removed from the 
buds) is sometimes discarded, but efficient systems can use this for solvent extraction of cannabinoids.
stOrage
Since oxygen and light degrade THC, to retain quality, the marijuana should be protected from air (in 
tightly sealed containers) and maintained in the dark. Recommended storage temperatures are as fol-
lows: short-term, 18°C–20°C, and long-term, −20°C (Upton et al. 2013). Handling should be kept to a 
minimum, since the trichome gland heads containing the cannabinoids are easily separated when mari-
juana is dried and brittle. While material is frozen, it is especially prone to dropping the gland heads.
QUALITY CONTROL
Aside from the argument that marijuana is inherently harmful, medical marijuana needs to be pro-
duced with considerable quality control, adhering to general Good Manufacturing Procedures and 
Best Practices.

micrObiOlOgical safety and sterilizatiOn
Plant material typically carries microorganisms on the surface. Illicit cannabis drugs may be sig-
nificantly contaminated microbiologically, for example, as a result of using human excrement as 
fertilizer or simply from handling material with unwashed hands. Salmonella has occasionally been 
detected. Verweij et al. (2000) examined many samples of marijuana and found that they were heav-
ily contaminated by fungal spores. The fungus genus Aspergillus occurs worldwide in water, soil, 
and air and can cause infection when its conidia (asexual spores) are inhaled. Sufficient heat can 
destroy the spores, but smoking often does not provide enough heat. Smoking marijuana contami-
nated with Aspergillus fungi and other microorganisms can cause significant, even fatal, lung dis-
eases in patients with weakened health (Chusid et al. 1975; Llamas et al. 1978; Kagen 1981; Kagen 
et al. 1983; Karup et al. 1983; Schwartz 1985; Sutton et al. 1986; Hamadeh et al. 1988; Denning et al. 
1991; Levitz and Diamond 1991; Marks et al. 1996; Szyper-Kravitz et al. 2001; Cescon et al. 2008; 
Gargani et al. 2011). Given that patients are often immunocompromised, certified medical cannabis 
needs to adhere to high production standards.
In Canada, the Netherlands, and other jurisdictions, officially produced medical marijuana con-
forms to very strict quality standards and is gamma-irradiated to sterilize coliform microbial infec-
tion (Cannabis Health 2005). According to Russo (2011a), “the safety of this technique for a smoked 
and inhaled product has never been specifically tested” (and as noted in Chapter 9, irradiation 
eliminates terpenes with possible medicinal value). Ruchlemer et al. (2015) explored sterilization 
of medical marijuana by autoclave, plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and ethylene oxide gas as 
alternatives, since nuclear facilities to irradiate marijuana are rarely available. They recommended 
H2O2 plasma, which has become a commonly used germicidal method.
mOnitOring and cOntrOlling the PrOductiOn Of standardized herbal marijuana
Aside from microbiological safety, a professional medicinal marijuana analytical laboratory will 
be equipped to check representative samples for cannabinoid content, moisture level, and the 
presence of toxins of nonbiological origin such as heavy metals and pesticides. Marijuana can 
be contaminated with pesticide residues, heavy metals (absorbed from the soil or from waste-
water used for irrigation), or by the occasional deliberate adulteration with (other) illicit drugs 
(McPartland 1994, 2002; McPartland and Pruitt 1997; McPartland et al. 2000). The underground 
literature sometimes describes the use of toxic growth-enhancing chemicals, and these may con-
taminate street marijuana. As pointed out by Sullivan et al. (2013), “pesticide toxicity…can pose 
substantial threats to immunocompromised patients or patients with other conditions, such as dis-
eases of the liver, that may intensify the toxicological effects of pesticide exposure. Additionally, 
during heating pyrolysis products from the plant material form a highly complex mixture of 
products, many of which may interact with the pesticides or pyrolysis products of the pesticides 
forming more toxic materials, or highly toxic pyrolysis products may form from the pesticide 
residues alone.” See Chapter 12 for additional discussion of toxic compounds potentially associ-
ated with marijuana.
Both for authorized medicinal research and for licensed dispensation of medicinal mari-
juana, it is critical to supply material of standardized and uniform THC and CBD content. Many 
patients using medical marijuana are in fact experienced users, who will judge the acceptability 
of the product in part on the basis on what they have consumed in the past. For such sophis-
ticated users, familiar appearance and organoleptic qualities can be important indicators of 
product acceptability. Qualities valued by marijuana users include overall appearance, color, 
smell, humidity, grind size, and smoking characteristics such as burn rate, hotness, harshness, 
and taste (Ware et al. 2006). Accordingly, laboratory technicians may be expected to judge 
appearance and odor of the product, at least for consistency, since these qualities differ among 
strains.
 

364
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Medical marijuana is mostly provided today in the form of whole (buds) or granulated (finely 
ground) material. The THC level of the final product is determined by (1) the natural genetic capac-
ity to produce THC of the plants employed; (2) the environment in which the plants were raised; 
(3) the environment in which the plants were harvested, dried, and stored; and (4) the exact parts of 
the plant sampled. All of these variables need to be standardized and controlled. Medical marijuana 
currently marketed under license by authorized sources typically contains 10%–30% THC, the 
higher levels often considered to be a chief selling point.
Medical marijuana may be provided in the form of “manicured” material, prepared from dried 
“bud” by crumbling, screening, and/or cutting. The manicuring process needs to be standardized 
and controlled. Critical variables that need to be considered include the following:
 
1. Drying technique and humidity during manicuring. Overly dried material and/or material 
that is manicured in a very dry environment, upon crumbling and/or screening, tends to 
result in the microscopic glands (that contain the THC) breaking away from the remaining 
herbal material, and depending on the collection procedure, these may not be present in the 
final product. The results may be lowered THC content or marijuana with a variable THC 
content.
 
2. Screen (pore) size. Smaller screen size filters out larger parts, particularly twig material, 
which is very low in THC and results in a higher THC content of the final product.
 
3. Force applied during crumbling and or screening. A larger force hastens production but 
(depending particularly on how dry the plants are, and the ambient humidity) may tend to 
break away the microscopic glands and smear the contained resin over other parts of the 
herbal mixture, which, after screening, may alter THC content.
 
4. Handling of the product, which needs to be minimized. In (dried, prepared) marijuana, 
a proportion of the secretory glands (which carry most of the THC) separate from 
the epidermis of the plant material, and with increased handling, a larger percent-
age of the glands separate. This can result in considerable heterogeneity of marijuana 
preparations, the glands tending to sift to the bottom of collected material. Also, such 
variability can make it difficult to produce authorized material of homogeneous THC 
composition.
Unfortunately, even when marijuana is generated using genetically uniform plant material (i.e., 
clones), because of variations in plant growth conditions, preparation of material, and storage, dif-
ferences in THC content develop. By standardizing (insofar as possible) plant growth conditions, 
preparation of material, and storage, material with a relatively predictable THC content can be gen-
erated, but nevertheless, from time to time, material of lower than desired THC content might be 
produced, requiring adjustment of THC content by mixing of batches of known potency.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Compared to almost all other crops, relatively little marijuana needs to be generated for authorized 
purposes (Small 1971), but because it is a high-value material in considerable demand, strong secu-
rity is essential (Figure 14.8). Cannabis has very high value, and stolen material has considerable

abuse and harm potential. Marijuana continues to be a favorite trade commodity of criminals, who 
can be quite ruthless in robbing, intimidating, and even eliminating legitimate competition. The 
authorized marijuana business can be lucrative, and the wealth generated also invites unwelcome 
attention from the criminal element. At present, production of medicinal marijuana by the private 
sector occurs mostly in indoor facilities that are very well protected by guards, locked doors, and 
monitoring cameras. Storage is in very heavy vaults, and elaborate protocols are in place to pre-
vent unauthorized access. Most of the cost of marijuana is due directly to the needs for security. 
Governments that authorize the production of medicinal marijuana are very insistent on adequate 
security, and breaches of requirements are not tolerated. The website of the Canadian government, 
cited previously, is particularly informative on security measures.
BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPROACHES OF POTENTIAL 
IMPORTANCE TO MEDICINAL MARIJUANA
in vitrO PrOductiOn
Techniques for the “test tube” culture of plant cells, tissues, organs, and young plants in aseptic arti-
ficial media have been developing since the 1940s. Termed “micropropagation,” this is essentially a 
form of clonal reproduction and can be a means of producing a large number of genetically identical 
plants in a short time. As a breeding technique, it is invaluable for preserving mutations, especially 
those that are (genetically) recessive. The responses of plant cells and tissues to various artificial 
culture media and hormone treatments (required to induce cell differentiation, organ production, 
and plantlet production) differ considerably among plant species. Some species have proven to be 
very difficult to reproduce by tissue culture, and until recently, this has included C. sativa (Hemphill 
et al. 1978; Loh et al. 1983; Mandolino et al. 1996; Mandolino and Ranalli 1998). As described in 
Chapter 4, it is now possible to produce “artificial seeds” of C. sativa: very young plantlets packaged 
with fertilizer and water in a gel, which can be planted just like real seeds to produce new plants.
The most elementary kind of test tube culture is simple cell culture. In some cases, plant cell cul-
tures are sufficient for the commercial production of certain chemicals. However, a frequent problem 
FIGURE 14.8 High security required for marijuana. Prepared by B. Brookes.
 

367
Medical Marijuana: Production
encountered is that the production of compounds that occur in the mature plants of a species sim-
ply do not occur or occur in very low amounts when the cells are cultured. This has proven to 
be the case in Cannabis. Veliky and Genest (1972) found no production of THC in cell cultures. 
There have been some experiments that demonstrated production of cannabinoids in cell cultures 
of Cannabis, but in extremely limited amounts (Heitrich and Binder 1982; Hartsel et al. 1983; 
see review of Mandolino and Ranalli 1998). There remains a reasonable potential of utilizing in 
vitro production techniques for the test tube production of cannabinoids, although the technology 
remains to be developed.
genetic engineering
Techniques for introducing genes from quite unrelated organisms into given species have been 
developing since the 1980s. There have been remarkable successes in creating several new kinds 
of recombinants, and some are in commercial production today, although genetically engineered 
organisms are controversial. There appears to be a widespread sentiment against the production 
of genetically engineered hemp strains among growers of industrial hemp (particularly for the 
hemp edible oilseed industry, there is a strong view that the plants should remain “natural”). 
Nevertheless, it is interesting to speculate on some possibilities (cf. Watson and Clarke 1997). 
The production of natural cannabinoids in large amounts is at present known only in C. sativa, 
where it occurs almost completely in the epidermal secretory glands of the plant. Perhaps genetic 
engineering could one day succeed in transferring the ability to produce cannabinoids to other 
plants. This might seem like an academic exercise, but for various reasons, such interspecies 
transfers are often preferable (Small 2004). An important practical aspect of genetic engineering 
is the clarification of the genes of a plant under study, and this can lead to manipulation of the 
genome so that the plant becomes more useful. Modern techniques have made it possible to pre-
pare detailed genetic maps, and in many cases, some of the specific functions of mapped genes 
have been clarified. In the case of Cannabis, this work is in its infancy. In the future, genetic engi-
neering of Cannabis may greatly facilitate the production of plants with extremely well-defined 
characteristics that are very desirable for purposes of industry, medicine, and law enforcement 
(De Meijer 2014).
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• According to Leggett (2006), a hectare of outdoor marijuana plants could supply 10,000 
“light users” with a daily dose for a year, and about 160 km2 (100 square miles) could simi-
larly provide a year’s supply for all of the world’s marijuana smokers.
• The Eden Project is a large-scale environmental complex near St Austell, Cornwall, 
England (Figure 14.9). The complex includes several transparent domes, the largest of 
which, the Tropical Biome, is claimed to be “the world’s largest greenhouse.” It covers 
1.56 ha and measures 55 m in height, 100 m in width, and 200 m in length. As noted in 
the text, a concentration of 32 cannabis plants/m2 has been recommended for optimal 
yield, and at this density, the Tropical Biome greenhouse could hold 640,000 plants. 
Commercial greenhouse complexes often link greenhouses together to occupy even 
larger acreages.
• The Crystal Palace was a giant glass and cast iron structure erected in Hyde Park, 
London, England, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851 (Figure 14.10). The building 
was 41 m high, with 71,794 m2 on the ground floor and a total of 92,000 m2 of exhibition 
space. The Crystal Palace was redesigned and moved to Sydenham Hill in 1854, where 
it burned down in 1936. At a concentration of 32 plants/m2, it could have held three mil-
lion cannabis plants.

15 The Commercial 
Marijuana Revolution
A SEA CHANGE FOR BETTER OR WORSE
The early twenty-first century is a watershed period, witnessing an astonishing transformation of 
the status of high-THC cannabis from an entirely black market industry to considerable “legiti-
macy.” The 11th edition (2012) of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary defines “legitimate” as 
“(1): to give legal status or authorization to; (2): to show or affirm to be justified; (3): to lend authority 
or respectability to.” This chapter discusses marijuana from the point of view of (1), i.e., as a legal-
ized commodity. Whether cannabis commercialization is “justified” (sense 2) or is “respectable” 
(sense 3) remains a matter of controversy. Although many are inflexibly opposed to any softening 
of current cannabis legislation, there is a growing viewpoint that marijuana prohibition has been a 
multitrillion dollar failed social experiment and needs to be replaced with a rational management 
approach. This chapter is mainly concerned with managing the factors that bear on maximizing 
benefits while minimizing risks associated with commercialized marijuana—but in the real world 
rather than an idealistic context. Life is frequently a choice between flawed alternatives, necessitat-
ing management of the winds of change by adapting to their direction.
The term “cannabusiness” (“cannabiz” for short) is often encountered currently, indicating 
commerce in medical and/or recreational cannabis. However, in the recent past, the term has also 
been employed to include the industrial hemp industries, which were discussed in detail in earlier 
chapters.
The legalization of marijuana commerce is occurring only in certain locations, but the fact that 
this includes some states of the United States, the leader in establishing commercial trends, sug-
gests that this trend will continue. Indeed, there is a veritable tidal wave of new legal commercial 
activities related to cannabis. Growth in medical and recreational aspects concerning cannabis is 
so explosive that the developing commerce has been described as a lucrative “green gold rush.” 
Despite persisting stigma and legal concerns attached to marijuana, investment capital is rapidly 
being directed to the authorized medical cannabis industries and even to the developing recreational 
white market. Marijuana has become increasingly available without significant restrictions in some 
places, and resulting quasi-legal activities have often resulted in extensive confusion among law 
enforcement, businesses, and consumers. Clear regulations need to be based on consideration of the 
best public health interests of society at large.
This chapter addresses the commercial and associated regulatory aspects of both medical and 
recreational cannabis. Although significantly different considerations apply, from a business per-
spective, the two areas are becoming intertwined. Production of marijuana is much the same, 
whether for medical or recreational usage, and there are common concerns about security, regula-
tions, business models, safety, and consumer acceptance. Moreover, as discussed later in this chap-
ter, the potentially much more profitable recreational market is the long-term target of many who 
have invested in the development of medical marijuana.
COMMERCIAL OBSCURATION OF THE DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN MEDICAL AND RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
Chapter 12 discussed the nonmedical (largely recreational) use of marijuana, and Chapter 13 reviewed 
the medical aspects. The distinction between medical and recreational use is straightforward: 

372
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
recreational cannabis is employed to get high, while medical cannabis is used to get healthier. 
Other mind-affecting substances are similarly used, but like marijuana, until recently, the recre-
ational usage remains entirely illegal (later in this chapter, opioids and laughing gas are discussed as 
guiding parallel business/regulatory examples). Prescription pharmaceuticals are potentially quite 
toxic and so require highly qualified professionals to recommend, formulate, dispense, and some-
times also to administer, and cannabis is increasingly being recognized as deserving of such status. 
However, in many jurisdictions, allegedly “medical” marijuana is being peddled in establishments 
(debatably labeled as “dispensaries”) by advisers with about the same limited credentials as clerks 
in “health food” establishments. Much worse, as noted next, some doctors are clearly betraying their 
profession by aiding those who simply wish to use marijuana recreationally.
Physician GatekeePers for hire to Provide LeGaL access to PseudoPatients
A questionable aspect of the establishment of medical marijuana dispensation in some jurisdictions is 
the virtual authorization of bogus “patients” with fictitious or marginal conditions to determine their 
own consumption protocol—i.e., to self-medicate (Hazekamp and Pappus 2014; Figure 15.1). In this 
laissez-faire environment, one of the less savory employment niches that has appeared with the increas-
ing popularity of medical marijuana is the need for prescriptions (or “recommendations” or “approv-
als,” depending on local regulations) from medical professionals, simply to obtain material. While most 
physicians are ethical and will not prescribe marijuana without justification, there are some who are 
incentivized simply by the opportunity for lucrative fees. In several of the U.S. states that have authorized 
medical marijuana, it has been embarrassingly clear that the bar to obtain scripts for marijuana is very 
low and that many in perfect health have been authorized to smoke pot for trumped-up illnesses. This 
is evident by studies in California showing that “patients” at medical marijuana clinics are overwhelm-
ingly young white men experienced in the use of recreational marijuana (Reinarman et al. 2011). Regan 
(2011) wrote that “California doctors have the latitude to prescribe marijuana for pretty much anything. 
Although California law suggests doctors recommend marijuana for patients over the age of 18 who are 
suffering from a specific set of diseases, the law also includes a provision allowing pot for ‘any other 
illness for which marijuana provides relief.’ So the reality is, anyone who wants pot can get a ‘recom-
mendation’ for marijuana. Headaches, anxiety, trouble sleeping, you name it…recommending marijuana 
has become a thriving business in and of itself, as the multitude of doctors’ advertisements in the back 
FIGURE 15.1 Medical marijuana malpractice. Prepared by B. Brookes.
 

373
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
of the pot magazines’ ‘yellow pages’ suggest. Doctors typically charge a $200 consultation fee, and I’ve 
never heard of anyone being denied a recommendation. There are currently an estimated four hundred 
thousand medicinal marijuana patients in the state.” Caulkins et al. (2012) described marijuana doctors 
as follows: “The physicians who write most of the recommendations openly advertise, promising not to 
diagnose and treat illness but simply to provide a recommendation. Some even advertise that the visit 
is free unless it results in a recommendation. Others have advertisements, or even storefronts, that list a 
range of conditions for which they will write marijuana recommendations. It’s hard to take this seriously 
as the practice of medicine.”
PrescriPtion druGs vs. over-the-counter herbaLs
In Chapter 13, the debate between medical use of purified pharmaceutical chemicals and crude 
(herbal) drugs was presented, and it was argued that herbal drugs in the hands of qualified pro-
fessionals can be as effective as pure drugs that can only be obtained by prescription. However, 
unlike prescribed pure drugs, which are necessarily best managed by highly educated and 
experienced personnel, numerous herbal preparations, such as echinacea, garlic, ginkgo, gin-
seng, and valerian, are typically dispensed by clerks who are personable and enthusiastic but 
often dangerously uninformed. There are emerging markets for both prescription and over-
the-counter marijuana, and this is another important factor muddying the distinction between 
medicinal and recreational cannabis.
From an investment perspective, there are very few enterprises as lucrative as the pharmaceuti-
cal industry. This is because patented products (or manufacturing processes contributing to them) 
that are either uniquely effective or popular can result in enormous long-term profits. Traditional 
herbal preparations (raw plant materials) cannot be patented but can often earn appreciable revenues 
from sales in health food stores and outlets for over-the-counter (nonprescription) drugs and use by 
alternative health practitioners as well as those who subscribe to self-medication. Herbal marijuana, 
however, is in a class by itself, currently and for the foreseeable future much more popular and prof-
itable in the burgeoning medicinal marijuana herbal sector than the patented formulations presently 
offered by pharmaceutical companies. “Cannabinoid-based medication—mainly based on delta-
9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)—has not been able to significantly reduce 
the worldwide use of [herbal] cannabis as a medicine. Cannabis seems…on the one hand too potent 
to be regulated as an herbal (or alternative) medicine, on the other hand too herbal to be regarded as 
conventional medicine” (Hazekamp and Pappus 2014).
THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICIAN ACCEPTANCE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS
Chapter 13 details research on medical aspects of cannabis, summarizing majority opinions on 
the merits of marijuana in treating numerous illnesses. Regardless of the assessments of medi-
cal researchers (who, like all scientists, sometimes have exaggerated evaluations of the adequacy 
of their findings), practicing clinical doctors tend to be very conservative and reluctant to adopt 
new treatments without very convincing evidence. The community of physicians who actually treat 
patients represents the most critical filter limiting the success and failure of medicinal marijuana, 
not just as therapy but as the subject of commerce.
softeninG of MedicaL oPPosition
Despite the current vociferous opposition to medical use of marijuana by many physicians, Adler and 
Colbert (2013) reported on the surprising result of a survey of medical professionals (New England 
Journal of Medicine 2013). Readers were asked to vote on two opposing positions: (1) Marijuana 
should be used medically “only when conservative options have failed for fully informed patients 
treated in ongoing therapeutic relationships” or (2) “there is little scientific basis for physicians to 
 

374
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
endorse smoked marijuana as a medical therapy.” The majority (76% of 1446 votes, mostly from 
North America) were cast in favor of marijuana.
Medicine by PoPuLar vote
Pharmaceutical companies incessantly advertise their wares on the popular media, clearly to per-
suade patients to influence their doctors to prescribe them, although physicians are obviously much 
more qualified than their patients to choose the most appropriate therapies. In the case of therapeu-
tic forms of cannabis, physicians are often being overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of patients to be 
treated with cannabis. Moreover, the demand for legislation allowing medical cannabis to be avail-
able in some jurisdictions has been determined not primarily by medical opinion but by popular 
demand. Although in theory, the wisdom of legalizing medical marijuana should be evaluated prin-
cipally by the medical profession, in practice, prevailing societal demand is proving to be determina-
tive, a phenomenon that has been termed “medicine by popular vote” (Voth 2001; Bostwick 2012).
PROFIT-DRIVEN VS. HEALTH-DRIVEN MEDICAL MARIJUANA
While business people and sometimes even corporations can be extremely ethical and conscientious, 
there is perhaps an inevitable amorality to most profit-centered ventures. Already, some newly cre-
ated medical marijuana establishments are peddling their wares with the same exaggerated rhetoric 
by which cars and detergent are advertised. As noted in Chapter 13, normal human stress has been 
excessively medicalized, contributing to an epidemic of mood-altering drugs, and some physicians 
are adding marijuana to the list of needless prescriptions. At present, governmental regulations are 
highly restrictive in most jurisdictions, limiting the possibility of harm. All things considered, mari-
juana is so prevalent that if it were seriously toxic in the limited amounts it is usually consumed, its 
harm for the majority of adults would have been revealed by now. Nevertheless, wisdom dictates 
that a great deal of caution needs to be exercised with respect to both personal and societal health 
issues as marijuana becomes increasingly legitimatized.
PATIENT FINANCIAL REIMBURSEMENT
The cost of medicines, in the main, is eligible for subsidization from public and private insurance 
systems. Medical marijuana and cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals (to say nothing of parapher-
nalia) could be eligible under insurance schemes, although many will find the very idea curious. 
A basic problem is distinguishing actual patients from those posing as such to obtain recreational 
drugs, and this issue is not easily solved since marijuana intergrades between a genuine medicine 
and a recreational intoxicant. Unfortunately, many real patients live on small budgets, and because 
of the lack of funds to purchase sometimes expensive pharmaceutical-grade marijuana and cannabi-
noid drugs, those without insurance may feel forced to buy unreliable street material. Philanthropy 
in the private sector is limited (except for public relations purposes), and a common response when a 
costly medicine is in large demand is for nongovernmental organizations and/or the state to achieve 
savings by large-scale purchases. At present, medical marijuana “clubs” are popular in some places, 
contributing to limiting costs. Perhaps, unlike any other substance, the threat of street-available 
marijuana remains a brake on cost inflation of herbal marijuana.
MEDICAL VS. RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA MARKETS
Medical marijuana inherently suggests the nobility of the medical profession, while recreational mari-
juana has its roots in the illicit, evil, and dangerous underworld. Medical marijuana is now authorized 
in many countries and is produced according to stringent quality standards. In principle, exactly the 
same material can be employed as recreational marijuana, albeit far fewer locations authorize this at 
 

375
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
present. Although most investment in cannabis is ostensibly in the field of medical marijuana, there 
is widespread realization that for most companies, the profit potential is much larger in the area of 
recreational marijuana. Accordingly, major players are strategizing to invest in medical marijuana 
with the long-term goal of expanding into a recreational market. Recreational marijuana has a negative 
image that can dissuade investment, so one tactic (“serious and studious”) that is advantageous is to 
associate the company with legitimate medical research, pharmacological representatives, and bona 
fide medical dispensers and to create or sell products with at least some proven efficacy. Companies of 
this nature tend to market marijuana strains with very conservative names. The opposing strategy is to 
target an audience that views recreational marijuana sympathetically (even if it is only available in the 
form of medical marijuana). Such companies tend to offer marijuana strains with ostentatious street 
names, a variety of edibles, smoking apparatus (especially bongs), and T-shirts with psychedelic logos. 
Companies specializing in medical marijuana are resentful of those promoting recreational marijuana 
aspects, since it degrades the seriousness of the industry.
THE ROLE OF “BIG TOBACCO”
Smoking has been widely practiced for centuries (Figure 15.2), but at least in Western nations, tobacco 
is a dying industry, the result of its horrific effects on human health. Smoking tobacco is estimated 
to kill six million people worldwide annually (Barry et al. 2014). Tobacco companies are anxious 
to diversify into more viable products (notably, for a period there were attempts to extract proteins 
from tobacco leaves to prepare edible “tobacco burgers”). Facetiously, the concerns regarding dangers 
to human health and the repugnant aspects of peddling a socially condemned product that would 
repel many potential investors might actually be attractive to the tobacco sector. For years, there has 
been suspicion that tobacco-based interests have been examining the possibility of investing in legiti-
mized herbal marijuana production and distribution. Given its expertise in producing nicotine-based 
smoking products and paraphernalia, the tobacco industry is well preadapted to establishing “Big 
Marijuana.” “Legalizing marijuana opens the market to major corporations, including tobacco compa-
nies which have the financial resources, product design technology to optimize puff-by-puff delivery 
of a psycho active drug (nicotine), marketing muscle, and political clout to transform the marijuana 
market” (Barry et al. 2014). The recent consumer emphasis on vaping tobacco rather than smoking

it is perfectly aligned with the same trend for marijuana. Very large scale, as exemplified by corpo-
ratization, may well be a prerequisite to future success of the recreational marijuana industry, and 
certainly tobacco corporations have the size, capitalization, and perspective to dominate a free-market 
marijuana-based economy. The tobacco industry is old and conservative, which may explain its low 
profile to date on the subject, but there is evidence of its attention to marijuana (Barry et al. 2014), and 
it would not be surprising for tobacco interests to be surreptitiously venturing into cannabis.
PROFESSIONAL NICHES IN THE DEVELOPING MARIJUANA BUSINESS SECTOR
The illicit marijuana market has spawned legitimate or at least quasi-legal employment for many. 
Of course, the millions of individuals who have been caught running afoul of the law have needed 
legal representation, and monumental investment has gone into policing and imprisonment. On the 
borders of legality, stores specializing in hydroponics, lights, and similar cultivation equipment 
required to grow the plants have benefitted, as have “headshops,” organizers of marijuana festivals, 
and writers specializing in counterculture publications. These profitable fringe activities have con-
vinced many that legalized marijuana can be developed by rebels and misfits.
However, legalized marijuana production and marketing are definitely not industries to be 
pursued by amateurs. Much more so than most other business activities, there are very demand-
ing needs to prepare extensive applications for approval, to keep accurate records, to tolerate 
inspections, and to regularly file detailed reports. Working with several aspects of marijuana 
can be dangerous, both from the criminal element and by inadvertently failing to comply with 
often ambiguous regulations. There are stringent requirements best satisfied by dedicated pro-
fessionals. Many are finding employment in ancillary services allied to the emerging marijuana 
industry (Figure 15.3) or are simply benefitting indirectly from it (Figure 15.4). Particularly 
in demand are commercial property and leasing managers, insurance specialists, security

personnel, financial and banking institutions, legal advisers, tax specialists, accountants, pub-
lic relations and advertising representatives, horticulturalists, retailers, and media-savvy Web 
designers. With the expansion of professionals dedicated to facets of the marijuana industry, 
there is a parallel need for the establishment of trade associations and advisory councils to 
ensure that production and sales follow best practices and that ethical standards are maintained.
OPPOSITION TO COMMERCIALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
Any venture into the commercialization of marijuana needs to take account of the persisting social, 
moral, scientific, and political opposition. A century of prohibitionist policies and a negative image 
mean that many, indeed most, investors are likely to shy away from involvement.
MedicaL oPPosition to recreationaL Marijuana
The most important source of opposition to recreational marijuana is a substantial proportion of the med-
ical profession. The following statement succinctly summarize concerns (also see Chapters 12 and 13):
“Owing to limited funding and study opportunities, marijuana and health professionals and 
policy makers do not yet know the full scope of the effects of marijuana use; however, the 
evidence demonstrates that the regular consumption of marijuana does increase the risk of 
physical and mental health problems… The general consensus among substance abuse pro-
fessionals is that underage marijuana use can be both dangerous and addictive. Studies show 
that teenagers’ use can lead to negative physical, psychological, and behavioral consequences, 
such as chronic cough and bronchitis, memory deficits, and a loss of up to 8 points in I.Q. 
Additional public health issues… as a result of legalization include… acute health effects 
from contaminated marijuana products, the safety of edible marijuana products, accidental 
poisoning of young children from edible products, use among pregnant and breast-feeding 
women, secondhand smoke… substance abuse, potential impaired driving.”
(Hickenlooper 2014; the governor of Colorado, a state which contradictorily has 
authorized not just medical but also recreational marijuana)

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
PoLiticaL oPPosition to recreationaL Marijuana
In most of the Western world, marijuana remains a prohibited drug, often with exceptions for medi-
cal usage. Most governments are hostile to changing the status of cannabis, continuing to devote 
large resources to antimarijuana education and law enforcement. However, in several countries, 
court decisions based on personal rights, and referenda, have led to softening of laws restricting 
marijuana. In Canada, the government was elected in 2015 on a policy of authorizing the use of rec-
reational marijuana. In the United States, the national government remains opposed to recreational 
use, although initiatives in some individual states have led to recreational marijuana becoming 
available.
As reviewed in earlier chapters, a majority of scientists and the public now accept that marijuana 
is not as deleterious as once believed, although not without significant harm, and that reformation of 
legislation is desirable to permit regulated usage. The governments of many nations have sponsored 
studies of the wisdom of laws limiting the use of marijuana (and indeed of other “drugs of abuse”), 
based particularly on harm potential, but these analyses have usually been hesitant to make decisive 
recommendations, although often reinforcing the view that marijuana legislation requires updating 
and emphasizing that further research is necessary. The fundamental issue to be addressed is how 
permissive or restrictive revised legislation should be.
badMouthinG the coMPetition
Curiously, many developing sectors of the nascent marijuana industry are very critical of each other, 
an obvious badmouthing of the competition in order to protect market share. For example, small 
dispensaries are horrified at the prospect that chain drug outlets could dominate retail aspects; 
medical dispensaries are opposed to the legalization of recreational marijuana because it reduces 
their profit potential and cheapens their image; and pharmaceutical-based companies, interested 
in cannabinoid drugs, see cheap mass-produced herbal cannabis as a severe limitation on future 
profits. Probably the most ironic objection to legitimizing marijuana is by the criminal trade, which 
faces the prospect of losing a substantial part of its drug-based income.
GROWING SOCIETAL ACCEPTANCE OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
In a democracy, public opinion is the final arbiter of all issues, not scientists, politicians, or any 
other influential representatives of the people. It has been estimated that about 4% of the world’s 
population consumes cannabis annually (Leggett 2006). However, in some countries, the major-
ity of young people have smoked it, and there are strong indications of growing social acceptance 
and cultural normalization. As noted later, recreational marijuana is quite freely available in the 
Netherlands without fear of legal consequences, but this is very unusual. The critical development 
that is being closely observed is recent establishment of recreational marijuana industries in states 
like Colorado and Washington. This is regarded as a large-scale social experiment, and given the 
importance of the United States in influencing modern trends, it is possible that the results could 
either stimulate or discourage wider acceptance in the Western world. A key analysis of the pos-
sible future of recreational marijuana is provided by Galston and Dionne (2013). They note that in 
less than a decade, public opinion has shifted dramatically toward support of marijuana legaliza-
tion and that 48% of Americans have personally used marijuana. Furthermore, a slim majority of 
Americans believe that it is less harmful than alcohol to individuals and society (by contrast, over 
75% accept medical marijuana as beneficial). However, Galston and Dionne note that although sup-
port for legalization is growing, a substantial number of Americans are strongly opposed, and those 
who are in favor of legalization do not consider consumption harmless but rather view criminaliza-
tion as harmful. Indeed, in Western countries, there has been a general trend to decriminalize drug 
abuse. Galston and Dionne concluded that “Over the long run, the attitudes of Americans…on the 
 

379
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
question will be shaped by whether the various experiments with legalization, decriminalization, 
and the use of marijuana for medical purposes are deemed successes or failures.”
THE NEED FOR CAUTION IN LEGITIMIZING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
Any material that produces a euphoric state will be used to excess by some individuals. Alcohol and 
tobacco, which are physically addictive for many, have had devastating effects on human health. 
“Indeed, if alcohol were a newly formulated beverage, its high toxicity and addiction potential 
would surely prevent it from being marketed as a food or drug” (Gable 2006). Sugar, which is also 
psychologically addictive, is responsible for much of the current obesity epidemic. Clearly, some 
addictive substances are so dangerous that extreme efforts are justified to prevent or reduce their 
usage, at least in most circumstances, but just as clearly, in a free society, a majority of adults cannot 
be prevented from choosing to consume what they wish. The issue that needs to be resolved is what 
level of loosening of control over cannabis is advisable.
While this book is not intended to judge the wisdom of increasing authorized consumption of 
marijuana, either for medicinal or recreational purposes, it would be remiss to ignore the likelihood 
that some people are likely to be harmed. As discussed in Chapter 12, cannabis can produce anxi-
ety, panic, and even paranoia in naïve users and anxious subjects and has significant potential for 
inducing psychological harm in adolescents and people with serious psychological vulnerabilities or 
suffering from mental illness. As also discussed in Chapter 12, cannabis additionally has potential 
to lower performance in handling equipment and automobiles and in conducting activities demand-
ing alertness and manual dexterity, so inappropriate use could contribute to accidents and lowered 
productivity. Some additional issues are discussed in the following.
chronic consuMPtion
Based on surveys in several countries, it appears that about 14% of illicit cannabis users consume 
marijuana daily (Leggett 2006). In the United States, about 12% of drinkers report imbibing eight or 
more alcoholic drinks in the past week—averaging more than one per day. In both cases, such high 
“In a free and democratic society, which recognizes fundamentally but not exclusively the 
rule of law as the source of normative rules and in which government must promote autonomy 
as far as possible and therefore make only sparing use of the instruments of constraint, public 
policy on psychoactive substances must be structured around guiding principles respecting 
the life, health, security and rights and freedoms of individuals, who, naturally and legiti-
mately, seek their own well-being and development and can recognize the presence, differ-
ence and equality of others.”
Report of the Canadian Senate special committee on illegal drugs (2002)
http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/371/ille/rep/summary-e.htm
“For the first time in the more than four-decade history of polling on marijuana issues, a Pew 
poll in 2013 showed that a majority of people in the United States supported legalization. The 
sharp contrast between the growing support for legalization, which outstrips the percentage of 
the population currently using marijuana, must reflect some degree of a rejection of paternalism… 
some portion of the population must be rejecting the paternalistic decision of regulators to 
remove a person’s autonomy when it comes to choosing to use marijuana.”

consumption is related to concerns about negative health effects. Often, regular usage of an inebriating 
drug is correlated with development of tolerance or insensitivity, so that higher amounts need to be 
consumed in order to achieve the same psychological state. Accordingly, the drive to consume in regu-
lar users can be exacerbated. Whether one’s social drug is marijuana or alcohol, it appears that a very 
high proportion of usage (and potential profits) is concentrated in fairly small subpopulations. About 
half of alcohol profits come from one-quarter of alcohol drinkers, and one wonders about the sincerity 
of “Big Alcohol” advertising that their customers should “drink responsibly.” A very large proportion 
of booze and virtually all cigarettes are consumed by addicts. In the same vein, Werb et al. (2012) esti-
mated that over 90% of illicit cannabis in British Columbia was purchased by daily marijuana users. 
The relative harm of marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol is frequently debated, but there is agreement that 
excessive usage of drugs is undesirable, and adding marijuana to the set of legal social drugs may be 
particularly hazardous for those with a propensity to develop very high usage.
effects of increased avaiLabiLity of authorized cannabis
Increased allowable usage of marijuana is occurring especially in North America. Although autho-
rization of medical usage, as well as decriminalization and permitted recreational usage, are very 
recent and by no means universal, there have been several studies of the associated social and medi-
cal effects. This information is relevant to business aspects because of the associated challenges 
faced by the cannabis industry in the future—in persuading the public, politicians, the medical 
profession, and indeed other business interests of the legitimacy of cannabis commercial activities.
Effects on Prevalence of Usage
Gorman and Huber (2007), on the basis of arrest and emergency hospital data, concluded that “consistent 
with other studies of the liberalization of cannabis laws, medical cannabis laws do not appear to increase 
use of the drug.” In a study of adolescent usage, Lynne-Landsman et al. (2013) found that medical mari-
juana laws “have not measurably affected adolescent marijuana use in the first few years after their enact-
ment. Longer-term results, after MMLs are more fully implemented, might be different.” Nevertheless, 
in U.S. states with medical marijuana laws, rates of marijuana usage increased (Cerdá et al. 2012; Harper 
et al. 2012). However, whether liberalization of laws causes increased usage is unclear. Cerdá et al. (2012) 
noted that “Future research needs to examine whether the association is causal, or is due to an underly-
ing common cause, such as community norms supportive of the legalization of medical marijuana and 
of marijuana use.” From a commercial perspective, increased usage is desirable simply to increase the 
customer populations, but from a public health perspective, the opposite is often true.
Effects on Health
Cerdá et al. (2012) found that marijuana abuse/dependence was more prevalent in states with relaxed 
availability of marijuana, but suggested that this was accounted for simply by higher rates of use. As 
noted in the next section, it is conceivable that if marijuana becomes more available legally, the usage 
of more deleterious substances (debatably including alcohol) might decrease because of substitution.
Effects on Crime Rate
By definition, if marijuana becomes legal, the crime rate will drop! Indeed one might predict that 
overdosing on other illicit substances might decrease if marijuana became more accessible legally. 
Contrary to expectation that the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes poses a danger 
to public health in terms of exposure to violent crime and property crimes, Morris et al. (2014) 
found no evidence of increased crime in 11 states that had authorized the establishment of medical 
marijuana dispensaries. Similarly, Shepard and Blackley (2016) found that “There is no evidence 
of negative spillover effects from medical marijuana laws (MMLs) on violent or property crime. 
Instead, we find significant drops in rates of violent crime associated with state MMLs.” However, 
Chu (2014) observed that medical marijuana authorization was associated with greater arrests for 
 

381

unauthorized (recreational) usage. Kepple and Freisthler (2012) found that the density of medical 
marijuana dispensaries seemed unassociated with crime rates and suggested that measures dispen-
saries take to reduce crime (such as doormen and video cameras) may deter offenders.
FINANCIAL GUESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL MONETARY 
VALUE OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
Black market commodities are highly inflated in cost, but nevertheless, the value of the illicit mari-
juana market is staggering. Gettman (2006) stated: “Domestic marijuana production has a value 
of $35.8 billion, more than corn and wheat combined, easily making it America’s largest and most 
lucrative cash crop.… Marijuana is the top cash crop in 12 states, one of the top 3 cash crops in 
30 states, and one of the top 5 cash crops in 39 states. The domestic marijuana crop is larger than 
cotton in Alabama, larger than grapes, vegetables and hay combined in California, larger than pea-
nuts in Georgia, and larger than tobacco in both South Carolina and North Carolina.”
Miron and Waldock (2010) estimated that, in the United States, about $9 billion would be gained 
annually from legalizing marijuana, due to savings in government expenditures of enforcement of 
marijuana prohibition.
In 2012, more than 300 economists, including three Nobel laureates, signed the following peti-
tion, suggesting that legalization of marijuana, combined with taxation, could produce the equiva-
lent of about $14 billion in revenue for the U.S. government:
An Open Letter to the President, Congress, 
Governors, and State Legislatures
We, the undersigned, call your attention to the attached [2005] report by Professor Jeffrey A. Miron, 
The Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition [http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/mironreport/]. 
The report shows that marijuana legalization – replacing prohibition with a system of taxation and 
 regulation – would save $7.7 billion per year in state and federal expenditures on prohibition enforce-
ment and produce tax revenues of at least $2.4 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like most 
consumer goods. If, however, marijuana were taxed similarly to alcohol or tobacco, it might generate 
as much as $6.2 billion annually.
Economist Stephen Easton (2009) wrote (in “Bloomberg Business/Debate Room” blog, not available):
The current prohibition on marijuana consumption exactly parallels the 1920s alcohol prohibition… 
like booze during Prohibition, this substance, marijuana, is the easy revenue of organized crime, con-
tributing tens of billions of dollars to growers, who commit a variety of bad acts both at home and 
abroad. How much money is made from this single illegal substance? In fairness, nobody knows for 
sure… total spending on marijuana may add up to $45 billion to $110 billion a year. What about possible 
tax revenue? From Canada we’ve learned that the production cost of [government-sponsored] marijuana 
is roughly 33¢ a gram. [Costs are higher, as noted later.] Currently, U.S. marijuana consumers pay at 
least $10 per gram retail for illegal marijuana. If the cost of retailing and distribution is the same as for 
legal tobacco cigarettes, about 10¢ a gram, then selling the (legal) product at exactly the same price as 
on the street today ($10 per gram) could raise $40 billion to $100 billion in new revenue. Not chump 
change. Government would simply be transferring revenue from organized crime to the public purse.
These descriptions of the size of the illegal and potentially legal marijuana industry for the 
United States are subjective and have been strongly disputed for several years. A principal point 
of contention is that the negative costs (for example, from intoxicated driving) are not considered. 
Moreover, because of the criminal, clandestine nature of most trade in marijuana at present, it is 
extremely difficult to evaluate the quantities of cannabis produced, trafficked, and consumed— 
traditional parameters of a market analysis. Despite these limitations, almost certainly potentially 
gigantic revenues are possible. Table 15.1 suggests possible comparative potential global earnings 
 

382

from both industrial and drug kinds of cannabis—estimates that necessarily are subject to very 
large errors.
While the current explosive interest in marijuana legitimization (whether exclusively for medi-
cine, a general decriminalization, or even comprehensive legalization) is being driven by sincere 
libertarians and believers in its potential medical benefits, financial considerations are often deter-
minative in human affairs (put simply, “money talks”). Benefits from marijuana taxes to local gov-
ernments may be as high as 100%, reflective of the tendency to impose heavy “sin taxes” on morally 
questionable commodities (often tolerated on the grounds that the funds will be used for noble 
purposes such as school and hospital construction). The ultimate economic impact of partial or 
complete legalization cannot be reliably predicted. Most marijuana is traded on the illicit market, 
and how this relates to a future legal market is uncertain. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus 
that medical marijuana is a multibillion dollar enterprise, and the value of recreational marijuana 
could be astronomical (Table 15.1).
The “Drug War” insofar as it has involved marijuana has clearly been very costly to the public 
purse, with huge expenditures dedicated to law enforcement (Duke 1995; see Collins 2014 for an 
extensive analysis of the drug war). Incarcerating many individuals for infractions involving mari-
juana not only involves considerable overhead costs but also removes them as potentially productive 
citizens during their imprisonment and often subsequently limits the employability of ex-convicts. 
Moreover, prohibition of any commodity demanded by a segment of society has huge costs result-
ing from criminal activities, such as street violence, bribery of public officials, tax avoidance, and 
health problems. Nevertheless, it is simplistic to think that removing the marijuana black market 
will substantially lower societal costs: it is possible that should criminals no longer be able to benefit 
from trade in marijuana, they will simply turn to other illicit commodities that are equally or even 
more deleterious to society.
ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF LEGITIMIZING RECREATIONAL 
MARIJUANA ON THE ILLEGITIMATE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY
For good or evil, regions that have been centers of production and trade in illicit marijuana will 
suffer economically should legalization occur. Producers of illegal marijuana range from small-
scale cottage industry (often conducted by students or “mom and pop” entrepreneurs) to large-scale 
operations sponsored by organized crime. The distortion on local economies can be spectacular, 
affecting a wide range of businesses, especially those selling expensive goods and services. In 
northern California’s Emerald Triangle (overlapping Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties), 
it has been estimated that marijuana accounts for up to two-thirds of economic activity in the 
region, and property values have become highly dependent on their marijuana-growing potential

The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
(Regan 2011). As a result, “there are an awful lot of young people driving BMW’s, Mercedes, and 
tricked-out trucks. Local fast-food restaurant owners complain they can’t find high school students 
willing to work in their restaurants because there’s so much more money to be made in the mari-
juana trade” (Regan 2011).
COSTS OF PRODUCTION OF MARIJUANA
Chapter 14 presented information on the production of medical marijuana indoors, and in particu-
lar documented yields on an area and harvest basis (keep in mind that indoor cultivation typically 
produces four harvests annually). To summarize the key production efficiency data presented in 
Chapter 14, the literature indicates that yields (indoor production, weight/area) usually range from 
about 250 to about 500 g/m2/harvest, with four harvests expected annually.
Leaving aside the special costs for security, if marijuana could be produced outdoors like hemp, the 
cost of production would be dirt cheap. Gieringer (1994) stated that “In an untaxed free market, can-
nabis ought to be as cheap as other leaf crops. Bulk marijuana might reasonably retail at the price of 
other medicinal herbs, around $0.75–$1.50 an ounce. Premium cured and manicured sinsemilla buds 
might be compared to fine teas, which range up to $2 per ounce, or to pipe tobacco, which retails for 
$1.25–$2.00.” (These figures are unrealistically low, as noted in the following paragraphs.)
The cost of marijuana is substantial when grown in greenhouses (with or without supple-
mental lighting), but given that ornamentals and vegetables are often grown out-of-season in 
greenhouses, marijuana could equally be produced relatively cheaply. The cost is magnified 
at least 10 times when marijuana is produced indoors with just artificial lighting, as is usually 
done currently. The major cost factor is electricity, particularly for lighting, but also for climate 
control. Stringent security requirements at present usually dictate indoor growing with no or 
very limited natural light, but should greenhouse cultivation be permitted, the cost of produc-
tion would diminish substantially, and should outdoor growth be allowed, the costs would 
decrease dramatically.
Economies of scale in production of cannabis are discussed by Hawken and Prieger (2013), who 
point out that large-scale operations (at least 200 m2 or several thousand square feet) are much more 
efficient than small-scale facilities, and volume discounts for large consumers of electricity may 
also be significant. They also note that when the goal is production of trimmed buds, trimmers 
may constitute about 50% of total labor (although machine trimming can lower the burden). Capital 
investment costs in physical facilities are discussed by Caulkins (2010) and Hawken and Prieger 
(2013). Except for the special requirements for security, the facilities necessary are comparable to 
what is needed for indoor crops in general, although medicinal plants are a more reasonable basis 
for comparison than are flowers or vegetables.
Hawken and Prieger (2013) indicate that marijuana can be produced under artificial illumination 
for approximately $2.00 to $2.25 per gram, the costs decreasing when investments are prorated 
for longer periods and for about half these figures when produced in greenhouses (using mostly 
natural light). Retail costs for medical marijuana usually range from $10.00 to $20.00 per gram. In 
the United States, black market (illicit) marijuana averages about $13.00/g. In some jurisdictions, 
licensed medical marijuana is available at cheaper prices than the illegal street counterpart!
In Canada, production costs have been claimed to be as low as U.S.$2.20 per gram, employ-
ing natural light greenhouses, which, as noted previously, are substantially more economical than 
growth rooms using artificial light (Koven 2015).
ELEMENTARY BUSINESS HAZARDS: WILL THE “POT 
BOOM” BECOME A “POT BUBBLE?”
There is phenomenal enthusiasm for investment in marijuana, the market amusingly described

business, and green gold rush. Many expect that just as dot.com billionaires were created dur-
ing the computer revolution, so marijuana moguls are in line for great wealth (Figure 15.5). It 
is well to be reminded that most new market commodities go through a life cycle, with several 
phases. Figure 15.6 illustrates in a hypothetical fashion the relationship of profitability and 
time for many new (especially patent-free) products in a free market economy, the situation 
that prevails for most traditional marijuana products, especially herbal forms. Phase 1 is the 
period of investment in research and development, necessary to bring a new product to the 
point of profitability (most new products in fact do not survive this foundational period). Most 
classes of recreational marijuana and associated paraphernalia are well beyond phase 1, but 
many forms of pharmaceutical preparations are very new or being researched. During phase 2, 
the market expands, along with profitability. Phase 3 is a stable period of profitability, at the 
end of which decline in profits occurs (phase 4). The most common cause of the decline in 
profitability is copycat competition from those who have observed the profitability of the item.

385
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
The more lucrative a given product becomes, the faster competition develops. A frequent con-
sequence of such competition is oversaturation of the market, the generation of surpluses, and 
business failures of those who remained dependent on the sale of the once-profitable item. 
Developing new products (phase 1) is extremely risky but offers the greatest potential rewards 
because the inertia from having a large head start may allow one to rapidly capture a large pro-
portion of the potential market and to hold that market for a long period. New pharmaceutical 
products, new manufacturing processes, and new applications, most of which are associated 
with intellectual property rights, are the riskiest but potentially the most profitable aspects of 
the marijuana industry. Provided that competition is still limited, the safest strategy is copying 
the example of those who recently established marijuana businesses centered on production, 
manufacturing, and distribution of herbal and extracted forms of marijuana based on public 
domain techniques. The most common mistake is belated investment in a popular commodity 
that has demonstrated sustained high profitability but for which the market is rapidly becom-
ing oversaturated. In some areas of Los Angeles, medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber 
McDonald restaurants (more than 1000 dispensaries are claimed to be present in the city), and 
such proliferation of “pot shops” has developed in several North American cities (Figure 15.7), 
including Vancouver, British Columbia.
The laws of supply and demand and market timing ultimately determine profitability, and 
legal marijuana as a commodity is in the enviable position of having limited supply and enor-
mous potential demand. However, this situation invites competition, rapid overinvestment, and 
the generation of an oversupply resulting in a depression of the market. In this regard, the his-
tory of Cannabis sativa introduction in Canada for industrial hemp is instructive. Authorization 
to grow licensed industrial hemp began in 1998. For several years thereafter, hundreds of 
licenses were acquired, mostly by idealistic individuals with limited experience in farming 
FIGURE 15.7 The marijuana dispensary bubble. Top: Before; bottom: after. Prepared by B. Brookes.
 

386
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
and business. The result was widespread crop and business failures, bankruptcies, and an enor-
mous glut of hempseed and hemp fiber that depressed the market, making industrial hemp 
unprofitable in the country for years. A parallel situation has developed in Canada for medical 
marijuana. The production of medicinal marijuana was authorized by just one major company 
in Canada from 2002 to 2013. As of 2015, any company satisfying rather demanding regula-
tions can produce medical marijuana, and there have been more than 1000 license applications 
(although only a few dozen have been approved). The frenzy of new entrants was accompanied 
by marijuana companies issuing stock offerings, and the resulting giant marijuana stock bubble 
that was formed in 2014 collapsed in the same year (Koven and Pett 2015). However, with the 
election of a new government expected to authorize recreational marijuana, cannabis has once 
again become a hot commodity in the Canadian marketplace.
In the United States, there has been a frenzy of stock offerings in marijuana companies, and 
as of 2016, there have been associated reports of plummeting stock values. The British firm 
GW Pharmaceuticals, specializing in compounded cannabinoid extract preparations, is quite 
exceptional in its success (reportedly valued at $2 billion) and its stock offerings have been 
very profitable.
POSSIBLE SCENARIOS OF SUCCESS OR COLLAPSE 
OF SECTORS OF THE MARIJUANA MARKET
herbaL
Law enforcement agencies have often assigned a value of $1000.00 to a single marijuana plant. 
While this is an exaggeration, it is clear that on the black market, marijuana has a very large value. 
Even when produced legally, marijuana is an exceptionally valuable commodity. The National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, the only federally legal supplier in the United States, charges researchers 
$1525.00 per kg, or $7.00 per joint (Reardon 2015). The elevated price is necessary because pro-
duction costs are very high (primarily because of the high costs of security and indoor production 
and the need to conform to quality standards). The very high price for the U.S. national supply of 
marijuana is artificial, a result of a tightly controlled market. In reality, marijuana plants can be 
grown and turned into product very cheaply, a circumstance in which the possibility of a market 
crash exists should regulations permit free competition.
At present, growing marijuana (even for personal consumption) is almost universally illegal, 
and this very strongly inhibits home cultivation. However, should recreational marijuana become 
widely available, it is likely that attitudes toward personal cultivation of plants will change. Were 
home cultivation to be widely permitted, it could drastically curtail commercial market demand 
for herbal forms of the plant, or at least suppress profitability. One may well ask why people do not 
grow their own tobacco plants, but this is probably because preparing high-quality tobacco is a very 
demanding art and science, while almost any dummy can raise a pot of pot, especially since equip-
ment for cultivation is accessible via the Internet and from “grow-shops.” Moreover, a very high 
percentage of cannabis growers cultivate the plant not primarily for profit but for enjoyment and 
ideology (Hammersvik et al. 2012). According to Leggett (2006): “With the possible exception of 
some amphetamine-type stimulants, cannabis is the only drug where the entire market chain, from 
production to consumption, can be contained in a single individual.”
extracts
There are numerous financial risks associated with the development of new pharmaceuticals, par-
ticularly those based on plant extracts (see Whittle and Guy 2004 for an analysis of issues related 
to cannabis). Nevertheless, pharmaceutical extracts and formulations based on extracts represent a 
particularly promising sector of the medical marijuana industry. Indeed, for decades, governments 
 

387
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
and the medical profession have been sympathetic to the idea of completely replacing herbal mari-
juana with pure chemicals for medical purposes (a movement termed “pharmaceuticalization of 
marijuana”). While some proprietary products seem promising, none has reached the status of a 
breakthrough drug, and like all ventures, the possibility exists of market failure. Moreover, non-
patented extracts can be prepared relatively easily, leading to the possibility that products intended 
for the medical market could face cheap competition. Candidly, extracts for use in vaporizers for 
the recreational market may represent the most profitable new market niche, but like tobacco-based 
vaporization, social pressure may limit usage (at least in public).
Why Not Harvest CBD from Hemp?
CBD represents a particularly promising investment opportunity. As detailed in Chapter 13, it has 
more promise for treating illnesses than any other cannabinoid, including THC. Since it is non-
intoxicant, it has little of the abuse potential of THC (although it can be converted to THC, as noted 
in Chapter 11, there is little practical danger of this being done illicitly). CBD is the chief cannabi-
noid of hemp, which can now be cultivated very cheaply outdoors in most countries. Indeed, CBD 
can be harvested as a “waste product” from the remains of harvesting hempseed. There is a high 
demand for CBD, which currently is being obtained from expensive indoor cultivation, because of 
legal requirements. Common sense dictates that current legal constraints to harvesting CBD from 
hemp should be removed, and the hemp industry permitted to harvest CBD and indeed other non-
intoxicant cannabinoids. Cheaply produced CBD would, however, be disastrous for those who have 
invested in its production from expensive indoor plants.
synthetics
One of the very disturbing aspects of illicit drugs of abuse is synthetic designer drugs, which peri-
odically are introduced, usually with very harmful results (see Chapter 12). Whether harmful or 
benign, the possibility exists that a new drug will capture the public’s attention, diverting interest 
from marijuana, and disappointing those who have invested heavily in it. Synthetic preparations of 
THC, while expensive and often considered to be less effective than conventional marijuana, may 
one day represent competition for C. sativa for medicinal purposes, much like synthetic (artificial) 
vanilla has largely replaced vanilla from the vanilla plant.
GeneticaLLy enGineered Cannabis sativa
Many of the world’s major crops have been genetically engineered, and transformed cultivars are 
becoming increasingly dominant. Genetic engineering is controversial and is a roadblock to mar-
keting in some countries, especially in Europe. Both low-THC (industrial hemp) and high-THC 
(marijuana) forms of C. sativa are symbolically viewed by many as representative of freedom from 
the unreasonable constraints of the power brokers of society, including the international corpora-
tions that now dominate modern agriculture. As noted in Chapter 11, a gene controlling THC syn-
thesis has been transferred to a tissue culture of tobacco, so that if precursors are fed to the culture, 
it will transform them to the acidic form of THC. This suggests that tissue or cell cultures could 
be employed for the biotechnological production of cannabinoids in the future (Sirikantaramas et 
al. 2007; Zirpel et al. 2015). The possibilities of genetically engineering C. sativa go far beyond 
simply producing “Frankenpot”—“super plants” (facetiously illustrated in Figure 15.8) could be 
produced with extraordinary abilities with respect to size, longevity, growth rate, tolerance to 
diseases, pests, climate, soils, odor, taste, and novelty (for example, plants that glow in the dark). 
There have been fears that some of the very high-THC strains now in circulation were generated 
by genetic engineering (Cascini 2012). However, the possibilities of creating novel life forms go 
beyond plants—as noted previously, tissue cultures can be a basis for producing a desired canna-
binoid, and valuable chemicals can also be biotically generated by transformed microorganisms 
 

388
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
such as yeasts in giant vats. The opposition to genetic engineering has been mostly unsuccessful in 
preventing its advance, and it is certain that C. sativa will be transformed, if not already achieved. 
Some crops are now dominated by transformed cultivars, and this has generated winners and 
losers in the marketplace. There would seem to be a strong possibility that this pattern will also 
develop for marijuana.
MARKETPLACE CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO “CHEAP HIGHS”
coMParative costs of Pot and booze
While it may appear indelicate, cost is a major constraint to intoxication. Most people cannot 
afford expensive wines and liquors, and many find that their love (or addiction) for the intoxicant 
of their choice is a major financial drain. The price of cannabis is very low in most countries, 
even by comparison with other illegal drugs (Stockwell et al. 2010). “In producer countries in 
the developing world, it is sometimes cheaper to get ‘high’ on cannabis than it is to get drunk on 
beer” (Leggett 2006). Prices in the United States are comparatively expensive, but nevertheless, 
a casual user can become intoxicated for less than $5.00, which is remarkable when one consid-
ers that black market prices for illegal drugs are highly inflated. Moreover, cannabis is widely 
produced by individuals for their own personal use, cutting down costs. Additionally, marijuana 
is a remarkably social drug, frequently shared, so that some contribute very little to its purchase. 
Because marijuana is so cheap to produce and buy, it suggests that large amounts would have to 
be sold to be profitable, which is probably not a constraint for recreational marijuana (already 
very profitable as a black market commodity). On the other hand, those faced with buying expen-
sive medical marijuana or pharmaceuticals may consider purchasing much less expensive street-
available material.

The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
coexistence of bLack and White Markets
Expensive products sold in the legitimate marketplace are frequently also available illicitly at much 
cheaper prices, as a way of avoiding taxes or license fees, because they are cheaply produced coun-
terfeits or because they are stolen. Governments view legalized marijuana as an opportunity to 
collect large taxes on all aspects of the industry, and the resulting inflated prices are likely to 
incentivize continued existence of the underground economy for cannabis. In the case of marijuana, 
illicit material is supplied both by organized crime on an industrial scale and by small entrepreneurs 
on a cottage industry basis. The illicit trade in alcohol involving moonshine (illegal production of 
high-proof distilled spirits) and bootlegging (illegal transportation or smuggling of alcoholic bever-
ages) provides a parallel example of an intoxicant that is much more expensive legally than illegally. 
Black markets do provide employment and generate economic activity, but the costs in law enforce-
ment and health costs associated with inferior products can be significant. Until cures for dishonesty 
and greed are discovered, the illicit market in marijuana is likely to continue.
ABSENCE OF FOREIGN COMPETITION FOR AUTHORIZED MARIJUANA
Marijuana, as well as many other inebriating drugs, is illicitly transported across borders. Most 
marijuana is in fact a black market commodity, and its geographical production is governed by 
interregional competition. Because herbaceous forms of marijuana are very bulky, odorous, and 
easily detected, most illicit marijuana is locally produced today or at least rarely crosses more than 
one border. In the past, however, the United States was mostly supplied by foreign sources—Mexico 
from the 1930s to the mid-1970s, Colombia during the 1980s, and appreciable importation from 
British Columbia subsequently.
Medical marijuana could in theory be authorized for export and import, but at this time, it rarely 
crosses country borders, except in the European Union; Italy, Finland, Germany, and Switzerland 
import products from the Dutch program. Most states prefer to maintain close control over produc-
tion, quality, and distribution, so medical marijuana is almost entirely produced domestically. The 
possibility exists, however, that in the future, much cheaper foreign production costs could greatly 
alter the advantage to producers of having an exclusively domestic market. Presumably Morocco, 
which has been a significant supplier for Europe, could develop a large legal market for the conti-
nent, and Mexico and the Caribbean could similarly be major suppliers for the United States and 
Canada. At present, there are very large investments in cannabis production underway in developing 
nations, where costs are low, on the speculation that importation into rich Western countries will 
be possible. Transportation costs for bulk herbal materials are appreciable, so imports of high-THC 
preparations, particularly extracts, are likely to be the leading forms of imported marijuana.
CONSUMER TRENDS
At present, vaporizers (allowing smoke-free consumption), concentrates (decreasing the amount of 
material required), and edibles are in high demand in U.S. medical marijuana dispensaries. There 
is developing interest in pharmaceuticals based on particular cannabinoids, particularly the extra-
ordinarily versatile CBD.
MARKET PRODUCTION MODELS: BIG VS. SMALL-SCALE BUSINESSES
A “cottage industry” is a small business managed from a residence, typically a part-time operation 
run by one or two individuals with incomes of less than $100,000. “Small-scale industry” refers to 
operations with limited physical facilities centered in one or a few cities, typically with dozens of 
employees and generating millions of dollars in income. “Big business” operations typically have 
hundreds of employees, often are international, and generate much larger incomes. Illicit marijuana

is currently generated in huge quantities at all three scales: at the cottage industry level, by small-
scale gangs, and by large cartels. What levels of production are appropriately authorized in a legal 
market? Large-scale operations of most commodities have advantages of scale, and the capital and 
resources to ensure quality and safety, but habitually restrict their product range to the most profit-
able items (as do the major beer and liquor companies). Small-scale businesses are well known to 
provide the bulk of business employment and often provide specialty products (as do microbrewer-
ies). Cottage industry production of marijuana is very unlikely to be conducted as safely as regulated 
industries, but is so easy and common that whatever regulations and laws are enacted, it will con-
tinue (legally or not). Governments tend to prefer restricting production to large operations, which 
are much easier to monitor. Over time, one can expect that smaller operations will be authorized, 
especially if costs of authorized products are so high that the black market industry remains large.
MARKET OUTLET FORMATS
There are too few models of legal marijuana distribution to evaluate the comparative impacts, both 
positively and negatively. There is considerable concern that “wild west legalization” and accompa-
nying rampant commercialization may be damaging, and so there is often a belief that public health 
requires tight control of production, distribution sales, and marketing. The following discussion 
examines basic alternatives. Extremely restrictive distribution systems could involve monopolis-
tic “nanny state” or designated corporate control, but various degrees of marketing freedom are 
conceivable.
state MonoPoLy vs. Private sector
Regulated control of production and/or delivery of marijuana could be based primarily or exclu-
sively on (1) government monopoly, either as a designated function of government employees or 
assigned to one private sector company (the jurisdiction could be an entire country or a political 
subdivision); (2) an oligopoly (a market structure in which a few firms dominate), but unlike some 
oligopolies, which also permit many small firms, just a few large firms meeting stringent require-
ments are usually authorized (the current model in Canada); or (3) independent growers and dealers 
on a free market basis, with minimal requisites.
Generally, two basic models are common for herbal medical marijuana dispensation (assuming 
both source and patient are licensed). On the one hand, the firm that produces the material from 
plant to package directly provides it to the patient, either by courier or at a central dispensing clinic. 
On the other, dispensing is by a retailer, which could be as large as a drug store chain or as small 
as an individual physician. Private sector distribution could be restricted to very large suppliers 
(this has been referred to as the “Marlboro-ization of marijuana”) or left to develop in the free mar-
ket, with the result that there will be many small sources. Both the monopolistic and free market 
“The debate over how to legalise cannabis tends to assume that for-profit commercial enter-
prise is the default option. Legalising cannabis on the alcohol model may, however, be the 
second- worst option (behind only continued prohibition); commercialisation creates an industry 
with a strong incentive to promote heavy use and appeal to minors through aggressive market-
ing. No system of legal availability is likely to entirely prevent an increase in problem use. But 
pioneering jurisdictions should consider alternative approaches including non-profit regimes 
and state monopoly. Both sides of the legalisation debate should acknowledge that the ques-
tion is complex and the range of uncertainties wide. Such modesty, alas, is in short supply.”
Kleiman and Ziskind (2014)
 

391
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
alternatives have developed in the Netherlands: pharmaceutical-grade herbal marijuana is available 
from a single state-authorized supplier on a prescription basis, but the widespread acceptance of 
street-available marijuana and its sale in private retail outlets represents a free-market distribution 
system (that is rarely accepted elsewhere in the Western world). Despite the existence of only one 
authorized national medical marijuana supplier in both the Netherlands and the United States, most 
medical marijuana is purchased from other sources in these countries. Until recently, only one 
national medical marijuana supplier was authorized in Canada, and once again, most authorized 
patients purchased their supplies from other sources (mostly small legal growers designated by 
the patients). One cannot avoid noticing that governmental attempts to supply commodities on a 
monopoly basis are rarely competitive with the private sector.
Gettman and Kennedy (2014) argue that production, sale, and marketing of cannabis should be 
left to the free market, with minimal governmental control, because “Marijuana, as a commodity 
for production, has unique attributes that distinguish it from alcohol and tobacco. It is relatively 
easy to grow and does not require industrial processing. Marijuana can be produced anywhere by 
just about anyone. It is grown throughout the country, in backyards, closets, attics, basements, and 
warehouses. While little technology is needed to grow marijuana, ample technology to maximize 
production and yield are widely, legally, available. This is a considerable factor in why prohibition 
has failed to control the production of marijuana. This will also be a considerable factor in the suc-
cess or failure of any alternative regulatory regime.”
“Weed bars”
Once a euphoric substance becomes legalized, public consumption in dedicated dispensing estab-
lishments becomes a possibility. In the Netherlands, perhaps the world’s most permissive country 
with respect to recreational marijuana, supplies can be purchased and consumed in so-called “cof-
fee shops” (more appropriately termed pot cafés or hash bars; Figure 15.9). The prospect that mari-
juana could be similarly consumed in Starbucks-like outlets seems remote at present in most nations

ness of retailing marijuana in the Netherlands. Photo by Bachrach44 (released into the public domain).

but is within the realm of possibility. In most cities, purveyors of cannabis can be expected to be as 
welcome as porn shops, strip joints, and even houses of ill repute. The likelihood is that frequently 
zoning will be similar to that afforded bars, with the possibility of being forbidden near schools, 
churches, and perhaps city centers and tourist areas. Indeed, a study of the placement of dispensa-
ries in California showed that they were located in areas with higher rates of poverty, just outside 
city boundaries, often near alcohol outlets (Morrison et al. 2014). Unfortunately, marijuana-based 
dispensaries may often be confined to the seediest part of town.
Pot restaurants
Weed bars, discussed in the previous paragraph, are rather parallel in nature to conventional bars, 
where food offerings are rarely substantial. Weed bars in the Netherlands are mostly devoted to 
smoking and vaping, not onsite consumption of edibles. However, it may be anticipated that the 
recent growing interest in marijuana edibles may eventually spawn their consumption in dedicated 
premises. Cannabis-infused food, like alcoholic beverages, has a special attraction because it satis-
fies not just a desire for euphoria but also provides the pleasures of taste, odor, and hunger satia-
tion. Coincidentally, both alcohol and cannabis are powerful social lubricants, and so cannabis has 
the potential of displacing some of the usage of alcohol in the hospitality industries. Legalization 
of recreational marijuana, where it has occurred, has been a strong stimulus to an associated pot 
edibles industry, involving mostly common desert items like brownies, sweet beverages, and can-
dies. At present, edibles are being marketed in dispensaries and boutiques, but one can anticipate 
that they may also be offered in restaurants, which could offer THC-laced haute cuisine. Of course, 
just as with alcohol, excessive consumption of cannabis could generate hazards and liabilities when 
customers become excessively “baked.” A difficulty with the idea of consuming cannabis edibles in 
commercial establishments is that the effects from digestion are substantially slower, less predict-
able, and longer-lasting than pulmonary absorption. Eating increases stomach contents, affecting 
the rate of THC assimilation, contributing to the unpredictability of how long and how intensely the 
effects of the THC consumed will persist. Nevertheless, given that restaurant operators and patrons 
have learned how to safely accommodate onsite alcohol consumption, it is conceivable that the same 
may be true for cannabis edibles.
hoMe deLivery (“Weed on WheeLs”)
While the concept may seem odd given the persisting illegality of purchasing marijuana from 
street vendors, there are advantages to services that transport cannabis products to residences on a 
demand basis. In some cities, home delivery of alcohol is available, and apart from the possible issue 
of encouraging alcoholism, this can reduce the incidence of driving under the influence, at least 
for those who remain at the place where the beverages are received. A marijuana edibles delivery 
service, modeled on pizza delivery (Figure 15.10), could be particularly attractive for patients who 
are too debilitated to cook for themselves, combining provision of healthy food (like “meals on 
wheels” programs) in combination with therapeutic cannabis. Indeed, home delivery of pharmaceu-
ticals to those who are house-bound is an established practice, and this model can be followed for 
medical cannabis. In several U.S. states, dispensaries frequently offer a delivery service for medi-
cal marijuana, occasionally under names like “Speed Weed,” “Foggy Daze Delivery Service,” and 
“Your Friendly Neighborhood Drug Dealer.” Indeed, many cannabis-based retail businesses prefer 
to operate exclusively as a mobile service, as this avoids the necessity of establishing a storefront, 
which currently usually is an expensive and cumbersome exercise. Given the stigmatized nature of 
marijuana and its attraction to criminals, home delivery vehicles presumably would best be incon-
spicuous, although some enterprising entrepreneurs may prefer garishly decorated vans. There are 
areas of the United States that have enacted “dry laws” to prevent medical marijuana dispensaries 
from being established, and such “pot deserts” deny ready access to medical cannabis to residents. 
 

393
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
Cannabis delivery services would seem to represent a reasonable compromise, satisfying the wishes 
of local areas to prevent the presence of marijuana retail outlets, while still allowing convenient 
availability. In many areas of the United States, there is considerable legal conflict about what is and 
isn’t permissible with regard to cannabis delivery, and investing in this field will remain somewhat 
hazardous until regulatory policies become established.
ADVERTISING
Advertisers are well aware that promoting their wares in the mass media is not merely a way of 
educating customers, but a determinant of profitability. They are of course not primarily interested 
in public health; rather, the motivation is to maximize profits, build market share, and induce as 
many consumers as possible to purchase the products. Because of the inevitable likelihood that 
unfettered advertising of medical (and even recreational) marijuana will persuade many who should 
not consume the substance, there is strong pressure to prohibit all marijuana advertising. However, 
the Internet is impossible to control completely, and market representatives are highly skilled at 
bringing their company’s products to public attention. There is particular concern regarding how 
marijuana advertising affects adolescents (D’Amico et al. 2015). Limitations on advertising for alco-
hol, tobacco, gambling, and indeed on pharmaceuticals provide guidelines on how marijuana adver-
tising may be constrained in the future. Advertising on medical marijuana dispensation by private 
companies is currently banned in Canada. Advertising for the government-regulated pharmacy sales 
in Uruguay is also banned. Advertising of marijuana in the United States is covered to an uncertain 
extent by federal regulations covering television, the mail, and interstate commerce, and this has 
raised uncertainties about what is occurring in states that have permissive rules. In Colorado and 
Washington, advertising has been relatively unfettered. At the minimum, glossy enlarged photos 
of glistening buds are featured; more provocatively, scantily clad models recline amidst encircling 
plumes of colorful smoke. This is reminiscent of how the tobacco industry “targeted women, chil-
dren, and vulnerable groups by associating smoking with images of freedom, sex appeal, cartoon 
characters, and—in the early days—health benefits” (Richter and Levy 2014).

POTENCY AS A DETERMINANT OF SALES RESTRICTION
Control of production and sales of alcoholic beverages provides an interesting parallel example of 
how an inebriant substance is marketed in relation to concentration. In some jurisdictions, sales of 
high-alcohol beverages are entirely government controlled, while in others, distribution is in the 
hands of the private sector. Of course, there are restrictions based on age and customer sobriety. 
Low-alcohol content (beer, cider, and wine) are sometimes permitted in certain stores (e.g., super-
markets), while high-proof beverages (liquors) are occasionally confined to designated outlets. It 
seems uncertain whether a similar system based on strength of the intoxicating ingredient could 
be devised to separate sales of low-THC herbal marijuana and high-THC hashish. Most stores are 
free to sell dealcoholized or very low-alcohol beverages; conceivably low-THC/high-CBD medical 
marijuana is conceptually similar. (At present, high-CBD hemp, despite lacking genuine intoxicant 
ability, is treated in much of the world as falling under the same laws that govern high-THC mari-
juana.) The most important restriction should deal with purified extracts or synthetic cannabinoids 
(and their precursor chemicals), since concentrated preparations can be especially dangerous. In a 
similar vein, pure alcohol (widely employed for industrial and scientific research) is usually subject 
to rigid licensing and monitoring. There has been consideration given in several countries (notably 
the United Kingdom, Uruguay, and the Netherlands) to having a regulatory framework that consid-
ers the percentage of THC in cannabis (Freeman and Swift 2016), but this has not yet resulted in a 
system of distribution on the basis of potency.
THE AGE OF MAJORITY—A PROBLEMATICAL DETERMINANT 
OF SALES AND CONSUMPTION RESTRICTIONS
Cannabis consumption in numerous places is rampant among children (Chapter 12), and indeed, 
an alarming number of adolescents have become Illicit dealers. In the light of this, it is somewhat 
academic to address the issue of attempting to limit availability to the very young. Nevertheless, the 
issue is of considerable importance.
The “age of majority,” indicative of transition from legal minor status to adulthood, generally 
varies from 18 to 21. As noted in Chapters 12 and 13, the greatest harm potential of cannabis appears 
to be consumption by the young, defined as ranging up to 25 years of age. Because a proportion of 
young people between the conventional age of majority and 25 years seem significantly susceptible 
to brain impairment from cannabis usage, the minimum age for legal consumption is problemati-
cal. As with other privileges accompanying the age of majority, young people are eager to take full 
advantage of their legal status, and it is very difficult to conceive that they would accept restrictions 
to the ripe old age of 25 insofar as recreational cannabis is concerned. However, the medical profes-
sion needs to take account of the relative inadvisability of utilization until this age is reached.
LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
cautions
Production, distribution, and usage of marijuana are governed by different legislations according 
to region, and indeed, policies are evolving rapidly. For the possible development of medical and/
or recreational marijuana, it is important to appreciate the legal status of marijuana locally. In 
some countries (notably Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Singapore, and United Arab Emirates), penalties 
are severe, especially for trafficking, and may include death. Many countries (including Canada, 
Denmark, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States) allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes. The precise regulations governing can-
nabis in areas where it is currently authorized are often complex and often periodically undergo 
changes. Authorization to produce, prescribe, sell, and employ medical marijuana (occasionally 
 

395
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
also recreational cannabis) differ considerably depending on political region. As with other complex 
laws and regulations governing substances and activities that are subject to extreme penalties, even 
when transgressions occur innocently, it is sometimes too easy to run afoul of requirements or to 
be accused of such. Accordingly, anyone entering into business aspects related to marijuana needs 
to be thoroughly aware of the rules and to understand potential pitfalls. It is probably also true that 
given the possible danger of accidental exposure to legal prosecution (to say nothing of the hazards 
from the criminal element), engaging in the developing marijuana commerce requires courage.
“Compassion clubs” providing marijuana to sick people have often run afoul of the law, and 
those selling marijuana in for-profit establishments need to be particularly cautious because they 
will not be viewed as sympathetically. “Pot speakeasies” are regularly established by brave (or 
foolish) entrepreneurs, testing the tolerance of the police and local government. Frequent tactics of 
such ventures include claims that the establishment is a “club” or “clinic” not subject to local regula-
tions. Often, customers are required to sign long waivers absolving the business of health and legal 
consequences. Such testing of the boundaries of current laws governing cannabis reflects not only 
uncertainties about the tolerances of society and the political system but also a conviction that the 
future will be considerably more permissive.
internationaL treaties
At the beginning of the twentieth century, international conferences concerned with the damage 
associated with opium use laid the groundwork for later international sanctions against harmful 
plant-based drugs (Mead 2014). More than a dozen international agreements dealing with psychoac-
tive substances were signed. These were combined in the United Nations Single Convention Treaty 
on Narcotic Drugs of 1961. This obligated signing countries to enact controls on cannabis, while 
allowing certain activities to proceed with restrictions. Cannabis and its products were defined as 
“narcotics with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medicinal value.” THC was not character-
ized until 1964, so early legislation did not use it as a legal criterion. The laws that countries agreed 
to establish were subsequently modified by two international treaties: the 1971 U.N. Convention on 
Psychotropic Substances and the 1988 U.N. Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances. The agreements require countries that are signatories to prohibit numer-
ous activities concerned with marijuana and its constituents but allow exceptions, particularly for 
medical purposes. Just how much discretion individual countries may exercise in these respects has 
been argued (Mead 2014). Room (2014) states that, while medical use is allowed under the conven-
tions, legalization of recreational marijuana (as in Uruguay and the states of Alaska, Colorado, 
Oregon, and Washington) contravenes the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as well as 
the 1988 Convention. Room concluded that “The world is now saddled with drug treaties which are 
not fit for purpose.” Leggett (2006) noted that “Signatories to a range of international drug control 
treaties have agreed that cannabis should be deemed an illicit drug. Despite these agreements, many 
States have, in various ways, relaxed their controls over cannabis. Even where these changes do not 
amount to a breach of the treaties, there appears to be a divergence in spirit between international 
agreements and individual State action. This discontinuity has not been addressed at an interna-
tional level and thus international efforts to address cannabis have also fallen by the wayside.” 
Rodman (2015) discusses the need for reform of the United Nations treaties dealing with cannabis.
LEGAL MODELS
the netherLands
The Netherlands, for several decades the center of economic development of high-THC cannabis, 
is uniquely permissive with respect to marijuana. Beginning in 1976, penalties for cannabis were 
softened, and eventually retail outlets euphemistically termed “coffee shops” were allowed to sell 
 

396
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
small amounts of marijuana. Although cultivation and supply are technically limited to a national 
supplier and usage to prescriptions, enforcement is nominal or weak, and the situation has been 
described as “de facto legalization.”
united states
The United States is not only the world’s largest consumer of herbal marijuana, it is also highly 
influential in establishing public policies in the Western world. “Since the 1970s, the national trend 
has moved toward decriminalization, increased social acceptance, and legalization for medical use. 
Today, more than half the states in the United States have decriminalized the possession of small 
amounts of marijuana, approved it for medical use, or legalized it completely. Numerous other 
states—both liberal and conservative—are considering legalization, indicating that the recreational 
use of marijuana is no longer a partisan issue” (Hickenlooper 2014). Although the federal U.S. 
government still prohibits marijuana, it has not blocked states from legalizing it for medical or 
recreational purposes, provided that a number of conditions are met (such as preventing distribu-
tion to minors and not allowing diversion to states where marijuana is still illegal). The states of 
Washington and Colorado legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2012, authorizing com-
mercial cultivation, processing, and sales to adults, who are allowed to possess up to 1 ounce (28 g) 
for personal use. In Colorado, up to six plants can be cultivated by individuals. California’s lack of 
appreciable restrictions on medical marijuana has been said to represent de facto legalization for 
recreational purposes.
uruGuay
Uruguay became the first country to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in 2014. Individuals 
can purchase up to 40 g/month from registered pharmacies, cultivate up to six plants producing up 
to 480 g annually, or join a club that has the same personal limits.
other countries
Recreational usage is prohibited by law in almost all Western countries. Medical usage is permit-
ted in many countries, generally with strict conditions. In some cases, there is just one authorized 
supplier, the government itself or a designated private company. In other cases, there are private 
sector suppliers. Some countries like Spain allow organizations (“clubs”) to dispense marijuana to 
its membership. Sometimes, individuals are authorized to cultivate a small personal supply.
PATENTS
An “invention” is “a new product or process that solves a technical problem” (WIPO 2010). Some 
inventions are improvements on previous solutions. Patents are exclusive rights granted for inven-
tions. Patents are provided by governments, giving inventors rights over copying, using, distribut-
ing, or selling their inventions, for a specific period (typically 20 years). Before a patent is issued, 
an inventor must provide convincing evidence that the new invention is (1) useful, (2) novel, and 
(3) not so obvious that others could have easily deduced it. Inventions are a major part of “intellectual 
property,” but to be profitably commercial, other aspects of intellectual property such as copyright, 
trademarks, and industrial design are often required. Because marijuana has been used for thou-
sands of years, it is often difficult to discern when a given form or process employed to produce it 
is patentable.
There have been several patents relating to the biochemistry of the cannabinoids. Especially 
interesting is Patent 6630507: Cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants, filed by the U.S. 
government in 1999, rather ironically since at the time, it vehemently opposed cannabis and viewed 
 

397
The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
it as a substance utterly without medical value. The patent was based on findings of Aiden Hampson 
and Julius Axelrod (a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist), who discovered that CBD showed prom-
ise in limiting neurological damage in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease 
and in those who have suffered a stroke or head trauma (Barcott and Scherer 2015).
In Chapter 12, considerable information was provided on the production of resin powder, a high-
THC form of cannabis. Equipment for production of cannabis resin powder traces to (1) ancient 
techniques and apparatus that evolved in Asia during past centuries, (2) techniques and apparatus 
invented during the past half century in the drug subculture of Western countries, and (3) tech-
niques and apparatus invented during recent decades by merchants servicing the drug subculture 
of Western countries. Because the technology and apparatus developed for the preparation of can-
nabis resin powder were invented largely in the counterculture and indeed often constitutes “drug 
paraphernalia,” intellectual claims are problematical. There are conflicting patent claims as to who 
invented and/or adapted apparatus and techniques for wet and dry sieving production of purified, 
high-THC preparations of the secretory glands (these two basic classes were described in Chapter 12). 
The techniques and apparatus (or at least similar apparatus) may have been used for decades, per-
haps even for centuries. Moreover, the intellectual property issue is uncertain because the equip-
ment and techniques have been largely utilized in an illegal or at least legally problematical setting. 
Mila Jansen of the Netherlands and the company she established have been particularly significant 
sources of equipment for production of cannabis resin powder (Jansen and Teris 2002).
A variety of modalities for administering cannabinoids are available or may be produced in 
the future. Commercial utilization of equipment and techniques to produce authorized cannabis 
preparations needs to consider the potentially problematical nature of intellectual property claims.
The added-value potential of proprietary drug derivatives of the cannabinoids and drug-delivery 
systems is huge. The British firm GW Pharmaceuticals has been very active in the development of 
cannabis technologies, both extracts and in herbal forms, which are advertised as providing the con-
sumer with a more efficient delivery system (more THC, less tar, etc.) and therefore greater safety. 
Other firms as well are researching cannabinoid delivery systems. The long-term significance of 
such patented technological developments, which could make obsolete the use of medicinal mari-
juana as currently supplied, needs to be examined.
As described in Chapter 13, noncannabinoid compounds that are naturally in herbal marijuana, 
particularly terpenes and flavonoids, may augment the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids. In prin-
cipal, there is no reason to restrict the composition of a marijuana-based formulation to compounds 
that are naturally in the plant, and one can foresee the marketing of imaginative combinations of 
ingredients. Moreover, just as the tobacco industry has marketed cigarettes with flavorants, humec-
tants, and other materials to improve organoleptic qualities, one can foresee the same for marijuana. 
The extent to which given formulations constitute intellectual property may be open to debate.
There are numerous cultivars or biotypes of crops that have been created through genetic engi-
neering, and the documentation of the genome of C. sativa (Van Bakel et al. 2011) stimulated inter-
est in exploiting its genes. Russo (2011b) commented: “It is certain that the production of genetically 
modified organism (GMO) cannabis plants would provoke tremendous controversy among consum-
ers, and that battles over patents and breeding rights would be obvious sequelae of such a devel-
opment. Any individual or corporation anticipating dipping their toes into such an endeavor may 
expect to encounter a veritable regulatory minefield while attempting to license such a product.”
OPIUM POPPY AS A BUSINESS MODEL FOR MARIJUANA PRODUCTION
Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) provides an instructive example of how the world has made 
compromises in order to grow a plant for both drug and nondrug products (Small 2010). Reminiscent 
of how C. sativa has been altered by humans into three different categories of plant (fiber, oilseed 
and drugs), so P. somniferum has been domesticated into three different groups of plants: drug 
cultivars, oilseed/condiment cultivars, and ornamentals. Most people are unaware that the source 
 

398
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
of poppy seeds commonly used on bakery products is the opium poppy, exactly the same species 
that produces opiate drugs such as heroin. Indeed, the very same plants are often the source of both 
condiments and drugs. As noted in the following, most people are also unaware that ornamental 
poppies, often cultivated on their property, are frequently opium poppies, and that opium poppy 
grows wild in numerous areas.
Like C. sativa, the opium poppy has become established as a weed throughout much of the world. 
The species is believed to grow wild in the Mediterranean region, from the Canary Isles eastward, 
but is found as an escape from cultivation in fields, roadsides, and waste places in scattered localities 
almost everywhere, including North America. However, unlike governmental attempts to eradicate 
wild “ditchweed,” there have not been any significant efforts to exterminate the wild-growing poppies.
While millions have been prosecuted for cultivation or possession of marijuana forms of 
C. sativa, almost no one has run afoul of the law because they grow ornamental opium poppies. Opium 
poppy seeds for growing the plants are widely available in stores and from seed supply firms, but 
dealers are virtually never charged with traffic in narcotics. As noted in the next paragraph, orna-
mental opium poppies do not have as high a potential for harm as do selected drug strains, but they 
still do possess opiate constituents. The tolerance for opium poppy cultivation exhibited by society 
in general and law enforcement in particular stands in stark contradiction to the intolerance of can-
nabis cultivation. It demonstrates that the mere cultivation of potentially dangerous drug plants is 
not necessarily dangerous.
However, it cannot be disputed that some plant-derived drug substances are dangerous, and in 
the history of human civilization, opium has been the most evil (Figure 15.11). Crude opium is typi-
cally just the hardened latex (milky sap) of the unripe fruit (capsule) of the opium poppy. Opium 
contains a mixture of many constituents, including the alkaloids morphine and codeine. Morphine 
is normally the most abundant alkaloid present in opium. Opium has traditionally been obtained by 
making incisions into the nearly ripe poppy capsules 10–20 days after flowering. In cooler climates, 
incisions do not seem to result in good exudation of latex, and mature capsules are simply collected 
for chemical extraction. Morphine is often extracted from the capsules of oilseed cultivars after 
the seeds have been harvested, although drug cultivars are more productive. The capsules of some 
ornamental forms of opium poppy have less than 1% opiate alkaloids, while those of drug cultivars

The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
can have more than 20%. The opium of some selected pharmacological varieties is more than 25% 
by dry weight.
Opiate alkaloids are harvested from cultivated opium poppies for medicinal use (Figure 15.12) as 
well as for illicit narcotics. As a source of drugs of abuse, the opium poppy has caused more human 
pain than any other plant, but as a source of medicines, it has relieved more human pain than any 
other plant. Morphine is considered to be the most important analgesic used for severe pain. While 
it is the premier medication for agonizing pain and suffering, it has high potential for addiction, and 
so it is strongly regulated. Heroin, which is produced by chemical conversion of morphine, acts rela-
tively rapidly to produce euphoria and is a chief illegal drug of abuse. The widely used pain reliever 
codeine is also produced by chemical conversion from morphine.
Just as it is possible to cultivate low-THC “industrial hemp” cultivars that have virtually no abuse 
potential, it is possible to grow poppy cultivars for certain medicinally important opiate alkaloids 
that have very limited potential of abuse. Some selected varieties of the opium poppy produce 
opium with virtually no morphine. Opium poppies that do not produce morphine are considered to 
be much less dangerous and in some jurisdictions are allowed to be cultivated with relatively limited 
oversight. Some varieties of the thebaine poppy (also known as Iranian poppy and scarlet poppy), 
Papaver bracteatum Lindl., can produce appreciable morphine, but this poppy has generally been 
cultivated for the production of two other alkaloids, codeine and thebaine. Some varieties of this 
species have low amounts of morphine and almost the only opiate alkaloid present is the nonnar-
cotic thebaine. As with low-morphine opium poppy, thebaine poppies are allowed to be grown in 
some jurisdictions where the cultivation of normal opium poppy is forbidden or allowed only under 
stringent conditions. Because the chief commercial product of opium poppies is codeine (as noted 
previously, produced by chemical conversion from morphine), the thebaine poppy has been con-
sidered to be a desirable substitute for the much more dangerous opium poppy (thebaine can also 
be easily converted to codeine). Thebaine poppy is increasingly being grown in Western countries.
Medicinal poppies are grown outdoors, not in glass houses. There are several advantages to 
growing plants indoors, especially medicinal plants; nevertheless, not only poppies but also almost 
all other cultivated medicinal plants (indeed, almost all crops) are in fact grown outside because it 
is very much cheaper to do so. Indeed, the only critical reason to produce cannabis indoors is for 
security. In the long-term, the fear of cannabis that still dictates most policies concerning its pro-
duction is likely to lessen to the point that medicinal C. sativa will be grown mostly outdoors, as 
nature intended.

Viewed in the context of developing C. sativa, the opium poppy industry demonstrates that even 
dangerously addictive species can be managed for the good of society by enactment of sensible 
policies.
LAUGHING GAS AS A BUSINESS MODEL FOR MARIJUANA PRODUCTION
Laughing gas (nitrous oxide, N2O) is a well-known, respected anesthetic and analgesic in surgery 
and dentistry. It is often employed as an oxidizer in rocket and racing car fuels. It is also used as 
an aerosol spray propellant, such as in whipped cream canisters and cooking sprays. Beginning 
in the nineteenth century in Britain, laughing gas became a party drug (Figure 15.13), and it is 
still employed recreationally to produce a pleasant giddiness and orgasm-like euphoria (Lynn et 
al. 1972), effects related to its opiate-like abilities (Gillman and Lichtigfeld 1994). Depending on 
jurisdiction, laughing gas is unregulated or somewhat regulated (for example, availability may be 
restricted to adults or to licensed professionals). Nonmedical use is occasionally subject to legal 
FIGURE 15.13 Prints (public domain) showing the recreational usage of laughing gas. Top: A satirical 
picture (published in 1830) of chemist Sir Humphrey Davy administering laughing gas to a woman. Davy

American-born British physicist and inventor. Bottom: A view of a laughing gas party in a doctor’s office (pub-

penalties but is rarely treated seriously. There is a general consensus that the harm potential of 
nitrous oxide is limited (at least directly to people; this greenhouse gas is thought to be a significant 
contributor to atmospheric pollution).
Comparing laughing gas to marijuana may appear to be a stretch, since nitrous oxide is accepted 
as a valuable medical material with limited recreational harm potential. However, Myles et al. 
(2007) indicate that it has been found to have some deleterious effects after surgery, and Cousaert 
et al. (2013) point out that laughing gas is one of the commonest inhalant drugs of abuse among the 
young. Breathing in pure nitrous oxide has led to death by oxygen deprivation (Zuck et al. 2012). In 
any event, laughing gas has been tested as a freely available substance in the public marketplace for 
over two centuries, while marijuana has almost universally been subject to extremely severe restric-
tions. It is at least conceivable that in the long-term, marijuana will be as normalized a business 
commodity as laughing gas.
THE GREAT IRONY: FROM COUNTERCULTURE DRUG 
TO MASS-MARKETED COMMODITY
The Hippie (hippy) subculture, which championed the huge expansion of marijuana during the mid-
1960s and 1970s in the United States and eventually in much of the world, was a countercultural 
movement that defiantly rejected the mores of mainstream American life. In essence, smoking mari-
juana symbolized repudiation of capitalism, conventional values, and state-mandated regulation 
of pleasurable drugs. Many of the same idealistic rebellious youth who once espoused a life free 
of greed and hard work have been transformed into money-grubbing cannabis entrepreneurs with 
MBAs, firmly rooted in the profit-based establishment they once despised (Figure 15.14). Today, 
marijuana is becoming one of capitalism’s most promisingly lucrative developments, and mari-
juana is increasingly being defended (albeit with reservations) by physicians, politicians, and even 
police—the most conservative professions of society.
THE CANNABIS ROADS TO HEAVEN AND HELL
the Precautionary PrinciPLe in reLation to coMMerciaL deveLoPMent of cannabis
As discussed in Chapter 13, the “precautionary principle” is a respected way of managing the sus-
pected risk(s) of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific con-
sensus that the action or policy is not harmful. This approach places the burden of proof that the 
issue under consideration is not harmful on those advocating or tolerating the activity in question. 
FIGURE 15.14 Transformation of the idealistic hippie generation to capitalism. Prepared by B. Flahey.
 

402
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
The precautionary principle has been cited as a justification for the prohibition of recreational drugs, 
including marijuana. In its extreme application, the precautionary principle leads to reluctance to 
alter the regulatory status quo. However, societal demand for change in the status of cannabis has 
developed such momentum that inaction is no longer a choice. Prohibition of alcohol consumption 
in the United States, followed by widespread scofflaw contravention, a tidal wave of protest, and 
eventual political reacceptance of booze, is eerily analogous to what is happening with respect to 
marijuana.
Historically, commerce has been conducted with considerable freedom, with limitations imposed 
only after significantly deleterious results become evident from a product or practice. In effect, busi-
ness activities have been considered innocent until proven guilty, a situation that can be catastrophic 
when a product becomes extremely popular but proves to be dangerously defective (as evidenced 
by recent massive recalls of automobiles). It seems certain that legalized marijuana will become 
extremely popular (indeed, exceeding the popularity of illegal marijuana), and given the consensus 
that marijuana is not risk-free, there is evident need for caution in formulating new regulations.
reasonabLe reGuLatory risk ManaGeMent
Fundamental innovations and changes that affect many people almost invariably have unintended 
results, and there is always concern about negative spinoff. Governments are responsible for enact-
ing wise regulatory landscapes maximizing the availability of safe, effective products while con-
trolling abuse potential with constraints that are acceptable to the majority of society. Income from 
taxes, stimulation of employment, and control of health costs are chief governance considerations. 
The models of control of production, sale, and consumption of cannabis products outlined in this 
chapter are currently being tested in various jurisdictions, and the comparative risks and benefits 
of these frameworks are not yet clear. The natural tendency of governments is to retain centralized 
control of production and distribution, but governmental constraints inevitably seem to inflate costs, 
and this is certain to encourage a substantial black market distributing cheaper but unsafe material. 
It is essential that, over time, regulatory frameworks evolve and adapt, presumably becoming more 
permissive, as experience dictates.
Private sector business has thrived throughout history, and where there has been an unquench-
able demand, it has always been met, legally or not. Capitalism best serves society when restraints 
are minimal, but sufficient, to minimize abuse and harm. Unfortunately, free-market capitalism, by 
its nature, cannot be relied on, either to proactively address health and safety issues or to redress 
negative developments. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that leadership within the business communi-
ties will exercise the caution and responsibility necessary to minimize the problems that will occur.
It is impossible to predict with certainly whether the present momentum popularizing both 
medical and recreational marijuana will continue. The degree and manner of the future availabil-
ity of cannabis ultimately are matters for society to constrain through its democratic institutions. 
Nevertheless, marijuana seems destined to become an important medication, for the betterment of 
mankind, and a legal social inebriant for the masses, for better or worse. The commercial prospects 
of both medical and recreational cannabis appear to be extraordinarily profitable both for the pri-
vate and public sectors.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• In 1996, the Adidas shoe company introduced the “hemp shoe,” a model with the upper 
portion made of hemp (Figure 15.15). The U.S. White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy severely criticized the company and asked it to withdraw the shoe from 
the marketplace. In denying the request, Adidas president Steve Wynne replied, “I don’t 
believe you will encounter anyone smoking our shoes any time soon.”

The Commercial Marijuana Revolution
• During Japan’s feudal era, merchants carried gold, silver, copper, and iron coins with 
square holes in the centre so that they could be carried on strings of hemp.
• In colonial America, citizens of several colonies were required by law to grow hemp. In 
1682, the Virginia legislature made hemp fiber legal tender for up to one-quarter of all 
debts. Similar laws were enacted in Maryland in 1683 and Pennsylvania in 1706. By 1810, 
hemp was Kentucky’s major crop and was also used as money.
• American presidents George Washington (1732–1799) and Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) 
encouraged the growing of hemp. However, both lost money trying to grow the crop.
• The “Goldilocks price” for marijuana is a compromise that governments legislating can-
nabis sales need to consider. (The “Goldilocks principle” states that something should fall 
within certain margins, neither too large nor too small.) The price should not be too low (to 
avoid spurring consumption), nor too high (to undercut the black market).
• In Morocco, “the amount of land area dedicated to producing one gram of hashish is at 
least 25 times greater than that needed to produce one gram of cannabis herb outdoors” 
(Leggett 2006). While there is value added in such production, because of the extensive 
labor and processing involved, the profit margin is much too small to justify producing 
hashish rather than herbal marijuana. It appears that tradition and a reliable demand for 
Moroccan hashish in Europe is responsible for continuation of the hashish trade, despite 
this not making economic sense.
• In 2014, what has alleged to be the first medicinal marijuana-related TV ad (from 
MarijuanaDoctors.com) aired on Comcast-owned channels such as Fox, CNN, ESPN, 
Comedy Central, AMC, and Discovery in Chicago and New Jersey (viewable at http://
www.brandingmagazine.com/2014/03/05/worlds-first-major-medicinal-marijuana-tv-ad/).
• One of the most effective of modern marketing techniques is to associate a product with 
a famous personality known to be associated with it. Legendary singer-songwriter Willie 
Nelson is a longtime proponent and enthusiast of marijuana, perhaps only secondary to 
comedy duo Richard “Cheech” Marin and Tommy Chong. In 2014, Nelson announced 
plans to produce his own brand of marijuana (“Willie’s Reserve”) and to establish a chain 
of dispensaries.

• Another example of the brand power of a famous name is provided by Jamaican reggae 
icon Bob Marley (Figure 15.16), who was a vocal advocate of marijuana before his death in 
1981. In 2014, Privateer Holdings, a New York equity firm investing in the legal cannabis 
industry, acquired the rights from the Marley family to use his name to label a variety of 
products, including “heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains.” According to Forbes’ annual 
list of dead celebrities’ earnings, in 2014, Marley was the ninth highest paid dead celebrity, 
making $20 million, more than Marilyn Monroe or John Lennon. Since cannabis is illegal 
federally in the United States, there could be problems in registering a brand name associ-
ated with prohibited usages.

16 Sustainability
“Sustainable” has become the byword for human long-term utilization of physical and energy 
resources in ways that do not degrade living things, habitats, ecosystems, and planetary resources 
such as the atmosphere, water, soil, and landscapes. Unsustainable agriculture, mostly related to 
crops, is the principal way that people harm the world. The cannabis plant has quite extraordinary 
significance in mankind’s current attempts to create a more sustainable world, and this chapter deals 
with the considerations that make it useful in many respects for increasing sustainability, although 
less so in other ways.
THE REPUTATION OF THE CANNABIS PLANT FOR SUSTAINABILITY
For several decades, industrial varieties of Cannabis sativa have been touted as phenomenally 
beneficial for the environment and biodiversity, admittedly particularly by individuals some-
times considered to be “Fringe Greenies” by those with limited sympathy for environmental 
issues. Nevertheless, hemp has become the world’s leading crop symbol of sustainable agriculture. 
Although the benefits of growing hemp have been greatly exaggerated in the popular press and by 
hemp entrepreneurs, C. sativa is nevertheless exceptionally suitable for organic agriculture and is 
remarkably less “ecotoxic” in comparison to most other crops. There are considerable ecological 
and sustainable advantages, as presented in this chapter, but there are also some disadvantages, 
particularly with respect to the illicit cultivation of marijuana.
HOW MAJOR CROPS HARM THE WORLD AND WHY 
CANNABIS SATIVA CAN BE BENEFICIAL
Humans have modified plants since the beginnings of agriculture about 13,000 years ago, so that 
they will be more useful and productive. Such modification has almost invariably weakened the 
resistance of the plants against stresses, necessitating protective measures. Crops are particularly 
affected by biotic stresses from “pests” in the broad sense, including animals (especially insects, 
slugs and snails, mites, nematodes, rodents, and birds), plant pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and 
fungi), and weeds. These diminish crop growth and deteriorate stored harvests, reducing produc-
tivity by as much as 40% (Flood 2010). Measures to compete against harmful organisms have 
resulted in the widespread use of pesticides, which have been very harmful to the natural world. 
In parallel, measures to compensate for such abiotic stresses as soil infertility and lack of moisture 
have resulted in the massive use of fertilizers and the profligate consumption of water. Invariably, 
mechanized or factory agriculture today uses huge amounts of fossil fuels. All of these strategies 
have drastically deteriorated the landscape and atmosphere of the world. Crops that minimize 
“agricultural inputs” (pesticides, irrigation, energy) can contribute substantially to reducing eco-
logical damage.
Agriculture today is dominated by about a dozen major crops grown as huge monocultures, i.e., 
as continuous plantations with just a single species. The huge expenditures of water, herbicides, 
pesticides, fungicides, bactericides, fertilizer, and fossil fuels result in chemical pollution of soil, 
water, and the atmosphere and displacement or destruction of native animals, plants, and soil organ-
isms. Fortunately, it is possible to find less ecologically damaging crops, and C. sativa is extremely 
promising in this regard, as discussed in this chapter.

406
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
Simply adding a new crop, like C. sativa, to those being grown can be beneficial. The topic 
of “crop diversification” deals with the addition of crops to those currently cultivated in a region. 
There may be economic benefits (such as increased profitability, new markets, and cushioning 
the effects of crop and market failures of the crops that have been grown), but there are also 
possible ecological benefits. Growing many crops (although in some respects less efficient than 
dependence on a small number of major monocultures) can lessen the attractiveness of farms to 
pests and diseases and may even provide niches for some wildlife. However, some crops are more 
beneficial than others to the natural world, and, as noted later in the chapter, hemp is remarkably 
advantageous.

of C. sativa were found to be exceptionally compatible with the environment. Illicit drug forms 
were less friendly to nature, but as described later, this is because of the practices of irresponsible 
growers.
BIOCIDE REDUCTION
Agriculture makes heavy use of biocides (pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides), which can be 
extremely detrimental to biodiversity. Although conscientious attempts are generally made to local-
ize application, accidental drift of biocides can be harmful to nontargeted organisms (for exam-
ple, fish in nearby streams) and soil organisms (such as earthworms) near the area of application. 
Innocent resident animals and plants often cannot escape exposure, nor can visiting pollinators, 
birds, and other foragers. Toxic biocides threaten the survival of some species and sometimes even 
poison humans. Although various techniques (most importantly organic agriculture, integrated pest 
management [IPM], and genetic engineering) offer means of decreasing biocide use, most crops are 
dependent on heavy application of biocides, particularly pesticides and herbicides. Crops that are 
naturally resistant to pests and weeds are therefore very important in reducing damage to biodiver-
sity. Cannabis sativa is known to be significantly resistant to most harmful organisms and rarely 
requires protective treatment. Indeed, the most valid claims for the environmental friendliness of 
hemp relate to its very limited need for agricultural biocides.
Fields intended for hemp cultivation are still conventionally cleared of weeds using herbicides, 
but so long as hemp is thickly seeded (as is always done when it is grown for fiber), the rapidly 
developing young plants normally shade out competing weeds that appear subsequently. Young, 
growing plants that are more widely spaced (as is typically done for production of hempseed and 
marijuana) are less able to smother out weeds and may require mechanized weeding, which is 
wasteful of fuel.
Cannabis sativa is remarkably resistant to insects (Figure 16.2). However, the degree of immu-
nity to attacking organisms has been greatly exaggerated, with several insects and fungi special-
izing on hemp. In very damp (e.g., maritime) environments, fungi can cause severe damage (Van 
der Werf et al. 1996), and should the plant become much more widely cultivated than at present, it is 
likely that significant pest problems will develop. Nevertheless, the use of pesticides and fungicides 
on hemp is usually unnecessary, although introduction of C. sativa to regions where it has not been 
grown for many years should be expected to attract pests.
FIGURE 16.2 Grasshopper on hemp. Grasshoppers and their orthopteran relatives (crickets and locusts) 
rarely damage the foliage of C. sativa. Indeed, few insects significantly harm the species, so the use of insec-
ticides is very rarely required.
 

408

USING UP SURPLUS MANURE
As discussed in Chapter 3, C. sativa is naturally adapted to soils where animal excrement has 
accumulated—i.e., sites with considerable nitrogen. Although the weedy form of the species is 
known to be capable of surviving on poor soils with limited nitrogen, to maximize production, 
input of fertilizer high in the element is needed. Hemp is extraordinarily well adapted to the use of 
manure as a nitrogen source. Unfortunately, most hemp is grown using conventional synthetic fertil-
izers, which are environmentally damaging. Livestock production inevitably produces large stores 
of manure, and C. sativa has the potential of using up these surpluses. Properly managed, manure 
can be far friendlier to the environment than synthetic fertilizers, which (1) require the expenditure 
of fossil fuels to manufacture, (2) reduce soil organism biodiversity, (3) tend to be overused, result-
ing in eutrophication (overfertilization) of waterways, and (4) produce significant amounts of atmo-
spheric pollutants and greenhouse gases. (Runoff from manure can be as damaging to biodiversity 
as runoff from inorganic fertilizers, so that the use of manure is not problem-free.)
MISCELLANEOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGES
There is widespread concern over the depleting supply of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, peat), as well 
as the environmental degradation associated with transporting them (such as caused by oil tanker 
spills), and the atmospheric pollution generated from burning them. As discussed in Chapter 10, 
C. sativa is a candidate for biomass production. Plants that generate biomass can be used as ethanol 
fuel sources, and in some cases, this may alleviate problems associated with the use of fossil fuels. 
However, at this time, the prospects for C. sativa in this regard seem limited, mostly because the 
technology for transforming cellulosic plant tissues to fuel alcohol is expensive. As discussed in 
Chapter 8, the species is also a candidate for biodiesel production. Casas et al. (2005) analyzed the 
life cycle value and carbon economy of hemp biodiesel but did not find clear environmental benefits. 
Similarly, Van der Werf (2004) concluded that hemp was comparable to wheat and sugar beet with 
respect to relative contributions of polluting substances emitted to the atmosphere and resources 
employed. Although the price of hemp oil is too expensive at present for it to be used as biodiesel, 
this is a possibility in the future (Figure 16.3).
Drug and oilseed types of C. sativa (to a much lesser extent, fiber cultivars) are very high value 
crops in terms of productivity per unit area. Such crops tend to increase local wealth and indirectly

decrease pressure on the environment and habitats since a smaller acreage needs to be farmed to 
produce a reasonable income.
Like most crops, at least while they are growing, Cannabis can reduce the supply of weed seeds 
in the soil (since an established crop outcompetes weeds), control soil erosion, and aerate the soil.
The deep roots of Cannabis are efficient at water uptake from lower soil levels, which may be 
ecologically desirable in some circumstances. For example, crops with shallow roots can exacerbate 
salinization of soils by bringing salt from shallow layers to the surface, but deeper-rooted plants 
can sometimes avoid this difficulty. Also, where water is only available at depth, its utilization from 
deeper parts of the soil can prevent excessive drying of the surface of the soil.
ENVIRONMENTAL DISADVANTAGES
As with almost all crops, there are significant environmental impacts associated with growing 
C. sativa (Van der Werf and Turunen 2008).
Where natural rainfall is limited, C. sativa must have moderate irrigation to be productive, espe-
cially during early growth. Irrigation can greatly alter ecosystems and is especially detrimental to 
indigenous plant species that are adapted to dry areas. Accordingly, irrigation is a key consideration 
of the extent to which a crop can be considered environmentally friendly. Agriculture is respon-
sible for 70% of the world’s fresh water consumption (Heywood 1996), and chronic shortages are 
developing in many countries, so the need for irrigation is a significant limitation. Indirect harmful 
effects of irrigation include possible soil salinization and pollution from run-off.
Current market forces tend to pressure farmers to narrow the diversity of crops and livestock 
produced. Modern agriculture and plantation forestry are highly productive but constitute artificial, 
low-diversity ecosystems. Today, much of the world is occupied by vast monocultures, particularly 
cereals (notably wheat, barley, oats, rice, corn, millets, and sorghum), which are so very highly 
domesticated that they require heavy inputs of energy and agrochemicals and are therefore rather 
environmentally unfriendly. Also, such systems are very susceptible to climate variations and out-
breaks of pests and pathogens. Large monocultures, by their nature, exterminate local habitats and 
their constituent wild species. Industrial hemp (for fiber and oilseed) is most efficiently grown as a 
large-scale monocrop, and so it tends to add to the environmental burden in the same way as other 
large field crops.
Agriculture is a heavy user of fossil fuels for tilling, planting, harvesting, and processing. Such 
consumption generates atmospheric gases contributing to climate change. Cannabis sativa does 
not have advantages in most of these respects by comparison with other crops. Textile crops (as 
exemplified by fiber hemp) and oilseed crops (such as oilseed hemp) are associated with exten-
sive extraction and processing machinery, which in turn necessitate mined resources, including 
fuels. Hemp oil can be prone to rancidity, requiring refrigeration to prolong quality, which requires 
energy. However, much of the energy expenditure of agriculture is concerned with the manufacture 
and application of herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, and chemical fertilizers. As noted previously, 
Cannabis crops require lower use of these agrochemicals than most other crops, and this factor 
tends to lower overall energy consumption costs. As noted later, several products made with hemp 
(such as insulation and hemp-lime concrete) contribute to conservation of energy, and some hemp 
products simply require less energy to make, or to transport (because they are light).
Minimum tillage, the practice of planting seeds or seedlings in fields that have received little or 
no plowing (indeed, sometimes directly into stubble or sod), is a promising agricultural technique 
that minimizes soil disturbance and reduces expenditure of fossil fuels. For the relatively few crops 
that can be raised with minimum tillage, it is an admirable practice for making agriculture more 
sustainable and less damaging to the environment. Unfortunately C. sativa requires a well-prepared 
seedbed, and minimum tillage is inappropriate.
Cannabis sativa is rich in bioactive chemicals (of course, this is why marijuana is of interest), 
and decaying plants can produce toxic residues in the soil. Traditional water retting of hemp to

extract the fiber (described in Chapter 7; Figure 16.4) is notorious for polluting waterways, killing 
fish, and producing intolerable odors. Environmental regulations in Western nations prevent such 
obsolete technology, which unfortunately continues to be practiced in Eastern Europe and Asia.
Saving TreeS
Wood fiber (from trees) and synthetic fiber (from petroleum) dominate the fiber market (Chapter 7), 
but ecological and economic concerns about depleting forests and petroleum have increased interest 
in using natural fibers as primary or at least supplemental raw material. In recent decades, the pulp 
and paper industry has been criticized for negatively affecting the environment by deforestation, 
replacing old-growth forests with tree plantations, pollution of air and land (including the produc-
tion of toxic and mutagenic wastes by chlorine bleaching), and high energy use. To an extent, these 
problems have been alleviated by paper recycling, sustainable management of natural and planted 
forests, and adopting less harmful processing technologies. Interestingly, Silva Viera et al. (2010) 
found that for pulp and paper usage, wood (from eucalyptus trees) had less overall negative environ-
mental impacts than hemp (hardly surprising, since trees can grow with virtually no agricultural 
inputs and minimum care). Wood remains the cheapest source of fiber and wood is likely to remain 
dominant, but as discussed in the following, the use of C. sativa as a source of fiber may reduce the 
damage associated with forestry.
The most widespread claim for environmental friendliness of C. sativa is that it has the potential 
to save trees that otherwise would be harvested for production of lumber and pulp. Several factors 
appear to favor increased use of wood substitutes, especially agricultural fibers such as provided by 
hemp (Figure 16.5). Deforestation, particularly the destruction of old growth forests, and the world’s 
decreasing supply of wild timber resources are today major ecological concerns. Agroforestry using 
tree species is one useful response but nevertheless sacrifices wild lands and biodiversity and is 
less preferable than sustainable wildland forestry. The use of agricultural residues (e.g., straw bale 
construction) is an especially environmentally friendly solution to sparing trees, but material limita-
tions restrict use. Nevertheless, agricultural residues often provide a cheap material that otherwise 
might simply be burned, contributing to air pollution. Another chief advantage of several annual

Sustainability
fiber crops over forestry crops is relative productivity, annual fiber crops sometimes producing of 
the order of four times as much material per unit of land. Still another important advantage is the 
precise control over production quantities and schedule that is possible with annual crops. In many 
parts of the world, tree crops are simply not a viable alternative. “Three billion people…live in areas 
where wood is cut faster than it grows or where fuelwood is extremely scarce” (World Commission 
on Environment and Development 1987). “Since mid-century, lumber use has tripled, paper use 
has increased six-fold, and firewood use has soared as Third World populations have multiplied” 
(Brown et al. 1998). Insofar as hemp reduces the need to harvest trees for building materials or 
other products, its use as a wood substitute tends to contribute to preserving forests. Hemp may also 
enhance forestry management by responding to short-term fiber demand while trees need to grow 
for many years to reach their ideal maturation. In areas depleted of natural stands of wood, annual 
crops such as Cannabis can be efficient sources of agricultural fibers to replace forestry products 
and therefore preserve trees (Montford and Small 1999a,b; Small 2012). In developing countries 
where fuelwood is becoming increasingly scarce and food security is a concern, the introduction of 
a dual-purpose crop such as hemp to meet food, shelter, and fuel needs may contribute significantly 
to preserving biodiversity.
BIOREMEDIATION
Some crops are notable for their tolerance of and ability to absorb substantial amounts of heavy 
 metals and so serve for “phytoremediation.” Preliminary work in Germany (noted in Karus and 
Leson 1994) suggested that hemp could be grown on soils contaminated with heavy metals, while 
the fiber remained virtually free of the metals, but as noted in the following, there is now consider-
able evidence that C. sativa can absorb heavy metals and thereby decontaminate soil and water. 
Baraniecki and Mankowski (1995) observed that hemp can reduce the soil content of copper, zinc, 
and cadmium; Loeser et al. (2002) recorded accumulation of zinc, cadmium, and nickel; Piotrowska-
Cyplik and Czarnecki (2003) observed accumulation of zinc, copper, and nickel; and Angelova et al. 
(2004) noted the same for lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium. Koznlowski et al. (1995) observed that 
hemp grew very well on copper-contaminated soil in Poland (although seeds absorbed high levels of 
copper). Baraniecki (1997) found similar results. Mölleken et al. (1997) studied effects of high con-
centration of salts of copper, chromium, and zinc on hemp and demonstrated that some hemp culti-
vars have potential application for growth in contaminated soils. Shi and Cai (2009) recorded hemp 
absorbing substantial cadmium. Pejic et al. (2009) found that waste hemp fiber could be employed to 
remove lead, cadmium, and zinc ions from contaminated water. Petrová et al. (2012) demonstrated 
that chelating agents could be used to improve extraction of metals by hemp. Mihoc et al. (2012) 
found that hempseed seems susceptible to excessive accumulation of metals. Accordingly, it would 
seem unwise to grow hemp as an oilseed on contaminated soils. However, polluted habitats might 
be suitable for a fiber or biomass crop. In fact, Eerens (2003) found that hemp could be grown

economically for fiber in an effluent disposal site. However, Linger et al. (2002) warned that edible 
and clothing uses of hemp grown on heavy metal contaminated soil are inadvisable. Nevertheless, 
for many nonedible applications, particularly construction materials, products made with hemp 
that has accumulated heavy metals are probably safe. Campbell et al. (2002) found that hemp was 
useful for treating soil contaminated with two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chrysene and 
benzo(a)pyrene. The possibility of using hemp for bioremediation deserves additional study (Griga 
and Bjelková 2013).
Wildlife SupporT
Cannabis sativa is plagued by bird predation, which takes a heavy toll on seed production. The seeds 
are well known to provide extremely nutritious food for both wild birds (see Chapter 8 for examples 
of wild bird species on wild hemp) and domestic fowl. Hunters and birdwatchers who discover wild 
patches of Cannabis often keep this information secret, knowing that the area will be a magnet for 
birds in the fall when seed maturation occurs. Upland game birds in the Midwest of the United States 
have been observed to utilize wild hemp as cover for nesting and foraging (Vance 1971).
Increasingly in North America, plants of various species are being employed to revegetate and 
maintain landscapes, especially to provide habitat and food for wildlife, most notably for wild birds. 
The seeds of C. sativa are nutritious and extremely attractive to birds, and were it not for its repu-
tation, wild hemp could be planted for the benefit of wildlife. Cannabis sativa has not yet been 
seriously considered for this purpose. However, the species is not an aggressive weed and certainly 
has great potential for being used as a wildlife plant. Of course, such usage is forbidden in North 
America, current policies requiring the eradication of wild hemp wherever encountered.
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS
Today, there is a search for novel materials that address societal concerns and regulations regarding 
the environmental costs associated with products. A “green image” has economic value, and con-
versely, a negative environmental reputation is a liability (of course, it is often difficult to determine 
which information presented in advertising is factual and which is merely promotional). As stated 
by Fletcher et al. (1995), industrial hemp has a large devotional following because of its green image 
and its products seem to be almost self-promoting. Market segmentation for ethically produced 
goods and growing support for biodegradable and natural products have led to a wide range of new 
industrial hemp products being developed.
Hemp vS. CoTTon
In the last several decades, synthetic fibers (particularly polyester) have come to dominate the tex-
tile fiber market (as illustrated in Figure 7.1). Synthetic fibers are largely made from petroleum 
and so contribute to the depletion of fossil energy resources. Accordingly, many environmentally 
conscious consumers favor textiles made from natural fibers. The natural fiber market is dominated 
by cotton, considered by many to be the bête noire of all environmentally damaging crops because 
of its huge consumption of pesticides, fertilizers, and water (Soth et al. 1999; Small 2013b; Figure 
16.6). In the European Union (EU), where legislation has strongly favored both natural fibers and 
sustainable crops, hemp has been significantly subsidized. Another consideration is the “locavore” 
ideal of producing crops close to home. By this credo, hemp is preferable in temperate regions to the 
use of tropical and semitropical fibers like cotton, which need to be imported. It must be conceded, 
however, that synthetic fibers and cotton are dominant because of cost and quality considerations, 
and despite its environmental and ethical advantages, hemp is unlikely to develop more than a niche 
fabric market.

Sustainability
reCyClabiliTy
As noted in the following, in contrast to many products manufactured from traditional plastics 
and metal, hemp biocomposites can be much more recyclable. Plastics made with hemp fiber 
(described in Chapter 7) are one of the products touted as having great potential to increase sustain-
ability while reducing environmental damages. Singha et al. (2011) summed up the advantages of 
fiber-hemp-based composites as follows: “Sustainability, ‘cradle to grave’ design, industrial ecol-
ogy, eco-efficiency, and biocompatibility are the guiding principles of development of new genera-
tions of materials. Lignocellulosic reinforced composites are the materials of the new paradigm. 
The use of biodegradable and environment friendly plant-based fibers in the composites reduces 
waste disposal problems, environment pollution, and ecological concerns. Light weight, decreased 
wearing of machines, low abrasiveness, as well as an absence of health hazards during processing, 
application, and upon disposal are added advantages of these composites. Also these fibers can be 
incinerated, are CO2 neutral (when they are burned), and because of their hollow and cellular struc-
ture, perform well as acoustical and thermal insulators.”
Carbon SequeSTering
The ecology of carbon cycling is of great concern today because combustion and other activi-
ties contribute to carbon-based greenhouse gases and climate change. The ecological value of 
FIGURE 16.6 Former floor of the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan, central Asia, showing abandoned ships in a toxi-
cally polluted wasteland, caused by draining rivers feeding the sea in order to irrigate cotton and overusing 
pesticides and fertilizers. The Aral Sea was once the world’s fourth largest inland body of water but is in a 
desert area and exists only because it is fed by rivers. This is one of the world’s most tragic examples of the 
destructive effects of unsustainable agricultural practices and one of the greatest environmental catastrophes 
ever recorded. Photo taken in 2011 by S. Kluger (CC BY 3.0).

manufactured products is determined in part by the extent to which they sequester carbon (i.e., 
capture and store carbon compounds, thereby preventing release of carbon-based greenhouse gases 
to the atmosphere). Since plastics have long life cycles, bioplastics sequester carbon for long periods, 
which is environmentally beneficial. “Cradle-to-grave” analyses of energy expenditure and carbon 
sequestration suggest that hemp (indeed many natural fibers) is valuable in these respects (Haufe 
and Carus 2011a,b; Piotrowski and Carus 2011; Ip and Miller 2012). However, as noted later, the 
indoor production of marijuana is associated with astronomical production of carbon dioxide that 
contributes to atmospheric pollution.
THermal inSulaTion produCTS
Insulation to regulate temperature is an extremely important way of reducing energy consump-
tion and thereby limit damage to the terrestrial and atmospheric environments and biodiversity. 
As noted in Chapter 7, hemp-straw-reinforced materials have excellent insulating properties and 
can replace conventional brick, cement and wood, vapor barriers, insulation, and plaster board 
in buildings. Hemp is also useful for producing insulation (e.g., Figure 16.7). Thermal insulation 
products are the second most important sector of the hemp industry of the EU (Carus et al. 2013). 
These are in demand because of the alarmingly high costs of heating fuels, ecological concerns 
about conservation of nonrenewable resources, and political-strategic priorities about the depen-
dence on current sources of oil. Thermal insulation is a market segment that is growing, and hemp 
insulation products are increasing in popularity. Although hemp fiber is suitable for insulation 
(Kymäläinen and Sjöberg 2005), in the EU, glass and mineral wool (rock wool) insulation cost 
one-quarter to one-half as much as hemp insulation. The attraction of hemp insulation products 
is that they are nonirritating to installers, have notable moisture flow and heat-retaining char-
acteristics, and are appealing to customers who view hemp as an ecologically superior choice, 
regardless of cost.

Sometimes referred to as “environmental blankets,” these ground-covering, biodegradable mats 
are designed to prevent soil erosion along steep highway banks and prevent soil slippage. They 
stabilize new plantings and natural vegetation, which grow through the mats, developing root 
systems that retain the soil. Hemp erosion control mats have been manufactured in Europe and 
Canada.

STATE SUBSIDIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP—GOOD OR BAD?
The major crops of most rich countries are usually subsidized by direct grants or indirectly through 
supports for research, needed materials, or transportation. Additional support is often available in 
the form of protectionist policies. While such state sponsorship protects domestic producers against 
international competition and encourages local business and employment, it promotes inefficiency. 
By its nature, agriculture is the world’s leading source of environmental damage, and therefore, 
agricultural subsidies can be especially environmentally damaging. Especially galling is subsidiza-
tion of corn (maize) ethanol production in the name of environmental sustainability, despite doing 
more harm than good (see, for example, Conca 2014). (Cannabis has limited prospects for use as an 
ethanol source; Barta et al. 2010.)
As a comparatively minor crop, C. sativa has not received a great amount of subsidization, and 
indeed, expensive security requirements have put it at an economic disadvantage. Nevertheless, the 
EU has been a leading promoter of agricultural subsidies for crops that are thought to benefit the 
environment, particularly those that can produce biofuel and bio-energy, and for decades, C. sativa 
has been a major beneficiary of this policy. Without substantial subsidization in Europe, the start-up 
capital that was necessary to establish the hemp industry in the 1990s would not have been avail-
able. In recent years, however, subsidization has decreased substantially, particularly because the 
European industrial hemp industry has been based mostly on fiber, which has not proven to have 
notable growth potential and is significantly limited competitively without financial support. As of 
2012, the EU eliminated most of the subsidies for hemp.
In Canada, limited subsidies (both national and provincial) have been provided to the industrial 
hemp industry (legalized in 1998) to encourage the development of novel hemp enterprises, improve 
processing technologies, and develop new hemp cultivars for the Canadian environments (Salentijn 
et al. 2015). In contrast to Europe, the Canadian hemp industry has been mostly centered on oilseed, 
a natural “fit” since Canadian agriculture is based on cereals and oilseeds (i.e., “grains”), and no 
crop (including hemp) is grown significantly for fiber. Indeed, as made clear in several chapters of 
this book, the future of industrial hemp lies much more in oilseed usage rather than in fiber applica-
tions. Nevertheless, the Canadian government subsidized the establishment of a large decortication 
plant (Parkland Industrial Hemp Processing) for hemp stems, which was established in Gilbert 
Plains, Manitoba, in 2013.
As reviewed in this chapter, industrial hemp has many genuinely admirable features contributing 
to sustainability, as well as a few attributes that are somewhat troubling. Compared to most crops 
currently being subsidized, C. sativa is relatively deserving of support.
ENVIRONMENTAL COST OF INDOOR PRODUCTION OF MARIJUANA
Because of security concerns, marijuana is often grown indoors. There are a few environmental 
advantages of growing crops indoors. Such cultivation is invariably extremely efficient, with a much 
higher yield per unit area occupied compared to field crops, so this reduces pressure to find agri-
cultural lands in a world that has almost run out of unused arable land. As with all crop cultivation, 
water (which is scarce) and fertilizers (which tend to pollute) are consumed, and waste materials are 
generated, but these are relatively easy to control in the confined space of a greenhouse. Pests and 
diseases always accompany crops, but at least in a greenhouse, they are easy to locate and control, 
especially using nonchemical techniques.
Indoor cultivation does have several significant environmental costs. Wearing a T-shirt embla-
zoned with a slogan like “Save the world: smoke dope” ignores the reality that marijuana is not 
entirely benign to the planet. Glass houses or at least transparent roofs take advantage of natural 
sunlight, but frequently, marijuana “grow rooms” are completely artificially illuminated. Extremely 
high energy expenditure is required to produce marijuana indoors, primarily because of the need for 
lighting, but also to provide ventilation (to assist temperature control for living plants and for drying 
 

416

harvested marijuana), heating/cooling for climate control, and cool storage (to prevent deterioration 
of the product). Mills (2012) reported that 1% of the entire energy consumption of the United States is 
dedicated to the production of indoor marijuana, equivalent to $6 billion annually. Building materials 
to house marijuana production facilities are expensive to purchase but are also costly in that energy 
was required for their construction. All factors considered, a very large expenditure of energy and 
consequent “environmental imprint” is associated with the indoor cultivation of marijuana.
Indoor production of marijuana is also associated with the production of carbon dioxide, which 
acts as a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. Much of the electrical energy utilized 
results in CO2 production, and often, fuels are burned directly in support of greenhouse operations, 
releasing CO2. Mills (2012) calculated that 1 kg of marijuana produced indoors is associated with 
the release of 4600 kg of CO2 emission to the atmosphere, equivalent to operating 3 million cars for 
a year. Occasionally, CO2 is injected into grow rooms to increase photosynthesis and yields, and this 
also contributes to atmospheric pollution. However, since productivity is increased, the overall car-
bon footprint of introducing CO2 may actually decrease negative environmental impacts (BOTEC 
Analysis Corporation 2013).
BOTEC Analysis Corporation (2013) is a report of the environmental costs of producing mari-
juana for a legal market in Washington State. Several observations in the report are worth noting. 
It was pointed out that indoor lighting carried out during the night period is relatively efficient 
and would have a smaller deleterious effect on climate than lighting during daylight hours, when 
there is high demand for electricity. It was noted that although the environmental costs of cannabis 
production are substantial, they are significantly less than associated with other activities such as 
large-scale agriculture, mining, metallurgy, and other industries. As in all indoor plant production 
requiring lighting with high-intensity discharge bulbs, there is an environmental cost associated 
with the nonrecyclable bulbs containing mercury and other toxins.
ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE 
ILLEGAL CULTIVATION OF MARIJUANA
“Grow-ops” (grow operations, known as “cannabis factories” in the United Kingdom) are often 
located in suburban houses modified with stolen electricity to power lighting, ventilation, and irri-
gation systems (note Figure 16.8). Irresponsible and incompetent installations have resulted in heat,

Sustainability
moisture, and electrical shorts ruining or burning down houses. Preparation of hashish by butane 
extraction has produced explosions and fires.
Illicit outdoor operations are frequently carried out in plots hidden in forested areas (Figures 16.9 
and 16.10). Using public lands is motivated in part by the threat of forfeiting assets that are present when 
using personal residences for production. Those who establish plots and visit them only to maintain and 
harvest the plants have been called “guerrilla growers.” The illegal cultivation of cannabis in preserved 
wildlands is extremely deleterious to biodiversity and its supporting habitats (U.S. Senate Committee 
on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry 1988; Montford and Small 1999a, 1999b; Mallery 2011). 
Regrettably, illicit marijuana producers usually have little respect for delicate ecosystems. Garbage 
is dumped in national parks (Figure 16.11), and groundwater and creeks are contaminated with pes-
ticides, herbicides, and spilled fuel carried to the sites to run diesel generators. Diesel production of 
electricity produces considerably more greenhouse gases than the relatively low-carbon electricity used 
FIGURE 16.9 Illegal marijuana grow site in the White River National Forest near Redstone, Colorado 
(plants being removed for destruction in the top photo). Discovered in 2013, the plantation contained 3375 
plants, with an estimated value of $8.4 million (based on a value of $5500 per kilogram and an estimated yield 
of 0.45 kg of processed material per plant). Photos (public domain) by the U.S. Forest Service.

conventionally (“diesel dope” is a pejorative phrase descriptive of marijuana produced using diesel 
energy). In California, rodenticides are often used to prevent small mammals from destroying illegal 
marijuana plants. Rats consume the poison, and then northern spotted owls, fishers, foxes, and bobcats 
eat the rats and become sick. Thompson et al. (2014) documented the considerable deleterious effects of 
rodenticides on fishers in California as a result of illicit marijuana plantations.
An additional negative result of the widespread clandestine cultivation of marijuana is that it stimu-
lates law enforcement personnel to use chemical eradication at extremely toxic levels so as to ensure that 
there are no surviving plants (although herbicides are often of limited effectiveness for plants taller than 
about 60 cm). Paraquat has been widely applied to illicit Cannabis plantations in Mexico (Figure 12.13b).
A recent study of illicit marijuana cultivation in California (Bauer et al. 2015) observed that 
outdoor plants at a density of about one per square meter were consuming 22.7 L of water per plant 
per day. So extensive was water withdrawal from rivers in northern California that marijuana culti-
vation was using up 50% more water than all residents combined in San Francisco. This threatened 
fish and other aquatic species, particularly federally listed salmon and steelhead trout, as well as 
sensitive amphibian species, in the drought-prone state.
Because of constant searching for illicit plantings of marijuana, plantations tend to be small, 
growers often establishing several gardens in separate areas. Large monocultures of agricultural 
crops as grown in most of the temperate world are very productive but are environmentally harm-
ful because they exclude almost all plants and animals from a region. Small “cottage gardens,” as 
widely grown in tropical areas, are much friendlier to the environment because they permit survival 
in the natural areas between the crops. Curiously, the small, well-separated marijuana gardens that 
are frequent in some locations are not entirely without redeeming value, because they avoid the 
negative effects of large monocultures.
THE DANGEROUS CONCEPT OF EMPLOYING BIOWEAPONS 
TO ELIMINATE MARIJUANA PLANTS
In the last several decades, the idea of using natural pests, parasites, and diseases to eliminate ille-
gally cultivated plants has surfaced. Biocontrol agents for destroying or controlling a given plant 
FIGURE 16.11 Garbage and debris left at a marijuana grow site in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in 
California. Photo (public domain) by U.S. Forest Service.
 

420
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
species can be identified by systematically searching for the natural parasites of the species as 
well as its closest relatives (McPartland and Nicholson 2003). The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(2004) conducted unsuccessful studies from 1999 to 2004 to find insects that could be employed to 
destroy marijuana. The use of fungi as “mycoherbicides” to control marijuana plants has also been 
proposed (Hildebrand and McCain 1978; McCain and Noviello 1985; Tiourebaev et al. 2001). In 
fact, there have been attempts to genetically engineer fungi to destroy drug plants, including mari-
juana, as well as ruderal hemp (Baloch et al. 1974; McCain and Noviello 1985; McPartland 1997a; 
Committee on Mycoherbicides for Eradicating Illicit Drug Crops 2011). Fusarium oxysporum is a 
fungal pathogen that produces fusarium wilt disease in over a hundred plant species. It includes sev-
eral physiological forms known as formae speciales (singular: forma specialis, abbreviated f. sp.), 
one of which is a specialist on Cannabis: F. oxysporum f. sp. cannabis. When employed to kill 
weeds, it is sometimes called “Agent Green.” McPartland and West (1999) reviewed problems asso-
ciated with use of this, noting that such new pathogens would inevitably endanger hemp cultivation, 
to say nothing of wild hemp, which constitutes a reservoir of genes for the improvement of hemp. 
These authors also raised the prospect that once pathogens are released into the environment, muta-
tion and recombination with native fungi could produce new strains of virulent transgenic patho-
gens that could endanger crop plants. The possibility of employing microorganisms as weapons is 
particularly controversial. Natural pests have sometimes proven to be useful biocontrol agents for 
various pest organisms, and with appropriate research prior to release, the risk of unforeseen con-
sequences can be minimized. Unfortunately, microbes, including fungi, are exceptionally difficult 
to control. They can evolve much faster than higher organisms like insects (which are the main 
biocontrol agents), and once released, they cannot be recaptured. Eliminating an entire species (and 
perhaps its relatives) from a region can require very widespread distribution of the control agent and 
represents an experiment with natural ecosystems that is dangerous.
SUSTAINABILITY DEPENDS ON USING SUSTAINABLE METHODS
In conclusion, it should be stressed that irrespective of the inherent advantages and disadvantages 
of C. sativa from the perspectives of sustainability and environmental friendliness, the impacts 
of cultivation of Cannabis depend on the agricultural, processing, and manufacturing practices 
employed. While it is possible to produce and process plants employing sustainable practices, not 
all growers do so. Processing and manufacturing of both industrial hemp and marijuana also have 
environmental costs, which can be controlled to at least some extent. So while C. sativa can be 
employed to reduce environmental damage, this can only be achieved by conscientious human 
effort.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• The energy needed to produce indoor marijuana for a single joint could power a 100-W 
light bulb for 25 hours and would generate 1.5 kg of polluting CO2 emissions (Mills 2012).
• The energy required to produce one marijuana joint is about equal to the requirement to 
manufacture 18 pints of beer (Mills 2012).
• Hawken (2007) noted “…we cannot save our planet unless human kind undergoes a wide-
spread spiritual and religious awakening.” Fortunately, religions are playing roles in advo-
cating for ecological sustainability. Polytheistic and naturalistic spiritual traditions have 
long exhibited profound respect for nature and are natural supporters of environmental-
ism. Buddhism’s tenets of reincarnation and karma require respect for plants, animals, 
and their habitats. Hinduism too has profound respect for life and the need to cherish the 
earth. Indigenous people everywhere are deeply tied to the welfare of their native lands. 
By contrast, monotheistic religions have been less obvious supporters of issues concerned 
with ecological conservation of land and living things, but in recent times, this is changing. 
 

421
Sustainability
The Vatican has recently set an excellent example, installing solar panels on its 10,000-seat 
main auditorium building, arranging to reforest land in Hungary to offset Vatican City’s 
carbon emissions and urging protection of the environment in a number of major addresses 
by Pope Benedict.
• As pointed out in Chapter 7, hemp fiber has been employed to produce strong, lightweight 
plastic used in car bodies, contributing to sustainability by virtue of reducing the use of 
fossil fuels that contribute to atmospheric pollution. In addition to hemp, fiber from other 
crops is being investigated as a possible component of plastic car bodies. One of the most 
interesting projects is being conducted by ketchup maker H.J. Heinz in conjunction with 
the Ford motor company, other manufacturers, and the World Wildlife Fund—members 
of the Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance, whose goal is to use waste agricultural materials to 
produce useful plant products. Heinz harvests over two million tons of tomatoes annually, 
and while some of the residue is fed to livestock, most of the refuse is wasted. To date, 
the use of tomato waste, left after the pulp has been extracted to produce ketchup, hasn’t 
resulted in a plastic strong enough for car bodies.

17 Germplasm Resources
DEFINITION OF GERMPLASM
“Germplasm” is material that can be used to reproduce or propagate organisms of any kind. This 
can include living creatures, their reproductive sex cells, or nonsexual (“somatic”) parts or struc-
tures that can be employed to reconstitute the original organisms. Germplasm of economically 
significant plants mostly includes either or both of (1) living plants in nature or in special cultivated 
collections and (2) viable seeds preserved in climate-controlled conditions. Infrequently (because 
it is expensive and technologically difficult), viable plant material of special significance is main-
tained as living or frozen tissue or cell cultures.
IN SITU VS. EX SITU CONSERVATION OF WILD GERMPLASM
The diversity of wild plants is ideally preserved by allowing them to grow in their natural undis-
turbed habitats (Figure 17.1), where the often considerable range of genic variation can continue to 
exist. Unfortunately, human domination of the planet is degrading or exterminating habitats that 
support wild species. In some cases, wild areas are reserved to allow the organisms to continue to 
survive. Alternatively, selected individuals of species that are highly threatened with extinction are 
sometimes cared for by people in nonnatural circumstances (parks, arboreta, institutional gardens, 
zoos, and the like). Preservation in natural habitats has come to be categorized as in situ conserva-
tion, preservation outside of such habitats as ex situ conservation. In situ conservation is usually far 
less costly and is capable of maintaining much more genic diversity than is possible with ex situ 
conservation, which necessarily is based only on selected samples. The normally small samples of 
material kept in collections are subject to mutations and accidental hybridization during periodic 
replication and loss of alleles of genes that occurs naturally when reproduction occurs in small 
populations, so over time ex situ collections tend to become less representative of the original wild 
population. For flowering plants such as Cannabis sativa, both in situ and ex situ conservations are 
important, as discussed further in this chapter.
PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF GERMPLASM VS. LONG-TERM 
CONSERVATION IN PUBLIC COLLECTIONS
Domesticated crops (land races or cultivars) have a kind of “natural” existence in agro-ecosystems, 
mostly in cultivated fields and in the hands of farmers and the agricultural industry, and a kind of 
“unnatural” existence in special long-term biorepositories such as gene banks and botanical gardens. 
However, distinctive crop variants usually have a much shorter life expectancy than distinctive wild 
plant variants. Because new cultivars regularly replace old cultivars and land races, the only way to 
maintain the range of germplasm in land races and old cultivars, over the long-term, is to conserve 
them in special ex situ collections. Experience has shown that governmental and nonprofit institu-
tions are far more likely to conserve germplasm over many years, by comparison with the private 
sector. Most collections maintained by governments will not be used for many years. The point of 
preserving them is to allow research to explore their usefulness over decades, indeed over centuries. 
By contrast, in business, the “shelf life” of materials that have lost their current utility is necessarily 
limited. The ethical way for the private sector to rid itself of germplasm that is not of further finan-
cial interest is to deposit it in long-term public germplasm banks (gene banks). Unfortunately, the 
private sector is motivated primarily by the profit potential of its property and accordingly wishes 

424
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
to keep some seed stocks out of the hands of competitors, so without regulations requiring contribu-
tions to public repositories, considerable germplasm is destined for extinction. Just as patents and 
other forms of intellectual property are time-limited (Chapter 15), it should be possible for govern-
ments to insist that valuable germplasm in the hands of the private sector should be made available 
to society after a reasonable period of exclusive ownership. As noted in this chapter, there is a great 
need for germplasm of C. sativa to be preserved, and it would be tragic if the large collections held 
by business interests were not maintained for the long-term welfare of everyone.
WORLD GENE BANK SITUATION
At present, there are approximately 1750 plant gene banks in over 100 countries, storing more than 
7.4 million germplasm accessions (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2010). Major gene 
banks include those in Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States. Although all of the world’s plant species, especially those that 
are rare or endangered, are eligible for deposit in gene banks, in practice, most gene banks are 
dedicated to crop germplasm. Modern gene banks conduct several key activities: they ensure that 
acquired material is authoritatively identified and record collection data; they examine seeds for 
purity and viability; and they preserve material under appropriate conditions, regenerating seeds 
every few years to ensure continuing viability. Frequently, there are associated research programs, 
often involving characterization of the accessions. Normally, gene banks distribute material to each 
other and to researchers.
England’s Millennium Seed Bank (Figure 17.2), appropriately labeled a “seed bank” rather than 
a “gene bank,” is dedicated to collecting all plant species, and in this respect is unlike most long-
term seed collections, which are usually dedicated to crops and their wild relatives. In 2008, one 
accession of C. sativa was listed (FAO 2016; Table 17.1).
Plant breeders and researchers employ the accessions in gene banks as raw material for plant 
breeding and for basic biological research, and naturally, the importance of a particular crop deter-
mines how many accessions are deposited. The most important crops, especially the cereals, have 
the largest numbers of accessions. Seed collections of the major crops are often duplicated in dif-
ferent gene banks as a security precaution against the destruction of a particular gene bank.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault (Figure 17.3) is particularly concerned with crops and their wild 
relatives but is a backup facility for other institutions. In 2009, it contained three accessions of 
C. sativa (FAO 2016; Table 17.1).
SEED STORAGE IN GENE BANKS
Ninety percent of material stored in plant germplasm banks is in the form of seeds (Pritchard and 
Nadarajan 2008). However, some tropical species with so-called “recalcitrant” seeds, which do not 
tolerate freezing and/or drying, require more complicated methods for conservation. The seeds of 
some species can remain viable under ambient conditions for decades, rarely for centuries, but those 
of most plants will not germinate after a few years, unless preserved under conditions of low tem-
perature and/or humidity. Under cold storage, the otherwise short-lived seeds of some species will 
last decades, others for hundreds of years, lower temperatures tending to prolong viability. Many 
seeds can be maintained in liquid nitrogen at its boiling point of −196°C (as in Figure 17.4).
CLONAL STORAGE IN GENE BANKS
Some very valuable root or tuber crops (e.g., cassava, potato, sweet potato, taro, and yam), fruit 
crops (e.g., apple, banana, cranberry, date, hop, orange, pear, and strawberry), nut crops (e.g., hazel-
nut, hickory nut, macadamia, and walnut), and indeed many others are mostly propagated vegeta-
tively, and living clones are maintained in special gardens. All of the preceding species mentioned 
are perennials (although yams are grown as annuals), and long-lived plants are naturally adapted 
to vegetative reproduction, hence to being propagated as clones. Cannabis sativa is an annual, 
FIGURE 17.3 The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a secure seed collection in an abandoned coal mine on the 
Norwegian island of Spitsbergen in the remote Arctic, providing a continuously frozen environment. Seeds 
of crops are stored at −18°C, and if the electrical supply fails, the permafrost keeps temperatures at no higher 
than −3.5°C. Almost 900,000 seed samples of more than 5000 different species have been deposited. The 
facility is expected to grow to become the world’s largest collection of seeds of crops, with a capacity to store 
about five million samples. Known as “the doomsday vault,” the purpose is to back up important crop germ-
plasm in other seedbanks that could be destroyed by disaster. Unlike conventional seed banks that exchange 
seeds with numerous individuals and other institutions, only the depositor seed banks have access to their 
materials. Left: Containers of seeds stored on shelves. Public domain photo by NordGen/Dag Terje Filip

normally reproduced by seed, but many annuals can easily be maintained as clones by the use of 
hormones that stimulate cuttings of the plant to root (in a sense, cloning an annual plant turns it into 
a perennial). Plants that humans have judged merit propagation as clones are generally outstanding 
in some desired respects and indeed are often hybrids exhibiting heterosis (hybrid vigor). Since all 
plants established from a clone share the same genetic makeup, they are extremely uniform in per-
formance. The main disadvantage is that genetic uniformity makes clones very susceptible to the 
possibility that a mutant disease can become disastrously effective. While the agricultural depart-
ments of many nations maintain numerous clonal cultivars, clones of drug strains of Cannabis are 
being maintained almost exclusively by the private sector and by research institutions. Cannabis 
clones are rarely provided in commerce or shared in research circles in the same way as propagating 
material of potatoes, apples, and many other crops.
CELL AND TISSUE STORAGE IN GENE BANKS
Living materials are sometimes preserved as continuously propagated cell cultures (i.e., they are 
maintained as single cells or proliferating cells not organized into tissues) or as tissue cultures, 
which can be employed to grow innumerable identical plantlets (Figure 17.5). Animal tissues 
(principally semen, ova [unfertilized eggs], and embryos) of very valuable livestock are now often 
stored cryogenically in liquid nitrogen, and some gene banks today similarly conserve apical 
meristems (growing points or “buds”) of some species. Pollen grains also can be maintained

are stored long-term in “cryovats” of liquid nitrogen. (Public domain photo.)

long-term under cold storage. These advanced biotechnological methods are in use for C. sativa 
by some private firms assembling genetic collections, and usually, the information is guarded as 
intellectual property. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has supported research into 
the conservation of marijuana clones as shoot cultures and “synthetic seeds” (Lata et al. 2012; 
see Chapter 4).
CORE COLLECTIONS
Long-term storage of seeds (for decades or more) is expensive because it requires stringent control 
of temperature and, often, humidity. Seeds lose viability over time even under controlled storage, 
and periodic regeneration (typically once every one to three decades) to grow a new batch of seeds 
is also expensive. “Genetic erosion” is the loss of alleles (variations of genes) or of allele combina-
tions, and this commonly occurs because some new cultivars become so popular that old cultivars 
(along with their unique genes) are lost. To combat this loss of potentially useful breeding material, 
gene bank managers have tried to maintain many different and large samples of the varieties and 
landraces of a crop. However, this is costly. In recent years, attempts have been made to identify 
“core collections”—made up of selected key accessions that represent the bulk of the genetic variation 
of a species present in a germplasm collection—so that demands by researchers for seeds will be 
more limited, reducing the need to generate seeds of many of the accessions. Core collections have 
not been prepared to date for C. sativa.
THE IMPORTANCE OF N.I. VAVILOV
More than any other individual, the Russian geneticist and agronomist Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov 
(1887–1943; Figure 17.6) was responsible for persuading the world about the importance of col-
lecting and preserving germplasm that can be used by breeders to create new crops and improve 
old crops. He is widely considered to have been the foremost plant geographer. He pioneered theo-
ries concerning centers of origin of cultivated plants and developed concepts regarding the origin 
of crops (Vavilov 1926a, 1992) that are still widely respected. In the 1930s, the bureaucrat T.D. 
Lysenko (1898–1976), a pseudo-scientist whose ideology suited the totalitarian, communist Soviet 
Union and its dictator Joseph Stalin (1879–1953), challenged Vavilov’s ideas. At great personal risk 
and demonstrating extraordinary intellectual honesty, Vavilov tried to defend his scientific conclu-
sions, but this resulted in his imprisonment in 1940 (Figure 1.14) and death in 1943. Lysenko’s ideas 
led to the discredit of Soviet genetics, the failure of Soviet agriculture, and in no small way to the 
end of the Soviet Union. Vavilov’s studies considerably clarified the nature of wild Cannabis, and 
it is fitting that the largest and most important germplasm collection of C. sativa now resides in the 
N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry, which commemorates his achievements.

SEED STORAGE CONDITIONS FOR CANNABIS SATIVA
Almost all material of C. sativa conserved long-term is in the form of seeds. The longevity of 
Cannabis seeds is known to decrease fairly rapidly, to about 75% after two years of storage in a 
sheltered but otherwise uncontrolled climate, a level that is generally considered too low for com-
mercial planting. The literature regarding factors influencing seed longevity was reviewed by Small 
and Brookes (2012). Small and Brookes (2012) also experimentally examined the interactions of 
temperature, humidity, and an oxygen-free environment as they affected seed longevity of industrial 
cultivars, drug strains, and ruderal plants. Progressive lowering of the temperature (from 20°C to 
−80°C) increased seed longevity, so did progressive lowering of moisture content (from 11% to 4%). 
A high moisture content (11%) at room temperature was fatal to all of the seeds examined within 18 
months (fungi generally attack the seeds when they are so moist). Either reducing the temperature 
to at least 5°C or reducing the seed moisture content to at least 6% had a huge beneficial effect on 
maintaining seed viability. Additional reduction of temperature, but not additional reduction of 
moisture content, had a small supplementary beneficial effect.
Small and Brookes (2012) found that storage under nitrogen gas (i.e., in an oxygen-free environ-
ment) had no effect on longevity. The seeds of C. sativa are known to be appreciably impermeable 
to air, as evidenced by the observation that the seed oil oxidizes (becomes rancid) with distressing

rapidity once extracted (so preservation in cold, dark conditions is required for commercial pur-
poses). The presence of the antioxidant vitamin E in the seeds also provides protection against the 
deleterious effects of oxygen. These considerations likely explain why exclusion from oxygen did 
not improve seed germination.
Small and Brookes (2012) made the following practical recommendations regarding storage of 
Cannabis seed (for more detailed information, see Chapter 7):
• For long-term germplasm banking of C. sativa seed in a viable state for up to a decade, a 
moisture content of 6% coupled with a storage temperature of −20°C, is sufficient.
• For periods of more than a decade of storage before seed is regenerated, lower moisture 
content and temperature are appropriate.
THE CHALLENGE OF PREVENTING POLLEN CONTAMINATION 
OF CANNABIS SATIVA GERMPLASM
As detailed in Chapter 4, C. sativa pollen is produced in prodigious quantities and is carried by the 
wind for very long distances. In Canada and Europe, an isolation distance of 5 km is required for 
the production of seed that is to be used to produce industrial hemp crops (although Small and Antle 
2003 found that the amount of pollen distributed downwind was about six times the amount distrib-
uted upwind). Ensuring that weedy or clandestine plants are not present for a distance of 5 km is very 
challenging outdoors. Accordingly, renewing seeds of large collections of C. sativa in gene banks, 
outdoors or even in greenhouses not isolated from outdoor pollen, is very difficult. For this reason, 
it is wise to preserve C. sativa seeds in gene banks for very long terms before renewal is required.
In the Gatersleben (Germany) gene bank, one of the world’s finest, a distance of 80 to 100 m 
between different populations has been deemed sufficient for reproducing seed of small plots (100 
plants/accession), provided that no large hemp fields are in proximity, wind direction is favorable, 
and hedges provide some protection (personal communication, Axel Diederichsen).
THE SHAMEFULLY INADEQUATE STATE 
OF GERMPLASM PRESERVATION OF CANNABIS SATIVA
As discussed in the following, germplasm resources for C. sativa are quite unsatisfactory. As 
expressed by Watson and Clarke (1997): “The last 60–70 years have been disastrous for the 
Cannabis gene pool, and many local landraces, the result of hundreds of years of selection for local 
use, have been lost because of Cannabis eradication, neglect on the part of agricultural officials and 
industry, anti-Cannabis propaganda and the general trend (until recently) to reduce industrial hemp 
breeding and research.” At present in North America, there are no conventional public gene banks 
from which one can obtain material for scientific study and technological development or in which 
one can deposit valuable germplasm for potential long-term exploitation. As detailed in the follow-
ing, gene bank resources for C. sativa are largely in a small number of European institutions, and 
they are limited in extent and availability.
THE GERMPLASM IMPORTANCE OF WILD-GROWING CANNABIS SATIVA
All cultivated plants originated from wild plants, and for numerous of these, including most major 
crops, either the wild ancestors or close relatives still exist in nature. As discussed in Chapter 18, 
wild-growing plants of C. sativa are likely mostly or entirely escapes from cultivation that have 
re-evolved adaptations to wild existence. The wild plants represent a natural reservoir of genic 
variation that serves for the improvement of cultivars. Cultivars have always been selected for char-
acteristics desired by people, and this narrows their range of genetic variation and makes them more 
 

431
Germplasm Resources
susceptible to environmental and biotic stresses. Genes from the wild plants can be bred into cul-
tivars to toughen them against stresses, as well as improve agronomic and product characteristics.
Cannabis sativa is of Old World origin and has been present in Eurasia for many thousands 
of years. As noted in Chapter 3 (dealing with the ecology of wild-growing plants), uncultivated 
C. sativa is found growing in a very wide range of habitats in Eurasia. Such plants have evolved 
adaptations to the very different circumstances of these habitats and consequently harbor an enor-
mous range of genic variation. In response to the worldwide condemnation of marijuana in the 
twentieth century, there have been some efforts to eliminate wild-growing plants in certain areas of 
Eurasia, but the attempts have been insignificant. Accordingly, Old World wild plants of C. sativa 
represent an extremely valuable genetic resource.
By contrast with the general tolerance of wild-growing C. sativa in most of Eurasia, there have 
been concerted efforts to eliminate the wild plants of North America. Wild North American hemp 
is derived mostly from escaped European cultivated hemp imported in past centuries. Hemp was 
introduced to North America in Port Royal, Acadia (Nova Scotia), in 1606. It was a popular crop in 
Eastern and Central Canada during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but by the mid-1930s, 
production had ceased, except for a brief revival during World War II. Wild Canadian hemp is 
concentrated along the St. Lawrence and lower Great Lakes (Small 1972b), where considerable cul-
tivation occurred in the 1800s. In the United States, wild hemp is best established in the American 
Midwest and Northeast, where hemp was grown historically in large amounts. Decades of eradica-
tion have exterminated many of the naturalized populations in North America. In the United States, 
wild plants are rather contemptuously called “ditch weed” by law enforcement personnel. However, 
the attempts to destroy the wild populations are short-sighted because they are mostly low in tetra-
hydrocannabinol (THC) and are not employed as a source of marijuana. Mehmedic et al. (2010) 
analyzed 1371 confiscated U.S. samples that they termed “ditch weed” collected from 1993 to 2008, 
and the mean THC concentration was only 0.4%. However, no information was provided that the 
samples actually were ruderal, and they employed the term ditch weed simply to classify low-THC 
collections. Wild North American plants have undergone many generations of natural adaptation 
to local conditions of climate, soil, and pests, and accordingly, it is safe to conclude that they have 
genes that are invaluable for the improvement of hemp cultivars. Nevertheless, present policies in 
North America still require the eradication of wild hemp wherever encountered.
THE GERMPLASM IMPORTANCE OF LANDRACES OF CANNABIS SATIVA
The term landrace (land race) refers to populations of domesticated plants that were selected over 
many generations by farmers in a region. Landraces stand in contrast to cultivars (although occa-
sionally landraces are treated as cultivars). Both landraces and cultivars have some genetic and 
phenotypic (morphological and/or physiological) distinctiveness. Cultivars are usually the product 
of concerted (often consciously directed) selection, in recent times mostly by plant breeders; land-
races are usually the product of relatively unsophisticated (but often remarkably effective) selection 
by farmers. Cultivars usually have a quite narrow genetic base, corresponding with a narrow range 
of variability and a narrow range of adaptation to stresses. Landraces usually have a much wider 
genetic base, corresponding with a broader range of variability and a broader range of adaptation 
to stresses, especially to the local environmental conditions and biotic agents where they were 
selected. Cultivars are currently named according to a formal code of nomenclature (Brickell et al. 
2009), while landraces are often given local names or may simply not have been named. Prior 
to the twentieth century, farmers almost exclusively grew landraces; by the end of the twentieth 
century, advanced (“Westernized”) farming of major crops has become substantially based on the 
use of crop cultivars, most of which are replaced in a decade or two by more advanced cultivars. 
However, third world/developing nations often continue to grow landraces. In many cases, cultivars 
for tropical and subtropical conditions have simply not been bred, and only landraces are available. 
Landraces and cultivars are both important as material from which new cultivars are created, but 
 

432
Cannabis: A Complete Guide
since landraces have a much broader range of genetic variation corresponding with adaptation for 
desirably agronomic characteristics, they are of much greater value in the long run. The loss of a 
cultivar can mean that a decade of effort by a plant breeder has been lost; the loss of a landrace can 
mean that centuries of effort and perhaps irreplaceable genes have been lost. Because agriculture is 
increasingly abandoning landraces (and indeed older cultivars) of most crops, critically important 
germplasm is facing extinction unless preservation efforts are made. As noted in this chapter, con-
servation of industrial hemp landraces is very inadequate.
CHINESE GERMPLASM OF CANNABIS SATIVA
Land races of fiber hemp from China represent the oldest cultivated forms of C. sativa, perhaps trac-
ing back for thousands of years. Genetic studies of these are limited. By contrast, land races from 
Europe are more recent, many probably dating back at least hundreds of years.
Because of the genetic distinctiveness of C. sativa in China and its cultivation there for mil-
lennia, Chinese domesticated variants of the species are of special importance. Wang and Wei 
(2012) surveyed the availability of C. sativa cultivars and land races in China, noting that a general 
decline in growing hemp in recent times was resulting in an alarming reduction in germplasm. 
Most Chinese cultivars are dedicated to fiber production, but some are used for oilseed and others 
are dual purpose. In regard to China, Salentijn et al. (2015) wrote: “Hundreds of hemp landraces 
have been established. Examples are Liuan HuoMa and Liuan HangMa from Anhuiprovince, Laiwu 
DaMa and Laiyang DaMa from Shan Dong province, Gushi KuiMa in Henan province, Wenxian 
DaBaiPi in Hebei province, Liuzhi DaMa in Guizhou province, and DayaoDaMa and Weishan 
DaMa in Yunnan province. Industrial hemp cultivars in China include YunMa 1, YunMa 2, YunMa 
3, YunMa 4, YunMa 5 (all of which are widely cultivated in China) and the less frequently cultivated 
LongDaMa 1, JinMa 1, WangDaMa 1, and WangDaMa 2.” According to Salentijn et al. (2015), 
“Large collections of germplasm resources have been collected and maintained in the Yunnan 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences, which comprise approximately 350 accessions with a good rep-
resentation of fiber/seed hemp groups.”
WORLD GENE BANK COLLECTIONS OF CANNABIS SATIVA
The FAO compiles gene banks holdings. Based on FAO (2016), there were a total of 1530 accessions 
(including duplicates) of seeds of C. sativa, almost all from Europe (Table 17.1).
EUROPEAN “NATIONAL COLLECTIONS” OF CANNABIS SATIVA
While hemp has been cultivated in Asia and South America for centuries, it is basically in Europe 
that germplasm banks have made efforts to preserve hemp seeds for the long-term.
Germplasm collections of C. sativa have been assembled in the principal European nations in 
which industrial hemp was cultivated in the late twentieth or early twenty-first century (Tables 17.1 
and 17.2). These are a mix of public and private collections, and the availability of seeds for use 
by those unaffiliated with the institutions varies, as indicated in Table 17.2. Compared to the very 
extensive preserved collections of most major crops, there are disturbingly few collections of seeds 
of C. sativa (Van Soest et al. 1993).
The VaViloV insTiTuTe ColleCTion
The N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources in St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad), Russia, 
has by far the largest germplasm collection of hemp of any public gene bank, with about 500 collec-
tions, although in the past, it had accumulated 1400 accessions (Grigoryev, undated). Detailed infor-
mation on the majority of hemp accessions of the Vavilov Institute can be found in Anonymous (1975;

also see Table 17.3). Budgetary problems in Russia have endangered the survival of this invaluable 
collection. Maintenance and seed generation issues for the Vavilov hemp germplasm collection are 
discussed in a number of articles in the Journal of the International Hemp Association (e.g., Clarke 
1998b; Lemeshev et al. 1994, 1995; Kutuzova et al. 1996, 1997).
It is particularly disappointing that more than half of the Cannabis accessions of the Vavilov 
Institute develop THC levels that exceed 0.3% (Small and Marcus 2003; Figure 17.7) and that there 
is evidence that the genetic purity of accessions has been compromised by hybridization (Hillig 
2004b). Nevertheless, the value of this collection for future breeding remains outstanding, and every 
effort needs to be made to find new funding to preserve it.
The GaTersleben ColleCTion
The Gatersleben gene bank of Germany, the second largest public gene bank in Europe, has a 
much smaller Cannabis collection compared to the Vavilov collection, with less than 60 acces-
sions. Information on the Gatersleben gene bank is available at http://www.ipk-gatersleben.de/en

NORTH AMERICAN PUBLIC GERMPLASM COLLECTIONS OF CANNABIS SATIVA
The acquisition of germplasm of C. sativa in public institutions of North America has been rig-
orously discouraged to date. My own collections of close to 1000 accessions, prepared for the 
Canadian Department of Agriculture, were necessarily destroyed following completion of the 
studies in which they were employed, and there are no accessions currently maintained for public 
access in Canada as of the writing of this book. The situation in the United States is comparable. 
In 1971, for my cultivation experiments in Ottawa, I received a collection of 57 accessions of 
C. sativa from the USDA (analyses on these are in Table 4 in Small and Beckstead 1973a). These 
had been conserved from a USDA fiber breeding program that was, perhaps surprisingly, still in 
progress in the early 1950s (Feaster 1956a,b). In the late 1990s, requests for seeds resulted in the 
response that no seeds of C. sativa were maintained by USDA, and indeed, all such seeds had to 
be destroyed. Whether low-THC (“hemp”) material still exists in the hands of the USDA is an 
open question. In 1971, I received several high-THC accessions from the U.S. National Institute

GERMPLASM COLLECTIONS AND THE FUTURE OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP
As pointed out in this chapter, there are relatively limited germplasm collections of C. sativa, and 
those pertaining to industrial hemp are mostly in Europe. There are also collections in China, which 
are much less available to other countries. Because industrial hemp is regaining its ancient status 
as an important crop, a number of private germplasm collections have been assembled in recent 
decades for the breeding of low-THC cultivars as commercial ventures (for examples, see De Meijer 
1998; De Meijer and Van Soest 1992; Man’kowska and Grabowska 2009). Commercially produced 
breeding lines are treated as intellectual property, and of course, these are available only on a 
restricted basis, if at all, while cultivars associated with these programs are marketed.
Germplasm resourCes for fiber
Almost all of the publically available germplasm resources for industrial hemp, discussed in this 
chapter, relate to cultivars and land races that have been used entirely or primarily for fiber, and 
these are in European germplasm banks. Unfortunately, European cultivars seem to have a rela-
tively narrow genetic base. According to an analysis by De Meijer (1995a), the four dozen or so 
hemp cultivars of Europe, registered at that time, trace their heritage mostly to just a few local 
landraces. The Italian cultivar Carmagnola, the oldest landrace of Italy, has contributed parentage 
to many European cultivars. Chinese germplasm is not well represented in Europe, and as noted 
previously, interest in fiber hemp in China may be waning.
Germplasm resourCes for oilseed
As discussed in Chapter 8, C. sativa has been grown historically mostly for fiber, with the result 
that there are almost no landraces dedicated to oilseed production available, and only in very 
recent times have cultivars dedicated to oilseed been bred. There may not even be extant land 
races of the kind of hemp oilseed strains that were once grown in Russia. The most pressing need 
of the hempseed industry is for the breeding of more productive oilseed cultivars. Most fiber 
strains (cultivars and land races) have relatively low seed production, and most hemp germplasm 
has certainly not been selected for oilseed characteristics. At present, most available registered 
cultivars are unsuitable for specialized oilseed production. To be competitive with the major oil-
seeds, hemp should produce approximately 2 tonnes/ha; at present, 1 tonne/ha is considered aver-
age to good production. Doubling the productive capacity of a conventional crop would normally 
be considered impossible, but it needs to be understood just how little hemp has been developed 
as an oilseed. There is therefore a desperate need to examine the germplasm of C. sativa in 
order to find genes to improve oilseed hemp. Wild plants of C. sativa have naturally undergone 
selection for high seed productivity and are a particularly important potential source of breeding 
germplasm.
Curiously, marijuana strains have potential for providing genes to breed oilseed cultivars. Drug 
varieties have been selected for very high yield of flowers and accordingly produce very high yield 
of seeds. Drug strains have been observed to produce more than a kilogram of seed per plant, so that 
a target yield of several tonnes per hectare is conceivable (Watson and Clarke 1997). Of course, the 
high THC in drug strains makes these a problematical source of germplasm.

Germplasm Resources
Germplasm resourCes for essenTial oil
As discussed in Chapter 9, essential oil is a very minor economic product of C. sativa, and indeed, 
the essential oil components (terpenes) are available far more cheaply from other crops. Nevertheless, 
biotypes grown for other purposes (fiber, oilseed, or marijuana) sometimes have desirable terpene 
profiles and have occasionally been used for the purpose of harvesting essential oil. It is likely that 
future research will characterize some populations as possessing outstanding essential oil traits 
(indeed, private pharmaceutical firms likely already possess such strains), and hopefully, these will 
be deposited eventually in a public germplasm repository.
GERMPLASM COLLECTIONS AND THE FUTURE 
OF MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA
In the distant past, C. sativa was unregulated, and numerous marijuana landraces were selected. 
Many of these are still being grown in Asia, although law enforcement has reduced cultivation in 
most areas. Some Central Asian marijuana landraces were distributed to Africa, Southeast Asia, 
and the Americas, where local landraces were selected. With the explosion of interest in marijuana 
that began in the 1960s, landraces were employed in Western nations (notably in the Netherlands 
and the United States) by clandestine illicit breeders. During the last several decades, illicit breed-
ers utilized most of the techniques available to scientific breeders and created a wide range of 
strains. Hundreds of named strains are currently distributed in the illicit and medical marijuana 
trades. Thus, an impressive range of germplasm variability exists for marijuana forms of C. sativa, 
albeit mostly in a state of illegality. Not surprisingly, the world’s public gene banks currently do 
not (or at least do not make it public that they) possess marijuana germplasm. Rarely, collections of 
marijuana strains have been made by governmental organizations for research and for law enforce-
ment purposes, most notably by the National Institutes of Health at the University of Mississippi 
(Oxford).
Marijuana germplasm is almost entirely in the possession of the private sector. Over 100 com-
mercial firms, especially in the Netherlands (Figure 17.8), created or assembled collections of 
strains, and these have been marketed internationally (substantially illicitly to date) through the 
Web. A guide to many of these is at http://marijuanaseedbanks.com/ (also see “High-THC Strains” 
in Chapter 11 for a list of books describing strains). Especially in North America, marijuana strains 
are now offered by purveyors of medicinal marijuana, the legality of such transactions differing 
depending on jurisdiction. In Canada and in some U.S. states, numerous strains have been allowed 
to acquire legal status for medicinal purposes. The scientific status of marijuana strains available 
either in the illicit trade or from licensed medicinal sources is very uncertain. (An exception is 
Medisins, a medicinal cultivar registered in 1998.) The extent to which named medicinal strains 
are genuinely different, and just what their differences are, is unclear. Documentation concern-
ing these strains is mostly unreliable and suspect. Sawler et al. (2015) found that strain names 
accompanying materials that they had acquired “often do not reflect a meaningful genetic identity.” 
Literature produced by those in the illicit trade is commonly available but is unreliable on aspects 
dealing with breeding and genetics. Commercial companies involved with medicinal marijuana are 
obviously retaining information for their own commercial motives. Some authorized sellers simply 
provide new names to materials that they have acquired under older names. Companies engage in 
exaggerated claims in order to inflate the value of the material they market, so determination of the 
characteristics of strains is problematical.
Notwithstanding the uncertain scientific status of most marijuana strains, both those in the illicit 
trade and those available legally from authorized sources constitute a vast reservoir of material 
that is potentially useful, either directly for experimental and medicinal applications or for starting 
material for selecting or breeding material suitable for medicinal applications. The principal con-
cern is that there is currently no attempt to collect and preserve germplasm of marijuana forms of

DATABASES
Databases providing information on germplasm holdings in gene banks are critical to locating valu-
able breeding material.
indusTrial hemp
Several of the largest public industrial hemp germplasm collections are associated with basic data-
bases (providing information such as site of origin, collector, year of collection, and whether ruderal 
or a cultivar). Most collections today are backed up by information databases, the private collections

generally restricting access. Bas et al. (2010, based on a 2006 meeting) presented a proposal to pre-
pare a comprehensive database for C. sativa accessions, but subsequently, little had been initiated 
(Pavelek and Lipman 2011, based on a 2010 meeting).

With the proliferation of private firms offering medicinal strains, online information for many 
of these is presented at their websites, although a genuine database does not seem to be avail-
able. Mighell et al. (2013) provide details of the potential usefulness and nature of a strain reg-
istry. “Leafly,” a notable online guide to strains, is at https://www.leafly.com/. Another guide to 
marijuana strains is GM. 2015. A-Z Strain Reviews. Grow Marijuana. http://grow-marijuana.com

GUIDE TO THE MOST COMMONLY GROWN INDUSTRIAL HEMP CULTIVARS
Plant breeders frequently prefer to employ crop cultivars rather than wild plants or even land races 
as starting material because cultivars are already highly refined. This can be short-sighted, as wild 
plants and primitive land races often contain useful genes that have not been preserved in cultivars. 
Nevertheless, currently available industrial hemp cultivars that have been licensed for cultivation in 
the European Union and Canada have all been demonstrated to have limited THC (see Chapter 11), 
and so breeders have little concern that their use in creating new cultivars will produce forms that 
are too high in THC to be grown legally. Table 17.3 provides basic information on most of the 
cultivars recently and currently grown in the Western World. The majority of these are currently 
available and their identification is highly reliable.
There are many additional cultivars or land races (often considered to be cultivars) that are 
grown, depending on whether permitted in given countries. Sometimes, these are known to exceed 
the THC limits that are commonly accepted in the European Union and Canada. However, often, 
particular old cultivars or land races are available only in germplasm collections or from private 
individuals, and the nature and identification of the material are frequently unreliable. I have often 
grown plants from seeds from different sources, identified as the same land race or cultivar, and 
discovered that they have produced quite different plants. Although such material may be mis-
identified and/or hybridized, it can still be valuable as sources of breeding germplasm. The same 
is true for so-called “common seed,” which refers to relatively undefined seeds from a region that 
have been generated in an uncontrolled fashion (with respect to parentage) from local plants (for 
example, “Swissmix,” a dioecious seed stock of Swiss origin grown for fiber). DNA-based genetic 
analysis has the potential of clarifying the identity and history of C. sativa, so the lack of reliable 
characterization should not eliminate given collections from consideration as germplasm sources. 
As noted previously, identification of a core collection is a way of narrowing down large collections 
to a much smaller sample representing the range of genetic variation.
CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
• During the Second World War, the population of the Soviet Union often had to tolerate 
extreme shortages of food. This was particularly true during the Siege of Leningrad (now 
St. Petersburg). Curators of N.I. Vavilov’s seed bank in Leningrad could have pillaged the 
edible seeds in the collection to survive, but some heroically endured starvation rather than 
do so.
• The largest and most important germplasm bank in the world is the U.S. National Plant 
Germplasm System, under the control of the USDA. This has more than 500,000 collec-
tions numbered consecutively starting with P.I.1 (“Plant Introduction 1”), which was cata-
logued in 1898. The collection P.I.1 is a cabbage variety introduced from Russia.

Germplasm Resources
• “Biopiracy” refers to unilaterally adopting for profit, without permission, recognition, 
or compensation, the materials or knowledge of the (usually indigenous) people of a 
region. Historically, germplasm of and traditional knowledge about most crops (including 
Cannabis) have simply been “stolen” and transferred from their areas of origin to much 
richer countries where the plants have been cultivated profitably. The 1993 Convention 
on Biological Diversity provided recommendations intended to benefit financially poor 
regions possessing valuable germplasm and traditional knowledge. Over 90 countries 
are signatories to the anti-biopiracy Nagoya Protocol, a part of the UN Convention on 
Biological Diversity. While noble in intent, identifying and penalizing examples of biopi-
racy have been controversial. Unique biotypes of industrial and medicinal Cannabis, as 
well as clever techniques of cultivation, processing, and product development and usage, 
originate from indigenous people of several poor regions of the world. Should users of can-
nabis be required to provide compensation?

18 Botanical Classification 
and Nomenclatural Issues
Given that Cannabis sativa is the world’s most controversial plant from the perspectives of the law 
and medicine, it should not be surprising that there have also been profound disagreements with 
respect to its taxonomy (scientific classification). This chapter examines C. sativa in the light of the 
criteria that botanists employ to classify plants like it, in which variation deserving to be catego-
rized has been brought into existence by both nature and humans. As has been documented in this 
book, C. sativa occurs widely in nature as free-living populations adapted to local climates, as well 
as domesticated kinds differentially selected for fiber in the stem, a multipurpose oil in the “seeds” 
(achenes), or an intoxicating resin secreted by pin-sized epidermal glands. The variation pattern of 
C. sativa is complex, but the causes of variation are clear and provide guidance for an appropriate 
interpretive classification scheme. The following relatively extensive presentation of classification 
theory and practice is required because, with the exception of how living populations of the human 
species Homo sapiens should be classified (note Figure 18.1) and how extinct relatives in the genus 
Homo should be interpreted (Figure 18.2), no other species has generated so much misunderstand-
ing, argument, and contradictory literature.
THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATION ISSUES
Biological classification (taxonomy or systematics) is based on scientific evaluation of characters 
and genes of organisms, which are employed to assess their similarities or evolutionary relation-
ships, to construct a sort of (usually hierarchical) organization chart that efficiently reflects rela-
tionships, and provides unequivocal names for all of the groups within the system. At least, this is 
the sort of technical definition that one would find in a modern textbook. In fact, people have been 
classifying and naming plants and animals as long as there have been people because it’s impor-
tant (often a matter of life or death) to be able to recognize distinctive creatures, what group they 
belong to (because other members of the group may also have useful or dangerous features), and to 
have unambiguous names (to help identify the organisms and recall information about them). Much 
biological classification is intuitive, and often, a young child can classify some groups as well as a 
modern taxonomist using sophisticated modern tools. However, there are subtleties and complicated 
issues that make some classification issues very difficult. Almost all of the time, the world is content 
to leave such classification problems to the academics, since it doesn’t seem to matter to the daily 
lives of most people. However, the classification of Cannabis is an exception—indeed, the issue has 
been debated more in the public sphere than the classification of any other plant, and understanding 
the conflicting views is important to the welfare of society.
Scientific Classifications Often Differ
Classification of organisms is often controversial because nature presents an extraordinary range 
of variation patterns, so that a “one-size-fits-all” or “cookie-cutter” approach is unwarranted. Also 
contributing to disagreement, there are several dogmatic schools of thought regarding assessment 
procedures and usage of various kinds of genetic information as bases for taxonomic systems. As 
a result, there are often competing classification and naming systems for the same set of living 
creatures. Harlan and de Wet (1971) remarked, “The inconsistencies and lack of agreement among 
taxonomists dealing with the same materials are remarkable, to say the least, and are even more

Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
striking when the treatments of different crops are compared.” The following information is not 
intended to be a complete primer on classification theory but to highlight aspects that have trou-
bled recent attempts to classify Cannabis. Additional considerations are discussed in Small (1979a, 
1979b, 2015a).
Scientific Names Are Often Ambiguous
American literary figure James Whitcomb Riley (1849–1916) famously wrote, “When I see 
a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a 
duck.” However, defining (and consequently recognizing) a duck, or indeed most groups of 
living creatures that seem to merit a unique name, is frequently not as obvious as it seemed to 
Riley. Had Riley been an ornithological specialist on waterfowl, he would have learned that 
the swimming behaviors of birds called ducks differ greatly among species, some ducks do 
not walk like ducks (even if extant ducks do have webbed feet), and most ducks do not quack. 
Among many duck specialists, the inclusiveness of the word “duck” depends on recent evalua-
tions of avian phylogenetic relationships (e.g., Johnson and Sorenson 1999). For example, whis-
tling ducks (tree ducks; subfamily, Dendrocygninae of the duck, goose, and swan family of 
birds, Anatidae) are often considered to belong to tribe Dendrocygnini of the goose subfamily 
Anserinae.
It may seem disturbing that one person’s duck may be another person’s goose or swan (note 
Figure 18.3), but as long as what is meant by the user of a word or phrase is understood, the 
terminology is useful for purposes of communicating information. Conversely, an ambiguous 
word or phrase hinders understanding when it is not clear what meaning is meant. The public 
and, indeed, most scientists have little appreciation of how ambiguous biological “scientific 
names” can be. As discussed in this chapter, names applied to Cannabis have been plagued with 
ambiguity.
FIGURE 18.3  Subtleties of identification, exemplified by Hans Christian Andersen’s The Ugly Duckling. As 
related in the familiar fairy tale, the ugly duckling (the small dark bird at bottom center), in fact a beautiful 
swan, is being persecuted by ducks, among which the egg from which it emerged was accidentally placed. As 
noted in the text, even when the aberrant duckling is identified as a swan, it may still be classified as a “duck.”

Geographical Uncertainties Complicate Interpretation of Groups
All domesticated plants arose ultimately from wild ancestors, which may no longer be extant. Plants 
growing outside of cultivation are commonly said to be “wild,” but (as noted in Chapter 3) the 
term is ambiguous. Basically, a species is “indigenous” (or “native”) to a given geographical area 
if it reproduces there and is present in that location as the result of natural processes, without the 
influence of humans. (For rigorous analyses of the concept of indigenous status, see Ratcliffe 1977 
and Peterken 1981.) Contrarily, if a species has been transported (deliberately or not) to a location 
because of human activity and reproduces there without the assistance of humans, it is “introduced” 
(or “naturalized”). A nonindigenous species that occurs with some frequency in an area because it 
is often released or escapes, but does not persist indefinitely because of a lack of adaptation to that 
area, is said to be “spontaneous,” “adventive,” or “casual.” The chief difficulty with determining 
whether a species is indigenous or introduced is the time dimension. Of course, because of geologi-
cal and climate changes during the billions of years of Earth’s history, most species migrated exten-
sively. In many circumstances, indigenous status should be assessed starting with the end of the last 
ice age. However, determining the pre-recorded history location of some plants is very difficult and 
uncertain with respect to the possible influence of humans. Because the precise native homeland of 
C. sativa is unknown with any degree of confidence, and indeed the existence of truly wild forms of 
the species that have never been altered by contact with humans is also not known with confidence, 
traditional treatment in the manner that taxonomists categorize exclusively wild species with known 
primeval distribution ranges is doubtfully warranted.
Possible Relationships among Wild Ancestors, Domesticates, and Escapes
Plants closely related to domesticated plants and growing outside of cultivation may be (1) ances-
tors of the domesticates; (2) escapes from cultivation, either identical to the domesticates or altered 
by generations of selection for existence in nature; or (3) hybrids or introgressants (discussed later) 
between a wild relative and the domesticate. Often, a domesticate arises from a weedy wild spe-
cies, and conversely, often, a weed arises from domesticated plants. When one can distinguish three 
phases: (a) domesticated crop(s), (b) ancestral or closely related (at least somewhat interfertile) wild 
plants that still have natural distribution ranges, and (c) weedy or ruderal relatives of the crop that 
interbreed with it, the assemblage is referred to as a “wild-weed-crop complex.” When only (a) and 
(c) can be distinguished, it is simply a “crop-weed complex.” Many crops like Cannabis exist in 
crop-weed complexes (Andersson and de Vicente 2010), with domesticated forms in cultivation, 
and related ruderal (weedy) forms growing outside of cultivation. The issue of whether all Cannabis 
plants growing outside of cultivation are derived from escapes from cultivation, or whether some of 
these are free of genes altered by humans, cannot be conclusively settled with available information 
(in some respects, it’s like trying to prove a negative). Some botanists have recognized wild-growing 
Cannabis as constituting taxonomic groups at one or more ranks (the most widely used nomencla-
tural epithets for these are kafiristanica, ruderalis, and spontanea), which is also contentious and 
is examined later.
The point of view taken in this book is that no persuasive evidence has been documented that 
there are truly wild populations of C. sativa (pristine genetically, never having been altered by human 
selection, and having natural distributions). By no means are cultivated plants lacking wild ances-
tors unusual: there are hundreds of domesticated plants known only in cultivation. Like Cannabis, 
many other ancient important crops are also thought to lack extant living relatives from which they 
originated directly (which is not to say that they lack living relatives). Examples of familiar crops for 
which direct living ancestors are believed (sometimes debatably) to be extinct include avocado (Persea 
americana), cassava (Manihot esculenta), corn (maize; Zea mays), eggplant (Solanum melongena), 
European plum (Prunus domestica), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), onion (Allium cepa), peanut 
(Arachis hypogaea), rice (Oryza sativa, O. glaberrima), and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius).

Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
Classification Difficulties Due to Hybridization
Hybridization is a genetic combining of representatives of (at least) two different groups. Consider 
the entertaining quotation “if my grandmother had wheels, she’d be a bus” (or bicycle, wagon, or 
tractor), or the Italian counterpart, “If my grandmother had wheels, she would be a wheelbarrow,” 
expressions indicating frustration with someone’s excessive assumptions. Such extreme hybrids are 
difficult to conceptualize (Figure 18.4) but serve to point out that intermediacy between concepts 
challenges their separateness. Hybridization especially complicates classification of crop-weed 
complexes. In biological taxonomy, the term “hybrid” often covers more than simply entities that 
combine two entire genomes (F1 hybrids, i.e., the first-generation progeny generated between the 
pure parental kinds). The term “hybrid” is also frequently applied to a range of backcrosses (crosses 
between the original hybrid and a parent) and segregants (forms with assorted gene combinations 
based on additional crossing). In addition, introgression (gene flow from one population to another), 
a special form of hybridization, often occurs. Frequent hybridization and introgression between 
the cultivated and ruderal phases of crop-weed complexes, and sometimes also between these and 
related wild species, can make classification so difficult that the exercise becomes pointless or 
arbitrary.
In a limited sense, every individual resulting from sexual union is a hybrid between its par-
ents. However, biological classification is concerned not with individuals but with recognizing 
distinctive groups of individuals. No one has succeeded in hybridizing C. sativa with a species 
of any other genus in the Cannabaceae. However, more or less distinctive populations of C. sativa 
do hybridize readily with each other, obscuring differences, and so making the delimitation and 
identification of such populations as distinctive groups (whether labeled as strains, varieties, or 
even species) problematical. The issue of hybridization in C. sativa is examined additionally 
later.

Stereotypical Thinking—A Roadblock to Biological Classification
The classification problems discussed previously regarding hybridization are allied to the issue of 
stereotypical thinking. Stereotypical thinking (better known in philosophical analysis as “typo-
logical thinking”) is a mental set, or way of thinking about things, whereby objects are viewed as 
belonging to perfectly distinctive classes or categories (things are necessarily either this or that, but 
neither both nor something in-between). This is the way most people think most of the time and 
represents an efficient means of understanding the universe. Stereotypical thinking is acceptable so 
long as one has either fish or fowl, but when one is confronted with something which is neither but 
manifests attributes of both, a more sophisticated kind of conceptualization is necessary. Unless 
the reader can evade the mental straitjacket of stereotypical thinking, the true nature of biologi-
cal classification in general, and the classification of Cannabis in particular, cannot be accurately 
understood.
However, it is very difficult for many unfamiliar with the subtleties of biological classification to 
escape stereotypical thinking because conceptualization in terms of discrete entities is embedded 
in normal human psychology. We normally assign individuals to different classes, with no middle 
ground (philosophers refer such thinking to the “law of the excluded middle”). Children viewing 
animals in a farmyard readily perceive different classes of creatures but find a continuous variation 
pattern, such as that presented by the racially intermixed population of people in Hawaii, much 
more difficult to categorize. Like children, many individuals appear unable to conceptualize things 
except in separate classes, and unfortunately, such a rigid mental set precludes appreciation of bio-
logical classification at the species level—the critical classification problem posed by Cannabis. 
Surprisingly perhaps, stereotypical thinking is common among scientists and not uncommon 
among professional taxonomists, although it is almost unknown in theoretically or experimentally 
oriented classification experts. The relationship of stereotypical thinking and biological classifica-
tion is a complex topic and is dealt with in detail in Small (1979a, Chapter 1).
Classification Difficulties Due to Obliteration of Populations by Humans
People often distribute crops to areas where they previously did not exist, providing opportunities 
for genetic exchange with related species and creating habitats (frequently weedy) where hybrids 
will survive. On occasion, the result is the extermination of the genetic differences between once 
distinct groups and their natural distribution ranges. For example, this has happened to alfalfa, a 
complex species in which the two major wild parents were once the distinct species Medicago sativa L. 
and M. falcata L. Over the last six millennia, both in cultivation and in nature, these parental lin-
eages have hybridized so extensively that most plants everywhere are of hybrid origin, one can no 
longer identify the overwhelming majority of plants as belonging to the original species, and so it is 
preferable to reduce the original rank of the parents to subspecies of one species (Small 2011b). The 
carrot species (Daucus carota L.) also illustrates how once distinct classes of domesticated plants 
can be homogenized. More than a century ago, there was a major class of domesticated carrot with 
purplish roots (dominated by anthocyanins) centered in Afghanistan; however, hybridization and 
preference for the familiar European orange carrot (the root pigments dominated by carotenes) have 
virtually eliminated the pure form of purple carrot, except in gene banks (Small 1978b). Cultivated 
assemblages are especially prone to losing their distinctness or simply becoming extinct (Jeffrey 
1968), as their human masters’ needs and tastes change. In Cannabis, hybridization between the 
most distinctive variations has largely obliterated populational differences, especially between the 
two kinds of fiber forms and between the two kinds of marijuana forms. As noted later, the two 
kinds of fiber plants that have been recognized taxonomically have been widely hybridized, by 
legal breeders, because of the resulting heterosis (hybrid vigor), and the two kinds of marijuana 
plants that have been recognized have been widely hybridized (mostly illicitly) to provide for the 
different psychological states that many have come to appreciate and also to generate plants with

desired photoperiodic and size characteristics to meet local needs. Indeed, according to Clarke 
and Merlin (2013), “hybrids have become the predominant form of drug Cannabis grown through-
out Europe and the New World.” Hillig (2004b) concluded that most Cannabis accessions in the 
Vavilov Research Institute (St. Petersburg) germplasm bank (most of these are fiber land races), by 
far the world’s largest such collection, are of hybrid origin. Taxonomy is a practical activity, and 
when most individuals encountered are hybrids, this needs to be considered for classification 
purposes. This means that since the fiber (low-THC) populations of the world are being homog-
enized by hybridization, they are doubtfully split formally into separate taxonomic groups. (The 
difference between formal and nonformal classification is examined later; formal classification 
is indicated by exclusively Latin names, and nonformal, by entirely or partly non-Latin names.) 
Similarly, since the marijuana (moderate- to high-THC) populations of the world are also being 
homogenized by hybridization, it also is inadvisable to split them into formal taxonomic groups. 
Just how to treat the fiber plants collectively and the marijuana plants collectively is examined 
later in this chapter.
Taxonomic Splitting and Rank Inflation
Biological classification frequently involves some degree of subjective assessment and arbitrary 
decision, and this is particularly evident at the species level. Darwin (1859) wrote, “I was much 
struck by how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties… I look 
at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely 
resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given 
to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere indi-
vidual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.” However, this should 
not be interpreted to mean that biological taxonomists lack standards and consistency with respect 
to what constitutes a “species.” As Darwin (1859) also commented, “various definitions…have been 
given of the term species. No one definition has satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows 
vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.” Since Darwin’s time, it has become apparent 
that in practice, human psychology and motivations are important in determining how species are 
recognized, and these factors are discussed in this section.
Even when they agree that a set of organisms is distinctive by virtue of shared traits, taxonomists 
often differ with respect to (1) whether formal nomenclatural recognition is even appropriate and 
(2) if appropriate, the rank that should be assigned (e.g. species or subspecies). Historically and to 
this day, some taxonomists (facetiously referred to as “splitters”) have a “liberal” approach, formally 
recognizing more groupings than would be accepted by most of their professional peers, and con-
versely, some “lumpers” have a “conservative” approach, recognizing fewer groupings than most 
taxonomists consider appropriate (Figure 18.5). Taxonomic splitting is one cause of “taxonomic 
inflation,” the generation of more scientific names than justified.
Splitting is often accompanied by “rank inflation”—the elevation of groupings to a higher rank 
(especially to the species level) than justified (Figure 18.6). Taxonomic splitting and rank elevation 
are attractive to some scientists because these practices amplify the quantity and ranking of taxo-
nomic groups for which they receive credit. However, overrecognition of some groups has resulted 
in distortion of the nature and significance of studies of biodiversity, ecology, and conservation 
(Chaitra et al. 2004; Padial and de la Riva 2006).
Isaac et al. (2004) noted that populations assigned species rather than a lower rank are often 
regarded as more important and that “This encourages elevation to species rank of populations that 
need protection, regardless of whether there is scientific support for this status… Such inflation will 
be biased towards charismatic, large-bodied, rare and endangered forms…that attract high public, 
scientific and conservation interest.” Consistent with this motivation and the fact that Cannabis is 
one of the most charismatic of plants, Hillig (2004b) argued that formal recognition of Chinese fiber 
hemp as a separate taxon “may foster genetic conservation of this agronomically important group.”

FIGURE 18.6  “Rank inflation” is the tendency to enlarge (inflate) membership in the higher, more impor-
tant categories of a hierarchy by excessive promotion of those who properly should be assigned membership 
in lower categories. In this figurative representation (drawn by B. Brookes), an army has too many generals 
in relation to the number of foot soldiers. As noted in the text, the rank of “species” is widely regarded as 
having much more importance than lower ranks, and some taxonomists deliberately elevate variations to spe-
cies rank to emphasize the importance of their study material and consequently their own importance. While 
permissible, this distorts the relative status of such “species” and misleads science and society in regard to 
their nature and status.

The tendency for humans to elevate some high-profile minor entities to the same status as 
major ones is illustrated by the debate over the former planet Pluto, which astronomers voted 
in 2006 to demote to the status of a “dwarf planet” (note Figure 18.7). Although much smaller 
than the eight planets currently recognized (Pluto’s mass is less than a fifth of the Earth’s moon 
and less than one four hundredth of the Earth), there are many who argue that not only should 
Pluto regain its planetary distinction but also that some even smaller neighbors of Pluto should 
be recognized as planets (Stern et al. 2015). What really matters is consistency—whether the 
discipline is biology or astronomy, the standards of the majority of professional scientists should 
be respected.
THE SEMANTIC “LEGAL SPECIES” ISSUE (OR DRESSING 
UP A WOLF IN SHEEP’S CLOTHING)
In the 1970s, a curious forensic debate was founded on splitting what had been widely under-
stood up to that time as the species C. sativa into three species (called C. sativa in a narrow 
nonconventional sense, C. ruderalis Janischevsky, and C. indica Lamarck). In many Western 
countries, legislation governing illicit cannabis preparations defines the material as originating 
from “Cannabis sativa L.” Court cases prior to 1970 witnessed some defenses of individuals 
accused of marijuana offences on the argument that the material in question came from one or 
more “legal species” of Cannabis (i.e., species in addition to C. sativa). This claim failed until 
1971 because of the prevailing opinion (at least in the Western world) that there is only one spe-
cies of Cannabis, C. sativa. However, in 1971, a court challenge was successful, based on the 
testimony of several botanists that there is more than one species of Cannabis. Subsequently, for 
a decade, the legal issue was raised in hundreds of courtrooms, especially in the United States 
and Canada. The ploy was successful because talented lawyers represented taxonomy as simply 
a factual assessment of existential groups called species (hence expert witnesses were sufficient 
to decide the “facts”), whereas in reality, one taxonomist’s species is another’s variety. The issue 
eventually became moot as judges came to realize that recognition of more than one species 
of Cannabis is based merely on splitting of C. sativa into several species and that taxonomic 
opinion on whether splitting is scientifically correct is irrelevant because the intent of legisla-
tion using the name “Cannabis sativa L.” was clearly to designate all forms of Cannabis (and 
certainly the marijuana forms, which many lawyers had speciously argued were exempt from 
prosecution because they belonged to the “legal species” C. indica). In essence, the clever tac-
tic employed was to dress up a wolf (high-THC C. sativa) in the guise of a sheep (low-THC C. 
sativa; see Figure 18.8). The history of the legal-taxonomic debate is detailed in Small (1974, 
1975b,c,d, 1976, 1977, 1979a,b).

DOMESTICATION COMPLICATES CLASSIFICATION
Prior to 1970, there was essential unanimity that only one species of Cannabis merited recognition. 
Since then, virtually without exception, those who have espoused the recognition of more than one 
species of Cannabis have done so without addressing the theory and practices of classification of 
domesticates and their closely related wild populations. Without this background, it is not possible 
to understand clearly the merits of competing systems of classification of Cannabis.
Charles Darwin (1809–1882), the father of evolution, coined the phrase “artificial selection” in 
the first edition of his work On the Origin of Species (Darwin 1859). He concluded that starting from 
a wild species, human selection could produce divergent breeds so spectacularly different that they 
mimicked related species produced by natural selection (compare Darwin’s analysis of wild birds of 
different species, Figure 18.9, and his analysis of domesticated birds of a single species, Figure 18.10). 
Darwin (1859) wrote: “There are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or plants, which 
have not been ranked by some competent judges as…distinct species.” Although he more clearly 
appreciated than anyone previously that classifications of domesticated and wild organisms are debat-
ably comparable, Darwin did not explore the issue of appropriate scientific cataloguing of organisms 
originated by humans. As detailed in the following discussion, the so-called “species” of Cannabis 
that have been recognized are in fact domesticates (i.e., selections made by humans) or their related 
escapes, and accordingly, their recognition as conventional species, while permissible, is misleading.
In common language, “domestication” often refers to taming of wild animals, i.e., habituating 
them to humans so that they are relatively manageable. In biology, domestication is the process 
of choosing individuals of a species that have characteristics making them useful to people, the

Plants under Domestication, Vol. 1., John Murray, London, 1868.

selection usually occurring over generations, so that the desired traits become genetically fixed. 
Almost all important species currently employed in agriculture or for other human purposes are 
domesticated (for examples, see Figure 18.11). Although the phrase “cultivated plant” is widespread 
and is often used to refer to domesticated plants, many cultivated plants are simply wild plants 
that are cultivated, and the different concepts should not be confused. The term “cultigen” has 
been used to refer to domesticates in a broad sense but has been employed in such different ways 
(Spencer 1999; Spencer and Cross 2007a,b) that its use can be confusing. Cultigen can be used to 
refer to all or individually recognizable classes of cultivated plants of a given species that have been 
genetically altered by human selection. As discussed in this chapter, since the cultigens of Cannabis 
intergrade with each other and with widespread weedy forms, all classifications of C. sativa are 
necessarily inexact. Within a cultigen, landraces are (typically) geographical groups that have been 
unconsciously selected over long periods by traditional farmers, and cultivars are (typically) named 
selections produced by breeders or at least deliberately preserved by horticulturalists.

Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
Most domestication has been more or less unconscious, occurring over millennia (Zohary 2004). By 
contrast, deliberate breeding for desired characteristics has become important mainly during the last 100 
years. Whether domestication is in some fundamental way different from natural selection has been the 
subject of debate (reviewed in Ross-Ibara et al. 2007). Domestication is usually conceived of as a form 
of “artificial” selection, which is true if one defines artificial selection as the result of human influence 
that alters the genetics of other species in ways that make them more useful to people. However, some 
(e.g., Darwin 1859; Darlington 1973) have argued that unconscious, i.e., nondeliberate, selective breed-
ing by humans is as “natural” as the selection that occurs in nature. Domestication is, in fact, a form of 
evolution (which can be simply defined as the alteration of gene frequencies over time). Rindos (1984) 
stated, “Domestication clearly cannot be held to be an exclusively human-mediated phenomenon.” This 
is because man is not the only animal that has usurped the freedom of other species, caring for them 
but at the same time altering their genome so that they can be more efficiently exploited as a source of 
food. For example, wood wasps and over 40 species of ambrosia beetles cultivate fungi as food sources 
(they inoculate wood with a fungus which they consume after it has multiplied). Some ants and termites 
also cultivated fungi (see Rindos 1984 and Schultz et al. 2005 for references and additional examples), 
and there are also ant species that herd, protect, and breed mutualistic aphids and other homopterans 
(Hölldolber and Wilson 1990; Schultz and McGlynn 2000; Figure 18.12). In emphasizing that the contrast 
of “artificial selection” and “natural selection” is in fact an artificial distinction, McNeill (1998) stated “It 
is not good evolutionary thinking to suppose that man is not inescapably a part of the ecosystem.”
A COMPARISON OF COMPETING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR CANNABIS
Several botanists have contributed to clarification of the taxonomy of Cannabis in recent decades, 
notably, Small and Cronquist (1976), Small (1979a,b, 2015a), Hillig (2004a,b, 2005a,b), Hillig and 
Mahlberg (2004), McPartland and Guy (2004a), Clarke and Merlin (2013). Based on these studies 
collectively, the following groups of domesticated plants have been recognized as warranting par-
ticular taxonomic attention (compare the postulated ancient Eurasian distribution ranges shown by 
the same numbers in Figure 18.13 and the key information given in Table 18.1A):
	
1.	Hemp plants domesticated for stem fiber (and to a minor extent for oilseed) in western Asia 
and Europe; cannabinoids low in THC and high in cannabidiol (CBD) (part of Small’s 
C. sativa subsp. sativa var. sativa, Hillig’s C. sativa “hemp biotype”)

2.	Hemp plants domesticated for stem fiber (and to a minor extent for oilseed) in East Asia, 
especially China; cannabinoids low to moderate in THC and high in CBD (part of Small’s 
C. sativa subsp. sativa var. sativa, Hillig’s C. indica “hemp biotype,” Clarke and Merlin’s 
C. indica subsp. chinensis)
	
3.	Marijuana plants domesticated in a wide area of south-central Asia for very high THC 
content; cannabinoids mostly or almost completely THC (part of Small’s C. sativa subsp. 
indica var. indica, Hillig’s C. indica “narrow-leaflet drug biotype,” the marijuana trade’s 
“sativa type”)
	
4.	Marijuana plants domesticated in southern Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and neigh-
boring countries, for substantial amounts of both THC and CBD (part of Small’s C. sativa 
subsp. indica var. indica, Hillig’s C. indica “wide-leaflet drug biotype,” the marijuana 
trade’s “indica type”)
In addition, two hybrid classes of cultivated plants have been widely generated: (5) between the 
two hemp groups (1 and 2) and (6) between the two marijuana groups (3 and 4). It should be under-
stood that the hybrid cultivars or strains are not simply first-generation hybrids but represent various 
degrees of stabilized intermediacy, essentially representing all degrees of variation between the 
parental groups, so that there is continuous variation among hemp biotypes and, similarly, continu-
ous variation among marijuana biotypes.

tion concerning the evolution, classification, and nomenclature of these groups is presented in this chapter.

SEMANTIC DIFFICULTIES CONCERNING SATIVA TYPE 
AND INDICA TYPE CANNABIS SATIVA
Sativa type and indica type marijuana strains are contrasted in detail in Chapter 12. Beginning with 
the rise of marijuana as the leading illicit counterculture drug in the 1960s and persisting to the pres-
ent day with marijuana strains being marketed in the quasi-legal and legal medicinal markets, there 
has been a fundamental confusion in much of the popular literature over what the terms “sativa” 
and “indica” designate. Taxonomists have utilized the epithets sativa and indica to distinguish two 
taxa (taxonomic groups), the term “sativa” traditionally designating nonintoxicating hemp plants in 
contrast to the term “indica,” which has been used to designate marijuana plants. The marijuana 
trade, however, uses both “sativa” and “indica” as labels for different classes of marijuana plants 
and (contradictory to taxonomic tradition) uses the term “sativa” to designate plants with more 
intoxicating potential (i.e., very high THC content, low or no CBD content) and the term “indica” to 
designate plants with less but still substantial intoxicating potential (i.e., moderate THC content and 
moderate CBD content). Without appreciation of these contradictory usages, it is often impossible 
for botanists familiar with taxonomic terminology to understand the information in popular articles 
that use the terms “indica” and “sativa.” Indeed, the authors of some recent scientific publications 
clearly were confused about what the terms do and do not designate, and if professional scientists 
are confused, it is understandable that the general public is also uncertain.
HOMOGENIZATION DUE TO GENE FLOW
The domesticated groups of Cannabis mentioned previously are of Eurasian origin but, especially in 
the last several hundred years, have been transported to and cultivated in much of the world. In many 
regions, they have escaped, reevolved characteristics suited to wild existence, and established as 
self-perpetuating populations outside of cultivation. Because both domesticated and wild Cannabis 
populations are extremely widespread, interbreed spontaneously over vast distances, have a common 
diploid chromosome number (2n = 20), and possess no biological barriers to interbreeding (Small 
1972a), wild-growing and domesticated plants exchange genes easily and extensively. In nature, one 
finds a complete spectrum of intermediate forms, demonstrating continuity of variation between wild 
and domesticated forms (Small 1975a). Sawler et al. (2015) found genetic evidence of intergrada-
tion between the indica type and sativa type forms of high-THC marijuana. Because domesticated 
selections are highly susceptible to gene influx from other domesticated selections and from wild-
growing forms, to maintain their characteristics, they must be protected from “genetic contamina-
tion.” Genetic infiltration into Cannabis from wild populations has not actually been demonstrated 
but has been confirmed in Humulus (Small 1980, 1981), the very close relative of Cannabis, and there 
is no reason why the two should be different in this respect. Moreover, as with many other crops 
(and domesticated animals), the mutations selected by humans are usually advantageous to humans 
but disadvantageous to the plants, and unless stabilizing selection is practiced, natural selection can 
result in degeneration or reversion (sometimes termed “atavism”) of the genome, with wild character-
istics appearing in cultivated plants. Patterns of gene change from various factors are summarized in 
Figure 18.14. The extensive intergradation that has resulted from interbreeding is the chief cause of 
classification difficulties. The following presentation is concerned primarily with the arrangement of 
the domesticated groups and wild populations into a classification and naming system.
ALTERNATIVE TAXONOMIC AND NOMENCLATURAL TREATMENTS
The professional taxonomic treatment of plants (indeed of all living things) is largely a standard-
ized activity, involving three phases. The first phase is grouping (recognition of assemblages). The 
second phase is ordering of these assemblages, conventionally in a hierarchical system (like a series 
of smaller boxes within progressively larger boxes), involving fixed ranks (e.g., subspecies, species, 
 

463
Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
genus, and family), although as noted later, there are other kinds of arrangements. The third and final 
phase is naming: the provision of appropriate nomenclature in an unambiguous manner that reflects 
the nature of the classification system. The possibilities differ somewhat according to the rules of 
current nomenclatural codes (for general information on nomenclatural codes for the principal kinds 
of organisms, see David et al. 2012). In the case of Cannabis, two botanical nomenclatural codes 
are particularly relevant, as well as noncodified classification systems, as discussed in the following.
Cannabis Assemblages as Conventional Taxa
Beginning with a code governing botanical nomenclature prepared in 1867, improved interna-
tionally accepted versions have been published periodically. The latest is The International Code 
of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (ICNAFP; McNeill et al. 2012). This is the most 
respected and universally applied way of determining plant names (the third phase of taxonomic 
procedures mentioned in the previous paragraph). There is no impediment to treating groups that are 
completely or partly domesticated under this code. All groups that are recognized are assigned a par-
ticular rank, and the Latin name (if not newly coined) is determined by examining all eligible names 
that correspond with the group that have previously been accepted and by reference to the rules of the 
code to determine the single, correct name. The code specifies the conventions that must be followed 
for naming taxonomic groups, but different taxonomists can disagree about which individuals fall 
within given groups (i.e., the circumscription of groups) and about the hierarchical organization (i.e., 
ranks assigned to groups), and these disagreements can mean that a given plant may be identified 
“correctly” but differently by different taxonomists and that a given plant name can be interpreted

ticated races of C. sativa. (1) Humans cultivate selections, principally for stem fiber, oilseed, and intoxicating 
resin. (2) Such selections retain their desirable characteristics only if maintained by stabilizing selection (shown 
here for simplicity only for the oilseed form). (3) In recent times, deliberate hybridization among oilseed and 
fiber kinds has generated valuable new selections. (4) In the absence of stabilizing selection, cultivated plants 
are likely to undergo populational genetic changes over several generations that are undesirable agriculturally 
(degenerative) since the highly selected characters of interest to humans are usually deleterious to the plants 
(for simplicity, such degeneration is shown only for the oilseed form). (5) Genes from cultivated plants may be 
released to the uncultivated gene pool. Selections may escape directly from cultivation and reestablish popula-
tions outside of cultivation, or pollen from cultivated selections may fertilize wild plants (for simplicity, such 
gene escape is shown only for the oilseed form). (6) Pollen from uncultivated plants may fertilize a cultivated 
selection, reducing the desired characteristics of the latter (for simplicity, this is shown only for the oilseed form). 
(7) Pollen from cultivated plants with undesirable characteristics (e.g., from clandestine marijuana plants) may 
pollinate a cultivated selection (e.g., grown for fiber or oilseed), reducing the desired characteristics of the latter.

differently by different taxonomists. When a name has been used in different senses so extensively 
that it is a source of confusion, Article 57 of the ICNAFP provides for stabilizing usage of or simply 
abandoning that name. Certainly, there has been extensive confusion over how to use some of the 
species names associated with Cannabis, but no one has yet suggested that Article 57 be applied.
Some traditional taxonomists (especially in Europe in the twentieth century) subcategorized 
important crop plants in very extensive, multilevel hierarchies, either formally (i.e., in strict con-
formity with the botanical code) or quasi-formally. Sometimes, hundreds of groups were recog-
nized. Examples of categories that have been used are presented in Jirásek (1961); examples and a 
critique of excessively complex treatments are presented in Spooner et al. (2003). The eccentricity 
and unworkability of this approach led to efforts to find a standardized, simple way of classifying 
the variation within cultivated plants in relation to their wild relatives (but with limited success, as 
noted in the following discussion).
A particular issue that has troubled plant taxonomists is how to categorize groups in which 
there are both wild and domesticated kinds using traditional formal categories. There have been 
many proposals. For example, Harlan and de Wet (1971) suggested that where both ruderal and 
domesticated races exist within one species, all of the ruderal races should be recognized as a col-
lective subspecies, and similarly, all of the domesticated forms should be placed in a collective culti-
vated subspecies. Similarly, Nesom (2011) treated apparent wild progenitors and their domesticated 
derivatives in the family Cucurbitaceae as separate subspecies of a given species. However, there is 
no agreed way of taxonomically separating domesticated plants and their close wild relatives and 
indeed very limited prospects for the adoption of a universal solution to this issue.
Cannabis Cultivar Assemblages as “Groups” under the Cultivated Plant Code
Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the father of modern taxonomy, was aware that some species included 
domesticated forms differing from those found in nature. He was disinterested, indeed hostile, 
to the expansion of his method of designating species by binomial names to domesticated plants 
(Hetterscheid et al. 1996). Notably, Linnaeus used Latin phrases (mostly with more than the two 
terms he standardly employed in binary species names) to describe 12 kinds of Brassica oleracea 
(Linnaeus 1753), which include wild plants as well as distinctive domesticated crops known as coles, 
cabbages, and kohlrabis (Oost 1989). (Today, Linnaeus’ cabbage-type groups have been assigned to 
the formal category varietas, a rank translated as variety [var.], although widely confused with the 
vernacular nonformal term “variety,” which is equivalent to the term “cultivar”.) As noted previ-
ously, plant taxonomists have not reached a consensus on how to classify plants in which there are 
both domesticated and wild representatives.
Confronted by a growing body of plant names applied to cultivated plants, taxonomists created 
a special code using non-Latin or “fancy” names (Stearn 1952). Since the middle of the twentieth 
century, domesticated selections of plants termed “cultivars,” which satisfy certain descriptive and 
publication requirements, have been the subject of a special, at least partly non-Latinized, code of 
nomenclature (International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants; ICNCP; latest edition: 
Brickell et al. 2009). The ICNCP provides the following definition: “A cultivar is an assemblage of 
plants that (a) has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters, (b) is dis-
tinct, uniform, and stable in these characters, and (c) when propagated by appropriate means, retains 
those characters.” Article 9.1, Note 1, restricts the meaning of cultivar as follows: “No assemblage 
of plants can be regarded as a cultivar…until its category, name, and circumscription has [sic] been 
published.” (Webster’s Third New International Dictionary [Gove 1981] provides a more general 
definition of a cultivar: “an organism of a kind [as a variety, strain, or race] that has originated and 
persisted under cultivation.”) Cultivars as defined by the ICNCP can be of quite different nature 
(e.g., they may be hybrids, clones, grafts [i.e., combinations of species], chimeras [with genetically 
different tissues], and even plants that are distinct simply because they are infected by a microor-
ganism), but frequently, many of the cultivars within a given species differ very little genetically

Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
from each other. There are more than a hundred recognized cultivars of nonintoxicating forms of 
Cannabis, currently grown for fiber and/or oilseed (many are listed in Table 17.3). Only a hand-
ful of forms bred for authorized medicinal usage at present are regarded as cultivars under the 
ICNCP (there are also numerous breeding lines that are not afforded cultivar recognition). There are 
also over a thousand illicit or quasi-licit marijuana “strains” (or at least allegedly different strains) 
that are currently circulated in the black, gray, and medicinal marijuana trades (as noted earlier, 
Cannabis strains are biologically equivalent to cultivars, although not nomenclaturally). Many culti-
vated plants of Cannabis are “land races”—populations domesticated in a locale, typically selected 
over long periods by unconscious (nonplanned, undeliberate) selection by traditional farmers, usu-
ally adapted to local stresses, and often much more variable than modern cultivars. (In numerous 
crops, land races have provided the raw materials from which cultivars have been selected.) The 
ICNCP does not adequately address nomenclature for land races (unless they have been recognized 
as cultivars, which is quite infrequent) but does provide a context for classifying and naming culti-
vars. There is no provision under the cultivated plant code for special recognition of uncultivated, 
wild (ruderal) plants, but it is understood that nomenclature for the wild phases of a species nor-
mally falls under the comprehensive plant code (ICNAFP). As noted later, the ICNCP is mainly 
concerned with names of plant groups that differ mostly in minor ways (terms such as “biotype” or 
“strain” are usually applicable). Except for the “group” category discussed next, the ICNCP has not 
served to address the issue of names for major divisions of domesticated plants within species or 
species groups, nor how to distinguish such major divisions from related wild plants.
The cultivated plant code (ICNCP) has been the subject of debate, particularly as it relates to the 
plant code applying to all plants (ICNAFP). There have been attempts to introduce a parallel term, 
“culton,” for the term “taxon” (see McNeill 1998 for a critique). Mostly in the past, cultivars were some-
times grouped in “convarieties,” a troublesome category because it has been used to indicate rank 
according to the comprehensive nomenclatural code for plants. A peculiarity of the ICNCP, pointed out 
by McNeill (2004), is that it does “not presume that desirable groupings are necessarily non-overlapping” 
(i.e., according to Article 3.4, a given cultivar can simultaneously belong to more than one group).
A key feature of the ICNCP provides for recognition of “groups” of cultivars, allowing consider-
able flexibility in their formation (“Criteria for forming and maintaining a group vary according to 
the required purposes of particular users”) but insisting that “All members of a Group must share 
the character(s) by which that Group is defined.” (A special group category, “grex,” applies only to 
horticultural hybrids of orchids.) The group concept is flexible in choice of characters serving to 
define membership (of course, there may be disagreements among specialists about which charac-
ters should be the basis for group recognition). Because the group concept of the cultivated plant 
code has only a single rank (really no rank), it does not provide for using taxonomic rankings as an 
indication of phylogenetic history.
The group concept provides a simple, sound alternative way of labeling variation of domesticated 
forms in the genus Cannabis. It eliminates the need to consider rank; what various authors may 
have treated as species, subspecies, or varieties can be reduced to the same level. The four domesti-
cated assemblages noted in Table 18.1A can simply be recognized as groups. There is considerable 
hybridization in Cannabis, which often makes identification problematical, but the same is true of 
most important domesticated plants. Groups that are hybrids between other groups can simply be 
recognized as separate groups.
The following classification accounts for variations of domesticated forms of C. sativa, under 
the cultivated plant code, with synonymous terminology shown in parenthesis (the designation of 
groups by number is consistent in this chapter; cf. Figure 18.13 and Table 18.1). The same classifica-
tion was presented in Small (2015a) but with different terminology.

Crop-Wild Assemblages as Nonformal Groups
“Formal” taxonomic treatment refers to the strict use of the categories and nomenclatural conven-
tions for designating groups of organisms specified in at least one of the codes of nomenclature 
governing plants. “Informal” classification refers to organizational and naming systems that do not 
conform to one of the codes.
A number of theorists of plant classification have espoused the view that classification of crop-wild 
complexes, in which there is at least some interbreeding, is preferably carried out informally (also 
note the discussion later of natural and artificial classification). There are endless definitions of “spe-
cies,” no universally accepted criterion or criteria for this fundamental grouping, and considerable 
heterogeneity in the nature of groups that are called species. Nevertheless, the ability to interbreed and 
the actual degree to which interbreeding occurs are critical considerations in recognizing species of 
plants because gene exchange among populations tends to eliminate the differences that are employed 
to define species. The so-called “biological species concept” defines species on the basis of actual or 
potential breeding separateness (and clearly, on this basis, there is only one species of Cannabis). Above 
the biological species level, evolution is largely bifurcating (although there is debate about the degree to 
which hybridization among groups at the genus level and above has occurred), a pattern that is compat-
ible with the hierarchical structure of conventional plant taxonomy. However, some systematists (e.g., 
Minelli 1993; Pickersgill et al. 2003) have concluded that variants below the biological species level 
(often classified as subspecies and varieties) are usually not generated in a hierarchical fashion, either 
in nature or in cultivation, and so using more than one infraspecific rank for crop-weed complexes, as 
has been commonly done in an attempt to reflect evolutionary patterns, is usually unjustified.
Harlan and de Wet (1971), frustrated with the inconsistent treatment of crops and their closely 
related wild relatives, proposed a nonformal system of classification, which is in fact an elaboration 
of the biological species concept (Spooner et al. 2003). Their so-called “gene pool classification” 
recognizes (a) a “primary genepool,” based on the crop and wild populations (whether or not rec-
ognized as different species) that interbreed readily with it (Harlan and de Wet characterized their 
primary gene pool as equivalent to the traditional biological species concept); (b) a “secondary 
genepool,” made up of populations that can interbreed with the crop but only with some difficulty; 
and (c) a “tertiary genepool,” made up of populations that can interbreed with the crop but only 
with considerable difficulty (this group is the equivalent of a “coenospecies” in the terminology of 
Clausen et al. 1948). Harlan and de Wet further proposed a scheme of hierarchical subpartitioning 
using nonformal categories (i.e., independent of the codes of nomenclature). No one has succeeded 
in hybridizing C. sativa with any other species in the Cannabaceae, and all plants of Cannabis 
interbreed freely, so classification of Cannabis according to Harlan and de Wet’s concept is simple: 
all plants belong to the primary genepool of the one biological species, C. sativa.
 

467
Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
Jeffrey (1968), consistent with his view that “cultivated plants differ from one another so greatly in 
their variation patterns that a formal system applicable to all is not only impossible but undesirable,” 
recommended a nonformal system of classification with a maximum of two hierarchical categories 
to classify cultivars and a new term (“subspecioid”) to separate the domesticated from the related 
wild-growing plants. Other schemes have been proposed to treat crop classification in ways that are 
distinctive from the conventional way of classifying wild plants (for examples, see Styles 1986; for 
reviews, see Hetterscheid et al. 1996 and Hammer and Morimoto 2012). A comprehensive nonfor-
mal classification system for Cannabis has not yet been proposed.
OCCAM’S RAZOR IN RELATION TO THE EVOLUTION 
AND CLASSIFICATION OF CANNABIS
Conventional biological classifications are, at least to some degree, scientific hypotheses theorizing 
that certain individuals deserve to be grouped together based on consideration of all or some of their 
characteristics. In scientific theory, Occam’s (Ockham’s) razor is a recommendation that expla-
nations be as simple as possible, limiting unproven assumptions (Figure 18.15). (Einstein’s razor, 
variously phrased, holds that scientific explanations should be as simple as consistent with facts.) 
Stephen Hawking, in his classic A Brief History of Time, wrote “It seems better to employ the prin-
ciple known as Occam’s razor and cut out all the features of the theory that cannot be observed.” 
The following are chief, unnecessary presumptions or assumptions that have contributed to confu-
sion concerning the evolution and classification of Cannabis.
	
1.	Assertion: There are wild plants growing outside of cultivation that coincide with pre­
domestication populations, and so these can be recognized as conventional taxa (species, 
subspecies, or varieties).
	
	
Observations: There might be genuinely wild Cannabis plants that are completely or 
substantially unaffected by domestication, but no one has demonstrated their existence. 
It is commonplace for crops that have been domesticated for very long periods to lack 
any evidence of genuinely wild (not merely escaped-ruderal) extant ancestral populations. 
Given the long history, extensive distribution of Cannabis by humans and the ease of 
genetic exchange between cultivated and uncultivated populations, it is unlikely that unal-
tered wild forms still exist.
	
2.	Assertion: The four basic domesticated groups of Cannabis were generated over past mil-
lennia from different genuinely wild ancestral populations.
“No more things
should be presumed
to exist than are
absolutely necessary.”

Cannabis: A Complete Guide
	
	
Observations: This viewpoint is adopted extensively by Clarke and Merlin (2013), who 
assign formal scientific names to seven putatively wild ancestors (including the putative 
ancestor of all forms of Cannabis) of the four domesticated groups recognized in this 
review, while conceding that these are “either extant and unrecognized or extinct.” The far 
simpler and more likely explanation is that humans generated the domesticated groups from 
a single original wild species, as indeed is the case for innumerable domesticated plants.
HOW MANY SPECIES OF CANNABIS MERIT RECOGNITION?
In much of the literature debating the issue of how many species of Cannabis deserve recognition, 
the viewpoint that there are several species has been termed the “polytypic species” concept, and 
the view that there is just one has been called the “monotypic” view. This is simply a misinterpreta-
tion of the term “polytypic,” which in taxonomy simply means that a group is composed of several 
elements (taxa or races). A polytypic genus has more than one species; a polytypic species has 
more than one infraspecific taxon, or is simply variable, containing more than one kind. A genus 
with more than one species is correctly described as polyspecific; a genus with just one species is 
monospecific.
Much of the preceding discussion explains that the contention that there are several species of 
Cannabis is simply a semantic preference, not dictated just by scientific considerations, and that tax-
onomists are familiar with such competing taxonomic interpretations. However, most taxonomists 
are suspicious of alleged species that are 100% interfertile, as are the putative species of Cannabis. 
More critically, when no one has provided a reliable means of morphologically distinguishing the 
proposed species, few taxonomists would accept their recognition. There is no supreme organiza-
tion or authority that judges the comparative merit of given taxonomic treatments. However, com-
peting taxonomies are judged by users, the most knowledgeable of which are those who prepare 
guides to the flora of regions. Today, virtually all authoritative floras recognize only one species 
of Cannabis, C. sativa (see, for example, Qaiser 1973; Tutin and Edmonson 1993; Small 1997; 
Wu et al. 2003), indicating that the designation of more than one species is inappropriate by contem-
porary standards. Moreover, as stated by De Meijer (2014): “A monospecific concept…has implic-
itly been adopted in virtually all, nontaxonomic, publications on Cannabis… The current pattern of 
Cannabis diversity is primarily due to intentional actions of humans and reflects a long, intense, and 
divergent process of domestication which has blurred any natural evolutionary pattern of diversity. 
It is even questionable if truly wild Cannabis still exists.”
As discussed previously, the recognition of more than one species of Cannabis is typical of the 
overclassification of domesticated crops. Harlan and de Wet (1971) wrote about this problem: “Man 
has been very active in manipulating the gene pools through repeated introductions or migrations, 
followed by natural or artificial hybridization. The germ plasm of domesticated plants has been 
repeatedly and periodically stirred. The environment provided has been artificial, unstable and 
often very extensive geographically. Selection pressures have been very strong, but biologically 
capricious and often in diverse directions. The end result is an enormous amount of conspicuous 
variation among very closely related forms. Faced with this situation, the traditional taxonomist 
tends to overclasssify. He finds conspicuous either-or characters, often without intermediates, and 
frequently bases ‘species’ on them. The characters may be controlled by one or a few genes and have 
little biological significance. Too many species and too many genera are named.”
Based on multivariate statistical similarities of allozyme frequency, Hillig (2005a,b) separated 
European fiber plants from the three more easterly domesticated groups: the two marijuana groups 
and Chinese fiber plants. Additional but less clear support for this separation was found by examina-
tion of terpene chemistry (Hillig 2004a) and cannabinoid chemistry (Hillig and Mahlberg 2004), 
and the evidence was clearer for cultivated accessions than for ruderal ones. In these studies, Hillig 
assigned the European fiber plants to “C. sativa” and the three eastern groups to “C. indica,” noting 
that this had the unexpected effect of combining within C. indica the two marijuana groups and 
 

469
Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
Chinese hemp. Hillig’s data are valuable in indicating that there was probably in ancient times a 
genetic differentiation trend between the plants of western Eurasia (and consequently Europe) and 
those of eastern Eurasia. Likely, European hemp went through a genetic bottleneck as it was being 
selected from the more eastern plants. However, by evolutionary standards, this trend seems very 
minor, since not a single reliable character has been found to distinguish the western (European) and 
eastern kinds collectively, nor has a combination of morphological characters been suggested that 
could serve to separate them reliably, as is necessary in conventional plant taxonomic identification 
keys. Recent DNA evidence does indicate that at the molecular level, combined genetic loci may be 
usable to discriminate European hemp strains, indica type plants, and sativa type plants (Lynch et 
al. 2015; Sawler et al. 2015). The situation is perhaps analogous to human blood group geography, 
thought to have resulted from a combination of random drift and selection for disease resistance 
(Anstee 2010), and certainly not warranting formal taxonomic recognition. The information is, 
however, useful for tracing genetic relationships and identifying strains and cultivars.
A RATIONALE FOR EMPHASIZING THE PRINCIPAL SELECTED 
CHARACTER COMPLEXES IN CLASSIFICATION
Aside from groups resulting from hybrid origin or lateral gene transfer, it is usually assumed that 
organisms sharing a unique set of characteristics arose from a single ancestor. Indeed, the cladistics 
school of classification insists that recognized taxonomic groups must have a single origin and uses 
a phyletic pattern of bifurcating groups as the theoretical justification for hierarchical classification. 
However, adaptive gene complexes within taxonomic groups frequently appear to have arisen recur-
rently, i.e., repeatedly, independently, and in parallel (e.g., Levin 2001; Arendt and Reznick 2007). 
Many crops appear to have arisen repeatedly and independently within the same species (Diamond 
2002). In the long course of history, fiber strains of Cannabis were probably selected indepen-
dently in different geographic regions, and the same is likely true for marijuana strains, a phyletic 
pattern that is not hierarchical in organization and reflects the difficulty of classifying variation 
within many species. In arguing against the application of hierarchical classification below the spe-
cies level, Jeffrey (1968) pointed out: “Similar selection pressures, operating on genetically similar 
but distinct lines, may evoke similar responses in those lines, giving rise to parallel variation, the 
homologous series of Vavilov, a phenomenon by no means confined to cultivated plants, but often 
exhibited by them to a marked degree.” This consideration complicates the classification of crop 
complexes because it means that critical aspects of the genome may be arrayed in complex ways 
within a group, and taxonomic recognition of this partitioning may be a debatable issue.
In biological taxonomy, “natural classifications” (sometimes termed general classifications) 
are based on overall genetic similarities and/or phylogeny, while so-called “artificial” or “special-­
purpose” classifications are based on selected similarities of particular (practical) interest to people. 
Artificial classification is unrelated to the concept of artificial selection and is a phrase sometimes 
used pejoratively to indicate that the merit of such classifications is limited. It is often claimed that 
restricting the character base to only certain economic considerations means that the resulting clas-
sification is not based on evolution and so not an acceptable basis for biological taxonomy. However, 
characteristics of domesticated organisms are the result of evolution, and when they are produced 
by strong selective pressures, they may merit special taxonomic consideration. This is important for 
classifying domesticated plants, particularly for Cannabis, because biological taxonomy is, above 
all, intended to convey information, and for useful plants like crops, the most useful information 
often resides in a particular aspect of the genome, not necessarily the entire genome. Characters or 
character complexes that are selected by humans are adaptive for domesticated plants, at least in the 
context of cultivation, and using such characters in recognizing taxa does constitute evolutionary 
classification. For Cannabis, my own classification summarized in the following is based on the 
recurrent selective pressures (and associated gene selection) for stem fiber or THC content (between 
groups of domesticated plants) and for achene retention or shattering (between wild and cultivated

plants). These principal selective evolutionary pressures on Cannabis are responsible for the genera-
tion of the most obvious and important variation within the genus and are accordingly appropriate 
bases for taxonomic delimitation.
A PRACTICAL AND NATURAL TAXONOMY FOR CANNABIS
The following four-group taxonomic subdivision of Cannabis under the ICNAFP code (based on 
Small and Cronquist 1976) is an alternative to the six-group classification under the ICNCP code 
presented in the preceding. The key presented first divides the one species recognized into two 
groups on the basis of THC and CBD content. As noted in Chapter 11, the genetic determination of 
these compounds is probably under the partial genetic control of codominant alleles, and this may 
provoke the criticism that the division on the basis of predominant cannabinoid is essentially a 
“one-character taxonomy” (a rather pejorative phrase in classification science). Keys are, by their 
nature, simplifications of available knowledge and necessarily limit characters used for identifica-
tion. As discussed in this book, there are in fact numerous trends that differ between plants of the 
hemp class and those of the marijuana class.
As shown in Figure 18.16, divergent selection for high THC content and high stem fiber content 
represents a principal dimension of disruptive evolutionary forces that are responsible for differences 
in Cannabis. All plants domesticated for fiber tend to share a common set of selected characters (e.g., 
primary fiber constitutes a large percentage of the stem, CBD makes up a large percentage of the 
cannabinoids, THC rarely is present in large amounts, and the plants are photoperiodically adapted to 
flower in relatively high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere), and all plants domesticated for intoxi-
cating effect tend to share a different set of contrasting characters (e.g., secondary, not primary fiber 
constitutes a large percentage of the stem, THC makes up a large percentage of the cannabinoids, 
and photoperiodic adaptation is usually for relatively lower latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere).
As shown in Figure 18.17, divergent selection for “seed” (achene) shattering (separation from the 
maternal plant) in ruderal plants and achene retention in domesticated plants is a second principal 
dimension of disruptive selection in Cannabis (reflective of a more general disruptive selection for 
existence in cultivation or existence in nature).
The two kinds of disruptive selection described in the preceding paragraphs are combined in the 
classification shown in Figure 18.18.

Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
Regarding THC concentration, diagnostic for subspecies: as discussed in Chapter 11, THC con-
centration in C. sativa is known to vary somewhat with environment, maturity, and other factors, 
and often there are differences among plants of a population. A minimum level of 1% is indicative 
of plants that can be used to prepare marijuana, and frequently, it is known whether material avail-
able is used for marijuana usage and is therefore assignable to subsp. indica. Most fiber and oilseed 
cultivars (with the exception of some East Asian cultivars), by contrast, have less than 1% and are 
assignable to subsp. sativa.
Regarding achenes (“seeds”), diagnostic for varieties: Only substantially mature achenes exhibit 
the identification characteristics clearly. In the North Temperate region of the world, geography 
alone frequently serves to distinguish the cultivated from the wild varieties of a given subspecies: 
in North America, plants growing in uncultivated situations north of 30° latitude are almost always 
var. spontanea, and in Eurasia, the same is true for plants growing in uncultivated situations north 
of 35° latitude. Wild-growing plants in southern Asia and northern Africa are frequently var. kaf-
iristanica. In many other areas of the world, wild populations are derived from escapes either from 
cultivated high-THC or low-THC strains, and an analysis of THC levels is required for identification.

Since there is extensive intergradation among the taxa, the classification is necessarily inexact 
(some plants or populations will be found to be intermediate and not easily assigned to one of the 
groups, but this is a well-known limitation of classifying groups within a species).
Identification Key to Subspecies and Varieties of C. sativa L.
	
1.	Plants of limited intoxicant ability, Δ9-THC usually comprising less than 0.3% (dry weight) 
of upper third of flowering plants (sometimes up to 1%) and usually less than half of canna-
binoids of resin. Plants cultivated for fiber or oil or growing wild in regions where such cul-
tivation has occurred ................................................................................. C. sativa subsp. sativa
	
	
2.  Mature achenes relatively large, seldom less than 3.8 mm long, tending to be persis-
tent, without a basal constricted zone, not mottled or marbled, the perianth poorly adher-
ent to the pericarp and frequently more or less sloughed off

2.  Mature achenes relatively small, commonly less than 3.8 mm long, readily disarticu-
lating from the pedicel, with a more or less definite, short, constricted zone toward the 
base, tending to be mottled or marbled in appearance because of irregular pigmented 
areas of the largely persistent and adnate perianth

CURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
•	 Bacteria sometimes colonize the interiors of plant roots, reminiscent of endomycorrhi-
zal fungi (endomycorrhizae). Such bacteria have been shown to be capable of taxonomic 
discrimination among marijuana strains of C. sativa, showing preferences for some over 
others (Winston et al. 2014).
•	 The butterfly Pieris brassicae has also been shown to have some ability to recognize differ-
ent kinds of C. sativa. It has been observed to prefer to oviposit its eggs into a fiber Turkish 
strain by comparison with an intoxicating Mexican strain (Rothschild and Fairbairn 1980).
•	 Tiger moths (Arctia caja) have proven to have poor ability to discriminate kinds of 
C. sativa. Experimentally given a choice of consuming a high-THC strain of C. sativa, 
which proved fatal, and a low-THC strain that they were able to tolerate, they committed 
suicide by choosing the former (Rothschild et al. 1977).

Botanical Classification and Nomenclatural Issues
•	 Plant taxonomists often deposit reference specimens in herbaria to document their obser-
vations. Such specimens often serve as vouchers, which can be studied to determine the 
accuracy of conclusions. A good example of this is what was alleged to be a peculiar vari-
ant of “Cannabis” found on a herbarium sheet housed in the Field Museum of Natural 
history in Chicago. The plant was determined to actually be a male Datisca cannabina, 
which is a remarkable mimic of C. sativa (Small 1975e; Figure 1.19b).
•	 About 1.4 million species have been named to date, most of them with unmemorable 
names. However, biological taxonomists sometimes compose humorous names, for exam-
ple, Abra cadabra (a clam), Ba humbugi (a snail), Oedipus complex (a salamander), Pieza 
pi (a fly), and Pison eu (a wasp). For additional examples, see Isaak, M. Curiosities of bio-
logical nomenclature: http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/index.html.
•	 What appear to be legitimate scientific names for species are sometimes just not accepted 
by science because of a lack of evidence. In most cases, the most tangible evidence required 
is a “type specimen,” a physical sample or, at least in some cases, an illustration. The Loch 
Ness monster (note Figure 18.19) was described as Nessiteras rhombopteryx in 1975 based 
on an alleged underwater photo, and if one day this is proven to have been a truthful obser-
vation, the name would be valid.
