Preface
Preface
e aim of the book is to provide first degree engineering students with the foundations on refrigeration 
engineering. It covers the basic principles in refrigeration and is not intended to provide specialized 
knowledge on the subject. Students who further their studies on refrigeration shall still find this book as a 
good reference. Refrigeration courses could be part of a mechanical, chemical or for instance ­energy eng-
ineering courses. e philosophy employed throughout the entire book is to provide a modern approach 
to the subject. e later chapters provide fundamental knowledge of refrigeration system simulations. 
is can be considered as a more advanced topic which is usually more useful to the ­Masters degree 
student. Nonetheless, the material presented is comprehensive and will give students a good background 
of modelling refrigeration systems.

Fundamentals of refrigeration  
thermodynamics
Preface
e book is structured into eight chapters. Chapters 1–3 provide some background thermodynamic 
knowledge required for refrigeration systems engineering. Chapters 4 and 5 are the core chapters of 
the book which focus on the various refrigeration cycles which are most commonly used. Chapter 6 is 
an introduction to chapters 7 and 8 which are focused on numerical modelling of vapour compression 
and vapour absorption systems. e soware used for the implementation of the mathematical models 
is MathWorks®MATLAB. e following is an overview of the chapters in the book:
1.	 Fundamentals of thermodynamics – e basic thermodynamic principles are presented 
here. e topics covered are suﬃcient for what will be used throughout the text when 
analyzing refrigeration systems. Since in most cases, students taking courses in refrigeration 
have a good thermodynamics background, this chapter is aimed to provide a revision of the 
salient points in thermodynamics.
2.	 Heat engines and reversed heat engines – is chapter aims at complementing  
chapter 1 and exposes the fundamental principles of heat engines and reversed heat engines. 
ermodynamic cycles are also introduced which will also be very important to describe 
refrigeration units.
3.	 Working fluids – e working fluids and their thermodynamic characteristics are described 
in this chapter. e properties of refrigerants and environmental issues associated with them 
are discussed.
4.	 Vapour compression cycles – e basic vapour compression refrigeration cycle is here 
presented in detail. More advanced multi-stage cycles are also introduced. e inclusion 
of a description on heat pumps is inevitable even though the book is only dedicated to 
refrigeration.
5.	 Vapour absorption and other cycles – Vapour absorption cycles as well as other, less 
common refrigeration methods are discussed to give the student a broad overview of 
refrigeration systems other than vapour compression cycles.
6.	 Principles of numerical modelling and experimentation – is chapter serves as an 
introduction to the final chapters of the book. Such topics are becoming ever so important 
with the widespread use of computer programs to analyze thermodynamic systems.
7.	 Vapour compression system modelling – In this chapter, mathematical modelling of the 
vapour compression systems is discussed. e possibility to analyze a large number of test 
cases is emphasized and the behaviour of these systems with respect to various parameters 
is considered.
8.	 Vapour absorption system modelling – is chapter follows the same organization as 
chapter 7 but this time focussed on vapour absorption cycles.

Fundamentals of thermodynamics
A thermodynamic system involves a collection of matter which is distinct from its surroundings by means 
of a boundary. Figure 1.1 depicts the system and its separation from the surroundings by means of a 
boundary. The boundary can either be fixed or moving. Thermodynamic systems have varying functions 
such as converting heat energy into work or converting work into heat energy. The elements making up 
such as system are known as sub-systems. In a closed system, no matter is allowed to enter or leave the 
system and hence no matter is allowed to transfer across the system boundaries (refer to Figure 1.2). On 
the contrary, open systems allow matter to be transferred across the system boundaries (refer to Figure 1.3).

1.1.2	
Energy
In its simplest definition, energy is the ability of a system to do work. In thermodynamics, the system may 
do work on the surroundings or the surroundings may do work on the system. The S.I. unit of energy 
is the Joule (J) and the unit for the rate of energy transfer (or power) is the Watt (W). In the case of a 
piston compressing a gas, the surroundings do work on the system (in this case the gas). On the other 
hand, when the gas expands, work is done by the system on the surroundings. During the compression 
and expansion processes, energy is converted from one form to another. In doing so, the total energy of 
the entire system remains unchanged. In other words, energy can neither be created not destroyed. This 
is a fundamental principle in physics which will be treated further in another section under the first law 
of thermodynamics. The science of thermodynamics is related to the understanding of how heat, work 
and other forms of energy within a system interact and change.
The definition of work is the scalar product of a force and a displacement vector at the point of application 
of the force. Work has the same units as energy (Joules). Using an elemental convention of work the 
following equation may be written:
	
бW = F . бx
(1.1)
Where F  is the force vector acting on the system and x  is the displacement vector. Integrating yields:
	
= ∫

W
Fdx 
(1.2)
where the integration is carried out between two points 
1x  and 
2x . The force and displacement vectors 
along a path are illustrated in Figure 1.4.

When the force acts over an area, a pressure results and the work expression of eqn. 1.2 can also be 
written in terms of a pressure (a negative sign is introduced to show that work is done by the system on

Heat energy is transferred between two bodies as a result of a temperature difference between the bodies. 
It is not the scope of this textbook to describe the heat transfer mechanisms of conduction, convection 
and radiation (refer to incropera et al. (2011) for a complete description). In thermodynamics, heat energy 
plays a fundamental role and there are many situations where heat is either rejected to the surroundings 
or is input into the system. In other situations, due to the system characteristics such as for instance the 
use of lagging material around the system, the heat energy transferred in or out of the system can be 
considered negligibly small. In such cases the system is said to be adiabatic.
In the case of open systems were fluid enters or leaves the system (known as the working fluid), kinetic 
and potential energies are also important. The kinetic energy per unit time is defined as:
	
˙Ek = 1

(1.6)
where g is the acceleration due to gravity and z is the height from some reference location.
1.1.3	
The energy convention
Throughout the rest of this book, the energy convention used is that energy output to the surroundings 
will be denoted as negative while energy input into the system will be denoted as positive. This is clearly 
depicted in Figure 1.5 It is important to note that this is used only to denote whether energy is being 
input or output. Energy is a scalar quantity which has only magnitude and does not change with different 
coordinate systems used.
1.2	
Properties of working fluids
The energy transfers in and out of a thermodynamic system are only possible by means of a working 
fluid. A simple definition is given in Eastop and McConkey (1993) as follows:
 
System

The transfer of energies across the system boundaries highly depends on the physical properties of 
the working fluid. Before considering thermodynamic processes, it is essential to understand the most 
important thermodynamic properties of the working fluid. When at least two thermodynamic properties 
(three thermodynamic properties in the case of a wet vapour which will be discussed later) are known, 
the state of the working fluid is said to be known since it is then straightforward to find any other 
unknown properties. The discussion on the property of entropy will be postponed to another section 
once the second law of thermodynamics is introduced.

Pressure
 
The units of pressure are either

N m  or the Pascal (Pa). Another commonly used unit in engineering 
is the bar where 1bar = 1 × 105 Pa. In fluids, pressure is defined at particular points. At first, this may 
seem to be counter-intuitive since pressure requires some sort of finite area. The more generic definition 
of pressure is therefore a limit where the area A  approaches zero:

where 
⋅
F n  is the normal force (pointing out of the element) and A  represents the area. The negative 
sign is due to the fact that the normal force is taken to act into the area while the normal vector n  is 
directed out of the area.
When referring to pressures in fluids a clear distinction is made between absolute and gauge pressure. 
The absolute pressure is the total pressure as defined in eqn. 1.8. The gauge pressure on the other hand 
refers to the pressure above (or below) the atmospheric pressure.
1.2.3	
Internal energy
The total energy of the atoms and molecules is divided into two primary components being their kinetic 
and potential energies. The symbol used for internal energy is U  and its S.I. units are the Joules. Taking 
the example of a gas, the kinetic energy would be the associated with the random motion of the molecules 
while the potential energy would be associated with the electrical static energy.

Reversibility and irreversibility
Thermodynamic states of systems can easily be represented by means of indicator diagrams where two 
fluid properties are plotted on an x  and y  axis. One of the most commonly used is the 
−
p V  (pressure-
volume) diagram.
In order to carry out its function, the system may perform a number of consecutive processes. A 
thermodynamic cycle is defined as follows:
Figure 1.6 shows an example of a thermodynamic process and a cycle on a 
−
p V  diagram.
Thermodynamic processes can either be reversible or irreversible.
In practice, reversible processes are ideal. In theory certain processes can be assumed to be reversible. This 
assumption is important particularly when establishing the behaviour of such systems. To illustrate further, 
consider the case of expanding a volume of gas. In the case of a controlled expansion such as that performed 
by a piston, the intermediate states between the start and finish of the expansion can easily be replicated upon 
compression if the compression conditions are exactly the same as the expansion (but in the opposite direction). 
Such a process can be assumed reversible. On the other hand, if the expansion of the gas is performed by 
means of an opening in the piston, the gas would expand freely to fill in the rest of the container. In such a 
case the intermediate states between the situation where the gas is contained within a small volume and the 
state where the gas occupies a larger volume is impossible to replicate in reverse. Such a process is highly 
irreversible. Reversibility is related to the property of entropy and will be explored in another section. The 
processes shown by dotted lines in Figure 1.6 are irreversible. For reversible processes, the lines should be 
sketched as full lines to show that the path can be replicated if the process where to be reversed.

The first law of thermodynamics
The principle of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. This 
is perhaps one of the (if not the) most important laws in physics. The same principle not only applies 
to energy but also to mass. These laws are the basis of many subjects in the physical sciences and are 
essential to the study of thermodynamics.
The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the principle of conservation of energy applied to 
thermodynamics systems.
Mathematically:

where C denotes that the sum is carried out over the entire thermodynamic cycle.

Non-flow processes
The first law of thermodynamics can also be extended to the case where there is no complete 
thermodynamic cycle. In a system where there is no flow in or out of the system boundaries (open 
system), the sum of elemental changes in work and heat energy will result in a change in the internal 
energy of the system. for this reason, the non-flow energy equation may be written as follows:
	
dW + dQ = dU

Steady flow processes
In the case where matter flows in and out of the system boundaries, the energies associated with that 
matter need to be included when equating the energy inputs and energy outputs. Figure 1.7 depicts all 
the energy inputs and energy outputs for the system. For the purpose of this chapter, only the steady 
flow case will be treated. This means that all time derivative terms are equal to zero.
From Figure 1.7, the energy inputs and outputs associated with the inlet and outlet are as follows:
1)	 pV associated with the work done to push an element of fluid into and out of the system to 
overcome the opposing pressure. 
2)	 The internal energy of the fluid U 
3)	 The kinetic energy of the fluid 1/2mc2 
4)	 The potential energy of the fluid mgz  
In addition, work and heat are input into the system.

The second law of thermodynamics
While the first law of thermodynamics describes the amount of energy which is input and/or output 
during a thermodynamic system in relation to its surroundings, the second law of thermodynamics 
describes the natural direction of energy. Heat energy flows from a high to a low temperature. For this 
to be reversed, work input must be performed by the surroundings on the system. A definition of the 
second law of thermodynamics can be as follows:
The second law of thermodynamics also hints towards the quality. In this context, quality refers to how 
easily energy can be converted. It is impossible to convert a certain amount of heat energy into work. 
On the other hand it is possible to convert a certain amount of work entirely into heat. The definition is 
graphically represented in Figure 1.8 where heat is extracted from a high temperature reservoir in order 
to produce work. Heat energy is shown to be transferred to the low temperature reservoir. The second 
law of thermodynamics states that

Heat engines
In Figure 1.8 reference was already made to the heat engine. Heat engines operate on thermodynamic 
cycles which satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. The high temperature source can be for instance 
obtained from the burning of fossil fuels. The heat engine which produces work could be composed of 
valves, pistons, heat exchangers and so on. The low temperature reservoir might be the atmosphere or 
for example a pond of water at a uniform temperature.
It is not the aim of this book to discuss further heat engine cycles but the reader is advised to read various 
thermodynamic text books such as Eastop and McConkey (1993) which give a comprehensive insight 
on various heat engines such as the Otto cycle and the Brayton cycle.

Fundamentals of refrigeration  
thermodynamics
HHea t engin es and reverse d he at engine
The efficiency of a heat engine has already been defined by eqn. 1.21 in chapter 1 and it was also 
emphasized that the second law of thermodynamics implies that η < 100%. It can also be proven that 
the best possible thermodynamic efficiency of a heat engine is that of an ideal cycle known as the 
Carnot cycle.
It is important at this stage to underline what is really meant by the word ideal in thermodynamic 
terms. The thermal models and analysis which will be presented in this textbook for various types of 
refrigeration systems will be considered ideal in order to simplify the analysis involved. The efficiencies 
of idealized cycles, apart from being limited from the results of the second law of thermodynamics, 
are also limited due to their differences from the Carnot cycle. In practice however, if such cycles are 
built and operated in a real environment, their efficiency will also be limited due to the irreversibility 
of the cycle. Çengel and Turner (2005) provide further detail on this topic and should be helpful to 
the interested reader.
A T-S diagram of the Carnot cycle for a heat engine is shown in Figure 2.1. The processes involved in a 
Carnot cycle require a heat supply at a constant temperature (1-2), an isentropic expansion (2-3), heat 
rejection at constant temperature (3-4) and an isentropic compression (4-1). All processes are represented 
by full lines and hence are reversible processes. In practice, such a system is particularly difficult to 
build due to the need for heat to be transferred at a constant temperature while maintaining the process 
reversible. This can be approximately satisfied if the heat transfer area is made as large as possible and 
the heat transfer is carried out very slowly. Both of these methods can be either prohibitively expensive 
or even impossible to carry out.

For engineering purposes, the Carnot cycle would seem at first to be of purely academic interest. It is 
nonetheless worthwhile to have a benchmark on which to base heat engine efficiency. Seen from this 
point of view, the Carnot cycle becomes a handy reference on which engineers may base design decisions 
or perform practical checks on their calculations. The efficiency of the Carnot cycle can be found from 
eqn. 1.22. The heat supplied and heat rejected can be found from the areas under processes 1-2 and 3-4 
respectively. Hence:

Eqn. 2.5 states that the efficiency of a Carnot cycle increases, as the difference between the high temperature

Reversed heat engines
We have already seen that heat energy has a natural tendency to flow from the hot to the cold body. A 
heat engine will enable the heat energy from a high temperature reservoir to be partially converted into 
useful work and in the process, rejecting heat to the low temperature reservoir.

HHea t engin es and reverse d he at engine
The reversed heat engine is shown in Figure 2.2 where it is shown that for heat energy Q1 to be transferred 
from the low temperature reservoir, work W needs to be supplied to the system. Heat energy Q2 is then 
rejected to the high temperature reservoir.
Whereas the quantity of interest in a heat engine is the work (which is considered to be a high grade 
form of energy since it can entirely be converted into heat), in the case of a reversed heat engine there 
are two quantities of interest. Depending on the application of the system the quantity of interest might 
be the heat extracted from the low temperature reservoir (to provide a cooling effect). On the other 
hand, the heat energy which is transferred to the high temperature reservoir (to provide heating) might 
be required. Although in a reversed heat engine cycle there are two quantities of particular interest, in 
most applications it is only one of these which is sought after. If heat needs to be extracted from the 
low temperature reservoir for refrigeration purposes the engine would be called a refrigerator. If heat 
needs to be supplied to a high temperature reservoir then the engine is known as a heat pump. The 
purpose of this book is refrigerator operation. Some consideration will also however be given to the 
heat pump since as described here a distinction between refrigerators and heat pumps is just based on 
the application required.

In principle, some net work might also be extracted from a reversed heat engine. Compared to the other 
quantities this is very small and in most situations no attempt is made to extract this minute amount of 
energy. The principle of operation of a reversed cycle is shown in Figure 2.3. Heat Q1 is transferred to 
the evaporator. The working fluid is then compressed to a high pressure and transferred to the condenser 
where heat energy Q2 is rejected. Work can be extracted from the turbine and the pressure drops back 
to the evaporator pressure.

(2.10)
This means that the COP of heat pumps is always higher than that of a refrigerator by a value of unity. 
This relationship is applicable in all cases since it is derived from the first law of thermodynamics. Also, 
COPhp is always more than 1.
2.3	
Carnot cycle for a reversed heat engine
As with the case of heat engines, a Carnot cycle for a reversed heat engine is the most efficient cycle 
possible. This means that the maximum possible COP for a reversed heat engine will always be less 
than this theoretical maximum, both for refrigerators as well as heat pumps. Again, such a system is 
not practical to build due to the reasons mentioned for the heat engine. However it may still be used as 
a benchmark or reference in the design of more practical systems.
The T-S diagram of the reversed Carnot cycle is shown in Figure 2.4. During process 1-2 the working 
fluid is compressed from a low to a high pressure and temperature. Heat is then rejected at a constant 
temperature in process 2-3. The pressure and temperature drops in process 3-4 where some work can 
be extracted. The fluid is then heated again at constant temperature during 4-1.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Vapours
Thermodynamic systems operate on working fluids which can either be in the liquid or gaseous state. 
Consider a liquid being heated at a constant pressure. Once the liquid reaches a certain temperature, 
boiling starts. This is usually observed as bubbles forming in the bulk of the liquid. This process 
continues until complete vaporization of the liquid occurs. It can be observed that for boiling to start, 
the pressure of the liquid must be increased with increasing specific volume. On the other hand, for 
complete vaporisation, the higher the specific volume, the lower the pressure required. The condition 
when boiling starts and full vaporization occurs can be drawn by means of a line on a p-v diagram. 
The start of boiling line is commonly known as the saturated liquid line. All along such a line the 
liquid just starts boiling. On the other hand, the line showing complete vaporization is known as 
the saturated vapour line. At higher pressures, these two lines intersect and form what is known as 
the critical point. At such a point, there is no real distinction between a liquid and a vapour. This is 
characterized by:

This holds true at a unique value of temperature which depends on the fluid. The saturated liquid and 
saturated vapour lines as well as the critical point are depicted in Figure 3.1.
To the left of the saturated liquid line, the fluid is a pure liquid. To the right of the saturated vapour line, 
the fluid is a known as a dry vapour and no liquid phase exists.
Consider another thought experiment where a liquid is heated by some means. The temperature rises 
at first. Once the saturated liquid line is reached, boiling starts. Heat continues to be supplied to the 
water but no increase in temperature will result. The heat energy is being used to change the phase of 
the liquid to a vapour. Once the saturated vapour line is reached, the temperature will again start to 
increase. The heat supplied during the change of phase where no temperature change occurs is known 
as the latent heat of vaporisation. With increasing pressure, the latent heat of vaporisation reduces. At 
the critical point it becomes zero.

Thermodynamic cycles can be sketched on various thermodynamic diagrams. The most commonly 
used in refrigeration are the T-s diagram and the p-h diagram. Figure 3.2 illustrates these diagrams and 
their important features. Such diagrams exist for different working fluids and properties can be read off 
directly from the chart.
The interpolation function of eqn. 3.2 can usually be obtained from the tables mentioned in the second 
method. If such a function is not available, interpolation between different values in a table may be 
performed. Table 3.1 shows an example of the format of a thermodynamic table of properties. Two 
quantities with subscripts 1 and 2 are shown for illustration purposes. Subscript f stands for a saturated 
liquid quantity, subscript g stands for a dry saturated vapour quantity. Moreover, a parameter with 
subscript fg is simply defined as ϕfg = ϕg – ϕf .
For a linear interpolation to find ϕi between two values ϕ1 and ϕ2 at pressure pi between p1 and p2 the

Working fluids in the superheat region
Consider a fluid which is just dry saturated. Further heating will cause the temperature of the fluid state 
to move to the right of the saturated vapour line of Figure 3.1. This region is known as the superheat 
region. Each point in the superheat region can be defined from the temperature and pressure of the fluid. 
With such quantities, the required thermodynamic properties can be established.
Further details on the interpretation of thermodynamic properties from tables can be found in specialised 
thermodynamic textbooks such as Eastop and McConkey (1993).

Specific heat capacity at constant volume
For a process carried out at constant volume, eqn. 1.37 applies:

heat energy per unit mass supplied per unit rise in temperature:

Specific heat capacity at constant pressure
For a process carried out at constant pressure, the first law can be written down in terms of enthalpy 
(refer to eqn. 1.35):
	
∆u = ∆Q − ∆W
	
∆u = ∆Q − p∆v
	
∆h = ∆Q
(3.10)
Where Q and W represent heat energy and work per unit mass. Similar to the constant volume 
case, the increase of specific enthalpy per unit rise in temperature is hence equal to the rise in heat 
energy per unit mass supplied per unit rise in temperature:

Choosing u = 0 at T = 0 as reference then C = 0.
Consider now a constant pressure process. Then from the first law of thermodynamics (refer to  
eqns. 1.35 and 3.9):
	
∆Q + ∆W = mcvδT
	
∆Q − p∆V = mcvδT
	
∆Q − mR∆T = mcvδT
	
∆Q = m∆T(R+cv )

For the constant pressure process it was already shown that ∆Q = mcp∆T (refer to eqn. 3.13). Hence,
	
mcp ∆T = m∆T(R + cv)

Thus

Fluids in refrigeration
The heat transfers required in refrigeration cycles are brought about by means of the conversion of heat 
into internal energy. The fluid by which this takes place is known as a refrigerant. When such changes 
in internal energy occur, the refrigerant may change phase from liquid to vapour.
3.3.1	
Desirable refrigerant properties
There are many properties of refrigerants which are sought after. Many of these requirements may indeed 
be conflicting and this creates some problems when coming to select an appropriate refrigerant for the 
cycle. Some of these requirements are listed next:
•	 Environmentally friendly
•	 Economically viable
•	 Safe (in terms of say toxicity and flammability)
•	 Compatibility
•	 Corrosiveness
•	 High latent heat of vaporization

Types of refrigerants
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) (see Badr et al. (1990)) are a type of halocarbons consisting of chlorine, 
fluorine and carbon. Examples include refrigerants such as R11 and R12. These are known to cause 
ozone depletion. When CFCs leak from systems, these diffuse upwards towards the atmosphere into 
the stratosphere. The molecules then breakdown and liberate Carbon as well as the halogens Chlorine 
and Fluorine as shown in Figure 3.3. In this case it is Chlorine which is responsible for ozone depletion.
Halons are on the other hand compounds containing bromine, fluorine and carbon. the consequences 
of molecular breakdown for these are even more problematic. As a partial solution to the problems with 
CFCs and halons, one or more of the halogens in the molecule can be replaced by a hydrogen atom.

A suitable replacement to CFCs are the HCFCs or hydrochlorofluorocarbons. These result in less 
environmental damage.
Inorganic compounds can also be used for refrigeration purposes Dincer and Kanoglu (2010). Examples 
include the following:
•	 Ammonia (R-717) (refer to Lorentzen (1988) for further information on this refrigerant)
•	 Carbon Dioxide (R-744)
•	 Water (R-718)
•	 Helium (R-704)
•	 Neon(R-720)
•	 Air(R-729)

Azeotropic refrigerants such as for example R-502 provide better COP. In the case of R-502 the mixture 
is composed of 48.8% R-22 and 51.2% R-115. A characteristic of azeotropic refrigerants is that the 
individual refrigerants making up the mixture cannot be separated by a distillation process.
Zeotropic mixtures provide various advantages including better refrigeration/heat pump performance as 
well as modifying the composition to suit various temperature needs. An example of a zeotropic mixture 
is R-407c which is composed of R-32, R-125 and R-134a.

The Montreal Protocol
On the 16th of September, 1987 the Montreal Protocol was signed by the European Economic Community 
(nowadays known as the European Union) and another 24 nations. Its aim was to limit the production 
of any substance which caused ozone depletion including CFCs and Halons (for more information on 
ozone depletion refer to Rowland (2006)). Its implementation was conducted from 1st of January 1989. 
The target was to limit down the production of such substances to 50% the levels of the year 1986. In 
the phase out management plan, the target is to halt production of HCFCs by 2013 and also reduce its 
consumption by 2015. A complete halt of HCFC use is required by 2030. An overview of some of the 
most important years for the Montreal protocol is shown in Table 3.3.

In order to set a measure on the effect of chemicals on the ozone layer, the Ozone Depletion Potential 
(ODP) is defined as follows:
Such a definition of the ODP does not consider the dynamics of the checmical process with time. A 
more accurate definition would hence include the ozone depletion over a particular time-span. The 
calculation of the ODP of a chemical can usually be found experimentally. Since it is a relative quantity 
(with respect to R-11), the experimental determination of the ODP can be quite accurate. Figure 3.4 
shows the time-dependent ODPs as obtained from Solomon and Albritton (1992).

Refrigerant names
Refrigerant designations and safety classifications are presented in the ASHRAE (2010)/ASHRAE 
Standard 34-2010. The need to label refrigerants with a shortened name is to avoid the lengthy chemical 
formula associated with many refrigerants. The system provides a concise way of referring to these 
refrigerants. The standard describes how to assign refrigerant numbers from right to left. Four digits 
are employed as follows:
When Bromine (Br) is present, then following the designation of the compound, the letter B must be 
included at the end followed by the number of Bromine atoms.
Two examples are shown here to demonstrate the system mentioned in this section.

Limitations of the Carnot cycle
While the Carnot cycle would be the most efficient cycle applied for the purpose of refrigeration/heat 
pumping, in practice there are a number of difficulties which hinder the application of such a cycle.  
A reconsideration of the Carnot cycle of Figure 2.4 enables the identification of these inherent problems. 
The cycle is shown again here in Figure 4.1 with the saturation lines included.

T

Figure 4.1: T-s diagram for a Carnot cycle with the 
saturation lines shown.
At state 1, the refrigerant is partly in the liquid phase and partly in the vapour phase. This wet vapour 
needs to be compressed to a higher pressure. In practice, a compressor can only compress a pure vapour. 
If a liquid is present at the inlet of the compressor, then the compressor components might be damaged 
due to the fact that a liquid is practically incompressible (this is valid only for positive displacement 
machines with very small clearances).
During the isentropic compression from 1 to 2, the refrigerant heats up and its pressure increases to the 
condenser pressure. Due to this, process 2 to 3 is not carried out at a constant temperature. This presents 
another deviation and as a result, the efficiency of the cycle would be expected to decrease.
From process 3 to 4, work can be extracted by the system. In practice, this work is rather small and 
cannot justify an investment for a turbine to extract this energy. Another way must therefore be found 
to lower the pressure of the refrigerant from the condenser pressure to the evaporator pressure.
All of these difficulties in building a practical Carnot cycle lead the engineer to find a better alternative, 
one which is both practical and which possibly has the highest COP. The modified Carnot cycle is known 
as the ideal vapour compression cycle.

Modifications to the Carnot cycle
4.2.1	
Compressor inlet
At exit from the evaporator, the refrigerant should either be dry saturated or superheated such that no 
liquid is present at the compressor inlet. This enables protection of the compressor which would be 
designed to operate on a vapour. In practice it is very difficult to control the state of the refrigerant such 
that it is just dry saturated at the compressor inlet. Hence at state 1, the refrigerant is usually a superheated 
vapour. The modified cycle is shown in Figure 4.2. Since the work input increases, the COP will decrease.

Condenser outlet
In the condenser, the refrigerant cools and gradually the quantity of liquid increases until the refrigerant 
is entirely in the liquid phase at state 3. The cooling of the liquid, causes state 3 shown in Figure 4.1 to 
move further to the left. This effect is positive for a refrigerator since the cooling process 4 to 1 produces 
a larger cooling effect (the area and hence heat energy absorbed by the refrigerant is increased). This 
prolonged cooling in the condenser is known as under-cooling. The downside of this is that it requires 
a larger condenser which may not be economical. The cycle is shown in Figure 4.3. The heat input in 
the evaporator increases and hence the COP will increase.

Replacement of the turbine
The expensive turbine can be replaced by a throttling valve. The thermodynamic characteristics of the 
throttling valve will be discussed in section 4.3. The throttling process is highly irreversible and will 
inevitably lead to an increase in entropy. This causes state point 4 to move to the right. As a result, the 
area under process 4 to 1 will reduce resulting in a lower cooling effect and hence a lower COP. The 
components of the cycle are shown in Figure 4.4 while the T-s diagram for the vapour compression 
cycle is shown in Figure 4.5.

The steady flow energy equation applied to the system components
The steady flow energy equation will be used to estimate the heat or work input/output from of each of 
the vapour compression system components. It will be shown that the thermodynamic property which 
determines the evaluation of these energies is the enthalpy (or specific enthalpy) at the various state 
points. These quantities can be obtained from the knowledge of the evaporator and condenser pressures 
(the low and high system pressures respectively) which can be used along with any one of the methods 
for finding the thermodynamic properties of fluids shown in section 3.1.

In a throttling process shown in Figure 4.10 there is neither work nor heat transfer across the system 
boundaries. Height changes will be considered again negligible. The throttling valve is essentially an 
obstacle to the flow resulting in high levels of turbulence generation and separated flow. If however the 
state points are considered far enough for the valve opening, the flow will again have uniform streamlines. 
Across these points, the velocity differences are also negligible. While the flow streamlines are restored 
some distance downstream, the entropy of the system increases and the process is highly irreversible. 
The resulting energy equation is as follows:

Multistage vapour compression cycles
4.4.1	
Flash chamber use in multistage vapour compression cycles
During the throttling process shown on the p-h diagram of Figure 4.6, as the refrigerant liquid passes 
through the throttle valve, a fraction suddenly flashes into a vapour (process 3-4). At entry to the 
evaporator, there is therefore a mixture of a liquid and a dry vapour. The dry vapour fraction cannot 
contribute to the cooling effect. For this reason, it would be ideal to divert the vapour component such 
that a pure liquid enters the evaporator in order to decrease the compressor work. This can be done by 
the use of a flash chamber operated at a pressure between the evaporator and the condenser pressures. 
The process is shown in Figure 4.11 and its p-h diagram in Figure 4.12. As can be seen, the process 
uses an additional throttle valve and in practice, the refrigerant entering the evaporator will not be a 
pure liquid.
It is also advantageous to make use of two small compressors rather than a large one. This improves 
the operating efficiency. State point 9 is the result of a mixing process of the vapours at state points 
2 and 3. The mixing process is assumed to be carried out adiabatically Another important note is 
that the mass of vapour per unit kg of refrigerant at 3 is x6 or simply the dryness fraction. The mass 
of vapour per unit mass of refrigerant through the evaporator is therefore 1 – x6. The enthalpy at 
state point 9 can be evaluated again using the steady flow energy equation. This can be done by 
ignoring kinetic and potential energy changes. These is no work done and for adiabatic mixing no 
heat transfer. Hence:

and cost requirements and efficiency. The larger the number of stages the better the efficiency but clearly 
the complexity and cost of the system will increase.

Vapour compression cycles
4.4.2	
Cascade vapour compression cycles
When requiring particularly low evaporator temperatures or high condenser temperatures, two or 
more vapour compression cycles can be operated in series as shown in Figure 4.15. In this manner 
the refrigerants of the individual cycles need not necessarily be the same. The evaporator of the top 
system acts as a cooler to the condenser of the lower system. The evaporator of the lower system is 
on the other hand responsible for the cooling effect. As with the case of a flash chamber multistage 
cycle, two compressors are used along with throttling valves for the individual systems. The cycle is 
shown in Figure 4.16 on a p-h diagram. The shaded regions show an increase in the refrigerating 
effect (area below process 4-1) as well as a decrease in the work input that is required by the two 
compressors. These two factors increase the COP of the cascaded refrigeration cycle as compared to 
the single stage cycle.

Refrigeration at various temperatures
In certain applications, the cooling effect of a system is required at various temperatures. A common 
example of such an application is the fridge-freezer. A single compressor is used along with two 
evaporators instead of one. This is shown in Figure 7.10. The cycle is also shown in Figure 4.14 using a 
p-h diagram. As can be noticed there are two different evaporator pressures (and hence temperatures). 
The refrigerant is throttled at various stages. In the definition of the COP for refrigeration, all evaporator 
energy transfers must be included. Hence:

Heat pumps
Heat pumps transfer heat from a low temperature reservoir to a high temperature reservoir (analogous 
to a pump which transfers a fluid from a low to a high pressure). Heat pumps are a very efficient method

Such systems however may require a substantial capital investment. The cold temperature source must 
be at a uniform temperature. The evaporator coils are therefore placed in the low temperature source 
and heat is transferred to the refrigerant flowing in the coils. Clearly for heat transfer to be present, 
the refrigerant temperature at the evaporator must be below the temperature of the source. Another 
important factor to consider in order to enhance the heat transfer is the icing problem. Ice formation 
on the surface of the coil causes an increase in the resistance to heat transfer thus reducing the system 
COP. The condenser coils would be located in the space which needs to be heated. Again for effective 
heat transfer, the refrigerant flowing through the condenser must have a slightly higher temperature 
than the space being heated.
4.5.1	
Heat pump performance
The COP as defined in eqn. 4.6 is the most commonly used measure of the performance of heat pumps. 
Heat pump COPs can range from around 2 to 4. The use of variable speed electric motors (for the 
compressor) can increase the energy efficiency substantially.
Heat pumps may use for instance renewable energy sources to power the compressor rather than 
electrical energy. For this reason, the COP is no longer truly indicative of the energy performance of the 
heat pump. A better way to assess heat pump performance would be to incorporate the primary energy 
input rather than the work done by the compressor. A better definition of the heat pump performance 
is therefore as follows:
where E is the primary energy supplied.

4.5.2	
Heat pump types and heat sources
Heat pumps can use natural sources of heat such as water, air or the ground. All of these contain a certain 
amount of heat but the usefulness of such heat energy is dependent on the temperature of these sources. 
The heat source must ideally be of a uniform temperature, easily accessible and should have thermophysical 
properties which are favourable for the cost effectiveness of the system. Air source heat pumps for instance, 
uses a widely available source but is prone to various issues such as frosting of the outdoor coils once the 
air temperature reaches temperatures approaching around 3°C This is usually resolved through a defrosting 
process which can ultimately reduce the operating efficiency of the heat pump. Another problem is that 
when space heating is mostly required in buildings, the outdoor temperature is usually low.
Water source heat pumps can be a good alternative since it provides a more uniform temperature than 
air. River or groundwater can for instance be used. Piping and pumping is generally required especially 
for groundwater heat pumps which may lead to additional costs. Moreover, the quality of the ground 
water can result in the reduction of heat exchange performance due to fouling. River or lake water can 
also be prone to freezing.
Geothermal heat pumps use pipes buried horizontally in the soil or boreholes drilled at vertical  
depths of around 100m to 200m. The latter types are generally used for large scale or industrial applications.
4.5.3	
Heat pump utilization
Since the heat energy which is extracted from air, water or the ground is free and renewable and since 
the heat energy supplied on the condenser side is higher than the energy input via the compressor heat 
pumps are considered as a green alternative to more wasteful processes such as gas heating. The energy 
savings by heat pumps installed from 2005-2011 and projected till 2020 is given in Table 4.1.

Compressors
4.6.1	
Compressor technologies
Compressors are designed to increase the pressure of a gas by means of a work input. In the case of 
refrigerators or heat pumps, the compressor operates on the refrigerant in order to increase the pressure 
from that of the evaporator to that of the condenser. There are various types of compressors. The choice 
depends particularly on the pressure ratio required as well as the flow rates of the gas. Rotary type 
compressors are used for high mass flow rates and low pressure ratios. Reciprocating type compressors 
are used for low mass flow rate and high pressure ratios (see Eastop and McConkey (1993)). In the 
rotary type compressors, the flow is steady whereas in the reciprocating type compressors, the flow is 
pulsating. Figure 4.17 shows a reciprocating type compressor. As the piston moves towards the left, the 
fluid inside the cylinder is compressed and exits through the delivery port. When the piston moves to 
the right, fluid enters the cylinder from the intake port. This motion is repeated at a particular frequency 
or speed of the reciprocating piston.
In the rotary type compressor shown in figure 4.18, an eccentric rotor having a number of vanes rotates in 
a cavity. The vanes seal off different segments. The gas is introduced in a segment and is compressed during 
the revolution of the rotor. Vane type compressors are quite common in domestic refrigerators, freezers 
and air-conditioners. Other rotary compressors include screw type compressors, scroll compressors and 
turbo compressors.(Dincer and Kanoglu (2010)).

Compressor efficiency
Volumetric efficiency
In reciprocating compressors, the swept volume by the piston is not necessarily the same as the volume of 
the cylinder. In practice there exists a clearance volume. This reduces the performance of the compressor.

Isentropic efficiency
A compression process is in practice irreversible. Hence the process is not really performed at a constant 
entropy. The entropy of the end state after compression is higher than the initial state, in line with 
the second law of thermodynamics. The vapour compression T-s diagram is shown again here with 
the compressor irreversibilities included. The dotted line shows the actual process undergone in the 
compressor. The bold line from 1 to 2s shows the compression process if the compressor compression

5.1	
Principles of vapour absorption
5.1.1	
Components of vapour absorption cycles
Vapour compression cycles require a compressor to do work on the refrigerant. Vapour absorption cycles 
replace this component with various other components in order to use heat energy rather than work as 
an energy input. The components unique to the vapour absorption cycle are the following:
•	 Absorber
•	 Pump(s)
•	 Generator (or Desorber)
The compressor is replaced by an absorber, pump and generator (and an optional heat exchanger) which 
is generally known as the solution heat exchanger (SHX). Another important difference from vapour 
compression cycles is that this system, apart from the refrigerant, makes use of an absorbent fluid.
Figure 5.1 depicts a vapour absorption cycle schematic. The absorber-generator part replaces the 
compressor. As can be noted in the figure, there are two additional heat transfers. In the absorber, the 
absorbent fluid absorbs within it the refrigerant vapour, with the consequence of a heat release.
The refrigerant-absorbent mixture is then supplied to the generator via a pump. In this unit, heat is 
transferred to the mixture in order to drive off the refrigerant from the mixture, leaving behind a weak 
solution (low percentage of refrigerant) which is transferred back to the absorber via a throttle valve. 
As the refrigerant-absorbent mixture is pumped to the generator some heat may be gained from the 
weak solution leaving the generator by means of using a solution heat exchanger. This greatly enhances 
the system performance.

Figure 5.1: Vapour absorption cycle diagram.
The pumps required in this system consume a minute amount of power compared to compressors. In 
vapour compression the energy input is of a high quality (shaft power), in vapour absorption on the 
other hand the energy input is in the form of heat from a source at a suitable temperature. It is therefore 
possible to use any source provided the temperature is high enough. These sources of heat maybe the 
burning of natural gas, waste heat from a particular process, solar energy or even geothermal energy.
5.1.2	
Refrigerants and absorbents in vapour absorption cycles
In an absorption system the working fluids used are a refrigerant and an absorbent. At particular points 
in the cycle we find a pure refrigerant while in others we find a solution involving a refrigerant and an 
absorbent. There are a number of properties required by such solutions. The most important of these 
are given here:
•	 No Crystallization – The cycle should operate between concentration limits which do not go 
beyond the crystallization line as otherwise a solid phase forms which would be problematic 
on the equipment operation.
•	 Volatility – The refrigerant should be much more volatile than the absorbent for easier 
separation in a generator.
•	 Affinity – The absorbent should have a strong affinity for the refrigerant under the conditions 
of absorption. The stronger this affinity the less the mass flow rate required for a given 
refrigerating effect.

Fundamentals of refrigeration

Vapour absorption and other cycles
•	 Pressures – The operating pressures should neither be too high (as this requires thicker wall 
structures) nor too low
•	 Chemical stability – High stability is needed to avoid formation of unwanted substances 
which may also lead to corrosiveness.
•	 Corrosiveness – Absorption fluids are corrosive and corrosion inhibitors are necessary.
•	 Safety – Certain standards are used to ensure safety under conditions of say toxicity 
flammability or even high pressure operation.
•	 Transport properties – Viscosity, surface tension, thermal and mass diffusivity are all 
important properties as these may affect heat transfer as well as pumping requirements.
•	 Latent Heat of vaporization – Again the refrigerant’s latent heat of vaporization should 
be as high as possible such that flow rates of both the refrigerant and the solution are 
minimized.
•	 Environmental concerns – Due to rising global warming concerns the use of certain 
refrigerants and absorbents may be prohibited (refer to ASHRAE (2009))
Most of these requirements are met by two particular pairs:
•	 Lithium Bromide as the absorbent and water as the refrigerant (LiBr – H2O)
•	 Water as the absorbent and ammonia as the refrigerant (H2O – NH3)

Enthalpy-concentration charts
For the analysis of absorption systems, information regarding the refrigerant-absorbent pair is necessary. 
This may be obtained by the use of enthalpy-concentration charts. In the case of LiBr – H2O pairs, the 
system operates at very low pressures and the LiBr remains in its liquid phase throughout the entire 
cycle. Hence, when heat is supplied in the generator, the resulting vapour is composed of 100 per cent 
refrigerant. One problem with LiBr is that it crystallizes at moderate to high concentrations, a condition 
which must be avoided at all costs if the equipment is not to fail. Figure 5.2 shows the fundamental 
features of a LiBr − H2O enthalpy-concentration chart.

Figure 5.2: Extracting information from enthalpy concentration chart.
Such a chart is based on the fundamental assumption that the solution is saturated at a given temperature 
and pressure. The fixed point (Cλ, hλ) may be established from the intersection of an isobar and an 
isothermal for a fixed temperature and pressure. The symbol C will be used to denote concentration of 
absrobent in the refrigerant. Hence, knowledge of the temperature and pressure in the absorber/generator 
would enable us to establish a value for the concentration of absorbent in the refrigerant-absorbent 
solution. Apart from this, we are also able to find the specific enthalpy of the mixture. The enthalpy 
concentration charts are shown in Figure A.10 in the Appendix section.

Thermodynamic analysis
Let the associated temperature and pressure for the generator be denoted by Tg and pg respectively. 
Similarly, for the absorber, the temperature and pressure will be denoted by Ta and pa respectively. On 
the other hand the condenser and evaporator quantities will be denoted by TE, pE, TC and pC respectively. 
Then, by considering the LiBr -H2O absorption cycle given in Figure 5.1, we can deduce the following 
by neglecting all pressure drops:
	
pg = pC
(5.1)
	
pa = pE
(5.2)
By knowing the temperatures in the absorber and generator it is hence possible to establish the 
concentration of LiBr and enthalpy of the solution at exit from the absorber (C4, h4) and the generator 
(C7, h7). From the pressures and temperatures we can also find the enthalpies at every state point for the 
part of the cycle where we have 100 percent refrigerant (states 0 to 3). Therefore, for the required heat 
transfer for cooling, Q1, the refrigerant mass flow rate is given by,

In many cases, in order to determine the cooling requirement of the absorber or the heating requirement 
of the generator, it is sufficient to perform an analysis on one of these sub-systems. The reason for this 
is that by knowing the cooling capacity and the condenser heat rejected the unknown energy quantity 
can be obtained by applying the first law of thermodynamics:

Dühring charts
An important chart for the analysis of vapour absorption systems is the equilibrium chart. A Dühring 
plot shows the cycle which the solution undergoes on the equilibrium chart. For the LiBr − H2O pair, 
the chart plots water saturation pressure (or corresponding saturation pressure) against the solution 
temperature. e concentration of  LiBr in solution is also represented on such a chart. ese are shown 
as constant concentration lines. With increasing solution temperature the liquid LiBr transforms into solid 
crystals. Figure 5.7 shows an example of Dühring plot for the cycle shown in Figure 5.8. e Dühring 
chart for LiBr−H2O solutions is shown in Figure A.9 in the Appendix section.

Ammonia – water absorption systems
The requirements of refrigerant-absorbent pairs include the need that the refrigerant must have a 
much higher volatility than the absorbent for easy separation in the generator. The absorbent in  
water-ammonia systems is the water which has a volatility which is quite close to that of ammonia. 
Moreover, a lower latent heat of vaporization as well as higher operating pressures make H2O – NH3 
systems more complicated than systems employing LiBr – H2O. Higher operating pressures also means 
that the system must be more robust, employing thicker shell sections.

Figure 5.8: LiBr-water vapour absorption system without SHX.
This can result in increased costs. Since the refrigerant in LiBr – H2O systems is water, evaporator 
temperatures cannot approach and operate the freezing point of water. The ammonia in H2O – NH3 
is the refrigerant and hence when evaporator temperatures below 0°C are required, such a system can 
provide an alternative to the use of LiBr – H2O which cannot be used near the freezing point of water.
A refrigerant heat exchanger (RHX) or sub-cooler maybe used to improve system performance. The 
advantages of under-cooling the refrigerant were already introduced. Heat is hence transferred from 
the refrigerant exiting the condenser to the stream exiting the evaporator. This increases the cycle COP 
at the expense of increasing the heat rejected in the absorber. The choice between counter flow, parallel 
flow or cross-flow heat exchangers is rather important for cycle performance optimization. Another 
addition to the cycle is the solution cooled rectifier (SCR) or simply the rectifier. This is used to avoid 
water transferring to the condenser during the desorption process in the generator. With the SCR, this 
water is hence transferred back to the generator whereas the ammonia is transferred to the condenser.

5.4	
Absorption chillers and heat pumps
Absorption heat pumps maybe employed in space heating applications while absorption chillers 
(refrigerators) maybe used in space cooling. The practical construction maybe quite different from 
that which maybe suggested in Figure 5.1. The construction of single stage heat pump systems is the 
same as in absorption chillers but the location of components would be different depending on which 
region requires the necessary heat transfer. It is most often convenient to engineer a system in such 
a way that the necessary cooling is obtained in a certain period of the year while heating is possible 
during the rest of the year. Figure 5.10 shows the heat pump or chiller system, this time using a 
diagrammatic representation with low and high pressure shells which contain the evaporator/absorber 
and the condenser/generator respectively.
5.5	
Heat transformers
Heat at a low temperature is most often considered as waste heat or low grade energy. Absorption 
systems may be used to increase (or boost) the temperature of a fluid. Such systems are known as heat 
transformers. Most heat transformers are single effect and use a LiBr – H2O solution.

Referring to figure 5.11, the temperature boosting which occurs is from an initial waste heat temperature 
Ti to a final temperature Tf. As can be seen, the variations from a single stage heat pump are indeed 
minimal. There are however three important differences:
•	 The positions of the evaporator/absorber shell and the condenser/generator shell are 
exchanged because in heat transformers it is the former shell which is at the highest pressure 
while the latter has the lowest pressure in the system.
•	 In the recuperative heat exchanger the heat is transferred to the strong H2O solution, i.e. the 
solution pumped from the generator to the absorber.
•	 The aim of a heat transformer is to obtain a temperature boost ∆T = Tf-Ti while in a heat 
pump/refrigerator, the primary aim is to increase the overall COP.

The COP of a heat transformer is defined in a slightly different manner than the COP of an absorption

The Dühring plot for the cycle is shown in figure 5.12. Again, apart from minor variation in the shape

in pressure levels of the evaporator/absorber and condenser/generator pair.

Multistage vapour absorption cycles
In general, when we talk about a multistage system we are referring to any absorption cycle where either 
the evaporator, absorber, generator or the condenser are present more than once in the system. For this 
reason, there may be various combinations and configurations of multistage systems giving different 
performances. Another term which needs due attention is multieffect. It signifies the number of times 
heat is utilized during an entire cycle. Multistaging can be obtained by one of the following ways:
•	 Sharing of the components between two or more systems. This enables an integration of two 
or more systems into one multistage system
•	 Having intrinsically separate systems and enabling an interaction of these systems via 
heat transfer
Multistage systems may also be thought of being composed of a number of elementary loops. The most 
fundamental loop would be the single effect absorption cycle. Thus, for each application of the absorption 
cycle to heat pumps, chillers or heat transformers various configurations may be chosen for a specific need 
such as higher COPs or say temperature boosting. In fact, multistage systems enable such increases in 
temperature and COPs when compared to the single effect systems. Of course, the more the elementary 
loops in the system the higher the cost. Indeed, economic analysis is hence essential.
A schematic diagram of a double effect absorption chiller is shown in Figure 5.13. In this case, 
heat energy is transferred directly to the high temperature generator by the burning of natural gas. 
However it is obvious that any other energy source maybe employed. The vapourised refrigerant from 
the high temperature generator is transferred to the low temperature generator where it condenses 
thus transferring heat to the solution in the generator. Some of the solution in the low temperature 
generator may actually flow to the high temperature generator. The rest of the cycle is the standard 
single effect loop.

Figure 5.13: Double effect, direct fired LiBr-water absorption chiller as adapted from Wang (2000)
On Figure 5.14 the Dühring plot enables us to visualize the cycle. There are in fact three pressure 
levels being only a few mmHg absolute in the absorber/evaporator, an intermediate pressure in the 
low temperature generator/condenser and a high pressure in the high temperature absorber. One 
can also observe four concentration values in the entire cycle. At state 1 the LiBr concentration is a 
minimum and hence the solution is dilute. Heat is transferred to the solution via the low temperature 
heat exchanger, raising its temperature. In the low temperature generator some heat is again transferred 
and some refrigerant boils off increasing the temperature of the solution and the percentage of LiBr. As 
can be noticed some of the solution from the high temperature generator is transferred to state 4 and 
mixed with the solution from the low temperature generator. The solution therefore becomes weaker 
in refrigerant as the percentage of LiBr increases further. In the recuperator, heat is transferred from 
the solution to the strong refrigerant solution hence reducing its temperature to that at state 5. At state 
6 on the other hand we have the same concentration as state 3, but now the stream has been heated 
by means of the high temperature heat exchanger. Heating of the solution at the high temperature 
generator causes more refrigerant to be boiled off than in the low temperature generator. Hence, at 
state 7 we have the highest LiBr concentration. This is then cooled in the same high temperature heat 
exchanger to state 8.

Fundamentals of refrigeration  
thermodynamics
Vapour absorption and other cycles
Due to the high pressures involved in H2O – NH3 systems, it would be impractical to think of multi-effect 
systems based on various pressure levels. The pressures would in fact be very high and much more robust 
equipment would be required which maybe both expensive as well as cumbersome. However, multi-effect 
H2O – NH3 systems do exist, but are based on concentration staging. The performance of water-ammonia 
cycles is improved by the use of a generator-absorber heat exchanger. Cycles employing such a concept 
are therefore more commonly known as GAX cycles. A single effect GAX cycle would give the same 
performance as a single effect LiBr – H2O cycle. GAX technology is not possible with LiBr – H2O cycles 
due to crystallization of the lithium bromide. These systems provide a very good COP in heating mode. 
The reader is referred to Kang et al. (2000), Jawahar and Saravanan (2010) and Mehr et al. (2013) for a 
detailed review on advanced vapour absorption cycles.

Gas liquefaction
Gases may be liquefied by cooling them (at atmospheric pressure) below a certain critical 
temperature which depends on the gas. Above the critical temperature, the fluid is in a gaseous 
state. Below the critical temperature a liquid starts forming. Refrigeration for the purpose of 
gas liquefaction is very important in the area of cryogenics which is a broad field encompassing 
low temperature systems (generally below 173K). Gases which are commonly liquefied are Air, 
Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon.
The Linde-Hampson cycle is particularly common in gas liquefaction. The process schematic is shown in 
5.15. Makeup gas is introduced at state 1 where it is mixed with the gas exiting the heat exchanger. The 
mixture is compressed to a high pressure at constant temperature at state 2. It is then cooled by means 
of the heat exchanger to state 3 where it is throttled irreversibly to state 4 where a mixture of gas and 
liquid is present. The liquid is removed at state 5 while the remaining gas is fed to the heat exchanger 
where it is heated to state 1 where it is mixed with more makeup gas.

Steam jet refrigeration
Using water as a refrigerant, steam jet refrigeration can provide the necessary cooling needs at 
temperatures above approximately 5°C. Such systems find common use in air-conditioning since the 
temperatures usually required are not too low and also because water is perfectly safe if leakages occur.

With reference to Figure 5.17, high pressure steam is supplied at state 1 where it mixes with the steam 
from state 6. A jet ejecter is used where the mixture is accelerated at first with a consequential reduction 
in pressure but is then expanded in the diffuser section where it gradually attains a high pressure and is 
fed to the condenser. The condensate is pumped out of the system and into the boiler from where steam 
may be obtained and introduced back into the system at state 1. At state 6, vapour from the flash cooler 
is continuously drawn up to the jet ejector. The rest of the water is at the desired temperature and is 
transferred for cooling purposes. Make up water is continuously introduced into the system.
5.9	
Air standard refrigeration cycle
Air can act as a suitable refrigerant. In such a case, a reversed Brayton cycle can be used. The cycle and 
the corresponding T-s diagram are shown in Figures 5.18 and 5.19 respectively.
The only difference from the standard vapour compression cycle is that the throttle valve is replaced by 
a turbine.

General idea
Modelling thermodynamic systems can be performed on a sub-component level (such as valves, heat 
exchangers etc.). This type of modelling generally requires the use of thermo-fluid analysis. This can 
be done through the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Such an approach is generally rather 
time-consuming and is in most cases adopted at a later stage in the design process. Another approach 
is to globally model the entire thermodynamic system. Each sub-component can be described by a set 
of equations based on mass and energy balance equations. Sub-components may either have a single 
input and output or even multiple inputs and outputs.
When combining all equations from every sub-component, it is not possible to find a solution to the 
problem. The operating conditions of the system must be input. This generally include pressure levels, 
saturation temperatures or for the refrigeration cases, cooling capacity. With the inputs provided by the 
user, the resulting system of equations should be solved using one of various numerical methods which 
are available to the engineer (see Faires and Burden (2012) and Isaacson and Keller (1994)).

The resulting system of equations can either be linear or non-linear depending on the unknowns of the 
system. Linear systems of equations are rather easy to solve and do not require substantial computational 
time. When dealing with relatively complex non-linear systems, the problem becomes more time-
consuming. Today’s computational technology however generally still permits that such systems may 
be solved within acceptable time frames.

to remain the same at entry and exit of the connection. A representation is shown in Figure 6.1. The

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Fundamentals of refrigeration

Principles of numerical modelling and experimentation
Such a system may have:
•	 A unique solution
•	 No solution
•	 Infinitely many solutions
The solution of linear systems is dependent on the number of equations n and the number of unknowns 
m. The following three definitions give the classification of such the system. In the modelling of 
thermodynamic systems we seek a determined solution where the number of equations is equal to the 
number of unknowns.
A single stage vapour compression cycle, as will be shown in this chapter, can me modelled as a 
determined linear system of equations given the certain inputs from the user. A computer code can be 
used to solve such a system. Mathworks’ Matlab(®) program will be introduced. Solving a linear system 
is rather straight forward and an example will be shown next for demonstration purposes.

A numerical procedure which can be applied to solve non-linear systems of equations is the Newton’s 
method. Suppose we have n functions f1(x), f1(x) ... , fn(x). The set of functions must be re-arranged such that:

Experimentation and uncertainty
In thermodynamics and refrigeration, experimentation is carried out by means of various forms of 
measurement including flow, temperature, volumetric, mass, electrical and power measurement. e 
measurement of these fundamental quantities can then be used to calculate derived quantities. ere are 
various text books which explain the various measurement devices and techniques that are mentioned 
here. e reader is referred to Miller (1996), Holman (2001), Benedict (1984) and Granger (1994).

Fundamentals of refrigeration

Principles of numerical modelling and experimentation
Experimental test rigs include the system under investigation as well as all the necessary instrumentation. 
While it is possible to perform measurements by means of analogue devices, in modern experimentation 
the data is collected in digital form and logged by means of a multi-channel data-logger. e data can 
be effectively stored on a local drive and then analysed at a later stage. The reader is referred to Morris 
(2001) for more details of modern data gathering techniques. Before any measurement can take place, 
the measurement devices need to be calibrated. The output of a particular sensor is a voltage signal which 
must then be converted, by means of a calibration function to the value of the quantity in question. 
In principle, the calibration procedure should be carried out every time that there is a substantial time 
difference between one measurement and another. This is because environmental variables might cause 
the calibration procedure of a previous time to be invalid.
All experimental measurements contain a certain level of uncertainty. Dieck (2006) gives a detailed 
overview of the fundamentals related to uncertainty. In a way, uncertainty is considered to be a quantity 
representing how much the data disperses around the actual quantity that should be measured. It is a 
probabilistic quantity which depends on a number of factors which are not only associated with the 
measurement equipment but also with the environment (which here includes the operator) in which the 
test is carried out. The error of a particular reading from its true value can be divided into systematic 
and random error.
No matter how many times one repeats an experiment, the same offset will reappear in the following 
measurements. These kinds of errors are hence estimated by means of different types of measurements 
or calculations.
The standard uncertainty can be estimated using the standard deviation of a set of readings.  If the standard 
deviation of the mean is denoted by s, then the standard uncertainty for N samples in the set is given by:

Limitations of numerical methods and experimental validation
Caution must be exercised in interpreting these results. The energy balances are based on the fundamental 
assumption that there are no energy losses from the system. In reality such energy losses do exist and 
certain processes are not really reversible as is assumed in the equations governing the system. Numerical 
results must always be validated through experiments. The models are in most cases tuned such that 
better agreement is obtained between what is calculated and what is actually measured.

The state points and system components are shown in Figure 7.1 for the reader’s reference. In this case, 
the exit temperature from the evaporator is taken as being the saturation temperature corresponding 
to the evaporator pressure. This can however be changed such that the refrigerant is superheated at exit 
from the evaporator. The refrigerant used in this analysis will be R134a.
The code listing for the calculation of the thermodynamic quantities at all state points is shown next. 
The algorithm first establishes the necessary thermodynamic properties at various state points. This is 
done by means of the refrigerant (R134a) table of thermodynamic properties. These are then used to 
calculate the energy inputs and outputs which are then used to find the COP.

Effect of pressure on refrigeration COP
The variation of refrigeration COP with evaporator and condenser pressures is shown in Figures 7.2 and 
7.3. As can be noted, the COP increases with increasing evaporator pressure and decreasing condenser 
pressure. The variation of COP with evaporator pressure is rather linear. This is not the case for the 
variation of COP with condenser pressure.

The variation of the rate of cooling with evaporator and condenser pressures is shown in Figures. 7.4 and 
7.5. The corresponding compressor power input is shown in Figures 7.6 and 7.7. There is a high sensitivity 
of the power input to the evaporator pressure. For a range of less than 1.5bar in evaporator pressure, the 
compressor power input variation corresponds to round about a condenser pressure variation of 6bar.

Effect of undercooling and super heating on refrigeration COP
Figure 7.8 shows the variation of COP with condenser undercooling. The variation is relatively linear. 
The dif ference in COP between 0K and 14K of undercooling is 0.5. The superheat temperature used at 
the evaporator exit does not seem to affect this result substantially but a higher COP can be observed 
for a superheat temperature of 20K. The reason for this is the increased cooling effect in the evaporator 
(larger area under process 4-1).

for system design. Figure 7.10 shows the system and state points that are modelled in this section. The

Fundamentals of refrigeration  
thermodynamics
Vapour compression system modelling
The procedure adopted in this model is similar to that used for the single stage system. The same equations 
are used for the lower part of the system. Given the inputs, and hence not knowing the temperature at 
the output of the intermediate pressure evaporator, the problem becomes one which requires multiple 
numerical iterations since both state 5 and state 8 are unknowns. In the first iteration, state 8 is assumed 
to be in the liquid state (on the saturated liquid line). This enables the calculation of the enthalpy at 
state 5 since:
	
⋅
= −
+

(7.1)
where Q2 is the heat output from the intermediate pressure condenser (thus being negative). The rest of 
the calculation is the same as for the single stage vapour compression cycle. A new value of the enthalpy 
at state point 8 may hence be established and the enthalpy at state point 5 may be re-calculated in the 
next iteration. The process is repeated until an acceptable convergence is attained in the value of the 
enthalpy at state point 5.

The algorithm is given here:
1.	 Solve the lower part of the system with the algorithm proposed in the previous section
2.	 Assume an initial enthalpy value at state point 8 (the first iterate can be taken as the 
enthalpy for a pure liquid at the intermediate pressure)
3.	 Find the enthalpy at state point 5 from eqn. 7.1.
4.	 Solve the rest of the system using the same algorithm proposed in the previous section
5.	 Calculate a new value for h8 and calculate a new value for h5
6.	 If the difference between the old and the new value of h5 is below a certain tolerance, then 
convergence has been obtained. If not then repeat steps 3 to 5 using the new iterate of h8
7.	 All required energy quantities are established from the enthalpies at the state-points
7.2.2	
Mass flow rate ratio and refrigeration performance
It is useful to understand how the performance of the cascaded system is affected by the mass flow 
rate in the various system stages. The system pressures are set to an evaporator pressure of 1.33 bar, an 
intermediate pressure of 6 bar and a condenser pressure of 10 bar. The result of refrigerating COP against 
mass flow rate ratio (defined as mL / mH) is given in Figure 7.11. As can be observed, a monotonically 
increasing function is obtained. The COP is little affected when mL/ mH < 0.85. When the mass flow rate 
on the lower stage is increased above the higher stage mL/ mH > 1, the COP starts to increase relatively 
rapidly for these operating pressures. The behaviour may suggest that the COP will continue to increase 
indefinitely by increasing the mass flow rate ratio. This is not the case since the refrigerant condition 
at entry to the high pressure side compressor (must be dry saturated or superheated) dictates a certain 
limit on this mass flow rate ratio which can be used.

7.2.3	
Effect of undercooling on performance
For the single stage vapour compression cycle, the undercooling of the refrigerant at the condenser exit 
provided an increase in refrigeration COP. For a cascaded system, the undercooling in the lower part 
of the system is expected to yield the same trend. Undercooling at the high pressure condenser exit 
will cause state point 8 to shift to the left of the p-h diagram. For a particular heat transfer from the 
intermediate pressure condenser, this shift will cause state point 5 to also shift to the left. This may cause 
the refrigerant to still be wet at the inlet to the compressor thus causing damage. The second negative 
effect is that this will cause the high pressure compressor to require more energy input. The effects of 
undercooling in the intermediate pressure condenser (undercooling1) and high pressure condenser 
(undercooling2) on the high pressure compressor power input is illustrated in Figures 7.12 and 7.13. As 
can be observed, the compressor energy requirements by undercooling the refrigerant at the intermediate 
pressure condenser exit are reduced. The opposite maybe observed with the high pressure condenser 
undercooling. In both cases the mass flowrates are set to 1kg/s and 0.8kg/s for the lower part and the 
upper part of the cycle respectively. The refrigeration COPs are given in Figures 7.14 and 7.15. It is clear 
that to maximize refrigeration COP no undercooling in the high pressure condenser should be present.

Effect of intermediate pressure on performance
The choice of intermediate pressure between the high pressure condenser and the low pressure evaporator 
will be investigated next. Figure  7.16 shows the variation of refrigeration COP with intermediate pressure. 
The variation is practically linear over the chosen range of pressures. Over a pressure change from 4bar 
to 8bar the COP difference is less than 0.1. This shows that the COP is not really sensitive to variations 
in the choice of intermediate pressure.

LiBr-water vapour absorption system
8.1.1	
Algorithm
To demonstrate further the utility of numerical modelling applied to refrigeration, the vapour absorption 
system (using a LiBr-water combination) is modelled in this chapter. The modelled system is represented 
in Fig. 8.1.
The following fundamental inputs are used. Some of these variables are varied in order to analyse the 
effects of these on certain output quantities as was done in chapter 7. The cooling capacity Q1 is used 
as a system input.

The thermodynamic properties at each state point needs to be established first. The quantities for water 
are established from available thermodynamic data by means of a separate function. The properties of the 
LiBr-water mixture are obtained from an interpolating polynomial as described in ASHRAE (2009). The 
polynomial is used to evaluate the enthalpy of the mixture at various state-points given the concentration 
of LiBr in water. This is given hereunder:

The code is shown next. The function steam finds the thermodynamic properties for steam given the 
inputs provided for the function. On the other hand, the function LiBr_water finds the enthalpy of the 
LiBr-water mixture at the inputs of concentration and temperature provided by the user.
The system of equations that needs to be solved is linear and is made up of mass and energy conservation 
equations as described in chapter 6. An inverse matrix approach is used to solve the system such that no 
numerical iterations are necessary. This is performed by means of the inv() function in Matlab.

8.1.2	
Solution concentration
The concentration of LiBr in water at state points 4, 5, 6 and 7 will affect the performance of the vapour 
absorption system. This is due to the fact that such concentrations will determine the flow rates present 
in these state points and hence also the energy input in the generator and the energy rejected in the 
absorber.
At exit from the absorber, the solution will be weak since the percentage of LiBr is smaller than at exit 
from the generator. Due to the desorption of the water from the LiBr, the stream at exit from the generator 
is strongly concentrated with LiBr.
Fig. 8.2 show the refrigeration COP variation with the weak concentration at various strong concentrations. 
On the other hand Fig. 8.3 shows the COP variation against the strong solution concentration at various 
weak solution concentrations. It is clear that as the concentration of the weak solution is increased, there 
is a reduction in the system COP. Also, as the concentration of the strong solution is reduced the same 
problem happens. When the weak solution is at a concentration of 55% the system performance degrades 
dramatically when Cstrong reduces to 56%. The reason for this behaviour is that in the limit as the weak 
solution concentration approaches that of the strong solution, it means that there is little desorption 
taking place in the generator and the energy required in the generator is practically equal to the exit 
enthalpy of the water at state 1.

Absorber and generator temperature effects
Fig. 8.4 shows the generator heat input (on the primary axis) as well as the absorber heat rejected (on 
the secondary axis) as a function of absorber temperatures. The results are shown for various generator 
temperatures. The generator heat input reduces with increasing absorber temperature. The absorber 
cooling requirements also decrease. At a lower generator temperature, the heat input requirements to 
the generator is also reduced compared to a high temperature used in the generator. This means that for 
this system, if the difference between the generator and absorber temperatures is reduced, the generator 
heat input requirements reduce and hence the COP becomes higher.
e cooling requirements in the absorber also decrease with decreasing generator temperature. It is 
interesting to understand whether this effect persists when a solution heat exchanger is used. is will be 
answered in the next section of this chapter. e results for COP reflecting what has been said regarding 
the generator heat input are shown in Figs. 8.5 and 8.6.

Effect of pressures on COP
The effect of evaporator and condenser pressures on the COP is shown in Fig. 8.7. It is clear that the 
sensitivity of the COP with evaporator and condenser pressures is relatively small. This goes to show that 
the performance of the unit is more dependent on the conditions found on the generator side.

LiBr-water vapour absorption system using a solution heat exchanger
8.2.1	
Algorithm
In this section, the solution heat exchanger is introduced. This sub-component has four inputs/outputs. 
The formulation of the system of equations results in 13 unknowns and 13 equations. The system is 
however non-linear. In this example, the in-built equation and system solver solve() in Matlab will be 
used. All inputs are maintained the same as for the no solution heat exchanger case in order to facilitate 
comparisons between the two systems. For the heat exchanger, an effectiveness of 0.775 is used. Also, 
in the heat exchanger equation used, the minimum heat capacity of the hot and cold stream is required. 
Kaita (2001) gives a comprehensive study of various thermodynamic properties of LiBr-water mixtures. 
At the temperatures and concentrations being considered, an average value of Cmin = 1.9 is considered 
suitable. This is maintained constant throughout. Kaita (2001) showed that even for relatively high 
variations in temperatures and concentrations the value only varies by around 10%. Part of the program 
listing is shown here.

8.2.2	
Solution concentration with SHX
The effect of changing the solution concentration is somewhat similar to the case when no solution heat 
exchanger is used. Both the weak and strong solution concentrations will impact the system COP. The 
difference that can be noticed from the case where no heat exchanger is used is in the sensitivity of the 
COP to the solutions concentrations. Fig. 8.8 shows the variation of refrigeration COP with the weak 
solution concentration. At low concentration the COP remains rather constant and the strong solution 
concentration does not impact the COP. At higher weak solution concentrations, the COP reduces only 
by around 0.1 for high strong solution concentrations but reduces dramatically when the stron solution 
concentrations are low. When comparted to Fig. 8.2, it can be seen that the solution heat exchanger 
reduces the sensitivity of COP to solution concentrations. The heat transferred from the strong solution 
side compensates slightly for negative effect of having a relatively small strong solution concentrations 
or too high a weak solution concentration. Fig. 8.9 plots COP against the strong solution concentration 
in order to help the reader visualize better the effect of the strong solution concentration variation 
on the COP. The results from the simulation show the importance of having as low a weak solution 
concentration as possible.

Absorber and generator temperature effects with SHX
Fig. 8.10 is similar to Fig. 8.4 and shows the generator heat input and the absorber heat rejected 
against absorber temperatures for various generator temperatures. The introduction of the solution heat 
exchanger enables a reduction in the generator heat input (hence the increase in COP) but also reduces 
the cooling requirements in the absorber. Figs. 8.11 and 8.12 show the variation of COP with absorber 
and generator temperatures respectively. When no solution heat exchanger is used, it was found that 
the COP increases by increasing the absorber temperature and reducing the generator temperature. The 
same behaviour can be observed when a solution heat exchanger is used. The COP is in all cases higher 
than for a system with no solution heat exchanger.

Effect of pressures on COP when using a SHX
The effect of evaporator and condenser pressures on the COP when a solution heat exchanger is used is 
shown in Fig. 8.13. As was the case for a system with no solution heat exchanger, the COP is not that 
much affected by the evaporator and condenser pressures. Again the COP for this case is higher than 
the original system with no solution heat exchanger.
