Sanitation and Water Supply in Low-income Countries

Preface
Preface
Water supply and sanitation are amongst the most basic requirements of life. For the past 50 to 150 years people living 
in Europe, America and a few capital cities elsewhere around the globe have come to take for granted the provision of a 
virtually limitless supply of clean, safe water and the seemingly effortless removal of all human wastes ‘out of sight and 
out of mind’. That this miracle of collective political will, urban planning and engineering bravura is so much taken for 
granted is credit to the public health engineers, planners, civic administrators and politicians who made it possible. That 
we should take it for granted is wholly unacceptable.
The reason is that for hundreds of millions of people, the struggle for water is an all too real, daily reality, and there are 
still over 1 billion people defecating daily in the bush, alongside the railway tracks or in the lanes behind their houses. 
Sanitation and water supply remain distant dreams for millions of people all over the world. Precisely because so much 
has been achieved, much has been lost. Sanitation and water supply are rarely seen as political ‘winners’ anymore. Too 
much effort is expended on the wrong solutions – much has been learned but much has been forgotten. This book is about 
basic engineering common sense. It is about understanding the real nature of the public health crisis that confronts us. 
Recent research confirms the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria; many of them the same pathogens 
that transmit disease from infected people to healthy people by means of their feaces, including those responsible for 
cholera and dysentery. In countries where these diseases are endemic this raises the spectre of a widespread public health 
disaster with no cure. It is inevitable that the medical research community and many of their donors will call for more 
money for research; inevitable too that the focus will be on yet more medical interventions that can help fight off this new 
killer. Yet we already have the solution to hand. More than 150 years ago, John Snow successfully proved that the surest 
way of preventing deaths from faeco-oral diseases (that is diseases that are passed on from one sick host to the next victim 
via the victim’s faeces) is to stop those faeces from getting in to the water supply in the first place (see Box 2.2). And we 
already have the technologies to do it too – simple toilets, well-managed septage systems, e-Thekwini latrines, simplified 
sewerage, simple water supply technology and, best of all, handwashing with soap – all these have been demonstrated to 
safely protect people from faeco-oral diseases time and time again. 
So this book is also all about saving lives, right here and right now. The United Nations only declared sanitation and 
water as human rights last year, but it seems astonishing that they needed to do so at all. Surely the right to live without 
daily exposure to human faeces has been recognised long ago in wider recognition of human rights to dignity and health. 
The aim of this book is to both inspire and instruct – to show how easy it is to save lives and yet what an immense and 
important challenge it still remains.

1	 Introduction to the Global 
Sanitation and Water-Supply Crisis
1.1	
The Magnitude of the Crisis
The World Health Organization and UNICEF reported that in 2008, when the world population was just over 6,750 million, 
there were around 2,600 million people in the world, almost all of whom were in developing countries, who did not have 
access to an ‘improved’ sanitation facility, and some 884 million people, again almost all in developing countries, without 
access to an ‘improved’ water supply (see Table 1.1 for the definitions of ‘improved’ sanitation and water supplies).[1] Of 
those without access to improved sanitation, some 1,100 million had no sanitation facilities at all and so had to defecate 
in the open – these are the so-called ‘open defecators’. Most of the people without access to improved sanitation and water 
supplies are poor − Figures 1.1 and 1.2 illustrate this for sanitation in India.[2]
Table 1.1: WHO/UNICEF definitions of ‘improved’ sanitation and ‘improved’ water supplies 
(details of sanitation and water supply technologies are given in Chapters 3 and 4).

Developing countries and the international community (United Nations agencies, multilateral and bilateral aid agencies 
and development banks, and charitable organizations) have been working since 1980 to achieve ‘Sanitation and Water 
and for All’. First there was the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade (1981−1990); then Safe Water 
2000 (1991−2000), which despite its title included sanitation; and now there are the water and sanitation targets of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are to reduce by half the proportion of people without access to improved 
sanitation and water supplies, taking 1990 as the base year, by the end of 2015.[3] These MDG targets may well help focus 
developing-country governments and the international community on the sanitation and water supply crisis, but, even if 
they are achieved (which now seems unlikely, especially for sanitation), they do not address the whole problem as there 
will still be many hundreds of millions of people without access to improved sanitation and water supplies in 2015 and 
beyond. The only really meaningful target is universal coverage – i.e., Sanitation and Water for All.
These figures for the number of people without access to improved sanitation and water supplies, while extremely alarming, 
may actually be gross underestimates as the definitions used for ‘improved’ sanitation and water supplies are based solely 
on access to sanitation and water-supply technologies. The definitions tell us nothing about how well the systems are 
working (or if they are working at all), whether they are affordable, or how much time people spend collecting water. As

They do not necessarily represent acceptable levels of service” [emphasis added].[4]

IIntroductio n to the  Global  ..
The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) has done some ground-breaking research on what it 
terms ‘adequate’ sanitation and water supplies. The definitions used by UN-Habitat are:[5]
--
Adequate sanitation: “access to sanitation that is convenient for all household members, affordable, and that 
eliminates contact with human excreta and other wastewater in the home and neighbourhood”, and
--
Adequate water supply: “a supply of water that is safe, sufficient, regular, convenient, and available at an 
affordable price”. 
In five towns in western Kenya in 2006 access to ‘improved’ water supplies appeared to be quite good (52−76%) but when 
households were excluded because they had less than 20 litres of water per person per day (lpd), they spent more than 
10% of household income on water, and they spent more than 60 minutes per day collecting water, access to ‘adequate’ 
water supplies fell dramatically to 2−21% (Figure 1.3).[6] Thus ‘improved’ is a long way from ‘adequate’ − and you could 
argue that people should have ≥30 lpd, not ≥20; that they should spend ≤5% of their income on water, not ≤10%; and 
that they should spend ≤30 minutes a day collecting water, not ≤60 – in which case access to an ‘adequate’ water supply 
would be even lower than shown in the figure.
Figure 1.3: Percentage of the populations in five towns in western Kenya with access to an ‘improved’ water supply (black) and with access to 
an ‘adequate’ water supply (red), with ‘improved’ defined as in Table 1.1 and ‘adequate’ defined as ≥20 litres of water per person per day, ≤10% of 
household income spent on water, and ≤1 hour spent per day collecting water.
As might be expected, most of the countries that are not on-track to meet the MDG sanitation target are in Sub-Saharan 
Africa and Asia (Figure 1.4), and almost all of those not on-track to meet the MDG water- supply target are in Sub-Saharan 
Africa (Figure 1.5). As noted in a recent WaterAid report, if the current rate of progress is not increased, then Africa will 
meet the sanitation target not by the end of 2015, but only by the end of 2084.[7]

Disease, Stunting and Cognitive Impairment 
Poor sanitation and poor water supplies cause disease and death. In 2000 poor hygiene, poor sanitation and poor water 
supplies, taken together, caused 4% of all deaths in the world and were responsible for 5.7% of the total global burden of 
disease.[8] Malnutrition is the only greater risk factor.
1.2.1	
Infant and child mortality and life expectancy at birth
Infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of babies who die before their first birthday, expressed per 1000 live births 
(‰), and child mortality rate (U5MR) is number of children who die before their fifth birthday, again expressed per 
1000 live births. In industrialized countries in 2008 the IMR was 5‰ and the U5MR 6‰. The corresponding figures for 
developing countries were 49‰ and 72‰, respectively; and for the least developed countries1 82‰ and 129‰.[9] In 2006 
four countries had U5MRs ≥200‰ (i.e., ≥20 percent of children did not make their fifth birthday): Afghanistan (257‰), 
Angola (220‰), Chad (209‰) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (200‰).

Life expectancy at birth (LEB) is the number of years newborn children would live if subject to the mortality risks 
prevailing for the cross section of population at the time of their birth. LEB in 2008 in industrialized countries was 80 
years, in developing countries 67 years, and in the least developed countries 57 years. The five countries with the lowest 
LEBs in 2008 were Zimbabwe (44 years), Zambia and Lesotho (45 years), and Mali and Nigeria (48 years) [these low LEBs 
are mainly due to the large number of AIDS-related deaths in these countries].[9]
There are many reasons why poor babies and children die young and poor adults die at an early age. The main reason is 
that they are poor and, because they are poor, they have poor sanitation and poor water supplies, and also insufficient food. 
They thus have a high incidence of water- and excreta-related diseases (discussed in Chapter 2). Diarrhoeal diseases, for 
example, are extremely common (Table 1.2),[10] and they kill around 1.3 million children under 5 every year.[11,12] Rotavirus 
alone kills around 400,000, and norovirus around 200,000, under-5s every year. Most of these deaths are in developing 
countries: 40% occur in Sub-Saharan Africa at a rate of around 2,200 under-5 deaths per day.

Stunting
Stunting, or low height-for-age, is mainly a manifestation of malnutrition. It is a common condition in many developing 
countries (Figure 1.6) where it is generally exacerbated by diarrhoeal diseases and helminthiases (worm infections – 
see Chapter 2). For example, in a 10-year study of 119 slum children in northeast Brazil, children who had had a high 
burden (~9 episodes) of diarrhoeal disease in their first two years of life were on average 3.6 cm shorter at age 7 than 
other children, and those children who had also had an early childhood helminthiasis were on average a further 4.6 cm 
shorter at the same age.[13]

Figure 1.6: World map showing the percentage of children under 5 with low height-for-age.[14]
1.2.3	
Cognitive impairment
Early childhood diarrhoeal diseases and helminthiases, most often in conjunction with malnutrition, result in a loss of 
cognition in older childhood − the areas most affected are verbal fluency, short-term memory and speed of information 
processing, which are precisely the areas most needed for people to be able to contribute to socio-economic development.[13, 
15−17] As a consequence productivity in adult life is less than optimal. Furthermore children with more than one helminthic 
infection experience worse cognitive outcomes than those with only one.[18]
1.3	
Personal Safety and Dignity 
Not having household-level sanitation facilities means that women and girls, particularly adolescent girls, are at risk from 
violence (assault, rape) when they go out, especially at night, to a communal sanitation facility or to defecate in the open.
[19] This deeply affects the personal dignity of everyone, but especially women and adolescent girls:[20]
“Women and girls can be forced to wait until nightfall to defecate, if there are no suitable sanitation facilities for them to 
use in the daytime. … Restricted toilet opportunities increase the chance of urinary tract infection and chronic constipation 
as well as causing psychological stress. It also makes women vulnerable to violence if they are forced to defecate early in 
the morning or after nightfall, in secluded areas, sometimes risking rape and sexual and physical assault. With access to 
appropriate toilets, women and girls can use them at any time, in private, without shame, embarrassment or fear. Making 
defecation less of a problem is a liberating development for women, whose lives can be dominated by this basic need.”
“Water is Life, Sanitation is Dignity” – so: no sanitation, no privacy, no dignity.[21] 
1.4	
Solutions to the Crisis
There are good, low-cost engineering interventions to solve the global sanitation and water-supply crisis. For engineers 
to implement such interventions means that they must:
--
Understand the environmental transmission pathways of water- and excreta-diseases (Chapter 2),
--
and be able to:
--
Design appropriate low-cost sanitation systems in urban and rural areas (Chapter 3),
--
Design appropriate low-cost water-supply systems in urban and rural areas (Chapter 4),
--
Plan low-cost sanitation and water-supply programmes and projects in an effective and all-inclusive manner 
(Chapter 5), and
--
Arrange project financing and develop appropriate pricing mechanisms for low-cost sanitation and water-
supply systems in urban and rural areas (Chapter 6).

IIntroductio n to the  Global  ..
Chapter 1: Key Messages
1.	 In 2008, out of a world population of nearly 6,600 million people, around 2,560 million were without 
access to ‘improved’ sanitation and around 860 million were without access to an ‘improved’ water 
supply. Most of those lacking improved sanitation are in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and most of 
those lacking improved water supplies are in Sub-Saharan Africa.
2.	 The definitions used by WHO and UNICEF for ‘improved’ sanitation and ‘improved’ water 
supplies are based simply on access to specified technologies. The definitions used by UN-Habitat 
for ‘adequate’ sanitation and ‘adequate water supplies are much more appropriate as they include 
satisfactory operation and affordability.
3.	 The MDG sanitation and water-supply targets are only to reduce by half the proportion of people 
without access to improved sanitation and improved water supplies, taking 1990 as the base year. The 
only meaningful target is universal coverage – that is, Adequate Sanitation and Water Supplies for 
All.
4.	 Poor sanitation and poor water supplies lead to a high incidence of water- and excreta-related 
diseases (detailed in Chapter 2), and these diseases result in high infant and under-5 mortality rates 
and a low life-expectancy-at-birth. Physical and cognitive impairment result from high incidences of 
these diseases. This can then lead to decreased productivity in adult life – precisely the opposite of 
what is needed for good socio-economic development.

Diseases
2.1	
Introduction
If people do not have a good water supply or access to a good sanitation facility, their health will suffer. In particular, as 
noted in Section 1.2, they will have one or more of the water- and excreta-related diseases and as a result they may die, be 
seriously ill, or suffer physical and/or cognitive impairment. It is very important for engineers to have a good understanding 
of the relationship between sanitation, water and health – i.e., to understand the water- and excreta-related diseases, so 
that they can design efficient and cost-effective engineering interventions (sanitation and water-supply improvements) 
which prevent, or at least minimize, their environmental transmission. Historically engineers have been very good at doing 
this: thanks to the piped water supplies and sewerage installed in late 19th and early 20th centuries in towns and cities 
of the then industrializing world, the incidence of Water and excreta related diseases in the now industrialized countries 
is very low – and, as a result of this, it can safely be said that engineers have saved more lives than medical doctors ever 
have or ever will. However, the current sanitation and water-supply crisis in low-income countries means that engineers 
and other professionals (behavioural scientists, hygiene specialists, social anthropologists, specialists in public health 
medicine) have a vast amount of work to do to provide poor people in low-income countries with good sanitation and 
water supplies – to improve both their health and their quality of life.

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
2.2	
The Global Health Impact of Water and excreta related diseases
Unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene, which together are the main cause of Water and excreta related diseases throughout 
the world, but principally in low- and middle-income countries, have a huge adverse health impact − for example, in 
low- and middle-income countries in 2004:[1]
• 
Mortality: unsafe water, unsafe sanitation, and poor personal and domestic hygiene were responsible for ~1.6 
million deaths, of which ~1.4 million were of children under the age of 5 due mainly to diarrhoeal diseases 
[in high-income countries the corresponding number of deaths was ~4,000]; and
• 
Burden of disease: unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene were responsible for a total burden of disease of 
~57 million disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs − see Box 2.1 for an explanation of DALYs) [in high-
income countries the corresponding burden of disease was just under 300,000 DALYs].

Environmental Classification of Water and excreta related diseases
2.3.1	
 Why an Environmental Classification?
Why do we need an environmental classification of Water and excreta related diseases? Simply because we are not medical 
doctors and so lists of diseases related to defects in sanitation and water supplies, either an alphabetical list or one that 
groups the diseases according to the biological type of the organisms causing the diseases (i.e., viral, bacterial, protozoan 
and helminthic diseases – helminths are worms), are just not meaningful to us. What

Box 2.1: Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) Losses
The various hazards that can be present in water can have very different health outcomes. Some outcomes are mild (e.g., 
diarrhoea,), while others can be severe (cholera, haemolytic uraemic syndrome associated with E. coli O157, or cancer); 
some are acute (diarrhoea), while others are delayed (infectious hepatitis, cancer); some especially relate to certain age 
ranges and groups (skeletal fluorosis in older adults often arises from long-term exposure to high levels of fluoride in 
childhood; infection with hepatitis E virus has a very high mortality rate among pregnant women). In addition, any 
one hazard may cause multiple effects (e.g., gastroenteritis, Gullain-Barré syndrome, reactive arthritis and mortality 
associated with Campylobacter).
In order to support public health priority setting a common metric is required that can be applied to all types of hazard 
and takes into account different health outcomes including probabilities, severities and durations of effects. Disability-
adjusted Life Years (DALYs) provides this metric. The basic principle of the DALY is to weight each health impact in 
terms of severity within the range of 0 for good health to 1 for death. The weighting is then multiplied by duration of the 
effect and the number of people affected. In the case of death duration is regarded as the years lost in relation to normal 
life expectancy (taken as 70 years). Using this approach a mild diarrhoea with a severity weighting of 0.1 and lasting for 
7 days results in a DALY loss of [(0.1 × 7)/365] – i.e., 0.002; while death resulting in a loss of 30 years of life equates to a 
DALY loss of 30. [Strictly speaking DALY losses have units of years, but generally they are just expressed as a number.]
Hence, DALYs = YLL (years of life lost) + YLD (years lived with a disability or illness) − in this context disability refers 
to conditions that detract from good health.
Calculation of DALY losses
Infection with rotavirus (in developed countries), for example, causes:
• 
mild diarrhoea (severity rating of 0.1) lasting 7 days in 97.5% of cases
• 
severe diarrhoea (severity rating of 0.23) lasting 7 days in 2.5% of cases
• 
the death (severity rating of 1) of very young children in 0.015% of cases
The DALY loss per case of rotavirus diarrhoea is then:
i.e., 0.0125 [years].
Infection with Cryptosporidium can cause watery diarrhoea (severity weighting of 0.067) lasting for 7 days with extremely 
rare deaths in 0.0001% of cases. This equates to a DALY loss per case of cryptosporidiosis of 0.0015 [years].

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
we, as engineers, need is an environmental classification as this groups the diseases into several categories, in each of which 
the environmental transmission pathways of the disease-causing organisms (the ‘pathogens’) are the same or very similar, 
and so an engineering intervention (e.g., a sanitation or water-supply improvement) against the transmission of one disease 
in a particular category will be equally effective against the transmission of all the other diseases in that category. Thus 
fully understanding the environmental classification of Water and excreta related diseases enables us engineers to design 
engineering interventions (i.e., sanitation and water-supply improvements) to be highly effective against the environmental 
transmission of Water and excreta related diseases.
2.3.2	
Environmental Classifications
An environmental classification of water-related disease was developed by Professor David Bradley (of the London 
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine – LSHTM) when he was working in East Africa in the late 1960s,[3] and an 
environmental classification of excreta-related diseases was developed by Professor Sir Richard Feachem (now of the 
University of California San Francisco) and colleagues at LSHTM in the late 1970s.[4] What is presented in Table 2.1 is a 
unitary environmental classification of both water- and excreta-related diseases.[5] Details of all the diseases mentioned 
in the table are available on the websites of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health 
Organization;[7,8] online search engines also readily provide disease information. 
Some of these diseases and their environmental transmission pathways are more important than others in the sense that 
they cause more illnesses and/or more deaths (or, as medical doctors and epidemiologists would say, they cause greater 
morbidity and/or mortality), and these are detailed below.

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
Important environmental transmission pathways for water-related diseases
(a) Waterborne diseases
Waterborne diseases are caused by a pathogen present in drinking water (or water used for drinking – hundreds of millions 
of people in developing countries drink contaminated water). If a sufficient number of a pathogen is ingested, then the 
disease it causes becomes established in the person or persons drinking the water. The waterborne transmission route was 
first demonstrated by Dr John Snow in Soho, London during the cholera epidemic of 1854 (Box 2.1).[9] 
The largest outbreak of a waterborne disease – cryptosporidiosis − occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin during March-April 
1993 due to a malfunction at one of the city’s water treatment plants.[10] A total of ~403,000 people, around a quarter of 
the population of Greater Milwaukee, became ill. The total cost of the outbreak was estimated to be US$ 96.3 million 
($31.7 million in medical costs and $64.6 million in productivity losses; 1993 $).[11]
(b) Water-washed diseases
Water-washed diseases are caused by a lack of adequate volumes of water – water for drinking but also, and more 
importantly, water for personal and domestic hygiene. If people do not have sufficient water to keep themselves and their 
house, especially their kitchen (or food preparation and cooking area) clean, they will have skin and eye diseases (such 
as scabies and trachoma – trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness[12]), and diarrhoea, dysentery – in fact 
any of the diseases that can be waterborne. This is because both waterborne and water-washed diseases (other than the 
skin and eye infections) have the same basic transmission pathway: the pathogens have to get from the anus of one person 
into the mouth of another person – i.e., they are both faeco-oral diseases (Category A in Table 2.1). 
Water-washed faeco-oral diseases have very direct person-to-person transmission routes, whereas waterborne faeco-oral 
diseases have a much less direct transmission route (Box 2.2). This raises an important question: 
In an ideal world both water-quality improvements (i.e., removing pathogens from drinking water by water treatment − 
filtration and disinfection, for example) and water-quantity improvements would be

made. But in rural areas of developing countries, which are generally far removed from any ideal world, there is typically 
not the money to do both, so the question has to be answered – and the answer is that water quantity should be increased 
first since most faeco-oral disease transmission occurs via the water-washed route, not the waterborne route, especially in 
communities with inadequate water supplies (of which there are many − see section 1.1). There is also the huge problem 
of correctly operating and maintaining water treatment plants (even very simple ones) in rural areas, particularly getting 
supplies of disinfectants – typically chlorine – to the treatment plant on time).

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
Box 2.2: The Broad Street Pump – London, 1854
“The most terrible outbreak of cholera which ever occurred in this kingdom, is probably that which took place in 
Broad Street, Golden Square, and the adjoining streets, a few weeks ago. Within two hundred and fifty yards of the spot 
where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street, there were upwards of five hundred fatal attacks of cholera in ten days. The 
mortality in this limited area probably equals any that was ever caused in this country, even by the plague; and it was 
much more sudden, as the greater number of cases terminated in a few hours. The mortality would undoubtedly have 
been much greater had it not been for the flight of the population: … in less than six days from the commencement 
of the outbreak, the most afflicted streets were deserted by more than three-quarters of their inhabitants.
There were a few cases of cholera in the neighbourhood of Broad Street, Golden Square, in the latter part of August; 
and the so-called outbreak, which commenced in the night between the 31st August and the 1st September was, as 
in all similar instances, only a violent increase of the malady. As soon as I became acquainted with the situation and 
extent of this irruption of cholera, I suspected some contamination of the water of the much-frequented street pump 
in Broad Street, near the end of Cambridge Street. … On proceeding to the spot, I found that nearly all the deaths 
had taken place within a short distance of the pump. … The result of the inquiry then was, that there had been no 
particular outbreak or increase of cholera, in this part of London, except among the persons who were in the habit of 
drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump-web. I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St. James’s 
parish, on the evening of Thursday, 7th September, and represented the above circumstances to them. In consequence 
of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed on the following day.”
John Snow, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, 1855.[9]
Box 2.3: Transmission routes of faeco-oral diseases
Faeco-oral diseases occur when a sufficient number of a pathogen in the faeces of one person enters the mouth of 
another person. Likely transmission routes are:
1.	 Faeces of person A → fingers of person A → mouth of person B (imagine two very small children playing: 
they commonly put their fingers into each other’s mouths),
2.	 Faeces of person A → fingers of person A → fingers of person B → mouth of person B (two people shaking 
hands),
3.	 Faeces of person A → fingers of person A → food → mouths of persons B, C, D, etc. (a mother preparing 
food for her family), and 
4.	 Faeces of person A → water → mouths of persons B, C, D, etc.
Routes #1−3 are examples of the very direct person-to-person water-washed transmission route, and route #4 is the 
waterborne route.
In poor communities with inadequate water supplies routes #1−3 are likely to occur much more frequently than route 
#4. This is not to say that waterborne diseases are unimportant, but just that water-washed diseases are more important.

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
Important environmental transmission pathways for excreta-related diseases
(a) Faeco-oral diseases
The faeco-oral diseases are a good example of diseases that are both water- and excreta-related. It might appear best to 
control them by the provision of sanitation to isolate people from their excreta; however, because faeco-oral diseases are 
most commonly spread by the water-washed transmission route, the provision of an adequate water supply, together 
with hygiene promotion – especially the promotion of hand-washing with soap, is more important than sanitation (this 
does not mean that sanitation is unimportant, just that an adequate water supply and good hygiene are more important).
(b) Geohelminthiases
These are the diseases caused by the soil-transmitted helminths (or worms) (Category C in Table 2.1). The four main 
geohelminths are Ascaris lumbricoides, the large human roundworm (Figure 2.1); Trichuris trichiura, the human whipworm; 
and Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, the two human hookworms − diagrams of the life cycles of these 
helminths are given on the website of CDC’s Division of Parasitic Diseases.[13] The geohelminthiases are extremely common 
infections: ~1.2 billion people have ascariasis, ~800 million have trichuriasis, and ~740 million have hookworm infection.
[14] They are very common in periurban slums where it is not unusual for over 90% of the community to be infected with 
one or more of these worms. Ascaris is often the most common, due in part to the adult female worm producing ~200,000 
eggs per day. Hookworms hook into the lining of the stomach and suck blood, so hookworm infection is particularly 
problematic for women of child-bearing age as the blood loss due to the hookworms can exceed that due to menstruation 
and this often leads to anaemia.

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
Figure 2.1: This 4-year old girl was given a worm-expellant drug and she excreted this very large number of Ascaris worms (each worm is about 
the size of a pencil).
(c) Water-based helminthiases:
These are the diseases caused by trematode worms that spend part of their life cycle in one or more intermediate aquatic 
hosts (Category E in Table 2.1). A good example is shistosomiasis (also called bilharzia), which infects 250−300 million 
people.[13] The eggs are voided in the faeces or urine (depending on the species of schistosome), they hatch in water and 
enter a freshwater snail (typically of the genus Biomphalaria). Massive asexual multiplication occurs in the snail from 
which thousands of ‘cercariae’ escape; these are the infective form of the worm and they have to find a human host within 
48 hours (or they die); they penetrate the skin of anyone in the water (children playing in the water, women washing 
clothes in the water, men fishing in the water) and grow to adulthood in the body. The adult worms live in the portal 
veins near the liver and the eggs leave the body by boring through the bladder wall or the colon (depending on species) 
– over many years this causes cancer (section 2.2.4). Some eggs, however, end up in the liver where they are encapsulated; 
having just a few encapsulated schistosome eggs in the liver is not cause for major concern, but having many/very many 
encapsulated eggs in the liver means that the liver is not able to function well – and, if your liver is not able to function 
properly, then neither are you.
Insect- and rodent-vector diseases
The insect-vector diseases (Category F in Table 2.1) include several very important diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, 
dengue fever and lymphatic (Bancroftian) filariasis. Malaria kills nearly 1 million young children a year, mainly in Sub-
Saharan Africa where it is responsible for 20% of child deaths.[15] Lymphatic filariasis, caused by the worm Wuchereria 
bancrofti, can be particularly unpleasant – in its clinical extreme it is known as elephantiasis, manifested by gross swelling 
of the genitalia and/or lower limbs (Figure 2.2); this is due to the adult worms blocking the lymphatic system so that it 
cannot drain.

Figure 2.2: A case of elephantiasis.
The principal rodent-vector disease (Category G in Table 2.1) is leptospirosis, caused by the bacterium Leptospira 
interrogans. It is primarily a disease of rats and the pathogen is shed in the rat’s urine; people become infected when they 
come into contact with water contaminated with rat urine and if they have cuts or abrasions in their skin. The pathogen 
enters the body through the cut or abrasion and causes initially a mild flu-like fever which, if untreated, quickly turns to 
Weil’s disease – failure of the liver and kidneys and, soon thereafter, death. 
2.3.3	
Water-related Cancers
It may seem counter-intuitive that certain cancers and water-related diseases are interrelated, but they are. The relationships 
between them closely follow Bradley’s original environmental classification of water-related diseases, as shown in Table 
2.2.[16] For example, in shistosomiasis-endemic countries bladder cancer occurring under the age of 50 is almost always 
due to chronic infection with Schistosoma haematobium, the eggs of which leave the body in the urine.[17]

Water- and Excreta-related Diseases
What Makes Cities Healthy?
This World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, published in 2007, answers the question posed in its title as follows: 
“The benefits of good health to individuals and to society are strongly positive and improving the health of the poor 
is a key Millennium Development Goal. If the objective is better health outcomes at the least cost and a reduction in 
urban health inequity, this research suggests that the four most potent policy interventions are: water and sanitation 
systems; urban land use and transport planning; effective primary care and health programs aimed at influencing 
diets and lifestyles; and education. The payoff from these four in terms of health outcomes dwarfs the returns from 
new drugs and hospital-based curative medicine.” Available online at: http://go.worldbank.org/ZI8RS10F70.
Chapter 2: Key Messages
1.	 Inadequate water supplies and inadequate sanitation, together with poor personal and domestic 
hygiene, are the cause of water- and excreta-related diseases.
2.	 Water- and excreta-related diseases have a very high adverse health impact in low- and middle-income 
countries.
3.	 The environmental classification of water- and excreta-related diseases groups these diseases into 
categories defined by a common environmental transmission route, so enabling engineers to design 
effective sanitation and water-supply interventions.
4.	 Prolonged exposure to some water- and excreta-related pathogens can induce cancer.

Sanitation Systems
3	 Sanitation Systems
If people do not have a good water supply or access to a good sanitation facility, their health will suffer – in particular, as noted 
in Section 1.2, they will have one or more of the water- and excreta-related diseases detailed in Table 2.1, most commonly 
diarrhoeal diseases and one or more of the geohelminthiases. This chapter introduces some of the better low-cost sanitation 
systems that can be used in rural and urban areas. The effective management of human excreta for health requires that it is 
collected and stored safely, completely separated from human contact. Where space is insufficient excreta and related wastes 
(water and anal cleansing material) may need to be transported elsewhere for treatment. In some cases specialised treatment 
is needed particularly if excreta are to be re-used (for the production of energy or as agricultural fertilizer) or if their disposal 
presents an unacceptable risk to downstream water supplies. In rural areas treatment ‘at the point of production’ is usually 
possible. In dense urban settlements there is rarely sufficient space for this type of ‘on-site’ treatment and transport may be 
needed. In this book we are limiting our discussion to the design and delivery of systems for safe collection, onsite treatment 
where there is sufficient space and low-cost transport options for dense urban areas. Readers are referred to other sources 
for more information on appropriate treatment options for re-use and disposal of large volumes of sewage. 
3.1	
Rural Areas
3.1.1	
Ending open defecation
In 2008 there were some 1,100 million ‘open defecators’ (i.e., people with no access to any sanitation facility whatsoever and 
so forced to defecate in the open) in the world and most of them lived in rural areas – 29% of the global rural population 
were ‘ODers’ in 2008 vs. only 5% of the global urban population.[1] 
Community-led Total Sanitation
The CLTS movement was pioneered in Bangladesh in 2000 by Dr Kamal Kar, together with VERC (Village Education 
Resource Centre, a local NGO) and WaterAid Bangladesh, to end open defecation (OD) in rural areas. It involves the 
whole community and helps it to become ‘open-defecation free’ (ODF). CLTS has now spread to other countries in Asia 
(in India it is the government-run ‘Total Sanitation Campaign’) and to several countries in Africa.

Sanitation Systems
Kar describes it as follows:[2]
“CLTS focuses on igniting a change in sanitation behaviour rather than constructing toilets. It does this through a 
process of social awakening that is stimulated by facilitators from within or outside the community. It concentrates 
on the whole community rather than on individual behaviours. Collective benefit from stopping open defecation can 
encourage a more cooperative approach. People decide together how they will create a clean and hygienic environment 
that benefits everyone. It is fundamental that CLTS involves no individual household hardware subsidy and does 
not prescribe latrine models. Social solidarity, help and cooperation among the households in the community are 
a common and vital element in CLTS. Other important characteristics are the spontaneous emergence of Natural 
Leaders as a community proceeds towards ODF status; local innovations of low cost toilet models using locally 
available materials, and community-innovated systems of reward, penalty, spread and scaling-up. CLTS encourages 
the community to take responsibility and to take its own action. In its fullest sense, total sanitation includes a range 
of behaviours such as: stopping all open defecation; ensuring that everyone uses a hygienic toilet; washing hands 
with soap before preparing food and eating, after using the toilet, and after contact with babies’ faeces, or birds and 
animals; handling food and water in a hygienic manner; and safe disposal of animal and domestic waste to create a 
clean and safe environment. CLTS concentrates on ending OD as a first significant step and entry point to changing 
behaviour. It starts by enabling people to do their own sanitation profile through appraisal, observation and analysis 
of their practices of OD and the effects these have. This kindles feelings of shame and disgust, and often a desire to 
stop OD and clean up their neighbourhood.”
A word of caution is in order: in Pakistan it was found that “CLTS had the potential to motivate communities to achieve 
ODF status. However, it did not create demand for ‘improved sanitation’ [Table 1.1], which implies use of sanitation 
facilities that ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact. The communities surveyed were found 
using unimproved and unhygienic latrines without taking any substantial effort to upgrade or replace damaged latrines due 
to limited knowledge of different latrine options available at the household level”.[3] Clearly CLTS-beneficiary communities 
need at least some sanitation and hygiene knowledge so that, when they move from open defecation to fixed-place 
defecation, the fixed place they use is at least an improved sanitation facility − CLTS programmes need to be sustainable.[4] 
3.1.2	
Arborloos
In dispersed rural areas often the most suitable sanitation system is the Arborloo (Figure 3.1).[5] This is a shallow pit latrine 
(typically 0.8 m in diameter and 1 m deep) which is used for 6−12 months. After each time the latrine is used soil, ash or 
leaves are added to the pit (after one use add one of these, after the next use one of the other two, and after the third use 
the remaining one, and so on – this ensures good humus production in the pit). When the pit is full to within around 20 
cm of the ground surface the latrine superstructure is placed over a new pit, and the full pit covered with soil and a fruit 
or medicinal tree planted in it. Eventually the household has an orchard of high-value trees which generates both high-
quality fruit and an income from the sale of excess fruit and/or medicinal products – “excreta in, money out”. In many 
rural households the men are away working in nearby towns or mines and the women generally like the Arborloo as they 
can dig the shallow pits themselves quite easily; moreover there is the advantage that, while the nutrients in the excreta 
are used to fertilize the trees, there is no handling of either faeces or urine (which many people would find repugnant).

3.1.3	
Single-pit ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines
VIP latrines have their superstructure slightly off-set from the pit to permit the installation of a vertical vent pipe which 
is fitted with a fly screen at its top (Figure 3.2).[6] The vent pipe has two functions: odour control and fly control (in 
contrast traditional − i.e., unventilated − pit latrines generally have serious odour and fly problems). The wind 
blowing across the top of the vent pipe sucks air out of the vent pipe, so creating a flow of air from outside 
the superstructure, down through the squat hole (or pedestal seat unit), and up and out of the vent pipe, 
taking with it all the malodorous gases from the decomposing faeces in the pit, so leaving the superstructure 
completely odour-free. Gravid female flies are attracted to the top of the vent pipe by the faecal odours coming 
out of it, but the fly screen blocks their entry, so they cannot enter the pit to lay their eggs. However, a few flies 
will enter the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs in the pit; eventually these eggs become newly emergent 
adult flies, which always fly in the direction of the strongest light they can see. Provided the superstructure is 
kept reasonably dark, the strongest source of light they are able to see is the shaft of light coming down the 
vent pipe and so the newly emergent adult flies fly up the vent pipe, but the fly screen blocks their exit; due to 
a lack of food they quickly die and fall down into the pit.
In all other respects VIP latrines function like any other pit latrine: the faeces slowly decompose in the pit and the urine 
and any water used to clean the squat slab or pedestal seat infiltrate into the surrounding soil. Typically the pit is 1−1.5 
m in diameter, with a depth of ~3 m, and the vent pipe diameter is 100−150 mm (or ~225 mm square if the vent pipe is 
made of locally burnt bricks). The cover slab is raised 300 mm above ground level if the groundwater table is within 300 
mm of ground level (either permanently or seasonally).

Sanitation Systems
Single-pit VIP latrines are normally designed for an effective life of 10 years (the necessary design calculations are detailed 
in Annex A). After 10 years, when the pit is full to within ~30 cm of ground level, a new pit is dug and the coverslab, vent 
pipe and as much of the superstructure as possible are put in place over the new pit, which is used for the next 10 years. 
After the second 10 years the pit used during the first 10 years can be safely excavated and used again for the third 10 years.
3.1.4	
Single-pit pour-flush (PF) toilets
Single-pit PF toilets (Figure 3.2) are used in rural areas, where there is space for a second pit to be constructed when 
the first is full [they can also be used in small towns and large villages (section 3.2) if there is sufficient space for them 
and they can be emptied mechanically (section 3.2.4)].[7,8] Squat-pans or pedestal-seat units with an integral water seal 
are used, depending on the users’ preference; the water seal prevents insects and odours from the leach pit entering the 
superstructure. The excreta (faeces and urine) are manually flushed with 2−3 litres of water into an adjacent leach pit. 
The leach pit is always lined to prevent soil erosion by the flush water. 
Single-pit PF toilets are, like single-pit VIP latrines, normally designed for an effective life of 10 years (the necessary 
design calculations are detailed in Annex A). After 10 years, when the leach pit is full to within ~30 cm of ground level, 
a new leach pit is dug and the squat-pan or pedestal seat unit and as much of the superstructure as possible are put in 
place over the new pit, which is used for the next 10 years. After the second 10 years the leach pit used during the first 
10 years can be safely excavated and used again for the third 10 years.

3.1.5	
Greywater
‘Greywater’ (also called ‘sullage’) is all the non-toilet/latrine wastewater produced by a household, so it includes wastewater 
from sinks, including kitchen sinks, showers and baths. Of course, in rural areas of developing countries households 
needing latrines are unlikely to have sinks, showers or baths, but they do produce some greywater from food preparation 
and clothes washing – usually around 10−20 litres per person per day. This relatively small quantity of greywater should 
be disposed of hygienically in, for example, a small greywater leach pit (typically 0.8−1 m in diameter and 1−1.5 m deep, 
filled with stones or brickbats); or it could be used to water a vegetable plot adjacent to the house.[9]
3.1.6	
Groundwater pollution
There is the danger that viral and bacterial pathogens from VIP latrine pits and PF toilet leach pits can contaminate the 
groundwater (helminth eggs and protozoan (oo)cysts are too big to travel through soil). They do cause groundwater 
contamination in some circumstances – for example, in fractured rock and coarse sands – but not in all circumstances. 
The unsturated zone (the partially saturated soil layer between the pit base and the groundwater table) is very effective in 
reducing the travel of viruses and bacteria, especially if its depth is 2 m or more.[13] A distance of 10−15 m between the 
latrine and a shallow well is generally sufficient to minimize groundwater contamination. If it is actually very important 
to prevent groundwater pollution (and it may not be – it is better to have the groundwater contaminated than the ground 
around houses), then the latrine pit should be sealed at its base with lean concrete and a 0.5-m annulus of fine (< 1 mm) 
sand inserted between the pit lining and the surrounding soil[10] – sand is especially effective in preventing the travel of 
viruses.

Small towns and large villages
In small towns and large villages some or all of the systems described in Section 3.1 as suitable for use in rural areas may 
also be suitable, depending on the population density. In some cases the density of houses may be higher than typical in 
true rural areas. Villages in India, for example, can have populations of up to around 10,000 people and so are not really 
rural, at least from the perspective of sanitation and water supply − the word ‘rurban’ has been coined to describe such 
large rural communities as, although they may be officially classified as rural, their sanitation and water-supply needs are 
more urban than rural. This section describes additional sanitation options that are appropriate in small towns and large 
villages − which can be considered as low- to medium-density urban areas.
3.2.1	
eThekwini Latrines
eThekwini latrines (named after the municipality in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where they were developed) are urine-
diverting alternating twin-vault ventilated improved vault latrines (or UD-VIVs, for short)[11]. They are wholly above 
ground and comprise two separately ventilated vaults which receive only faeces and anal cleansing materials; the urine, 
diverted in a specially designed toilet bowl or squat-plate, is discharged into a small adjacent soakaway − this is done 
to keep the vault contents from becoming too wet, so they can dehydrate easily (Figure 3.4). One vault is used for 12 
months, when the other vault is put into service; after the second vault has been used for ~11 months the first vault is 
emptied by the householder (using a long-handled shovel; the vault contents are buried on site), so that the first vault can 
be put back into service at the beginning of the third year. This sequence of alternating vault usage continues indefinitely. 
The design calculations for the required vault volumes are detailed in Annex A. In some locations, usually in rural areas, 
where appropriate markets exist, treated excreta from e-Thekwini latrines can be used or even sold as a fertilizer (urine) 
or soil conditioner (faeces). 
The principal advantage of eThekwini latrines over ventilated improved pit latrines (Section 3.1.2) is their much greater 
ease of emptying. For this reason alternating twin-pit VIP latrines[6] are not described here as eThekwini latrines are 
generally to be preferred.

Alternating twin-pit PF toilets
The two leach pits of alternating twin-pit PF toilets (Figure 3.5) are operated in the same alternating sequence as the twin 
vaults in eThekwini latrines. The excreta are flushed into the leach pit in use via a flow-diversion box, the outlet of which 
to the leach pit not in use is blocked off by a brick wrapped in hessian sacking (Figure 3.6). Each leach pit is normally used 
for two years (rather than one year, as with the eThekwini latrine vaults) to ensure that all pathogens, with the exception 
of a few Ascaris eggs, are dead, so permitting safe manual emptying (section 3.2.4).[7,8]

Biogas toilets
Biogas toilets are another simple sanitation option for small towns and large villages.[12] Households have pour-flush toilet 
squat-pans (section 3.1.3) which discharge into a small anaerobic digester from which the biogas is collected and used for 
cooking and/or other domestic purposes (e.g., lighting). To increase biogas yields animal excreta are also often added to 
the digester. At intervals of 1−2 years the digester is desludged and the sludge so removed is either buried on site or used 
to fertilize a small vegetable plot. There are many such biogas toilets, especially in the Far East. In small towns in Vietnam 
most households have 3−4 pigs and both the pig and human excreta are discharged into a 1-m3 anaerobic digester, and 
the resulting biogas is used for cooking (Figure 3.7).

However, manual emptying of the pits of single-pit latrines is not recommended as it is not only degrading work but also 
very hazardous as the workers are exposed to viable excreted pathogens, even when they are provided with protective 
clothing (which is the exception, not the rule).[13] Mechanical pit emptying should be employed instead, but even this is 
difficult, especially with ‘dry’ pits [i.e., pits with their base above the groundwater table – if the pit is a ‘wet’ pit (base above 
the goundwater table) then standard vacuum tankers of the type used to desludge septic tanks can be used]. Part of the 
difficulty is due to the pits frequently being used for garbage disposal (Figure 3.8). Large powerful vacuum tankers able to 
empty dry pits have been developed,[14] but they are very expensive and are often unable to get sufficiently near the pits to 
empty them. Smaller tankers are now preferred; UN-Habitat developed the ‘vacutug’ for example (Figure 3.9).[15] In very 
dense urban communities, it may be more appropriate to design much smaller pits (not more than 1m deep for example) 
and plan for frequent emptying. This would facilitate the development of economically viable small mechanised emptiers.

Greywater
In small towns and large villages greywater can be disposed of in greywater leach pits (section 3.1.4) if there is space for 
them, used to water vegetable plots if there are any, or discharged together with stormwater in covered drains (as shown 
in Figure 3.7, top left).[9]
3.2.6	
Groundwater pollution
Due to the higher population density and thus higher latrine density in small towns and large villages groundwater 
contamination is more likely than in rural areas. Thus all VIP latrine pits and PF toilet leach pits should be built with a 
sand annulus as described in section 3.1.6, unless the groundwater is not used as a supply of drinking water.

Urbanization
Almost all population growth in the world over the next 40 years or so is expected to be in urban areas in developing 
countries, where the population is expected to increase from 2,500 million in 2009 to 3,520 million by 2025 and to 5,190 
million by 2050 (Figure 3.10). Many (if not most) of these new urban residents will live in high-density low-income areas, 
including slums, where water and sanitation needs will be especially acute. Because of the high population densities in 
these areas on-site sanitation systems are not normally feasible, and therefore off-site systems such as simplified sewerage, 
low-cost combined sewerage, and community-managed sanitation blocks are more suitable.

Simplified sewerage
Sewerage is a network of pipes (‘sewers’) that takes away all the domestic wastewater (toilet wastewater and greywater) 
from the houses where it is generated, to be treated and then disposed of elsewhere (often into a surface water or for use 
in aquaculture and/or agriculture). Conventional sewerage – the type of sewerage used in towns and cities in industrialized 
countries – uses very conservative values for minimum sewer diameters, gradients and depths which have accrued in design 
codes of practice over the last hundred years or so, with the result that per household construction costs are extremely high 
– certainly too high for low-income urban communities in developing countries. With simplified sewerage (also known 
as ‘condominial’ sewerage), which was developed in northeast Brazil in the early 1980s to serve high-density low-income 
urban areas, these very conservative design codes are relaxed in order to reduce the sewer diameter, minimum gradient 
and depth, and thus costs, while maintaining rigorous hydraulic design principles − in fact simplified sewerage is more 
rigorously designed than conventional sewerage (the hydraulic design of simplified sewerage is detailed in Annex B).[17-19] 
Simplified sewer networks are very flexible, with the sewers laid inside a housing block, in the front garden, or under the 
pavement (sidewalk), rather than in the centre of the road as with conventional sewerage (Figure 3.11). This results in 
considerably less disruption to existing structures and major cost savings in construction. Simplified sewerage is appropriate 
both for existing unplanned periurban settlements and also for new housing estates with more regular layouts. As the 
population density increases, simplified sewerage becomes less expensive than on-site sanitation systems: in northeast 
Brazil this occurred at a population density of ~160 persons per ha (Figure 3.12), which is not a particularly high density; 
in South Africa the corresponding figure is ~200 persons per ha.
Figure 3.11: Typical layouts for conventional sewerage (left) and simplified sewerage (right). Conventional sewerage layouts are relatively 
inflexible and have long (and hence expensive) house connections. In contrast simplified sewerage is more flexible, with front-yard, back-yard 
and sidewalk (pavement) options. In poor areas the backyard option is generally the most appropriate choice as it is the cheapest.

The minimum sewer diameter used in simplified sewerage is 100 mm and, for a minimum tractive tension of 1 kN/m2 
(which ensures self-cleansing of the sewer), the minimum sewer gradient is 1 in 200 (i.e., 5‰) – see Annex B for details. 
A 100-mm diameter sewer laid at this gradient can serve ~200 households of five persons with a water consumption of 
100 litres per person per day. A capital-cost comparison between conventional and simplified sewerage for the mining 
town of Parauapebas in the northern Brazilian state of Pará is given in Table 3.1, which shows that the cost of simplified 
sewerage is ~60% of that of conventional sewerage.[20] The unit (per household) costs of simplified sewerage fall as density 
rises. An analysis of the Paraupeabas case indicated that simplified sewerage would be cheaper than onsite options at 
a density of around 160 persons per hectare. Recent analysis for Soweto, Johannesburg showed a similar pattern, with 
simplified sewerage being cheaper than e-Thekwini latrines at a density of around 125 persons per hectare. [21]

Grande do Norte the monthly cost per household in January 2008 was the equivalent of USD 3.50, which was only 1.7% 
of the local minimum wage – so simplified sewerage, done properly, is clearly affordable. Such are its advantages that the 
water and sewerage company for Brasíliaand the Federal District now only uses simplified sewerage in both rich and poor 
areas alike (and rich areas in Brasília are very rich indeed).

In upstream parts of the network, where the flow is intermittent, wastewater solids are gradually moved along the sewer each 
time a toilet is flushed. This transport process of ‘move → settle → move → settle’ is much more efficient in small diameter 
sewers than in unnecessarily large diameter sewers (remember the hydraulic dictum: “small flows flow better in small 
sewers”). PVC pipes are normally used as they are simply and reliably jointed, so there is minimal leakage or infiltration. 
Simple low-cost sewer junctions and cleanout and inspection units are used in place of expensive manholes (Figure 3.13). 
Figure 3.13: Simple plastic junction box used in simplified sewerage instead of expensive manholes.
Operation and maintenance is straightforward. In Brazil the state water and sewerage companies (SWC) use several 
methods of O&M. For example, in Brasília residents report blockages to their local SWC office which then despatches a 
van equipped with a water-jet unit; this is inserted in a junction box upstream of the blockage which is jetted to the next 
downstream junction box from where it is removed. In Recife in the northeastern state of Pernambuco the SWC employs 
small local engineering firms to do the O&M: typically a firm locates a technician engineer and 1−2 labourers in the area 
it is responsible for to whom residents report any blockages; the team then visits the blocked sewer and clears it manually.
A word of caution: for simplified sewerage to succeed well, the local water and sewerage agency must work closely with 
the community to ensure all community members understand how the system works, what their responsibilities are, and 
how much they have to pay; if this is not carefully done, the system is likely to fail.[23]

Health benefits of simplified sewerage
Simplified sewerage was installed in Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia in northeast Brazil, on a very large scale in 
the mid-1990s: serving over one million people, it represents “probably the largest single application of the condominial 
[simplified sewerage] model”.[20] During 1994−96 the system was almost entirely confined to the highly precarious urban 
slums, but from 1997 it began to be applied throughout the city, regardless of the type of topography, style of urbanization, 
or income of the beneficiary communities. A rigorous epidemiological study, done before and after the intervention, found 
that diarrhoeal-disease prevalence in children under the age of three fell by 22% on average, but in the poorest areas it fell 
by 43%.[24] A second city-wide study found that the prevalence of intestinal parasites in children under the age of five also 
fell: Ascaris lumbricoides from 24% to 12%, Trichiura trichuria from 18% to 5%, and Giardia duodenalis from 14% to 5%.[25]
3.3.3	
Low-cost combined sewerage
‘Combined’ sewerage is the term used to describe a sewer system that conveys both municipal wastewater and stormwater. 
Low-cost combined sewerage was developed in low-income coastal areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which were 
subject to regular flooding.[26] It was found to be less expensive than simplified sewerage and separate stormwater drainage. 
The sewer has to convey the dry-weather wastewater flow and the stormwater flow when it rains. In residential areas the 
stormwater flow which results from a 5-year storm (i.e., a storm that can be expected to occur, on average, once every 
5 years) is used for design; in commercial/industrial areas the flow from a 10-year storm is used. The hydraulic design 
procedure is described in Annex C.

A similar system is used in India and Vietnam, but the household wastewater is first discharged into a septic tank and the 
tank effluent goes, together with the stormwater, into an open drain;[27,28] otherwise the design principles are as detailed 
in Annex C.
3.3.4	
Community-managed sanitation blocks
In high-density low-income urban areas, especially slum areas, often the only viable sanitation system is community-
managed sanitation blocks of the type promoted by SPARC (the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres, an 
Indian NGO − www.sparcindia.org). These sanitation blocks are designed, built, owned and managed by the communities 
they serve: they are for the use of the community members, who pay for its upkeep − they are in no sense public facilities, 
although a community may allow casual use on payment of a per-use fee.[29] 
These sanitation blocks are better designed and managed than conventional government-funded and contractor-built 
communal toilet blocks and they cost less. This model of community-designed, built and managed sanitation blocks is 
easily adaptable to other sociocultural settings: the key point is that each sanitation block is designed, built and managed 
by the community it serves. Generally help from a local NGO is required initially to catalyze community activity and to 
interact, on behalf of the community, with and obtain financial support from the local city or town council, which may 
not at the beginning take the views of poor slum communities seriously.
The SPARC approach has been successfully transferred to Kibera (Africa’s largest slum) in Nairobi (Figure 3.14) by the 
Kenyan NGOs Maji na Ufanisi (‘Water and Development’) and the Umande Trust.[30-32]

kitchen; bottom: underneath the ground floor is a large anaerobic digester which receives all the wastewater from the sanitation block; the 
biogas generated in the digester is used for cooking in the kitchen on the top floor.

Sociocultural factors
Many societies have traditional views and taboos about sanitation in general and faeces in particular – for example, (1) if 
you are a man, your mother-in-law cannot use the same latrine as you do (but your next-door neighbour’s mother-in-law 
can); (2) diarrhoea is the manifestation of an angry god; and (3) if your enemy has some of your faeces he has ‘control’ 
over you, so why would you excrete in a latrine where he can easily find some? A sensible sanitation engineer or planner 
would not dismiss such views (certainly not in front of the community), but instead work with the community to resolve 
any conflicts between such beliefs and the benefits of good sanitation. This is often also part of sanitation promotion and 
marketing (section 5.4).
3.4.1	
Wash or wipe? Sit or squat?
All peoples in the world can be divided into two categories – twice: people are either ‘washers’ or ‘wipers’ and either 
‘sitters’ or ‘squatters’. Washers use water, and wipers use paper or other material, for anal cleansing. Sitters prefer to sit 
on a pedestal-seat unit whilst defecating and in case of women also whilst urinating, whereas squatters prefer to squat 
over a squat pan. Good physiological arguments can be made for squatting (better bowel evacuation), but really life is 
too short: if people are sitters give them pedestal-seat units, anf if they are squatters give them squat pans (Figure 3.15).

School sanitation
All schools should have separate sanitation facilities for girls and boys (Figure 3.16) – at present far too many schools do 
not have any sanitation facility.[33-35] If schools do not have separate facilities for girls and boys (or no facilities at all), then 
adolescent girls tend not to go to school when they are menstruating, so they lose out of ~25% of their education.[36,37] 
In a study of women of reproductive age (15–44 years) in 175 developing countries, the number of years of schooling 
was found to have increased from an average of 2.2 in 1970 to 7.2 in 2009; more importantly during this 40-year period 
there were 8.2 million fewer deaths in children under 5 and around half this number could be attributed to the increased 
educational attainment in women of child-bearing age.[38] Educated women are healthier, wealthier (and thus more likely 
to have adequate sanitation – Figure 1.1), more likely to have children at a later age and fewer of them, less likely to die in 
childbirth, and more likely to send their children to school; furthermore their children live longer and healthier lives.[39] 
Thus educating girls is extremely important for socio-economic development.[40,41] It is also integral to the MDGs: Goal 
2 is to ‘Achieve Universal Primary Education’, with the specific target to ‘ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys 
and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling’; and Goal 3 is to ‘Promote Gender Equality 
and Empower Women’, with the target to ‘eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 
2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015’.[42] Schools therefore have to be girl-friendly and, from a sanitation 
perspective, this means separate facilities for boys and girls.

3.6	
Ecological sanitation
We each excrete nearly enough nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) to fertilize all the basic carbohydrate 
(potato, maize, rice, soya, etc) we consume. As the price of artificial fertilisers rises there is renewed interest in the potential 
to capture nutrients (and energy) from human waste. This already occurs in some of the sanitation systems described 
above (from the simple Arborloo, to the reuse of treated wastewater collected in simplified sewer networks). The idea is 
often summarised by the phrase ‘closing the loop’ – encompassing the idea that human waste and food production are so 
closely linked that nutrients should be retained as ‘close to the point of production’ as possible.[43]

Sanitation and Water Supply in Low-income Countries

Sanitation Systems
Some commentators also note that, since the bulk of the nutrient content is in the urine fraction of human excreta, we 
should keep the various waste streams [yellow water (urine), brown water (faeces + any flush water), and grey water (non-
toilet wastewater)] separate to facilitate this and in particular to conserve phosphorus which is in short supply globally. 
There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach, which is very widely advocated,[e.g., 44] and commonly associated 
with the term ‘EcoSan’. However EcoSan toilets, which require diversion of urine at the point of production, remain an 
expensive option in many cases. They are usually too expensive for the rural or urban poor − who are not responsible for 
the global P crisis and who should not, in fairness, be required to have an expensive sanitation solution to partly solve 
it.[45] Having said that, eThekwini latrines (section 3.2.1) can be simply modified to act as EcoSan toilets. The key factor is 
to understand whether there is an opportunity to reuse the product; if users want to be able to reuse the waste (directly 
or through resale) and are willing to use the toilets appropriately, ecological toilets can work well.
In high-density urban areas where there is not the space for EcoSan toilets the “loop can be closed” by collecting all the 
wastewater streams together (i.e., as normal domestic wastewater) in a simplified sewerage network. Treatment can be 
provided in decentralized wastewater treatment plants − i.e., one treatment plant per catchment area which, if designed 
properly, can recover the energy in the wastewater (as biogas) as well as the NPK it contains so that it can be safely used 
for crop irrigation.[46]

Chapter 3: Key Messages
1.	 Open defecation needs to eliminated through interventions like Community-led Total Sanitation 
(CLTS). In the move from open defecation to fixed-place defecation, the ‘fixed place’ must be at least 
an improved sanitation facility to ensure health gains. 
2.	 In rural areas Arborloos, single-pit VIP latrines and single-pit pour-flush toilets are generally suitable.
3.	 In small towns and large villages eThekwini latrines, alternating twin-pit pour-flush toilets and biogas 
toilets can also be used.
4.	 In high-density low-income urban/periurban areas simplified sewerage is cheaper than on-
site sanitation systems. In areas subject to regular flooding low-cost combined sewerage should 
be installed. In slums areas, if the cheapest household-level sanitation option is unaffordable, 
community-managed sanitation blocks are suitable.
5.	 School sanitation is very important, especially to keep teenage girls at school. Separate facilities for 
girls and boys should be provided at all schools.

Water Supply Systems
4	 Water Supply Systems
Water is vitally important. People need water to survive. Water is needed for many different purposes: drinking, cooking, 
washing hands and cleaning the body, washing clothes, cleaning cooking utensils, cleaning the house, watering animals, 
irrigating the garden and commercial activities. In low-income communities, particularly in rural areas, different sources 
of water may be used for different purposes and at different times of the year as water resource availability varies with 
the seasons. All too often poverty and sheer necessity cause people to use supplies that are not fit to drink and give an 
unreliable or inadequate discharge. In this chapter we are concerned with how to improve these sources. 
4.1	
Rural Areas
4.1.1	
Water Quantity
The quantity of water that people need and the amount that they will actually use will depend upon its availability and 
what it is used for. There are many factors that influence this including;
• 
whether water is easy to access and transport (the distance to the source and the time spent queuing will 
affect the volume used); 
• 
the quality of the water (if the water is perceived to be of low quality then people will use less of it); 
• 
local customs (some people prefer to bathe under running water or using a bucket and pour water over 
themselves – this uses a lot more water than those who use a bowl);
• 
the socio-economic status of the users (those with a high standard of living may take more baths and use 
flushing toilets that use high volumes of water); and 
• 
whether or not people pay for the water (if there is a charge for using the water then this may reduce the 
amount that they use if they are charged by the volume used).
Water use data are frequently expressed in litres per person per day (lpd) although a large amount of water is shared 
between all the members of the household for cooking and cleaning. Typical measures of per capita consumption are 
useful however for estimating household and therefore community demand. Table 4.1 gives typical figures for water use by 
people at home, by livestock and by institutions. These figures are only estimates and, wherever possible when calculating 
the amount of water required by a community, it is best to obtain local information about water use and to study water 
consumption in neighbouring communities where the water supply has already been improved.

Water Supply Systems
In conventional water supply schemes and those in urban areas it is not normally necessary to include water for livestock 
but in rural areas it is common for households to keep animals around the house. Therefore, an allowance must be made 
for animal watering, particularly during the dry season. Similarly, in rural areas (and where space allows in urban areas) 
irrigation of kitchen gardens close to the home is very common and can consume large volumes of water. Information 
on local farming practices are the best source for estimating how much to allow for in a design. The amount of water 
needed by institutions in the community should be added to the amount needed by the households, it should not be 
assumed that it can be deducted from the home use. Water use by local industries and commercial enterprises will also 
need to be considered and added to the demand estimate. In addition, allowance must be made for predicted changes in 
population; estimated changes in development (e.g. new houses, schools and other institutions); and for water lost both 
at water points and during supply – this is known as wasted or unaccounted for water (UFW). UFW can range up to 
50% depending on the age of the scheme and how well it is maintained. It is reasonable to include an additional 20% for 
wastage and losses at the design stage.
4.1.2	
Levels of Rural Water Supply Service
In low-income countries water is often carried home from a water source in containers by hand or using animals – a tiring 
and lengthy but very necessary activity – and the amount of water collected is greatly affected by the distance from the 
water source to the home. It is often assumed that a good standard of personal and domestic hygiene can be achieved by 
supplying at least 40 litres per person per day (l/p/d). However, studies in Africa (see Figure 4.2) have shown that this 
amount of water will rarely be carried home from a water source because of the amount of time it takes to collect this 
volume of water for each member of a family. The amount of water collected remains fairly constant (at around 15 l/p/d) 
when the return journey takes between about three and 30 minutes [4]. Higher rates of consumption usually only start 
when water is supplied in the house or yard.

Water Supply Systems
Figure 4.2: Water quantity used and time taken to collect water [4]
It is more likely that supplying 40 l/p/d can be achieved by a single water point or tap in a house or yard and that a 
communal water point (a well or a handpump) will provide less (because of the round-trip walking involved). Table 4.2 
shows that a communal water point will generally provide from 5 to 25 l/p/d (average consumption) depending on the 
distance from the house to the source. Providing more taps in the house will allow consumption to increase above 40l/p/d 
– assuming that the source can meet the demands of the community.[5] Thus the level of service provided (household taps 
versus communal supplies) has a profound effect on usage patterns in the home and therefore on health outcomes. The 
World Health Organisation recognizes this fact and has categorized water supplies into four service levels according to 
the associated level of health concern (see Table 4.2).

The objective is thus to provide water as close to the home as possible to ensure adequate consumption. If a source has a 
low but constant yield water storage can be used to improve availability, which will in turn allow and encourage greater 
water use. A reservoir built at the source, and either connected to a piped water distribution system or provided with a 
tap (or taps), will allow users to draw sufficient water for their daily needs. 
Alternatively, water can be stored at home. This is particularly useful when a source is unreliable as it maintains (and 
sometimes improves) availability. This might be during the dry season when a source has run dry or if access to a source 
becomes limited by seasonal weather conditions or physical constraints. 
Local clay pots and jars, plastic jerry cans as well as larger ferrocement, plastic or fibre-glass tanks all make excellent 
storage containers (see Figure 4.1). A small opening or tap (to prevent people from dipping water out) and a tight fitting 
lid (to keep animals, insects and contaminated material out) are important characteristics. An additional advantage of 
storing water is that the water quality improves over time. If water is stored for one day over 50 per cent of the bacteria 
will die. Suspended solids, which can contain pathogens, will often settle out during storage. By using a tap positioned 
above the settled material or by pouring the clear water out carefully, the settled solids can be separated from the water.[7]

Figure 4.1 Typical storage containers include locally-manufactured clay and ceramic vessels and more modern plastic and ferro-cement 
alternatives.
As a rule, the less reliable the supply the greater the volume of storage required. For a household, where the source is 
considered to be reliable throughout the year, a storage capacity equivalent to the amount of water consumed in one or 
two days is considered adequate. For a less reliable source a larger volume should be stored.
4.1.3	
Water Quality
In the ideal world drinking water should be: [5]
• 
free from pathogenic (disease causing) organisms;
• 
contain no compounds that have an adverse effect (acute or in the long-term) on health;
• 
fairly clear (i.e., low turbidity, little colour); 
• 
not taste salty or contain compounds that cause an offensive taste or smell; and
• 
not cause corrosion or encrustation of the water supply system, nor staining clothes washed in it.

Water Supply Systems
Extensive research has enabled the production of tables that specify selected water quality parameters and their limits. These 
are based on evidence linking use of water of a particular quality with likely health outcomes. Until recently they formed 
the basis of international standards for water quality. These tables give the highest desirable and maximum permissible 
level for a range of chemicals and compounds. See the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality published by WHO (2011). 
[7] However, more recently, it has been recognized that the blanket application of standards may be inappropriate, leading 
to over-designed and over-costly systems. In view of the urgent need to increase access to basic and intermediate supplies 
of water (see Table 4.2) the World Health Organisation now recognizes the need for a more flexible approach. It now 
recommends the development of Water Safety Plans. In the words of the latest edition of the guidelines:
“The most effective means of consistently ensuring the safety of a drinking-water supply is through the use of a 
comprehensive risk assessment and risk management approach that encompasses all steps in water supply from catchment 
to consumer. In these Guidelines, such approaches are termed water safety plans (WSPs). The WSP approach has been 
developed to organize and systematize a long history of management practices applied to drinking-water and to ensure 
the applicability of these practices to the management of drinking-water quality. It draws on many of the principles and 
concepts from other risk management approaches…” [7]
The use of water safety planning allows for a progressive approach to improving water quality. Ideally, a community will 
have a convenient, safe, reliable source of good quality water but in many situations this is not possible. Often people are 
forced to manage with a source that may be far away from their homes, difficult to access, unreliable and supplies either 
very little water or water of poor quality and frequently both. The new WHO approach allows for a pragmatic assessment 
of the main risks to health, and the selection of a best-fit solution.
Chapter 2 describes the water- and excreta-related diseases (Water and excreta related diseases) and how poor personal 
hygiene favours disease transmission. It also highlights the large number of water-washed diseases that can be prevented 
both by washing hands and by washing body and clothes. In many cases an increase in water quantity may be more 
critical to health than improved quality. 
Having said that, it is of course important to understand the context in which a new water supply scheme is being built 
or improved. A baseline study and sanitary survey will reveal important information about the frequency and severity of 
Water and excreta related diseases as well as the degree of access to- and use of- water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. 
For instance, where faecal-oral infections are common and sanitation, personal hygiene and food hygiene are considered 
adequate then the role of drinking water in the transmission of faecal–oral infections may well be significant. 
Options for improving the quality of water at source include filtration and chlorination. Both have cost and management 
implications however. In addition, there is growing evidence that water which is pathogen-free at source may become 
contaminated during transportation and storage in the house [8]. A recent systematic review of good quality studies even 
suggested that treatment of water in the home (known as Point-of-Use or POU treatment) may be up to twice as effective 
at reducing diarrhea than improving water quality at the source[9].

At the household level the main options for water treatment include chlorination (for which various proprietary systems 
are available), thermal or solar disinfection, filtration (also usually using proprietary systems) and combination flocculation 
and disinfection systems. Solar disinfection has been shown to be highly effective at removing pathogens and can be 
achieved using the simple ‘SODIS’ technology. In this system low-turbidity water is placed in clear plastic bottles in full 
sunshine for a period of 6-48 hours. Discarded PET drinking water bottles are ideal and they can usually be placed on 
the roof of the house to ensure good exposure to sunlight [10]. 
As well as pathogens, water may exhibit poor quality in terms of chemical contaminants. High levels of arsenic, fluoride 
and salts can all cause serious health problems and need to be addressed. These are usually more challenging and the 
most cost-effective treatments tend to be at source rather than household level treatment options.

Water Sources
Three types of water sources are used in rural areas[11]: 
• 
rainwater, 
• 
groundwater and 
• 
surface water.

Rainwater collection
Rainwater is a valuable source of water and, when properly collected and stored, it will usually be of good quality. It can 
be collected using a ground catchment area or from house roofs. The quality of the water collected will be affected by the 
presence of contaminants on the catchment area – the tiled roofs or the ground surface. Therefore, it is important that the 
catchment area and any gutters and channels which collect and conveys the water, are kept as clean as possible. The first 
few minutes of rainfall are best discarded to avoid collecting unwanted material like dust, debris or bird droppings. The 
stored rainwater can be used to supplement other, possibly inadequate, domestic water sources and also for irrigation but 
since rainwater is seasonal it is not usually appropriate as the only source of water. The volume of storage is dependent 
upon making a best possible estimate of the amount of rainwater expected and the size of the catchment area. It is also 
helpful to know the number of ‘dry’ days when there will be no rainfall and what the daily water demand will be during 
this time (Figure 4.2). 
Figure 4.2: Rainwater harvesting from rooftops in Chennai India [12] and Kenya [13] A variety of materials can be used to store the collected water. 
Plastic vessels are often available in the local market and are light to transport and generally fairly cheap. Where these are not available, in-situ 
construction using light-weight ferro-cement is a good alternative. Underground tanks may be preferred in some locations due to greater 
storage capacity and the fact that water supplies tend to remain cooler.

Surface water
Surface water is often the easiest water source to access; a significant percentage of unimproved water sources are simply 
unprotected streams, ponds or lakes from which communities collect water. However, because of this they are easily polluted 
and very prone to faecal contamination. They are also affected by seasonal variations in turbidity (‘muddiness’) and flow. 
Variations in turbidity hinder effective treatment processes while variations in flow make it difficult to locate and design 
appropriate abstraction systems (gravity intakes or pumps to lift the water mechanically). Surface water can be screened to 
remove larger solids (leaves, pieces of wood) and filtered to remove suspended solids and to reduce or eliminate bacteria 
and other pathogens, but these systems all need to be appropriately sized and designed. Usually water from lakes or 
rivers must be pumped up to the community. The alternative option is to raise the water level in a river through a dam or 
barrage. Often surface water schemes are only cost-effective if the intake structures are sized to produce large volumes of 
bulk water supplies to be shared between a number of communities. These multi-village schemes tend to be much more 
complex than other rural water supply systems and more sophisticated management arrangements are needed than for 
most other options. 
Where surface water is the only option then care is needed to minimize pollution risks – usually by siting intake structures 
well upstream of human habitation and agriculture and by providing appropriate treatment. 
Groundwater 
Except in areas suffering from specific chemical contamination issues (arsenic, fluoride etc) groundwater is usually of better 
quality than surface water; feacal contamination is nearly always a much smaller issue than for surface water sources. It 
is effectively surface water that has sunk into the ground where it can remain for a long time in a water bearing strata (an 
aquifer). Groundwater may be obtained from springs, hand-dug wells or boreholes (also known as tubewells):
Protected springs 
As groundwater reaches the surface, the risk of pollution increases either from natural sources or through human and 
animal action. Spring sources, which are naturally clean and safe, therefore need to be properly designed, built and 
maintained to protect the water from contamination. The spring protection work should also improve accessibility of the 
water for users and, if possible, increase the water flow (in order to increase the water availability). 
Simple protection measures include fencing off or erecting a wall around the spring, building a headwall and a drainage 
system to protect the spring from erosion and steps or a ramp so that users can access the source easily. Use of the spring 
will need to be managed and pit latrines and animal pens should not be sited ‘upstream’ of the spring location (Figure 4.3).

Protected hand-dug wells
Traditional unprotected wells or water holes are usually of poor design. As a result, they contain water polluted with faecal 
pathogens and are prone to running dry during the dry season. Similar to the spring protection measures mentioned 
above these problems can be eliminated by some simple improvements for instance by;
• 
Moving latrines and animal pens away from it (at least 25 m);

• 
Deepening the well so that it reaches the groundwater during the dry season;
• 
Lining the well to stop it collapsing (the bottom is left unlined so that water can get in);
• 
Providing a parapet wall around the well-head and a cover so that people and animals cannot get in;
• 
Laying a hard-standing around the well-head which drains waste water away from where people stand; and 
• 
Installing a lifting mechanism that prevents the vessel and rope from being contaminated (e.g., by being left 
on the ground). A windlass and bucket are suitable or a handpump. 
Once these improvements are in place, and the facility is looked after and used appropriately by the community, the water 
supply will be safe and the water will generally be of average to good quality.
Boreholes
A hand- or machine-drilled borehole will usually produce good quality water. Instead of a large diameter well a small 
diameter borehole is drilled and a handpump or motorized pump installed to withdraw water. Similar design considerations 
regarding pollution, contamination and use, which were made for springs and hand-dug wells, apply for boreholes as well; 
the hole must be sealed and lined and a plinth with adequate drainage should be provided at the well-head. Although 
boreholes will only work where a suitable aquifer is found they do have significant advantages compared to hand-dug 
wells, namely:
• 
Greater depths are usually possible than with hand-dug wells;
• 
Mechanised drilling rigs can usually deal with any type of rock stratum;
• 
They are quicker to dig than a hand-dug well;
• 
The small diameter hole when sealed properly completely prevents pollution; and 
• 
They are fitted with either a narrow bucket or handpump which also prevents contamination by users.
However, they do have some disadvantages:
• 
The material cost is higher – the casing, screens, pipes and handpumps need to be of sufficient quality and 
may not be available locally.
• 
A higher level of technical support is required during construction than with hand-dug wells; and 
• 
Maintenance of a handpump or narrow bucket pump is more complicated than a bucket and windlass 
system and replacement parts may again be expensive and difficult to source.
Table 4.3 shows a comparison of the capital and running costs of the different rural water sources.The cost of rainwater 
catchment is comparatively low. The capital cost will increase with the volume of storage tank that is required while running 
costs are very minimal. In contrast both the capital and running costs are high for surface water sources, especially when 
relatively complex intake designs have to be built and both treatment and pumping to supply are required as well.

Where a community can build and run an improved hand-dug well by themselves this will be the lowest cost groundwater 
option. A protected spring is also cheap to establish and once installed the running costs will be minimal. If the villagers 
travel to the spring to collect water and hand-carry it back to their houses the capital cost will be low; if however, long 
lengths of supply pipes have to be laid to the community then the capital costs will rise (perhaps to a ‘medium’ level) 
and there will be additional running costs to repair breakages and leakage. The cost of drilling and lining a borehole and 
the need for maintenance of the pump means that both the capital and running costs of boreholes are regarded as being 
‘medium’ level.

Urban areas
As shown in Figure 3.7, the world is urbanizing rapidly and most population growth in the next few decades will be in 
urban areas in developing countries – this population is expected to increase from 2,500 million, its 2009 value, to 3,520 
million by 2025 and to 5,190 million by 2050.[15]

Water Supply Systems
In 2008 94% of the urban population in developing countries, which then numbered 2,400 million people, had ‘improved’ 
water supplies (Table 1.1) and 73% had household connections to piped supplies.[16] Thus most of those without a piped 
supply had an ‘improved’ supply but, as shown in Figure 1.3, this does not necessarily mean they had an ‘adequate’ supply. 
The majority of these people would have been poor or very poor, so it is very unlikely that many of them would have 
had an adequate water supply.
4.2.1	
Levels of urban water-supply service
There are four levels of water-supply service in urban areas:
0.	 Hand-carried non-piped supplies – people collect water in containers from unprotected and commonly 
polluted sources such as springs and streams/rivers,
1.	 Hand-carried piped supplies – people collect water in containers from public ‘standpipes’ (public taps) or 
they purchase water by the container-full from water kiosks, water vendors or water tankers; 
2.	 Yard-tap piped supplies – one tap per household, and
3.	 Multiple-tap in-house piped supplies (this is generally only an option for the non-poor).
Clearly Level 0 represents a wholly inadequate supply. The problem with Level 1 supplies is that, if the water is piped water 
obtained from water kiosks and water vendors, then the water is very expensive – this is what Professor John Briscoe (now 
of Harvard University) had to say in a radio interview in 2003 when he was the senior water adviser at the World Bank:[17]

Water Supply Systems
“You can go to virtually any city in the developing world, and you’ll find a whole industry of people selling water 
out of trucks, water vendors who are selling water at 10 times the rate that you and I pay for water in Washington, 
DC, to people whose income is less than a dollar a day. Carrying water around on trucks and on people’s shoulders 
is a very, very inefficient way to provide the service. So you could go in and you could provide service to people, to 
poor people, at a fraction of what they’re now paying, and they’ll pay the full cost of that service.”
In fact poor people with a Level 1 piped supply pay many times more than the non-poor in the same city who have a 
Level 3 supply – for example, in Asian cities the poor often pay USD 20 per month for 6 m³ of water, whereas the rich 
only pay USD 4 per month for 30 m³ of water – so the poor are paying 25 times more per m3 of water than the rich and 
for a much worse service.[18] Clearly this cannot be right.
Thus the biggest challenge in increasing access to adequate piped water supplies in low-income urban areas, including 
slums, is to get urban water agencies (which may be a public agency – part of the town/city council or a state/provincial 
water supply authority/company – or a private company operating the supply for a public agency) to realise that they can 
do this by extending urban piped water supplies into these poor areas by working with poor communities to do this in 
an affordable way (see section 4.2.2). 
4.2.2	
The New Paradigm for urban water supplies
To meet universal water supply and sanitation coverage in low-income and often high-density urban areas sooner rather 
than later requires a totally new approach − a ‘New Paradigm’, which can be very simply stated as follows:[19]
The reason for this is extremely simple: reduced costs. Table 4.3 shows the cost advantages of ‘condominial’ water supplies 
in the mining town of Parauapebas in the state of Pará in north Brazil.[23] The supply was for 250 litres per person per day 
from multiple-tap in-house connections with an initial connection rate of 90 percent. The conventional supply was for 
individual household connections and the condominial supply for one connection per condominium (i.e., per group of 
households or housing block − Figure 4.4). The cost per connection for the condominial supply was roughly one quarter 
of that for the conventional supply.

Figure 4.4: Condominial water supply: there is only one connection (•) per housing block/cooperative leading to communal standpipes, 
individual yard taps or, for non-poor cooperatives, multiple-tap in-house supplies.
José Carlos Melo, who developed the condominial system in Brazil, describes Parauapebas as presenting “a rare example of 
applying the condominial model to the water sector and illustrates the potential operational advantages that condominial 
designs bring to water systems. Moreover, the city was able to mobilize large-scale community participation in the 
construction of the network. The result was the very rapid expansion of water coverage at a fraction of the cost of a 
conventional system.”[20]
The high level of water supply service adopted in Parauapebas is not, of course, applicable to poor urban communities 
in developing countries, but the condominial concept is. It can be adapted for poor urban communities very simply as 
follows: each community forms a cooperative (or ‘condominium’) and chooses the level of water supply service that it is 
willing and able to pay for. Thus, in any one urban situation, there would be a mix of:
• 
standpipe cooperatives: groups of households served by community-managed standpipes (one or two per 
cooperative; the supply is not metered); the member households would pay a nominal tariff − for example, 
1−2% of the local minimum wage, [standpipes are often thought to be a very inferior level of water,
• 
yard-tap cooperatives: groups of households served by household-level yard taps; the supply would be 
unmetered and each member household would pay a minimum tariff of, say, 5% of the local minimum 
wage; and
• 
multiple-tap in-house cooperatives: groups of non-poor households each with a multiple-tap in-house 
supply; the supply to the cooperative would be metered and charged for on the standard domestic tariff.

Water Supply Systems
The public supply is to a single point for each cooperative (or housing block) and the member-households are responsible 
for all in-block pipework and connections (normally they would engage a local contractor to do this), although for 
standpipe cooperatives the water supply agency may choose to install the standpipes itself as a ‘social’ service to the poor 
and the very poor. The water supply authority bills the cooperative, not individual member-households, and therefore 
the cooperative is responsible for collecting each member-household’s contribution every month and paying the water 
bills. If the water-supply agency really is pro-poor then it should consider spreading the annual payment from standpipe 
and yard-tap cooperatives over 10 months, rather than 12, so that no charge is payable in the months of the major local 
festival and the start of the school year when households have significant additional expenditure. 
Standpipes are often thought to be a very inferior water-supply service level. This is commonly true when they are installed 
as a free so-called ‘social service’ by the local water-supply agency at a rate of one per many hundreds of people and 
without proper maintenance,[21] but it is not true when − as in a well designed standpipe-cooperative programme – a few 
standpipes serve a relatively small group of households. Properly managed standpipes are, without doubt, an excellent 
means of getting piped water to the urban poor.[22-23]
If the sanitation option in a low-income high-density area is a community-managed sanitation block (section 3.3.4) – 
which has its own piped water-supply connection − then there is in effect already a functioning water-and-sanitation 
cooperative which can extend its piped supply to private standpipes within its area as it sees fit for the greater convenience 
of its member-households.

Water Supply Systems
If the water-supply agency, backed by the town/city council, decides that all urban communities in that town/city should 
receive condominial supplies and if some non-poor communities refuse to participate, they should pay significantly more 
for their water. However, many non-poor urban communities are already paying condominial charges (for example, 
residents of apartments in high-rise blocks pay for common services such as the cleaning and lighting of communal areas, 
the operation of elevators, and garden and swimming pool maintenance), so one extra condominial payment should not 
be a real problem.
An alternative model which has met with some success in Africa and some parts of Latin America and Asia is the sale 
of water at a discounted bulk tariff to a third-party private provider (often a community-based entrepreneur) who then 
on-sells the water to local households. The third-party provider has the option of selling water at a fixed point (usually a 
water kiosk) or installing a network and selling water to individual households usually through a metered connection. This 
model works well for large communities where the formation of condominial cooperatives is more challenging. Examples 
include regulated kiosks in Maputo, Mozambique, and community-based water and sanitation entrepreneurs operating 
in Nairobi Kenya. [24] Careful regulation is needed to ensure that the interests of poor customers are protected and that 
prices do not rise [25,26]. The affordability, and therefore the success of the model relies on the main water service provider 
being willing to forego the full domestic tariff rates when selling water to third-party providers. Usually this should be an 
attractive option, given that the alternative is often illegal tampering with pipelines and theft of water. 
4.2.3	
Expected health improvements
Getting piped water into low-income urban areas by a well designed programme of either standpipes or yard taps (as in 
standpipe and yard-tap cooperatives) is a really good way to improve the health of the residents of these areas – provided, 
of course, adequate sanitation (section 3.3) is in place as well. For example, a cost-effectiveness analysis done in Uganda 
showed that, for a poor urban town, only in-house piped water supplies significantly impacted diarrhoea prevalence, 
although the provision of community standpipes resulted in the largest reduction in the burden of diarrhoeal disease at 
the lowest cost.[27] More generally, the health benefits of water supplies follow a ‘threshold-saturation’ pattern:[28] 
• 
in extremely poor communities water supply improvements have little, if any, effect on health (sufficient 
quantities of more nutritious food, for example, are likely to have a much greater effect); 
• 
as communities begin to develop (i.e., once they have reached the ‘threshold’) water supply improvements 
start to produce health benefits; and 
• 
when communities are quite well developed (i.e., they are past the ‘saturation’ point) water supply 
improvements do not bring any further health benefits.
Recent work in Brazil has found that the impact of water supply improvements on reducing infant mortality rates follows 
this threshold-saturation pattern very closely, and that “from the perspective of health outcomes, new piped water resources 
should be targeted to the most disadvantaged communities”.[29]

Water Supply Systems
Chapter 4: Key Messages
1.	 Improving access to water greatly increases the amount that a person will use and this will have a greater 
benefit on their health than improving only the quality of their existing supply source. 
2.	 Wherever possible groundwater should be the preferred source for a rural water supply scheme. Surface 
water sources are much more likely to be polluted and are more unreliable, on account of being more 
subject to seasonal variations in flow.
3.	 Rainwater can be a valuable subsidiary water source and can be used to supplement a possibly inadequate 
or unreliable primary supply source.
4.	 In urban areas the poor usually pay significantly more than the rich for very poor levels of water supply 
service
5.	 There is an urgent need for a new paradigm of urban water supply service delivery whereby service 
providers sell water to groups of consumers organised either through cooperative groups or as clients of 
third-party service providers.
6.	 The costs of condominial water supplies are significantly lower than the costs of conventional supplies and 
the health gains are significant when compared to existing unregulated supplies.

Delivering adequate water and sanitation services is not simply a matter of building infrastructure. As we have already 
seen, water supply, sanitation and handwashing are all important in the management of water- and excreta-related diseases. 
Sanitation and handwashing in particular usually require significant changes in behaviour to be effective (for example 
shifting habits from defecating in the open to using a latrine, or washing hands with soap at important times). What is 
more, sanitation and water services need to be kept running over many years and require constant inputs to ensure that 
this happens. In rural areas communities themselves are usually important in ensuring that this happens whilst in urban 
areas, effective city-wide management is required. Furthermore, in urban areas community systems need to be linked to 
city-wide services. Finally both sanitation and water supply have strong gender and power dimensions; interventions may 
improve equity but can also inadvertently result in entrenching the position of the strongest elements in society to the 
detriment of the less powerful. The provision of water and sanitation is thus a much larger and more complex challenge 
than it may first appear.

Getting Started - Understanding where the constraints lie
Designing a water supply, sanitation and hygiene programme is about more than just construction. The exact scope of 
a programme is highly dependent on the local circumstances. The nature of the technical problem to be solved, along 
with social and economic characteristics of target communities all play a part in determining the optimum intervention. 
The first step in good programming is to gain an accurate picture of the current situation. This can be done through a 
combination of reviewing existing documentation, physical inspections and interactions with householders and other 
local stakeholders. Depending on the stage, scale and complexity of the planned intervention this may take a few days 
or many months, but the broad areas for a typical assessment will usually be similar. An indicative checklist is shown in 
Table 5.1 but other things could be added to this list. 
A crucial tool is a good map of the area. These days, good maps can usually be obtained or created from web-based 
resources such as Google Maps combined with locally available technical maps and drawings. This type of mapping should 
always be checked against a visual inspection of the area.

Participatory Planning Tools
Much of the information required may need to be obtained through interactions with community members. Care is 
needed to ensure that information gathered from the community is representative and meaningful. Brief visits and quick 
discussions with people met casually in the market place are usually insufficient to glean an accurate picture of community 
dynamics and experiences. A group of techniques known as Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) form the backbone of 
most of the accepted techniques for community engagement. [1]
PRA is primarily concerned with empowering communities to be part of the process of information gathering (compared 
to earlier techniques which tended to focus on ‘extracting’ information.) PRA techniques are designed to be extremely 
inclusive and take into account the fact that many participants may be unable to read or write (so they make use of 
pictures, mapping and counting using locally-available materials such as stones or sticks). In general, these approaches 
are useful for encouraging the involvement of women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities who in some 
cultures may be reluctant or unable to express their views. Participatory tools in PRA have been developed into water 
and sanitation-specific tools such as:
• 
Water resource and use-mapping;
• 
Wealth/access mapping; 
• 
Card sorting (usually using pictures of ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ situations);
• 
Pocket voting (where community members can ‘vote’ for the most urgently-needed ;interventions); and
• 
Causal linkage diagramming.
Specific methodologies exist which can be used as part of the planning process for water supplies and sanitation (see Figure 
5.1). These include SARAR (Self-esteem, Associative Strengths, Resourcefulness, Action-planning and Responsibility) and 
MPA (the Methodology for Participatory Assessments).[2,3,4]

Inducing Behaviour Change and Promoting Hygiene
As we have seen changing key hygiene behaviours can often be an essential element in achieving health gains in poor 
communities. Most of the evidence suggests that health is rarely the driver for changes in hygiene behaviours; pride, status, 
convenience and modernity are usually seen as stronger reasons to change behaviours. [5] Older approaches which largely 
relied on instruction about the health risks of not practising safe hygiene have now largely been replaced by approaches 
which build on people’s own motivations and interests. 
Hygiene promotion approaches can broadly be split into two categories – those which aim to change community-wide 
hygiene behaviours in the broadest sense and those which target one specific behaviour. 
In the first group are a family of approaches that aim to empower community members to solve their own hygiene (and 
often sanitation) challenges. The oldest of these is called Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST).
[6] PHAST encourages the participation of individuals in a group process of: 
• 
Problem identification;
• 
Problem analysis;
• 
Planning for solutions;
• 
Selecting options;
• 
Planning new facilities;
• 
Planning for Monitoring and Evaluation; and
• 
Participatory evaluation.
Other techniques use a similar programme cycle but are less formulaic. In Zimbabwe, Community Health Clubs help to 
promote a ‘culture of health’ by bringing together groups from within the community who meet regularly to hold facilitated 
discussions about key hygiene and health issues. Dr Juliet Waterkeyn, who developed the CHC concept in Zimbabwe, 
describes the community learning process as follows:[7] 
“Each weekly meeting of health club members focused on one topic, debating common problems, prompted by 
the participatory PHAST activities. Through repeated interaction a strong and informed leadership, elected by the 
members, emerged in most clubs before any implementation (such as latrine construction) took place. All health clubs 
had executive committees, constitutions and annual elections. Application of knowledge gained was emphasised and 
‘homework’ was agreed at every session with members pledging small home improvements and behaviour changes 
to be effected by the following week. These changes included a cover for the drinking water, a ladle to take water, 
the construction of a garbage pit, a pot drying-rack and a handwashing facility. Home visits between members were 
arranged to monitor one another’s progress. Each club produced its own health songs which were sung at each session 
and dramas depicting local health issues were developed for other clubs, visitors and for the schools. Health slogans 
punctuated each session, reinforcing key messages and providing resolve and focus to the group in a traditional 
manner. To complete the course of 20 sessions took between 6 and 8 months of weekly attendance.”

CHCs have been extremely successful in sanitation promotion and latrine construction (the latrines were VIP latrines 
– see section 3.1.3): for example, in Zimbabwe sanitation coverage was 2% in a district not having CHCs but 43% in a 
CHC project area, with the balance of 57% practising ‘cat sanitation’ (i.e., digging a small hole before defecation and then 
covering the faeces afterwards – as a cat does).
CHCs are now used in many countries in Africa and Asia.[8,9,10] A combination of specialist information, facilitated problem 
solving and peer pressure seems to be effective in changing household and personal behaviours.[11]
Schools are also an important locus for changing hygiene behaviours. Many observers note the effectiveness of children 
as ‘agents of change’ in the family. WASH in Schools, focusing both on promoting behaviour change through teaching 
but also by demonstrating the benefits in a school which has good sanitation and hygiene facilities, has become a popular 
element in many water, sanitation and hygiene programmes and its effectiveness seems to be quite high [12,13]. In one 
evaluation classes where more girls washed their hands and used the toilet tended to have better attendance. Households 
in communities with a WASH in Schools programme appeared to be twice as likely to have soap in toilets at home as 
control communities [14]. 
In addition to these community-based approaches, marketing approaches have been growing in popularity in recent 
years. These tend to use private-sector marketing techniques to promote one specific behaviour (typically handwashing 
with soap or point-of-use water treatment). Marketing tends to use a blend of mass media, and face-to-face methods and 
is tailored to the specific cultural context in which it operates. Crucially marketing campaigns are based on formative 
research to identify critical drivers for behaviour change.

Creating Sanitation Markets
Throughout much of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s sanitation programmes in many countries focused on the provision 
of toilets, usually through direct implementation by government, and commonly with a large subsidy element to pay for 
costs of construction. Public-good and equity arguments have been used to justify this approach. Regrettably however, 
many of these national programmes had limited success, with a poor take up rate, evidence of poor targeting of subsidies 
and limited reach. Thus, although the case for public engagement in sanitation is compelling, new programmes have 
tended to work in alternative ways and seek to make better use of public funds. 
Generally the ‘new’ generation of approaches can be divided into two groupings: firstly those that deal with community-
wide sanitation and are based on ‘participatory’ approaches (see Section 3.1.1); and secondly those that use a social 
marketing approach to analyse and intervene in the supply and demand of goods and services.

Initially building sanitation markets was seen as primarily a matter of establishing entities (usually social enterprises and 
sometimes small private entrepreneurs) to provide sanitation goods and services. Training (both technical and business 
training) was provided and it was hoped that these small businesses would rapidly become viable and independent. 
Nowadays sanitation marketing is seen as a much more complex business. It requires the development of appropriate 
products and appropriate financial instruments which match the demand coming from communities. [15] If we think of 
sanitation and hygiene behaviours as a continuous process of change (sometimes referred to as a ‘ladder’) it becomes 
easier to understand that sanitation markets need to be robust, flexible and adaptive if they are to provide what is needed 
(Figure 5.1).
Figure 5.1 Dynamic sanitation and hygiene behaviour change[1]
Broadly sanitation marketing programmes have four steps:
• 
Formative research (to identify the behaviour change required and the likely drivers of that change);
• 
Development of a marketing strategy;
• 
Development of a communications campaign; and
• 
Implementation
Experience with sanitation marketing is growing fast (see Figure 5.2). A number of very useful online materials exist to 
help develop sanitation marketing interventions. [15]

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Management options for rural water supplies
While they vary considerably, rural communities are often remote and scattered. Many are far from the capital city and 
even remote from district administrative centres and market towns. In such communities specific arrangements must be 
made to ensure that there is adequate diesel fuel to operate pumps, or that the electricity bill or the pump operator are 
paid on time. Small repairs to channels or pipelines may be needed and from time-to-time pumps may require servicing 
or an overhaul. In mechanised schemes, if the pump fails there will be no water at all. During the late 1970s, the 1980s 
and into the 1990s much emphasis was placed on the need for Village-level Operation and Maintenance (VLOM). A 
number of handpumps were developed with the specific objective of being easy to maintain and operate by village level 
technicians (these are often referred to as VLOM handpumps). However the experience of community management has 
been mixed and recent research suggests that at significant percentage of, handpumps in Africa are non-functional despite 
decades of effort to build up community management capacity[16] (see Figure 5.1). 
Figure 5.1: Proportion of non-functional handpumps in selected countries
In addition to the simple model of village-level maintenance there are a number of more sophisticated options for 
management of rural water supplies including:
Public-sector management: Traditionally maintenance of rural water supplies has been provided by the staff of national or 
decentralised public health or public works agencies. Typically district engineers are based in a local district headquarters. 
Their salaries are paid from the general budget and they are expected to respond to requests from communities for 
assistance when their water systems break down. Funds for general maintenance and small repairs are provided through 
the normal public-sector budget.

Programming and Planning
In theory this approach has a number of advantages including the availability of skilled and trained staff with access to 
budgets. Usually it also means that the same organisation and probably the same engineers who designed the system are 
responsible for its operation. However, the reality is often different. Public sector budgets for operations are notoriously 
unreliable, particularly in remote districts. Funds may be allocated late in the financial year or not at all, and are often 
inadequate to do more than pay the engineers’ and technicians’ salaries. There is low accountability (communities have 
little influence over the performance of the engineers) and schemes which are farthest from the district office may get 
least attention. Poorly paid and working far from headquarters, the best engineers are rarely tempted to compete for these 
positions. With limited resources and few incentives to perform many district water offices do little to help communities; 
and the sight of broken pumps and damaged equipment lying unrepaired in the office yard is not uncommon. 
Community self-management: The alternative to this traditional public-sector model is the water user committee or local 
community self-management. Under this model the community usually forms a committee to run the scheme and users 
pay a small periodic fee which is kept in a general fund to cover operations and maintenance. Sometimes these funds are 
used to pay the salary of a pump operator. 
This approach has several important advantages: the users have control and can communicate problems quickly to the 
committee or the operator, accountability is higher (if the committee fails to perform everybody knows) and there should 
be sufficient funds available for regular ongoing costs. However, there are also disadvantages. The most obvious one is a 
lack of appropriate local skills which can cause particular problems when major repairs are needed. At such times funds 
may also be short (people may be unwilling or unable to build up sufficient deposits in the community bank account on 
the off chance that they will be needed later and credit may not be available locally). Committees may have limited or 
no access to overall planning information (for example regarding water resources). Finally this approach places a burden 
of responsibility and time requirements on community members; in rural communities, particularly at busy times of the 
farming year, this may be untenable. Nonetheless in some countries and some situations community self-management 
has proved highly successful. Rural Kenya has numerous community-managed schemes, some of which are extremely 
large and complex (see, for example, Box 5.1).

Box 5.1: Good practice in Community Water Supply: The Case of Murugi Mugumango[17]
This scheme was started in the 1980s when five small schemes amalgamated to form Murugi Water Project. In 1983 
Murugi merged with Mugumango Water Project to form the Murugi Mugumango Water Society. Construction of the 
Project was supported by the Canadian Hunger Foundation (CHF) who also hired a local NGO to train the committee 
and operations staff. Currently the Project serves two locations with an area of around 140 km2 through 168 km of 
main lines, 580 km of branch lines and 12 storage tanks. 
The scheme is managed by an elected management committee. The committee employs 18 staff who are supported 
when required by contractors for specialized services. So far the project has 2,883 registered members out of whom 
2,423 have individual metered connections. The project has adopted a commercial approach in its affairs and collects 
around KES 200,000 monthly against operational costs of around KES 150,000. The scheme thus appears to be financially 
viable through the tariff. An external auditor audits the scheme finances annually and the audit report is presented to 
members during the annual general meeting. In moving towards increased sustainability the scheme is embarking in 
strategic planning exercises. The scheme regularly hosts management committees and staff from other projects within 
the country as well as from outside the country who come to learn about its management systems. Such good practice 
examples provide opportunity for inter scheme learning exchanges to increase sustainability in the sector as a whole. 
Indeed the management committee has plans to the make the project a training centre for community projects in the 
region.

Programming and Planning
Semi-professional management or regional schemes: In this model a group of communities (or local government) collect 
fees and retain the services of a local circuit rider/ management company or similar to support them in running their 
water supply. 
The advantages of this grouping together is that it enables community-managed schemes to access support, skills 
and knowledge they otherwise would be unable to afford. Local communities retain some control but combine their 
‘buying power’. However, the model does have disadvantages. The transactions costs can be high (it is not always easy 
for communities to work together) and it may be hard to coordinate between them to get value for money. Information 
asymmetries may also exist resulting in private sector service providers being able to overcharge for their services. In 
some countries, private service providers may simply not be available in the market. 
5.6	
Urban Water and Sanitation Planning 
In contrast to rural areas, service delivery in urban areas is rarely under the control of local communities. Choices made at 
the local level are profoundly influenced by the city at large – water supply is dependent on bulk water supplies reaching 
the city often from far away and sanitation depends on there being somewhere to dispose of the waste; communities are 
not therefore in a position to self-supply as is often the case in remote rural areas. At the same time, many cities in the 
global south are growing rapidly (see Section 3.3.1) but have a low taxation base and limited funds. The planning of water 
supply and sanitation is often haphazard and highly influenced by ‘projects’ imposed by central government or donors. 
Systematic planning is rare, and in any case, the needs of informal settlements, peripheral growth areas and slums are 
rarely high on the political priority list. The result is often chaotic and highly unsatisfactory. Communities are often reliant 
on illegal water sources or unregulated private vendors and sanitation is most often absent. 
Urban water and sanitation is thus characterized by a split between the planning, implementation and operation of the 
‘formal’ network services (typically water networks and waterborne sewerage) serving very small parts of the planned area 
of the city and the ad hoc provision of services to most of the rest of the city, including unplanned, informal and illegal 
settlements. While a number of NGO-led and CBO-led initiatives have worked hard to develop approaches which work 
in these informal settlements, few have managed to forge a constructive dialogue with city managers. Meanwhile much 
of the planning for the formal system fails to take into account the needs, capacities and constraints of the urban poor [1]. 
Many of the most promising options for urban service provision involve the linking together of the city network to a 
series of local service providers (see for example Sections 3.3.2 and 4.2.2). In these approaches cities enter into formal 
arrangements with third-party providers (either community cooperatives or small scale independent (private) providers 
to deliver services over the ‘last mile’ to the household door. This approach is appealing to many city authorities who 
lack the manpower or skills to work in dense informal settlements. Other promising options include the formalisation 
of informal service providers such as pit-emptiers, to ensure that they provide an adequate service at a regulated price in 
return for being able to run legal businesses.

Programming and Planning
Whatever service delivery model is adopted good planning requires that local demands and needs are balanced with city-
wide interests. The International Water Association developed a useful framework for city-wide planning of sanitation 
(which could apply equally well to water supply). In the Sanitation 21 framework the incentives and interests of stakeholders 
are taken into account explicitly. This highlights very quickly the tensions which exist for example between national 
environmental regulators who are interested in preserving water quality in rivers and aquifers downstream of the city and 
inhabitants of slums who are only interested in reducing the flooding and gross contamination in their own neighbourhood.
[20]
The problem is that we don’t as yet have many good examples of cities who have successfully overcome these tensions 
in the face of rapid urbanisation and increasing informality. Often the problems of the city are so overwhelming that 
sanitation cannot gain the attention it needs. Furthermore it is the poorest who suffer most when sanitation services are not 
provided and they often have the least political power. There is no doubt that delivering sufficient safe water and adequate 
sanitation to the growing urban populations of Africa and Asia remains one of the biggest challenges of this century.

Chapter 5: Key Messages
1.	 Designing a water supply, sanitation and hygiene programme is about more than just construction. 
Community dynamics and socio-economic factors all play a vital role in determining the success or 
failure of a project or programme.
2.	 The exact scope of a programme is highly dependent on the local circumstances; the nature of the technical 
problem to be solved, along with social and economic characteristics of target communities all play a part in 
determining the optimum intervention.
3.	 Changing hygiene behaviours is an essential element in achieving health gains in many poor communities. Health 
is rarely the driver for community decision making however, people are more likely to be motivated by pride or 
ideas about ‘modernity’ or beauty to change hygiene practices.
4.	 Management plans for rural water supply systems have to be designed into the project from the start with 
appropriate financial arrangements and training to ensure that the system will be kept running.
5.	 Urban sanitation and water supply present some of the greatest challenges of the coming century and require 
significant effort and leadership to ensure that service provision at least keeps pace with urbanisation.

Economics and Financing
6	 Economics and Financing
Water supply, sanitation and hygiene are expensive interventions which require careful financial planning. Cost comprises 
both the initial investment costs and the long term costs of maintenance and operations as well as auxiliary costs such 
as education, promotion, surveillance, regulation and management. While these costs appear high, the benefits are often 
significantly higher. The engineer needs to have a basic understanding of how to calculate both costs and benefits so as 
to be able to promote a project appropriately. Finally, there is the issue of how finances are to be arranged. What sources 
of funds are available and how will money be collected and dispersed to ensure that there is sufficient cash flow to deliver 
the project or programme. 
6.1	
What does it cost?
Cost is a critical factor in determining the success of sanitation and water supply projects and programmes. While there 
is always pressure to keep costs low, it is also important to ensure that adequate levels of service are provided to secure 
health gains and ensure that the system is properly used and maintained. Trade-offs between capital costs and operational 
costs and between overall system cost and durability are also often a feature of project planning.

Several attempts have been made to assess the costs of reaching the water and sanitation MDG targets but these are 
generally contentious as they require a number of assumptions to be made – the most important of which relates to what 
level of service is to be notionally provided. When considering the cost differential between an improved spring and a 
household water connection to a multi-village scheme for example, or between a simple pit latrine and a networked sewer 
connection with treatment, these challenges become obvious. In 2004 WHO put together a set of cost estimates based 
on the best available information at the time and these are yet to be bettered. Table 6.1 shows the indicative capital cost 
estimates for three regions and a number of different service levels based on the WHO 2004 analysis.

Of course the real costs of these facilities and services are considerably higher since the operational and maintenance 
costs often dwarf the investment costs over the lifetime of the facilities. WHO went on to estimate these (as ranges) for 
the various technologies they had considered and then to calculate annualised costs for the various types of services 
(Tables 6.2 and 6.3).

We have already seen however (Figure 3.12) that such generalised estimates need to be treated with caution. They do 
little more than give an indication, but detailed cost estimates are required in every specific case for planning purposes. 
Such detailed cost estimates need to include careful assessment of the long term operation and maintenance costs as well 
as the management and establishment costs required to support a programme. Even very simple low-cost interventions 
such as CLTS often carry significant operational and management overhead. Table 6.4 shows some estimates of costs for 
CLTS from a 2008 study of three WaterAid country programmes.

The Economics of Sanitation and Water Supply
Economic benefits from water supply, sanitation and hygiene can be very high indeed. A global assessment of the benefits 
of sanitation alone estimated that the return on a $1 investment in sanitation could be as high as $9 globally [1]. A global 
initiative to calculate the losses associated with poor sanitation in countries around the world concluded for example that 
in South Asian countries losses are equivalent to some 4.5 to 6.5% of GDP. India loses just under US$54 billion per year 
due to the negative impacts of poor sanitation, mostly due to the costs associated with ill-health [3]. 
These large numbers are useful for advocacy at the national level. However at the level of the project or programme how 
can benefits for sanitation and water supply be estimated?
Benefits can in general be divided into health-related benefits and non-health related benefits. The health related benefits 
(i.e., the economic advantages to people not getting sick) can broadly be defined as[4]:
• 
Health care savings (health agencies);
• 
Health care savings (individuals);
• 
Productivity gains (working days);
• 
Productivity gains (school days);
• 
Healthy days gained (pre-school children);
• 
Time savings (convenience of supply); and
• 
Value of deaths averted.
The non-health gains from improved water and sanitation include positive impacts on gender (particularly related to 
the empowerment of women and girls), education, disability and environmental protection. However, a recent literature 
review did note that there is limited research to quantify these benefits [5].

Economics and Financing
In general benefits from health gains are the easiest to estimate, but even here there are difficulties. Economic gains 
from better health are usually largely related to an increase in productive days for economically active members of the 
household and school children. Calculating the value of these benefits is challenging however and requires both solid 
baseline information on health status (so as to be able to assess or predict marginal health gains) and information on the 
economic value of the time gained. Use of the DALY methodology (see Box 2.1) can facilitate an assessment of the value 
of both reduced sickness and deaths averted. Self reporting on illness is notoriously unreliable, so data from health posts 
and other surveillance mechanisms may be preferable. However this data is only useful if it is clear that the majority of 
sick people present themselves to the medical centre for treatment; this is far from likely in many poor and informal 
communities. If health data are available these can be converted to an economic value using the opportunity cost of 
labour for productive members of the household. If this proves difficult it is sometimes sufficient to assess likely impacts 
on diarrhoea incidence of different options for an intervention and then examine their cost effectiveness. 
For more details on the methods that can be used to assess economic benefits, readers are referred to the Economics 
of Sanitation Initiative of the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank [6] and to the WHO Water and Health 
Economics team [7].
6.3	
Financial Assessments
The ratio of benefits to costs is important for overall planning purposes but often managers are more interested in the 
financial benefits of an intervention. This may be particularly important in urban areas where utility service providers 
(public or private) need to assess whether their income from user payments will be adequate to cover the costs of providing 
services. 
A simple calculation can be made which compares the cost and income stream associated with an intervention over the 
lifecycle of the project. Spreadsheet-based calculations are ideally suited for this purpose. Expenses and income in the 
future are discounted, to reflect the fact that their value at today’s prices is lower than expenditures incurred in the present. 
The usual approach is to set up a spreadsheet with three rows and one column for each year of the project lifecycle. In the 
first row expenses are entered (so capital costs will appear in year one, and an annual maintenance cost in each subsequent 
year). Projected income from users is entered in the second row (possibly rising if additional users are likely to join the 
project over time). The net income (income minus expenditure) is calculated for each year in the third row. These net 
income values can then be discounted using the prevailing discount rate (usually the long-term interest rate associated 
with Bank investments) to give their net present value (NPV) in today’s money. Most spreadsheets will then calculate 
the net present value of the overall project summing the NPV for each year. A positive value means that the project is 
financially viable – the operator could borrow sufficient funds to invest in the capital, and this could be repaid through 
user fees over the lifecycle of the project. 
These simple calculations are important as they indicate whether a project is likely to be financially sustainable or not. 
However, in many cases governments are unwilling or unable to charge users the real costs of delivering the service. This 
is a particular problem with sanitation. When this happens, public subsidies are required to fill the shortfall.

Subsidies 
In a water, sanitation and hygiene programme several things require financing. From Chapter 5 we can broadly define 
these as:
• 
Supporting and Developing an Enabling environment: These could include expenditures linked to policy 
development, capacity building, knowledge sharing or coordination. However, it may be difficult to estimate 
those costs other than by taking a percentage of overhead costs for staff working on policy development at 
sector level, either within the Government or within donors.
• 
Hygiene behaviour change activities: This would include hygiene education and mobilisation activities in 
schools, communities and households, social marketing for handwashing with soap, interventions in the 
design of school curricula and teacher training etc.
• 
Sanitation marketing costs: market assessments, demand promotion, costs of community-led total 
sanitation activities, interventions to stimulate supply of appropriate goods and services (e.g. training or 
financial support to private providers) etc.
• 
Community development activities: usually to build capacity for community management if required;
• 
Cost of public infrastructure and services (capital and operational costs) of for example schools, public 
toilets, shared network services; and
• 
Cost of private infrastructure and services (capital and operational costs) of household sanitation[8].
Funding for these comes ultimately from only two sources – public funds from government and contributions from users. 
The government may have access to grant or subsidised loan funding from international agencies and NGOs but these 
will in general have to be repaid through general taxation. Private investors may make capital funds available but these 
would be expected to be recovered through user-fees.

Economics and Financing
Governments may choose to channel public funds into water and sanitation. There are several ways in which this can be 
done. Some of the most popular are discussed briefly below. A summary of financing options for sanitation in particular 
is shown in Table 6.5. 
Subsidised connection fees for urban water supplies and sewerage
One of the major barriers to accessing water supply for poor households in urban areas is the high and often very 
uncertain costs of a new connection. It is too difficult, often to the point of being impossible, for poor households to 
pay the upfront fee of USD 100 or more which is commonly charged. The Asian Development Bank has this to say:[9] 
“High and upfront water connection charges often act as a major barrier to connecting the poor. So why charge for 
a connection? Mobile companies provide free phones to attract subscribers. Supermarkets do not charge entrance 
fees to potential shoppers. Why can this not be applied to water services?” 
In fact connection fees are not necessary: the water-supply agency can either slightly increase the water tariff to cover 
connection fees, or it can recover the connection fee by a surcharge on the monthly water bill over period of, say, five 
years. Thus there is no need at all to ‘charge to enter the water shop’.[10] Reducing or removing connection fees is one of 
the single most progressive thing that a water utility or city authority can do to increase access for the poorest. In most 
cities, where it is the poorest who are most likely not to have a water connection, it can be one of the most effective 
redistributive measures available.
Cross subsidies on consumption of urban water
By contrast another popular type of subsidy is less progressive. Many operators employ what is known as an Increasing 
Block Tariff (IBT). IBTs:
“provide two or more prices for water used, where each price applies to a customer’s use with a defined block. Prices 
within IBTs rise with each successive block. Some tariff structures have as many as ten blocks, each with a different price. 
The common characteristic of IBTs, as they are applied in developing countries, is that the first block price is deliberately 
set below cost, however cost may be defined.” [11]
One of the best known IBTs in the world is used in South Africa, where the first 6 m3 of water (representing a lifeline 
consumption for a typical household) is provided free of charge to every household. Any consumption over the 6m3 - 
threshold is charged at an above-cost rate. The idea of an IBT is that poorer households can benefit from lower-cost water 
because they consume less. This argument may well hold true in South Africa where the lowest block has been kept low 
(at 6m3 per household per month).

Economics and Financing
However IBTs are known to have problems which make them a less-than-ideal option in many cases. In the 
first case, IBTs are based on the assumption that poor households consume less. This argument falls down if 
poor households cluster together to share a connection or where poor households are dependent on richer 
neighbours from whom they purchase water. In these cases the poor are likely to pay at the higher rate because 
their collective consumption is higher. Secondly IBTs guarantee that all consumers, rich and poor, benefit from 
the subsidy since everyone consumes within the first block – this means that funds which could be used to 
support poor consumers are used for everyone. Political pressures in many places ensure that the first block is 
significantly large and that the majority of households consumer water only within the subsidised band. Finally 
IBTs make it difficult for operators to predict or manage demand and do nothing to promote water conservation 
in the lowest price band. 
Although it may not seem to be the case, uniform tariffs based on metered consumption are often significantly more 
pro-poor than IBTs. [11] One form of cross-subsidy however is useful in some cases – that is a cross subsidy between 
commercial and domestic consumers.

Subsidised Toilets
Another popular form of subsidy is the provision of free or very cheap toilets. While these can appear to be very pro-
poor, care is needed in the design of subsidy programmes to ensure that they do not distort the provision of sanitation in 
unexpected ways. Some subsidy programmes tend to suppress technical innovations, resulting in overly-costly designs for 
which contractors know they are guaranteed payment. Quality may also suffer where government rather than the affected 
householders are responsible for overseeing construction. Subsidised latrines also suppress demand from communities 
(an effect which has been widely noted by practitioners of Community-led Total Sanitation). Nonetheless some better-
designed subsidy programmes do seem to have been relatively successful. In general those which leave control and 
decision making in the hands of householders themselves seem to be the most effective. These can generally be divided 
into two types – subsidies directed at service providers to enable them to offer sanitation facilities and services for sale 
more cheaply, and subsidies delivered in the form of cheap credit, to enable householders to borrow money at affordable 
rates to invest in sanitation.[xx]

Chapter 6: Key Messages
1.	 Water supply and sanitation are expensive. Calculating the full costs of systems and services is 
a critical part of project planning. The full costs include capital and operational costs as well as 
programming and support costs.
2.	 The benefits of investing in sanitation and water supply and very large. A global study estimated that 
for sanitation alone, an investment of $1 yields an average economic return of $9.
3.	 Both the economic and financial returns on investments in water supply and sanitation need to be 
calculated when preparing a project or programme. Economic returns are important in determining 
the extent to which public investments (government funding and international development aid 
expenditure) can be justified. Financial returns are important in determining how a project is to be 
financed, and whether it is financially sustainable and therefore viable. 
4.	 Public subsidies are often justified because of the huge public health benefits of water supply and 
sanitation but they need to be designed with care.

Annex A
Design of On-Site Sanitation Systems
This Annex details the design calculations required to determine the pit volumes for single-pit VIP latrines and single-pit 
pour-flush latrines, and for each of the two pits of alternating twin-pit pour-flush latrines, and the vault volumes for each 
of the two vaults of eThekwini latrines.
A.1	
 Single-pit VIP latrines
VIP-latrines pits are designed for the storage of digested faecal solids, as follows:
Effective pit volume (m3) = rPN
where r is the digested solids accumulation rate (m3 per person per year), P the number of people using the latrine (i.e., 
the household size), and N the effective life of the latrine (years).
Typically r = 0.05 m3 per person per year in ‘dry’ pits (i.e., the pit base is above the groundwater table at all times of the 
year) and 0.03 m3 per person per year in ‘wet’ pits (i.e., the pit base is below the groundwater table either permanently 
or seasonally) – if bulky anal cleansing materials (e.g., corn cobs, leaves, mud balls, stones) are used, these values are 
increased by 50%; and N is normally taken as 10 years.

The effective depth of the pit (H, m) is determined from the effective volume (V, m3) and its cross-sectional area. If D 
(m) is the pit diameter, then:
H = 
The total pit depth is (H + 0.5) m – i.e., there is 0.5-m freespace at the top of the pit.
A.2 	
eThekwini latrines
eThekwini latrines are alternating twin-vault latrines. The effective volume of each vault is rPN, as in section A.1, but 
with r = 0.1 m3 per person per year (this value is higher than that used in section A.1 as the vault contents are kept dry 
by the urine diversion, so solids digestion is much slower) and N = 1 year. 
The eThekwini latrines in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa have rectangular vaults, each 1210 mm × 1310 mm, with an overall 
height of 800 mm. Thus the volume of each vault is 1.27 m3. Assuming that the corresponding effective vault volume is 
0.8 m3, the number of people (P) that can use a vault of this size is given by:
P = 
 = 8
which is the average household size in eThekwini.

The pits for single-pit pour-flush latrines are designed both for solids storage (as in section A.1) and for the infiltration 
of the latrine flush-water.
The pit-sidewall area required for infiltration (the ‘infiltrative area’, Ai m2) is given by:
Ai = 
The wastewater (urine + flush water) flow is normally around 10−20 litres per person per day, and the long-term infiltration 
rate depends on the soil type, as follows:
• 
Sand: 50 l/m2 d
• 
Sandy loams: 30 l/m2 d
• 
Porous silty and silty clay loams: 20 l/m2 d
• 
Compact silty and silty-clay loams, and clays (but not expansive clays): 10 l/m2 d

Annex A
For circular pits of diameter D (m), the effective depth for infiltration (Hi, m) is given by:
Hi = 
The total depth of the pit is the sum of the effective depths for solids storage (as determined in section A.1) and for 
infiltration, plus 0.5 m freespace. This design ensures that there is still sufficient infiltrative area available when the pit 
has nearly reached its design solids-storage capacity.
A.4	
 Alternating twin-pit pour-flush latrines
The total depth of each pit is either the effective depth for solids storage (section A.1) or the effective depth for infiltration 
(section A.3), whichever is the larger, plus 0.5-m freespace. This design is possible because the infiltrative capacity of the 
sidewall is restored while each pit is not in use.

Annex B
Hydraulic Design of Simplified Sewers
Simplified sewerage is designed very rigorously. In this Annex the design is detailed first by considering the properties of 
a circular section (the small-diameter seweers usec in simplified sewerage are circular in cross section), then by showing 
how to determine the minimum sewer gradient (which ensures self-cleansing of the sewer), the sewer diameter, and 
whether hydrogen sulphide is likely to be a problem in the sewer or not. 
B.1	
Notation
The following notation is used for the hydraulic design of simplified sewerage − note that some parameters are used 
with two units (for example, the sewer diameter is calculated in m but quoted in mm, and the flow is in either m3/sec or 
litres/sec); special care must be taken to avoid any confusion with units and thus gross errors in the design calculations.

 Properties of a circular section
The flow in simplified sewers is always open channel flow – that is to say, there is always some free space above the flow 
of wastewater in the sewer. The hydraulic design of simplified sewers requires knowledge of the area of flow (a) and the 
hydraulic radius (r = a/p, the area of flow divided by the wetted perimeter). Both these parameters vary with the depth 
of flow, as shown in Figure B1.

Figure B1: Definition of parameters for open channel flow in a circular sewer. 
From this figure, trigonometric relationships can be derived for the following parameters:
• 
the area of flow (a), m2,
• 
the wetted perimeter (p), m,
• 
the hydraulic radius (r = a/p), m, and
• 
the breadth of flow (b), m.
These parameters depend on the following three parameters:
• 
the angle of flow (θ), radians,
• 
the depth of flow (d), m, and
• 
the sewer diameter (D), m.
The ratio d/D is termed the ‘proportional depth of flow’. In simplified sewerage the permissible range of d/D is 0.2−0.8 
– i.e., d cannot be <0.2D, nor >0.8D.
Elementary trigonometry gives the following relationships:

Annex B
B.3	
 Design procedure
The whole length of the sewer is divided into shorter sections over which the hydraulic gradient is reasonably uniform, 
and the minimum sewer gradient and the sewer diameter have to be determined for each section of the sewer. 
The minimum sewer gradient is based on the peak wastewater flow at the beginning of the design period (qi), and sewer 
diameter is based on the peak wastewater flow at the end of the design period (qf) – the reasons for this is that the sewer 
cannot become blocked at the start and it must be able to convey the wastewater flow at the end. 
The flows are based on the number of people (the ‘contributing population’) connected to the section of sewer being 
designed above its downstream end − i.e., the number of people discharging their wastewater into this section of sewer, 
including the upstream population whose wastewater enters the section at its upstream end. 
B.3.1.	
 Minimum sewer gradient
The peak daily wastewater flow (litres/sec) is estimated from the contributing population’s water consumption:
qi = k1k2Pw/86,400
where 86,400 is the number of seconds in a day.
The design values used in Brazil for k1and k2 are 1.8 and 0.85, respectively.[1] So this equation becomes:
qi = 1.8 × 10−5Pw
The sewer is designed to achieve a specified minimum tractive tension at peak flow to ensure that the sewer is ‘self-
cleansing’ – i.e., does not become blocked.[1,2] Tractive tension is the force per unit wetted area of the sewer exerted by 
the component of the wastewater weight per unit sewer length along the axis of wastewater flow (Figure B2); its units 
are N/m2 (i.e., Pascals, Pa).

Annex B
Thus, from Figure B2:
τ = Wsinϕ/pl = (ρgal)sinϕ/pl
Since a/p = the hydraulic radius, r:
τ = (ρgr)sinϕ
When ϕ is small, sinϕ = tanϕ, and tanϕ = the sewer gradient, i. Thus:
τ = ρgri
Since r = krD, this equation can be written as:
D = (τ/ρg)/kri
The flow qi can also be derived from the Gauckler-Manning equation for the velocity of flow:[3−5] 
v = (1/n)r2/3i1/2
Since qi = av:
qi = (1/n)ar2/3i1/2
Writing r as krD, a as kaD2 and D as (τ/ρg)/kri:
qi = (1/n)ka(kr)−2(τ/ρg)8/3i−13/6
This equation is known as the Gauckler-Manning flow equation. It can be rearranged, with i = Imin and τ = τmin, to give:
Imin = [(1/n)ka(kr)−2]6/13[τmin/ρg]16/13qi
−6/13
With n = 0.013, ρ = 1000 kg/m3, g = 9.81 m/s2, and with ka = 0.1118 and kr = 0.1206 (these are the values for d/D = 0.2, 
the minimum value used in simplified sewerage), this equation becomes:
Imin = 2.33 × 10−4 (τmin)16/13 qi
−6/13
The design value of τmin is 1 Pa.[4] Therefore:
Imin = 2.33 × 10−4 qi
−6/13

135 
Annex B
In this equation the units of qi are m3/s. 
For qi in litres/sec:
Imin = 5.64 × 10−3 qi
−6/13
So the minimum sewer gradient depends only on the peak wastewater flow.
A very important concept for the design of simplified sewerage is the use of a minimum peak flow of 1.5 litres/sec. This 
value, which is approximately the peak flow resulting from flushing a toilet, must be used if the value calculated for qi is 
less than this minimum value. 
▶For qi = 1.5 l/s, Imin is given by the last equation as 0.00468 (or 4.68‰) – i.e., 1 in 214, which is generally rounded to 1 
in 200 (5‰); a gradient of 1 in x means that the fall over a horizontal distance of x m is 1 m).
B.3.2	
 Sewer diameter
The sewer diameter is based on the peak flow at the end of the design period (qf – units: m3/s). The Gauckler-Manning 
flow equation is rewritten with i = Imin (the value calculated above with q = qi) and rearranged, as follows:
D = n3/8ka
−3/8kr
−1/4(
1/2
min
f / I
q
)3/8
Thus, with n = 0.013, ka = 0.6736 and kr = 0.3042 (the values for d/D = 0.8, the maximum value used in simplified sewerage):
D = 0.3064(
1/2
min
f / I
q
)3/8
In this equation D is in m and qf in m3/sec (not mm, not l/s). The calculated value of D is unlikely to be a commercially 
available size of sewer, so the next size up is chosen.
▶ The minimum sewer diameter used in simplified sewerage is 100 mm.
Alternatively the sewer diameter can be selected by using Table A2 as follows:
1.	 Determine qi and qf (units: m3/s). If qi <1.5 l/s (i.e., <0.0015 m3/s), then use qi = 0.0015 m3/s.
2.	 Calculate Imin.

This value appears twice in Table B2: at d/D = 0.60 for D = 100 mm, and at d/D = 0.32 for D = 150 mm. Choose the 
smaller diameter, so D = 100 mm.
(b) number of people served
If w = 100 litres per person per day, how many people can discharge their wastewater into this 100-mm diameter sewer 
laid at a gradient of 1 in 200? The peak flow per person is:
k1k2w/86,400 = (1.8 × 0.85 × 100)/86,400 = 0.00177 l/s
The sewer is designed for a peak flow of 2.5 l/s, so the number of people who can safely discharge their wastewater into 
the sewer is:
00177

= ~1,400 (or, for example, ~175 households of 8 persons per household).

B.3.3	
 Hydrogen sulphide control
Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) control is important in concrete sewers as corrosion of the sewer crown can occur (Figure B3). 
If H2S generation is likely, then concrete sewers should not be used. PVC sewers should be used instead. The likelihood 
of H2S generation is determined by calculating the ‘Pomeroy Z factor’:[6]
Z = 3 (BOD) (1.017)T−20 i−1/2 q−1/3 (p/b)
where BOD = the 5-day 20°C biochemical oxygen demand of the wastewater, mg/l; T = temperature, °C; i = sewer gradient, 
m/m; p = wetted perimeter, m; and b = breadth of flow, m.
The value of Z calculated from this equation is used diagnostically as follows: 
• 
Z <5000: H2S generation unlikely,
• 
5000 < Z < 10,000: H2S generation possible,
• 
Z >10,000: H2S generation very likely.
With simplified sewerage Z values are almost always >10,000, so PVC or vitrified clay sewers (rather than concrete or 
asbestos-cement sewers) should be used.
Figure B3: Microbially induced corrosion of the crown of concrete sewers.
Sulphates 
 in the raw wastewater are reduced anaerobically to sulphides by obligately anaerobic sulphate-reducing 
bacteria (such as Desulfovibrio spp.). Some of these sulphides exist as dissolved H2S gas and some of these H2S molecules 
leave the wastewater to raise the H2S partial pressure in the atmosphere in the sewer (Henry’s law). Some of the H2S 
molecules in the atmosphere enter droplets of condensation water clinging to the sewer crown (Henry’s law again), where 
they meet dissolved O2 molecules and are oxidized by the aerobic bacterium Thiobacillus thioparus to sulphuric acid 
(H2SO4), which attacks the cement in the concrete. Sewer crown collapse often occurs within 5−10 years in warm climates.

Annex C
Annex C
Hydraulic Design of Low-Cost Combined Sewers
Low-cost combined sewerage is rigorously designed to convey both the wastewater flow in dry periods and the stormwater 
flow resulting from a 5- or 10-year storm (i.e., an extreme rainfall event that may be expected, on average, to occur once 
every 5 or 10 years). The 5-year stormwater flow is used for residential areas and the 10-year stormwater flow for industrial 
and commercial areas.[1]
C.1	
 Basis of Hydraulic Design
The minimum sewer gradient (Imin) is determined first according to the principles in section B.3.1 of Annex B, using the 
dry-season peak wastewater flow from the contributing population, subject to the minimum peak flow of 1.5 l/s. 
The sewer diameter is then selected, using the procedure described in section B.3.2 of Annex B and Table C3, for the 5- or 
10-year stormwater flow (qS) which is determined as described in section C.2. 
▶The minimum sewer diameter used in low-cost combined sewerage is 400 mm, and the maximum size of the drainage 
basin is 12 km2.[1]
C.2	
Stormwater Flows
The peak flow resulting from a 5- or 10-year storm event can be determined by using the ‘rational method’, which computes 
the peak flow from the return period, the time of concentration, the storm (rainfall) intensity, and the characteristics of 
the drainage basin.[1−8] Although computer models are now more commonly used,[9−10] the rational method is sufficiently 
accurate for small catchment areas. (In the USA the rational method is commonly referred to as the Kuichling method,4 
and in the UK as the Lloyd-Davies method,5 although it was first developed by Mulvaney some 40 years earlier.3) 
The design procedure is as follows:[8]
1.	 Determine the catchment area (A, ha) to be served by the combined sewer being designed.
2.	 Select a return period of either 5 years (for residential areas) or 10 years (for industrial and commercial 
areas).
3.	 Select a value for the ‘time of concentration’ (tc). This is the time it takes for water falling on the most distant 
part of the catchment to enter the combined sewer and reach the part of the sewer being designed. For 
catchment areas <5 ha, tc can be taken as 15 minutes, and this value can also be used for larger catchments 
(up to 20 ha) if the average land slope is >0.5% (1 in 200). For flatter areas this value of tc should be 
increased by 1 minute for each hectare over 4 ha. 
4.	 Determine the maximum rainfall intensity (imax, mm/h) for the selected return period and the selected time 
of concentration. This is obtained from an Intensity-Duration-Frequency (i.e., rainfall intensity−time of 
concentration−return period) plot for the catchment area; such plots are commonly available from local 
departments of (urban) hydrology or water resources – an example for a particular catchment area is shown 
in Figure C1 (this cannot be used for other locations as the I-D-F plots will not be the same).

Annex C
5.	 Determine the ‘runoff coefficient’ (C, dimensionless). The value of C depends on (a) the runoff coefficient 
(CU) for the pervious area (i.e., the total area not paved and not covered by buildings) in the catchment; and 
(b) the percentage (P) of impervious area (i.e., the total impermeable paved area plus the total area covered 
by buildings) in the catchment. Typical values for CU and P are given in Tables C1 and C2, respectively. 
The value of C is then determined from Figure C2 using selected values of CU and P for the catchment area 
drained by the combined sewer being designed. 
6.	 The peak stormwater flow (qS) is now calculated from: qS = 2.78CimaxA In this equation qS is in l/s, imax in 
mm/h and A in ha.
7.	 Finally, the sewer diameter is selected using the procedure described in section B.3.2 of Annex B and Table 
C3 for the peak flow in the sewer (which is equal to the peak wastewater flow + the peak stormwater flow), 
subject to a minimum diameter of 400 mm.
