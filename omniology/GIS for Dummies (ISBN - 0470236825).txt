Introduction
D
o you plan to purchase a geographic information system (GIS) in the 
near future? Are you curious about what it can do for you and how you 
can get the most out of it? Do you need to use the software, or do you need 
to supervise others who use it? Do you have concerns about how GIS might 
change the way your organization functions?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, GIS For Dummies is the right 
book for you. GIS is some of the most exciting software to come along in ages, 
and I want to get you as excited about the possibilities GIS offers as I am. This 
book can help you start thinking about how you can use maps and harness 
the awesome power of this new technology.
About This Book
Unlike many books on GIS, this one isn’t meant to keep you spellbound for 
days or weeks. Instead, you can use this book when you need to answer basic 
questions or figure out what questions to ask your GIS-specialist friends. 
Think of this book as a reference you can use to find what you need when 
you need it.
The book gives you a big picture look at GIS — everything from the parts that 
make up the systems (see Chapter 1) to the spatial information products (see 
Chapter 20) that the systems produce. So wherever your interests in GIS point 
you, find those topics in the Table of Contents or Index and jump right in. 
Conventions Used in This Book
GIS terminology can get a bit confusing, especially with computer terms. I use 
the term raster to represent both a GIS data structure (composed of square 
grid cells) and the software based on that structure. When I talk about vector, 
I’m also referring to both the data structure (based on points, lines, and poly-
gons) and software that uses the structure. 
When I define a term for you, that term appears in italics. Also, I show URLs in 
monofont typeface to set them apart from the regular text.

GIS For Dummies 
What You’re Not to Read
You may feel the urge, every now and then, to explore some of the more 
advanced features of the GIS software. The GIS crowd might recognize these 
features and understand the details, but I don’t expect everyone to have 
(or want to have) that specialized knowledge. Most GIS analysis is based on 
pretty basic ideas about how things work in geographic space. Sometimes, 
GIS gets technical and uses fancier methods including mathematical proce-
dures that you probably don’t need to understand in depth. So, keep an eye 
out for the Technical Stuff icons and skip them if you want.
Also, I like to illustrate certain points with extra examples that appear in the 
book as sidebars. I think you’ll find the examples interesting, but they’re not 
essential to your understanding of the basics.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m going to assume that you’ve heard about GIS but don’t know all that 
much about its inner workings and hidden mechanisms. Many people think 
GIS (geographic information system) means GPS (global positioning system) 
because more people have heard the term GPS. In reality, GPS is just a part of 
GIS, and I tell you about that in Chapter 8. I assume you have something more 
than a casual interest in GIS, so I explain what GIS is, what it does, and how 
it can help you with what you do in your organization. Here are a few other 
assumptions I make:
 
✓ You know what a map is. GIS relies heavily on maps and map-related 
data. I assume that you have used a map of some kind, but aren’t an 
expert in either making or using maps. I provide all the background 
you need to become familiar with how maps represent the real-world 
geography. 
 
✓ You know what geography is. I assume that you’ve taken a geography 
class at some point in your life, but I don’t assume that you’re a geog-
rapher or that you think like a geographer. So I guide you on that path, 
as well. After you figure out how to think like a geographer (in mapping 
terms), GIS can become your friend and ally. You might even find it fun 
to use.
 
✓ You use some form of computer from time to time. GIS relies on 
computers. I don’t expect that you’re a computer technician, but I do 
assume that you know what data files and software programs are and 
how to use a computer interface. Beyond that, I explain some of the 
inner workings of the GIS software and databases so that you can ask 
intelligent questions of the GIS experts.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
GIS For Dummies contains six parts. They move from general background in 
geography and mapping in Part I, to the use of computers for maps in Part 
II, GIS data retrieval in Parts III, pattern identification and analysis in Part IV, 
a look at GIS output in Part V, and some helpful info about GIS vendors and 
data sources in the Part of Tens (Part VI).
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids
If you’re brand new to GIS, you may want to start here. Part I provides a gen-
eral overview of the book, explains the basic geography background needed 
to understand how maps represent the real world, and introduces you to 
some of the mapping terminology that you need to know to understand GIS-
speak. It covers map reading, symbolism, projections (moving from 3-D to 2-D), 
datums (starting points for measurement), scale issues, and generalization. 
You can see the power of map data and how getting them into your computer 
really improves your ability to make use of information contain in maps.
Part II: Geography Goes Digital
Part II deals with how you get data from your paper maps into the computer. 
If you’re unsure about how GIS data work inside the computer, this part can 
give you the answers. In this part, I show you the two basic models used for 
digital map representation (grids, called raster; and points, lines, and poly-
gons, called vector). You find out how these different models enable you to 
keep track of the geographic features you include in your GIS and how the 
models link these features to the descriptive information that eventually 
winds up in your GIS output (such as a map legend).
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and 
Characterizing Geography
Part III is for people who want to know how to use GIS to answer questions. It 
includes information about how to find the geographic features that you put 
in your GIS database, different ways of searching for features, how to count 
them up when you find them, and how you can describe what you find. In this 
part, you discover how to locate and characterize features by type or cat-
egory, by their sizes and shapes, by measurements that describe them, and 
even by where they’re located relative to each other in geographic space.

GIS For Dummies 
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns
GIS does its most powerful work when analyzing the patterns that you iden-
tify, and Part IV focuses on that subject. You see how to measure lengths, 
areas, distances, and volumes; as well as how to work with networks, such 
as highways and streets. I explain both topographic and non-topographic 
surfaces, how to analyze rivers and determine where water will flow during 
flooding, and how to determine places that an observer can and can’t see 
from a certain point. I even show you how to combine maps and use a power-
ful map analysis language called map algebra. 
This part can’t make you an expert in GIS analysis, but it can help you figure 
out enough to start your analyses and talk knowledgeably with the experts.
Part V: GIS Output and Application
In Part V, I show you how to make the most of all your GIS queries and analy-
sis. You can find out about the various types of map output, as well as non-
map output, that you can use to help explain the results of your work. I tell 
you how GIS can generate travel directions, customer lists, alarms, and even 
movies that show maps through time. Finally, I show you how to smoothly 
incorporate this high-level technology into your organization so that you can 
quickly take advantage of its power.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In the Part of Tens, I introduce ten GIS software vendors and explain what 
other products and services they provide. I also provide a handy list of ques-
tions to ask those vendors before you decide where to purchase software, 
products, and services. Finally, I also provide a list of sources of GIS data 
from government and private companies — both free and for purchase.
Icons Used in This Book
GIS For Dummies uses little pictures, or icons, that help direct your reading. 
These little graphics can save you time by letting you find all the high points 
quickly.

 Introduction
 
The Tip icon provides a few helpful hints about shortcuts, best practices, and 
just plain common sense when it comes to GIS. GIS tips help you do the right 
things at the right time for the right reasons. Each tip comes with an explana-
tion about why it’s a good idea, too.
 
I use the Warning icon to keep you from making mistakes that are very hard to 
recover from. Unfortunately, GIS doesn’t come with many built-in safety mech-
anisms, so I try to point out potential problem points.
 
The Remember icon is sort of like a summary of important points that you 
need to focus on. In some cases, I remind you of things I cover recently in the 
chapter, and in other cases, I highlight material from other parts of the book 
and explain how it applies to that specific discussion. Think of them like tiny 
refresher courses.
GIS
 
The Real World GIS icon highlights all the places that you can find out how 
people use GIS to accomplish real tasks in the real world.
 
When you see the Technical Stuff icon, you don’t have to read the technical 
information to understand the surrounding text — but you might want to look 
at it and get a sense of all the possibilities of GIS.
Where to Go from Here
Because GIS software changes all the time, the user community requires 
constant updating and retraining. Many fine community colleges, techni-
cal schools, colleges, and universities provide formal education in GIS, and 
some provide continuing education courses to help you keep up with what’s 
going on. Some vendors offer face-to-face and online courses (largely geared 
toward their product line, of course).
You can also keep updated by interacting with other users. In the past, 
you’d make these contacts through professional meetings, trade shows, and 
user group meetings (which still draw plenty of users). Today’s technology 
provides you with a supplemental method of keeping current. Blogs, wikis, 
forums, and RSS feeds now provide a vast array of methods that you can 
use to obtain just the right answer in a timely fashion without ever having to 
leave your computer. Even the vendors themselves often provide audio and 
video podcasts that give updates on the newest software wrinkles. Here are 
a few prominent Web-based resources that you can use to continue your GIS 
education:

Part I
GIS: Geography 
on Steroids

In this part . . .
N
o, I’m not advocating the use of steroids, but I am 
advocating GIS. In this part, I provide an introduc-
tion to all the geography and map-related capabilities that 
underlie the enormous power of GIS. You find out how GIS 
has merged the speed and strength of a computer with a 
geographer’s robust toolkit. And even more impressive, 
you see how this merger has produced one of the most 
transforming technologies of the 21st century.

E
verything you experience from day to day happens somewhere in 
geographic space. As a result, you can represent your world and your 
experiences in it by using maps. You use those maps to find places, save time 
while traveling, decide where to locate a new store, plan cities, guide the 
development of wildlife preserves, and satisfy hundreds of other applications.
In this day of digitized everything, the maps you use to represent the world 
reside inside the computer, and you now have at your fingertips the ability to 
search those maps, find objects and routes, and plan related activities. The 
computer systems that enable you to store and access all this information 
are collectively called geographic information systems (GIS). This book is all 
about GIS and how it helps you make decisions.
To recognize how important this tool is, you only have to think about how 
people use maps today and how adding the power of a computer can help 
you make both better and faster decisions. Here are a few quick examples:
 
✓ For business owners and marketers: You want to put up a new toy store 
in a location that gives you access to a lot of customers. To find the right 
location for your store, you need to know who your customers are (par-
ents of children) and where they live (so that you can locate near them). 
GIS software can find your customers and identify suitable nearby loca-
tions where you can locate your store.
 
✓ For urban planners: Say that you’re a land-use planner trying to figure 
out the best way to use a new parcel of land just annexed to the city. To 
make such decisions, you use mapped information stored in the com-
puter to compare the characteristics of the new parcel to existing land 
uses and facilities. You can even create a map that shows what the final 
zoning map should look like.

10
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
 
✓ For merchandise distributors: Suppose you work for a wholesale 
grocer, and you need to move your trucks quickly from store to store by 
using existing road networks. GIS makes a very complex task — picking 
the fastest routes for different times of day — very easy for you.
In this chapter, I help you get a feel for how a GIS is organized and how you 
can use it to make many kinds of decisions — effectively, faster, and with 
better outcomes than you can with traditional maps alone. Jump in and get 
ready to enjoy the exciting world of GIS.
Getting a Feel for GIS
A GIS is an operational system that allows resource managers to use some of 
the tools and skills that geographers use, and a little bit more. Using GIS soft-
ware, you can put maps and other geographic data into the computer. After 
you have the data in the computer, you can store, retrieve, and edit that data. 
You can analyze it (for example, find geographic features, measure distances, 
or compare patterns) and produce output from it (create new maps from 
what you find).
Here are some of the things you can do with GIS software:
 
✓ Selectively retrieve bits and pieces of one or more maps.
 
✓ Count, group, reclassify, isolate, and quantify features and their patterns 
on the landscape.
 
✓ Measure lengths, widths, distances, heights, and volumes of features.
 
✓ Overlay one map on another to compare features and create new maps.
 
✓ Visualize, interpolate (predict missing values), slice, cross-section, and 
generalize surfaces of all kinds.
 
✓ Track movements and changes in patterns, and predict and exploit pat-
tern change.
 
✓ Find the shortest, fastest, or most beautiful path, identify potential cus-
tomers, and locate businesses.
 
✓ Perform various topographic feature analyses, such as groundwater 
(subsurface movement of liquid), surface flow (liquids running on the 
surface), accumulation (liquid gathering in low spots), visibility (places 
you can see from a specific location), and a host of other analyses.
As the preceding list shows you, GIS is a diverse and powerful tool. In fact, GIS 
is among the most complex software ever written. It’s so complex because it 
deals with techniques that geographers and related professionals have been 
devising to analyze maps and map-related data for over 2,500 years. Because 
of the advances in computer speed and efficiency, new techniques are being 

11
 Chapter 1: Seeing the Scope of GIS
added all the time. GIS is truly transformative software: It has the power to 
change the way decisions are made all over the world. But the software is part 
of a much larger system, which I describe throughout this book.
Meeting the GIS Collective
The whole of GIS is greater than the sum of its individual parts. And GIS 
has more parts than just the software and the hardware that drives it (see 
Figure 1-1). Here are the basic parts that make up the whole GIS:
 
✓ Data and information
 
✓ Computers, input and output technology, and computer software
 
✓ Geographic and related concepts that drive the analysis
 
✓ People, such as operators, managers, consultants, vendors, and so on
 
✓ Institutions and organizations within which the GIS exists

Accumulating geographic data
Projects are the driving force behind GIS analysis and products, but data pro-
vide the fuel. Without relevant, timely, accurate data, the GIS can do little to 
assist decision makers. GIS works with many types of data, but you can group 
them into two basic categories: primary and secondary. Primary data are 
collected firsthand by you, for a particular project. Primary data are usually 

12
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
the best data for the job because you collect them with your specific goals 
in mind. Secondary data come from others who collect the data for unrelated 
tasks or gather it with remote sensors.
To get data into a GIS, follow these steps:
 
1. Define how and where to best gather, acquire, or sample the data.
 
 Defining how and where to collect data involves decisions about 
whether you want to use existing GIS data or maps, collect field data, 
perform a census, take polls, interpret aerial photographs, take GPS 
readings, or use satellites that provide images of the Earth. Deciding 
what type of data you want to collect requires some specific idea of your 
data needs and how you can best meet those needs.
 
2. Collect, or sample, data directly or indirectly by using sensors.
 
 The process of collecting depends on your choice of data. The variety 
of input comes with many possible questions regarding location, scale, 
sampling schemes, instruments, projections, datums (see Chapter 2), 
and time. A good collecting methodology, combined with good instru-
mentation, can have a huge impact on the quality of analysis that your 
GIS can perform.
 
3. Transform the data into a form the computer can recognize.
 
 Having good data doesn’t help your GIS if you can’t get it into the com-
puter. If you’re lucky, the data you need are already in a format that 
your GIS can use. Otherwise, the process of moving analog or non-
GIS-compatible data into the computer can be a major part of the GIS 
operation — both in terms of time and money. You may need to change 
some data from hard copy to digital forms; you may need to convert 
some from uncategorized to categorized data (for example, aerial photo 
interpretation); and you may need to attach coordinates to digital data 
so that you can find them in your digital maps.
Adding the right computing power
Your computer houses the software that does much of the work of analyzing 
and manipulating the GIS data. But you need many other forms of hardware 
and software components working together for analysis to happen.
Hardware related to GIS comes in four flavors:
 
✓ Data collection devices: Collection devices include soil probes, GPS 
units, analog and digital cameras, voice recorders, satellite remote sens-
ing devices, and telemetry devices. Many of these devices have their 
own data formats and software that your GIS must be able to work with. 
Fortunately, most equipment vendors recognize this need, so their 
output is GIS compatible.

13
 Chapter 1: Seeing the Scope of GIS
 
✓ Data input devices: Input devices include the computer itself, which 
you can use to trace lines or collect points from images right on-screen; 
manual digitizers (basically, really big mouse pads that include position 
sensors and very sensitive mice); and scanners, both little flatbed scan-
ners and really huge drum scanners that you can use to input big maps. 
All these devices have their own software and graphics languages that 
your GIS translates for you.
 
✓ Data storage devices and analysis software: The computer that holds 
the GIS software also provides storage (both internal and external) and 
other programs that allow you to analyze lots of map data.
 
✓ Data output devices: Output devices normally include your computer 
monitor with its many different sizes and number of pixels, printers of 
all sorts and types, and plotters. Some output devices (such as the moni-
tor) are better for looking things over while you work, some are good for 
small-sized output (printers), and others do well for larger-sized output 
(plotters). Some output devices are effective for only small numbers 
of copies, and others work well when you have large, production-scale 
jobs. You need to decide which of these devices fits your GIS needs.
The software that comes with input and output devices is usually designed 
for those specific types of devices. You get the software when you buy the 
hardware itself. But with GIS, you get to pick out the software that you’ll 
use with your hardware. You can find very simple GIS software and very 
complex GIS software. Your GIS software might prefer that its data look like 
little squares (grid cells), or it might want more graphic-like data. Some GIS 
software includes a large suite of programs for many uses, but others might 
be quite specific to a particular set of tasks (such as working with roads and 
other networks). You need to know your GIS needs and talk to many vendors 
to find the GIS software that’s right for you.
 
Computers differ by type and by operating system. Be sure that the software 
you choose for your GIS work is compatible with your computer. Also, don’t 
buy some GIS software simply because it’s exciting or the most complete — or 
because it’s the most expensive. Know your needs and match the hardware 
and the software to those needs. You always have time to grow bigger and 
upgrade later, if you need to.
Providing display and representation
GIS is more than a geographic analysis tool; it’s also a display and representa-
tion tool. In fact, when you look at preliminary results on your screen, those 
results often give you ideas about what else you might want to do or how you 
want to proceed with your analysis. Plus, you can now produce the outcome 
of your work in much more interesting ways, for example, with animations 
and perspective views that allow you to examine your data more thoroughly.

14
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
 
Here are just some of the ways that people can use GIS in their daily lives:
 
✓ An environmental scientist can drape the vegetation from one map over 
a 3D view of the topography so that he can visualize the relationships 
between elevation and vegetation.
 
✓ A Realtor can pull up a map that shows six houses within the client’s 
price range. By clicking each house, the Realtor can also get text infor-
mation, digital photographs, and even a virtual tour of each house to 
help the client decide whether to visit.
 
✓ At a city council meeting, an urban planner wants to demonstrate where 
the city is growing, so she uses a series of maps of the city displayed as 
a short animated film.
 
✓ A Native American group combines GIS-based maps of their lands with 
verbal history files compiled as hot-linked digital movies showing the 
actual residents. The group can then use these maps to help preserve 
details of their culture for future generations.
 
✓ At a national park, patrons can use a special user interface to locate 
parts of the park on a map, and the software takes them on a virtual fly-
through, showing them the features from a hang glider’s perspective.
 
✓ A field agent for a company wants to show his land inventory supervisor 
an aerial photograph of the company’s land, including the parcel lines. 
He uses his laptop GIS software to send that photograph directly to his 
hand-held device so that together they can make decisions immediately.
GIS software offers a ton of possibilities, and those possibilities keep expand-
ing while the technology continues to get faster.
Working with people
GIS software is sold by people, to be used by people, to make decisions that 
affect people. These people may work in business, government, military, edu-
cation, not-for-profit, medical, and hundreds of other types of organizations. 
GIS helps these organizations do their work effectively. Because it’s high-end 
technology (requiring a major investment in systems and training), GIS also 
changes the way organizations work.
 
Organizations that use GIS work best when the organization adapts itself to 
the technology. If GIS helps the organization perform its tasks, if the employ-
ees are adapting to and benefitting from the changes, if the organization pro-
vides training, and if GIS enhances the organization’s overall goals, that 
organization can likely incorporate GIS successfully, long-term. The vast 
majority of failures to successfully incorporate GIS are a result of poor design 
or, in most cases, no design at all.
GIS

15
 Chapter 1: Seeing the Scope of GIS
Fortunately, there has been a growth in the number of GIS specialists called 
system designers who help organizations integrate GIS into their practices. 
A system designer reviews an organization’s structure, products, workflow, 
and needs. He or she then determines the costs and benefits of GIS for that 
organization, as well as how the organization might best include GIS in criti-
cal operations. If you’re thinking about GIS, first look for a system design 
professional. I explain some of the ins and outs of GIS design in Chapter 20.
Knowing How to Think Spatially
All tools are designed to meet a certain need. Sharp things are for cutting, 
hard things for hammering, and pointy things for binding things together. 
GIS is also a tool. Geographers, who needed a tool (more like a toolkit) to 
answer geographic questions, were the primary designers of the original GIS 
software. Today, many disciplines have contributed enormously to this grow-
ing field, but the questions GIS is designed to answer remain fundamentally 
geographic ones.
To get the most out of your GIS experience, you need to get familiar with 
some geography. By geography, I’m not talking about knowing the capital of 
Lichtenstein or the third largest selling product in Wisconsin. Knowing those 
facts might come in handy when you play Trivial Pursuit, but that informa-
tion can’t help you think like a geographer.
 
Thinking like a geographer means that you see the world primarily as maps. 
You see maps everywhere, and those maps show you patterns, distributions, 
and co-occurrences of geographic features. Think of how your occupation, 
your business, or your recreation depends on location and distance. The 
maps you examine begin to come alive with questions such as these:
 
✓ Can I sell a lot of clothes if I put my new clothing store next to the new 
subdivision?
 
✓ What’s the easiest way to get downtown during rush hour traffic?
 
✓ Where’s the best place for me to build my vacation home?
 
✓ Does the north or east end of town have more gang activity during the 
summer months?
 
✓ Why does such a high incidence of cancer mortality occur in this part of 
the state?
 
✓ What reasons might account for the gap in the distribution of this bird 
species?
 
✓ Where will traffic congestion be most problematic in ten years, given the 
current patterns of population change?

16
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
Geographers answer these kinds of questions, and they use GIS to help figure 
out the answers. GIS allows them to identify, characterize, question, analyze, 
explain, and finally exploit their knowledge of patterns and distributions. You 
don’t need to be a geographer to think geographically, but you do need to 
think geographically to take full advantage of GIS.
Recognizing the spatial 
nature of questions
Geographers know that all things are related in geographic space, but close 
things are more related than far things. This statement describes one aspect 
of geographic space — closeness — that makes space so important to you as 
a geographic decision-maker. For example, your business might be more suc-
cessful if you could position it closer to your customers. And the closer you 
are to the beach, the more likely you are to include swimming in your daily 
exercise routine.
You encounter many other aspects of space in everyday life. Each aspect of 
space has an effect on what you do. Here are some aspects of geographic 
space to help get you thinking spatially:
 
✓ Density: If you are an urban planner, the more houses in an area (the 
higher the density), the more potential riders you have for a public tran-
sit system.
 
✓ Sinuosity: Ever notice how those winding subdivisions force you to 
drive slowly? Urban planners design the winding streets purposefully 
so that pedestrians don’t have to worry about getting hit by high-speed 
traffic.
 
✓ Connectivity: People find it difficult to get to some small towns in isolated 
parts of countries, which shows the impact that a lack of connectivity can 
have on your ability to get from one place to another.
 
✓ Pattern change: Over time, a lot of agricultural landscape becomes very 
fragmented by pockets of residential neighborhoods. What impact might 
this change have on future agricultural production or habitat for deer?
 
✓ Movement: Weathermen track the paths of hurricanes, and when they 
can predict where the storms will travel next, they can save lives.
 
✓ Shape: A developer wants to buy a piece of land, but wants to make sure 
that it’s square, not oblong, so that the new big house to be built will 
have plenty of space on all sides.
 
✓ Size: As a farmer, you need large chunks of land because you’re using 
large equipment that doesn’t work in small parcels.

17
 Chapter 1: Seeing the Scope of GIS
 
✓ Isolation: You’re a business owner, and you notice that the number of 
people who visit your store is dropping. Do you suppose this decline is 
happening because all the surrounding stores have gone out of business?
 
✓ Adjacency: The value of your home goes down because the zoning 
board just rezoned the adjacent parcel for commercial use.
All these factors and many more have one thing in common — they all 
require an ability to see, acknowledge, and question spatial locations, pat-
terns, and distributions. Many fields have certain patterns that they use. 
Business owners watch the bottom line, historians watch events through 
time, and meteorologists watch the changes in weather elements. To work 
effectively in their fields, these people must gain a heightened awareness of 
the features and patterns relevant to their own occupations. Likewise, GIS 
practitioners have to make sense of the patterns in spatial information — so 
they can use that information to make good decisions.
So, how do you become more sensitive to spatial patterns? Like anything 
else, it takes practice. If you want to see patterns in maps, look at a lot of 
maps. You come to recognize patterns of traffic by consciously thinking 
about the traffic density and flow when you drive. Aerial photographs give 
you a bird’s-eye view of land patterns. Satellite images show major patterns 
that cover large chunks of the Earth.
 
Read maps, study aerial photographs, peruse satellite images, and — most 
important — practice creating, querying, and analyzing spatial data with GIS. 
The more you work with it, and the more you interact with other users, the 
more easily you can see patterns. You can soon be on your way to thinking in 
GIS terms — spatially.
Discovering what’s so special 
about spatial data
Thinking spatially helps you work with GIS data after you put those data in 
the computer. But to become really proficient, you have to know something 
about how to structure geographic data so that the computer can think more 
like you do. Because computers don’t read maps, you have to exactly iden-
tify each item, including its name, its values and properties, and how many 
dimensions it has. But if you define every type of object that makes up your 
data correctly, your GIS software knows what to do with it. The following sec-
tions cover the two most important aspects of geographic data that your GIS 
needs to know: dimensionality and descriptions.

18
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
Understanding points, lines, polygons, and surfaces
Geographic data come in four basic forms: points, lines, polygons (or areas), 
and surfaces. A fifth form, related to surfaces, is volumes. Each of these types 
of data brings with it a particular dimensionality and an associated set of 
descriptive characteristics. You determine the dimensionality and charac-
teristics of geographic data by how you conceive them, at what scale you 
observe them, and for what purpose you intend to use them.
Here’s a quick summary of these different dimensions and characteristics:
 
✓ Points: Zero-dimensional features. Because every object takes up space, 
no geographic feature can really have no length or width. Instead, you 
can use points to represent geographic features on maps. You can think 
of a city as a point if you simply want to examine its name and loca-
tion on a large regional map, for example. Obviously, a city has length 
and width, but at a certain scale, you can represent it as only a point. 
(Chapter 2 tells you all about map scale and its effect on geographic 
features.) Points on your map and in your GIS might include objects 
such as wells, churches, houses, towns, or trees, depending on the scale 
you’re working with.
 
✓ Lines: One-dimensional features, or features that have length. Many line 
features also have width in real life, but like with points, GIS software 
assumes that they don’t. Features that a cartographer depicts as lines 
include roads, rail lines, fault zones, fences, and hedgerows. Lines that 
generally do have no width in real life are those that indicate the separa-
tion between two or more places, such as state, local, or national borders. 
Because you know that all lines inside the computer have length, you can 
measure characteristics such as length and sinuosity in GIS.
 
✓ Polygons: More commonly known as areas. The two dimensions of 
areas — length and width — give you some serious power because you 
can use them to measure perimeter, area, shape, and the longest and 
shortest axis by using your GIS. Typical areas that you can find in a GIS 
include political regions (such as states and countries), land-use and 
land-cover zones, fields, and many more.
 
✓ Surfaces: Have three dimensions — length, width, and a third dimension 
determined by the characteristics of the surface. Physical surfaces allow 
you to calculate volumes, predict trends, and determine the direction of 
the flow of fluids. You may work with many types of physical surfaces, 
as well as some nonphysical surfaces. You might encounter topographic 
surfaces, air pressure surfaces, bathymetric (underwater) surfaces, 
economic surfaces, and population surfaces.
You can examine each of these types of geographic objects individually. The 
fun starts when you compare them and work with them all at the same time. 
You can give these objects names and a lot of other descriptions that you 
may want to use in your analyses.

19
 Chapter 1: Seeing the Scope of GIS
Putting names and numbers on spatial data
GIS is more than graphics. Most systems contain database tables that allow 
you to store all sorts of descriptive information about the points, lines, areas, 
and surfaces that you’re depicting in your GIS. The nature of database tables 
requires you to be just as picky about assigning descriptive information 
to your objects as you are about choosing the right graphics to depict the 
objects themselves. You need to understand the basics of consistent data 
description because many GIS mistakes (for example, retrieving the wrong 
data) can occur if you incorrectly mix descriptions when you do data analysis.
Here are the levels of description and a brief explanation of each:
 
✓ Nominal: Geographic features that have names only. So, you can’t com-
pare their descriptive information to any other. Examples of nominal 
descriptions you might find on a map include the Bethel Synagogue, Lake 
Drive, Maple Township, and Mount Flattop.
 
✓ Ordinal: Geographic features that you can compare by rank. You could 
have short, medium, and tall trees; dirt roads, paved roads, highways, 
and superhighways; or large, medium, and small chemical spills.
 
✓ Interval: Geographic features that have detailed increments (intervals) 
that you can measure. One limiting characteristic of interval data is that, 
although you can get very accurate measurements, you can’t form ratios 
because the starting point is arbitrary. For example, if the soil in land 
parcel A is 15 degrees centigrade and the soil in parcel B is 30 degrees, 
you can say that soil B is 15 degrees warmer than soil A, but you can’t 
say that it’s twice as warm because 0 degrees centigrade is an arbitrary 
starting place and the temperature values can thus be negative.
 
✓ Ratio: Geographic data that have measurable units, like interval data, 
but also allow you to make the ratio comparisons that interval data 
won’t. If you own a parcel of land that’s worth $20,000 and your neigh-
bor has a parcel worth $10,000, then your parcel isn’t just worth $10,000 
more, it’s also twice as expensive. The key point is that ratio data have 
an absolute 0. A person can’t have a negative weight, and the number of 
people can’t be a negative value.
 
✓ Scalar: Scalar data are a bit difficult to define, but here’s my take: Scalar 
data have a proprietary measurement system. That is, you create your 
own scale that applies to only a particular set of data. So, if you’re rank-
ing the beauty of a scenic overlook on a scale of 1 to 10, you first have to 
decide what each number in the scale means. GIS allows you to establish a 
scalar description for features that you can’t really measure any other way.
 
The computer represents even nominal data (names) with numbers in the GIS 
database. Try to avoid using mathematical techniques that force you to multi-
ply the numbers that represent nominal categories by ordinal, interval, or 
ratio numbers. Attempting to multiply a nominal category (urban) by a ratio 
category (feet) often yields downright silly results (in this case, urban feet).

At Least 101 Uses of GIS
GIS is like duct tape; it has many, many uses. You can find modern professional 
GIS software for all types of users. Because you’re reading this book right now, 
you probably already suspect (or know) that GIS can help you. Some applica-
tions (such as managing land records or natural resource inventories) are 
pretty standard and provide valuable, timely information. Other applications 
(such as predicting flood potential or estimating potential hurricane damage) 
are more experimental and even stretch the capabilities of the GIS.
Managing business activities
GIS is about business. In fact, a whole new industry of business geographics 
is developing because GIS can affect the bottom line, improve product qual-
ity, and provide new opportunities. Here are a few examples of how different 
sectors of the business world are using GIS:
 
✓ Banking: GIS activities in banking and financial institutions include regu-
latory compliance (such as home mortgage disclosure act regulations), 
customer prospecting, and locating new branches and ATMs.
 
✓ Business locations and customer behavior: You can more effectively 
figure out where to place a business if you know your customer base’s 
location. The closer or more accessible you are to the people whose 
buying patterns match your products, the more apt you are to be 
successful. Businesses can also compare market share with other sur-
rounding businesses and adjust to changing demographic conditions.
 
✓ Insurance claims adjustment: GIS can perform all the typical business 
and marketing tasks, including identifying potential clients, and deter-
mining risk factors. And if you’re an insurance broker, imagine being 
able to match applications for storm and flood insurance with a map of 
the 100-year flood zone.
 
✓ Journalism: The media, especially the television news media, use flyth-
roughs, zoom-ins, and visual overlays of maps on imagery, providing a 
media-rich and enticing product.
 
✓ Real estate: Real estate agents, both residential and commercial, use a 
GIS (the multiple listing service) to search for and select properties that 
match client needs. Some appraisers use GIS to perform mass appraisals 
of whole regions at the same time.
 
✓ Trucking and delivery: Moving products and material is getting more 
expensive all the time. Minimizing route lengths reduces cost, speeds 
delivery times, and increases customer satisfaction. GIS has tools spe-
cifically designed to work with road and rail networks.

21
 Chapter 1: Seeing the Scope of GIS
Planning city operations and expansion
City, county, and regional planning has long used GIS to track development, 
zone land parcels, assess available resources, and plan for future growth. 
GIS allows planners to evaluate master plans, monitor expansion and traffic 
patterns, predict change, monitor population, and even decide the best place 
to put the new government planning office. Many GIS operations across the 
world are called planning departments, not GIS departments. But they often 
use GIS as their primary tool.
Providing protection and 
emergency services
Police, human services, and emergency services (the Enhanced-911 call-rout-
ing service, for example) are beginning to use GIS. Crime mappers can iden-
tify crime hot spots and move officers where needed, corrections officers can 
track their parolees, hospitals can be placed where they meet the most need, 
and dispatchers can route emergency services (such as ambulance and fire) 
to their destinations — all with the power of GIS.
Land management and conservation
The first major implementation of GIS managed the enormous expanse of 
Canada’s natural and mineral resources. In this and similar applications, the 
software can help monitor fires and dispatch firefighters, monitor and manage 
disease and insect outbreaks, control land use and land inventory, select set-
asides and easements, track and manage wildlife, plan for ecotourism, and 
much more. Combined with today’s expanding complement of Earth-sensing 
satellites, the role of GIS in land management is sure to continue to expand.
Military and defense-related tasks
The military and intelligence communities are taking advantage of the GIS 
toolkit, which includes tools specifically targeted to those users. By com-
bining top-secret satellite data and visual evaluation from unmanned aerial 
vehicles (UAVs) with the power of GIS and existing datasets, defense depart-
ments can evaluate troop movements, target artillery fire, test scenarios, per-
form supply and logistics operations, and monitor borders. The military and 
intelligence communities often rely on the same geospatial tools available to 
the general public — but they have exclusive access to certain data and data 
sources, as well as some additional and quite sophisticated software.

22
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
A treasure chest of possibilities
Really, the potential uses of GIS have no limit. Jack Dangermond, the presi-
dent of Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), has been quoted as 
saying, “The application of GIS is only limited by the mind of the user.” I’ve 
seen GIS used to reconstruct American Revolutionary War battles, follow the 
Salem witch trials, track debris from falling space equipment, assist hotline 
psychics (yes, you read that correctly) with profiling their callers, monitor 
honey bee movement, control farm equipment, tell ranchers where to move 
their livestock, and plan interesting entertainment sites.
While traditional applications of GIS technology remain the mainstay of 
the industry, GIS uses continue to expand. GIS capabilities also continue to 
increase while humanity’s knowledge of geography grows and people encode 
that knowledge into databases and GIS algorithms. If you’re getting into GIS 
now, you’ll probably spend much of your time figuring out both the concepts 
that drive GIS and the new software that keeps coming out — just when you 
think you know what to do with your existing software.
If you enter the term geographic information systems in an Internet 
search engine, such as Google (www.google.com), you retrieve well over 
11,000,000 hits. You may find the volume of information a bit overwhelming, 
but you can keep up with all the many changes by looking to GIS faculty at 
colleges and universities, GIS company Web sites, and online GIS communities.
 
You get over 50,000,000 hits if you enter the keyword GIS in an Internet search 
engine, but many of the results you get deal with U.S. military GIs, not geo-
graphic information systems.

M
aps are a compact and elegant method of communicating information. 
Most folks have used maps in one form or another for a variety of pur-
poses. You’ve probably used road maps to help you find your way from one 
town to another and street maps to get around in a city or town. The maps 
in newspapers show what’s happening in different parts of the world. An 
atlas may be just the key you need to figure out the name of a mountain for a 
crossword puzzle. If a map is designed correctly, you can find much of what 
you’re seeking without any help at all, and you can interpret the data with 
little effort. This chapter sets you on course to understanding the sometimes 
complex, but usually intuitive, language of maps.
Knowing How Maps Represent 
Geography
Like with any form of communication, you must apply some basic standards 
before a map can effortlessly communicate the information it contains. Even 
when you sketch a simple map on a piece of paper, the first decision you 
must make is how much space you need to create the map. You can think 
of this area as your map extent. When you use a GIS to either create a map 
or analyze map data, you make decisions about how much area you want 
to work with. The area of your digital map is related to the actual amount 
of geographic space that you’re examining, but it’s much smaller than the 

24
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
real geographic space. This relationship, called map scale, also determines 
how big you can make the graphic objects (symbols) and how many of those 
objects you can put on the map.
Understanding scale
Naturally, the portion of the Earth represented on a map is much larger than 
the drawing. The map and the Earth are at different scales. Scale determines 
how much or how little detail your map can hold.
You can often find a map’s scale represented by a graphic bar and a fraction 
that shows the relationship between the size of the map in the numerator 
(the fraction’s top part) and the size of the Earth in the denominator (the frac-
tion’s bottom part). Using this mathematical approach, the smaller the frac-
tion (one with a small numerator and a large denominator), the smaller the 
scale. The smaller the map scale, the larger the amount of the Earth that map 
represents.
To get this representation to work, the mapmaker (cartographer) uses a little 
trick or two. Instead of including all the detail of the Earth, he or she selects 
which objects to show and decides how much graphic detail of each object 
he or she can omit to save space while still expressing the necessary infor-
mation. Table 2-1 — from the U.S. Geological Survey of typical map scales — 
shows the amount of the Earth that different map scales represent.

 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
Both the mapmaker and the map user need to know map scale so they can 
(respectively) create and read the map properly. I show how map scale 
affects your GIS operations in the section “Grasping the importance of scale,” 
later in this chapter.
Interpreting symbols
Shades, lines, shapes, and words are the language of a map. A map may con-
tain various shaded lines, little white squares, circles, gray patches, words, 
letters, and numbers. You may find the number of symbols a little over-
whelming. As a GIS and map user, you really need only to recognize that all 
the symbols do have a purpose on the paper. They don’t just happen (much 
to the chagrin of the people who have to make them). Cartographers plan out 
the selection, size, placement, and design of all these symbols before putting 
those symbols on the map. Figure 2-1 shows a road map, representing part of 
England, that contains various symbols.
 
Figure 2-1: 
Symbols on 
a map of 
England.
 
At first glance, the map in Figure 2-1 may appear disorganized. But each 
symbol appears in a particular place because it represents some real-world 
feature that exists in more or less the same place on the Earth. For example, 
the city of Reading is on the right side of the map, and Pangbourne is to the 
left and up a bit. This positioning tells you that Pangbourne is north and west 
of Reading (if you assume that north is toward the top of the map). Because 
you can relate the symbols to the features they represent, you can quickly 
orient yourself to the map. Without ever visiting England, you can see how 
the various towns are arranged in space relative to one another. You can also 
see that lines, which represent roads, connect these point symbols.
Chapter 3 explains how to translate map symbols.

26
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
Incorporating symbols into your map
A map’s symbols show you what geographic features are represented on the 
map and where they occur. Cartographers use symbols that represent point 
features (such as towns), symbols that represent linear features (such as 
roads and rivers), and symbols that represent area features (such as lakes 
and towns). I know, I know — I said towns twice! How can towns be both 
points and areas?
The short answer is that choosing the right symbol to represent a particular 
feature depends on a map’s scale. If you live in a big city, you might have a 
whole fold-out map to represent the area that your city occupies. That map 
is at a fairly large scale (perhaps 1:30,000) and is designed to show small 
areas in detail. If you look at your city on a map in a world atlas, however, 
that city may show up as a single dot. Figure 2-2 shows how the same 
geographic feature looks on maps of different scales.
 
Figure 2-2: 
A city 
shown 
on large-
scale and 
small-scale 
(upper-right 
inset) maps.
 
The cartographer has to decide when to represent area features as points 
and when to represent them as areas. One of the biggest headaches that car-
tographers deal with is deciding how to generalize map symbols to represent 
reality as best they can. The factors that they have to consider when they 
make such decisions include the following:
 
✓ Scale: Determines how many geographic features can be symbolized on 
a map. When cartographers have tons of data to represent, their symbol 
choices have to take into account map readability. So, they make deci-
sions to try to avoid symbol crowding. The cartographer has to decide 
which features to include, which to omit, which to simplify, and which to 
move to make room for other symbols.
 
✓ Data availability: Determines what type of information can be put on 
the map. Cartographers can’t make up data (if they want their maps to 
be accurate, that is). For example, suppose that the cartographer wants 

27
 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
to portray 12 land-use types on a 2008 land-use map, but has data for 
only 5 land-use types from 1968. In this case, he or she won’t be able to 
produce the 2008 land-use map without collecting more data.
 
✓ Limitations of output devices: The cartographer also has to consider 
how symbols will print. He or she must know which features are most 
important to show (at the map scale to be used for printing) and plan 
the symbols to use accordingly.
 
✓ Reader characteristics: Not all readers have 20/20 vision, color vision, 
or any vision at all. Moreover, some maps are designed to be read close-
up (a few inches from your face) while others are displayed on walls and 
read from a distance. So, who reads the map and how they read it affect 
decisions about
 
• Whether to use color or black and white
 
• How large or small to make the scale, symbols, and fonts
 
• Whether to include tactile symbols for vision-impaired map users
 
Many traditional maps serve as input to your GIS, so all the generalizations 
that cartographers make impact the quality of the analysis that results from 
the system. Also, when you’re ready to produce your own maps (Chapter 19), 
you need to be aware of these issues.
Recognizing the Different Types of Maps
Anyone who creates a map must consider the content and subject of the 
map. He or she must assign a topic, or theme, to the map and set the indi-
vidual details in the proper context. If you’re creating a map to your garden 
party, for example, you must include roads so that your guests know what 
pathways to travel. Landmarks and buildings may also help the reader get 
oriented to your part of town. You may also include text on the map, such as, 
“Turn left at the ugly purple house.”
 
In a technical conversation, words often have different or more precise mean-
ings than in a general conversation. The context and the theme are just as 
important in mapping as in a general conversation. A map needs a unique con-
text, a specific vocabulary, and a set of rules that pull all these parts together 
so that both the mapmaker and the map reader can understand each other 
and make the best possible GIS.
The easiest way to categorize maps is to separate them into two basic 
groups — reference maps and thematic maps, as described in the following 
sections.

28
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
Reading reference maps
Reference maps offer a great deal of information on a single document. Atlases 
generally contain reference maps so that many related maps can be contained 
in the same place. Reference maps often cover very large portions of the Earth, 
which means they’re created at small scales. Therefore, reference maps aren’t 
designed to provide extremely accurate depictions of locations. Instead, 
reference maps offer only the pattern and general locations of things.
Reference maps also commonly contain several types of information on the 
same map. In this way, the map helps orient users to the geography of the 
area represented, as a whole. A typical reference map contains features such 
as regional borders; names of major cities; major transportation routes; and 
often prominent physical features, such as major rivers, lakes, and mountain 
ranges. Figure 2-3 shows a reference map of the Middle East from the CIA 
World Fact Book, which includes regional borders, transportation routes, and 
physical features.
 
Figure 2-3: 
Reference 
maps may 
contain 
several 
types of 
information.
 

29
 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
Using thematic maps
A thematic map provides as much accurate, detailed information as possible 
about a particular subject, such as roads or hills, as compared to a reference 
map (discussed in the preceding section), which tries to select the most 
important information about several subjects.
When you view a reference map, such as the one shown in Figure 2-3, you can 
see a number of themes of data — in this case, regional, transportation, and 
physical features. The reference map doesn’t present these themes in much 
detail, and it doesn’t have the primary purpose of communicating specifics. For 
example, although the map includes transportation information, that informa-
tion isn’t complete — it’s very general because of the small scale of the map, 
and the different types of routes aren’t clearly identified. This map wouldn’t 
help you much if you were trying to navigate within Saudi Arabia or Iran.
For navigating, you need a road map, as shown in Figure 2-1. A road map 
is one example of a thematic map because it focuses on communicating 
information about roads. Although such a thematic map might include a 
few regional subdivisions and other landmarks, the majority of the map is 
designed so that you know which roads are two lane and which are one 
lane, which are dirt roads and which are superhighways, which are one-way 
streets and which are two-way streets, and so on.
 
Thematic maps are the primary kind of maps that you use in your GIS activi-
ties. Although you might find reference maps useful for some projects that 
involve large study areas, the small scale of reference maps usually limits their 
usefulness for analysis. The more familiar you become with the wide variety of 
thematic maps available to you, the more easily you can recognize which 
maps might assist you in your GIS work.
The list of potential thematic maps is staggering; here are a few examples:
 
✓ Medical maps: Cancer mortality, spread of epidemics, and health haz-
ards can be map subjects. Medical professionals may use such maps to 
determine characteristics of locations where some diseases occur, con-
centrate, and spread. Knowing these factors can help them in their goals 
to prevent or cure disease.
 
✓ Hazardous material maps: These maps give transportation companies 
information about where trucks carrying hazardous material can travel, 
as well as the relative locations of people at risk (for example, the 
elderly or hospital patients).
 
✓ Law enforcement maps: These kinds of maps show the police crime hot 
spots, locations of officers, crimes by time of day and season, and socio-
economic factors that might affect crime rates.

30
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
 
✓ Utility maps: Gas and electric utility infrastructure maps can include 
data about the type of equipment, its condition and age, and many other 
factors affecting the energy companies’ ability to provide and sustain 
services.
If a feature appears or an event occurs on the surface of the Earth, it can 
be — and often has been — mapped.
Grasping the importance of scale
When compared to thematic maps, reference maps are often created on too 
small a scale to be particularly useful for GIS. But even thematic maps come 
in many different scales. A good rule of thumb is that the larger the map 
scale, the smaller the area covered and the greater the detail. Larger scale 
maps are generally better for your GIS activities because they provide the 
largest amount of detail.
If all maps were of the same highly detailed scale, you wouldn’t have to think 
about what scale a particular map uses. Unfortunately, you find many maps 
at many different scales. In fact, most GIS databases contain a lot data from 
differently scaled maps. Each map has more or less detail, more or less posi-
tional accuracy, and more or less information content. When you’re looking 
on a map for data to include in a GIS, the cartographer has already decided 
what to include and what to leave out, how to symbolize features, and how 
much to generalize the shapes used on the map.
Using a wide range of data
Thematic maps come in all sorts of sizes and 
shapes, and they can cover all kinds of different 
topics. Think about all the things that actually 
occur on the Earth, and you start getting some 
idea about the number of potential thematic 
maps. Here’s a short list of some of the kinds of 
maps that contain socioeconomic information 
and how you might begin to learn to recognize 
and apply these patterns for business:
 ✓ Median family income: If you’re trying to 
start a business that sells expensive jew-
elry, you probably want to place your store 
in an area that has a high median family 
income.
 ✓ Education level attained: If you sell techni-
cal books, you want to know where people 
with college degrees live so that you can 
locate near them.
 ✓ Mean number of children under 5 years old: 
If you want to sell baby clothes, you ideally 
want to establish your store close to large 
concentrations of people that have young 
children.
This set of examples uses a useful concept in 
geography — all things are related to each 
other in geographic space, but close things are 
more related than far things.
GIS

31
 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
The more detail, the more complete the information, and the more precisely 
located the geographic features, the better the analytical results you can get. 
You might think that the poorest quality map determines the quality of your 
analysis. This weakest link hypothesis makes sense on the surface, doesn’t it? 
In cases where each map layer is of equal importance, this hypothesis might 
be true. However, in most GIS analysis that you do, the different map layers 
aren’t equally important. Maps that are poorer in quality may still add value 
to your GIS as long as their lower accuracy does not affect the overall quality 
of the analysis.
Working with Projections and Datums
Except for members of the Flat Earth Society, everyone accepts that the 
Earth is roughly spherical. This spherical shape has some major drawbacks 
for the mapmaker who’s faced with producing a flat map that correctly rep-
resents the shapes, angles, distances, and sizes of objects on the Earth. In 
simple terms, the conversion from a sphere to a flat map is always going to 
result in some distortion. Peel an orange and try to flatten the peels on a 
table; now you have a visual idea of the problem that the mapmaker faces.
Comparing thematic maps
All things are related to each other in geo-
graphic space, but close things are more 
related than far things. This concept is used 
frequently in GIS when thematic maps are 
compared to see what things occur near each 
other. For example, you can use these maps to 
do a variety of analyses:
 ✓ Earthquake hazards
 ✓ 100-year flood zone
 ✓ Soils with high shrink-swell clay
If, for example, you can locate the zones with the 
highest frequency of earthquake, your insurance 
company can decide whether to issue earth-
quake hazard insurance, or your builder might 
have to use some earthquake-proof building 
techniques to allow for that type of activity. 
Insurance companies that issue flood insur-
ance need to know whether their potential 
customers live within an area that’s likely to 
flood frequently. The building contractor would 
find a soils map that shows high shrink-swell 
clay useful so that he or she knows whether to 
add pylons to reinforce that new skyscraper to 
keep it from becoming the next Leaning Tower 
of Pisa.

Picking the right projections
Figure 2-4 shows some of the many ways a map can look. Map projections —
the process of converting the spherical Earth to a flat surface — come in 
many different types, from contiguous to interrupted, from those that look 
like photographs of the Earth to those placed on cones or cylinders. In fact, 
cartographers often refer to the three families of map projections as planar, 
conic, and cylindrical, which describe the surfaces onto which the surface of 
the Earth would be projected (hence the term projection) if a light bulb could 
be put in the center of the Earth.
 
Figure 2-4: 
A map can

different 
ways, each

some 
form of 
distortion.
 
The curved surfaces of the Earth just don’t cooperate when you try to make 
them flat. The mapmaker has to figure out which of the map’s properties 
he or she most wants to preserve. For maps designed to measure distance, 
the mapmaker might choose to preserve distance on the map. Another map 
might be used to determine directions, which requires that shapes be pre-
served. Anyone trying to measure areas or changes in areas wants a map that 
preserves area.
The good news is that you don’t have to know all the gory details about how 
the mapmaker preserves certain properties to work with GIS — but you do 
want to know which properties are mostly preserved.
 
When working with GIS, pick the map projection that best represents the 
properties you want preserved when you create output maps from your analy-
sis. For example, if your analysis involves changes in area, a map projection 
that preserves area is the best type to use to display your results.
 
Most high-end GIS software has the capability to convert back and forth from 
one projection to another. Most have more map projections than you’ll ever 
use. But every time you change from one projection to another, the software

 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
rounds off numbers and makes tiny errors in position. If you convert projec-
tions repeatedly, these tiny errors in position start to add up. Eventually, you 
can add enough error to have a negative impact on your analytical calculations.
Good projections depend 
on accurate datums
The impact of converting projections, like with many other GIS-related trans-
formations, depends on scale. Small scale maps will be affected more than 
large scale maps. Having an accurate representation of distance and area 
measurements in any projected map depends on having accurate measure-
ments of the spherical Earth. The science of geodesy deals specifically with 
these measurements.
Like with any measurement, you need to have a place to start, a baseline. In 
geodesy, such baselines for measuring the Earth are called datums. In simple 
terms, the datum is a model of the Earth’s shape that allows geodetic scien-
tists and surveyors to accurately measure the Earth and place the origins and 
orientation of the coordinate systems.
Each of the hundreds of datums has different measurement units and methods 
for measuring the Earth. Some datums start by measuring the Earth’s diameter 
in different directions, others focus on flatness ratios (ratio between the polar 
and equatorial diameters), and still others are based on measuring the Earth’s 
circumference at different places Because each datum uses different methods 
and different models of the Earth (which are called reference ellipsoids), the 
maps associated with a datum depend on these properties. Table 2-2 gives you 
an idea of the possible datums you might encounter in your work. You can find 
a quite exhaustive (or is that exhausting?) list of datums online at
www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/datum/datum_f.html

Your GIS software needs to know what datum you’re using for each set of 
map data that you put into your database. Attaching your coordinates to 
the wrong datum can result in location and measurement errors. You’ll 
commonly begin with maps that use different datums. To make your GIS 
data from maps of the same area correspond to each other, they all need to 
be converted to a common datum.
 
When loading up your GIS, be sure to use the correct datum for each map 
source as you add it. Also, convert all your map data to a common datum 
when you work with more than one source map at a time.
Working with Coordinate Systems 
and Land Subdivisions
No matter what the theme, projection, or scale, you need to find your way 
around on your maps — and that’s what coordinate systems help you do. 
On a globe, you use the latitude-longitude system. On flat maps, you have to 

35
 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
convert this geographic grid to something a bit more practical. Ultimately, all 
coordinate systems are based to some extent on the geographic grid.
But after you take a spherical object such as the Earth and flatten it, you 
need to have a grid that conforms to this new surface. In other words, after 
you project the spherical Earth onto a flat surface, you need to put a set 
of direction lines on that flat surface which conform to the distortions the 
projection just produced. So, coordinate systems are often linked to specific 
types of map projections.
Meeting the Universal Transverse 
Mercator (I know you want to)
You don’t need to know the details of all the different types of coordinate 
systems to be good at GIS. You do need to know the basics of how coordinate 
systems work, though. One of the many possible coordinate systems that 
you may encounter in GIS is called the UTM system. UTM stands for Universal 
Transverse Mercator, which is the most commonly used system.
This system divides the Earth from latitude 84° north and 80° south into 60 
numbered vertical zones, each 6 degrees of longitude wide.
Each UTM zone has two places from which measurements begin (origins):
 
✓ The equator
 
✓ 100,000,000 meters south of the equator (80° south latitude)
Dividing the Earth by using UTM has two big benefits:
 
✓ You can measure stuff in positive numbers east and north from one of 
the origins, regardless of which hemisphere you’re in.
 
✓ You never have to use negative numbers.
Figure 2-5 shows a diagram of the UTM coordinate system. The zones are 
numbered, starting at the 180th meridian, in an eastward direction. Each 
zone is divided into rows (or sections) of 8 degrees latitude each, with the 
exception of the northernmost section, which is 12 degrees, allowing the 
system to cover all the land of the northern hemisphere. You can isolate 
small sections of the Earth because you locate them by a number/letter 
combination. With the exception of the northernmost group, each of these 
sections occupies 100,000 meters on a side and can be designated by eastings 
and northings (that is, positive measurements eastward and northward of the 
origin) of up to five-digit accuracy (1-meter level resolution).

Measuring the land
Coordinate systems help you measure geographic features, as well as find 
your way around and locate things on a map. One major feature you’ll likely 
encounter in your GIS work is land ownership, and you’ll find many systems 
that measure and record this feature. I describe a common one used in the 
United States to help you understand the relationship between land measure-
ment and the coordinate system.
GIS
 
The U.S. Public Land Survey System (PLSS) was established in the late 1700s 
to divide up the ever increasing lands that the U.S. Government acquired. The 
PLSS is similar to a rectangular coordinate system, but it’s not directly linked 
to any particular map projection.

37
 Chapter 2: Recognizing How Maps Show Information
This land ownership recording system is based on the acre, which is 1/640 of a 
square mile (a section). Thirty-six sections are grouped together into townships 
and numbered in serpentine fashion from upper-right (section 1) to lower-right 
(section 36). A land records specialist can subdivide these chunks of land into 
halves and quarters so that he or she can describe the land holdings by these 
fractions. For example, the PLSS system describes the plot of land you own as 
something like NE1/4 SE1/4 N1/2 Sect. 23, T144, R35E.
Maps as questions, as well as answers
Most map readers assume the map is accurate, 
which isn’t always true, depending on the scale. 
More importantly, though, most believe that the 
map answers the question, “Where is ______?” 
You fill in the blank. Well, I’m not going to argue 
with you there — the map really does display 
(within its graphic and scale limits) locations 
and distributions of all sorts of geographic fea-
tures. But that’s just the beginning. The geogra-
pher and the GIS professional often see a map 
as just the beginning, rather than an end.
Let me help you understand where these folks 
are coming from. The GIS is designed to input 
data from maps, and then compare the loca-
tions and distributions of geographic features 
from one map to another. Well, would you add 
map data into the GIS if you didn’t think that you 
could use the data for analysis? And you prob-
ably select your maps with particular questions 
in mind. Because you’re using maps, it’s also a 
safe bet that your questions revolve around the 
locations and patterns of the geographic fea-
tures you choose to include.
So, for example, if you’re a crime analyst, you 
might have a map of auto thefts for your city. 
This map answers the question, “Where are the 
auto thefts?” But, if you needed to know only 
where thefts occur, you wouldn’t need to put 
it into the computer. You have questions about 
the locations and distributions. You might want 
to know some of the following:
 ✓ Do the auto thefts occur more in some 
areas than in others — does your city have 
auto theft “hot spots”?
 ✓ Do the number of cars stolen increase 
at any particular time of day, day of the 
week, month, or year (is there a temporal 
pattern)?
 ✓ Do other distributions seem to match that 
of the auto thefts? Or, stated differently, 
do spatial correlations exist between auto 
thefts and other factors, such as neighbor-
hood type, access to major highways, or 
gang activity?
The map is both an answer and a question. 
When you look at a map, especially if you’re 
considering including it in a GIS database, you 
should start asking questions about the distribu-
tions and patterns that you observe. The ques-
tion is always the same — “What explains this 
distribution?” GIS gives you tools to answer that 
question. And if you can explain a distribution, 
you can begin to predict future distributions and 
make plans accordingly.
So, if you’re a transportation planner and you 
notice that the traffic counts are increasing 
in a particular neighborhood, your analysis 
might show that this traffic increase is very 
strongly related to population increases in cer-
tain neighborhoods. Your next step might be to 
build a predictive map of future transportation 
while the population grows. You can then use 
that prediction to suggest improvements to the 
transportation system. In a way, GIS makes you 
a really great prognosticator.

38
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
All these land portions are part of a larger coordinate system of horizon-
tal and vertical lines. Distance is measured north and south (township) of 
starting lines called baselines, and east and west (range) from starting lines 
called principal meridians. These township and range lines allow for the legal 
descriptions of land.
The notation that identifies a parcel of land starts with the smallest subdivision 
of land, then gives the section number, and then township and range numbers. 
A legal land description based on this system includes the state name, prin-
cipal meridian name, township and range designations, and section number. 
Figure 2-6 shows a breakdown of the PLSS system.
Such land subdivision systems enable you to build GIS databases that have 
land ownership correlated to other factors, such as zoning restrictions or 
price per acre.

▶ Translating map symbols
▶ Spotting patterns
▶ Analyzing the patterns you identify
▶ Applying your conclusions to the decision-making process
P
eople who explore GIS are often most astonished by the wide variety of 
content-specific (thematic) maps available. You need to have a working 
knowledge of the many varieties of maps and the types of symbols they use 
so that you can determine the best way to input data, as well as know the 
types of maps you use for a given application.
While you become familiar with maps, especially thematic maps, you begin to 
identify patterns in the symbols on the paper. Spotting patterns isn’t as easy as 
you might think because those abstract symbols represent sensory data con-
tained on the map. The experience is akin to finding your way around a new 
town — you get the hang of it while you press further into your exploration.
This chapter shows you how to identify patterns within the sometimes com-
plex map symbology. Also, you can find out how to ask questions about the 
patterns you identify, answer those questions through GIS analysis, and ulti-
mately make decisions based on your analysis.

40
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
Making Sense of Symbols
Many types of maps are available, and each type has a unique set of symbols. 
Symbols are lines, objects, or pictures on the map that represent real objects 
on the ground. With so many map types, each with its own set of symbols, 
you can easily become confused when trying to interpret the maps. You can 
make the process easier on yourself by looking at the dimensions and the 
types of measurement scales available for mapping and GIS operations, as 
described in the following sections.
Categorizing the space on a map
Categorizing the space represented on maps helps make symbology easier to 
understand. The types of space that occur in maps are
 
✓ Points: Considered zero-dimensional because they take up no space 
at all. Points show up as symbols representing the locations of objects 
such as towns, wells, or churches. These symbols might be dots for 
towns, a tiny caricature of a well for wells, or a cross for Christian 
churches.
 
✓ Lines: One-dimensional (measured by length). Lines might be streets, 
roads, or railroad tracks symbolized by different types or colors of lines 
on the map.
 
✓ Areas: Two-dimensional (measured by length and width). Areas might be 
color patterns on city street maps that indicate different neighborhoods 
or suburbs, or they might be patches of blue to show the location of lakes.
 
✓ Volumes: Three-dimensional (measured by length, width, and depth or 
height).Volume spaces are important when you want to identify some-
thing such as a buried coal seam. Volumes show up as area symbols on 
a map.
When it comes to map symbols, volumes and surfaces are treated pretty 
much the same. Unlike volumes, however, surfaces are thought to “blanket” 
something, rather than include what’s inside. For example, if you’re inter-
ested in the vegetation covering a mountain, you’re really interested in only 
the elevation’s surface. But, if you’re interested in how much coal is located 
underground, you need to know not just the surface of the ore seam, but also 
its whole volume because you’ll be extracting that volume.
 
Four types of objects are symbolized on your map — points (zero-
dimensional), lines (one-dimensional), areas (two-dimensional), and volumes 
(three-dimensional).

41
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
Understanding levels of measurement
All map data, including point, line, area, and volume data, come in one of four 
levels of measurement:
 
✓ Nominal: Objects are often identified by their name — a church, a 
house, an interstate highway, rail lines, the range of a plant or animal 
species, or a parcel of land. This level of measurement is called nominal, 
meaning named. You can’t compare nominal measurements to each 
other. The comparison can be literally apples and oranges.
 
✓ Ordinal: You might also categorize things by a general category of size, 
such as a small, medium, or large house, road, or land parcel. Such 
objects are measured at the ordinal scale. The ordinal scale character-
izes things by their rank or order in a sequence, so the name ordinal 
refers to the ordering or ranking.
 
✓ Interval: If you have detail and can actually measure things by intervals, 
you might use the interval scale. The interval scale also places things in 
order, but you can measure the relative difference by exact intervals. 
For example, the number 10 is 90 units lower than 100.
 
 Because points are technically considered to have no dimensions, 
measuring them at the interval scale may seem, well . . . pointless, but 
that’s not necessarily the case. The point may represent something 
that’s measurable at that scale, such as an average soil temperature in 
degrees Fahrenheit.
 
 You can’t make ratios out of interval scale objects. So, if a soil is 32 
degrees Fahrenheit in one place (A) and 16 degrees Fahrenheit in another 
(B), you can say that A is 16 degrees warmer than B, but you can’t say 
that A is twice as warm as B. The starting point for Fahrenheit was chosen 
for convenience rather than to represent an absolute starting point where 
the temperature is at the lowest possible level. Dates on calendars are 
also interval because different calendars have different starting points 
(for example, the Mayan calendar versus the Gregorian calendar), and the 
starting points aren’t based on when time actually began.
 
✓ Ratio: Items that have an absolute starting point, such as population 
(where zero is the lowest number you can have), are measured at 
the ratio scale. The term ratio is used because you actually can make 
comparison ratios out of such things. For example, a city (A) that has 
a population of 2,000,000 people has twice the population of another 
city (B) that has 1,000,000 people — the ratio here is 2 to 1 or 2:1. Other 
examples of ratio data include the size of a parcel of land, the length of a 
border, or the volume of a buried ore body.

42
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
 
GIS incorporates four primary scales of geographic data measurement — 
nominal (named, non-comparative), ordinal (ranked, relative sizes), interval 
(measured by increments, but with an arbitrary starting point), and ratio 
(measured in increments with an absolute starting point, allowing for ratio 
comparisons).
Understanding the relationship between 
symbology and data measurement
Figure 3-1 shows a table that illustrates the relationships between each scale 
of data measurement and the symbols depicting geographic features. Each 
table entry includes an example or two of the type of geographic features 
that you might run across in your GIS activity.

In Figure 3-1, you can find some symbols used for various features on a map: 
point (zero-dimensional), line (one-dimensional), and area (two-dimensional). 
Along the left side, the list of measurement scales combines interval and 
ratio. Although these two data measurement scales do have their differences, 
the combination makes sense because they share identical symbology.
Working with nominal features
The data measurement level shown at the bottom of Figure 3-1 is nominal. 
The figure shows typical geographic objects that you encounter on a map, 
including a town, a mine, a stream, and a forest. A picture or graphic symbol 

43
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
represents each of these features on the map. These features and many more 
like them are non-comparative, which means you can’t compare them to each 
other directly. You can’t easily compare Oakmont, the town, to the Black 
Hills mine.
Other non-comparative features include
 
✓ Line features: Streets, rail lines, and boundaries, for example, are unique 
entities and can’t be compared to one another. Geographers say that 
they’re not the same kind of feature.
 
✓ Areas: A swamp, the range of a wild species, the land owned by the fed-
eral or state government, or the type of zoning for a particular parcel of 
land are also unique and can’t be compared.
 
✓ Volume features: Water aquifers, hills, and buried ore bodies all take 
up volume and are named on maps. You can acknowledge that they 
exist and give them specific names, but you can’t compare ore bodies 
to aquifers.
Depicting features that use the ordinal scale
You can add ordinal (ranked) attributes to points, lines, areas, and volumes. 
Inhabited regions have names, and you can also rank them as hamlets, vil-
lages, towns, and cities. This ranking indicates that the features aren’t only 
the same kind of feature — inhabited places — but they’re also different sizes 
of inhabited places.
Geographers call these distinctions comparisons of kind, and apply such rank-
ing as follows:
 
✓ For line data, such as roads: You may want to depict dirt roads, single 
lane highways, superhighways, and so on. These lines are comparable 
because they have attributes that are relative in size (ordinal).
 
✓ For volume data, such as an ore body: You can categorize the ore qual-
ity as low-, medium-, or high-grade ore.
Comparing data using the interval and ratio scales
Although the symbols used to represent interval and ratio scales are identi-
cal, mapmakers have many options for designing these symbols. To indicate 
different sizes on the scales, the cartographer can change the size of sym-
bols. How much the symbols vary in size is directly related to the size of the 
features that the symbols represent, which is why cartographers call such 
symbols graduated symbols. So, each symbol can be graduated (or sized) to 
the feature it represents. Easy squeezy.
Not so fast — there’s a catch. Consider this example: The United States has 
about 3,000 counties. If each county has a map area that contains, say, only 
30 towns and cities (in reality, most counties probably contain many more 

44
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
towns and cities than 30), you have 90,000 towns and cities that all need 
symbols. Even if you map only one town for every third county, you still have 
1,000 symbols. If each town has a different population, a dedicated cartog-
rapher calculates the relative size for each one of those 1,000 symbols. Just 
imagine the frustration for a map reader trying to identify the differences 
among so many symbols.
The good news is that you can find a better way to select symbol sizes so the 
reader will be able to recognize them. You can group these point symbols 
to show that features have various sizes by assigning them to classes which 
break up the range of values into a small set. For example, the population of 
cities can be grouped into classes with limits of 0 to 10,000, 10,001 to 100,000, 
100,001 to 1 million, and over 1 million. Cartographers have a lot of methods 
that they can use to determine the class limits for point symbols. More impor-
tantly, they can apply these same methods to line, area, and volume data that 
are measured with the interval/ratio scales. Here are some examples:
 
✓ For line features: Imagine using different-sized lines to represent the 
levels of flow in a river or stream (see Figure 3-1).
 
✓ For area features: Consider showing the potential area that a hazardous 
spill might occupy as a set of differently sized tear-drop shaped symbols.
 
✓ For volume features: A cartographer can represent the sizes of ore 
bodies as a set of irregularly shaped area symbols that increase in size, 
or even symbols shaded to look 3-D.
 
Cartographers spend a great deal of time creating symbols for point, line, area, 
and volume features. They’ve developed a host of methods for standardizing 
the symbols and determining class limits. The good news is that this work has 
been done for you. The so-so news is that the map data grouped together in 
this way are less accurate than the raw data used to compile the maps.
Recognizing Patterns
One cool thing about maps is that the symbols represent a scaled-down version 
of real geography. As much as possible, the map’s symbolic objects, features, 
and background are distributed and located in ways that closely resemble the 
locations and distributions of real objects. This aspect of a map is important 
because patterns of geographic features are — more often than not — related 
to an underlying process and, as a result, represent cause and effect.
The processes that create location and distribution patterns often took place 
in the past and are typically still in play during the present. By extension, the 
processes operating today will continue to operate in the future. Although 

45
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
these statements are generalizations — subject to changes in speed, and 
the continuation or secession of the underlying processes — making this 
assumption allows you to undertake the description, explanation, and predic-
tion of patterns. In this way, you interpret the patterns — but first, you need 
to recognize that patterns exist.
When you identify patterns, you look for a degree of predictability in the 
arrangement of the objects you’re interested in. For example, if you see a 
map showing a group of trees that are dying from some disease, you can pre-
dict that the adjacent trees are likely to become infected and die eventually.
 
Each person interprets patterns differently, based on experience, background, 
and a variety of other factors. To make the best use of GIS information, the 
trick is to notice patterns that you may not be used to seeing, such as patterns 
of trees, houses, roads, rivers, or any other features you encounter.
Identifying random distributional patterns
People see spatial patterns based on the separation between objects that 
they’re observing, meaning they notice how close together or far apart the 
objects are. Some objects, such as dandelions in your yard, occur pretty 
much at random (like in Figure 3-2). This type of distributional pattern occurs 
because of the process that spreads the dandelion seeds. The seeds are 
spread by the wind, carried on animals — or even people — and spread in 
other ways that produce a random distribution. The spatial pattern made by 
these dandelions reflects the widely varying distances between individual 
plants. Some dandelions are close to each other (within inches), some are far 
away (several yards), and others are somewhere in between (a few feet).

Finding clustered distributional patterns
Certain features occur in clumps, or clusters. In such cases, similar features 
tend to be very close together (in a cluster), and another cluster of these 
same features may be far apart from the first cluster. In a clustered distri-
butional pattern, a significant number of features tend to cluster together in 
portions of your study area. For example, crimes tend to occur in clusters, 
called hot spots, around specific neighborhoods (as shown in Figure 3-3). 
These hot spots reflect the processes that facilitate crime, such as the avail-
ability of victims or the location of criminals. You might, for example, expect 
to find clusters of jewelry thefts in locations where wealthy people who have 
expensive jewelry live. After you start seeing spatial patterns, you see them 
everywhere — and you then begin to naturally make the link between pat-
terns and the possible causes and ramifications of the patterns.
 
Be careful when making interpretations of patterns. Maps that show clusters 
of tornados might tell you more about the number of people who are around 
to observe those particular tornados than it does about your weather pat-
terns. You can also be misled into making the incorrect conclusion that the 
more people in an area, the more tornados occur. The population is related to 
tornado sightings but hopefully not to the cause of tornados.

47
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
Observing uniform distributional patterns
The type of pattern that’s the easiest to observe is called uniform distribution. 
An orchard (like the one in Figure 3-4) is a classic example of a uniform distri-
bution. Each tree is spaced almost exactly the same distance from each adja-
cent tree. This type of pattern rarely occurs naturally. It’s pretty obvious that 
the pattern is driven by some form of human action — in this case, planting.
 
Figure 3-4: 
Humans

uniform dis-
tributional 
pattern in an

Seeing patterns among dissimilar features
You may see geographic features present in some places (whatever their 
spacing) and absent in others. The sizes, shapes, orientations, and juxtapo-
sitions of these features, compared to other map features, provide strong 
evidence that a spatial relationship exists between unlike features. Consider 
these examples:
 
✓ A map may show places that have wetlands and places that don’t. And 
you know that wetlands often occur in places that feature a depression 
in the landscape.
 
✓ You may notice that commercial development seems to occur in only 
selected parts of the city. In this instance, you know that many city codes 
and zoning regulations control the locations of commercial enterprises.
 
✓ You observe that a species of plant or animal shows up in one place and 
not another. Typically, plants and animals adapt to differences in the 
physical environment at various locations.

48
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
Each of these distributions indicates something about the underlying pro-
cesses (cause and effect), in the same way that random, clustered, and uni-
form spacing do (as I discuss in the preceding sections). After you recognize 
the patterns, you can start thinking about the relationships between patterns 
and associated processes and how you can exploit that knowledge.
Describing patterns with linear features
Linear features provide both locations and distributions, but because they’re 
often connected in a variety of ways, you can describe some additional pat-
terns — including connectivity, circuitry, and linkages — that you don’t find 
in other types of features.
Many linear features connect to each other in a series of pathways, like in the 
example of road networks and railroad lines. If you look at a map of the major 
highways of the United States, for example, you notice a pattern immediately. 
Some places, especially highly populated locations (such as the eastern sea-
board), have beaucoup highways with tons of connections and many ways 
of getting from one place to another. Other places, such as the Great Plains, 
have way fewer highways with much less connectivity. These different road 
systems exhibit patterns of road networks based on the number of connec-
tions, not just on the number and proximity of roads.
Some road networks and highways allow you to go around obstructions, 
rather than just through them. These networks form closed loops, or cir-
cuits, just like in an electrical circuit. When road networks have circuits, 
traffic has an alternative because it can flow around obstacles that drivers 
might want to avoid. Rail lines use circuits so that trains can more easily 
pass other approaching trains. Perhaps one of the most common forms of 
transportation circuit is the U.S. Interstate Highway bypass (or outerbelt) 
that surrounds major metropolitan regions and allows traffic to avoid the 
congested areas of the internal part of the city (see Figure 3-5). If you see a 
concentration of circuits, such as outerbelts, you can be fairly certain that 
the population is high in that location because circuits are designed to allow 
a lot of vehicles to travel around the densest part of the city where traffic is 
congested and slow.
Understanding the repeated 
sequence of shapes
You can recognize patterns when items are arranged to form a repeated 
sequence of shapes. A simple example of such a pattern is clothing that fea-
tures a pattern, such as a herringbone suit or a plaid shirt, rather than a solid 
color. Such patterns occur in linear objects on the Earth, as well.

 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps

One well-studied set of patterns has to do with how rivers and streams connect 
to form different designs. Although you can find different terms to describe 
the following types of patterns, the ideas remain the same. Figure 3-6 shows a 
thumbnail of each of the following patterns:
 
✓ Dendritic: The easiest one for me to remember is called dendritic and 
looks like the branches of a tree. These branches (called tributaries) 
go out in all directions and seem to have a mind of their own. The flat 
terrain and absence of strong rock formations allow the water to go in 
somewhat random directions.
 
✓ Radial: Another common pattern that streams take is called radial. A 
radial pattern looks like a dendritic pattern, except that all the streams 
flow outward, away from a center, like the spokes of a wheel. A radial 
pattern occurs because a hill (with its higher elevation) at the center of 
the pattern works with gravity to cause the streams to flow outward and 
downward from the top.
 
✓ Centripetal: The opposite of radial patterns, centripetal patterns occur 
when a low spot or depression affects the flow. The radial pattern is 
reversed, and the streams flow toward the center.
 
✓ Parallel: Parallel and sub-parallel streams run along the gentle slopes 
that result from either natural topography or from land manipulation 
because of road or mining construction activities.

50
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
 
✓ Trellis: Trellis stream patterns result from rock strata that’s jointed, 
exposed, and folded from geological forces acting over time. Trellis pat-
terns resemble the street patterns in neighborhoods loosely organized 
along a grid.
 
✓ Rectangular: Rectangular stream patterns show strong right-angle turns 
and are often the result of cross-cutting joints in the underlying rock. 
This pattern also occurs in some man-made neighborhoods where drain-
age ditches are strongly oriented along a grid.
 
✓ Annular: Annular stream patterns occur in areas which have a dome 
that is eroded. The erosion forms a series of circular rings that have 
fractures at right angles to the rings, and the streams are forced to flow 
in the interrupted portions of these circles. The term annular comes 
from the geometric form annulus, which is a ring.

Analyzing and Quantifying Patterns
Recognizing that patterns exist is a great start for any GIS user, especially 
the analyst. Every pattern occurs for a reason, even if the reason is a random 
one. You analyze patterns to determine whether the process that created 
them was random, clustered, or uniform (see the section, “Recognizing 
Patterns,” earlier in the chapter). When you know the processes underlying 
the pattern, you can begin to take that explanation and make predictions 
about future patterns based on your knowledge of the presence, absence, or 

51
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
intensity of that process. For example, if you notice that a portion of a crop 
isn’t doing well, you might find that the soil in that area is low in nutrients — 
perhaps because of overplanting or under-fertilization.
Knowing your geometry and patterns
To perform a useful analysis of the patterns in your map, you must recognize 
the geometry and patterns that you encounter. You need to be able to do 
three basic things with the patterns:
 
✓ Accurately describe the patterns in a way that the layperson can 
understand.
 
✓ Quantitatively compare and contrast your descriptions of the patterns 
to those of other features and feature sets.
 
✓ Analyze the quantities that you identify to determine a measure of their 
pattern or shape, and to provide a baseline for changes that might take 
place over time.
Analyzing patterns in the real world
The recognition, quantification, and analysis of 
spatial patterns together carry one important 
characteristic. They give you the power to inter-
pret what those patterns mean and what impor-
tance the patterns might have (if they have any). 
This chapter includes a few examples about the 
significance of some patterns, but the list of pat-
tern types and causes is nearly limitless:
 ✓ Wildlife specialists want to know the loca-
tions, extent, and movement of animals so 
that they can examine the natural or human 
causes of changes in animal population or 
habitat.
 ✓ Urban planners examine street patterns, 
utility patterns, urban density patterns, 
regional population changes, and patterns 
of traffic to control growth so that every-
one can move about; have heat, light, and 
water; and live apart from noisy or polluting 
industries.
 ✓ Military analysts need to understand the 
locations and distributions of troops and 
armament so that they can deploy their own 
forces effectively.
 ✓ Criminologists study distributions and con-
centrations of crime so that they can pro-
tect the public.
 ✓ Utility companies need to examine their 
distribution networks for wear and damage 
from weather and age.
 ✓ Businesses analyze the distribution and 
composition of their potential customers 
so that they can decide where to open new 
branches.
 ✓ Emergency care personnel need to know 
the connectivity of street patterns and the 
patterns of traffic at different times of day.
GIS

52
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
GIS is designed to do much of the analysis automatically. The software antici-
pates that you’ll need these types of values for future analytical techniques. 
All pattern descriptions require some basic GIS operations, however. To 
analyze patterns of numerous objects, the software needs to be able to count 
objects, determine the absolute locations of the graphical entities (the actual 
points, lines, and polygons), and measure objects and the spaces between 
them. These techniques are the same ones that you use to calculate geom-
etry and orientation (see Chapter 11 for more on these calculations).
Using GIS software for the analysis
Your GIS software knows which values you need for your analysis because 
when you put your spatial data into the computer, you tell the software 
exactly where each point is and how that point relates to the feature’s real 
position on the surface of the Earth. When you turn the software on and 
load up the database, most programs immediately retrieve all the points, 
lines, polygons, and surfaces that you put in the database and report on the 
following calculations:
 
✓ The number of points, lines, and polygons (areas) for the theme you load.
 
✓ The individual polygon areas and the total area for the theme that you 
loaded.
 
✓ The total lengths of linear objects of a particular category.
In short, the software automatically calculates much of what you need to 
describe patterns and spatial geometry.
So, what’s left for you to do? Well, the GIS can’t anticipate everything you 
might want to calculate or analyze, so you do have to make some deci-
sions. You can find so many new tools for analyzing that you may feel over-
whelmed. I try to help you through the decision-making process by reviewing 
a few common descriptive analyses in the following sections. You can find 
more advanced methods, but these simple ones are quite powerful.
Determining the type of pattern
Figure 3-7 shows the distribution of tornados in Illinois from 1950 to 1998. 
This distribution is clearly not a regular distribution. But deciding whether 
the distribution is clustered or random is a bit more difficult. Even when a 
distribution pattern visually appears to be one or the other, you need some 
way to identify the pattern for sure.

53
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
In the clustered condition, some points are closer together than others. Put 
another way, the points in the clusters have many close neighbors, whereas 
the remaining neighbor distances are much farther apart. The mathematical 
technique that the GIS uses to make this determination is called, not surpris-
ingly, the nearest neighbor statistic.
 
Figure 3-7: 
GIS can 
determine 
whether 
this tornado 
pattern is 
clustered or 
random.
 
To determine whether a pattern of points is regular, random, or clustered, 
your GIS software follows these steps:
 
1. Find the random nearest neighbor distance by dividing one by twice 
the square root of the density of points.
 
 In the tornado example, you realize when performing your analysis that 
the number of tornados for Illinois isn’t the same from one season to the 
next or from one year to the next. You need a measurement of the aver-
age nearest distance that would occur if the distribution were random. 
That measurement is based on the density (number of points per unit 
area) of the distribution, which you identify with this simple equation:
 
 Random nearest neighbor distance = 1/(2 × square root of the density)

54
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
 
 In this case, density is the number of tornados per square mile. The 
average nearest distance changes with the density but always gives you 
the nearest neighbor distance for a random pattern.
 
2. Calculate the average pair-wise nearest neighbor distance of your points.
 
 The pair-wise part of this term indicates that each point (denoting a 
tornado location) is matched with only one other point as its nearest 
neighbor. And this statistic is pretty easy to calculate. The GIS software 
finds the x- and y-coordinates for each tornado location, measures the 
distance to every other location, and determines which location is the 
nearest neighbor. After collecting this data, the program calculates the 
average of these pair-wise nearest neighbors.
 
3. Divide the calculated average pair-wise nearest neighbor distance 
by the random nearest neighbor distance to compare distances for 
randomness.
 
 After the software calculates the average pair-wise nearest distance, you 
need a way to compare the standard for random distributions with other 
types of distributions — regular and clustered. You just have to compare 
the measured nearest neighbor distance to the random distribution by 
dividing the measured (calculated in Step 2) by the random (calculated in 
Step 1).
 
4. Compare the number to 0 and 1, where 1 is perfectly random and 0 is 
perfectly clustered.
 
 Numbers larger than 1 indicate a more regular pattern.
If you calculate the mean of all the nearest neighbor distances and divide that 
number by the random nearest neighbor distance — and you get a value of 
1.0 — the measured nearest neighbor distance shows a perfectly random dis-
tribution. If the value you get is 0.0, this measurement is perfectly clustered 
(meaning as clumped together as you can get). If you get a value greater than 1, 
your distribution becomes more regular (more dispersed) as the number 
grows larger. No absolute value exists for determining perfectly regular dis-
tributions because the values you get depend on the density of points.
 
You can determine whether the values that you get from your analysis occur 
by chance or whether they’re truly meaningful, but you may want to leave that 
job for the statisticians in the crowd. You need to know only the nature of the 
distribution.
 
The nearest neighbor analysis is an effective tool for determining the pattern 
of point objects, but you can also use this analysis to evaluate the distribu-
tion of line objects, and even area and volume objects. You just need to let 
the software calculate the center of each line — or each polygon or volume 
feature — and then do the same calculation that you perform for point 
objects (for example, nearest neighbor). You use nearest neighbor statistics 
to make sure that what your eye has already told you is real and not a fig-
ment of your imagination.

55
 Chapter 3: Reading, Analyzing, and Interpreting Maps
Identifying even more patterns
Some calculations can help you identify different types of patterns. You can 
use certain techniques to determine the average direction of linear objects, 
such as tornado paths, fallen trees, boulder distributions, shelterbelts 
(protective barriers such as windbreaks), and many other objects. Without 
going into the trigonometry, it simply gives you a summary statement of the 
direction in which these events and objects occur. This calculation might, 
for example, tell you the direction of wind during storms, the movement of a 
glacier while it leaves debris behind, or the way that farmers line up planted 
trees to protect their crops from the wind.
Beyond these calculations of position and dispersion, you can find tech-
niques for calculating the connectivity or circuitry of networks, the ratios of 
streams branching, the sinuosity of streams, the isolation of forest patches, 
and many more available inside the GIS software. In most cases, you can 
find these techniques simply by knowing the appropriate terms describing 
the condition of the geographic features you wish to examine (connectivity, 
isolation, and so on) and what they mean, and then searching for them in the 
help menu. The best part is that most GIS software not only tells you how the 
commands work, but it also frequently provides short tutorials that explain 
what the statistics do.
Interpreting the Results 
and Making Decisions
Maps show many types of patterns and distributions. As you read more 
maps, you become more familiar with them and often recognize that many of 
the patterns are distinctive in their configuration, distribution, or location. 
The GIS provides you with a mathematical means to quantify and categorize 
these patterns so that you know they really exist. Although wielding such 
quantitative power is cool, you don’t use GIS just for fun unless, like me, you 
really like patterns.
Each pattern exists because of underlying forces, whether those forces 
are natural or human, random or focused, static or dynamic. After you 
become familiar with the idea of seeing and recognizing patterns for your 
own specialty, you next need to use your specialized knowledge to identify 
the reasons they exist. A process creates every pattern, and every pattern 
has an effect on the process that created it. As trees reseed themselves in 
a single plot of land, the density of trees increases. As the density of trees 
increases, the competition for space increases, and some trees die, thus 
reducing the density.

56
Part I: GIS: Geography on Steroids 
When you analyze your GIS data, follow these steps:
 
1. Recognize and acknowledge the existence of the patterns.
 
2. Analyze and verify that the patterns are real.
 
3. Identify the causes and consequences of these patterns based on your 
knowledge of the study area.
 
4. Apply this knowledge in your own profession for prediction and 
planning.
The data inside the GIS allow you to do all the steps in the preceding list 
except one. The display shows the patterns so that you can visualize them. 
The analytical techniques allow you to quantify and summarize the patterns 
for verification. Finally, the software allows you to create new scenarios and 
model the consequences of change to help you decide which of your sce-
narios works best. But the GIS can’t tell you what the functional relationships 
are. It allows you to test different ideas and make pattern comparisons, but 
you, as the expert, have to decide which factors to examine and which pat-
terns to compare. GIS is an excellent vehicle, but — like any vehicle — it’s 
only as good as the person driving it.
 
GIS specialists can’t always apply the software to effectively solve problems 
because they’re often not subject matter experts. So, subject matter special-
ists need to communicate the possible causes and consequences of patterns 
to the GIS applications developer. For example, a change in traffic patterns 
might indicate possible traffic congestion. Traffic congestion might further 
suggest a need for new road construction, which results in even more changes 
in traffic patterns.

In this part . . .
W
e live in a digital world, and that world is filled with 
all sorts of geographic features, surfaces, and dis-
tributions. In this part, I explain how getting the geography 
into digital form requires that you understand the different 
data models. You see how each model works and discover 
its impact on the way you store, retrieve, edit, and analyze 
geographic data. Dive into this part and get ready to feel 
much more comfortable with digital map data.

M
aps are complex devices that hold tons of information. Some of that 
information appears outright in the symbols, but a map imparts much 
information more subtly, almost covertly. A single shading pattern that repre-
sents the distribution of a soil type explicitly shows where the soil is located. 
But such shading patterns also tell you what soils are adjacent to other types 
of soils, the relative amounts of each soil type, and even how often the types 
occur in a single piece of land.
For another example, if your map has point symbols that represent the loca-
tions of churches, each point symbol links explicitly to a church’s absolute 
map coordinates. And when you look at a church symbol on an area map, 
you can also see a measurable distance to other churches and to potential 
churchgoers, how many churches are in the area, and their locations within 
the area’s topography. If you’re looking for the Church on the Hill, you can 
probably find it on a hill.
Maps are complex, and human map readers (like you) interpret much of the 
information that those maps contain. So, to create a GIS that has both com-
plex and useful information, you have to show the computer how to think like 
you do as a map reader.
Formulate a conceptual model (a picture in your mind) of how you plan to tell 
the computer all the information that you glean from a map. In this chapter, 
you can discover how to think very precisely about a map so that you can 
transfer that precision into your GIS projects.

60
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Helping Computers Read Maps
A traditional map shows the properties of its features as a picture, and skilled 
cartographers do a good job of drawing the picture. When you see, read, and 
interpret the map, you often recognize properties because you know what 
the symbols in the picture mean. You might easily understand that topo-
graphic contour lines are close together on a map when the slope is steep, 
and they’re farther apart when the slope is more gradual. When you see a 
church on a hill, you know that it’s on a hill and that the people have to go up 
that hill to get there.
Then, along comes a computer, which really can’t read a map at all on its 
own. To the computer, contour lines are just a graphic representation of 
numbers located in its files. It doesn’t understand that the lines represent 
elevation values. Likewise, the computer doesn’t understand the kind of 
information that you glean from the map at a glance — for example, that a 
certain symbol represents a church, that the church is on a hill, that the 
roads leading up to the church must go uphill, and that those roads connect 
to a network of other roads leading to the people who attend that church.
You have to tell the computer all this stuff by constructing a conceptual 
model. You first figure out how the map was constructed and why it was 
made that way. You determine what decisions went into selecting the map 
areas, the categories of features included, and the graphics that represent 
the features. With these details in place, you can make a model that even 
your computer will love (or, at least, understand).
Embracing the Model-Creation Process
You can’t create useful GIS projects until you have a grasp of what you want 
to produce. In other words, you start the model-creation process with the big 
picture by asking what your final product needs to be. Then, you break down, 
or decompose, the final product into the general types (themes) of maps that 
you need to use. The last stage in the process involves determining which 
aspects of each map you need to examine. This final stage actually defines 
the map elements (features and their related data) that you ultimately plan to 
combine to create your final map.
 
Each GIS project has its own map elements, and each has its own proposed 
outcome. To decide what map features you need, you can just draw a simple 
flowchart (which is what I like to do), starting with the final outcome and 
successively breaking it down into themes and individual elements. I recom-
mend that you create this flowchart without thinking about whether these 
data are available. That way, you devise the most detailed model with no 
compromises.

61
 Chapter 4: Creating a Conceptual Model
Defining Your Map’s Contents
Before you create a map, whether it’s analog (hard copy) or digital (elec-
tronic), you first need to be aware of the geography that you want to include. 
What elements you put into the maps, and what maps you put into the GIS, 
ultimately determine the effectiveness of your analysis.
Each particular subject has many kinds of geography associated with it. For 
example, you might be working with economic geography, medical geogra-
phy, transportation geography, urban geography, and physical geography — 
and literally hundreds more. Each geography relates to the types of data you 
want to use in your own projects. So, for example, suppose you’re using GIS 
to improve the productivity of your stores — you rely on these geographies 
of your area:
 
✓ The economic geography: Points out economic factors — such as aver-
age income of shoppers in your area — that apply to your stores
 
✓ The transportation geography: Gives you an understanding of the trans-
portation systems that people use to move to and from your stores
 
✓ The physical geography: Helps you understand what impact climate 
and weather have on what you sell and when
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to pick the most appropriate 
geographies and the most useful parts of those geographies to build your GIS 
and its component maps.
Choosing a theme to map
I have a very simple trick that I use to decide what map or maps I’m going 
to include in a GIS. First, like with any project, I define the final product. If 
you plan to use GIS to define pieces of land that you can use for a housing 
development, for example, your final map should show you a list, preferably 
prioritized, of possible locations for your land purchase. To outline the specifi-
cations for the content of the final map, you ask yourself these basic questions:
 
✓ How big a piece of land do you need?
 
✓ How much are you willing to pay for the land?
 
✓ What are your locational constraints? Where would you prefer the 
land to be?
 
✓ What are the legal constraints — such as zoning and ownership — for 
developing your land?
 
✓ What physical constraints on the land are you willing to accept?
 
✓ What are the infrastructure needs for this development?

62
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Your answers to the preceding questions suggest what data you need to put 
into the computer so that you can produce the final map you need:
 
✓ You need a map that includes all the known land parcels so that the soft-
ware can measure the size of each for you and find parcels that fit within 
your size requirement.
 
✓ A map that includes the current sale price of the land allows the GIS to 
find parcels of land that are in your price range.
 
✓ If you need land near hospitals, schools, the mountains, or other fea-
tures, maps for each of these features can help you measure proximity 
to them.
 
✓ Maps of zoning help you determine whether the land is zoned for residen-
tial development or whether you need to get a zoning variance to build 
there. You also want a land ownership map so that you know from whom 
you need to purchase the land, or even whether you can buy it at all.
 
✓ You can map topography, soils, vegetation, bedrock, and other physi-
cal factors, and each factor provides important information that you 
can use to decide how much land manipulation you need to perform to 
develop there.
 
✓ Maps that show availability of power, water, curb and gutter, and tele-
communications systems help you understand if you have to pay to 
have these infrastructures put in.
 
By starting at the final product, you can break the final map down into the 
individual data component that are required to construct it. In the preceding 
example, you specify the details by asking questions about what you need 
to know to buy a parcel of land for development. You then translate your 
questions into the individual mapped features that you need to answer 
those questions.
Applying the methodology 
to any GIS project
If you don’t want to purchase land, or build homes, or anything related to 
real estate, you may be wondering if the example in the preceding section 
even applies to you. What if you’re trying to locate a new store, find the best 
place to establish a wildlife preserve, determine where crime is most likely 
to occur, or predict the risk of exposure to a hazardous waste cargo spill? 
Each scenario, no matter what the subject matter, still asks some question 
about location — where features are, where they could be, and/or where they 
should be.

 Chapter 4: Creating a Conceptual Model
Most major GIS decision-making operations deal with the locations or dis-
tributions of features. Sometimes, you use GIS to describe the impact that 
existing locations or distributions have, and other times, you use it to make 
decisions about where you want or need to put things such as businesses, 
public facilities, services, research facilities, personnel, or almost anything 
you can think of that occurs on the Earth. So, whatever your application, the 
methodology applies.
 
No matter what topic you’re mapping, you can best begin by specifying what 
you want as the final product. When you know what your final map should 
consist of, you can separate and categorize its relevant parts.
Breaking down the data 
you want to include
Each of the maps you select to include in a GIS database is composed of 
preselected geographic features, and each of those features has various geo-
graphic data associated with it. In some cases, you need all the data about a 
particular feature, and in other cases, you need only a selection.
Consider the housing development example from the section “Choosing a 
theme to map,” earlier in this chapter. You might find a map of the soils in 
your development area useful, but you really don’t care about the name 
of the soil nor whether it conforms to the latest soil survey classification 
methods. You do want to know about the engineering properties of the soil, 
however. Can the soil support housing, or do you have to bring in soil from 
somewhere else? If you have to build a septic system, does the soil support 
that activity?
At this point in the model-creation process, you need to outline details of 
your project and ask the specific questions that tell you exactly what data 
you need from the thematic maps you’ve already chosen. The housing devel-
opment project involves more than just land, and you need to outline all the 
pieces to end up with a complete database for your GIS. By creating this 
outline, you break the problem into neat chunks that you can more easily 
work with.
Say that you want to find a place to locate a bird sanctuary as part of your 
housing development, so you need to find a chunk of land that meets your 
project requirements of availability, size, price, location, accessibility, and 
usability. You have the following map themes at your disposal to help you 
find the right location:

✓ Land ownership: From the land ownership map, you can extract which 
owners you need to contact after you find out whether their land is 
for sale. You may not be able to buy from certain land owners, such as 
Federal and State government agencies. So, you want to separate out pri-
vate land from public land.
 
✓ Land for sale: This map tells you which parcels of land are actually for 
sale, how big they are, and (hopefully) the price per acre. Your goal is to 
find a parcel of at least 20 acres that costs less than $2,000 per acre. And 
you want a single parcel of 20 acres, not a bunch of little parcels that 
add up to that size.
 
✓ City limits: Because you want to have people visit the sanctuary, you 
want it to be near (less than 5 miles from) town. To know how far your 
sanctuary would be from town, you need a map that shows the city limits.
 
✓ Transportation: Being close to town doesn’t help you if you have no 
transportation system. And you want people to be able to travel on two-
lane or wider roads (for example, highways). These require you have a 
transportation map so you can compare the locations of parcels to the 
locations of the roads.
 
✓ Utilities: You want to have electricity, gas, and water available at the 
bird sanctuary site. This requires a map of utilities so you know how far 
away potential land parcels are from them.
Figure 4-1 shows a flowchart of the process you go through to break down your 
project details and relate them to the information in your thematic maps. The 
final map (the bird sanctuary) is on the right, and you can see all its compo-
nents on the left. Table 4-1 also shows a breakdown of project details, with the 
questions you ask along the way to identify the data you need to select.

Verifying your data’s characteristics
The preceding sections show you how to select appropriate map themes and 
then divide those themes into the individual data components that you need 
to match project details and answer your questions. So, you’ve identified the 
data components, but you need to know a little more about how those com-
ponents are represented in a GIS as data.
Each digital thematic map is part of a larger group of digital maps that you 
use to answer your GIS question. Each map has features represented by 
points, lines, areas, and volumes that contain useful information for you. If 
you’re just starting your current GIS decision-making process, you need to 
know what data you have in the GIS database in the first place. And you also 
need to know the characteristics of those data, including
 
✓ Level of data measurement: The data measurement available in the GIS 
can be nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio. (See Chapter 3 for an explana-
tion of these data measurements.)

66
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
 
✓ The level of detail: The scale of the mapped data helps you determine 
the level of detail available (larger scale gives you greater detail) and 
how the features are represented. A feature that looks like a point on a 
small-scale map probably shows up as an area on a medium- or large-
scale map. (Check out Chapter 2 for more on the importance of scale.)
 
All the questions you ask and answer to outline the GIS data you need are spe-
cific to your own project. My basic rule of thumb is to be comprehensive with 
your questions so that you can select the best, most complete set of data pos-
sible. You can generalize from detailed data much more easily than you can 
get specifics from general data.
Converting from Map to Computer
Computers can help you map your study area and analyze those maps, but 
only if you plan carefully what data you include and how you input that data 
into the computer. When you select your map’s content, you include the spe-
cific point, line, area, and surface features that can answer your project ques-
tions. But your computer doesn’t know as much as you do about maps.
 
In GIS terms, polygon refers to area, and surface means that a feature has a 
third dimension (for example, height).
Deciding how to represent your map
Cartographers use two general data forms that translate the map into digital 
form: raster (little squares or grid cells) and vector (or points, lines, and poly-
gons). So raster data resemble a chessboard, and vector data resemble line 
drawings. Most GIS software today can handle both types of data, so don’t 
panic about which GIS software you need based on the type of data you want 
to use. Each conceptual model base (raster or vector) brings with it a unique 
set of tools, levels of accuracy, ways of modeling, and advantages and disad-
vantages, as covered in the following sections.
Picking a raster-based model
Understanding how raster-based GIS software is constructed and how the 
databases work with it is really pretty easy. This method will probably make 
perfect sense to you when you conceptualize your raster model. Before you 
know it, you’re thinking like a chess master, seeing squares everywhere and 
relating them to your next GIS move.

67
 Chapter 4: Creating a Conceptual Model
Think of raster, or grid cell, GIS like a checkerboard or chessboard. Each 
square is a single grid cell, and each grid cell represents a portion of the 
Earth. When mapping, you assume that portions of the Earth are square for 
simplicity, and the GIS software can adjust the Earth coordinates for this 
assumption.
Raster GIS represents all forms of geographic features by using square grid 
cells, each of which represents a portion of your map. You can conceptual-
ize each of these grid cells as a part of a checkerboard. The following bullets 
take you through the thought process for each feature type:
 
✓ Points: In a conceptual model of geography, points have no dimensions 
(length or width). Of course, you have to take liberties to use grid cells 
to represent dimensionless points because grid cells do have both 
length and width. If you make these grid cells really, really small, like the 
dots on a TV screen, this whole idea is a bit easier to accept.
 
 So, if you think about raster GIS as a checkerboard, a single grid cell 
is a point object (see Figure 4-2), such as a church, mosque, or syna-
gogue. Each different type of place of worship, such as churches, has a 
unique grid cell color on the raster map that’s associated with a different 
number inside the computer. So, unlike a checkerboard, you can have 
more than two colors of squares. Say that you use the number 1 to repre-
sent churches, 2 to represent mosques, and 3 to represent synagogues. 
These different types of features all have something in common — each 
represents a place of worship associated with a common theme or map 
layer. This common characteristic limits the number of different codes 
and colors that you might need for your map of point features.
 
✓ Lines: In grid cell–based GIS, a string of grid cells represents a linear 
object (such as a road, a railroad, or a walking path). This string of 
cells can be lined up orthogonally (edge to edge), diagonally (along the 
corners), or some combination, depending on how curvy the feature is. 
Line objects are considered to have only one dimension (length), even 
though they usually have some width in the real world. So, when you 
use grid cells to represent lines, you have a bit of the same problem you 
have with point features — you have to use a symbol that has area to 
represent an object that doesn’t.
 
 Just like with point features, on a raster map you use different colors or 
patterns for each line category (see Figure 4-3), and the computer asso-
ciates those colors or patterns with particular numbers. So, when you 
input these, you might have the computer program assign roads a value 
of 1, railroads a value of 2, and walking paths a value of 3. All three of 
these features share a common theme — in this case, transportation.

68
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
 
✓ Areas (polygons): The grid-cell system can easily represent areas. The 
computer symbolizes each unique area — for example, crop types 
such as corn, soybeans, and potatoes — as a single grid cell (if the 
area is small enough) or a group of grid cells, as shown in Figure 4-4. 
And these cells may be connected (contiguous) or disconnected (non-
contiguous). The size of each grid cell corresponds to a certain area of 
land. So, if a single grid cell corresponds to a land chunk that measures 
10 meters on a side, that cell represents 100 square meters (10×10 
meters) of land area.
 
 Like with point and line features, each crop type shows up on a raster 
map as grid cells that have a common color, shade, or pattern, and each 
type has a unique number associated with it inside the computer. In the 
crop example, you might use a value of 1 to represent corn, 2 for soy-
beans, and 3 for potatoes.
 
✓ Surfaces (volumes): When you’re representing surfaces or their vol-
umes, each grid cell has, in addition to length and width, a number asso-
ciated with the height or depth of the space. This number may represent 
elevation above sea level or depth to groundwater for a point at the 
center of a grid cell. In some GIS, grid-cell values even represent non-
physical surfaces, such as population density or land appraisals.
 
 Grid cells that represent surfaces have so many possible values that 
each grid cell may have its own unique number. To go along with this 
number, on a raster map, you could give each grid cell an equally unique 
color or shading pattern. But if you do, you soon find that — with so 
many different looks — you can’t really distinguish one from the other.
 
 To make the task of assigning numbers a bit easier, the GIS software usu-
ally allows you to designate surface values by groups. For example, if 
you want to represent elevation, you might have one group of grid cells 
that ranges in elevation from 0 to 1,000 feet, another group that ranges 
from 1,001 to 1,500 feet, yet another group that ranges from 1,501 to 
2,000 feet, and so on. When you display your grid cells that represent 
the range of values (like in Figure 4-5), you can actually distinguish 
among the various elevations. You have control over how you group 
values to represent surfaces, but the computer still keeps all the myriad 
original unique values intact.

Raster GIS represents points by using a single grid cell, lines by using a line of 
grid cells, areas by using a group of grid cells, and surfaces by using groups of 
grid cells that have additional unique values.
Choosing a vector-based model
In a vector-based conceptual model, representing point, line, and area fea-
tures is pretty straightforward. The vector data structure represents each 
point object by a single X and Y coordinate pair, each line by a set of two 
or more X and Y coordinate pairs, and each area by at least three lines that 
create a closed figure (the lines’ start and end points coincide to create 
closure, as shown in Figure 4-6).

Representing surfaces or volumes by using vector data is a bit more dif-
ficult than representing points, lines, and areas, but the GIS industry has a 
well-established and commonly used data structure. This data structure, the 
Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN), represents surfaces and volumes as a 
collection of non-overlapping triangles, which is very similar to the way that 
computer games model 3-D objects. The vertices (points) of each triangle 
have unique X, Y, and Z (height) values, but each group of three vertices cre-
ates a triangular plane whose surface has a unique angle and direction (as 
shown in Figure 4-7).
The neat thing about the TIN model is that you can use it to predict (inter-
polate) missing values, create cross sections through surfaces and volumes, 
draw contour lines, and create 3-D visualizations, just like its raster equiva-
lent data model (see Figure 4-5).

Weighing the benefits: 
Raster versus vector
You may wonder how you should decide whether you need raster or vector 
data (described in the preceding sections) — or both — in your GIS opera-
tion. The raster-versus-vector debate is far less important today than it was 
in the past. Most modern GIS software has both raster and vector data com-
ponents, or it can convert from one format to another. You need to deter-
mine the most important functionality, accuracy, and storage issues for the 
work you want to do when you decide on GIS software.
So, to help you make your decision, here’s my nutshell look at the differences 
between raster and vector data models:
 
✓ Raster data takes up more computer space than vector data. Space 
may not be a serious issue unless you know that you have limited com-
puter storage and can’t get any more. Raster data require that each grid 
cell have an associated value, but as few as three sets of X and Y coordi-
nate pairs can represent large areas in vector data.
 
✓ Raster is faster (computationally) than vector. With computer speed 
rapidly increasing, this speed difference might not seem a huge issue, 
but the spatial datasets that GIS use are increasing in size at an even 
faster pace. So, if you have GIS applications that involve many datasets, 
you may want to use the computationally faster raster data.
 
✓ Raster is compatible with much scanned and remotely sensed data. 
Many raster datasets, usually in the form of scanned images (aerial pho-
tography) or satellite images, are quite useful in GIS analysis. Because 
they are similar data structures, you don’t need to do a lot of data con-
version to add them to your GIS. Determine what datasets your applica-
tion needs and keep those datasets in mind when you choose your data 
structure.
 
✓ Raster is less spatially accurate than vector. A lot of people believe that 
vector data gives an accurate representation of locations in geographic 
space, but that belief isn’t entirely true. Computers can’t represent geo-
graphic space exactly because each computer’s internal computational 
accuracies vary. Computers often truncate or round up numbers, have 
single or double precision (the number of points beyond the decimal point 
that they round to), and manipulate numbers by using algorithms that do 
strange things (other than rounding) to the numbers. Even so, the spatial 
accuracy of vector is much better than that of raster, where the resolution 
(spatial dimension) of the grid cells determines accuracy. The smaller the 
grid-cell size, the more accurately it represents geographic space.

72
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
 
✓ Raster data give you more options to work with surfaces than vector 
data. Because each grid cell has a unique surface value, any measure-
ment made over the entire surface can reflect these unique values, 
whereas with vector data (the TIN model), the computer assumes that 
large parts of the surface have the same value (the triangular plane’s 
slope).
 
✓ Raster generally provides visually less desirable output (especially 
with its coarser resolution) than vector. Some map readers dislike 
maps represented as grid cells because the lines and edges do not 
appear smooth like they would in paper maps.
 
✓ Raster is more powerful for modeling than vector. One other factor, 
and an important one for the modeler, is that you can use raster data 
much more efficiently as data for modeling because it gives you far more 
options. In Chapter 18, you can examine the detail of the Map Algebra 
modeling language that was originally developed for the raster data 
model. You can use the language to perform complex processes, called 
cartographic modeling, with more than just raster data, but the language 
has far more options with raster data. The raster data model has nearly 
limitless and extremely powerful (complex and accurate) modeling 
capabilities.
 
✓ Raster is more compatible with printer output technology and less 
compatible with plotter output technology than vector. (A plotter is a 
type of printer that draws lines rather than printing a series of dots.) 
Raster and vector models in the GIS software must communicate with 
hardware for input and output. Each input and output device also has 
its own coordinate system and its own data structure (whether raster or 
vector).
 
 You can convert the data captured by most input devices — whether 
vector (as in the case of digitizers) or raster (as in the case of scanners) — 
from one to the other data model without much loss of accuracy. On the 
other hand, plotters tend to be vector based, and printers tend to be 
raster based. The compatibility of your GIS data model with that of your 
input and output devices becomes a factor in determining the quality of 
your output.

hen you read a map, you must be able to visualize what the real 
world represented by the map looks like. As a GIS analyst, you need 
an understanding that goes beyond looks because you use this symbolic 
information to analyze and combine data, and more importantly, make deci-
sions about the space that the map represents. In some cases, you lose the 
graphical elegance of a paper map in the computer version because the com-
puter emphasizes computational effectiveness over good looks.
In this chapter, I help you understand how the data models that the software 
uses work so that you understand both the limitations and the power of a GIS.
Examining Raster Models and Structure
A checkerboard represents a unit of space divided into squares upon which 
the checkers rest. Likewise, raster GIS grids (the checkerboard) are broken up 
into grid cells (the squares) upon which geographic features (plants, animals, 
houses, towns, rivers, and so on) rest. On a checkerboard, the checkers are 
like occupants of the geographic space — you can move them around in dif-
ferent places. But the checkers have to stay on the dark-colored squares and 
move between them diagonally. In other words, the checkerboard restricts 
where you can place features (checkers) and where you can move them. 
Similarly, geographic space has limitations about what can and can’t occur.

74
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
In the real world, the nature of physical features imposes rules that control 
or limit what things can or should occupy different spaces. For example, you 
can’t build houses in the middle of a river, and you can’t sail boats on dry 
land. But the real world doesn’t consist of alternating squares of water and 
land; the makeup of the Earth is much more complex than that. Figure 5-1 
shows a grid overlaid on a map that depicts a more typical distribution of 
land and water features.
 
Figure 5-1:

lay shows 
how each 
square

a portion

space.
 
Representing dimension when 
everything is square
If geographic space were exactly like a checkerboard, it would be composed 
of square areas, each containing a given category of Earth surface data. But 
real geographic space contains more than area (or polygon) features. Real 
geography has point, line, and surface (or volume) features that must also 
show up in the grid structure.
Surfaces require that the grid system represent a third dimension (and a bit 
more complexity); I discuss how the computer represents surfaces in the sec-
tion “Dealing with Surfaces,” later in this chapter. In this list, I show you how 
to represent features that have two dimensions or less by using grid cells 
(see Figure 5-2):

75
 Chapter 5: Understanding the GIS Data Models
 
✓ Points: Even though points are considered zero-dimensional objects 
that don’t take up any space, they’re still included in the raster repre-
sentation as a single grid cell.
 
✓ Lines: Features represented as lines (one-dimensional objects) are com-
posed of a string of grid cells.
 
✓ Areas: By definition, areas are two-dimensional objects, and they show 
up as groups of grid cells.
 
In raster GIS, points are single grid cells, lines are strings of grid cells, and 
areas are groups of grid cells. See Chapter 4 for a more complete discussion of 
how grids represent geographic features.

Making a quality difference 
with resolution
At first glance, representing zero- and one-dimensional objects with two-
dimensional grid cells doesn’t seem to make much sense. But the raster 
model is just a way of representing geographic space and its features to help 
you store related information in the computer.
The spatial accuracy does suffer with these grid cells, especially for points 
and lines. This data model compromises both the exact location and the 
amount of space occupied. But this limitation in spatial accuracy is the nec-
essary trade-off with the power of the raster data model for performing high-
quality geographic modeling. Given this trade-off, you have one good way to 

76
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
improve the spatial quality of grid cells — make them smaller. Like with a 
high-definition television, the smaller the dots, the higher the resolution, and 
the more accurate the representation. In raster GIS, this concept is called the 
grid cell resolution.
 
In raster GIS, the smaller the grid cell size, the finer its resolution, and the 
more accurately those cells represent the location and spatial extent of the 
geographic features.
Finding objects by coordinates
The raster coordinate system is a set of sequential numbers that identify 
the column (X) and row (Y) locations of each grid cell. The sequence usu-
ally starts with the upper-left corner of the grid and moves from left to right 
across the columns and from top to bottom down the rows (see Figure 5-3). 
This X and Y coordinate system is pretty standard, but it doesn’t preclude 
starting, for example, on the bottom left and counting up and to the right. 
In any case, all grid coordinate systems do basically the same thing — they 
locate the positions of grid cells based on columns and rows.
Because the grid-cell resolution represents real geographic space, any move-
ment from one cell to another constitutes a symbolic traverse of both dis-
tance and direction in geographic space. For example, if you set your grid-cell 
resolution at 100 meters, each grid cell is 100 meters on a side and has an 
area that you can calculate as follows:
100 × 100 = 10,000 square meters
So, if you start at the upper-left corner of a map represented this way and 
move 15 grid cells to the right, you’re in grid column 15 and grid row 1. It also 
means that you traveled 15 times the length of each grid cell (1,500 meters). 
And you can link this distance and direction directly to the geographic grid 
(latitude and longitude), which means that you traveled 1,500 meters east 
from your starting point. Likewise, if you move down a column, you can envi-
sion that you’re moving south.
This system allows you to find virtually any object by its column and row 
coordinates. And, because these column and row coordinates are linked to 
the geographic grid, you can easily relate the grid cells to specific positions 
on the Earth. More important for the GIS modeler, you can layer grids and 
relate the corresponding grid cells to each other. Using layered grids for 
modeling requires that
 
✓ All the grids represent the same portion of the Earth.
 
✓ Grids are co-registered (meaning they lie directly on top of one another).
 
✓ Each grid cell is the same size in every map layer.

77
 Chapter 5: Understanding the GIS Data Models

Columns
Rows
The really cool thing about having these grid cells co-registered is that you 
can compare lots of different features that occur in the same geographic loca-
tion but appear on different map layers. For example, you can compare the 
location of a building (on the land-use layer) with its soil (on the soil-type 
layer) and the existence of a hazardous chemical found in that soil (on the 
soil-chemistry layer), all because the locations of each set of grid cells are 
right on top of each other in the various map layers.
Finding grid cells by category
Each grid cell in a raster GIS has a unique set of X and Y coordinates, and each 
group of cells has different properties. Unlike the squares on a checkerboard, 
grid cells come in as many types as you have categories to include in your map.
Because the raster data model structures grid cells into a coordinate system, 
you can find any grid cell you want by simply determining its column and 
row location (X and Y coordinates). Because you can also assign a category 
(a particular type, class, or even value) to each grid cell, line of grid cells, or 
group of grid cells, you give yourself another way of finding them. That is, 
after you make the assignments, you can search the grid by categories, as 
well as by coordinates.
 
Raster GIS gives you the power to search the grid in two ways. You can search 
by coordinates to examine what the grid cell represents, or you can search by 
grid-cell quality to find out where grid cells with that quality are located.

78
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Working with map layers
When raster GIS was first developing, software programmers made different 
attempts to create a storage and recordkeeping system that would allow the 
user to input, store, retrieve, manipulate, compare, and output grids. Perhaps 
the most successful, called the Map Analysis Package (MAP), presents maps as 
a series of layers, each with a different name. First, you find the map layer that 
you need. You retrieve map layers by searching for the map name (the theme). 
Each map has a set of categories, each category with a unique number value 
that can be retrieved individually. These categories also have labels associ-
ated with them for display. Figure 5-4 illustrates the MAP raster data model.
The MAP data model breaks down into these components (from the most 
general to most specific):
 
✓ Theme: The major unit of retrieval. In Figure 5-4, the map themes are 
called GRID LAYER 1, GRID LAYER 2, and so on.
 
✓ Category: After you retrieve a map, you’re free to search the multiple 
categories within the map’s theme. This data model represents each of 
these descriptive attributes with a unique numerical value (for example, 
Category1 in Figure 5-4). Modern raster GIS software allows you to 
search these categories by name.
 
✓ Value: Numbers that represent the categories. You use those numbers 
to do your analysis. In other words, the computer actually retrieves, 
compares, and analyzes the numbers themselves rather than the catego-
ries they represent. A GIS locates the category values associated with 
sets of points (grid cells) by their X and Y coordinates. Having category 
values associated with grid-cell locations is essential for doing overlays 
(Chapter 16) and for using the modeling language called map algebra, 
which I describe in Chapter 17.

Linking objects and descriptions
The Map Analysis Package (MAP) data model makes it easy to find indi-
vidual categories in a single thematic grid. Its limitation is that, as originally 
designed, the MAP data model represents each category only once per layer. 
The solution is simplicity itself. For each map, you add not just categories, 
but also a database of categories by linking the map to a database manage-
ment system. The database management system can store multiple values 
for each category. So, now you can have a map of land use that includes a 
category called housing, and that category can have many different subcat-
egories. Raster software such as the Spatial Analyst that the Environmental 
Systems Research Institute (ESRI) uses currently implements this model.
 
Extending the raster data model by including a database management system 
gives you a lot more flexibility. But you need to make sure that you know 
where to look for the categories and that you give them names you can 
remember. Always use meaningful and memorable names for categories, 
ID-codes (codes you use for categories), and maps, if at all possible.
Exploring Vector Representation
To think about maps inside the computer in a graphically familiar way (think 
paper map), envision each point as a point with its own X and Y coordinates, 
each line with an ordered set of these coordinate pairs, and each polygon with 
a string of points that close (begin and end at the same place). Conceptually, 
vector GIS software both stores and displays points and lines more accurately, 
making those points and lines nearly zero- and one-dimensional, respectively, 
and having polygons more closely represent their own shape. The closer 
together the points that make up line segments, the more accurately they 
represent the real lines.
Several data models allow the conversion, storage, and manipulation of map 
data by using the vector approach. Some of these models are simple and 
work very well for input and output devices, and others are more complex 
and allow for some serious computational power.
Simple forms of vector representation
Simple forms of vector representation focus more on the accurate graphic 
depiction of features and less on the subsequent analysis of geographic infor-
mation. The simple forms still in use today are mostly for input and output, 
rather than actual GIS functionality. Modern GIS software communicates 
quite effectively with these feature-depicting models, which often come built-
in to the GIS as graphics languages.

80
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
This ability to communicate with graphics depiction models is necessary 
because even the most complex data modeling can’t happen if you can’t get 
data into the GIS software or create a map when you’re done with your analysis.
Spaghetti representation
The simplest of vector data models is the spaghetti model (see Figure 5-5), 
a one-to-one translation of graphics into the computer without regard for 
spatial relationships. Software using the spaghetti model stores points in the 
computer with identifying numbers (for example, the first point is number 1, 
the second is number 2, and so on). Each number is linked directly to its cor-
responding X and Y coordinates in a separate data table. Lines are ordered 
strings of points (the spaghetti), each associated with a searchable point 
identification number. Finally, the software stores the polygons, which also 
have searchable IDs, as closed loops of coordinate pairs.
The spaghetti model is simple, easy to understand, and (more importantly) 
fast for both input and output. It doesn’t work — meaning it doesn’t store 
information correctly — when you try to represent features such as islands 
because they’re effectively a polygon within a polygon. The data model also 
doesn’t recognize polygons comprised of non-contiguous parts, such as 
island chains. These data representation limitations make this data model 
ineffective for modeling and analysis.
Alternative representation
One vector data model created by ESRI gives much more control than the 
spaghetti model. Instead of limiting storage of points, lines, and polygons 
to coordinate pairs, this model (called a shapefile) stores the geometry of 
each feature as a shape that contains the coordinates and links to the attri-
butes. GIS software packages widely use this data model today because of 
its relatively low processing overhead, low storage requirements, fast draw-
ing speeds, and its ability to handle overlaps and non-contiguous features. 
You can also, with relative ease, convert the shapefile model to more com-
plex data models, which I describe in the section “Complex forms of Vector 
Representation,” later in this chapter.
The term shapefile is a bit misleading. A shapefile isn’t a single file. Instead, 
it’s three separate files that allow for the representation of 14 different types 
of geometric shapes (as outlined in Figure 5-6). The primary file with an .shp 
extension is a list of X and Y coordinates that define objects called shapes. 
To keep track of the shapes and search them by type, it also has an index file 
that has a file extension .shx. Finally, the .dbf (or database) file contains all 
the attributes that describe the features.
 
Although the shapefile is still a fairly simple data model, compared to some of 
the more advanced ones, it’s likely to be a GIS software mainstay data model 
for years to come because it’s simple and compatible with many software 
programs.

Complex forms of vector representation
Despite its robustness and elegance, the shapefile (see the preceding sec-
tion) lacks one thing that many high-end modelers demand — the ability to 
see spatial relationships. This characteristic, called topology (which I define 
more specifically in the next section), allows the GIS software to recognize 

82
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
and convey some basic spatial relationships that humans express by using an 
English language construct called the prepositional phrase. (Don’t worry. You 
don’t have to diagram sentences.)
In everyday language, you use many prepositional phrases that describe the 
spatial relationships you encounter. For example, you may live “outside a 
town,” “next to your neighbor,” and “within the county.” You travel roads that 
go “through forests,” “along rail lines,” and “over hills.” The data models dis-
cussed in the section “Simple forms of vector representation,” earlier in this 
chapter, don’t have these relationships (known as topological relationships) 
explicitly coded. You need to incorporate the mathematics of these relation-
ships — the topology — into the data model so that you don’t have to calcu-
late these spatial relationships each time you want to analyze something.
Using the mathematics of neighborhood
When you look at a map, you can easily see where everything represented 
on the map is relative to everything else on that map. For example, when 
you look at a map of your own neighborhood, you get an instant view of that 
neighborhood. You can see shortcuts, recognize which places are close to 
your house and which are far from your school, determine what’s on each 
side of your street, and know which streets are connected to each other and 
which aren’t. To replicate this powerful property of the human brain inside 
the computer, computer scientists employ a branch of mathematics called 
topology that studies the positions and relative locations of geometric figures. 
I like to call it the “mathematics of neighborhood” because it allows the com-
puter to understand how a neighborhood works (including what features are 
located there, where they are relative to each other, and how to find them).
Because computers can’t reason or look around at their neighborhoods, you 
have to tell them everything. And so you explain
 
✓ Each line you create is linked to other lines. If the computer under-
stands these connections, you can move from one link to another, just 
like you’d drive your car from one street to another.
 
✓ The classifications of nearby areas. Say that on the left side of a line 
(perhaps your street) is a polygon (a parcel of land) that’s agricultural, 
and on your right side is a single-family residential parcel.
The U.S. Bureau of the Census needed computers that understood the connec-
tions and classifications used in its work. This need led the bureau to develop 
two of the more well-known topological data models — the Dual Independent 
Map Encoding (DIME) and subsequent Topologically Integrated Geographical 
Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) models (discussed in the following section).
Figure 5-7 shows a generic topological vector model. All the others, including 
commercial ones, are based on this model, with minor variations. The left side of 
the figure shows several points, lines, and polygons, all of which are numbered:

83
 Chapter 5: Understanding the GIS Data Models
 
✓ Points: The numbers that have circles around them
 
✓ Lines: The numbers that interrupt the lines
 
✓ Polygons: The numbers inside the polygons
These numbers are essential because they allow the computer to know which 
part you’re referring to when you want to compare the relative locations of 
all the points, lines, and polygons.
The table at the top of Figure 5-7 contains information about the spatial rela-
tionships (the topology) of the points, lines (links), and polygons:
 
✓ Link #: Lists all the links in the figure, numbered 1 through 11.
 
✓ Right and left polygons: Tell you how the links are related to the poly-
gons on either side of them. This is the contiguity property of topology, 
which identifies the polygon on either side of any given line. By default, 
it also tells you the direction of the line because it knows which polygon 
is on the left and which polygon is on the right of that line.
 
 By default, polygon 0 is the outside polygon — the polygon that consti-
tutes the area outside of the map.
 
✓ Nodes 1 and 2: Show you which nodes (points at the end of each link) 
define the beginning and ending of each link. These nodes link links 
to other links (whew!). So, this information tells you another aspect of 
topology called connectivity — the order and sequence of links.
Because the nodes define the links, and the beginning and ending nodes of 
some links occur at the same place, these links create polygons. So, if you 
know the coordinates of all the nodes, you also know the third basic compo-
nent of topology — area. Area, as one of the basic properties of this topologi-
cal data model, simply means that the polygons are defined by identifiable 
links, the coordinates of which are stored in the computer. You have that 
necessary information in the bottom table in Figure 5-7, which shows all the 
X and Y coordinates of all the nodes for all the links.
 
Topology is a way of coding the geometry of spatial relationships inside the 
computer, and topology consists of three things:
 
✓ Contiguity: The topological property that says links have a direction, as 
well as polygons on their left and right sides.
 
✓ Connectivity: The topological property that says nodes connect links in 
a definable sequence.
 
✓ Area: The topological property that says areas (polygons) are defined 
by identifiable links.

Using the U.S. Census file types (DIME and TIGER)
The United States Bureau of the Census wanted to produce maps of its 
street, address, and associated census data for the 1980 centennial census. 
Specifically, it needed to know what was on each side of a street, and to do 
so, needed to incorporate topology. So, the Bureau created a topological 
data model that supported the census geography provided by data collected 
every ten years — the Dual Independent Map Encoding (DIME) file. DIME was 
one of the first really useful datasets that was available to the general public 
for GIS. It also greatly enhanced the ability of researchers to examine large 
segments of the population through what’s now called census geography.
DIME recognizes the three basic components of topology (contiguity, con-
nectivity, and area). The primary purpose of this model is to allow census 
data users to link the tabulated census information to census geographic 
units (such as streets, blocks, districts, and so on). The DIME model stores 
the topology by creating explicit From and To nodes that define each link for 
each map (as shown in Figure 5-8). Each of these links, like any topological 
model, includes explicit information about what’s on its left and right sides.
In Figure 5-8, the left and right sides of the link from node 21 to node 22 are 
census blocks 88 and 90; these blocks constitute polygons on a map show-
ing these census divisions. DIME files also include addresses for each side of 
each link (left and right blocks) so that the DIME model also allows the user 
to easily identify and locate census divisions inside the database.

The major drawback to the DIME file is that its geography isn’t very realistic. 
It represents a curved street, such as Lake Drive in Figure 5-8, with a straight 
line. In 1980, the Census Bureau wasn’t concerned about the accuracy of such 
features. When others began using the DIME files for implementations other 
than census tabulation, the geography became more important and was added 
to the more advanced TIGER data structure. For example, some insurance 
companies use the census files to map which houses lie within zones likely to 
be flooded every 100 years (100-year flood zones). The improved geographic 
accuracy of the TIGER files is vital for accurately locating such houses.
The DIME files are still available today, although the U.S. Census Bureau 
has replaced them with a more advanced topological structure called 
Topologically Integrated Geographical Encoding and Referencing (TIGER). 
Advantages of TIGER files over DIME files include:
 
✓ Easy retrieval: The TIGER model directly addresses points, lines, and 
polygons, so you can more easily retrieve a census block by retrieving 
the block number, rather than having to find the links first and use their 
topological information for retrieval. Figure 5-9 illustrates how the TIGER 
data model is structured.
 
✓ Improved geography: Although Lake Drive is represented as a straight 
line in DIME files (as shown in Figure 5-8), TIGER files show the actual 
shape of Lake Drive (see Figure 5-9). This feature makes TIGER files 
much more compatible with non-census-related research and other data 
files that are more geographically accurate.
TIGER files are readily available both from the U.S. Bureau of the Census and 
third-party vendors who often repackage the files. TIGER files are compat-
ible with a vast array of other data types, possess lots of data already in this 
format, and constitute an elegant implementation of the topological data 
model, so they’re likely to be around for a while.
Understanding the ESRI coverage approach
One of the early successful topological data models, the coverage model, 
developed into one of the most successful commercial GIS products of its 
time — the ArcInfo that ESRI uses. Each map layer is a single unit composed 

86
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
of geographic features associated with a common theme. Each theme covers 
the study area’s geographic extent, and a series of these themes represents a 
more comprehensive view of the content of the study area.
In a coverage, here’s how the features are stored:
 
✓ Entities: Primary features such as points, arcs (the word ESRI uses for 
lines), and polygons
 
✓ Complementary information: Secondary features such as
 
• Tics: Points that show the input device where the map 
coordinates are
 
• Links: Computer code that ties the graphics to the descriptions
 
• Annotations: The text of the descriptive information
The attribute information itself is stored in a separate set of database files.

 Chapter 5: Understanding the GIS Data Models
The coverage model supports the three major properties of topology: conti-
guity, connectivity, and area definition. The coverage model has been around 
for over two and a half decades, but most GIS software vendors still support 
it because of the large number of GIS users whose data were (or still are, in 
some cases) stored as coverages.
Working with object-oriented representations
Advances in computer languages and their associated data structures — the 
development of object-oriented programming (OOP) — brought about a useful 
adoption for GIS data models. OOP focuses on objects where an object is a set of 
computer code that can be copied from place to place in a computer program. 
In GIS, an object represents a type of geographic feature that you can move 
around and whose properties follow it (are inherited) no matter where you 
place it. Incorporating OOP languages resulted in wholesale rewriting of some 
GIS software and development of new software based entirely on this model.
Much of the power of OOP data models results from the objects’ shared 
properties, or the characteristics they have in common with other objects 
in their group. (I describe the sharing of properties briefly in the sidebar, 
“Sharing the property,” and talk more about object structure in Chapter 6.) 
Because of shared properties, an object always knows what it can and can’t 
do, and what it can and can’t support. So, you don’t have to worry about 
any surprises when you retrieve information from an object-oriented GIS. If 
you’re looking for information on a land parcel, you won’t pull data related 
to oceans because the ocean objects don’t share the properties of (and, so, 
aren’t grouped with) land parcel objects.
You can find several implementations of the object-oriented model available, 
including the ESRI Map Objects product and the GE Smallworld GIS product.
Taking on advanced geographic representations
Perhaps the most robust and advanced of the object-oriented models is the 
ESRI new geodatabase model. The geodatabase (not to be confused with a 
collection of geocoded data inside a GIS software package that’s sometimes 
referred to as a geodatabase) allows you to store a wide variety of data types 
(including raster, vector, CAD, and others) in the same system. Here’s a quick 
list of the types of data this model can incorporate:
 
✓ Attribute tables from typical RDBMS (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Geographic features that you might find in land-use maps.
 
✓ Satellite and other digital imagery such as the files you might get from 
the LANDSAT satellite.
 
✓ Surface models you could obtain from the USGS Digital Elevation 
Models (DEMs).
 
✓ Survey data from scientific vegetation samples, or telephone surveys, 
for example.

88
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
The geodatabase model, like the non-object-oriented coverage model, has 
tables of data that include objects (rows in the database table) and features 
(objects that have explicitly defined geometry). It’s a completely topological 
model, like its predecessors. What makes the geodatabase so powerful is that 
each of these objects can contain a wide array of rules and logic, which makes 
the objects more like real geographic objects. For example, if you have a 
geodatabase of electrical infrastructure, certain lines that represent a type of 
wiring don’t connect to non-compatible types of wiring because the database 
explicitly stores properties that prohibit such a dangerous connection. Or, if 
you have a road-network geodatabase, the rules might prohibit you from con-
necting a one-way street going east to another one-way street going west.
Although the geodatabase is new and quite different from its non-object-oriented 
cousins, it has a lot of tools that you can use to migrate your data to the geo-
database format. While GIS analysis becomes both more sophisticated and 
more realistic, the geodatabase and other object-oriented models like it will 
increase their capacity to represent rules and conditions that characterize 
real-world geographic features.
 
ESRI has made many industry-specific geodatabase models that contain com-
plete logic available for use, so you don’t need to build them from scratch. If 
you’re looking for a GIS for a specific application, check to see whether ESRI 
has the model you need before reinventing the wheel.
Sharing the property
In object-oriented models, geographic features 
are stored as objects. There’s debate about 
exactly what an object is, but in GIS, an individual 
object (with its local properties) also represents 
a group of objects that has a set of more global 
properties. By being part of the group, the object 
shares those global properties. So, for example, 
a land parcel object has unique identifiers — 
owners, value, size, shape, and so on — but 
it still possess a set of properties shared by a 
larger group of polygons called parcels. The par-
cels in this group share a set of conditions that 
differ only in the specifics. For example, all the 
parcel objects have a type of land use, an owner, 
and zoning restrictions. So, the general proper-
ties outlined for a parcel object (meaning that it 
has a land-use type, an owner name, and a set of 
zoning restrictions) are inherited by every other 
parcel.

89
 Chapter 5: Understanding the GIS Data Models
Dealing with Surfaces
Surfaces of all kinds are very common in GIS, but because of their three-
dimensional nature, they place additional demands on the computer pro-
grammer who wants to represent them. Beyond having to represent the 
X and Y coordinate, and the associated attributes, you also have to worry 
about how to effectively include the third dimension in such a way that the 
software can perform all the basic operations on surfaces that the other data 
types allow, such as storing, retrieving, editing, analyzing, comparing, and 
outputting.
Storing surface data in a raster model
The general raster model provides the easiest method of storing surface 
data. Each grid cell represents not just an area on the surface of the Earth, 
but also a single elevation value. So, a grid cell in column X and row Y would 
store a single value Z that represents the elevation for the entire grid cell (as 
shown in Figure 5-10).
This model does limit the accuracy of your elevation values, just like the 
raster model itself limits the locational accuracy and spatial representation 
of the actual geography (see “Making a quality difference with resolution,” 
earlier in the chapter). On the plus side, the model does allow for some very 
nice surface modeling with low computational overhead (far fewer calcula-
tions), and you can easily convert it to other forms of surface representation.

A raster

tation of

data.
 

90
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
The most common form of raster surface model is called the Digital Elevation 
Model (DEM), which was developed by the United States Geological Survey 
(USGS) to store and eventually process topographical surface data. DEMs are 
a series of regularly placed X and Y coordinate locations that also contain Z 
values, which depict the topographic elevations at those locations.
 
DEMs come in a number of different sizes, based on the maps from which they 
were derived. USGS DEMs come in 7.5-minute (meaning 7.5 minutes of latitude 
by 7.5 minutes of longitude each), 15-minute, 30-minute, and 1-degree versions. 
The 7.5-minute series provides the most elevational detail. When you move 
from 7.5 minutes to 1 degree, you lose both horizontal and vertical accuracy.
 
You can get the DEM directly from the USGS, and it’s also available from other 
vendors as a value-added product. Most modern GIS packages support the 
DEM data model, which allows you to convert the data in the model from its 
original form as a matrix of X, Y, and Z values to raster grid-cell structure, con-
tour lines, and even vector topographic data models.
Representing surfaces in a vector model
Trying to represent surfaces in vector models is a bit more complex than in 
raster models, but the basic idea for this model has been around since the 
early 1960s. Based on the idea that many parts of a surface are relatively flat, 
the programmers constructed a model that looks much like how three-dimen-
sional computer characters (avatars) are constructed.
The primary vector model that represents surfaces in the computer is called 
the Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN), shown in Figure 5-11. The words in 
the TIN’s name really explain what it does:
 
✓ Triangulated: The locations (X, Y, and Z coordinates) are created 
through a process of triangulation (a method of surveying based on the 
trigonometric properties of a triangle) and are represented as a set of 
non-overlapping triangles.
 
✓ Irregular: These triangles are irregular in shape because each repre-
sents a flat portion (facet) of the overall surface.
 
✓ Network: The triangles are joined together edge-to-edge to create a 
surface.
Each triangle is like the facet of a crystal. In this case, however, the crystal is 
a portion of the topographic surface. The three vertices (points of the trian-
gle) of each facet (non-overlapping triangle) each have X and Y coordinates, 
and each has a unique elevation value. The slope (angle from horizontal) and 
aspect (direction) are uniform and constant for each individual triangle.

TINs are topological data models, just like DIME and TIGER models presented 
earlier in this chapter, but they’re specifically designed to incorporate the Z 
value component, whether it’s topography or economic data. Like in other 
topological data models, the TIN data model contains explicit information 
about which features are related spatially to others.
The TIN model, shown in Figure 5-11, is pretty close to the model you see 
in Figure 5-7. Each model has a table of point values, and each has a set of 
polygons and links. In the case of the TIN model, the polygons are always tri-
angles, and each triangle’s vertices define it. The Triangle File table in the TIN 
model is much like the polygon table in Figure 5-7. Specifically, the Triangle 
File table shows
 
✓ The vertices that make up each triangular facet (the first three columns)
 
✓ The neighboring polygons (the second three columns)
The Point File table is different in the TIN topological model, as compared to 
the chain table in Figures 5-8 and 5-9, because it also contains the elevation 
(Z) value for each.
The TIN model has some definite positive features:
 
✓ It’s incorporated in many vector GIS packages, so it can be used immedi-
ately for surface representation.
 
✓ You can easily convert it to matrix models, such as the digital elevation 
model (DEM).
 
✓ It allows for interpolation of missing Z values by using a wide variety of 
algorithms.
 
✓ You can make cross-sectional profiles of terrain and perform many 
advanced functions related to topography.

Keeping Track of Data 
Descriptions
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how simple graphics programs store descriptions
▶ Working with database management systems
▶ Using object-oriented systems to provide more geographic reality
N
o matter what type of geographic setting or scales of geographic data 
you use in GIS, you need to link the graphics with meaningful descrip-
tive data. When you perform geographic analysis, you search, manipulate, 
compare, and analyze this data. Every GIS software package must manage 
descriptive data and link them to their respective objects on the map. 
Without this capability, your GIS is nothing more than a digital picture, and 
you may as well work with a paper map.
You can find many programs that contain both graphic elements and descrip-
tions, such as graphics drawing packages, complex drafting and design 
programs, facilities management packages, and computer-assisted mapping 
programs. These programs aren’t, technically, geographic information sys-
tems, but they may possess some of the functionality of GIS and definitely 
link data descriptions with graphics in a similar way. Getting a feel for how 
these simpler systems handle data-to-graphics linking can help you under-
stand how more complex GIS do the same thing. Consequently, this under-
standing can help you select the software that meets your needs.
In this chapter, I describe how simple software systems store descriptive 
data and link them with the appropriate graphics. I tell you what these vari-
ous systems do well (for example, computer-assisted cartography programs 
do a great job of storing geographic information and outputting maps) so 
that you can have an idea of how well the software can handle the analytical 
tasks that you have in mind. Who knows? You may decide that one of these 
simple systems fits your needs just as well as a full-blown GIS.

94
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Knowing the Simple Systems 
for Tracking Descriptions
There are many kinds of software for dealing with different forms of graphi-
cal data like house plans, satellite images, and maps. In fact, development of 
these innovative programs took place simultaneously and for different pur-
poses, as follows:
 
✓ For analyzing satellite images: People needed ways to manipulate elec-
tronic images gathered remotely from satellites orbiting the Earth. They 
began developing raster manipulation (image processing) software to 
analyze those digital images.
 
✓ For basic mapping of Earth features: Other folks were interested in 
mapping Earth’s features, so they developed raster and vector mapping 
software.
 
✓ For drafting and design work: And people involved in drafting complex 
buildings, machinery, and so on created computer-aided design (CAD) 
and drafting software.
You can still find each type of software in the preceding list available today in 
one form or another. Each software type has its specific application, and vari-
ous developers are collaborating across applications to the mutual benefit 
of all the different types of users. Because of the convergence of the different 
tasks, the properties of CAD programs have changed from their original form 
to a more GIS-like software. The descriptions in the following sections are 
somewhat simplistic, reflecting the original purpose and design of each type 
of software. When you consider your options, pay attention to the original 
conceptual design, as well as the capabilities that the software possesses in 
its current state.
Understanding computer-assisted 
cartography
Like GIS, computer-assisted cartography (CAC) was created to store, edit, 
and output maps of the Earth and — crazy as this sounds — other planets. 
CAC doesn’t have the analysis capability that’s at the heart of GIS, however. 
CAC is a straightforward process that moves from input to storage, retrieval, 
editing, and finally, output (see Figure 6-1). A CAC system just needs to store 
the attributes, or descriptive data, and have labels attached to the attributes 
so that those descriptive labels can be applied during output.

Input

Output
This simple system of linking the graphics to individual attributes makes 
CAC an efficient approach to store and output maps that have symbols and 
legends, but it limits both the amount of attribute data you can store for each 
entity and your ability to manipulate it. The usual way that such systems 
store attributes is as a list in which each attribute (description) is associated 
with individual graphic objects. For example, a graphic polygon might have 
the name Mirror Lake associated with it in the attribute list. Each map has its 
own geographic elements, called entities, and its own attributes. CAC doesn’t 
allow maps to share either their entities or their attributes with other maps 
in the same database. As a result, you can’t use CAC to overlay one map on 
another or combine their data in other ways.
CAC software allows you to translate input coordinates (such as digitizer 
inches) into scaled map data. You can also use CAC to convert from flat, 
planar coordinates to geographic coordinates, which allows you to convert 
map projections to land-based coordinate systems and vice versa. If your pur-
pose is to input, archive, update, and output maps, CAC is the system for you.
 
If you plan to use a system only for map production, computer-assisted carto-
graphic systems are both more efficient and more cost-effective than the more 
complex GIS software. CAC doesn’t have the analysis capability that’s at the 
heart of GIS, however.
Using computer-aided design
Like computer-assisted cartography, computer-aided design (CAD) isn’t 
intended to manipulate or analyze cartographic data. In fact, CAD isn’t 
intended to work with cartographic data at all — but it can. CAD systems — 
which are designed to store complex drawings in layers — store attribute 
(descriptive) data as linked lists tied explicitly to the drawing’s components 
(the entities) on a layer-by-layer basis. This layer-by-layer division means 
that the data are not shared from one layer to another.

96
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
CAD is capable of performing visual overlay because of its inherent layered 
data model — unlike CAC, CAD is structured to store multiple data descriptions 
that apply to the same entity. Many times, the graphical overlay operations 
produce graphics that help you visualize the data, but they don’t create new 
data from the various combinations of layers. GIS is designed to do so, how-
ever, which allows you to compare one map pattern to another.
Another major difference between CAC and CAD is that, generally, CAD 
doesn’t include much capability to change projection or coordinate systems. 
You can’t convert from one form of map projection to another or change 
from one coordinate system to another, for example.
 
One nice feature of CAD is that a standardized exportable version of the typi-
cal .dwg file (a common CAD drawing file), called the drawing exchange 
format (.dxf), is often easily translated from CAD to both CAC and GIS soft-
ware. In fact, many people use CAD software for input because they find the 
user interface for the input task easier to use than the GIS interface.
Exploring raster systems
The basic raster system method of handling attribute data is to store them 
as a set of ASCII characters (meaning letters and numbers), usually numbers. 
Each grid cell has a single numeric code associated with it. In most raster 
systems, the numbers are whole numbers. The code, in turn, is linked to a 
legend description (the names of the categories) and to a symbol set (the 
colors or shades used to represent the categories) for final display.
Storing attribute data in a raster system
Storing attribute data in a raster (grid) system requires that you store the 
value of each individual square based on its location in the sequence of grid 
cells. So if you are using a grid system that starts in the upper left and moves 
to the right, the first value you store would be for upper-leftmost grid cell. 
You assign the numbers (codes) based on how you define the attributes from 
the start. While the values may be actual measurements for things like eleva-
tion or slope, you may also assign numbers to represent categories, such as 
0 for water, and 6 for agriculture, and you make these decisions before you 
start putting the numbers in the database.
Suppose that you want to use the number 6 to represent agriculture. To do 
so, you place the value (code number) 6 in the first column, first row. It turns 
out the next cell in sequence is also agriculture, so you put the number 6 in 
the second column, first row. If you know that the third grid cell over (the 
third column) in the first row is water and you want to use the code of 0 for 
that, you just enter 0 in that grid cell (third column, first row).

97
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Data Descriptions
You don’t need to input these grid cell values manually anymore, but this 
example gives you an idea of how a typical GIS user would sequence them. 
You know the location of each grid cell of each type because you placed 
them where they needed to be, and you can easily retrieve the categories 
that you want based on the numbers you assigned.
 
When your GIS represents topography (the depiction of land surfaces), it 
doesn’t have to use whole numbers. Some systems use only whole numbers to 
represent the Z value, but that approach limits the accuracy of the surface 
data. Most modern GIS software allows for the more accurate use of rational 
numbers expressed as decimals. The more accurate the numbers, the better 
are the results of your analyses. Check out Chapter 14 for more about working 
with topographic surfaces.
Map modeling with grid systems
Although the raster method is pretty simple to understand, you can’t beat it 
when you want to store, analyze, and compare map attributes. Each grid cell 
for each grid layer is a uniform size and shape. Each grid layer is composed 
of identical numbers of columns and rows, in which each respective grid cell 
is positioned in exactly the same geographic (column and row) space (see 
Figure 6-2). In other words, a grid cell in the upper-left corner of one map 
layer is in exactly the same position as any other upper-left-corner grid cell 
for any other map layer.
 
Figure 6-2: 
In raster 
storage, 
you can 
compare 
each map 
layer to 
every other 
map layer.
 

98
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Because each grid cell contains attribute data, you can easily retrieve the 
data and compare it to its respective grid cell in another map layer. You use 
this property when you compare one map to another (especially when you 
use the Map Analysis Package, or MAP, data model, which I cover in Chapter 5). 
In Chapter 17, I show you how this characteristic was used to create a com-
plete GIS modeling language called map algebra.
 
Because raster grid cells are uniform in size and identically placed from one 
map layer to another, you may find them especially useful when you must per-
form map overlay operations for map analysis. Also, because the raster model 
is so simple, it makes map overlay faster than in vector systems, which usu-
ally have more complicated data structures (see the section “Managing data in 
Vector GIS” for more about these structures).
Working with Tables and Database 
Management Systems
Database management systems (DBMS) were created to manage data. As glib 
(and completely obvious) as that may sound, the idea is significant because 
DBMS weren’t originally designed to manage all types of data, and specifically, 
not spatial data. The original database management system was a separate tech-
nology that had a different clientele in mind. In the early development of GIS, 
the DBMS stored attribute data, and the graphic data were stored elsewhere.
GIS
 
Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) first fully implemented the link 
between graphics and descriptions stored in a database management system in 
its premier product called ArcInfo. The name is rather telling. Arc is the portion 
of the software suite that deals with the graphics, and Info is an existing data-
base management system that’s linked to Arc so that changes in entities (the 
graphics) are reflected in changes in attributes (the data) and vice versa.
Structuring simple relational data
At the heart of these systems is the database management system itself. 
These systems are called relational database management systems (RDBMS) 
because of their ability to form associations (relations) among the various 
data they contain. The data you search are contained in rows called tuples 
(pronounced tooples) and are grouped with corresponding rows called rela-
tions. These groupings of rows are called relations because the information 
they contain is related. Specifically, each piece of data (column) in a single 
row is related to that column’s data in the other rows because each row 
contains identical categories that can be compared to one another. Each 
column represents an attribute — such as a parcel ID or house number for an 
address book — that’s common to each tuple in the entire relation.

99
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Data Descriptions
As an example, Figure 6-3 shows a land-use table. Each row contains a 
different Parcel-ID so that all the information in that row belongs to that 
one person. Each column contains a unique type of information, and each 
individual item is linked to the name in its respective row. The relationship 
among the pieces of data in a single row is a tuple. Collectively, you call this 
a table of relations.

Each table operates like a set (for example, a set of land-parcel owners, 
together with the parcels they own and additional information about those 
parcels). These tables follow certain rules to store and, more importantly, 
retrieve data from these sets, including the following critical rules:
 
✓ A table can’t have duplicate rows. Imagine, for example, if a row rep-
resented your land holdings. You need to have the information for 
each parcel included only once. Each row in a table should represent a 
unique entry.
 
✓ A table must be searchable. Each row of data is unique, so to find a 
unique entry, you can use one or more columns (containing a specific 
type of data) to search the rows. You could, for example, search by own-
er’s last name, an ID number, or a land-use type. You can much more 
easily use a single column to search the rows of data if you set up the 
table so that you know which column you want to use. This preferred 
column — often the first column and the one you most often use to do 
your search — is called the primary key.
 
 To successfully find the right data, though, you need to make sure that 
the primary key has a value that you can search. Missing values in the 
primary key could result in duplicate rows of data (that’s a problem 
because the computer program has no way to determine which row it 
should be looking at). And even worse, if the primary key has no value, 
there is no way to connect to the remaining data in the row. It would be 
like having an address book that was missing names.

100
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
 
A good rule for database management systems is to make your tables very 
simple so that you know exactly what you’re going to search, what your pri-
mary key is, and what you expect to find. Focus on one or two queries that 
you want to make for each table. Ask yourself, “What questions do I want to be 
able to ask about the data in this table?”
Getting more complex with relational joins
Simple databases, although easier to understand and control than more com-
plex ones, aren’t going to be of any use to you if they don’t give you access 
to the large, complex datasets like the ones that you encounter in most GIS 
operations. But a relational join can help by allowing you to segment your 
database into nice bite-sized chunks that you can compare later (as shown 
in Figure 6-4). The relational join is a linking mechanism that allows you to 
match data from one table to another. You can link as many tables as you like 
by matching a column (the primary key) in one table to another column in the 
second table. The linked column in the second table is called a foreign key.

 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Data Descriptions
When you establish a relational join, all the information in the first table is 
shared with all the information in the second table, which is much easier 
than trying to make a huge, complex, comprehensive table from scratch. It’s 
much easier to design small, individual, focused tables (that can be related 
to other small ones) than to create large, unwieldy ones. Using smaller tables 
also gives you flexibility if you need to add new types of data to your data-
base. You simply add a new small table that contains a column common to 
other existing tables.
 
Relating tables with joins sounds easy, doesn’t it? Well, it is, and it also adds 
flexibility and robust search capabilities to your GIS database. But you do 
need to be sure that the tables have at least one column in common. The 
common column enables the join and allows the tables to share information.
Managing data in Vector GIS
ESRI ArcInfo is a classic model of how Vector GIS employed the power of the 
database management system to store and manage all attribute information. 
Figure 6-5 is a simple graphical description of how the system looks. One set 
of programs (the Arc side) contains the graphics portion of the database 
(the entities) and the other side (the Info side) contains the descriptions (the 
attributes).

Database management systems may look like the tables of a spreadsheet, but 
they’re actually much more complex, and they operate quite differently. For a 
system such as ArcInfo (or other Vector GIS that uses database management 
systems), the points, lines, and polygons all have descriptive information 

102
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
about them in the columns of the database management system, but they 
also have identification codes that link this information to the entities on the 
Arc side.
Figure 6-6 shows an example of a table from a recent version of ESRI ArcInfo, 
called ArcGIS version 9.X. This table includes polygon ID codes, as well as a 
lot of columns of spatial attribute data that you can use to search. The poly-
gon codes allow the software to find all the graphics (in this case, polylines) 
that are associated with them. And each code is also linked to all the other 
elements in that row so the computer can find them as well.

base table

database in

Storing data in Raster GIS
Raster GIS normally stores attribute data in the grid cells themselves. Each 
grid cell gets its own value for each layer, and you can easily locate and 
retrieve each cell using that value. But, like with Vector GIS, the need to hold 
more complex datasets and more descriptive information for each layer 
ultimately led to the incorporation of RDBMS inside Raster GIS. In a way, the 
data storage is not that much different than you find with Vector GIS, except 
that in raster, each grid cell category (rather than, for example, each poly-
gon) has a set of descriptive information.
You query data in a Raster GIS with RDBMS in the same way that you do 
with a vector system. The tables look pretty much the same, and even the 
query tool is often identical, so you don’t have to figure out a new one. This 
capability in a Raster GIS makes the computations simple and extendable to 
remotely sensed raster data. It also adds the RDBMS’s power to store and 
manage large datasets.

103
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Data Descriptions
Searching with SQL in any GIS
Modern GIS software relies heavily on the idea of storing descriptive infor-
mation in a set of tables, but not just any tables — database management 
system tables. The database management system contains a powerful set 
of query tools because, like any RDBMS, it employs the Structured Query 
Language (SQL). The database contains data organized in tables (relations), 
and the SQL searches these data.
 
SQL is a fairly standard computer language designed specifically for accessing, 
querying, and manipulating databases. It allows you to search for very specific 
information, retrieve it, delete or add to it, update it, and combine queries. 
SQL searches database tables by using commands such as Select, And, Or, 
Insert, Delete, Order By, and many more.
The following steps show how to retrieve a subset of data by using the SQL 
Select command:
 
1. Determine the subset of information that you want to retrieve from 
your GIS data.
 
 Suppose you have a table of land attributes like the following (Land_
Ownership), and you need only the information related to the land use 
and ownership categories.
Polygon ID
Land-Use 
Type
Land 
Condition
Public / 
Private
7255
Recreation
Active
Public
7721
Agriculture
Idle
Private
7246
Agriculture
Active
Private
 
2. Structure a SQL SELECT command to specify the attributes that define 
the information you want to retrieve.
 
 Because you are interested in only the land use and ownership catego-
ries, you specify those attributes and issue the following command
SELECT Land_Use_Type, Public_Private FROM Land_Ownership
 
 where Land_Use Type and Public/Private are the attribute names 
and Land Ownership is the table name.
 
 That command returns the following subset of the original table:

104
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Land-Use Type
Public / Private
Recreation
Public
Agriculture
Private
Agriculture
Private
This example returns two columns from the database and leaves the rest 
behind. This simple operation demonstrates that you can execute literally 
hundreds and thousands of other, more complex queries.
Understanding Object-Oriented Systems
An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) extends the tradi-
tional database management system so that it can model and create objects 
based on those data. Objects are collections of data and computer code that 
have two primary characteristics — inheritance (a common set of properties 
that move with them) and hierarchy (a place within larger classes of objects 
that have common properties).
By using software that has this capability, you don’t have to re-create the 
properties of some groups of data that act as objects; the object inherits 
those properties, which saves a great deal of time. This inheritance also pre-
vents you from changing properties of data arbitrarily and making mistakes 
by combining incompatible data — like putting 2-inch pipe and 8-inch pipe 
together for a sewage line.
Storing attributes with 
object-oriented systems
If you inspect a geodatabase — the ESRI application of object-oriented data-
base management systems for GIS — it looks, at first blush, pretty much like 
any other database. It has columns and rows, tuples and relations, primary 
keys, and (if necessary when primary keys are not common to two tables) 
foreign keys. In short, the user interface looks pretty much the same as any 
RDBMS-based GIS to the user. But the geodatabase’s ability to store collec-
tions of data as objects makes it different and more powerful than systems 
that lack the inheritance property of objects in object-oriented systems.

105
 Chapter 6: Keeping Track of Data Descriptions
The OODBMS has the same descriptive items that you normally find in a GIS 
implementation of the RDBMS. What gives this system its power and makes it 
a major innovation in GIS isn’t in the way it stores traditional descriptive data, 
but in that it also has a set of tables that go beyond describing the qualities of 
geographic features — what they are, how big they are, and so on — by also 
describing how those qualities translate into real geography.
Using object orientation to enhance 
descriptive information
Every geographic feature, whether it’s manmade or natural, has properties 
that affect its functionality. Superhighways have the ability to move more 
cars than two-lane roads, so superhighways are the better choice for con-
structing an interstate highway system. And some types of vegetation grow 
faster than others, so the fast-growers are often chosen for shelterbelts and 
ornamental use. These and the millions of other functional properties make 
the simple descriptions of content, color, size, shape, and so on less useful 
for decision-making. Through experience, you know how a feature’s proper-
ties affect its use and implementation.
Now, imagine you have that practical experience stored explicitly in your 
GIS tables. Experience is translated into a set of rules and behaviors that 
exist for each object (for example, each road type). The biggest advantage of 
object-oriented systems such as the ESRI geodatabase is that they add these 
behaviors to the stored objects. So, if you try to put geographic features into 
a database that violate the known behaviors of the object class they belong 
to, the software rejects them. Also, the behaviors often translate into how 
you can and can’t link different objects in your GIS.
Knowing the packaging descriptions 
for different objects
An enormous number of industries, organizations, and settings use GIS, 
which makes it an enormously powerful tool. But it also has the potential to 
be a rather large, even ungainly, piece of software because it tries to meet 
too many different user needs. The geodatabase steps in and allows for the 
creation of large, comprehensive sets of rules and conditions that largely 
depend on the types of data, conditions of use, and methods of geographic-
feature interaction specific to each set.

In RDBMS terminology, a general data model that’s modified to address the 
specific data and query needs for a given application is called a schema. So, 
for example, you might have a general schema for vegetation analysis that 
you can modify for desert vegetation. ESRI and its software users have cre-
ated an ever-increasing array of industry-specific schemas that they refer to 
as geodatabase models. ESRI intended not only to share these schemas, but 
also to use them as examples for other industries when developing their own 
schemas.
Because ESRI wanted to share the geodatabase, the institute has developed 
best practices that act as a guideline for developing these geodatabase 
models, regardless of content. These best practices indicate that each model 
should include the following:
 
✓ A case study that implements the model as an example for new users.
 
✓ An import template into which users can import their own data.
 
✓ A white paper that explains the model.
 
✓ A data-model poster that provides a graphic idea of how all the data fit 
together.
 
✓ A set of tips and tricks for new users based on the case study.
 
✓ (Optional) Web-based collaboration with other users.

These geodatabase data models can get quite complex because of the 
number of geographic features that users must consider, the properties for 
each of those features, and the potential number of rules for interaction. The 
posters that accompany many of these existing models provide an excellent 
graphical view of their operation and organization. Figure 6-7 shows a small 
portion of a poster for the water utility model from Table 6-1.

The geodatabase model and other object-oriented spatial data models are 
likely to grow in number and complexity. They add tremendous robustness 
and accuracy to an application, but using them means that you need to know 
more about your particular industry. In many applications, you can find far 
more missing relationship rules than rules that are completely understood. 
Advances in what people know about the geography that drives an industry 
can result in more complete sets of rules, as well as far better models built on 
these OO databases.

f a picture is worth a thousand words, a map is worth a million. With GIS, 
you can work with more than one map at the same time. So, GIS gives 
you many millions of words at your fingertips. Every portion of the Earth, 
whether it’s natural or man-made, is very complex. Even if you ignore for a 
minute that every portion of land has depth, you can map many possible fea-
tures, including houses, people, insects, plants, diseases, pollen, sidewalks, 
gas lines, salaries, streets, temperature, and pressure. The list is endless.
When mapped, each of these features provides a portion of the geography of 
a piece of land, and each set of similar features represents a separate theme. 
Within each theme, the explicit locations of each object, combined with the 
thousands of possible implicit spatial relationships, tells volumes. But, like 
any story, your land needs many characters — many themes. To get a com-
plete picture, you need to have many mapped layers.
ESRI provides software, lessons, and technical support for K–12 Education 
around the world as a means of encouraging spatial thinking. The K–12 educa-
tors at ESRI call the map-layering process “making an Earth sandwich.” And, 
like an Earth sandwich, a GIS works only when it has more than one layer. The 
individual layers become useful only when you can extract information from 
each and compare and contrast that different information. To make this com-
parison, the software must be capable of storing, retrieving, editing, analyzing, 
and producing new data from all layers. In this chapter, I show you how the 
various types of GIS systems do all these data management tasks.

110
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Layering Data in GIS Models
Geographers have long recognized the many types of geographic features 
and that many of these features tend to occur in similar patterns. So, for 
example, if you look at where most of the people in the world are located, 
you also see a strongly similar pattern of water sources, such as coastlines, 
lakes, springs, and rivers.
These similar patterns may or may not be related, may or may not show 
cause and effect, and may or may not occur at the same time. But they all 
definitely do one thing — they demonstrate that the more of these patterns 
you map, the better you can understand the geography.
Each GIS layer must exist as a separate searchable item that you can access 
independent of the other layers. And, at the same time, the GIS must also 
have these characteristics:
 
✓ Data segmentation: After you retrieve layers, the individual geographic 
features and the related data that make up each layer must also be read-
ily accessible.
 
✓ Data comparability: When you have access to the individual layers, 
features, and their descriptive content (categories and values), you 
must be able to compare these categories and values across any and all 
layers, and any and all content.
 
Accessibility and comparable data relationships are the heart of GIS — and 
they’re what give GIS much of its power.
In Chapter 16, I show you a set of powerful techniques that allow you to 
compare layers to one another. These techniques, collectively called overlay, 
come in many forms and require you to compare the data by using various 
methods, such as formal logic and mathematical manipulation. You use these 
techniques to create completely new layers that you can then analyze.
Comparing the Map-Handling 
Capabilities of GIS System Models
There are three basic types of system models for GIS: hybrid, integrated, 
and object-oriented. Each model type is designed to manage multiple 
layers. But each takes a fundamentally different approach to storing and 

111
 Chapter 7: Managing Multiple Maps
relating geographic data. You don’t often see the internal workings of the 
GIS, and I don’t go into unnecessary detail. You may want to choose a GIS 
software package for your organization sometime, so having a basic idea 
of how overlays work will help you in your selection process. Because how 
you work with overlay operations affects which GIS model you use, you 
need an understanding of the similarities and differences, strengths and 
weaknesses of each model to help you make the right choice.
Checking out a hybrid system model
One successful method of managing many different layers inside GIS is 
through a hybrid systems model conceived in the early 1960s during the 
development of the first operational GIS. The hybrid model structure recog-
nizes the fundamental difference between graphics features (entities) and 
their descriptions (attributes). Many of the original vector-based GIS packages 
used the hybrid model, including the original ESRI ArcInfo software. See the 
sidebar “Combine and create with ArcInfo,” in this chapter, for a bit more 
about features and attributes in this hybrid system.
What makes this model a hybrid is that the two parts — the graphics (entity) 
part and the description (attribute) part — exist entirely separately from 
each other (see Figure 7-1). When you search a hybrid system, you retrieve 
the graphics part, meaning the geographic features, separately from the data 
part (the attributes for the features), but they are connected through soft-
ware that communicates between these two parts.
 
In the original ArcInfo software, a retrieved layer was called a coverage 
because its primary function was to overlay other layers.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The hybrid 
GIS model.
 
Attribute files
Entity files

112
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
The entity files that make up the retrieved layer contain identification codes; 
feature types (point, line, or polygon); and (typically) information about 
the number of features, their measurements, and sizes, all captured during 
the input process. The entity files connect with a set of computer code — 
called links or pointers — that literally point back and forth between each 
geographic object in the entity files and its description in the attribute files. 
These attribute files are stored within the tables of a traditional relational 
database management systems (RDBMS), which I discuss in Chapter 6.
When you retrieve and overlay two layers in a hybrid system, you get a third 
layer that combines the features and data of the other two. This combination 
requires the software to “rebuild” the entity and attribute files to match the 
changed topology of the third layer. Systems that work this way are called 
topological graphics data models.
The rebuilding process that these models use compares the new entity 
records in the one set of files with the attribute records in the other and then 
reworks the data to check, correct, and rebuild topological relationships. The 
system also needs to perform this topological rebuilding when it reconfigures 
the graphics of a single layer.
Different approaches to these systems, called integrated topological models, 
perform the rebuilding operations more or less simultaneously with the 
process of overlay and other analytical operations affecting topology, which 
makes your job somewhat easier because you don’t have to wait for the 
topology to be rebuilt.
Combine and create with ArcInfo
In some ways, the ArcInfo model is similar to 
the Map Analysis Package (MAP) model cov-
ered in Chapter 5 because each layer has a 
name (for example, Vegmap or Soilmap). The 
name provides access to each layer individu-
ally. When ArcInfo was popular, the command-
line user interface addressed combinations of 
layers and their attributes through a natural 
language structure, again much like the MAP 
model. So, you could overlay layer1 onto layer2 
to get layer3.
ArcInfo, a classic example of the hybrid system 
model, was created as a topological graphics 
data model. When overlay operations com-
bine the graphics of one layer (layer1) to those 
of another (layer2), the polygons themselves 
become unique combinations of the two origi-
nals. By combining layer1 and layer2, you 
create a totally new layer3 that must also have 
its appropriate entities, attributes, and topologi-
cal structure. Layer3 now has new attributes 
that reflect the combination of layer1 and layer2 
attributes, and those attributes are assigned to 
the new layer’s features (the unique polygons).

113
 Chapter 7: Managing Multiple Maps
Eliminating pointers with 
integrated system models
Unlike hybrid systems, integrated systems treat entities, topology, and 
attributes all the same by storing them in the same sets of files. Integrated 
systems still treat each layer as a separate set of data and provide a naming 
mechanism so that they can find any layer needed. But the integrated sys-
tems don’t need links or pointers from entities to attributes because all the 
records are contained in the same RDBMS files (see Figure 7-2). Like the 
RDBMS itself, the integrated system simply connects one set of tables to 
another through relational joins.
 
Figure 7-2: 
The 
integrated

Attribute files
Entity files
Most integrated systems were originally derived from other forms of spa-
tial software that were more closely allied to facilities management and 
computer-aided manufacturing. Their original intended use was for visual 
overlay, not managing multiple maps for analytical combination. If you were 
doing facilities management, for example, you’d want to know the location of 
specific pipes, fittings, access points, joints, and electrical wires and conduits 
relative to one another. A visual overlay could show you this positioning.
 
Although integrated GIS systems weren’t originally designed for overlay opera-
tions, they’ve evolved to perform such tasks quite effectively. One major dif-
ference between integrated and hybrid systems is that integrated systems 
don’t need pointers between two sets of files. If you plan to use your GIS to 
manage many layers that have limited overlay operations, the integrated 
system is a good choice.

114
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Getting better control with 
object-oriented system models
The ESRI geodatabase model (covered in Chapter 6) is built on the hybrid 
concept (see “Checking out a hybrid system model,” earlier in this chapter) 
but possesses a unique and powerful object-oriented nature that makes han-
dling layers, whether individually or in multiples, a bit more complex during 
database building. Objects, the groups of geographic features represented in 
the database, have a unique property called inheritance, which means
 
✓ Objects can exhibit properties and rules that govern their behavior 
in your database. These properties and rules make the features you 
include in your GIS more realistic in their representation of geography.
 
✓ Any feature that belongs to an object class (a class is a group of simi-
lar objects, such as streets or land-use polygons) shares (inherits) the 
properties of the class.
 
✓ An object class can also belong to larger classes of objects that also 
share their properties. So, a group of forest polygons would share the 
properties of all forest polygons, but they would also share the proper-
ties of a larger class of polygons — vegetation polygons (see Figure 7-3).

Class properties can include unique properties, such as your naming con-
ventions, and even some unique rules of behavior. Class properties also 
prevent improper combinations through overlay and non-overlay operations 
alike. Rules prevent you from doing things such as creating GIS plans for 
building roads over rivers where no bridges exist. They protect you from 
creating mathematical inconsistencies by improperly combining layers of 

115
 Chapter 7: Managing Multiple Maps
different data measurement level, for example, by multiplying numbers that 
represent nominal categories by those representing ordinal, interval, or 
ratio scales of data measurement. (See Chapter 1 for an explanation of these 
data measurement levels.)
Having these built-in protections presumes that the governing rules exist 
somewhere in the database. Most object-oriented systems allow for a sepa-
rate set of tables that contain these specific rules and logic. In that sense, 
such systems resemble the hybrid system more than the integrated one (I 
describe both system types in the preceding two sections). The good news 
for you is that the user interface doesn’t really depend on the system model 
so you can move from using one model to using another model seamlessly.
 
If you want to have some serious control over how your map variables inter-
act (and if you know more than a bit about how the geography controls these 
interactions), an object-oriented system is your best choice because you can 
explicitly include your knowledge as rules and properties in your database.
Opting for an Object-Oriented Model
The speed and efficiency of modern computers have fundamentally altered 
the way computer systems, even large ones such as GIS, work. User inter-
faces have moved from command-line entry to graphical user interfaces; 
you can store large amounts of data on massive storage devices; and (most 
importantly) you find little difference in how programs that have different 
speeds and performance work on your system.
So, speed and efficiency don’t really play a part in your decision making, 
and choosing a system model has much more to do with what you want to 
accomplish and the nature of your analysis. These three major factors might 
help you decide on an object-oriented system model:
 
✓ How well you know your data: If your system is based on a well-known 
geography (for example, on your knowledge of how crime occurs geo-
graphically), the object-oriented model allows you to code that logic 
into your database.
 
✓ What depth of analysis you require: If you need to supply additional 
geographic rules and logics for some existing geographic features that 
you understand well, then you should use an object-oriented system 
model that allows you to include those rules.
 
✓ How you see your GIS needs evolving: Moving toward the object-ori-
ented GIS can help your system become more adaptable to innovations 
in system design that will continue to use object-oriented programming 
and database management techniques.

116
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
If your industry can use object-oriented data models (which I talk about in 
Chapter 6), take advantage of those models when you can. The vast majority 
of object-oriented data models are geodatabase models that work with ESRI 
ArcGIS software. Consult with others in your industry before you decide on a 
system.
 
Although object-oriented systems are powerful and provide a much better 
geography than simpler systems, you don’t have to use that power if you 
don’t have an immediate need for it. Many users of object-oriented GIS soft-
ware never use the full potential of the object-oriented model, just as most 
folks never use the full potential of their word-processing software. In any 
case, the model’s power is there when and if you do need it.

N
o GIS can operate without substantial amounts of quality geographic 
data, no matter how you intend to use it. You can purchase these data 
from commercial vendors, but the surest way to guarantee your GIS database 
integrity is to build it yourself or carefully supervise its construction for the 
specific task or tasks that you have in mind. You know exactly what you want 
your GIS to do and how you want it to help with your decision-making.
Because GIS offers so many possible applications, many possible types of 
data exist that you can put into the GIS. This chapter discusses a few exam-
ples in four basic data groups that you’re most likely to encounter — GPS, 
remote sensing, field data, and census data. In this chapter, I also show you 
how to work with existing maps and prepare them to be digitized.
Identifying Quality Data
The sources of GIS data, as well as their accuracies, sampling methods, and 
many other factors, affect not just the quality of a GIS database, but also 
how effectively it serves your decision-making needs. I’ve personally tried 
to build GIS databases based on over 10,000 observations of wild animals. 
Unfortunately, because the study was based on behavior, rather than move-
ment through the study area, the researchers took the vast majority of the 
samples in front of several den locations, making those samples unacceptable 

118
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
for GIS implementation. Because the researchers collected all the data at one 
spot, while the data (animals, in this case) wandered all over the study area, 
the samples don’t reflect the spatial nature of the data. I’ve had similar prob-
lems because of data that has incorrect classifications, scale problems, timeli-
ness issues, and so on.
If you want GIS to be useful for finding solutions to geographic problems, it 
needs to be appropriate (to the degree possible) in the following ways:
 
✓ Scale or resolution: How much detail do you need for your study?
 
✓ Measurement level: Do you need interval data, or are categories 
enough?
 
✓ Accuracy: How well can your measurement tool capture your data?
 
✓ Sampling method: Do you collect all the data in all the places you need?
 
✓ Timeliness: Do you work with time-sensitive data that change quickly 
and need to be collected right away?
 
✓ Data type: Are the data the appropriate data for you application, both in 
subject matter and in format? (Do you need field data or satellite data, 
for example, or do you need soil data rather than temperature data?)
 
✓ Data classification system: Do you use the same data classes as other 
layers in your database (for example, land-use classes from 1955 versus 
2005)?
 
✓ Completeness: Have you collected all the data that you need to answer 
your question?
 
Select only the best-quality and most appropriate data type for your needs. 
Collecting more data than you need and gathering data that includes irrele-
vant details add to the costs and reduce the effectiveness of the resulting GIS.
Importing Statistical and Sensory Data
To keep things simple, I’ve divided GIS data into two types: statistical and 
sensory. This division is a bit artificial. I’m defining sensory data as those data 
most commonly associated with distant sensing devices, such as the Global 
Positioning System (GPS), and various forms of imagery, including both aerial 
photography and digital satellite data. Statistical data include field data and 
census data, both of which usually rely on some form of direct contact by a 
person to collect.

119
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
Getting information from GPS data
Folks often mistake GPS for GIS, partly because the two acronyms sound so 
much alike and partly because GPS is more common as a consumer product. 
Using the advanced technology of GPS to provide highly accurate location 
data is a huge bonus when building a GIS.
GPS requires a large number of satellites orbiting the Earth (32, as of this 
writing), strategically placed base stations, and receiving equipment (shown 
in Figure 8-1). By triangulating radio signals sent from these orbiting satellites 
down to Earth, geographers and geodetic scientists can calculate the latitude 
(north-south location) and longitude (east-west location), as well as elevation 
data, for virtually any location within the satellites’ lines-of-sight.
 
Figure 8-1: 
A typical 
GPS

120
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Because GPS requires line-of-sight, it isn’t as useful for places such as the 
tropical rainforest because the trees prevent the receiver and the satellite 
from seeing each other. Even in conditions without the problems of tree 
canopy, for best results, it takes three or more satellites and some expensive 
receiving equipment (what the stores call GPS units). But even inexpensive 
receivers can yield some incredibly accurate results (see Figure 8-2).
 
GPS receivers that cost less than $100 can still give you accuracies of less 
than 10 meters, depending on the number of satellites your unit can see at 
one time.
 
Figure 8-2:

Using remote sensing to create maps
Scientists have used aerial photographs to map portions of the Earth for 
nearly 100 years, and although the technology today is mostly digital rather 
than film, it’s still available. Most of the U.S. Geological Survey’s original 
topographic maps were derived directly from observations from aerial pho-
tographs. In fact, USGS created or improved a large majority of map products 
derived before the mid-1970s by interpreting these pictures.
When satellites sense the Earth, they detect radiation values for a large grid 
of small squares covering part of the earth’s surface, much like the grid cells 
described in Chapter 4. Because these grid cells are specifically related to 
recorded imagery, they’re called picture elements — or pixels, for short. Each 

121
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
time a sensor senses an area, it records a single radiation value in a particu-
lar radiation band for each pixel. The more sensors available on a single 
satellite, the more sensor bands you pick up because each sensor looks for a 
unique part of the electromagnetic spectrum (see Figure 8-3). So, rather than 
a single set of digital values representing only one radiation band, you get 
multiple sets of values, each based on its own part of the spectrum.

Enhancing images
With layered digital images, you can work with the separate spectral (wave-
lengths of radiation) layers and decide how to put them together to get the 
exact picture you want. For example, when you take photographs with a 
digital camera, you can change the appearance of those pictures by using 
your computer (or sometimes even the camera’s software). You can change 
Grandpa’s red eyes to their original brown or get rid of that line on the image 
that resulted from a hair that fell across the lens. You adjust the picture in 
this way, called image enhancement, to make the image clearer or simply 
more understandable to image analysts.
You can use images gathered from aerial photographs as base maps (a starting 
point for more complex maps) when you’re heads-up digitizing (digitizing off 
the screen) because these photographs give a nice, relatively current picture of 
the Earth. Also, enhanced images make heads-up digitizing even easier than the 
raw images do because enhanced images allow the human eye to see things not 
visible under normal circumstances. For example, you can make lines (such as 
fences) and boundaries (between fields and pastures) stand out so they can be 
easily seen for digitizing. This sounds a bit like cheating, but it really isn’t. It’s 
a bit like what studio photographers do to create those special-effects pictures 
for weddings, graduations, and other special events.

122
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Classifying images
Scientists classify satellite images, often with the notion of putting those 
images into a GIS package. Rather than relying on the human eye to do the 
work, the computer classifies the images in two basic ways:
 
✓ Supervised classification: With supervised classification, you first iden-
tify an object you know, such as a lake. You then tell the computer to 
look at the pixels that you selected and find other pixels that have the 
same kind of spectral values (brightness values in each spectral range). 
That’s the non-technical explanation. The actual computer program is 
all about statistics, but it really just tells the computer to “find other 
stuff that looks like this selection and call that stuff a lake.”
 
✓ Unsupervised classification: If you want to be a bit more rigorous or you’re 
unfamiliar with an area, you can use unsupervised classification, in which 
the image processing software randomly picks different pixels as start-
ing points. You can include a class estimate (such as the upper and lower 
limits) of the types of features you see in an image. The software groups 
the pixels into those classes and then searches to find others like them.
 
 For example, if you want the computer to pick ten classes, you get a 
random set of pixels grouped into ten classes. Then, the computer finds 
pixels that “look” like (have the same range of pixel values) each group 
and classifies them. After you review the results, you can tweak the 
upper and lower limits of your class values as needed to capture all the 
class information you want.
 
 This approach may not pick up all your pixels the first time, or it may 
get classes confused. In general, if you put it through a few trials, it 
can find a pretty good set of classes. But it doesn’t give those classes 
names — that’s your job. Nice to know you’re needed, huh?
 
Whichever classification method you choose (supervised or unsupervised), 
you get what remote sensing scientists call an image map. And you can put 
that image map into your GIS. In fact, one of the advantages of the raster GIS is 
that its data structure is nearly identical to the data structure of these satellite 
images. Figure 8-4 shows a typical image map.
 
Figure 8-4: 
A typical

123
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
 
When you use remotely sensed images, you have access to a large number 
and different types of land-sensing satellites, so you can obtain new images 
frequently. As a way of updating GIS data, especially information such as land 
cover and land use, this type of GIS input is invaluable because it covers so 
much territory, so frequently, and at a relatively minor cost per unit area.
Collecting field data
People collected data in the field long before satellites, GPS, or even GIS 
were around. Assembling field data can involve conducting house-to-house 
surveys; collecting traffic data along roads; recording the air temperature 
and other atmospheric data; or gathering soils, vegetation, insects, or any 
number of other environmental samples. For hundreds of years, naturalists, 
anthropologists, and many others collected data about people, plants, ani-
mals, landforms, and the like, but collecting such data with the idea of subse-
quently producing maps came a bit later.
No matter what types of data you intend to collect, you generally can’t find 
and record every single instance of the features you’re examining. Imagine, 
for example, that you want to study grass in your backyard. You’re going to 
be there a very long time if you intend to collect data on every blade of grass. 
Or perhaps you want to measure the temperature everywhere in your city. 
Because temperature is continuous (it occurs in virtually every possible place 
all the time), it’s physically impossible to collect temperature everywhere. 
In each case, you’re forced to collect data from a sample of the total. For GIS, 
you need to sample geographic space (which is, by definition, continuous).
Maps represent space, so the samples that you take (spatial sampling) must 
represent that space accurately. That’s a fancy way of saying if you’re sam-
pling trees on an island, you can’t sample on just one side of the island. You 
need to sample everywhere that might possibly feature trees to get meaning-
ful results for mapping. Lack of spatial sampling is a common problem with 
many GIS databases.
 
When you take samples of data, be sure that you take samples from all sorts 
of different places — places that have different sizes, shapes, elevations, and 
climates.
By using the sampling process, you’re trying to determine the numbers, 
distributions, and locations of geographic features in different parts of your 
study area. You can sample spatial data in several ways, depending on 
whether you’re trying to collect point, line, or area data. These data can be 
grouped into the following classes, as shown in Figure 8-5:
 
✓ Clustered: Sampling focuses on areas that have a lot of features from 
which you can sample.

124
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
 
✓ Systematic: You use a specific, often regular, pattern to sample. For 
example, you sample at every meter along a line.
 
✓ Random: The sampling has no pattern at all. This approach often uses a 
computer to generate random numbers so the randomness of the sam-
ples has no human bias.
You can also stratify these samples (divide them into groups, or strata) so 
that you can do a specific portion of your sampling in each of a number of 
sub-portions of your sample area. To stratify your sample of who watches 
certain television programs in your city, you could divide the city into sub-
portions, or neighborhoods. Then, you pick a certain number (for example, 
25 people) in each neighborhood to sample randomly, systematically (for 
example, every fifth house), or clustered (such as where housing density is 
highest).

Spatial sampling can give you a much better representation of the geography. 
Whatever method you use, the key is simply to recognize that your data has a 
spatial distribution and a sampling strategy that ignores that distribution usu-
ally results in less than useful data.
Working with census data
Almost by definition, a census is a complete counting, although that’s seldom 
possible because (for a census of human population) parts of the population 
may have no address, may be purposely hiding, or may simply be missed. 
There are many types of census, including censuses of agriculture and bird 
populations, that don’t involve counting humans.

125
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
The most common type of census is the census of population. The United 
States performs a census every ten years on years ending in zero. This census 
results in the most common census products: The census DIME files and the 
subsequent TIGER files (see Chapter 5 for more on these file types), both of 
which are readily incorporated into nearly all modern GIS software. These files, 
however, are just the entities. Over the years, not only has the Census Bureau 
developed a substantial set of attributes, but it has also created an entire 
census geography used by human geographers, as well as business people, 
government bodies of all levels, and those who want to include socio-economic 
data into their own GIS activities. Many other nations have censuses, and you 
can often find their data available for input into a GIS database, as well.
 
The attributes that are linked to DIME and TIGER files are found in summary 
tape files (STF), which have been around since the old days when the data 
were stored on 9-inch magnetic tape reels. Generally, the STF contain popula-
tion demographics, including schooling, ethnicity, number of children, 
employment, income, housing, and even number of vehicles. These data are in 
map-ready form, from the 1980 census DIME files to the TIGER files used 
today. The DIME file structure is still used because the data collected for the 
1980 census are still useful and are stored in that structure. (See Chapter 5 for 
a refresher of the differences between DIME and TIGER files.) Additionally, 
with some work, you can convert earlier census figures to GIS-compatible 
forms. Details about the content of the STF are readily available from the 
Census Bureau at
www.census.gov/geo/www/index.html
Getting Existing Map Data 
into the Computer
Thousands upon thousands of hard-copy maps have yet to make it into com-
puters. You can digitize hard-copy maps in three basic ways: manual or hand 
digitizing; scanning; and heads-up digitizing from a scanned image, using 
your computer monitor. After you choose a method, you need to follow a 
process to prepare your map, decide what features are important to capture, 
verify the accuracy of what you captured, and create metadata that describes 
the captured information.
Forms of digitizing
You can choose from three basic methods of converting from analog (hard 
copy) to digital GIS data. Manual or hand digitizing is perhaps the oldest and 
still a time-honored, albeit tedious, method. Scanning involves using advanced 
versions of the technology of the modern digital camera and personal flatbed 

126
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
scanners. Finally, heads-up digitizing is an increasingly common form of input. 
The following sections give you a brief idea of how each method works, which 
can help you decide which you’re comfortable with.
Hand-digitizing data
Hand digitizing is a bit like hand washing. Some delicate things really do ben-
efit from special attention. Although many operations today have abandoned 
large-volume hand digitizing, you may find yourself in a situation in which 
you have a special map or your scanner’s inoperable, making an old-style 
digitizing tablet really helpful. In some instances, hand digitizing has become 
a lost art, but you may like to remind yourself of the old days — plus, you do 
have a lot of control over what you enter into your computer when you use 
this technology.
A digitizer is much like a mouse with an attitude, but the mouse pad also 
has a role to play. The mouse, in this case, is called a cursor or a puck, and it 
normally has a small transparent Lucite portion that sticks out. The puck has 
a nicely defined crosshair target, so you can see exactly where it’s pointing. 
A board (the tablet or table portion of the digitizer) replaces the cushioned 
mouse pad, and this board includes a very fine mesh of electrified wires that 
crisscross up and down, and right and left, at very precise distances. These 
wires are sensors that know exactly where that target on your cursor is at 
any given time. And because the board and the cursor talk to each other, the 
digitizer software can record the position of the cursor in exact millimeters 
or small portions of an inch.
Really nice large-format digitizers (like the one in Figure 8-6) have a lot of 
space on which you can place large maps. You can raise and lower the digi-
tizers, and tilt them to accommodate any user.
 
Figure 8-6: 
A large-
format

tablet.
 

127
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
A digitizer is much more than hardware, though. It also has software that allows 
your computer and its GIS software to communicate with the digitizer. The 
digitizer and the GIS need this software because the coordinate system on the 
digitizer is flat and measured only in inches and/or millimeters, so it doesn’t 
understand that the map you have is based on a scaled-down, projected version 
of the real world. (Check out Chapter 2 for more about coordinate systems.)
 
The digitizer usually has its own graphics language and hardware drivers that 
either come included with your GIS software or must be installed on your GIS. 
Not to worry — virtually all large-format digitizers are designed for all forms of 
graphics communication, including GIS. Most GIS software already contains 
the drivers for the digitizers on the market.
Scanning your map
Both scanning technology and the software that interprets the results have 
improved enormously over the past three decades. You may already own or 
use a simple scanning device, such as a copy machine or small flatbed scanner. 
Although these types of scanners are a similar technology, for most maps, you 
want to use a large-format drum scanner (like the one in Figure 8-7).
 
Figure 8-7: 
A drum 
scanner.
 
You place the map or image edge-first onto the drum inside, and the drum 
spins while a laser reads (scans) the document. Normally, the scanning soft-
ware converts the document into a raster image that your GIS software can 
easily convert to vector format. Earlier drum scanners were very expensive 
and frequently produced enough errors that data input specialists often 
found it faster and more effective to digitize most maps by hand.

128
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
Using heads-up digitizing
Because much aerial photography and even many maps have already been 
scanned as graphic images, more GIS data input specialists use those graphic 
images as a background template against which they do digitizing. You dis-
play the image on the computer monitor and then selectively isolate and 
record the locations of the image features inside the computer (as shown 
in Figure 8-8). You can most effectively do this type of digitizing when the 
graphic includes many locations for which you’ve already well established 
the accurate latitude and longitude locations.
 
Figure 8-8: 
Heads-up 
digitizing.
 
As compared with the other forms of spatial data input, heads-up digitizing is 
more direct, requires less equipment, and doesn’t require you to constantly 
relocate tic marks (little x’s that identify the corners) on the maps or aerial 
photographs that you’re inputting. I’ve also found that I can sit and input con-
siderably more comfortably than I can while standing over a digitizing tablet. 
Also, when you use heads-up digitizing, you can easily see whether you’ve 
included all the features you want because all the features you have digitized 
appear as graphic lines or points over the background image.
Heads-up digitizing does have some drawbacks. Most of those drawbacks 
result from the need to scan the raw imagery and maps to make them 
compatible as digital background for the heads-up digitizing process. With 

129
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
today’s scanners, you don’t really have to worry about this issue, especially 
when compared with the variable distortion of the imagery or paper maps 
themselves, which may occur when digitizing over multiple sessions under 
uncontrolled temperature and humidity.
Preparing your map for digitizing
When you digitize or scan a map, you have to do several things to prepare 
the map and yourself for the process. Digitizing some maps takes a very long 
time, so you can get the most accurate results by digitizing those maps in a 
series of short sessions because you will be less fatigued while you work. 
Follow these steps to get your maps ready for effective digitizing sessions:
 
1. Put your maps in the room where the digitizer does its work and leave 
them for a few days.
 
 Doing this lets the maps get used to the temperature and humidity. Yes, 
the environment does make a difference — recall all those sagging post-
ers that you’ve seen on walls that used to be stretched taught?
 
2. Remove any obstructions or marks from the map.
 
 The scanner records everything — including Spot’s hair, if it’s on the 
map. You don’t need to worry about this concern as much if you’re hand 
digitizing with a tablet, rather than scanning.
 
3. Secure the map to the tablet, if you plan to use a digitizing tablet 
instead of scanning your map.
 
 You need to tape the map to the tablet so it doesn’t move around. Use 
drafting tape, not masking tape. Masking tape will tear your map.
 
4. Mark the sequences of points, lines, and areas (polygons), that you 
plan to digitize during a given session.
 
 You can save time by picking out and marking only those features that 
you want to scan. Figure 8-9 shows a taped map with sequences of digi-
tizing locations in place on the map.
 
If you’re really serious about preserving your map, place a tight surface of 
clear acetate over it and mark the acetate so that the map itself remains 
pristine.

Deciding what to digitize
Only you can figure out what you need to digitize on your map. First, decide 
what you want out of your GIS, formally called the spatial information product 
(SIP) — meaning what you need your final map to look like. If you know what 
the final map looks like in your head, you can figure out the ingredients you 
need to make that map a reality.
This map preparation isn’t simple, but it isn’t as daunting a task as you might 
think, either. You need to decompose your project — break it into individual 
bite-sized pieces rather than trying to digitize large complex maps all at one 
time. Nearly every SIP is a composite of all or pieces of various maps. For 
example, a map showing the best location to put a new school in your town 
would be an SIP.
If you ask yourself some questions, you can get a pretty good idea of how 
a map is created. Suppose that your general question is, “What makes for 
a good school location?” Here’s the list of features a school needs and the 
related information that a map needs to show:

131
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
 
✓ A school needs a location near students. So, you need a map that 
shows where potential students live.
 
✓ A school needs a location that’s not already built up. Okay, you need a 
map of available land for sale.
 
✓ A school needs a location that’s accessible and legal. You want to posi-
tion a school near streets (so, look for a street map), where it can access 
utilities (water, sewerage, electricity, gas maps) in an area that’s zoned 
for public buildings such as schools (a zoning map), and so on.
Cleaning up after digitizing
The result of digitizing maps — getting them into your computer — is to 
create a database for your GIS to use. But during the digitizing process, some 
inaccuracies may creep in. You need to look for two general types of errors 
when deciding whether your GIS database is ready for use: entity (graphical) 
and attribute (description) errors. Here’s a list of general rules that can help 
you decide whether your database is correct (keep in mind that many of 
these rules overlap):
 
✓ All entities that you want to include are present.
 
✓ Your database contains no unnecessary features.
 
✓ All entities are in the correct location.
 
✓ All entities are the correct size and shape.
 
✓ All objects have the correct labels.
 
✓ Each polygon has exactly one label.
 
✓ All features are of the correct type.
To determine whether the database includes all the features you want 
or whether it contains unnecessary features, you often need a complete 
accounting of what you wanted to include in the first place. You prepare 
maps prior to hand digitizing so that you know exactly what you need to digi-
tize and what should be in your database when you are done. Because you 
can actually see the relationship between what you have completed digitizing 
and what you have not completed right on your computer monitor, heads-up 
digitizing has advantages over traditional digitizing methods.
Entity errors that relate to the accuracy of location and position, collectively 
called dangling nodes (dangles, for short), come in two types — undershoots 
and overshoots (see Figure 8-10). Overshoots and undershoots might cause 
your GIS to either over-report or under-report the number of polygons in 
your database, which can also make your labels inaccurate.

132
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
 
Figure 8-10:

nodes, or 
dangles.
 
Undershoot
Overshoot
Dangling Nodes
In most GIS software, digitizing modules ask you to define the nature of the 
features while you input them by assigning specific codes that indicate, for 
example, the beginning and ending of a line or polygon. If a line coded as a 
polygon fails to connect to create that polygon — if the line is a dangle — the 
software typically displays a graphic symbol indicating there is a problem.
 
In my experience, you can more easily find and correct overshoots than under-
shoots. Unless you’re Ms. or Mr. Stable, and you are very certain about exactly 
where you are digitizing, draw those lines too big, rather than too small.
Building the metadata
Some inexperienced GIS practitioners might lead you to believe that if you 
have a clean, error-free database, you’re ready to store, use, and share 
your data. Nothing can be further from the truth. I can’t tell you how often 
I’ve received databases, created with meticulous care, that still don’t really 
explain exactly what they contain, how accurate that data is, the timeliness of 
the information, what the categories mean, and so forth. I needed something 
that describes the database. What I needed, and what you need to make your 
GIS database really useful, is metadata.

133
 Chapter 8: Gathering and Digitizing Geographic Data
Metadata is data about data. It’s a complete description of the major facets 
of quality, source, and accessibility of the data that make them useful not 
only to you, but to others who might use the data after you do. In my teach-
ing, I’ve used the phrase “tracking down the wetlands fox” from a newspaper 
article I saw years ago. That article described the difficulty of sharing data-
bases when some of the layers contained multiple definitions of something as 
seemingly obvious as a wetland. Because it has different official definitions 
for different agencies, a wetlands map no longer contains distinct identifiable 
categories. Comparisons of different wetlands maps become impossible.
You can find many other examples of classification discrepencies, including 
comparisons of old soil maps with new ones, trying to link land-use patterns 
and land-cover patterns when the terms used are nearly identical for sub-
stantially different classes, and more. But these examples constitute only one 
type of metadata. The Federal Geographic Data Committee, which is respon-
sible for maintaining spatial data standards in the U.S. Government, has 
developed a list of seven basic entries for geospatial metadata:
 
✓ Identification: Defines the database name, developer, area of coverage, 
categories, themes, collection methods, and data access
 
✓ Data quality: How accurate and complete the data are, adaptability 
for application, positional accuracy, completeness, consistency, and 
sources for derived data
 
✓ Spatial data organization: Data model (Vector/Raster), number of spa-
tial objects, additional non-coordinate methods of location encoding
 
✓ Spatial reference: Latitude and longitude coordinates included, projec-
tions used, datums, parameters used for coordinate transformations
 
✓ Entity and attribute information: Specific attributes, what information 
is encoded, codes, and code definitions
 
✓ Distribution: Where and from whom to obtain the spatial data (you can 
often access and read the metadata before you actually obtain it), avail-
able formats, media type(s), online availability, and cost
 
✓ Metadata reference: Compilation date and compiler
There are many excellent examples of metadata. Here is a URL for a typical 
set from the USGS vegetation database for a portion of South Florida:
http://sofia.usgs.gov/metadata/sflwww/vegmap.html
People (often, government agencies) have created numerous online tools 
for developing metadata. You can find information about some of these 
tools at http://sco.wisc.edu/wisclinc/metatool. Today, most com-
mercial-grade GIS software includes such tools for you, so you don’t need 

134
Part II: Geography Goes Digital 
to use software and interfaces that you don’t already know. Moreover, the 
vendors recognize the need for compliance with established metadata stan-
dards, so the better companies always do their best to be both compliant 
and current. Most GIS software also includes a tool for including metadata 
with your datasets (Figure 8-11).
 
Figure 8-11: 
The 
metadata 
tool inside 
ArcGIS.
 
 
Always provide the most current, complete, and accurate metadata you can. 
By the same token, never buy data for your GIS from a vendor who doesn’t 
supply complete metadata.
If your GIS software doesn’t include a metadata tool, you may need to find a 
third-party tool if you plan to share your data with others or your data must 
comply with data standards. Although such third-party metadata tools exist, 
you may find that using one is inconvenient. Creating, saving, and linking the 
metadata is easier when the tool is integrated into your GIS software.

T
he data you put into your GIS isn’t much use to you if 
you can’t search out specific data, compile that data, 
and then analyze and interpret to make sense of it. This 
part shows you how to retrieve just the right data and 
then turn that data into the information that meets your 
needs. In this part, you find out how you can describe the 
geographic data you find both numerically and by type. 
You also see how you can order geographic features by 
their sizes and shapes, as well as by their locations — 
both in absolute and in relative terms. Searching out and 
characterizing geographic data are powerful skills that 
serve you well when you work with GIS.

G
rid-based maps indicate where geographic features are located on a 
geographic grid, how much space they occupy, and their locations 
relative to other features on the map. So, grid-based maps give you an 
extremely easy to understand way of storing spatial information.
With paper maps, you get the information you need by reading and interpret-
ing the printed map. Paper maps are limited because you can layer only so 
many geographic features onto one map before that map becomes unread-
able. For example, even though each kind of feature relates to transportation 
information, you can’t effectively show highways, waterways, railways, and 
ATC flight patterns all on one paper map. That would be one confusing map! 
You’d probably divide this kind of information onto separate maps. To work 
with more than one or two types of information, you need to gather informa-
tion from separate maps — and who wants to go through that effort?
In GIS, you can comfortably map many types of information to a geographic 
grid because all the information can be coded into a computer and selec-
tively retrieved for whatever subset of data you want. You use computer 
search and retrieval techniques to get just the information you need. The 
GIS may contain geographic information about all crops grown in the United 
States. You can retrieve just the geographic information about soybeans 
in part of Kansas, if that’s what you need. First, though, you need software 
programs that allow you to locate the features you need to find. This chapter 
gives you the rundown on the easiest, most hassle-free ways to get the infor-
mation you need from your GIS.

138
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Creating a Search Strategy
When you look for information on a map, you look for geographic objects 
and distributions that match the theme, or classification system, of the 
map. You might look for a street name on a road map, a town or state on a 
political map, a rock formation on a geological map, or a type of plant on a 
vegetation map.
On one map, you might be trying to find the boundaries of your property 
or the area that’s expected to flood during severe flood events. When you 
search for this type of information, you’re looking for point and line objects, 
as well as areas and the boundaries around those areas.
 
The level of geographic data measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio, 
and scalar levels) determines the mathematical nature of the data turned up 
by your search. For more information about geographic data measurement 
levels, see Chapter 3.
After you determine the topical, classification, and measurement constraints 
for a search, you’re ready to choose an analysis technique. GIS offers many 
complex analysis techniques, which I discuss in Part IV of this book.
GIS
 
An example of a complex analysis might include combining maps to deter-
mine the best place to put a dam based on the amount of water in a stream, 
the shape and size of the river valley, the number of people and homes that 
might be impacted, and the cost of putting the dam in at that location. The 
number of factors involved in analyzing where to put a dam requires you to 
be able to extract all sorts of information about the stream hydrology, the 
terrain, the surrounding population, and economic costs involved under 
certain conditions.
All such analyses require software that can find the geographic features used 
in the database. Complex analysis often drives the search for information. 
Complex approaches nearly always require fairly simple forms of search strat-
egy. So, whether you’re interested in complex analysis and modeling, or the 
plain vanilla results of a search, you need to understand the search process.
Locating objects on a map
When you read a map, you often need to find objects that you know exist 
somewhere in the map — you’re just not sure exactly where they’re located. 
In grid GIS, if you know the names, categories, or measurement levels of the 
object, you ask the software to find all the grid cells that share the name, 

139
 Chapter 9: Finding Information in Raster Systems 
class, or data level you seek. The software finds objects by the codes you 
use to identify them when you create the data. After you decide on a specific 
search object, you can follow these general steps to find the object and verify 
the results in most raster GIS:
 
1. Select the map layer that contains your search object.
 
 To locate all public school buildings, for example, you first select the 
map layer that corresponds to the object schools. You wouldn’t look in a 
map layer called hydrology, soils, or elevation to find the location of the 
schools. But a map layer called public buildings probably contains grid 
cells categorized as courthouse, library, civic center, and many others — 
including schools.
 
2. Specify the names, codes, measurements, and so on that identify your 
search object.
 
 Look in the data that you or someone else produced to find out the code 
used for each object when the grid layer was created. In this example, 
you would determine the code used for schools and tell the computer to 
search for that in the grid layer called public buildings.
 
3. Review the retrieved information and make sure you got what you 
searched for.
 
 The final map contains a subset of the data in the public buildings layer 
and will highlight only the cells containing the code for school buildings.
 
4. Name your new map.
 
 You get the honor of providing a new name for the map. In this case, 
you’d likely call the map schools.
Folks run searches for all sorts of reasons, and the most simple (but not nec-
essarily most common) is curiosity. You might want to know how the schools 
are distributed throughout the city. Or maybe you just want to simplify the 
map so that you can easily see individual schools without having to deal 
with all that annoying background. Most often, though, when you search for 
objects, you have a more complex question in mind. You may want to search 
for schools because you want to know where they’re located relative to other 
features, such as housing, so that you can buy a home near a public school.
 
People almost always have features or distributions other than simple loca-
tion in mind when they perform a search in GIS. For example, you might look 
on a map for the location of your home, but you really want to find out 
whether you live within the same school district as a particular elementary 
school you want your children to attend.

140
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Searching for linear features
Linear features are common search items. Among the most common linear 
features are roads and other transportation routes, such as rail lines. In grid 
GIS, these features appear as a series of connected grid cells within a trans-
portation layer. Within that layer, you might be looking for just the Interstate 
Highway system in the United States or the Great Siberian Railroad within 
Russia.
You may be searching for these features to find the shortest route from one 
place to another, which requires the software to determine which roads 
would suit that search. Or you may want to know which roads allow hazard-
ous cargo so that you can perform a later analysis of populations at risk. The 
software finds these linear features the same way it finds point objects — by 
the codes you use to identify them.
Searching for areas and distributions
You may want to search for areas in a GIS, such as large cities, counties, 
states, farmlands, or industrial areas. Or perhaps you want to determine dis-
tributions of birds and other wildlife, vegetation, disease, religions, popula-
tion types, natural resource deposits, or literally thousands of other features. 
In fact, Roger Tomlinson developed the first GIS mainly to map resource dis-
tributions.
Searching for polygons (areas and distributions) in a GIS helps you determine 
how much of your specified search subject exists (which can be important 
information), but your search results can provide other insights, as well. For 
example, you may want to know if
 
✓ Distributions are growing or shrinking. You may need to know the 
location of the current distribution of the imported fire ant or the 
Africanized bee in the United States and how that distribution changes 
over time.
 
✓ Changes in distribution might affect other point, line, and area fea-
tures. With information on the scope and movement of exotic (and often 
troublesome) species, you could prepare for their migration into areas 
that they don’t currently occupy.
 
✓ Existing conditions might affect your future plans. You may want to 
know the locations of areas zoned for business so that you can make 
decisions about where to start a new business.

141
 Chapter 9: Finding Information in Raster Systems 
 
The example in the first two bullets of the preceding list show that time can be 
a factor in your search. So, if time is coded into your database through layers 
derived from different time periods, you can search for locations and distribu-
tions that satisfy the time attribute code just as easily as any other code.
In a grid-based GIS, areas are comprised of groups of grid cells that share 
common code numbers. So, like with point and line features, the software 
begins by searching in the appropriate layer. Then, it identifies the groups of 
grid cells based on how you formulate your search for the existing codes.
Using the Software to Perform a Search
In raster GIS, you most often search by actually finding the categories within 
each layer rather than identifying the features as objects (for example, poly-
gons or lines). You can search with your software’s query tools by making 
selections that pick out categories in each grid layer. And so, you most often 
search for the attributes contained in each layer by using a menu system 
rather than by finding the objects on the map itself.
You can also search for objects (for example, a group of cells representing a 
category you’re interested in) on the map by pointing at the cells themselves. 
But when you do, your search retrieves all the data for those cells and not 
just the particular category data you may be looking for.
Searching in simple raster systems
In simple raster systems, you look for grid cells to find collections of cells 
representing points, lines, or areas. The type of search strategy involves 
selecting the categories that you want to work with within each layer. This 
selection process is simple, and you often make selections by using a data-
base query tool like the pull-down menu system shown in Figure 9-1. 
The graphical search allows you to define a focused study area (sometimes 
called an area of interest) right on the map, and it captures the features 
associated within other map layers and produces a new layer. When you 
select an area of interest, the software doesn’t separate out different cat-
egories, but instead picks up everything that is contained in your area of 
interest. If you want to find individual categories by using the map, you can 
point to grid cells within each area you see (check out Figure 9-2), and the 
GIS provides you with the grid cell’s location and descriptive information 
about the category it represents.

142
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
After you retrieve data from your search, you can decide to rename or reclas-
sify it using the same user interface you used to locate it in the first place 
(see Figure 9-3). This multi-purpose interface gives you the power to pick and 
choose what you want to see and control how it’s grouped together.
 
Attribute searches in simple grid-based systems find the codes associated 
with each category or class of data directly. Because no DBMS tables are 
associated with these grids, the search is simple and often obvious because 
the categories and classes of data for each map show up in the legend. So by 
looking at the legend, you can easily see all the information that’s available 
(none of the attributes are hidden).

Searching DBMS-supported raster systems
Raster systems that have associated database management systems (DBMS) 
allow the same approach as vector systems to finding points, lines, and poly-
gons. You can still perform searches based on spatial query, graphic, dimen-
sion, data type, and attributes. You can do dimensional searches in these 
more advanced grid-based systems because they have an associated DBMS, 
which you need for this approach.
 
The primary difference between the database supported type of system and 
the older, more basic grid-based systems is that the software can store and 
manage far more complex and detailed categories. The attributes aren’t lim-
ited by what the map legend can easily display. So, the attribute search is 
much more powerful with these systems than with their earlier counterparts.
For example, say that you have a forest map in a simple grid system. It 
contains a set of forest types, each of which appears in the map legend. 
The more advanced DBMS-supported system could have a set of supporting 
attribute information (such as age structure, fire frequency, fuel buildup, 
disease or infestation condition, treatment, estimated board feet, and so 
on) associated with each forest type. This association removes the need 
to have a new map for each of these categories. And now you can search 
for pine trees (a basic category in your forest map) that are known to have 
pine park beetle infestation and haven’t been treated, which saves you from 
having to perform three separate searches and then combine them.

144
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Counting and Tabulating 
the Search Results
After you find objects and distributions by using your available query language 
or interface, you want to get some numbers associated with those objects 
and distributions — and fast. This tabulation allows you to count numbers 
of objects, lengths of road, areas of distributions, and even volumes of land. 
To count the number of point objects, you need only count the number of 
grid cells. I deal more with measuring geographic objects and distributions in 
Chapter 11 and 12, but many of these basic counts are displayed without any 
need for advanced searches that you might want to perform later if you are 
interested in tabulating complex measurements.
So, with these advanced searches, you can also tabulate and summarize 
sizes, lengths, areas, circumferences, and other types of measurable data. In 
fact, most grid-based systems often report some of these numbers immedi-
ately upon completing a search.
Getting simple statistics
Among the most powerful basic tools of the GIS is its ability to tabulate the 
numbers you collect and provide you with descriptive statistics. These 
descriptions include maximum and minimum values for a search, measures of 
central tendency (the mean, median, and mode), and measures of dispersion 
or difference around the measure of central tendency (e.g. standard deviation).
So, beyond collecting and tabulating the number of towns that you find in a 
search, you can determine which of the towns is the largest and which is the 
smallest. If you have this information, you know the range of sizes (a mea-
sure of dispersion) and can rearrange, compare, and otherwise analyze your 
results. You can 
 
✓ Sort these statistics or group them by size categories, as well. 
 
✓ Derive basic statistics — such as mean, median, or mode — that give 
comparative measures with larger and smaller towns. 
 
✓ Look at measures of dispersion — such as standard deviation or other 
statistical measures — that show how much variation exists from the 
measure of central tendency. 
You don’t need to know the details of basic descriptive statistics, but profes-
sional GIS software typically offers basic, as well as more advanced statistical 
techniques. Of course, you can use these techniques only if you have attribute 
data for the entities represented by the grid cells you select.

145
 Chapter 9: Finding Information in Raster Systems 
Interpreting the results
After you collect, tabulate, and prepare summary statistics for your data, you 
get to decide what you want to do with the information. Descriptive statistics 
communicate what the data tell you in such a way that you don’t have to be a 
GIS expert, or even a map reading expert, to understand. 
You can often most usefully present the results of your queries and summa-
tions by using graphs and charts. When you include graphs and charts, they 
may be most effective when you present them right on the map itself (but not 
all software does this automatically). The combination of graphs and charts 
with an output map (see Figure 9-4) allows you to point to features on the 
map that are associated with the summaries.
 
Figure 9-4: 
A bar 
graph from 
a raster 
GIS layer.
 
 
When displayed next to your map output, or on the map itself, the statistics 
have a geographic component. Big features aren’t just big — they’re big in a 
particular place, which communicates the importance of space and place to 
your audience. In other words, this type of presentation can often enhance 
your ability to communicate all your ideas. And the better able you are to 
communicate, the more effective you are in your position. So, GIS makes you 
look good.

Finding Features in Vector Systems
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at vector GIS structure
▶ Searching with two basic strategies
▶ Summing up what you find
▶ Making sense of the data retrieved
T
he most graphically accurate method of representing maps in a GIS is 
the vector system (which I describe in Chapter 4). Vector systems rep-
resent geographic space by using a series of points, lines, and polygons. 
This method differs from raster GIS, in which geographic space is stored as a 
collection of squares called grid cells. Because data storage differs between 
raster and vector systems, the way you search for those data also differs.
Not to worry. In some ways, how you find geographic objects in a vector GIS 
is more like how you find them on paper maps. Vector GIS allows you to work 
with geographic features in a more realistic way than you can in raster sys-
tems because the points, lines, and polygons are more realistically located 
and correctly sized. For example
 
✓ Point objects: Such as wells and houses display like they don’t take up 
huge chunks of space (or an entire grid cell).
 
✓ Lines: Have the appropriate lengths but aren’t so thick that they’re 
unrealistic.
 
✓ Polygons: Represent the boundaries of areas much more exactly than 
grid cells and don’t have that blocky, checkerboard appearance.
Some books include lists of advantages and disadvantages of vector over 
raster GIS, but I prefer to think of these items simply as differences. Vector 
GIS is different in the ways it stores data (see Chapter 4), lets you retrieve 
data, and displays the results of data analysis. In this chapter, I tell you about 
the retrieval of data, and I concentrate on the differences only in the way that 
they affect retrieval.

148
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Getting Explicit with Vector Data
On paper maps, you read the symbols that represent features to identify 
those features visually. In vector GIS, you use the power of the computer to 
identify the stored features by name or description. You usually need to find 
features on maps so that you can use them in more complex tasks, such as 
finding routes from place to place, comparing different maps, and finding the 
best place to put a business. (GIS can lead you to business success by help-
ing you evaluate potential markets. I talk about some of these exciting appli-
cations in Chapter 1.)
Unlike raster systems, vector GIS systems have location information that’s 
more accurate and visually more like the real world, so you can search geo-
graphic space to achieve more accurate results. You can search by looking at 
the tabular information or by selecting the graphics on the screen. Typically, 
the software has its own graphical user interface (GUI) that enables you to do 
these searches (see Figure 10-1).
 
Figure 10-1: 
The ESRI 
ArcGIS 
vector 
GIS user 
interface.
 
From your perspective, this approach to finding features might appear pretty 
much the same as in raster systems because you don’t really need to know 
what’s going on inside the computer. The differences show up in certain 
types of analysis — particularly those involving measurement of distance, 
direction, perimeter, area, and so on — and are often an automatic result of 
the data retrieval process.

149
 Chapter 10: Finding Features in Vector Systems
Seeing How Data Structure 
Affects Retrieval
Like grid-based GIS (those that divide geographic space into little squares 
called grid cells), polygon-based GIS also comes in different flavors. These 
flavors are often not so much a function of the user interface, but rather 
how the computer goes about retrieving the data you ask it to retrieve. The 
three major types of systems are network, relational database management 
system (RDBMS), and object-oriented GIS (see Chapter 6 for details on these 
systems). In the following list, I describe the two systems that you’re most 
likely to encounter in your GIS work (I purposely ignore the network systems 
because they’re pretty rare):
 
✓ DBMS-based vector GIS: In this traditional structure, you use some 
on-screen graphics to pick out features for retrieval, or you use a 
search engine query to find the features’ attributes. The graphics link 
to the tabular data containing the attributes in the DBMS, and the two 
elements (graphics and tables) work together to supply you with data 
that satisfies your search. When you find the attributes, you get the 
associated graphics, and when you find the graphics, you also pull 
up the tabular data. Your searches enable you to combine data and 
link features together in any way you want so that you can create 
new maps.
GIS
 
 One example of a DBMS-based GIS is Intergraph’s GeoMedia package. 
Emergency services and military applications often use this software 
package to plan routes and determine the placement of troops and 
equipment.
 
✓ Object-oriented vector GIS: For object-oriented systems, you use 
pretty much the same search strategy you would in the traditional 
DBMS system. But the object-oriented system is somewhat smarter 
about how it retrieves the data. In an object-oriented system, each 
object represents a geographic feature and is associated with not only 
descriptive attributes, but also a set of rules about how the objects 
relate to each other and to their environment. In object-oriented sys-
tems, such properties (the attributes) and methods (the rules) belong 
to a grouping of objects called a class. Any object that’s part of the 
class group is said to inherit these properties and methods. In short, 
the rules prevent you from making mistakes by retrieving and linking 
incompatible objects.

150
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
GIS
 
Here’s a classic illustration of how object-oriented systems can assist you in 
retrieving valid and useful information. Suppose you’re the Director of 
Transportation Planning for the City of Barstow, and you have a new develop-
ment coming in. You know this new development needs roads, and you 
include the following interaction with the GIS in your planning process:
 
1. You establish criteria and assign an assistant to create a proposed set 
of roads and streets for the new subdivision inside the GIS.
 
 The network of new streets must be able to handle a certain flow of 
traffic (number of cars), must be accessible by all the future homeown-
ers, and must comply with the usual traffic rules. You also remind the 
assistant that this road network must link to the existing roads.
 
2. Your assistant searches the map of the development area with queries 
designed to match all the criteria for new roads to be placed in the 
new subdivision.
 
 Here the assistant tries to find where links to existing roads should be, 
where roads need to connect to new subdivisions, and what traffic laws 
might exist. Then the assistant produces a new map, and adds addi-
tional roads that are meant to satisfy these criteria, including a few one-
way streets that allow traffic to flow from north to south only.
 
3. You look at the assistant’s map and review the new street pattern.
 
 Here’s what you find in the new development’s street map:
 
• From a GIS with a traditional RDBMS structure: You point out 
that the new one-way streets (with traffic flow from north to south) 
are connected to one-way streets that flow from south to north in 
the developed part of the city. Because the traditional DBMS does 
not contain rules that prevent such mistakes, your assistant has 
been able to place streets with connecting roads that flow in oppo-
site directions.
 
• From an object-oriented GIS structure: You see street patterns 
showing traffic flow that follows the proper direction of one-way 
streets. If your assistant had used an object-oriented structure, 
no matter how hard he or she tried, the system would not have 
allowed the two opposite street patterns (north to south and south 
to north) to merge — because doing so violates the rules con-
tained in the objects themselves (the streets). Figure 10-2 shows 
a traffic route that skirts a bad road connection on the way to its 
destination.
 
If you’re often concerned about how certain data types that you retrieve will 
work together, choose a GIS package that has the object-oriented data model. 
This model’s structure validates the proper relationship of the data during 
retrieval and helps ensure that your combinations work together to produce 
legitimate results.

Deciding How to Search the Systems
You can search for information in a GIS in many ways: You can grab a set 
of graphics from the screen, search by neighborhood characteristics and 
adjacency, or look for a particular data type. Because this chapter discusses 
the vector data model, I focus on the most important ways that you typically 
search for geographic objects in a vector GIS, as follows:
 
✓ Search by attributes, using the SQL interface. You can search for any 
attribute that you want, as long as the attribute is included in the data-
base. For example, you can search a forest layer for areas infested with 
Dutch elm disease or the pine bark beetle. You can search a census layer 
for census tracts containing households that have a particular level of 
family income. Or you can search a transportation map for dirt roads. 
Basically, you can search any characteristic — size, color, variety, value, 
category, length, area, condition . . . you name it — that has an associated 
attribute stored in the database (or that the software can calculate from 
the database). If the information is in your database, the GIS can find it.
 
 SQL (Structured Query Language) is the computer language used to 
formulate database queries based on logical or mathematical search 
operators. Polygon-based GIS packages rely heavily on this form of 
search strategy, even more than the grid-based systems do. Check out 
Chapter 9 for more about SQL.
 
✓ Search for features by using the graphics interface. For example, you 
might see on-screen a set of features that you want to work with. You 
can use your cursor to draw a box around those features to select them.

152
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Targeting the right data source
 
You need to identify three search criteria before you start a search (in 
either a raster or vector GIS) to help you make sure that you’re looking in 
the right place:
 
✓ Theme or topic: The search for individual features is first directed to 
the layer that contains data for that theme. For example, a search for 
geological features such as mesas requires you to use the geology layer.
 
✓ Classification system: Knowing what classification systems identify 
the information you need can help you decide what specific classes to 
search. If, for example, you’re looking for land to use for commercial 
development, you can find that information in a layer that uses the 
zoning classification system.
 
✓ Level of measurement: The level of measurement determines what 
search values can find the data you want. For example, if you want to 
search for land-use codes (nominal data stored as integers), you prob-
ably don’t want to search for values of 9.3044211 (interval or ratio data) 
because the codes are not rational numbers.
Keeping the expected result in mind
In Chapter 9, I talk about how a search can drive analysis. Briefly, this concept 
involves planning your search so that you target the right data source (as 
discussed in the preceding section), look for the right criteria, and properly 
analyze the result. (See Chapter 9 for more explanation of the process.)
 
Follow these steps to work within the search-drives-analysis concept:
 
1. Define your question in geographic terms.
 
2. Decide on the spatial features that you need to work with.
 
3. Formulate your search based on your data needs.
 
4. Conduct your search.
 
5. Prepare to analyze the results.
Locating Specific Features with SQL
You’ll probably often want to search for specific point, line, or area features 
with your GIS. You might want to find specific types of trees (such as oaks) in 
a layer of trees, or you might want to find a set of slopes that range from 15 

153
 Chapter 10: Finding Features in Vector Systems
to 45 degrees in an elevation layer. The theme (for example, forests or eleva-
tion) directs you to the right layer, the classification limits what categories 
(such as oaks or slope) the software can effectively search, and the level of 
measurement determines the types of numerical data you find.
In the following sections, I outline how to use vector GIS to find specific fea-
tures by using the SQL search engine. Each attribute search you perform — 
whether for points, lines, or polygons — follows the same procedure. I use 
ArcGIS for the examples, but any vector GIS should work pretty much the 
same way.
Getting to the point(s)
Perhaps you’re interested in the population statistics for the African con-
tinent, so you use the GIS data you just happen to have (okay, the data I 
happen to have) that shows the countries and cities of Africa. The data 
includes statistics on population both for countries and cities, so you know 
you have the right data source. You first want to know a little about the 
cities of Africa, and you start the search process to look for point features 
(the cities).
Follow these basic steps to perform any attribute-based search by using the 
SQL tool of your GIS:
 
1. Open your database.
 
 I load up my GIS and, using the ArcGIS user interface, pull up Africa on 
my screen. The data layers are active (which means they automatically 
display on-screen). In Figure 10-3, you can see that the countries and the 
major cities are already appearing. I can tell that the geographic features 
I want to examine are already available.
 
2. Highlight the theme you want to search.
 
 In this example, I want to look at the city data, so I highlight the City 
theme.
 
3. (Optional) Open the attribute table for that theme to examine the data.
 
 This process step is optional, but it helps you double check that the 
tables really contain data or determine what data you might want to 
search. Use it with your GIS searches — if you’re choosy like me and 
want to know for sure that the data exist. This lets you spread your 
wings a bit and let the GIS software help you sort through data to see 
what’s there.
 
 In ArcGIS, I right-click the theme so that the table containing the attri-
butes appears. I see some pretty impressive sets of numbers there (see 
Figure 10-4). Your software may have a different way of viewing the 
tabular data.

154
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
 
4. Open the query tool.
 
 The search tool within ArcGIS has its own built-in SQL language. I open 
the search tool by choosing Selection➪Select by Attributes. This cool 
tool, shown in Figure 10-5, does two things that are pretty standard for 
GIS SQL tools:
 
• It lists all the categories of data in the database (so that you don’t 
have to know all the categories).
 
• It enables users to formulate a search strategy based on their 
criteria.
 
5. Formulate the query.
 
 In this step, SQL jumps in to help. The interface you use may have 
drop-down lists to select from, check boxes to select, and so on. In this 
instance, I want to see only those African cities that have a population 
I specify. When I select the criteria, the ArcGIS software actually repro-
duces what I type and puts it in a little box at the bottom of my screen.
 
6. Apply the query.
 
 Your software may have a button to click to apply the query. In the 
ArcGIS software, I simply click the Apply button to apply the query. And 
after I do, the cities I selected based on my criteria are highlighted in the 
table, as shown in Figure 10-6.
 
Figure 10-3: 
This map 
of Africa

country 
outlines and

7. View the results.
 
 Your GIS may show the query results on the map immediately after you 
apply the query. Or you may have to do an extra step, such as perform 
a map retrieval or map display operation, to see them. After I apply the 

156
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
query in ArcGIS, I can remove the table from view by either moving it 
aside or clicking the Close button. Then, all the cities I selected appear 
highlighted on the map, as shown in Figure 10-7. Because the map and 
the table are connected, what I select and highlight in the table is also 
selected and highlighted in the map.

157
 Chapter 10: Finding Features in Vector Systems
You can perform this type of search for other features (such as lines and 
polygons) in the GIS, as well. With the database from the preceding example, 
you might do a quick analysis of country (rather than city) populations for 
African nations. After clearing all the point search selections, you could 
follow pretty much the same process to search for polygons (the countries) 
as in the example with points (the cities).
Suppose you want to see all countries in Africa that have a population of 
8,000,000 or more. In the ArcGIS, you highlight the Countries theme (select-
ing the map from which you want to search for your population attributes), 
and then open your table. Next, use the selection or search tool to create a 
query that searches the Countries theme for countries that have a population 
of 8,000,000 or more. Apply the search. The countries satisfying your criteria 
are highlighted on the table, and the map also highlights the selected coun-
tries (see Figure 10-8).

are high-
lighted both

and on

Keeping your searches
You can create some really cool layers just by searching for data and then, 
displaying what you find. And, you save and copy them in case you want to 
use them again. Each software package works a bit differently, but all enable 
you to save to the database the layers you create with your searches. For 
example, some programs use a Save button that has a picture (such as an 
image of a floppy disk); others use drop-down lists; and so on.

158
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
To copy the layers you create in the ArcGIS software, follow these steps:
 
1. Find your layer in the list on the left of the screen.
 
2. Right-click the layer name.
 
 A pop-up menu appears. One of the menu options enables you to save 
the layer as a new layer (a copy, if you like). Here’s where you have 
some control over your ability to find the right layers in the future. If 
you call your creation Mylayer, that might be an accurate name, but it 
doesn’t really tell you much about the layer you created. What happens 
after you create ten layers and name them Mylayer01, Mylayer02, up to 
Mylayer10? The numbers don’t even hint at the layers’ content, and so 
the names don’t help you find the right layer when you return next week 
to review your work.
 
3. Select Save as Layer from the pop-up menu, select a folder to hold 
your layer, and type a descriptive name when prompted.
 
Developing a naming convention for your layers, even the intermediate steps 
you’ll eventually get rid of, can help you keep track of them. Make the names 
descriptive of either the layer’s thematic content (for example, oaktrees 
developed from a search of a layer called trees), or the its potential use (such 
as interimslopes for a data layer of all slopes between 15 and 45 degrees that 
you’ll tweak and eventually rename as a new layer called goodslopes).
What’s my line?
Although both raster and vector systems can represent lines, the vector data 
models are much better at displaying lines’ one-dimensional nature. More 
important to you, lines on maps represent features such as transportation 
networks. These networks allow you to model the movement of transporta-
tion vehicles, such as cars and trains. Companies use routing programs to 
plan routes for the delivery of mail and packages. GIS can track GPS-enabled 
UPS and FedEx trucks along their routes and efficiently direct nearby trucks 
to on-demand pickup locations. In fact, most goods and services will eventu-
ally travel along some form of ground transportation network that’s deter-
mined or monitored by some form of GIS.
Also, GIS helps with other important tasks related to entities that show up as 
lines on maps. For example
 
✓ Finding the fastest route for a firetruck to get to a fire
 
✓ Determining where a bus needs to go to pick up the most students
 
✓ Finding out the amount of water flowing through sections of a river or 
stream (another entity easily represented by a line on a map)

159
 Chapter 10: Finding Features in Vector Systems
 
✓ Estimating how much and what kinds of vegetation might occur near a 
river or stream as determined by the amount of water available.
 
✓ Evaluating the size of a waterway to determine whether boats can navi-
gate the river
Before you can model transportation or examine the ecology of streams, you 
need to be able to retrieve and access the pieces of the network and the tabu-
lar data that are linked to those features. The selection and retrieval process 
is easy. In fact, the preceding sections show you how to retrieve population 
data (a human-related feature) by using points (African cities) and polygons 
(African countries). Follow these steps to retrieve line data, rather than point 
or polygon data:
 
1. Open your database.
 
 For my search, I use the map of Africa and its associated attributes 
(which I discuss in the preceding sections).
 
2. Highlight the theme that you want to search.
 
 I want to know which of the many rivers in Africa are navigable because 
I want to move some equipment along the rivers for my scientist friends. 
To find the navigable rivers, I choose the theme called Rivers.
 
3. (Optional) Open the table for that theme to examine the data.
 
 I might take a peek at the tables to make sure the attribute I’m looking 
for is in them. In this example, the attribute I need is Navigable.
 
4. Open the query tool.
 
5. Formulate the query.
 
 I use my SQL search engine from the selection tool menu and create a 
search that looks for all rivers that are listed as Navigable.
 
6. Apply the query by clicking the Search button and using the Select by 
Attribute menu.
 
7. View the results.
 
 The table highlights the features I want. In my example, the navigable 
rivers show up as thicker lines and correspond to the highlighted rows 
in the table (Figure 10-9).
You can find all sorts of points, lines, and polygons just by letting the SQL 
search engine rummage through your tables to find just what you want. 
The location of your study area doesn’t matter. As long as you have a GIS 
system that has points, lines, and polygons — and the correct associated 
attributes — you can find the data you’re looking for.

Searching Vector Systems 
using Geography
In Chapter 9, I describe some successful strategies for finding geographic fea-
tures and distributions. Two of those methods — graphic- and location-based 
searches — are often combined in vector GIS.
You might assume that the primary purpose of GIS’s computer map display 
is for output, but making that assumption does a huge disservice both to the 
software and to you. If, as the examples in the preceding sections demon-
strate, the tabular data that you used SQL to retrieve are explicitly linked to 
the graphic display, then you must be able to search the tables by starting 
with the graphic.
I can use the graphic interface to find things in my favorite Africa database 
(which I use in the preceding sections). Suppose I want to study the African 
countries for which I have data on major cities. Visually, I can see these 
countries because each country that has a major city is visible. But I want 
to create a map that highlights those countries, and I want tabular data for 
some later analysis.

161
 Chapter 10: Finding Features in Vector Systems
The process for finding information spatially in the ArcGIS is actually a bit 
simpler than using the search-by-attributes method. Because the graphical 
interface offers many selection options, you don’t need to select a layer. 
Remember, your system may have a different user interface with different 
menus and buttons, but the concept is the same. Follow these steps to search 
your data using graphics:
 
1. Choose the Select by Location tool or menu.
 
 In my example, I chose Selection➪Select by Location.
 
2. Select the relative location you want to search.
 
 For example, select Adjacent to, Within a Distance of, and so on.
 
 In my example, I’m going to look for all countries that have data for 
major cities. To do this graphically, I select the Contain option, so the 
search will find the country polygons that have data points in them 
associated with large cities.
 
3. Run the Select by Location tool.
 
4. View the result.
 
 The software finds all the polygons that have major cities in them and 
highlights them on the map. And because the map is linked to the 
graphic, the data in the tables are also selected. Depending on your soft-
ware, you may have to choose from a menu or click a button to toggle 
the map or the table on or off.
 
5. Repeat these steps to perform another search.
You can find more about search strategies in Chapter 9.
Counting, Tabulation, and 
Summary Statistics
This chapter contains several examples of how to search vector systems 
to find the features and distributions you’re looking for. In each case, you 
have the choice to display the results as a map, a table, or both. The nice 
thing about retrieving table data is that you can manipulate this data like you 
can in any database. You can sort, group, and perform calculations on the 
table data by selecting the available options built right into your software, 
much like your favorite spreadsheet. Usually, the default settings are quite 
adequate for the first look, but when you begin to ask more questions, more 
manipulations allow you to get a better idea of the scope and meaning of 
your selected data. The following list gives you some examples:

162
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
 
✓ Counting: The tables allow you to count the number of items in each 
column so that you know the total number of items included in the table. 
For example, I can count the number of countries in my Africa database.
 
✓ Tabulation: Like you can in spreadsheet programs, you can sort the 
entire table contents by any column. And you can sort each column in 
either ascending or descending fashion. Suppose that you want to list 
African cities from highest to lowest population. You can sort the entire 
table or just the content that your search selected. By simply rearrang-
ing the content — without any numerical manipulation — you can exam-
ine your data in any order you want and compare one column against 
another. In many cases, this comparison leads to even more ideas for 
future comparisons and analysis.
 
✓ Summary statistics: A natural extension of counting and tabulating data 
is the calculation of summary statistics. Most GIS software allows you to 
easily create summaries. With a button click or two, the ArcGIS options 
provide the basic summary statistics — minimum, maximum, sum, 
mean, and standard deviation. These numbers cover all the basic stats 
you need to decide whether you may find the numbers useful for further 
analysis. You can
 
• Look at the relationships between highest- and lowest-populated 
countries.
 
• Determine whether the mean is a good summary statistic for 
national population in Africa.
 
• Compare each nation’s population to the total for the entire 
continent.
 
 And here’s the best part: You hardly have to do anything to get these 
numbers.
Validating the Results
When you search for something in a GIS, you most often have some idea of 
what you want to do with it. The results from a simple search are rarely the 
same as they would be for a detailed analysis. Still, you can do a few things 
when you finish a search to interpret whether you did your job correctly. Ask 
yourself these questions:
 
✓ Did I get the correct data? This doesn’t mean did you get roads when 
you wanted rivers. If you search for rivers, but only navigable ones, 
make sure the rivers that show up are coded as Navigable. Choosing the 
wrong attribute can happen, and that causes mistakes, so check that 
your results returned what you think you asked for.

163
 Chapter 10: Finding Features in Vector Systems
 
 Getting the correct data also assumes that the data source contains the 
right level of measurement and a classification system that works for 
your application. Getting a soil map of Kansas only to find that the map 
is based on a Russian soil classification system doesn’t do you much 
good if you are looking for a soil in the US classification system.
 
✓ Are your data on the right scale? If you’re interested in road networks 
for a city but search on a database for an entire country, you face a good 
chance that the smaller roads don’t appear in the database. Usually, this 
situation occurs when you don’t have access to the level of detail you 
want. Be prepared to throw stuff out if your results are inaccurate.
 
✓ Are the data timely? If your data source has information from different 
time periods, double check that you’re asking for results from the right 
one. Looking at the population of African countries by using the 1998 
data doesn’t return results from the census conducted in 2000.
 
✓ Are the data complete? Having complete data means that nothing is 
missing (duh), but it also means that your data offer more than just the 
database objects. You need to know exactly what the categories mean, 
where the data came from, and where you can go to get updated data. 
This data-about-data is called metadata, and it functions to provide addi-
tional information about a database component’s origin, format, synop-
sis, and so on. Most GIS include a way to add metadata (as I describe in 
Chapter 8), but sometimes GIS databases don’t include the metadata. 
This omission limits the utility of the data.

Searching for Geographic Objects, 
Distributions, and Groups
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing why you search for polygons
▶ Searching the right polygons for your needs
▶ Understanding the six methods for locating polygons
▶ Turning found objects into groups
A
fter you put geographic data into the computer, you use GIS frequently 
to get information derived from the data back out. To retrieve data that 
best suits your needs, you must know why, where, and how you search for 
geographic objects (such as roads, rivers, lakes, power plants, and thousands 
of others) and distributions represented by polygons (such as the range of an 
animal species or ethnic groups within a nation).
The vast majority of geographic objects that you encounter every day occur 
in groups. Some of these groups even have specific names. Birds occur in 
flocks, cattle in herds, trees in forests or orchards, quail in coveys, geese in 
gaggles, and the list goes on. Beyond the biological groups, glacial features 
(called drumlins) form in swarms, streets form networks, streams form water-
sheds, homes form neighborhoods, and many more. People assign special 
names to groups to provide a handy way to refer to features that look alike, 
act alike, occur in similar places, are near certain features, or occur in similar 
patterns or densities.
In this chapter, I show you how to specify search criteria that can yield the 
results you’re looking for. And after a brief look at common GIS interfaces, I 
explain the six methods for searching for polygons and why you might need 
to use each one. You can search for groups of objects by using the same GIS 
functions that you use to search for individual objects. Then, you can classify 
the whole group to suit your needs. This chapter shows you how to conduct 
a search for groups of objects, too.

166
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Searching Polygons in a GIS
When GIS first came on the scene, resource specialists mainly used it to 
examine large portions of natural resources that were distributed over large 
areas of land. Similar data that spreads over large areas, represented by poly-
gons (in vector GIS), are called a distribution. Distributions are still among the 
most important features in GIS. GIS can represent distributions of people, ani-
mals, disease, crime, land use, pollution, and more. To get the most from GIS, 
get familiar with distributions and use that information to make decisions. 
(See Chapter 3 for more about distributions.)
Whether polygons represent distributions of individual objects (such as 
people or animals) or area features (such as land parcels or forests), you can 
use many of their properties for later analysis. The data inside polygons can 
exist at any of the measurement scales, including nominal, ordinal, interval, 
ratio, or scalar. (I talk about measurement in Chapters 1 and 3.) You can look 
for objects based on thematic content, such as types of animals, houses, or 
trees. You can describe distributions based on size, orientation, perimeter, 
area, change over time, and many other factors.
 
Polygons are connected to each other, surround other things, and are sur-
rounded by other things. They have a long list of spatial relationships that 
other objects don’t have. To get the most from GIS, you use those properties 
and relationships to make decisions regarding the data you retrieve when you 
search your GIS.
Searching for the Right Objects
When you search for an object, you must know what you need to accomplish 
with it before you can determine which object can do the trick. You look for 
your car keys because you want to drive your car, you look for your receipts 
because you need to do your taxes, and you look up a telephone number 
because you need to make a phone call. You have the same basic reasons for 
searching for two-dimensional objects (such as land parcels, landforms, or 
soil polygons and their distributions) in GIS.
You can decide to conduct a search for a bunch of reasons. You may want to 
search for objects within a polygon out of simple curiosity. You may want to 
open a map just to see the map itself and identify any patterns that appear. 
Even a quick perusal of map content shows you
 
✓ What categories are available: For example, what land-use categories 
are present in a land-use map.

167
 Chapter 11: Searching for Geographic Objects, Distributions, and Groups
 
✓ The general size and shape of the polygons: For example, where pine 
bark beetle infestation is occurring in a forest stand.
 
✓ The general configuration and locations of polygons: For example, 
where populations at risk from potential hazardous materials spills are 
distributed.
Think of searching a polygon as taking a journey through its data to discover 
what’s where. Think of yourself as a world explorer and think about your 
maps as questions, rather than answers. When you get in this mindset, such 
questions (or hypotheses) lead to additional exploration: searches, measure-
ments, and subsequent analyses.
Extracting specific information
Simple curiosity is fine, but a more common reason you conduct a search of 
polygonal objects and distributions is to extract specific information from 
the maps. You may conduct a search to simply explore the data, but most 
often, you use more complex analysis after data exploration or as a result of 
previous knowledge of the map content.
You gain knowledge about map content by viewing similar maps or by draw-
ing on your familiarity with the real world represented by the map. For exam-
ple, you might examine the locations of different land-use types relative to 
different elevation zones. You can examine the relationship of your maps’ fea-
tures by looking at the maps, their legends, and any associated tabular data 
(for example, a road map might have a table showing the mileage between 
major cities).
Searching for objects in modern GIS requires a logic-based search strategy, 
which a graphical user interface (GUI) provides (as shown in Figure 11-1). 
The GUI uses Structured Query Language (SQL), which includes basic AND, 
OR, and NOT operators, as well as mathematical comparative operators such 
as =, >=, <, and many others.
 
Misplaced parentheses or other punctuation marks can wreak havoc with 
searches that use SQL search methods such as the one shown in Figure 11-1. 
Until you get really comfortable with the syntax, do searches in small bites, 
creating interim maps that you analyze, combine, modify, and otherwise work 
with later. This approach forces you to think clearly about what data you’re 
looking for and formulate your queries succinctly.

Knowing the size of each polygon
When you enter polygon information in a GIS, the software often calculates 
each polygon’s area and perimeter, and then stores the calculations in asso-
ciated database tables. Beyond those simple measures, you can find infor-
mation about distances between polygons, orientation, roundness or other 
shape values, major and minor axis lengths, and so on.
Working with concentrations 
of point objects
With today’s GIS software, you can create polygons based on the concen-
trations of point objects. For example, suppose you map individual crime 
occurrences and notice concentrations in particular neighborhoods. You can 
group these concentrations into separate polygons (by neighborhood) and 
use those polygons to compare crime data to neighborhood economic condi-
tions. Some GIS analysts call this hot spot analysis.
Maps can contain many related polygons. Think about these related 
distributions:
 
✓ Zoning polygons coinciding with land values
 
✓ Vegetation patterns coinciding with animal ranges

169
 Chapter 11: Searching for Geographic Objects, Distributions, and Groups
 
✓ Average income by census district compared to education level
 
✓ Land-use patterns in 1997 compared to land-use patterns in 2007
 
✓ High cancer areas compared to hazardous waste sites
Reorganizing data
You can modify polygonal categories, values, or boundaries so that you can 
control the content of the maps you use for analysis. When you do so, you 
don’t change the data; you just organize it differently. And you have various 
ways to reorganize map content, including
 
✓ Clumping, or aggregating, categories: For example, you might change 
categories such as Pine, Oak, Birch, and other tree types into a single 
category called Forest (see Figure 11-2). You might want to use this 
larger category to compare the position of the resulting polygon to areas 
of land owned by the federal government.

✓ Changing data measurement scales: Suppose you have maps of land 
cover (a fancy name for what’s on the land), and you want to change 
these nominal data (farmland, bare soil, grassland, forest, abandoned, 
and so on) to ranked data based on the degree to which the land cover 
types allow soil erosion. To make this change, you assign each category 
a number. In this case, you want the numbers to show the susceptibility 
to erosion. Because bare soil is probably the most susceptible, you give 
it a value of 1. Abandoned land gets a value of 2; farmland gets a 3; forest 
gets a 4; and grassland gets a 5.

Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
Locating 2-D Map Objects
You can search for polygons in six ways: by (1) category, (2) data level, (3) 
size, (4) arrangement, (5) orientation, or (6) position. Each method accom-
plishes a specific goal. For example, you might want to search for a certain 
type of forest (category), or for forests that are grouped together (arrange-
ments), or forests that occur in linear strips oriented north and south (orienta-
tion). The following sections offer examples that use each of the six methods.
Searching based on category
Most objects, whether stored at ordinal, scalar, interval, or ratio scales, typi-
cally have names associated with them. If you aren’t interested in how much 
or how many, then you want to search by category name. A common type 
of nominal map is the land-cover or land-use map. Such maps depict many 
types of land cover or land use and show these features as categories in the 
legend (see Figure 11-3).
 
Figure 11-3:

the catego-
ries of land

display.
 
Legend
Some systems enable you to access nominal categories directly from the map 
legend, and others give you a GUI based on SQL. (I talk a bit about search 
strategies in the section “Extracting specific information,” earlier in this chap-
ter.) The results of searching from the legend or with a GUI differ:
 
✓ When you search from a legend, you usually double-click the legend 
itself and pull up a list of options that you can pick from. Essentially, 
though, you’re simply reclassifying or hiding categories (to remove 
them from view, see Figure 11-4), not really creating a new map. 

171
 Chapter 11: Searching for Geographic Objects, Distributions, and Groups
 
✓ The GUI approach usually asks you to search categories by using a 
series of logical or mathematical operators. You use the GUI to find the 
categories you’re interested in, and the search creates a whole new map 
for you.

Get to know your GUI search tool as soon as possible — you’ll use it often in 
your GIS work. Start with simple searches, and when you get comfortable with 
it, move to more complex searches. Have fun with it!
Finding polygons based on level
Many polygons come in ordinal (ranked) categories. The user might have cre-
ated those categories for a particular use in which the scale is context-depen-
dent (scalar), or another user might use more universally understood categories, 
such as predefined values for high, medium, and low housing densities.
In a land-use map like the one shown in Figure 11-3, you can select 
Residential as a single category based on nominal data. But suppose that you 
want to be more specific. The map data might offer the residential land uses 
not just as a single category, but also at different levels based on the number 
or type of housing units. Figure 11-5 shows the map legend with a breakdown 
of residential land use in levels of multi-family units.
You might want to buy a home in a low-density residential neighborhood 
(one that doesn’t have many multi-family units). By selecting a polygon that 
represents low density levels from among all the other housing polygons, you 
can determine which parts of town would suit your living needs. Figure 11-6

172
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
shows how you can use a built-in GUI search function to select the levels of 
housing density from within the GIS database and create a new map from 
these more specific categories.
 
Searching for different attributes within a map legend doesn’t create a new 
layer. Most often, searching for attributes allows you to quickly change the 
display, but that’s about it. If you want to save and use the resulting map, you 
must use the GUI.

 Chapter 11: Searching for Geographic Objects, Distributions, and Groups
Looking for polygons based on value
Suppose that, looking at a land-use map, you have a layer that shows the 
value of the land in dollars per acre. Such ratio-scale data are easy to sepa-
rate from one another because they are numeric values. If you want to buy 
land that’s priced at $100,000 or less per acre, for example, you need only 
select all land parcels whose attributes match the value less than or equal to 
$100,000 (see Figure 11-7).
 
Figure 11-7: 
Selecting 
polygons 
based on 
value.
 
 
Maps can trick you. Before you search for polygons based on value, be sure 
that you’re searching for the correct unit value. If you’re looking for land 
based on price, for example, you’re probably looking for price per unit area, 
not total price. If your map shows total price, you need to do some math to 
figure out the price per unit area.
Locating polygons based on 
size, shape, and orientation
Polygons come in different sizes and shapes. Asymmetrical polygons are 
aligned in a particular direction (north, south, east, west, northeast, south-
west, or some other combination). You can find polygonal features based on 
their size, shape, and alignment, but some preparation must take place first. 
Don’t worry — the GIS software does the prep work. You just have to find 
and use its tools to do your search.
If you’re buying land, you need to know more than just how much it costs. 
You also need to know how big it is. After all, if you can get land for less than 

174
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
$100,000 per acre but you need 5 acres, you must specify the amount of land 
(the size of the parcel) in your search. The good news is that both raster and 
vector GIS calculate the size of the polygons when you input those polygons 
into the database. 
So, the software does the first part you need — determining the polygons’ 
sizes — for you. You can go into the software and find the polygons based on 
some set criteria that you define, such as >5 Acre. In fact, you can combine 
the >5 Acre search with the <=$100,000 per Acre search to find just the set of 
lots that you might want to buy. The results of a combined search look some-
thing like the map in Figure 11-8.
 
Figure 11-8: 
Locating 
polygons 
based on 
size and 
price per 
acre.
 
 
With GIS, you can use the many maps that you create to create even more 
maps, narrowing your search while you go. These steps show an example of 
how this narrowing-down process works:
 
1. Use your GIS interface to apply a SQL query that selects properties 
within a particular price range.
 
 The resulting display highlights the properties that match your search.
 
2. In that same map (with the properties already highlighted), apply 
another query to select properties of a particular acreage.
 
 When you get the results, you probably have more than one possible 
parcel to choose from. Some parcels might be much bigger than the 5 
acres you need. You can modify your search to find only those parcels 
that are between 5 and 7 acres. (In fact, you could have done that in 
your first search.)

175
 Chapter 11: Searching for Geographic Objects, Distributions, and Groups
 
3. Save the map you made (in this example, all the land parcels between 
5 and 7 acres in size and priced at less than or equal to $100,000) to a 
new map.
 
 But even then, you might have too many choices. Luckily, you can 
narrow your search even more. You notice that not all the parcels are 
the same shape: Some are long and skinny, and others are square and 
blocky. And you decide to select parcels on the basis of shape.
 
4. Visually inspect the polygon shapes that represent your selections up 
to this point and choose from what you see.
 
 Perhaps you decide that you like the blocky parcels, as opposed to the 
ones that are long and skinny, and you want to narrow the selected 
properties accordingly. The good news is that you can spot (within your 
ever-narrowing set of properties) what you need right away.
 
 You can calculate shape in GIS, but you don’t really need that level of 
technical detail right now. In fact, most GIS software is only beginning to 
deal with shape analysis. Such power will no doubt be increasingly avail-
able as GIS software developers create new programs for shape analysis.
 
 Most GIS software allows you to draw boxes that touch the map features 
you want (which you can read about in Chapter 10), so you don’t have 
to do any fancy calculations. Just point and click.
 
5. Draw boxes that intersect the polygons you see that match your criteria.
 
 Besides not wanting long, skinny parcels, you might want parcels 
that are oriented north and south, rather than east and west. Choose 
selected polygons that are the right shape and oriented just the way you 
want them.
When you’re done, you can save this multi-step search as a map, as well. So, 
take the lead with your search criteria! Instead of relying solely on the GUI 
and SQL, you get to use your own powers of observation and select items 
based on what you see.
Finding polygons based on 
location and position
While you search for polygons, you may want to consider where they’re 
located and how they’re positioned. You may, for example, want your parcels 
within a certain distance of town so that you don’t have to travel too far every 
day. And maybe you want to find land near a lake so that you can go fishing 
without having to drive for hours. You might also want your land to be on a hill 
rather than in a valley, or in the foothills rather than in the mountains.

176
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
You can perform searches based on location and position by using the GUI 
query tool. In Chapter 12, I show you how to measure distance. Most GIS 
software even has a tool you can use to select objects that are touching 
(adjacent), so you know exactly what parcels of land are next to each other.
 
Like you do when locating parcels with particular sizes, shapes, and orienta-
tions, you can easily estimate distances from one polygon to another and use 
the graphical query tool — the little box that you drag over the polygons — to 
select the ones you want.
Defining the Groups You Want to Find
Your project goals almost entirely control how you choose the groups of 
features you want to find. No formula exists for choosing groups, but you can 
ask yourself some basic questions. These questions are based on the types 
of data you have, the theme or themes you’re interested in, and what feature 
properties and underlying geography you need to know about.
Looking for common properties
To find groups of geographic features — whether they’re points, lines, poly-
gons, or even surfaces — you first need to know what properties they share. 
You already do this type of grouping naturally when you decide on the types 
of movies you like to watch (categories); whether to order a small, medium, 
or large pizza (rankings); or how much money to spend for various types 
of entertainment (ranges). You can use the same thought process to select 
polygons by
 
✓ Category: The same type of object. You can select all oak trees in a map 
of trees, single-family dwellings in a map of housing, highways in a map 
of transportation, agricultural lands in a land-use map, or alluvial fans in 
a landform map.
 
✓ Rank: You can search for groups of features based on differences in 
rank. For example, separating cities by population ranges or selecting 
land units by high, medium, and low risk for earthquake or avalanche.
 
✓ Scale: If you have point, line, area, and surface data measured at inter-
val or ratio scales, you can group those features pretty simply. You can 
select all stores (points) that have a particular dollar value of sales, 
roads (lines) that have selected specific traffic volumes, land parcels 
(polygons) that fall within a range of value per acre, or topographic sur-
faces that have slopes at a given range of elevation that change over a 
certain distance.

177
 Chapter 11: Searching for Geographic Objects, Distributions, and Groups
 
✓ Spacing: You might want to select objects based on what they’re near, 
how far apart they are, their average spacing, or whether they’re evenly 
spaced, dispersed, or clustered.
You can apply all these methods to properties of the intervening space (the 
space between features), to the features themselves, and to those features’ 
shapes.
Looking for common positioning
Sometimes, you may find that geographic features seem to occur in some 
places and are totally absent or very poorly represented in other places. 
Such differences in density are not necessarily just statistical anomalies. 
Instead, the features tend to occur in certain places because of some underly-
ing process or control that causes them to occur in those places and not in 
other places (that is, the distributions are determined by another distribu-
tion or process). In other cases, the relative density of the features changes 
in an observable, statistically predictable fashion.
GIS
 
Here’s a quick list of some features that might exhibit patterns related to some 
form of controls or outside forces:
 
✓ Earthquakes and volcanoes (related to the locations of continental plates)
 
✓ Vegetation types (related to soil types, slope and aspect, or herbicides)
 
✓ Mobile homes (related to zoning)
 
✓ Vandalism (related to neighborhood type and/or gang activity)
 
✓ Winter tourists (related to winter temperatures)
Because these features occur in one area versus another area, you have to deal 
with a new problem — that of determining why such differences exist. To a 
geographer, such patterns form questions. These questions might include:
 
✓ Is the pattern real or a product of sampling (or lack of sampling)? 
Some striking distribution changes aren’t necessarily accurate: They 
may be a result of lack of sampling. First, check whether your distribu-
tion reflects sampling methods, mistakes, omissions, or even oversam-
pling in one area versus another. You need to know your data (a good 
reason to produce your own database when you can) or establish a way 
to spot-check your data for accuracy. Check out Chapter 8 for more on 
sampling.
 
 Don’t just assume the patterns that occur on maps are accurate. Check the 
metadata for information on methods and sampling procedures, as well as 
any other information that allows you to verify the data’s reliability.

✓ Is there a distinct difference between places where features occur? 
Sudden changes most often indicate an equally abrupt change in some 
other factor that either controls or contributes to the existence of the 
features. And if your distribution changes gradually, a process is prob-
ably controlling that change. The process may occur naturally. Suppose 
you notice that the cotton plants that have grown in a certain place for 
a long time are starting to die off. The growing process takes nutrients 
from the soil, and the cotton plants — growing in one location year after 
year — have depleted the nutrients in that area.
 
 If the distribution changes gradually and in a particular direction, this 
change may reflect the direction of change in an underlying process. For 
example, density may seem to change from the middle outward or from 
one direction to another. A change from the middle outward can indi-
cate dispersion from high concentrations to low concentrations, while 
a directional movement can indicate movement toward more favorable 
environments, sources of nutrition, and so on. For example, a herd of 
bison may migrate toward new sources of plants for grazing.
 
 Abrupt changes in distribution usually indicate the presence or absence 
of a controlling factor.
 
✓ What area of the map does a set of points or lines occupy? When 
distributions are spottier and change from dense to sparse in a more 
variable way, you may find it difficult to figure out whether the patchy 
distributions (each of which might be either clearly defined or gradually 
changing) are related to one another functionally. But you absolutely 
must make this determination because your conclusion based on a dis-
tribution often assumes that the distribution maps are correct. When 
you create a grouping, having experience observing how distributions 
naturally cluster helps you determine where to draw the lines around 
groups of features. Some specialized software packages use sophisti-
cated statistical techniques to make these grouping decisions, but most 
general GIS software is only just catching up.
 
 One basic method of enclosing distributions into a single polygon is 
almost like using shrink-wrap. You decide which points you want to 
include, and the software draws a polygon by connecting the outside 
points, creating the least convex polygon (like the one shown in Figure 
11-9). This simple and easy method groups features rather nicely for 
most distributions. If you need more accurate methods, you can search 
the spatial statistics packages included in modern GIS software.
 
✓ Does the area of distribution correspond to any other feature or dis-
tribution? When you begin to look at distributions and see patterns in 
those distributions, you naturally start asking whether one pattern is 
related to another, whether one causes the other to exist, and to what 
degree these patterns correspond. Chapter 15 addresses this question 
in detail.

Grouping by what you already know
Even the seemingly mundane task of finding the location of geographic fea-
tures lets you create new maps that answer questions and allow you to make 
powerful decisions. When you engage your GIS to find and group objects, you 
base your search strategy on your project goals (what you need to know), 
but also rely on what you already know to help direct your search.
GIS
 
Suppose that you’re an epidemiologist (a scientist who studies infections). You 
need to understand the distribution and spread of West Nile virus. West Nile 
virus is spread by mosquitoes, which need standing water to breed. You must 
therefore identify places where outbreaks of the disease occur most fre-
quently so that you can identify places where you can hopefully eliminate the 
cause (the infected mosquitoes).
This basic scenario gives you all the building blocks you need to formulate 
your questions and decide what types of data groups you’re looking for. Just 
follow these steps:
 
1. Identify your target objects and a search strategy to find them.
 
 To satisfy the goal in this example (eliminating infected mosquitoes), I 
want to locate and group two things: patients with West Nile virus and 
mosquito breeding grounds. You select, qualify, and group your data 
basing your strategy on what you know:
 
• To find patients: Look for point data in the form of the locations of 
patients. You need to group these patients into two classes: those 
who have contracted West Nile and those who haven’t.
 
 Further qualify your patient data by selecting out the class data 
that occur in high density — for example, more than two cases 
of the disease per square mile. Now, you have a set of points that 
illustrates high versus low density of West Nile virus throughout 

180
Part III: Retrieving, Counting, and Characterizing Geography 
your study areas. By narrowing down the patient data groups, you 
may begin to see patterns emerging that suggest selected areas 
that might have high numbers of mosquitoes.
 
• To find mosquito breeding grounds: It’s really hard to map mos-
quitoes as point objects (they’re pretty little, and those GPS units 
make flying awfully difficult). But you do know that mosquitoes 
require standing water to breed. Standing water can be anything 
from ponds to puddles, pools to tires with water in them, and you 
just happen to have data on all these features. You need to group 
the polygons that are likely to have standing water and those that 
aren’t because you assume that areas with lots of standing water 
(a higher density of standing-water polygons) are much more likely 
to be mosquito breeding grounds.
 
 So, you regroup your polygons based on how clustered they are, in 
relation to one another, using the feature’s geography — defined 
here as the distribution of the polygons — to give you a ranking of 
high, medium, and low potential for breeding mosquitoes.
 
2. Create maps showing your newly grouped target objects.
 
 In this example, you have one map that shows concentrations of West 
Nile virus cases and another map that shows different levels of mosquito 
breeding potential.
 
3. Overlay and compare the maps showing the grouped objects.
 
 If your assumptions are correct, you see higher concentrations of West 
Nile virus near the locations having a higher potential for mosquito 
breeding grounds. This correlation suggests exactly where you can 
begin a mosquito abatement program to reduce the risk of infection.
 
 But you might also see situations in which higher outbreaks seem to 
occur where mosquito-breeding potential is medium or even low, sug-
gesting that you need to do a further examination of geographic features 
that might account for these inconsistencies.
This example shows you how to perform a simple analysis of the types of 
objects (in this case, points and polygons), the measurement levels (nomi-
nal), and their geographic distributional attributes (concentrations of infec-
tions and of standing water sources).
 
You can use the same approach, basing your grouping strategy on what you 
need to know plus what you already know, to satisfy many other kinds of GIS 
projects. In any case, many features you want to group share both functional 
and spatial relationships. The functional relationships (such as cause and 
effect) help you decide which features you want to search, and the spatial 
relationships allow you to identify the degree of spatial co-occurrence (where 
different geographic features seem to occur in the same locations). Chapter 16 
talks about how you can use GIS software to make these comparisons without 
guesswork.

Analyzing 
Geographic 
Patterns

In this part . . .
T
he most advanced functions of GIS lie in the systems’ 
capacity to measure geographic features, including 
distances, areas, networks, surfaces, and all their related 
characteristics. In this part, you find out how GIS per-
forms individual tasks, such as finding shortest or fastest 
routes, analyzing visibility, assessing fluid accumulation 
and flood zones, and many others. Also, you discover how 
to combine these individual operations to create complex, 
real-world models, which are (in my opinion) the most 
rewarding pinnacle of the GIS analyst’s art and science.

Measuring Distance
In This Chapter

▶ Figuring out distance based on function
Y
ou can measure anything you put on a map. You use map measurements 
to figure out how far you are from one place or another, how much land 
you own, how much ore you might expect to get from a new mine, and many 
other measurements. You can measure heights, widths, depths, lengths, 
areas, and volumes. You can also compare measurements as ratios — for 
example, ratios of length to width, perimeter to area, or height to distance.
Measuring geographic features is one of a GIS’s strengths, and it does the 
measuring very quickly! Because you can measure many features quickly, 
you can use those measurements to help you make decisions about what 
route to take (by comparing distances between features), whether one place 
is better than another for mining (by calculating the volume of a specific 
feature), or where you’re likely to find the best ski slopes (by evaluating a 
feature’s height against its length).
In this chapter, I show how GIS gives you the power to measure all sorts of fea-
tures. First, I explain the measurements that GIS software generates by default 
(such as grid cell size), and then I describe how the GIS uses these numbers to 
calculate other measurements (such as distance between objects). I also tell 
you about the difference between relative and absolute measurements, and 
when you might want to use each. I explain how you can use measurement 
tools to describe how features are distributed relative to each other and to 
other surrounding features. And finally, I describe how to apply distance to 
make entirely new polygons based on the distances you measure.
Taking Absolute Measurement
When you enter data into a GIS, the software keeps records of those points, 
lines, and polygons. More important, it keeps a record of the X and Y locations 

184
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
of your vector or raster objects. It stores the size of the grid cells and the 
lengths of the lines. Having these records saves a lot of time when you calcu-
late distances.
The measurement of absolute distances, whether between objects or along 
lines, is computed differently for raster and vector data structures. The fol-
lowing sections describe these measurement methods and how the computer 
implements them for both data types.
Finding the shortest straight-line path
Finding the shortest straight-line path between any two points is the simplest 
method to measure distance. Often called “as the crow flies” distance, this 
Euclidean method makes two assumptions:
1. No obstructions block the path between the two points.
2. You don’t need to travel along established paths and roads.
The following sections describe how the GIS software enables you to find the 
shortest straight-line path between two points that exist under a variety of 
circumstances.
Finding the shortest distance on a flat surface
If you’re working on a flat surface, the shortest distance between any two 
points (a straight line) is based on a well-known mathematical equation 
(c2 = a2 + b2), the Pythagorean Theorem (named after the ancient Greek math-
ematician Pythagoras). The Pythagorean Theorem is based on the use of a 
geometric form called a right triangle — any triangle that has one corner that 
makes a right-angle turn (90 degrees). The longest side of this triangle, the 
one opposite the right-angle bend, is called the hypotenuse. Figure 12-1 shows 
an example of a right triangle.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
Each of the two points (that you want to measure the distance between) is 
defined by an X coordinate and a Y coordinate along number lines. To locate 
each point, you have to move horizontally and vertically along the number 
lines from the origin point (where the right angle forms) to the values that 
define your points. These movements along the number lines define the 
straight legs of your right triangle. You can think of the distance between 
those two points as the hypotenuse of your right triangle.
When measuring real Earth distances in a GIS, the software calculates the 
hypotenuse distance using the X and Y values of two points in a modification 
of the Pythagorean Theorem called the distance formula. You’ll encounter this 
distance formula many times in your GIS work.
 
When you need a quick online refresher on the distance formula, visit www.
purplemath.com/modules/distform.htm.
Finding the shortest distance on the spherical Earth
The GIS can also calculate distance between a set of latitude and longitude 
coordinates on a spherical Earth. You may need to find the shortest distance 
between two points on the globe. This calculation is called a great circle dis-
tance and uses a geographic grid. The calculation of latitude and longitude 
distances has some very strong similarities to calculating distance by using 
Remembering sines and cosines
When you work with planar coordinates for 
measuring distance, you need to know the X 
and Y values for each point. So, you can convert 
spherical coordinates to planar coordinates as 
follows:
 ✓ The X location: X = r × cos(a) × cos(b)
 ✓ The Y location: Y = r × cos(a) × sin(b)
Here are what the letters stand for in the 
preceding transformations:
 ✓ r: The radius of the Earth
 ✓ a: The latitude
 ✓ b: The longitude
Seeing sines (abbreviated sin) and cosines 
(abbreviated cos) may make your eyes water, 
but you can remember what these terms mean 
by taking the pneumonic device SOHCAHTOA 
and breaking it into three parts — SOH, CAH, 
and TOA:
 ✓ SOH: Sine equals Opposite over 
Hypotenuse
 ✓ CAH: Cosine equals Adjacent over 
Hypotenuse
 ✓ TOA: Tangent equals Opposite over 
Adjacent
So, to calculate sines and cosines, you really 
just have to divide. After you transform all your 
spherical coordinates to planar coordinates, 
you can apply the formulas that you use to cal-
culate straight-line distance to your new X and 
Y coordinates. But I have even better news — 
the GIS does all this for you!

186
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
flat (planar) coordinates and the distance equation. (In Chapter 2, I describe 
a bit about converting a spherical Earth to its representation on a flat piece 
of paper.) This process, called map projection, involves mathematics because 
it converts spherical coordinates to planar coordinates.
Conversely, no space on the Earth is totally flat, so calculating the distance 
between any two points requires some determination of the spherical coordi-
nates. Your GIS is already set up to perform these calculations for you. Using 
trigonometric formulas and the X and Y (planar) coordinates of geographic 
features, your software can easily change back and forth from spherical 
geometry to planar geometry. If you really want a peek at the math behind 
this conversion, check out the sidebar “Remembering sines and cosines.”
Measuring distances in grid cells
Measuring distances in raster systems (using grid cells) is a bit different than 
measuring distance in vector systems, both conceptually and computationally. 
Many raster GIS packages allow you to calculate measurements in both flat 
coordinate systems and the geographic grid (latitude and longitude coordi-
nates). The alternative to measuring by coordinates is counting up grid cells.
If all the grid cells in the path you’re measuring are edge-to-edge (orthogo-
nal), you can easily figure the distance the path covers. Just count up the 
grid cells and multiply that number by the width of the grid cell. For example, 
if you count 150 grid cells from one point to another and each grid cell is 20 
meters across, the total distance is 20 × 150, or 300 meters.
This very simple approach gives you pretty accurate results, but only if all the 
grid cells are orthogonal or all distances are exactly lined up by the cardinal 
directions. In real distances, you seldom get such an exact configuration. If 
you’re working with a raster system in which you want to measure distances 
that are diagonal, you need to measure grid cells that are diagonal to one 
another, at least for some portion of the distance (as shown in Figure 12-2).

 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
Measuring Manhattan distance
When I was a young lad in Minnesota, I used to like to go through large 
department stores on my way home to get out of the stinging cold and, ide-
ally, shorten my path. But actually, the path I took was just as jagged as if I’d 
stayed outside. Although I did manage to warm up for a few minutes, I prob-
ably didn’t make my trip any shorter.
Imagine you’re in the downtown business portion of any large city, such as 
New York City’s Manhattan, where the streets are laid out like a grid. Each 
block is the same size, and tall buildings prevent you from moving anywhere 
but along these blocks — unless you can leap tall buildings in a single bound, 
of course. Likewise, cars must follow the streets that separate these blocks. 
The distance from point A to point B, unless both points are on the same 
block, is going to be longer than if you could travel “as the crow flies,” as I 
discuss in the section “Finding the shortest straight-line path,” earlier in this 
chapter. Because Manhattan is an excellent example of this restricted move-
ment, geographers refer to distance measurements in this environment as 
Manhattan distance.
Figure 12-3 shows a hypothetical city with the same type of structure as 
downtown Manhattan. To travel from point A to point B, you need to follow 
the edges of the blocks. By moving along the blocks, you have to travel a 
much larger distance than if you could travel the straight-line distance. This 
grid structure allows many possible paths from one point to another, but 
each path covers essentially the same distance.

188
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
To calculate Manhattan distance, you use a modification of the distance 
equation, but conceptually, the calculation is really much simpler than that. 
Because each of the edges for each block is a straight line segment, you need 
to know only where the X and Y coordinates are for the ends of each line 
segment. Most GIS software automatically stores that information when you 
first input the data. You can easily calculate each line segment’s length using 
the distance equation included in the GIS software. To determine the total 
Manhattan distance, you simply let the software add together each individual 
line segment’s length.
Calculating distance along networks
You encounter many types of routes in GIS work — including footpaths, 
animal tracks, rail lines, intercity roads, and street patterns — that look noth-
ing like Manhattan. Each of these networks typically indicates an imposed 
structure on distance traveled. To calculate distance along these networks, 
the GIS measures vector segment lengths or grid-cell lengths for vector and 
raster, respectively.
 
✓ Vector: The GIS first retrieves the X and Y coordinates of each line seg-
ment’s endpoints (stored at input) and then uses the distance equation 
to determine each line segment’s length. Finally, the GIS adds together 
all the individual line segment lengths.
 
✓ Raster: The GIS finds each orthogonal grid cell’s width and then adds 
those to get the total length. When grid cells are diagonal to each other, 
the lengths are measured as the width multiplied by 1.414 (the diagonal 
distance of a grid cell), as illustrated in Figure 12-2.
 
You can measure linear features in raster, but you can both represent and 
measure features more accurately in vector.
In Manhattan distance, you don’t gain anything by choosing a different route. 
With most irregular networks, however, you can choose many routes from 
point A to point B, and these routes often have wildly different distances. 
Your software can measure all these possible routes and find the one that 
has the shortest distance by using the shortest path algorithm (an algorithm 
is like a recipe to solve a problem). Chapter 16 covers the shortest path algo-
rithm in more detail.
Working with buffers
Nearly all GIS software has a set of special distance functions designed to 
selectively calculate distances around existing geographic features. These 
operations are called buffering (no, not like the aspirin), and the result is 

189
 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
called a buffer. The software measures outward a certain distance from a 
point, line, or polygon (even the base of a topographic feature), and it then 
converts that whole area to a polygon.
A lot of real-world features contain buffers — prescribed, natural, or enforced 
distances that surround them:
 
✓ Easements around power lines, railroads, and so on
 
✓ Road frontages and street setbacks
 
✓ River vegetation, beaches, and drainage-way vegetation
 
✓ Police lines, safety zones, and concert barricades
 
✓ Earthquake zones and 100-year flood zones
The user bases each corridor on rules, natural occurrences, safety, utility, 
security, and any number of other factors. The GIS allows you to implement 
these conditions and rules in a number of different ways, as described in the 
following sections.
Placing buffers around points
You can place buffers around point objects, such as wellheads. You can 
decide to make this type of buffer either a single distance measure or in mul-
tiples (as shown in Figure 12-4). So, if you put a buffer around a wellhead as 
a safety corridor, you can actually create several levels of safety corridor — 
100, 200, and 300 meters, for example. These might be classified as modest, 
medium, and high risk based on a safety officer’s experience.
Placing buffers around lines and polygons
Buffers around lines and polygons give you three options that point buffers 
don’t:
 
✓ Variable buffer: By using the GIS variable buffer function, you can select 
the size of the barrier for each portion of a line or polygon feature, 
instead of being forced to use the same-sized buffer for the entire fea-
ture. For example, in a river network, the trunk stream probably has 
more vegetation on it than its tributaries do, so it has a larger corridor 
than its tributaries’ corridors (see Figure 12-5).
 
✓ Setback buffer: You can determine whether a buffer will be the same size 
on either side of a feature. In some cases, this difference is extreme — 
the buffer exists on only one side of a feature. This type of buffer is called 
a setback buffer because it’s “set back” in only one direction. You can 
position a setback in either direction from a line feature (for example, 
the center of a street). For polygon features, the setback buffer is usually 
established (set back) from the perimeter to some distance inside the 
feature.

190
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
 
✓ Bidirectional buffer: Most buffers measure distance outward. Setback 
buffers can measure distance inward. One advantage of doing a buffer 
around an area feature is that you can have a buffer going both direc-
tions at once. Most GIS software allows you to select this option so if 
you want to measure a buffer distance both inward and outward from 
the outside perimeter of an area feature, you can.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
Establishing Relative Measurement
Sometimes, you don’t need to know the exact distance from a reference point 
to a feature; you just need to know whether that feature is close to or far 
from the reference point. In some cases, a feature might actually be touching 
the reference point, a position that’s called adjacency.
Relative measurement is the type of information you need every day. If you 
ask about the distance to something, you don’t always expect, nor even want, 
a precise answer. For example, say you’re in a new town and stop to ask 
directions — “How far am I from the courthouse?” You receive the answer, 
“It’s about 766 meters east south east as the crow flies.” This answer gives 
you an idea of where it is and how far, but you were really looking for some-
thing like, “It’s just a short drive down this street and around the corner.” In 
other words, you just wanted to know whether you were close or whether 
you had to drive for quite some time.
You can use relative measures in many ways:
 
✓ Selecting among different locations
 
✓ Deciding whether you have time to get someplace
 
✓ Knowing whether features such as towns are going to interact with each 
other
 
✓ Determining whether you can find sufficient beachfront property for a 
resort
Adjacency and nearness
When your reference point is so close to a feature that the distance between 
them is essentially zero, you call that distance adjacency. The distance mea-
sure for adjacency involves how many features are at a distance of zero from 
your reference point.
Because relative measurement requires a starting point, you can easily deter-
mine whether something is near or far by creating distance buffers based 
on your definition of near or far. Current GIS technology can easily measure 
distance, but it can’t make decisions about what you consider near or far for 
a given application. Suppose that you want to know which parcels of land 
are near (within a given specified distance of) a lake. You follow these basic 
steps to define near as within a quarter mile of the lake:

192
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
 
1. Create a buffer that’s a quarter of a mile from the polygon you select.
 
 In this example (see Figure 12-6), I select the Lake polygon using the 
Select tool and use the Buffer tool to measure a buffer that’s a quarter of 
a mile from the outside of the polygon.
 
2. Use the Adjacency tool to select polygons that touch the buffer.
 
 The software selects which polygons come in contact with any part of 
the distance buffer polygon you created (see Figure 12-6).
You can use a similar method to determine which polygons are actually 
touching, or adjacent. In this case, the GIS software doesn’t need to create 
buffers to measure anything. Instead, it uses that powerful data structure — 
a topological data model — with the idea that the data inside the computer 
already have the necessary information to decide which polygons are con-
nected to which others. (See Chapter 5 for more about the characteristics of 
topological data models.) You just need to issue a command telling the GIS 
which polygon is your target polygon and then ask it to find all the polygons 
that share lines with that polygon (refer to Figure 12-6).

Separation and isolation
When you measure separation and isolation, you compare the absolute coor-
dinates of one geographic feature to several other features so that you can 
determine the average distance from a feature to other features. This form of 
distance measure is especially useful in fields such as ecology, in which sci-
entists need to determine relationships such as whether certain patches of 
vegetation are close enough for species to interact.
To calculate isolation, the software finds all the coordinates of the target 
polygon (a vegetation patch, for example) and measures the distance to the 
nearest points for all the other polygons in the area. Another common way of 
determining isolation is to calculate the average distance between the target 
polygon’s centroid and the centroids of all other polygons.
No matter which method your software uses, it essentially calculates a mea-
sure of average distance among polygons.

193
 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
Containment and surroundedness
You generally think of measuring distance from one thing to another thing. 
When your reference point is inside a polygon, its distance from the edge of 
that polygon is measured inward toward the reference point rather than out-
ward toward other features. This idea is called containment. Containment can 
help you figure out what features are inside other features.
To measure containment, the GIS essentially measures a distance inward 
from the edge vertices (the corners) of a polygon or area feature, determining 
whether the X and Y coordinates of your object are all contained within 
the limits of the X and Y coordinates of the polygon that you examine (see 
Figure 12-7).
 
Figure 12-7: 
A point 
object con-
tained in a 
polygon.
 
Point Object
Knowing whether an object is contained in a polygon can help you answer 
these kinds of questions:
 
✓ Does the property I’m interested in fall within a certain school district?
 
✓ Does a particular wildlife species live in a certain habitat type?
 
✓ Do I live inside a 100-year flood zone?
 
✓ Which voting district do I live in?
To answer questions like these (for example, about voting district), you 
usually let the program compare the data from two different maps (for 
example, a street map and a precinct map) because both kinds of data (street 
addresses and precinct boundaries) don’t appear on the same map. Still, to 

194
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
determine whether the distance would be inward (contained) or outward 
(not contained), you use the same calculations that you do for a single map 
analysis because the software essentially compares the X and Y coordinates 
of the points on one map (the street addresses) to the polygon coordinates 
(the precinct boundaries) on the other map.
You can assume that a point object exists either inside or outside a given 
polygon because it has zero dimensions. If you ask whether a line feature 
(such as a highway) is in a polygon (such as your state) or another polygonal 
feature (such as a park) is in a polygon (such as your city), you add dimen-
sionality that complicates the answer. You can have a situation in which part 
of a line or polygon is within another polygon. GIS can help you determine 
whether these objects are only partly in a given polygon by simply comparing 
the locations where the two sets of features intersect.
Measuring Functional Distance
Functional distance is a measure of space based on how that space is used, 
rather than its absolute measurement. Functional distance recognizes that 
you don’t always want to know exactly how near or how far, but rather what 
traveling that distance might cost you in time, money, calories, or even just 
emotional distress. Simply put, you use a different measuring device than for 
absolute measurement. Say that you ask the question, “How far is it to the 
interstate highway from here?” You might get a functional-distance answer of, 
“Oh, not far! Maybe a couple of minutes.”
You can base functional distance on these kinds of factors:
 
✓ Expenditure of fuel, based on how long it takes to travel a distance
 
✓ How much a trip costs
 
✓ How much wear and tear you put on your vehicle
 
✓ How much stress the trip puts on the travelers
These factors can influence functional distance measurements:
 
✓ The ruggedness of the terrain
 
✓ Whether the roads are well maintained
 
✓ The amount and direction of wind
You can find as many functions of geographic space as you can find potential 
users. The following sections describe various forms of functional distance.

 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
Anisotropy (whew!) — non-uniformity
GIS sometimes gives you a chance to impress your friends because you know 
all these cool-sounding words that they’ve never heard. One such word is 
anisotropy, which is the opposite of isotropy. Isotropy is the property of a totally 
smooth surface that has no paths, bumps, wrinkles, vegetation, or obstructions 
of any sort. If you find an isotropic surface, let me know because it’s really just 
a theoretical property. Isotropy doesn’t exist in nature, but it does give you a 
standard against which you can compare all your anisotropic surfaces.
A perfectly isotropic surface that has no obstructions and no slopes, and a 
totally smooth surface produces a situation in which you can travel outward 
from its center in any direction and end up at the same distance from the 
center as you would if you’d gone in any other direction. It’s sort of like a 
series of concentric circles in which the circles show distance traveled at 
selected times.
When you want to measure distances from a point or area to all other loca-
tions throughout a surface, knowing that the surface isn’t uniform (meaning 
not isotropic), the idea of anisotropic surfaces comes in. The roughness of 
the surface is a measure of its departure from the perfect isotropic surface. 
The rougher the surface, the more likely it is to produce friction (resistance 
to movement), as shown in Figure 12-8. The steepness, type of surface, or 
stability of the subsurface can cause varying degrees of friction. Factors such 
as the time of day, direction of travel (uphill or downhill), and how long the 
traveler has been traveling also influence non-uniformity.
Accounting for physical parameters
The most common factors associated with impeding travel are physical:
 
✓ Slope: The steeper the uphill slope, the more friction you experience. 
Think about how driving uphill into the mountains both puts a strain on 
your engine and draws heavily on the old gas tank. This same friction 
impedes bicyclists, hikers, and even wildlife.
 
✓ Type of surface: You can much more easily traverse smooth concrete 
than soft sand; you can walk along a well-trodden hard path more easily 
than saturated ground or mud.
 
✓ Surface features: The surface itself has the ability to support features 
that contribute to the impedance or friction value of the surface — such 
as vegetation. Think how much more easily you can travel along a soft 
grassy surface than along one that has thickets or trees.

196
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Based on intangibles
Many intangibles — subtle, non-physical things — can contribute to differ-
ences in travel patterns and preferences. Pleasant scenery can contribute to 
a lower level of anxiety and may be a reason for taking a physically longer 
route than necessary. Many scenic routes slow travel from one place to 
another but add interest to a trip. State of mind can also help define per-
ceived distance.

Creating the functional surface
Whether you’re trying to reproduce measurable physical parameters or the 
intangibles of functional distance (see the preceding sections), you may have 
difficulty assigning friction values — not because GIS is an immature technol-
ogy, but because geographers might not know enough about the geography 
of friction surfaces to meet your needs.

197
 Chapter 12: Measuring Distance
Researchers have established a few measurable friction surfaces as stan-
dards for some physical features under selected situations. One of these, 
the Universal Soil Loss Equation, models the loss of soil during rain events. 
Within that equation, you need to assign a value to a surface type based on 
the average soil erosion factor for each soil. You then plug these generalized 
numbers into the equation and get a calculated estimate of how much soil 
will erode from a surface based on the surface type.
For GIS, the process of modeling friction surfaces is much the same as using 
the Universal Soil Loss Equation. (In fact, soil scientists and soil geographers 
have used the Universal Soil Loss Equation in GIS modeling.) The GIS modeler 
must encode any impedance to movement into a special map layer, often 
called a friction layer. The greater the friction value, whatever it’s based on, 
the higher the value stored in the friction map.
In theory, you can quantify friction easily: big friction = big numbers, 
little friction = little numbers, no friction = zero. But, in 
reality, the process is a bit more complex than that. Ask yourself how you 
might give friction values to some of the following:
 
✓ Difficulty of crossing a stream
 
✓ Resistance of thickets for hiking
 
✓ Resistance of forests to deer movement
 
✓ The impact of fatigue on walking uphill
 
✓ The expenditure in calories of a cougar traversing a rugged mountain
 
✓ The impact of temperature on the movement of disease
And beyond these physical factors, imagine trying to model the impact of 
scenery on the apparent time of travel. How do you put in numbers friction 
values that have no standards and no measurements? You can use a scalar 
level of geographic measurement, in which you establish the scale of mea-
surement. If you use a scale of 0 to 10, you probably know at least two values 
of your scale — 0 and 10. The 0 value indicates a condition that includes no 
resistance to travel at all, and 10 indicates that no movement can take place.
You need to decide where, within that range, other friction values might fall — 
by using experience, expert opinion, some measurements, surveys, or any 
number of different ways to gather some basic information. Unfortunately, 
you’re stuck with a combination of guesses, experience, opinion, and luck. But 
although little may be known about friction surfaces, you can usually figure out 
the maximum (a barrier) and minimum (frictionless) values that allow you to 
place the upper and lower limits on your scale.

198
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Calculating the functional distance
No matter how you define your numbers, your friction map must interact with 
another map layer that you use to find distances to and from places. Raster 
data models always work best for this kind of layer interaction. Figure 12-9 
shows a raster data model. When you move from cell to cell in this data model 
without accounting for friction, you simply add the distance of the grid cells (1 
width for orthogonal and 1.414 for diagonal, see the earlier section “Measuring 
distances in grid cells”).
After you take friction into account, the computer must add not just the dis-
tance, but also the friction value before it can actually continue to calculate 
distance for the next cell. So, the higher the friction number, the more the 
computer has to add to the cumulative distance value before it graphically 
moves to the next grid cell.

W
hen most folks hear the term surface, they think of the physical sur-
face of the ground beneath their feet. Paper maps that show topog-
raphy use elevation lines, and some globes actually have raised surfaces 
to indicate mountain ranges. With GIS, surface means much more than the 
physical topography. You can map and analyze many different statistical 
surfaces, which include features such as population density, crime rates, and 
cost of living. This chapter shows you the ins and outs of statistical surfaces, 
beginning with an overview of just what makes them tick.
Examining the Character 
of Statistical Surfaces
In GIS, the definition of surface is much broader than simply the physical sur-
face of the land, or topographic surface. Surfaces can relate to other factors 
of the physical environment that help to create non-physical, or statistical, 
factors.
Non-topographic statistical surfaces come in two general forms — those 
relating to the physical environment and those relating to the human envi-
ronment. This breakdown doesn’t have any intrinsic value; it just provides a 
simple way to categorize non-topographic statistical surfaces. In the follow-
ing sections, I refer to only those human environmental factors that relate to 
social and economic activities because these factors are easier to understand 
than the less tangible surfaces (such as those related to beliefs or attitudes, 
for example, whether people think economic conditions are improving) that 
occasionally appear in more obscure applications.

200
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Here are examples of the two general forms of statistical surfaces:
 
✓ Physical environment: The most obvious physical statistical surface is 
topography, but many others are nearly as common and quite useful. 
Many physical maps relate to subsurface phenomena such as depth to 
bedrock, depth to groundwater, thickness of rock formations, depth 
to the ocean floor, and many others. Other physical surfaces are more 
closely related to climate and weather phenomena, such as temperature, 
barometric pressure, and precipitation.
 
✓ Human environment: Think about human environment in terms of 
socio-economic data. These data deal with people — their numbers, 
ages, races, education levels, and incomes — and with factors that affect 
people, such as cost, home values, and taxes. Socio-economic data can 
even represent disease, crime, attitudes, and belief systems. Because 
socio-economic data relate to geographic features that don’t normally 
occur everywhere (that aren’t continuous), analyzing such data often 
requires that you suspend disbelief (pretend that what really doesn’t 
occur everywhere actually does) and treat them as proper, formal statis-
tical surfaces.
All these factors and thousands more involve the measurement and map-
ping of values, each of which has a pair of X and Y coordinates (for location) 
and a third value — the Z value — which describes the surface. You can turn 
the values for each physical or human environment factor into a map of the 
surface that shows the highs and lows in Z value in different places (as illus-
trated in Figure 13-1).

 Chapter 13: Working with Statistical Surfaces
Understanding discrete and 
continuous surfaces
Surfaces can be discrete or continuous. A discrete surface results from map-
ping Z values that occur only in certain places in space. They don’t occur at 
every point in the geographic space covered by the map. People, plants, ani-
mals, houses, and parked cars are all examples of features that you can map 
as Z values and that occur in discrete locations. Because discrete surfaces 
occupy separate and distinct places in space, they appear blocky rather than 
smooth, as illustrated in Figure 13-2.
 
Figure 13-2: 
A side 
view of 
continuous 
and discrete 
surfaces.
 
Continuous
Discrete
Continuous surfaces (also depicted in Figure 13-2) include all features that 
occur everywhere — meaning that every part of the surface has a measurable 
value. Temperature, barometric pressure, and elevation all occur everywhere. 
Because they occur everywhere — at all points of the mapped area — an infi-
nite number of them exist.
 
When you work with continuous surfaces, you work with an infinite number of 
data points. If you tried to include all this data in one GIS database, you’d need 
that database to have infinite storage capability — which just isn’t possible. 
So, you sample from the total and hope that the sample represents the total 
population with an acceptable degree of accuracy.
The section “Sampling statistical surfaces,” later in this chapter, covers the 
specifics of sampling procedures.
Exploring rugged and smooth surfaces
Surfaces can change slowly or abruptly, and you can classify these surfaces 
as rugged (as in rugged terrain) or smooth. The ruggedness or smoothness 
of a surface hints at characteristics of that surface. You can travel over 
gradual changes in topography much more easily than you can travel across 
abrupt changes, which signify rugged terrain; gradual changes in barometric 

202
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
pressure produce less variable weather patterns than abrupt changes; and 
gradual changes in soil nutrient levels result in less variable crop yields than 
abrupt shifts in soil nutrients. Figure 13-3 shows an example of rugged versus 
smooth terrain.

(left) versus

Climbing steep surfaces
Like ruggedness, the steepness (change in Z value over distance) of a surface 
has an impact on surface characteristics. Steep slopes require more fuel 
consumption for uphill travel, steep changes in depth of an ore body change 
the amount of surface material that you must remove to access the ore, and 
steep changes in barometric pressure result in high winds. Figure 13-4 shows 
steep versus gentle topographic slopes.

203
 Chapter 13: Working with Statistical Surfaces
Determining slope and orientation
Slope is basically the measure of steepness for any statistical surface. It is 
essentially a comparison of how rapidly the Z values change as you move 
across the X and Y (horizontal) part of the surface. Any slope is positioned 
at a particular angle to the horizontal (the gradient), and you can measure 
that angle, figure out the nature or extent of the forces that formed it, and see 
how it affects other surface factors by its nature.
The concepts of slope and gradient apply most often to topographic surfaces, 
but not exclusively. For example, the slope of a population distribution indi-
cates how quickly population changes from one place to another. Barometric-
pressure slope often determines wind speeds. Rapid changes (slopes) in 
crime values typically mean that a local area has a location that experiences 
high levels of crime (a hot spot). You could come up with a quite large list of 
possible slopes and their explanations and/or consequences.
The math behind slope and orientation
Slope and orientation are complementary func-
tions, and you generally calculate them simul-
taneously. Here’s a brief look at how you do the 
math to determine slope and orientation:
 ✓ Slope: The amount of slope is based on 
the change in Z value over the change in 
horizontal distance. This ratio is sometimes 
called rise over run. In fact, you calculate 
slope by dividing rise by run. If you’re using 
elevation, you might detect that over a dis-
tance of 8 miles, the elevation has increased 
or decreased (depending on your direction) 
by 40 feet. The equation (rise/run) would be 
40 feet divided by 8 miles. If you divide 40 by 
8, you get a slope or gradient of 5 feet per 
mile (5 ft/mi).
 
 You can also calculate slope by percent 
slope. To do this calculation, you need to 
have the numerator and the denominator in 
the same units. So, for example, a change 
in elevation of 200 feet (rise) for every 1,000 
feet of distance (run) gives you 2/10 or 0.2. If 
you multiply 0.2 by 100, you get a 20-percent 
slope. If you want to measure your slope in 
degrees, apply fancy inverse trigonometric 
functions. But most GIS applications usu-
ally rely on the two basic methods I outline. 
If you want to see all three of these meth-
ods side by side, you might visit
http://geology.isu.edu/geostac/
Field_Exercise/topomaps/
slope_calc.htm
 ✓ Orientation: You usually hear orientation 
compared to compass direction. Good 
compasses are normally calibrated to 360 
degrees, where 0 and 360 are the north 
direction. Not all GIS software follows this 
method of determining direction (for exam-
ple, 0 might be east rather than north), nor 
does it all calibrate in 360-degree segments. 
Some GIS start numbering clockwise from 
east (0), and some reduce the number of 
segments from 360 to a smaller set of num-
bers to save computer space and speed up 
calculations.

204
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
The direction in which a surface changes (orientation) is also very telling. 
For population data, it tells you where population is increasing and where 
it’s decreasing. Barometric surface orientation tells you the direction of the 
wind. The orientation of depth to ore body data gives mining engineers an 
idea of where the ore body is large and where it’s small. You can find many 
possible applications of surface-change directions.
Working with Surface Data
The idea of a geographic surface means that categories of geographic fea-
tures have Z values (for a third dimension) that occur in different places. 
Z values are recorded data, called statistics. Statistical surfaces have three 
properties:
 
✓ They contain Z values distributed across geographic space. Because 
you know that your data are distributed throughout the surface, you can 
predict values in places where you don’t have sample data.
 
✓ They’re measured and recorded at interval or ratio scales. Because 
your data are interval or ratio scale numbers, you have really precise 
statistical numbers to analyze, rather than just names or “big, medium, 
and small” ordinal measurements.
 
✓ You can assume that they’re distributed continuously. A continu-
ous surface means that data points exist everywhere and that you can 
predict them. But if you have a discrete dataset, such as population by 
county across the lower 48 states, you can still do some of this.
These three factors give you serious power to manipulate the statistics to 
predict missing values and group data based on your needs. The following 
sections show you how to sample and analyze the statistical surface. And, 
like always, rules are made to be ignored. You get the scoop on which rules 
you can ignore, and when and how to ignore them, in the section “Ignoring 
the rules,” later in this chapter.
Collecting surface data for entire areas
Topographic surface data are usually collected at point locations with 
survey instruments and GPS units. Sometimes, however, data are collected 
for a whole area all at the same time. If you want to show a map of popula-
tion across the lower 48 states of the United States, you can’t possibly know 
where each person is standing at any given time, so you collect data by 
some political subdivisions, such as counties. So, each county gets only one 
number.

205
 Chapter 13: Working with Statistical Surfaces
You can map both of these datasets (topography or population by 
county). You can even make the discrete data collected by county look 
like data collected at point locations. I explain the difference in the section 
“Understanding Discrete and Continuous Surfaces,” earlier in this chapter.
Sampling statistical surfaces
Continuous statistical surfaces require sampling because the data occur 
everywhere. You can sample a surface by following these steps:
 
1. Examine what the surface looks like.
 
 Take a look at the highs and lows of your surface, and get a feel for its 
overall structure.
 
2. Locate where the surface is smooth and where it is rugged.
 
 Smooth surfaces have little change in Z value over distance while rugged 
surfaces change rapidly over distance.
 
3. Define a sampling strategy (how many samples to take and where to 
take them) based on your understanding of the surface change.
 
 For example, setting a strategy based on surface change may mean that 
you take more samples for rugged surfaces.
Sampling surface data requires you to know something about the surface. 
A general guide is that the more rugged the surface, the more samples you 
need to take because a rugged surface has more changes in Z value than a 
smooth surface. Smooth surfaces have less information (defined as change 
in Z value over horizontal surface) than rugged ones. When you want to rep-
resent a smooth surface, you don’t need to take as many samples to capture 
the information as with a rugged surface.
 
Taking a lot of samples of a surface doesn’t necessarily increase the quality 
of your map. This fact is called the point of diminishing returns. Computer pro-
grams don’t actually need all the data to perform their interpolations, and you 
can reach a point of diminishing returns in which you gain little or no benefit 
by adding more sample points. The software might not even use all the addi-
tional points you provide. Not to mention, taking more samples requires more 
effort, which typically costs money. All that overhead, and you may not even 
improve the quality of your map!
 
Sampling statistical surfaces requires more than just knowledge of where the 
information content is the highest (that is, where there are rapid changes in Z 
value with distance), although that knowledge is extremely important. 

206
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
To define statistical surfaces, you don’t need to provide continuous data 
although there is still the assumption that they are continuous. In some cir-
cumstances, data are collected by region, rather than at specific locations. 
For example, you can sample census data by census tract or census block, 
housing costs by neighborhood, or voter survey data by county. Because 
these types of samples aren’t linked to specific locations on the Earth, you 
need to find a place to locate them if you hope to use them for analysis.
Your GIS software may require you to put a sample location inside each 
polygon if you plan on doing any surface analysis — especially if you plan to 
predict missing values based on the data from the surrounding areas you’ve 
sampled.
Interpolation is the technical term for predicting the Z values of an area based 
on samples that you’ve collected for other areas. For example, if you know 
that you’re standing on a gentle slope at an elevation of 100 feet and your 
friend, who’s 400 feet away from you, is standing at an elevation of 200 feet, 
you can predict the elevation of someone standing halfway between you and 
your friend as 150 feet without actually having to go halfway and measure.
For discrete surfaces, you can use two basic ways to locate points for 
interpolation:
 
✓ By using the centroid (geometric center) of each polygon: For a rectan-
gular polygon, the centroid is right at the intersection of two lines drawn 
diagonally from each corner.
 
✓ By using the center of gravity of the distribution: The center of gravity 
method means that you pick a point that’s closest to the location of the 
highest concentration of your samples.
Figure 13-5 shows the centroid of a polygon and center of gravity of a distri-
bution. Suppose the polygon in the figure is a county, and you want to record 
the number of people who voted in that county. You can assign that number 
to a point in the county — for example, the centroid point could represent 
the number of voters. But if you know that most of the people in the county 
live on the south side, you can move the recording point toward the bottom 
of the polygon (to the center of gravity) so that it more accurately represents 
the distribution.
 
The center of gravity method of interpolation is much more accurate than the 
centroid method, but it also takes more time and requires that you know the 
locations of all your samples. In many cases, you don’t have this information. 
If you do have all the known locations, the GIS places the point at the center of 
gravity. For most applications, especially in which you’re working with small 
polygons, you can adequately represent the data collected for that polygon by 
using the centroid.

Displaying and analyzing Z values
Continuously distributed Z values measured at the interval and ratio scales 
provide a wide array of both display and analytical capabilities. You can find 
displays (basically, anything that shows the output graphically — usually as a 
map) useful for visualizing the nature of the surfaces at a glance, and even for 
comparing some other maps to the surface by using a process called draping.
In draping, the GIS literally drapes layers over the statistical surface. You 
can use this process when you want to see, for example, the relationships 
between vegetation and elevation values. This draping function is visual and 
doesn’t necessarily produce a new map, but when you see common patterns, 
those patterns may suggest a map overlay that you can use to analyze them. 
For information on the techniques of map overlay, see Chapter 17.
Without the need for overlay, statistical surfaces allow you to analyze the 
Z-value data themselves. Continuous data provide information about changes 
in Z value from place to place, directions in those changes, and the rapidity 
with which the change takes place in different portions of your map. With 
some forms of continuous data, you can determine the movements of air, 
water, populations, wildlife, diseases, and many other features. Other forms 
of data allow you to determine whether portions of your study area are vis-
ible from an observation point. You can define watersheds and use them 
for modeling hydrological conditions and deciding where to build bridges. I 
show you the most important of these techniques related to non-topographic 
surfaces in the section “Predicting Values with Interpolation,” later in this 
chapter. In Chapter 15, I show you some of the really powerful tools available 
for topographic statistical surfaces.

208
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Ignoring the rules
You can work with data that are distributed continuously, rather than dis-
cretely, much more effectively when analyzing statistical surfaces. You can 
have difficulties when using non-continuous surfaces because the values 
change suddenly — and not always predictably. Surfaces allow you to predict 
changes, which is one of surfaces’ most useful properties. You might like to 
analyze many distributions, such as those related to population, and eco-
nomic factors so that you can present them as continuous surface displays 
and interpolate missing values.
 
Let me tell you a little secret: If you look carefully at the description of sta-
tistical surface properties in the section “Working with Surface Data,” earlier 
in this chapter, you notice it says, “You can assume that they’re distributed 
continuously.” That part of the description tells you that the data can be 
“assumed” to be continuous because, if you suspend your disbelief (pretend 
they are distributed continuously) for just a bit and wink at the data, you 
can literally ignore the more rigid part of the definition that says they must 
be continuous. So, you can display and analyze maps of population distribu-
tions (discrete data) just as if people really did occur everywhere, as shown 
in Figure 13-6. This assumption of continuity doesn’t cause a problem because 
even truly continuous surfaces are composed of a discrete subset of sample 
points, rather than a potentially infinite number of points.

 Chapter 13: Working with Statistical Surfaces
Predicting Values with Interpolation
You can easily figure out the word interpolation if you just look at the first 
part — in. When you interpolate, you try to predict or estimate missing 
values in-side a set of numbers by using numbers on either side of the gap. 
Interpolation is based on the idea that numbers occur in a predictable fash-
ion or sequence. You could fill in this sequence easily — 10, 20, 30, ??, 50, 60. 
You come up with the value 40 because the numbers don’t occur randomly; 
they exhibit a sequence (each number is 10 more than the previous number).
Surfaces’ values change in sequences. These sequences determine the way 
you predict the missing value. Some sequences for surfaces are smooth and 
steady, and others are rough and undulating. Some sequence of numbers 
can represent each of these types of surfaces, but the sequence might be 
very complex. Some sequences might be linear (such as 1,2,3...) and some 
quite non-linear (for example, logarithmic — rapidly increasing or decreasing 
curves). The interpolation method you choose depends on the nature of the 
surface, as described in the following sections.
Determining values with 
linear interpolation
Linear interpolation is a method of determining missing values that assumes 
the surface you’re examining changes in a regular, arithmetic progression — 
such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Few — if any — natural surfaces satisfy the 
arithmetic progression. Still, it provides the basis for all the other methods. 
Essentially, all methods of interpolation are modifications of the linear method 
based on a combination of both different progressions (number series, such 
as logarithmic) and advanced knowledge of the surface (knowing how Z values 
tend to change over distance).
Linear interpolation is simplicity itself. You place a group of elevation values 
collected by survey or GPS on the map in their exact X and Y locations. From 
there, you can use linear interpolation to determine the elevation at specific 
intervals between two endpoints. Follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the elevation for each endpoint.
 
 In this example, the elevation values are 200 feet at point A and 400 feet 
at point B, as shown in Figure 13-7.
 
2. Measure the horizontal distance between the endpoints.
 
 For this example, the distance between points A and B is 1,000 feet.

210
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
 
3. Determine the total change in elevation between the endpoints.
 
 The surface elevation changes by 200 feet (400 feet minus 200 feet) along 
a distance of 1,000 feet. You assume that the surface elevation for this 
distance changes in a uniform arithmetic fashion.
 
4. Specify uniform intervals between the endpoints.
 
 The surface elevation changes by 20 feet for every distance of 100 feet. 
So, you just need to divide your distance between the two points (A and 
B) into ten 100-foot chunks. 
 
5. Figure the elevation for the point located at any specified interval.
 
 A point that’s three 100-foot chunks (intervals) away from endpoint A 
has an elevation of 260 feet, according to this calculation: 
starting elevation + (number of intervals × elevation 
change per interval) = 
requested elevation
 
 For this example, you’re looking for the elevation at the third interval 
from endpoint A:
200 feet + (3 intervals × 20 feet per interval) = 260 
feet

Using non-linear interpolation
Incline ramps are a classic example of a linearly changing surface. I’ve seen 
many natural areas that are very flat and have a gradual surface incline, but 
even the most uniform of these areas has imperfections and places where the 
surface changes in a different way than the majority of the surface. Because 
you can’t assume that natural surfaces are linear, you need to find methods 
of interpolation that are non-linear.

211
 Chapter 13: Working with Statistical Surfaces
Non-linear methods of surface interpolation try to match the numeric pro-
gressions they use to the progressions that most closely approximate how 
the surface changes. To most effectively decide which of these non-linear 
interpolation methods to employ, you need a close understanding of the 
nature of the surface, including both 
 
✓ A conceptual idea of how the surface looks before you map it
 
✓ A working knowledge of what factors influence how the surface might 
react to changes in other factors.
 
When selecting a non-linear interpolation method, first characterize your sur-
face (gradual, steep, or a combination; smooth, rugged, or some combination). 
Then, become familiar with the nature of the processes at work that cause the 
surface to exist. With this knowledge, you can match the techniques that best 
suit the way the surface changes.
Estimating values with distance-weighted 
interpolation
The weighted-based-on-distance method is more properly called inverse 
distance weighting. The closer things are to each other, the more likely that 
they’re related. So, if you have a bunch of numbers (say from GPS data) that 
you can use to interpolate missing data, the numbers that are closest to 
the missing data probably have more meaning. This method gives a higher 
weight to closer values and less weight to those that are farther away. This 
type of interpolation method (weighted) is one of a growing number of meth-
ods called exact interpolation methods.
Here are some examples of how distance to something affects its importance 
for interpolation:
 
✓ If you need to purchase a single candy bar, do you go to the local conve-
nience store just down the street or travel the 8 miles to the supermar-
ket, where you might save a nickel or a dime?
 
✓ Do you talk to your friends who live 1,000 miles away as much as you 
talk to the people who live in your immediate neighborhood?
 
✓ Your favorite music group is having a concert next week 500 miles away, 
but the same group will be in your city next month. Are you more likely 
to go to the concert at home or 500 miles away?
You can always find exceptions to these examples, but generally, the closer 
you are to your candy bar, your friends, or your favorite rock band, the more 
likely you are to interact with them.

212
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
The same idea applies to surface data. Consider temperature data. If you’re 
standing at one place where the temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 
you take a step to your left, you expect that the temperature is pretty close 
to 75 degrees in that location, as well. But if you get in your car and travel 100 
miles from your original location, you probably don’t expect to find the same 
temperature at your destination.
Knowing the other exact 
interpolation methods
You use exact interpolation when you can’t take the risk of assuming a linear 
change in Z value. The word exact means that many parameters are taken 
into account, such as the relationships of distance to weight of the interpo-
lation. Some exact interpolation methods require the user to define search 
radiuses. Other interpolation methods don’t require the user to define radi-
uses. Some interpolation methods calculate the point at which distance has 
no effect on interpolation (meaning that no relationship apparently exists 
between the surface values that are so far apart).
You can find a comprehensive list of interpolation methods here:
www.spatialanalysisonline.com/output/html/
Comparisonofsamplegriddingandinterpolationmethods.html
The table that you find at this site lists the interpolation method, speed, type, 
and comments that can assist you in deciding which of these methods to use.
 
I find a particular method — called polynomial regression, or more commonly, 
trend surface — quite useful for making surface generalizations. This method 
doesn’t provide an exact prediction of missing values but deviates from exact-
ness to give a general idea of how the slope is trending. You can use this kind 
of trend surface method if you just want a general idea of a surface — and 
the accompanying general trend in a distribution — rather than all the gory 
details.

▶ Working with stream basins
▶ Understanding the relationship of topography to flow
▶ Identifying the parts of a stream
T
opography deals with the configuration of the Earth’s physical surface 
and landforms, their characteristics and locations, and their graphic 
depiction on maps. Topographic surfaces can be flat and uniform, or deeply 
dissected by streams and their associated watersheds or drainage basins 
(areas that drain in the stream). Some topographic surfaces are gentle and 
rolling, moving fluids slowly, and others are rough and steep, causing fluids 
to move rapidly with great erosive force.
You can find a staggering number of forces that create diverse land surfaces, 
as well as different surface types. Fortunately, earth scientists have grouped, 
summarized, and generalized most of these forces and their resulting effects 
to produce some pretty substantial models that you can use. In this chapter, 
I show you three basic groups of models based on topographic surfaces: 
viewshed analysis, basin analysis, and stream morphometry (stream shape 
analysis).
Modeling Visibility with Viewsheds
Analyzing terrain so that you can identify places that are (and aren’t) visible 
from a known location on the earth is called viewshed analysis. Just like a 
watershed is a place where you can find the presence of water, a viewshed is 
a place where you can observe an object in your line of sight. You can ana-
lyze visibility from two perspectives:

214
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
 
✓ Point to point: Analyze visibility from one point to another point. You 
have to know the location of your target point (the place you do or don’t 
want to see) and the location of the observation point where you (the 
observer) are standing.
 
✓ Multiple locations to multiple locations: What if you aren’t staying in 
one place? For example, say that you plan to walk along a mountain trail 
and you want to make sure that — during your walk — you don’t see 
the housing development in the area. Unlike point to point analysis, you 
determine the visibility of multiple locations along the path to multiple 
parts of a housing development. Same problem, same solution — just 
more computing.
The importance of viewshed analysis
You can use the ability to determine what you can and can’t see from 
selected locations in many ways. Military planners use this technology so 
that they can place their troops and equipment in places that are hidden 
from as many locations as possible. Some telecommunications systems 
require line-of-sight analysis so that they can properly place their trans-
mission equipment. In urban areas, city planners like to hide the unsightly 
highways from residents’ view; viewshed analysis helps determine where 
to apply terrain and even vegetation surfaces to solve the problem. In many 
cases, obscuring the view also produces a quieter environment. For exam-
ple, Department of Transportation (DOT) workers erect barriers that both 
obscure and quiet the sound of large highway systems.
Viewshed analysis can tell users where they can see things and where they 
can hide things from view. If you subtract from the map the area that you can 
see, you’re left with the area that you can’t see. One area is the complement 
of the other. Here’s a list of some additional possible ways that you might use 
viewshed analysis:
 
✓ You want to build a resort retreat that’s obscured from the city but pro-
vides a mountain view.
 
✓ You’re putting up billboards along a curvy highway, and you want 
motorists to see the billboards for the longest time possible.
 
✓ You need to know where to place cellular towers so that as many people 
as possible get good reception.
 
✓ You want to know the best place to put your military forward observers 
so that they get the best possible view of the battlefield.
 
✓ You need to set up fire watch stations that see both over the topography 
and over the trees.
 
You may find viewshed analysis helpful in any number of applications. Just 
ask yourself these questions:

215
 Chapter 14: Exploring Topographical Surfaces
 
✓ Will the terrain affect whether I can see certain features?
 
✓ Do I want to see those features or not?
Then, let the GIS work its magic.
Using ray tracing
When you look at topography, you can easily imagine a line drawn from each 
of your eyes to each point in the landscape they view. These lines are iden-
tical to the lines that physicists work with in the study of optical geometry 
(the graphical portrayal of the properties and behavior of light from place 
to place using lines to show how light interacts with objects it encounters). 
They draw lines from a subject’s eyes, through lenses, and to and from 
viewed objects. GIS viewshed analysis uses the same technique. The GIS 
draws lines from the observer to the observed. GIS users call this technique 
ray tracing. The GIS software is literally tracing a line from your observer to 
different locations on the map. Figure 14-1 shows ray tracing in action. Notice 
how the line drawn from the observer to a point on the surface shows places 
that are visible and those that are hidden from sight (shaded).
 
Figure 14-1: 
Simulating

Line of Sight
Not Visible
You can use ray tracing to analyze one line of sight at a time, but you typically 
assess visibility for all possible locations everywhere within the map. By com-
paring one or more observer locations with all other locations, the software 
defines the visible and hidden polygons from a potential observer. You can 
examine visibility over a surface by creating a complete viewshed, such as the 
one in Figure 14-2, but you may also want to make this even more realistic.
The simple approach assumes that you, the observer, are on the ground 
and that you’re searching your topography to see what you can see. This 
approach usually employs only a single layer to analyze, and that layer is 
normally a topographic layer such as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The 
real world is a bit more complicated than this model would suggest, unfortu-
nately. Real landscapes have trees, buildings, and other obstructions. Plus, 
when you observe terrain, you don’t normally lie flat on the ground with your 
eyes at ground level.

216
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
You can easily build these little surface features into your viewshed model. 
If you’re the observer and you’re standing, your eyes are probably anywhere 
from 4 to 6 feet off the ground, depending on your height and the shoes 
you’re wearing. So, if you’re working with a topographic model and have 
no vegetation or buildings to get in the way, you need to adjust only for the 
height of your eyes from the ground. To make that adjustment, you just add 
that height value — say, 5 feet — to the observer’s elevation. If you’re observ-
ing from a tall building or a lighthouse, add that additional height to the exist-
ing elevation at your observer’s location. You also account for obstructions 
such as trees in the exact same way. Just add their heights to their locations’ 
elevations. Figure 14-3 shows the line of sight for an elevated observer and or 
when obstructions block the way.
 
The most accurate viewshed models add the heights of obstructions from 
data in other map layers, as well as from the observer’s height. Most of the 
time, though, you don’t know the observer’s height, and your elevation model 
isn’t accurate enough for these minor improvements to make a huge differ-
ence. Use these refinements only when you have very good elevation data and 
a thorough knowledge of the observer and the obstructions.

Finding and Using Basins
You can find analyzing stream configuration useful for characterizing the 
flows along these networks (as I talk about in Chapter 15), but you can do 
much more with the terrain models inside your GIS. For example, you can 
analyze what the watershed or basin within which your streams reside actu-
ally looks like. The basin determines the nature of your stream, and the basin 
also controls water accumulation (which I discuss in the section “Working 
with basins in your GIS,” later in this chapter).
These three metrics — stream ordering, basin analysis, and water 
accumulation — are all inextricably linked to one another. You can’t really do 
stream ordering until you can define the stream based on a thorough knowl-
edge of the basin. When you have a complete model of the basin, you can 
finally model the movement and accumulation of water.
Knowing how basins work
Think about what happens in a basin, whether a washbasin or a stream basin. 
When water enters the basin from above, that water immediately begins to 
seek its way downhill because of gravity. Water acts differently, depend-
ing on whether a basin is steep or shallow. Steep basins tend to have really 
sharp cuts in them because the water is moving so much faster than it does 
in a shallow basin and therefore cuts deeply into the surface. The software 
must define the movement of water based on the shape of the basin. You 
usually begin with a set of elevation data from some source, such as a Digital 
Elevation Model (DEM).

218
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
 
Basins or watersheds are composed of the area upslope from the stream net-
work in such a way that all the water landing on the watershed could poten-
tially flow overland into that stream network.
Working with basins in your GIS
To define both streams and the basins in which they reside, you must first 
develop a grid (set of grid cells) that illustrates where the water would accu-
mulate if you filled the basin with water. The accumulation is really a mea-
sure of distance based on where the water will go. The deeper the basin, the 
deeper the potential water accumulation. These deep areas are near the cen-
tral trunk stream (the large stream in the center). Shallow parts of the basin 
are typically near the tributaries (the branches from the central stream) 
because water accumulates through movement from tributary streams and 
from overland flow.
Like with all topographic surfaces, a basin (a low landform associated with a 
stream network) can include many little depressions and peaks. The GIS can 
model these differences but the process is unnecessarily complicated. In this 
discussion, I pretend that my surface has no minor variations. This depres-
sionless surface allows for the development of a general model. You can most 
effectively model stream basins by using a raster GIS, as I do in this section.
After building your topographic database, you can create a model of the grid 
surface. The highest grid cells — the ones on the outside margin of your 
basin — define the basin’s boundaries. The section “Finding and quantifying 
streams,” later in this chapter, discusses how the lowest grid cells for each 
sub-basin (a part of the basin associated with a tributary stream) form the 
cells that make up the stream network. The places where the stream grid 
cells form each sub-basin are called pour points because, at these locations, 
water pours from one sub-basin to another.
You want to identify the location of the watershed boundaries mainly so that 
you can model the accumulation of water while it flows downslope into the 
basin itself. While you move from the highest elevations, each grid cell con-
tributes water to the total water moving downslope. Because each grid cell 
downslope receives the water from the grid cell above, the values accumulate.
The more grid cells upslope, the larger the values at the bottom (as shown 
in Figure 14-4). The left part of the diagram shows the elevation values, the 
right shows the direction the flow will move based on those values. The GIS 
records these directions as a series of codes (shown at the bottom of Figure 
14-4) based on direction. So, for example, a flow to the right would be coded 
a value of 1, a flow to the left would be 16, and so on.

Direction Coding
Elevation
Flow Direction
In this simplified version of how the accumulation model works, each grid 
cell usually has additional attributes that include values such as the amount 
of precipitation, and absorption rate of the surface over which the water 
moves. These values are similar to the friction values that you use when you 
measure functional distance, as discussed in Chapter 12. The GIS can include 
these values for more sophisticated modeling operations by adding both the 
cells and the friction values while the accumulation proceeds.
Characterizing Flow
Watersheds are pretty irregular in elevation values, even if you ignore the 
occasional highs and lows in the surface. These irregularities result in water 
moving in different directions. When you add differential surfaces to your GIS 
database, you can build some really powerful models of flow direction. The 
following sections show you the basics of how flow direction works.
Knowing the importance of flow
The direction of the movement of liquids downhill determines where ero-
sion is likely to take place, how quickly the water will move, and the moving 
water’s possible destructive force if important structures happen to be in its 
path. People build many structures in floodplains and basins. While water 

220
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
moves down slopes, it not only increases in speed and force, it also saturates 
surfaces, dislodges portions of those surfaces, and picks up debris that con-
tribute to the potential for damage.
Modeling and using flow
To determine flow direction, you need a grid of elevation values, such as a 
Digital Elevation Model (DEM). You evaluate each grid cell by comparing its 
elevation value to that of its neighbors. In Figure 14-5, the GIS compares each 
of the outside grid-cell elevation values to the center (target) cell. After it 
determines which cell has the highest drop in elevation, it assigns that cell a 
code that indicates the direction of water movement.

In Figure 14-5, the input grid shows an elevation value for each of the nine 
grid cells. By using the center grid cell’s value as the starting point (essen-
tially, where the water is at that time) and comparing it to each of its eight 
neighbors, the computer tries to find elevation values lower than the starting 
grid cell (in this case, the center). If the elevation values are higher than the 
starting cell, the computer moves to values that are lower. GIS software pack-
ages handle similar surrounding values differently but normally perform a 
search beyond the immediate neighborhood of cells. The GIS software looks 
for the direction of steepest descent, meaning the one neighboring grid cell 
that has the steepest drop in elevation from the starting cell. In Figure 14-5, 
the grid cell in the upper-left corner has the largest elevation drop to the cen-
tral grid cell of all the eight neighbors.
To let the computer know that the largest elevation drop is in the upper-
left corner, you need to give the flow a direction value. Depending on your 
software, the eight possible direction values could start on the top, bottom, 

221
 Chapter 14: Exploring Topographical Surfaces
left, or right. The ESRI software uses the output values shown in Figure 14-6 
for direction. Direction coding starts at the right (east) with a value of 1 and 
moves clockwise, doubling the value it uses for each sequential grid cell. This 
scheme was decided for programming reasons (that you don’t need to worry 
about), so just realize that the coding scheme reduces the number of direc-
tion numbers from 360 compass directions to only a handful.

You may want to know which way the water is going to flow, but if you also 
want to get a feel for how fast that water will move, you need to measure the 
distance it will cover. This general model for flow is calculated with a very 
simple formula:
Flow = Change in Z value/(distance × 100)
On a 3-x-3 grid, a GIS compares each beginning (center) cell’s elevation value 
to each of its neighbor cells. The GIS also measures distance in this way:
 
✓ Cells that share a side with the center cell have a distance of 1.
 
✓ Cells diagonal to the center cell have a distance of 1.414.
Some strange situations can occur when the computer determines flow direc-
tion and distance. For example, all the neighbor grid-cell elevation values 
may be higher than the starting cell, or several grid cells may all have the 
lowest elevation drop. Different GIS packages have different ways of dealing 
with these issues, including some unique coding schemes and (my favorite) 
allowing the program to expand its search beyond the initial eight grid cells 
to find an appropriate drain point. I like this expanded-search approach 
because it allows the program to evaluate elevation values that are more 
likely to be different than those immediate eight cells.

222
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Defining Streams
The stream is a very common land feature. Streams usually don’t occur in 
isolation. They usually have a lot of branching tributaries. The numbers and 
positions of streams have an impact on stream flow, water accumulation 
from overland flow, and even the ecological conditions of the streams and 
the upland corridor (often called a riparian corridor).
In vector GIS, you can find streams basically by selecting the appropriate line 
entities based on their labels. After you know the locations of the streams, 
you can measure the complexity and configuration of the network so that you 
can understand the processes at work in that network. Defining streams in a 
raster GIS takes a bit of work, which I outline in the following sections.
Finding and quantifying streams
Raster GIS contains some of the most powerful analysis related to streams 
and their landforms because of the raster data model’s capacity to easily rep-
resent every piece of the topographic surface. To perform stream morphom-
etry (a way to model how tributary streams connect to bigger streams to 
make stream networks), you first need to define the locations of the streams 
and their watersheds (areas that drain into the stream, as shown in Figure 
14-7). These locations are related to elevation. Streams mark the low spots in 
the drainage basin area, and all the parts of the watershed must be at higher 
elevations than the adjacent part of the stream network so that the water will 
drain into the streams.
GIS
 
Ecologists like to be able to model stream connections because those connec-
tions provide clues about the biological organisms that exist both on the land 
and in the streams. Geomorphologists (scientists who study landforms) use 
this information to understand how the streams will change over time through 
the processes of erosion and deposition. Most GIS software includes the well-
established methods of stream morphometry.
To determine where the streams are in a watershed, use topographic charac-
teristics that define how the stream works by following these basic steps:
 
1. Define the outside edge of the basin and its sub-basins as the locally 
highest locations in the map.
 
2. Define the pour points (the low points) for each sub-basin.
 
 Each pour point forms a junction or branching for the stream.
 
3. Calculate the least elevation surface values upward from the pour 
point to find the locations of the streams

223
 Chapter 14: Exploring Topographical Surfaces

Pour points
Basin

Tributary stream
The stream branchings at the pour points allow you to determine stream 
morphometry by providing the skeleton of your basin. When you calculate 
accumulation and define basins (as discussed in the section “Finding and 
Using Basins,” earlier in this chapter), you identify the stream network. A 
GIS assigns grid cell values to reflect water accumulation (which I talk about 
in the section “Characterizing Flow,” earlier in this chapter). The grid cells 
with the highest values, called the stream cells, represent the actual stream. 
You can reassign these high values to be any number you want so that you 
can identify where the stream is located. To make these cells stand out even 
more, most GIS software assigns all the other background (non-stream) cells 
a value of NODATA, which tells the computer that the background cells have 
no numbers assigned to them at all.
 
I like to assign numbers to stream cells that are wildly different from any 
values that might occur anywhere else in the database. For example, if you 
know that your non-stream cells’ values won’t be bigger than 100 during the 
accumulation calculations, you can assign a value of 200 for stream cells. You 
can always renumber the stream cells after you classify all the background 
cells as NODATA.
After locating the stream, you need to perform a stream-order analysis. 
Sometimes called the bifurcation ratio because the streams tend to break in 
twos, the stream-order analysis calculates the relative locations and connec-
tions of a stream network, characterized by the order in which the streams 
come together. First-order streams, for example, are commonly the smallest 
outside tributaries whose water comes only from overland flow and not from 
other streams.

224
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Identifying methods that work for you
You can calculate stream order in several ways, but the two most common 
are the Strahler method and the Shreve method. Both of these methods use 
the exterior link as the first-order stream link and assign these stream tribu-
taries a value of 1 (representing first order), as shown in Figure 14-8:
 
✓ Strahler method: The most common method. Each new stream order 
is based on the convergence of two streams that have identical stream-
order numbers. When dissimilar stream orders come together, the com-
puter assigns the higher of the two tributaries’ orders to the next stream 
tributary.
 
 For example, you can use the Strahler method for studies involving sedi-
ment movement and stream flow analysis.
 
✓ Shreve method: Adds the stream orders together to produce the next 
stream-order number, thus accounting for all possible stream-order 
combinations. You call these numbers stream magnitudes, rather than 
orders, because the values aren’t based solely on the ordering.
 
 Ecologists use the Shreve method to reflect how the different stream 
linkages often result in considerably different ecological conditions.
 
You can use stream order to define buffer distances because a GIS codes these 
numbers right into the links themselves.

Some software uses different methods to determine stream ordering — 
but most of those different methods are really variations on a theme. The 
Strahler and Shreve methods are the most common approaches to this type 
of stream drainage analysis.
 
Before you start doing work with stream-network analysis, check your soft-
ware documentation. It usually describes in detail how the methods work and 
may even provide suggestions for selecting a method.

Working with Networks
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out how connected a network is
▶ Working with impedance values
▶ Accounting for directions of movement in linear features
▶ Modeling circuits, turns, and intersections
▶ Putting it all together to model and route traffic
T
he Earth is filled with linear objects. You can find treelines, fault zones, 
shorelines, fences, rows of houses — the list goes on. Some linear 
objects are special not so much because of what they are, but how they 
work. These special linear objects are called networks. Networks are col-
lections of connected linear objects such as roads, railroads, or rivers that 
branch from place to place. They come in different sizes, numbers of branch-
ings, and angular configurations. One classic type of network is the stream 
network, which allows movement of water along its length. A network that 
has this movement along its length is called a corridor. This chapter covers 
the different properties of corridors and shows you how to measure them.
Measuring Connectivity
You can measure connectivity in a network by comparing the number of 
actual node-to-node links that exist in a given network to the maximum 
number of nodes that are possible. This measure of connectivity is called the 
gamma index. Usually, the index ranges from a value of 0 (which indicates 
no connected links at all) to 1 (where all possible links are connected). Both 
general and transportation-specific GIS software packages contain algorithms 
that allow you to calculate the gamma index, which the software records as 
decimal values.

226
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Recognizing the importance of connectivity
The gamma index gives you a way to determine whether the network is as 
connected as possible. I once used this index to model the speed at which 
edge species (species that like to live on the edges of different types of 
environments) would inhabit a network based on whether that network was 
poorly, moderately, or highly connected. But most applications of the gamma 
index relate to human transportation systems.
If you look at a road map of the conterminous United States (the lower 48 
states), you may notice that the central portion of the country (the Great 
Plains) has far fewer road-to-town connections than do the coasts. Most of 
the coastal areas are highly connected so that each town has many connected 
links. In other words, the coasts have a gamma index that’s approaching 1. In 
the Great Plains, many towns aren’t connected directly to some nearby roads, 
forcing you to take longer routes to get from place to place. Thus the gamma 
index for road networks in the Great Plains would be closer to 0.
Measuring and using connectivity
A GIS calculates the gamma index by counting all possible connections 
(links) among all the nodes in the database and then dividing this total (the 
number of actual links) by the maximum number of possible links. You use 
the gamma index connectivity figure indirectly when you perform shortest-
path analysis (covered in the section “Finding the shortest path,” later in this 
chapter), but it can also be useful for
 
✓ Characterizing the loss of shelterbelt networks: Shelterbelt networks 
are rows of planted, fast growing trees that you use primarily to protect 
crops from the negative effects of wind. By evaluating the gamma index 
of shelterbelts, you can begin to plan which regions need the most 
urgent replantings of trees to replace those that are dead.
 
✓ Evaluating increases in road network connections over time: Check 
out Figure 15-1, where the dots represent towns and the connecting lines 
represent roads. From left to right, the three networks illustrate how the 
number of connections among the towns increases while time passes 
and more roads are built. This increase in connectivity may indicate 
increased urbanization.
 
✓ Analyzing the complexity and efficiency of utility networks: Like 
roads, utility networks provide for flows, but the flows are of electric-
ity, gas, or water. The more connected the utilities are, the more homes 
they can serve. Some utilities, such as electrical service, often require 
that substations be appropriately placed to ensure that, if one goes 
down, others can still provide electricity to all the customers. Analysis 
to determine appropriate placement is essentially one of connectivity.

Working with Impedance Values
When you treat networks as corridors, the movement of fluids, objects, ani-
mals, and/or vehicles is your primary concern. For any movement, the nature 
of the network as a corridor has an impact on how fast things move and in 
some cases, even whether they move at all. The resistance to movement is 
called impedance and can be a function of the size of pipeline in a water deliv-
ery system, the roughness of dirt or gravel roads, or the number of lanes in 
highways. The most common use of network impedance is to model street 
patterns for transportation routing. I use that example in the following sec-
tions to show you how network impedance works.
Knowing when your paths are fast or slow
GIS
 
Street patterns provide an excellent example of how factors can affect speed 
in a network. Speed may increase or decrease for several reasons. Here’s a 
quick list:
 
✓ Posted speed limits help determine the maximum travel speeds for 
streets and highways (sometimes even the minimum speeds).
 
✓ Fluctuations in traffic density often determine how fast the traffic will 
move at different times of the day.
 
✓ Accidents and other unplanned disruptions are bound to slow traffic, 
especially if lanes are closed off.
 
✓ Street repairs and changes in road condition often result in changes in 
traffic flow.
 
✓ The existence of border checks, sobriety checkpoints, weigh stations, 
and other regulatory facilities result in slower traffic flow.
 
✓ Changes in weather, especially the existence of dust storms, rain- and 
hailstorms, blizzards, and sleet storms will often have huge impacts on 
traffic flow.

228
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Modeling impedance for traffic flow
Given the many factors that affect the movement of flow, especially traffic flow 
on streets, modeling these changes really improves your ability to know when 
your grocery deliveries will arrive, how fast a fire engine can get to a fire, the 
fastest way to get to a particular restaurant for dinner, or the route that you 
might need to take to pick up your children from their many activities.
When you model impedance, you do have to deal with one complexity — 
most software gives you many options. And you simply won’t use some of 
those options because they require that you know much more about your 
traffic network than you probably do. Ever see those little black traffic coun-
ters (they look like rather large power cords) running across your streets 
from time to time? Traffic engineers and transportation geographers use 
these counters to determine how much traffic flows past a particular point at 
any given time. You could easily include this important information in your 
GIS as impedance data. Other common traffic-flow impedance data include 
speed limits, stoplights, and stop signs.
Here’s a short list of some of the attributes, or options, that you can put into 
a GIS impedance layer that you might use for traffic modeling (this list omits 
data related to turns, which I discuss in the section “Working with Turns and 
Intersections,” later in this chapter):
 
✓ Impedance attribute: How long it normally takes to travel a certain 
distance.
 
✓ Default cutoff value: The value at which the computer stops searching 
for a location. You can override or change this value.
 
✓ Accumulation information: A list of possible attributes that accumulate 
while distance increases, including costs, students riding a bus, and 
many more.
 
✓ Restrictions: Restrictions that you place on the use of links (for exam-
ple, the permitted types of traffic on portions of your road network). 
For example, you can choose to force hazardous cargo to use certain 
streets.
 
✓ Hierarchy: A set of rules for travel, regardless of how your software 
determines the impedance values.
These factors (and others that depend on the software you use) are some-
times referred to as the Origin-Destination (OD) matrix. The data for these 
factors form a separate table. When you use the GIS for transportation model-
ing, the software compares the network by examining the OD matrix so that 
it knows the rules to apply and where to apply them. The OD matrix contains 
several components, including origin, destination, and barrier information. 

229
 Chapter 15: Working with Networks
By reading the OD matrix, the software knows the ID codes you have placed 
at strategic locations, how to read the impedances you have linked to those 
ID codes, and other necessary factors that give you the power to simulate 
how real traffic flows operate.
 
Use your knowledge of traffic patterns and impedances to decide which actual 
values to include in the OD matrix. For example, your matrix entries will 
reflect attributes such as speed limits for roads, maximum flow capacity for 
water in a pipeline network, or the amount of electrical resistance you might 
get from a particular type of wire in an electrical utility network.
Working with One-Way Paths
Impedances, like surface friction values, can be low or high, short distances 
or long, and even prevent movement entirely. Dead ends, checkpoints, and 
bridge collapses prevent the movement of travel. You model these imped-
ances by placing no-movement commands at these points. However, you 
can restrict movement only to one direction by creating unidirectional (or 
one-way) paths.
Understanding unidirectional paths
In certain situations, travel along a network normally takes place only in a 
given direction. A fast-moving stream moves rafts in only one direction. Some 
gate entries allow traffic to move in only one way and out another for control — 
some gates even place those nasty spikes to rip up your tires if you try to 
back up. The most common example of a unidirectional path is the one-way 
street. I focus on that example in the following section because it’s easy to 
understand and modeled frequently in transportation GIS applications.
Modeling unidirectional paths
If you want to move ambulances, fire engines, or even grocery trucks, you 
usually look at a map to figure out the best way to get from point A to point 
B. More than one argument between friends or spouses has begun over dis-
agreements about which path to use. Perhaps you should purchase some GIS 
software for your friends and loved ones to reduce these disagreements. How 
would GIS software help? The software is pretty adept at handling the fac-
tors that influence travel through a network. One of the most common (and 
aggravating) situations that street maps don’t often show is the location and 
direction of one-way streets.

230
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
One-way streets are coded in a GIS by including a travel direction restriction 
in your OD matrix. When the computer tries to model vehicle access to a 
north-directed one-way street from the south, or even to make turns into it in 
the opposite direction, the GIS stops the movement and redirects the search 
to look elsewhere for a path. In essence, the effect is the same as when you 
put up a barricade across the street that prevents travel in that direction 
(see Figure 15-2).

Characterizing Circuitry
A network’s complexity is partly measured by the numbers of links it has com-
pared to the maximum number it could have (the gamma index). One other 
factor both characterizes the complexity of a network and adds to the robust-
ness of traffic modeling capabilities. That characteristic, called circuitry, is 
based on the idea of closed loops. Closed loops allow moving objects, fluids, 
and so forth to travel alternate routes when moving along a network (see 
Figure 15-3). The following sections show how closed loops work.
Knowing when lines create circuits
If you’re modeling streams, you may encounter a location where a stream 
splits around an island and can move in two different directions. In forests, 
some wildlife takes advantage of circuits to avoid predators because the prey 

231
 Chapter 15: Working with Networks
identifies more than one path that they can use to escape. British-designed 
road systems provide another classic example of circuits with their intersec-
tion roundabouts. In the United States, the interstate bypass system allows 
you to travel around major urban areas without dealing with slower intra-
urban traffic.
When you perform traffic analysis for routing, allocating customers or bus 
riders, or finding the nearest facility, having circuits greatly increases your 
route options. In some cases, the routes may be longer but could save travel 
time because of reduced traffic and less traffic-related impedances.
Measuring and modeling circuits
The algorithm for modeling circuitry is very similar to the one you use for 
network connectivity (which I discuss in the earlier section “Measuring and 
using connectivity”). Rather than a gamma index, you use another ratio 
called the alpha index. In transportation geography, the alpha index is used 
to characterize the amount of circuitry. The alpha index, like the gamma 
index, is a ratio. In the alpha index, the ratio compares the actual number 
of circuits (loops in a network composed of nodes and links) divided by the 
maximum circuits possible. Like with the gamma index, both general and 
transportation-specific GIS software has the alpha index built in for you.
Although you may find having an index of circuitry handy to characterize 
areas, GIS users more commonly use networks for traffic-pattern analysis. 
You treat the loop just like any other connection inside the GIS. So, these 
loops provide alternatives for movement, and you don’t have to do any addi-
tional work to set them up or model with them.

also called a 
closed loop.

232
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Working with Turns and Intersections
Whether your network database has circuits or just different sets of branches, 
you sometimes must turn or cross another branch that intersects your path. 
You have to make some turns at right angles, some at acute angles, and some 
at obtuse angles. You may even encounter a link that meets a dead end or a T 
that offers two possible directions. These different types of linkage provide an 
array of alternative movements that the GIS can handle.
Recognizing the importance 
of turns and intersections
When you plan a trip, you need to know where you’re starting, where you’re 
going, what the traffic will probably be like, which roads or streets you must 
take, and where you turn from street to street. Some routes may require you 
to travel more distance than other routes. Some routes have stoplights that 
slow your movement. Although your map may not show it, some streets are 
one-way streets — and those streets might lead to your destination or might 
flow one way in the wrong direction. Turning from two-way streets to one-
way streets means that the turns themselves also restrict your movement by 
forcing you into specific lanes on which you can travel.
Stoplights, stop signs, and different types of street intersections all either 
add or detract from your travels. Planning a trip means more than just look-
ing at the lines on a map and tracing the shortest route. One time-saving trick 
I like to use is to plan a trip where I make only right-hand turns. Experience 
has taught me that cutting across traffic (with left-hand turns) can be difficult 
and time-consuming because you must wait for an opening to get across.
Because you no longer have to rely on a static, hardcopy road map, you can 
include knowledge about what factors speed travel and what factors slow it 
down when you travel along a road network. The more compete this informa-
tion, and the more accurately it represents how intersections and turns work, 
the more likely you can accurately model traffic. The key to successful traffic 
network modeling, then, is getting all the right information into the computer.
Encoding and using turns 
and intersections
You can code turns for any junction where edges connect. The number of 
edges connecting at each junction limits the number of possible turns. The 
maximum number of turns is the number of edges n squared, or n2. You can 

233
 Chapter 15: Working with Networks
even model a single edge where your maximum number of turns is one, (12 = 1). 
Figure 15-4 shows graphically how this formula works with a T intersection 
composed of three links.
When you have three links (or edges), squaring that number tells you that 
you have nine possible movements, including U turns and straight-through 
(non-turn) movements, as follows:
 
✓ Three U turns: Each edge provides an opportunity to do a U-turn if you 
allow it.
 
✓ Two right turns and two left turns: The link coming down from the top 
allows you to make right turns along the inside lane, and left turns to the 
outside lane.
 
✓ Two non-turns: The links on the bottom allow you to go straight 
through, or turn into the vertical link from the right or the left, depend-
ing on your approach.
Turns are defined by rules that affect conditions in which two edges come 
together. Every GIS employs some set of rules that govern how and where 
you can make turns. These rules will likely reflect the terminology used in 
your GIS software package, but, in general, GIS turn rules give you these 
restrictions:
 
✓ You can’t set up turns that include impossible movements or seriously 
violate traffic laws.
 
✓ You can create U-turns, but you can turn that ability off if, for example, 
U-turns aren’t legal.
Some software stores turn information as network datasets, and others use 
turn tables that include a field for adding a turn impedance (see the section 
“Working with Impedance Values,” earlier in this chapter). Turn impedance 
values, which network datasets also include, give you the opportunity to 
include the amount of time it would normally take to perform a turn with traf-
fic or against it. So, you can model vehicular movement very realistically.

Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Directing Traffic and 
Exploiting Networks
Networks provide a selection of really useful techniques that you can employ 
in businesses, government, organizations, emergency services, and many 
other applications. After you add to your GIS a complete network that has 
appropriate road designations and ID codes for your impedance values, the 
impedance values themselves, plus turn information, you have one of the 
most powerful networking tools available anywhere. Here’s a quick list of the 
operations you can use in most GIS software:
 
✓ Finding the best route (shortest, fastest, or even the most scenic)
 
✓ Finding the closest geographic feature to you
 
✓ Finding service areas, such as what parts of town are served by a single 
fire station
Finding the shortest path, or route
Many people use street maps to figure out the shortest route from their cur-
rent location to some specified location. If you search for the shortest path, 
you use the length of the network links to decide the best route. Because 
you’re not concerned with time, you don’t need to include impedance values 
in your search. Although the GIS ignores most impedance values when you 
specify that they aren’t needed, the software always includes some indication 
of one-way streets and dead ends so that it doesn’t send you on a wild goose 
chase.
Most GIS use several algorithms to determine the shortest path, but most of 
these algorithms look at a number of alternate routes and choose the short-
est. One common method of shortest path search is called the best first algo-
rithm, which takes the shortest path available at each step. Other algorithms 
try a number of alternatives at predetermined distances and select the best. 
Consult your software documentation for more detail, but most of these tech-
niques provide pretty good results.
 
Even if you don’t own a complete professional GIS, you may have already seen 
this ability to find the shortest path in action. Yahoo! Maps and Google Maps 
find the shortest path from one town to another or one address to another. 
These packages are rudimentary GIS software and do a reasonable job for gen-
eral routing tasks. For detailed, time-critical routing, especially for business 
and emergency services, these packages typically don’t include the detail that 
you need to efficiently navigate through road networks, especially during criti-
cal times of the day like rush hour.

235
 Chapter 15: Working with Networks
Both the rudimentary packages and the more sophisticated GIS software pro-
vide two forms of output. The first form is a map that shows a highlighted ver-
sion of the route. You can expand this map to a turn-by-turn map that includes 
a text version of exactly how far each leg of the route is, exactly where the 
turns are, and which direction you turn (like the example in Figure 15-5).
 
The shortest path means shortest in terms of distance traveled. If you want to 
get there fast, use the fastest-route feature of your GIS (see the next section 
for more on this feature).
Finding the shortest route to one destination is pretty handy, but you can 
also use the GIS to find the closest of a group of possible destinations, as 
well. You’ve probably used this kind of feature when you wanted to find the 
closest Sears or Wal-Mart store by using the store’s Web site. The software 
finds the addresses of all the possible locations and performs a shortest-path 
analysis on all of them from your current location. Businesses have found 
that providing interactive maps directing traffic to their front door (so to 
speak) is a really powerful marketing tool.
 
Figure 15-5: 
A turn-by-
turn map

Finding the fastest path
The shortest way from one place to another isn’t always the fastest, as 
shown in Figure 15-6. For example, you might be able to get from the south-
east corner to the northwest corner of a big city much faster by taking the 

236
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
interstate around the city, rather than taking the shorter diagonal route. The 
shorter diagonal route includes slow speed limits, traffic congestion, stop 
signs, stoplights, and a host of other possible impedances.
The fastest-path search allows your GIS to start from one location and accu-
mulate impedance values while it searches through the network to find your 
destination. Instead of keeping track of just distance, it combines distance 
and impedance to calculate the route that has the least amount of total 
impedance. Typically, GIS software measures impedance in time, so a street 
that has a 25 mile-per-hour speed limit has a higher impedance value (longer 
time) than one that has a 75 mile-per-hour speed limit.
 
You can use the fastest-route search method for another useful search. If you 
know where you’re starting but don’t know your destination, the GIS can find 
your destination for you. Okay, the GIS isn’t going to find the perfect picnic 
spot or the best restaurant unless you give it a clue. Perhaps you have a sick 
family member and you need to get him or her to the hospital. If your town 
has four or five hospitals, the GIS can search for the closest one. You need 
to tell the software that you want it to find the fastest path to all the selected 
hospitals in your area and the fastest of those is the one you would select.
 
Figure 15-6: 
The shortest 
path versus 
the fastest 
path.
 
Fastest Path
Shortest Path

237
 Chapter 15: Working with Networks
One aspect of the fastest-path approach is a bit unique because your imped-
ance values are based not just on speed limits, impedances, and typical traf-
fic volumes, but also on the time of day. Some construction zones operate at 
different times of day, traffic congestion is worse during rush hours, and even 
the season might impact which roads are open. Encode in the OD matrix the 
times of day when traffic is congested on which streets to make sure that the 
software can determine how drivers can avoid those streets at those times. 
In some hilly cities and towns, selected streets are blocked off at times in 
winter because the snow and ice make those streets dangerous to drive. You 
can code all sorts of impedances as windows of time along selected portions 
of the network and store them in an attribute table, as shown in Figure 15-7.
 
Figure 15-7:

Finding the nicest path
You may be concerned about factors other than speed or distance. Many 
highways have scenic routes that are a bit slower or perhaps even longer 
than a more direct route, but you may want to view the scenery. GIS software 
can help you find the scenic routes, as well as the fastest and most direct 
routes, because you can create scenic impedance values. When you run your 
search, you simply ask the GIS to search for links that have the nicest scen-
ery. You just need to remember to include the values that you want to search 
for in your network database attributes.
Finding the service areas
The network database allows you to create all sorts of values to put into your 
tables. You can include distance, impedance, turning, and even scenic infor-
mation. One really powerful tool for service providers and businesses alike is 
the ability to find service areas.
A service area identifies places that are within a reasonable distance for use 
and relies on knowing how many people or houses are located along indi-
vidual links in a network, much like impedance values, except that the data-
base has to know how many people are along each link. The software starts 

238
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
at some point location and searches either along a chosen path or outward in 
all directions. While it searches, it counts all the houses or people it passes 
until it reaches the end of the database, some specified search radius, or 
some maximum quantity of people or houses.
GIS
 
You may find the service area tool useful in a number of different settings. 
Here’s a list of some common uses:
 
✓ Creating bus routes for school children, limiting the search by the 
number of passenger seats on the bus
 
✓ Determining how many fire stations a town needs, based on a search of 
the number of homes one fire station can safely service (based on his-
torical numbers of fires and other factors) in a worst-case scenario
 
✓ Marketing to potential newspaper subscribers based on an accumulated 
search of households that don’t currently subscribe to your paper
 
✓ Creating service areas in which a pizza delivery store can deliver pizzas 
within an assigned time period
Figure 15-8 shows the results of a search that returns all areas in a portion 
of a city that a driver can reach within five minutes. Service-area analysis 
allows you to use all the impedance and turning tools that you use for any 
other analysis. This process of finding service areas, often called allocation 
by geographers, is a very popular tool among business analysts because they 
can not only allocate for their own facility, but also compare themselves to 
their competition. Allocation is one of the more popular economic placement 
tools available in GIS today.

Comparing Multiple Maps
In This Chapter
▶ Looking into map overlay
▶ Comparing polygons with logical overlay
▶ Understanding the advantages of raster overlay
▶ Using selective overlay to compare features
G
eographers have been aware for generations that spatial patterns 
sometimes repeat themselves. The usefulness of comparing these 
spatial patterns has been documented as far back as the Revolutionary War 
when General George Washington’s French cartographer made multiple 
hinged maps that showed the locations of both British and American armies 
in the corresponding geographic area. This idea probably goes back as far as 
maps themselves.
In the early 1960s, the idea of using computers to make maps brought with it 
a renewed interest in comparing multiple map patterns. Landscape architects 
used clear acetate to physically overlay and compare maps manually with a 
fair degree of success. Urban and regional planners found comparing differ-
ent maps essential to the observation, quantification, explanation, and even-
tual exploitation of multiple patterns.
Even before map overlay came into use, people observed patterns occurring 
in the data contained on various maps for an area. Auto thefts happen in 
locations that have cars, shopping happens in areas that have stores, roads 
connect towns, vegetation responds to different soil types and different 
slopes, cities mostly occur near water, certain wildlife prefer selected vegeta-
tion, people of similar income tend to live in the same areas, and so on. You 
can observe each of these coincident patterns both in the field and on maps. 
You can analyze the degree to which the patterns correspond, and figure out 
whether cause and effect relationships exist, much more easily if you can 
overlay the maps.

240
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
This chapter shows you the three main ways to compare multiple maps. I 
show you how you can use mathematics and formal logic to make the com-
parisons. You see how overlay works in raster and vector data models, and 
how to use selective overlay to compare particular features across maps.
Exploring Methods of Map Overlay
The ability to overlay maps was a primary driving force during the early 
development of GIS software. Initially, overlay functions focused on compar-
ing one set of polygons to another, but they quickly expanded to comparing 
polygons with point and line features. For people, overlaying one map on 
another is a pretty simple concept involving a visual and intellectual interpre-
tation process. But getting a computer to do the overlay is a bit more com-
plicated because the interpretation process can take several forms and may 
even combine different methods. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about 
these details because the methods have been formalized into some very 
structured approaches in the GIS software.
 
All professional GIS software has some form of overlay toolkit that allows you 
to choose among different methods of overlay and select the layers you want 
to use. Most GIS toolkits have a separate graphical user interface or offer a 
button, icon, or tool to click that, in turn, gives you a lot of choices. Check 
your user manual or type help overlay in your software’s help utility.
Knowing the overlay methods available helps you find the right tools in your 
own software. Map overlay operations compare three pairings of geographic 
feature types:
 
✓ Points to polygons
 
✓ Lines to polygons
 
✓ Polygons to polygons
The first two pairings, points to polygons and lines to polygons, use a presence/
absence overlay method. In other words, either the points or lines coincide 
with (occur in or run through) a particular type of polygon or they don’t. 
This method is actually a little more complicated than that (as I explain in the 
following sections), but not much.
The last pairing — polygon to polygon — introduces some additional poten-
tial methods of comparison that, to some degree or another, simulate the 
intellectual process of visual map overlay. Each method is adapted to either 
raster or vector GIS data models, as I describe in the following sections.

241
 Chapter 16: Comparing Multiple Maps
Finding points in polygons
Point features occur in many different places at different times for different rea-
sons. You might want to identify where and to what extent (for example, how 
many) selected point objects occur within the boundaries of area features. And 
guess what? You can do just that with ease by using either a raster or vector 
GIS model. Table 16-1 shows a selection of questions that you might ask to 
identify whether features you’re interested in occur in the same locations.

You can probably think of a bunch more questions that deal specifically with 
your business or industry, but I think you get the idea. To answer your ques-
tions, you need a piece of software that can keep track of the data you use to 
make your comparisons.
The GIS (by design) keeps track of point features, their X and Y coordinates, 
and their attribute information. It also stores the coordinate and attribute 
information for all the polygons in the locations covered by your database. 
When you put data into your GIS database, you usually put point and polygon 
features on separate layers (although you don’t absolutely have to). So, to 

242
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
compare these different features, you retrieve the point features (by type or 
value; see Chapter 11) from one layer and compare the result to polygons — 
also selectively retrieved by type or value — from another layer.
This process is called point-in-polygon overlay, and you follow these general 
steps to accomplish it in your GIS:
 
1. Use your system’s built-in query capabilities to find point features by 
any attribute you decide.
 
 The retrieved points are your first layer in this instance.
 
2. Use your system’s built-in query capabilities to find the polygon fea-
tures that you want to compare with the point features.
 
 The retrieved polygons are your second layer in this instance.
 
3. Place the point and polygon layers on top of each to create a 
new map.
 
 Your GIS creates a new visual display that shows both the points and 
the polygons. It also creates a table that combines the attribute informa-
tion from each layer.
 
 Creating a new map from your separate layers is important when you 
want to actually use that map for analysis. Unlike a strictly visual over-
lay that you might see in a graphics program or many CAD systems, GIS 
software relates not only the locations you see (the X and Y coordinates), 
but also the attribute information for every feature you’re comparing.
You use the tables that you get when you perform point-in-polygon overlays 
to analyze the results. These tables indicate which points occur in which 
polygons (as shown in Figure 16-1). Using this information, you can count the 
number of features for each polygon, calculate density by polygon, and per-
form a host of other analyses.
My discussion of point-in-polygons overlay is based on the vector data 
model, but you can easily do the same thing by using a raster GIS. When 
using a raster GIS, the software searches the attributes in the same way that 
it does in vector and compares the coordinates — but the exact X and Y 
coordinates are replaced by the grid cell’s position in the matrix.
 
The point-in-polygon operation is a powerful tool for comparing point objects 
to area objects, but you might not need to perform this operation if the points 
and polygons are already on the same map.

Finding lines on polygons
The movie title A River Runs through It pretty accurately explains the idea 
of line-on-polygon overlay methods. I changed the word in (from the point-
in-polygon method I describe in the preceding section) to on in this case 
because the vast majority of lines don’t fit completely inside any given poly-
gon. Instead, like a river, they cross polygon boundaries. (Perhaps using line-
through-polygon would be more appropriate, but few people use that term in 
the GIS industry.)
GIS
 Lines running through polygons may be just as meaningful for analysis as 
points in polygons. In many applications, such as transportation planning, the 
line features are the primary focus of the analysis. Transportation planning, 
for example, includes many types of lines whose presence can have profound 
impacts on the surrounding polygon features. Table 16-2 shows some exam-
ples of line-on-polygon comparisons.

In vector GIS, lines are composed of line segments, each with its own set of 
beginning and ending coordinate pairs. Most of the time, these beginning and 
ending locations don’t coincide exactly with the borders of polygons. So, the 
software has to work a little harder to figure out exactly where the line moves 
from one polygon to another by determining where the line is going and 
where it will intersect the coordinates of the boundary for each new polygon 
(as shown in Figure 16-2). Both raster and vector GIS models can perform 
line-on-polygon operations, but GIS users more commonly use the vector 
model for this operation.
Like with point-in-polygon methods (discussed in the preceding section), 
this overlay operation produces tables that show which lines and polygons 
intersect so that you can analyze properties like orientation, density, and 
comparisons of line and polygon types.

Using Logical Overlay 
to Compare Polygons
The most powerful, most robust, and probably most common types of over-
lay operations are those comparing one set of polygons to another. Generally 
known as polygon overlay, they offer many more options than point-in-poly-
gon and line-on-polygon overlays.
Logical overlay is a method of comparing multiple maps that uses a group of 
operations based on set theory to search the polygons to determine whether 
attributes are shared from one map to the other (belong to a common set).
In set theory, three basic set operations compare the objects contained in 
one set to those of another set. These operations are union (where you com-
bine all the stuff from both sets), intersection (where you select only those 
things common to both sets), and complement or symmetrical difference 
(where you identify all the objects that the sets don’t have in common).
 
Table 16-3 shows some possible uses of polygon overlay.

Unlike comparing sets of dinnerware or sets of keys to make decisions, with 
GIS software, you look at portions of each polygon that you overlay to see 
how those portions relate to other polygons in different layers. Like set 
theory itself, these overlays employ three basic types of operation. You’ll 
also find some less familiar but quite useful forms in your map comparison 
activities. I explain each of these forms in the following sections so that you 
can actually see what they look like.
Searching with union overlay
The first form of logical overlay is called union overlay (see Figure 16-3). 
Union overlay, sometimes called an OR search, collects all the polygons that 
have any of the attribute search criteria and makes a new map out of them. 
GIS

246
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
So, you might search for all polygons that are classed as agriculture in a land-
use map and polygons classed as flat lands in your terrain map. This search 
returns all lands that are both agriculture and flat. The resulting map would 
combine these two categories into a larger one. Union overlay maintains the 
categories from each of the input layers, so you can use them later to per-
form still more comparisons of flat agricultural land with other layers such as 
soil nutrient values.
 
Figure 16-3: 
Union 
overlay.
 
Output
Input
 
Use union overlay when you want to broaden your search and combine differ-
ent attributes of your polygons. All the polygons that have any of the search 
criteria are included in the output.
Using intersection overlay
Sometimes, you want to know which polygon features are shared by each of 
the polygons you’re searching. In other words, instead of combining pieces 
of land for sale with lands that are agricultural, you only want to know which 
agricultural lands you can buy. You can get this information by using a logical 
AND search, which needs both categories to exist before it returns a value to 
the output map. This search typically reduces the size of the area retrieved, 
instead of increasing it like union overlay does (see Figure 16-4).
 
Use intersection overlay when you want to narrow your search to satisfy a 
number of criteria at the same time. This technique can help you find the most 
appropriate places for some activity.

Understanding complement or 
symmetrical difference overlay
Sometimes, when you try to perform a search, you may find it easier to elimi-
nate things that don’t match all your criteria, instead of identifying those that 
do match. This search, called complement or symmetrical difference overlay, 
computes the geometric intersections of all polygon types and categories 
that don’t have certain attributes in common (see Figure 16-5). You might 
want to do this kind of search if you plan to later perform an analysis that 
relaxes the criteria you originally established.

248
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
 
Use complement overlay when you want to know what attributes a group of 
polygons doesn’t share.
Using identity overlay
Identity overlay is similar to intersection overlay, but it treats the layers dif-
ferently. One layer, the identity layer, must be composed of polygons because 
its attributes determine the identity of everything that coincides with it. But 
for the other input layer, you can use a point layer (such as wells) or a line 
layer (such as roads) if you want. When your GIS overlays the two layers, the 
new shape takes on the attributes of the identity layer (as shown in Figure 
16-6). In other words, it takes on the identity of that layer. So, you can have 
complete control over which layer is more important than another, which is 
a form of cartographic overlay hierarchy (where one layer takes precedence 
over another for analysis).
 
Figure 16-6: 
Identity

Input

Use identity overlay when you want to convert intersecting portions of one 
layer to the attributes of a more important layer. The more important layer is 
the layer that often controls what values will be assigned to the new polygons, 
and you usually determine which layer is more important based on what you 
want to change and what you want to stay the same after overlay.

249
 Chapter 16: Comparing Multiple Maps
Comparing geometry with clip overlay
You can use clip overlay to compare the geometries of different areas. You 
simply clip one portion of a map based on the size and configuration of 
another (see Figure 16-7). Think of clip overlay a bit like a cookie cutter. You 
might use this overlay if you want to combine information from a small sub-
portion of your study area with the entire study area. For example, if you’ve 
done some extensive field research on a small part of a larger forest and want 
to compare these new data to the original whole-forest layer. Obviously, you 
need only the small sample area to do your analysis. You don’t want the com-
puter to do all that time-consuming graphics work for parts of the database 
that you don’t need.
When you use clip overlay, the attributes of the polygon you clip aren’t a 
factor in determining the size and shape of the resulting layer. Instead, you 
gather all the information from all layers that you want — but for only a small 
portion of the map.
 
Figure 16-7: 
Clip overlay.
 
Input
Clip feature
Output
I found the clip overlay useful when I was working with a group of research-
ers studying land-use change during four different time periods. Because we 
used un-rectified aerial photographs, each of our study areas was slightly dif-
ferent from the others. To fix this discrepancy, we chose the study area that 
had the smallest footprint (covered the smallest area) as a cookie cutter and 
clipped all the other layers to match it.
 
Use the clip overlay when you want two or more layers to have the same 
geometry (size and shape), which allows you to have all the attributes that you 
want to evaluate, but for a selected portion of the study area.

250
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Understanding Raster Overlay
You can perform pretty much any overlay operation in either raster or vector 
GIS. In Chapter 17, I discuss map algebra. Map algebra is primarily a raster 
GIS modeling language that allows a huge amount of flexibility in comparing 
one map to another. Raster overlay is not only more powerful than its vector 
equivalent, but also less troublesome.
Among the more powerful features of raster overlay is that it can compare 
raster grid layers by mathematical expression, geometry, and statistical mea-
sures; and it’s capable of performing a wide variety of operations, including 
controlling both the search geometry of the overlay and the computational, 
logical, and statistical methods by which the GIS compares the numbers.
In raster, each grid cell has its own identity. Also, each grid cell’s location 
is directly aligned to the corresponding grid cells on the other layers (co-
registered). So, you don’t have to worry about all your layers being aligned 
or problems caused by mismatched edges. Raster overlay also eliminates 
the need to spend time evaluating very small (sliver) polygons to determine 
whether your GIS created them in error or they really are important.
 
Use raster overlay when you want to have some serious control over which 
portions of your map you overlay and what methods you employ.
Comparing Features with 
Selective Overlay
Selective overlay is not really a specific type or set of overlay operations — 
it’s a unique powerful portion of map algebra normally performed in raster 
GIS. In many situations, you know exactly which features you want to com-
pare to which others. Frequently, you even want to assign specific new cat-
egories and/or numbers to such combinations.
I worked with a team in which we used this technique to examine vegetation 
at different time periods and compare that vegetation to the landforms. We 
found over ten types of vegetation and ten types of landforms, making the 
number of possible combinations rather daunting. But daunting or not, we 
could more easily decide which combinations we really wanted to examine 
and do this overlay operation at the same time, rather than do each set as 
a separate set of overlays. Both approaches would work, but the selective 
overlay gave us the opportunity to get what we needed in a single operation. 
It also allowed us to experiment with different sets of combinations quickly.

251
 Chapter 16: Comparing Multiple Maps
Suppose that you want to do an overlay of a land-use map from 1974 and 
another from 2004 that contains soil capability class polygons. You want to 
decide whether the land uses in 1974 were appropriate by looking at whether 
those uses persisted through 30 years and worked with the soil capability 
classes. You can perform a series of individual overlay operations, or you 
can run the comparison based on a set of rules that you establish. This table 
includes a few hypothetical examples of combinations that you might want to 
make with your current scenario.

f you started reading this book here, you’re anxious to get started making 
the GIS work for you. Although retrieving maps and doing all the indi-
vidual analyses are often enough for everyday tasks, every now and then, you 
want to watch the GIS spread its wings and do something really spectacular. 
This chapter explains how you can let your GIS really soar.
GIS
 The original ideas and concepts underpinning this chapter are the brainchil-
dren of Dr. C. Dana Tomlin and his PhD advisor, Dr. Joseph K. Berry, then 
at the Yale School of Forestry. Their work has had a lasting and substantial 
impact on how you can use GIS to make models with maps.
In this chapter, I use the raster model to demonstrate how cartographic 
modeling works. I also show you the basics of the cartographic modeling lan-
guage called map algebra, the functions that the language provides, and how 
map algebra creates powerful models. Finally, I show you how you can test 
the output from map analysis for accuracy and acceptability.
Creating Cartographic Models
When C. Dana Tomlin developed his original Map Analysis Package (MAP) for 
his dissertation, he wasn’t thinking about data structures; he was thinking 
about modeling. He wanted a tool that would allow him to analyze and com-
bine many maps to produce cartographic models through a process he called 
(what else) cartographic modeling.

254
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Cartographic modeling is an ordered set of map operations designed to simu-
late some spatial decision-making (making decisions about geographic space) 
process. The order or sequence of map operations (including creating, 
combining, and analyzing) is often critical to the success of a cartographic 
model, and the idea that the result will simulate a spatial decision process is 
at the heart of a cartographic model. Each map operation follows a carefully 
thought-out path to model formulation that
 
✓ Identifies each and every output of the individual map operations
 
✓ Outlines each step in how the software derives the output
 
✓ Determines which map layers serve as the information sources with 
which the software builds the model
GIS
 People use GIS (cartographic) models only as a spatial decision-making sup-
port system. This single application seems to limit the utility of cartographic 
models, so I like to give the whole idea of decision-making a broader definition. 
By decision-making process, I mean any process that simulates physical or 
human environments and supports a wide host of possible activities, including
 
✓ Immediate action: Activities such as planning, where you decide to 
immediately employ cartographic modeling for practical resolution of 
real-world problems.
 
✓ Theoretical studies: Constructing cartographic models that simulate 
natural or human activities in geographic space, contributing to the 
body of knowledge by describing how spatial distributions of geographic 
features relate to other patterns or processes.
 
✓ Future planning: Information needed for decision-making support can 
be exploratory (for example, predicting traffic increases at selected loca-
tions over the next ten years) and can often lead to eventual decisions 
and related actions.
You can accomplish cartographic modeling with either a vector or a raster GIS. 
The operations used in cartographic modeling — map data analysis, and map 
comparison and combination — don’t need a raster data model to work. Even 
so, the cartographic model is at its most robust in the raster environment.
Understanding Map Algebra
Every modeling toolkit, whether spatial or aspatial (doesn’t lend itself to 
mapping), has a set of individual tools. The carpenter has hammers, saws, 
nails, and many other tools. The computer programmer has a set of expres-
sions, constants, and syntax rules for each programming language. Every set 
of tools has a set of procedures that controls how the tools are used effec-
tively. After all, you might be able to pound a nail in with a pipe wrench, but 
you probably get better results if you use a hammer.

255
 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
The GIS modeling toolkit is quite robust and demands an equally robust set 
of guidelines for its proper use. Fortunately, Dana Tomlin and his mentor Joe 
Berry created a set of rules — a modeling language, actually — that continues 
to provide a powerful structure for cartographic modeling. This language, 
called map algebra, is loosely based on matrix algebra — but map algebra is 
both simpler and more structured.
The upper-left corner of Figure 17-1 shows what mathematicians call a matrix 
of numbers. To add this 2-x-2 matrix to another matrix, you add the upper-left 
number from each matrix, the upper-right number from each, and the lower-
left and lower-right of each. You get an answer in the form of another matrix 
(at the upper-right of Figure 17-1).

You can do addition and subtraction pretty easily by using matrix math. You 
compare the locations of the cells one by one. When you need to use more 
advanced techniques, such as multiplication and division, for matrix algebra, 
the numbers aren’t compared upper right to upper right, lower right to lower 
right, and so on. When you work with GIS, this lack of consistency doesn’t 
help you calculate map values because the locations on the Earth are fixed 
to their locations. Map algebra simplifies matrix algebra so that the X and Y 
locations don’t move when you compare the numbers. Figure 17-2 shows how 
matrix algebra and map algebra differ when it comes to multiplication.

Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Tomlin and Berry saw the usefulness of being able to compare grid cell num-
bers by using all the power of mathematics. When they created the map alge-
bra language, they recognized that the X and Y locations weren’t just matrix 
positions, but positions on the Earth’s surface. Each grid cell location for 
each layer must correspond exactly with its counterpart in all other layers.
The GIS software must also maintain this correspondence between the loca-
tions of grid cell values on multiple layers during analysis — each grid cell on 
one map must be in the same column and row for its corresponding grid cell 
on another map. Likewise, each operation will need to follow this rule so that 
the correct grid cells are compared during analysis. Any serious cartographic 
modeler is very familiar with this modeling language both because it is so 
powerful and because it has become the industry standard.
The Language of Map Algebra
Map algebra was developed when GIS software typically used the command-
line interface, where you actually typed words to get the software to perform 
its tasks rather than click icons and pull-down menus. Although today’s 
GIS typically employs a graphical user interface, map algebra functionality 
is still tied to the idea of written commands. Map algebra commands have 
an English-like language structure, with an action verb (what you do to the 
map), direct objects (the maps that you retrieve), and a prepositional phrase 
(describing what you create as a result of the action).
A simple, but typical command might read like this:
Add (action verb) mymap (the object input map) to yourmap (another 
object input map) for ourmap (the output map)
When executed, this command uses the power of the map algebra mathemat-
ics structure. Each grid cell in each location for mymap is added to each grid 
cell in each location for yourmap to create an output map with the sum of 
each of these individual operations found in each corresponding cell location 
in ourmap. This simplified example gives you the basic idea of how map alge-
bra works.
Performing Functions with Map Algebra
You can use map algebra to perform a wide variety of operations that com-
prise the cartographic modeling process. These operations include issuing 
commands themselves, determining when and how often commands are 
issued, determining the nature of the output, and actually performing the 

257
 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
mathematics of the map analyses. Although these map algebra commands 
used to be part of a command-line system, they exist as part of the graphical 
user interface of the modern GIS. And so, you work through the graphical 
interface to apply the map algebra and make your cartographic models.
Exercising control
Most of the control you have over cartographic modeling comes from the 
user interface. A good example of this user interface is the ESRI ArcGIS 
Spatial Analyst Raster Calculator. This tool allows you to add many types of 
input to the modeling process, including raster datasets, shapefiles, cover-
ages, tables, constants, and even individual numbers.
This variety gives the software incredible power to shape the model before 
the software has even done any analysis. The Calculator searches all the 
data included in the active database and shows the available input data in its 
search window. You can then query the available data by using the graphical 
user interface, which you can use much more easily than command-line que-
ries to find what you need.
Besides providing numerous options for input, the Raster Calculator pro-
vides a complete set of operators for arithmetic, trigonometric, and logical 
comparison activities (like most other raster user interfaces do). You can use 
these operators — which give you access to an extensive set of mathematical 
manipulations — to create composite groups of modeling tasks called functions.
 
Essentially, an interface such as the Raster Calculator (shown in Figure 17-3) 
provides a means to write out complete and often very sophisticated map 
algebra expressions based on built-in mathematical capabilities. Just a few of 
these built-in capabilities include addition, subtraction, multiplication, divi-
sion, roots, powers, absolute values, trigonometric functions, geometric func-
tions, greater or less than, remainders, assignments, and formal logic.
Map algebra expressions that give you control over your model building 
include
 
✓ Queries: Find and input data.
 
✓ Functions: You choose functions based on how you want to compare 
and analyze the data.
 
✓ Operators: Direct the mathematical manipulation and logical compari-
sons to drive the functions.
The power and flexibility of the GIS comes in many different forms in which 
you can put functions together to take advantage of all the mathematics that 
the grid cells can use.

258

Calculator

Using local functions
The most basic function type is called the local function because it operates 
on each cell individually. Sometimes called by-cell operations, these func-
tions are among the simplest — and most often used — of the map algebra 
functions. Tomlin used to refer to these functions as a worm’s eye view of the 
grid cells because his theoretical worm could see only a single grid cell at a 
time and so couldn’t react with other neighboring cells. You can manipulate 
each grid cell by using virtually any of the operators, and then compare and 
combine each grid cell with the corresponding grid cells in other layers.
The local functions are usually grouped into six sets of operators:
 
✓ Trigonometric: Such as sine and cosine
 
✓ Exponential and logarithmic: Such as squares, cubes, and log base 10
 
✓ Reclassification: Such as invert, double, and change all to 1
 
✓ Selection: Such as select all > 2, all between 3 and 10, and so on
 
✓ Statistical: Such as mean, median, and mode
 
✓ Other: Mostly mathematical, such as add, subtract, and conditional 
comparison
Figure 17-4 shows the input grid and resulting output grid after the software 
applies a trigonometric sine function, and Figure 17-5 shows a statistical 
example.

If you understand the basic concept of map algebra, you understand pretty 
much every local function that you can imagine. Local functions are also 
easier to explain than those that don’t operate on a cell-by-cell basis (such 
as focal, zonal, and others). You may find the simplicity of these functions 
handy if you need to explain your GIS modeling to a user.
Using focal functions
Unlike local functions (discussed in the preceding section) — where you 
zoom in to gain the worm’s eye view — focal functions allow you to pull back 
a bit and begin to see the area around you. This area is sometimes called 
a neighborhood. Focal functions evaluate a single grid cell based on some 
characteristic of its surrounding cells, or neighborhood. (Focal functions 
are sometimes called neighborhood functions.) In general, the focal function 
allows you to look at a target cell (the cell that you’re characterizing or work-
ing on), evaluate it based on some relationship it shares with its neighbor-
hood, and return new grid cell value in the same X and Y coordinates but on 
a new output layer (as shown in Figure 17-6).

Focal neighborhoods are based on a search radius and a shape for the 
search, often called the geometry. Initially, focal functions assume that most 
neighborhoods include grid cells that border or touch the target grid cell. 
The neighborhood can, and usually does, extend beyond these bordering 
cells and can ignore some bordering cells based on the search geometry.

Defining your neighborhood’s size and shape
To create a simple search pattern, search for the eight neighboring cells 
around your target cell in a 3-x-3 matrix. That configuration is called an annu-
lus (donut shape) with a search radius of one cell (as shown in Figure 17-7). 
An annulus could search two cells away from the target, three cells, or more.

Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
You can also evaluate neighborhoods that include rectangles of all nine cells 
(including the target cell), wedges (pie shapes) in different directions, and 
circles (including the target cell). In short, you can choose from a few differ-
ent geometries to define your neighborhood search area.
 
You select the geometry of your neighborhood for focal functions based 
on how far away from the target cell you need to go to evaluate grid cells. 
The distance is often a function of how the real environment you are model-
ing works (for example, how far from a gas leak you might encounter a fire 
hazard).
Focusing on focal flow
One focal function is called the focal flow func-
tion and is really part of the modeling toolkit 
used for analyzing basins and hydrological 
conditions (covered in Chapter 14). Focal flow 
evaluates the neighborhood cells but operates 
on only the adjacent eight cells — sometimes 
called the immediate neighborhood. Because 
of this limitation, you don’t have to tell the soft-
ware the search radius or the shape.
In most focal operations, the software returns 
a value to the focal cell (the target of the cal-
culations). This focal flow operation is sort of 
backwards because it’s really comparing the 
focal cell to the neighborhood, rather than com-
paring the neighborhood to the focal cell. You 
use a focal flow function to determine, given the 
height of the target cell, which of the outside 
cells would allow water to drain (flow) into the 
target (focal cell).
The GIS compares each height of the neighbor-
ing grid cells to the height of the target (center) 
grid cell. If the neighbor cell is higher, it drains 
into the target cell. The software puts a 1 into 
that cell. If the neighbor cell is lower than the 
target cell, the software assigns that cell a 0. If 
the neighboring-cell and target-cell values are 
the same, the software uses one of a variety of 
different ways to indicate no flow. So, this focal 
function adds complexity and produces eight 
values, rather than one, because the software 
returns values to the neighborhood locations, 
not to the focal-cell location (as shown in the 
figure).

 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
You might be scratching your head, wondering how you might need all these 
different shapes for neighborhoods. Most people will never use all, or even 
most, of these shapes. Here are a few points about size and shape of impact 
areas to help you decide on your neighborhood geometries:
 
✓ The size of your neighborhood area is based on the area of impact of 
the attributes you’re looking for. Sounds impressive, no? If you know, 
for example, that people can hear construction noise for ten miles from 
its point of origin, you can define your neighborhood as a circle with a 
radius of ten miles.
 
✓ Circular shapes are common GIS search patterns. The circle is the 
most compact two-dimensional shape, and is easy to reproduce. The 
types of features that occur as circles and can take advantage of this cir-
cular search methodology are:
 
• Center-pivot irrigation circles
 
• Circular animal mounds and ant nests
 
• Exposed rock domes and salt domes
 
• Some archaeological sites and Indian mounds
 
• Coppice dunes
 
• Crop circles . . . okay, that’s a bit of a stretch — but crop circles 
exist, no matter who (or what!) creates them
 
✓ You can search neighborhoods with rectangles because many human 
features occur in that shape. You’ve probably seen many housing subdi-
visions divided up into square blocks. You could certainly make a block 
of a certain size into a neighborhood.
 
✓ Other shapes can simulate real-world shapes during search. Some 
shapes are more obscure than circles or rectangles, but some types of 
features, both natural and man-made, have these kinds of geometries:
 
• A ring of vegetation around the base of hills, or around ponds and 
small lakes, forms an annulus.
 
• Wedges might describe alluvial fans and river deltas, and even the 
pie-shaped crop types within a single center-pivot irrigation feature.
You can no doubt come up with other characteristics that define your neigh-
borhoods. Each feature that you include in your search provides a reason for 
you to select the size and shape of your neighborhood. The exact syntax for 
how you make this selection varies with your GIS software, but essentially, 
you define the shape and the search size as part of your search strategy.
Comparing your neighborhood to the target cell
After you know the size and shape of your neighborhood (as I talk about in 
the preceding section), you need to decide what properties you want to use 

264
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
to compare your neighborhood cells to the target cell. You can use pretty 
much all the operators you have available in the local functions for focal 
functions, as well.
Figure 17-8 shows two simple 3-x-3 annulus examples, one that uses the 
majority and another that uses the maximum. The first search is a focal 
majority that returns the number that occurs most often in the annulus to 
(the eight-cell ring around) the target cell. The focal-maximum search returns 
the highest number that occurs in the eight-cell ring.
Exploring zonal functions
Unlike focal functions (discussed in the preceding section), zonal functions 
don’t create neighborhoods. They use zones, either from a single grid or 
from other layers to compare cells by either attribute (description) or shape 
(geometry). You need to define the zone with which you want to work. A 
zone is equivalent to what geographers call formal regions. Regions are areas 
or groups of areas that share common descriptive information. In a raster 
data model, a region (or zone) is a group of grid cells that have the same 
attributes.
 
Formal geographic regions can be contiguous (all in one chunk), perforated 
(with holes that have different attributes), or fragmented (like islands that 
share attributes).
Comparing zonal values
Like with local functions, you can apply a large array of quantitative and logi-
cal operators to zonal functions. The most common such operators include 
majority, minimum, maximum, mean, median, minority, range, standard devi-
ation, sum, and variety.
The general approach to zonal functions follows these basic steps:
 
1. Create one input layer, called the zone layer (Ingrid 1 in Figure 17-9), 
as the top layer for comparison.
 
 The zone layer defines the zone or zones that you want to evaluate.
 
2. Create another input layer that has the values you want to use to eval-
uate for each zone (Ingrid 2 in Figure 17-9).
 
3. Perform the comparison functions for each zone.
 
 For example, you may want to find the variety for each different zone (as 
shown in Figure 17-10). Finding the variety tells you which zones (Ingrid 
1) have the greatest number of different types of features based on the 

265
 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
grid categories contained in each zone. Ecologists might use this type of 
function when they want to identify areas of high biodiversity (variety of 
habitat, for example).

Classifying zones based on zonal geometry
Zonal functions augment their analytical techniques by allowing you to clas-
sify based on the geometry of the zones themselves. This technique works 
well for finding individual polygons or groups of polygons of a particular 
size, as shown in Chapter 10. The most common approaches to classifica-
tion based on zonal geometry include zonal area, zonal perimeter, and zonal 
thickness. You may find zonal thickness really useful if you’re looking for long 
and skinny features, for example.
Figure 17-11 shows an example of the zonal area approach, where the software 
finds and selects zones base on adding up the areas of all the grid cells in each 
zone. The software then returns the area value to every cell in the zone.

In raster GIS, area is calculated by adding up the sizes of all the grid cells 
included in the zone. Details of calculating sizes of geographic features are 
outlined in Chapter 12:
 
✓ Area: The number of grid cells multiplied by the area of the ground that 
each cell represents.
 
✓ Perimeter: The sum of the widths of the outermost grid cells if they’re 
orthogonal (edge to edge) and the sum of the diagonals for each cell if 
they’re diagonal.
The zonal function can find the centroid (center of an area) for determining 
the orientation of a polygon (as discussed in Chapter 13). Identifying the cen-
troid allows you to compare the centroid of one fragment or zone to another, 
which you can use to measure isolation (which I discuss in Chapter 12).
 
In raster, polygon means a collection of grid cells of the same value or attribute.

Understanding block functions
Sometimes, you need to resample a set of grid cells to a coarser group of 
grids (bigger grid cells) so that the set matches other raster layers. For 
example, if a grid has 20-meter grid cells representing 1951 land use, and you 
want to compare that to Landsat Multi-Spectral Sensor (MSS) data represent-
ing 1975 land use in 80-meter pixels (think of these as grid cells derived from 
satellites), you can generalize the 1951 grid cells so that they match the 1975 
pixels. You need to group blocks of grid cells and reclassify them so that they 
match the 80-meter pixels by using the block function.
The block function takes a uniform, non-overlapping block of grid cell values 
and changes them based on any of the following operators: mean, majority, 
maximum, minimum, median, minority, range, standard deviation, sum, and 
variety — the same operators that are available for zonal functions.
The following steps demonstrate how the block function works:
 
1. Define how big you want the neighborhood (the block) to be.
 
 In the example (shown in Figure 17-12), I define a 3-x-3 block, but your 
blocks can be any size you want, as long as they stay the same through-
out the whole grid.
 
2. Define the operator that you want to apply to the block.
 
 In this example, I’m using a block maximum operation. So, for each non-
overlapping 3-x-3 block, the software looks over all the numbers and 
searches for the largest number in the block.

269
 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
 
3. Create an output grid and assign the values resulting from the opera-
tion to each cell in the block.
 
 Now, the difference between focal and block functions becomes really 
clear. In focal functions (which you can read about in the section 
“Using focal functions,” earlier in this chapter), the software takes that 
maximum number and assigns it to a single focal cell in the output. In 
contrast, the block function assigns the maximum number to the entire 
block: All nine grid cells in each block get the maximum value.

Using global functions
Global functions are the exact opposite of local functions (as discussed in the 
section “Using local functions,” earlier in this chapter). Instead of seeing the 
database from a local function’s worm’s eye view, a global function takes the 
bird’s-eye view — it can see and operate on the entire study area at the same 
time. Global functions are very powerful and complex operations. Here are 
some examples:
 
✓ Distance measures: Such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance
 
✓ Surface functions: Such as finding basins, pour points, and drainage 
networks
 
✓ Interpolation functions: Such as linear, nonlinear, trend surface, and exact
 
✓ Hydrology functions: Such as water accumulation and flow direction

270
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
You can also use two other groups of global functions — the groundwater 
global functions and the multivariate global functions.
The really geeky groundwater global function
The groundwater global functions are some of the most complex functions 
available in the standard GIS software package. They’re almost universally 
raster based and allow you to not only model the flow of liquids in different 
substrates (permeable material that fluids flow through), but also in different 
thicknesses of substrate (for example, underground aquifers), and with dif-
ferent amounts of head gradient (the amount of pressure based on the slope 
through which the underground water moves). These functions also allow 
you to analyze the movement of dissolved solids within these systems, which 
you might use to model point (occurring at a single source) and non-point 
source (occurring over an area) pollution.
Many hydrological engineering programs and specialized GIS software pack-
ages deal explicitly with subsurface flows and groundwater movement. Many 
general GIS packages are now incorporating some of these sophisticated 
operations to satisfy an increasing customer base. I don’t want to bog you . . . 
or me . . . down in the gory detail of these models. If you’re a hydrologist, you 
can find documentation about these functions.
The radical fringe global functions
The multivariate functions of the GIS aren’t technically GIS functions at all — 
they’re a collection and implementation of traditional statistical functions, 
including some very sophisticated techniques familiar mostly to statisticians. 
I don’t go into detail about these functions, but you should know that most 
professional GIS packages have some of these functions built-in.
Formulating a Model
Whether you use map algebra or any other approach to GIS analysis, you 
probably use more than one map and more than one analytical technique 
to answer your questions. These combinations of maps and techniques are 
generally part of a complex set of ordered operations (operations done in a 
logical sequence) that GIS people call a model.
 
Some call this ordered operation and its output just a model, some a spatial 
model, some a GIS model, but the term most commonly applied by analysts is 
a cartographic model. It’s called a cartographic model partly because C. Dana 
Tomlin and Joe Berry coined that name years ago, but also because it just 
makes sense. You’re making models that result in maps. Mapmaking is cartog-
raphy. So, you become, in essence, your own cartographer who makes and 
combines maps to answer questions. Hence, a cartographic model.

271
 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
GIS
 
I’ve talked to literally hundreds of people who specialize in cartographic mod-
eling. Nearly everyone has told me that the key to good cartographic modeling 
is to formulate the model through the use of flowcharting techniques. They 
also tell me that you should normally create the flowcharts even before you 
know what’s in your database. Such formulations have helped me decide what 
should go into the model in the first place.
Making a formulation flowchart
The easiest way to formulate a model is by creating a formulation flowchart — 
a set of graphics and arrows showing steps in the modeling process. A formu-
lation flowchart starts with the final desired product (the spatial information 
product), breaks it up into sub-models, and finally outlines the actual map 
elements that you need. Your software may have built-in flowcharting capa-
bilities, you may have your own flowcharting software, or you can even (hold 
onto your hat here) use a pencil and paper. (Sometimes, this old pencil-and-
paper way is the fastest.)
Suppose that you want to put up some solar panels to generate electric-
ity. You call the map that you want to create solsites, meaning sites where 
you should place solar panels. You need to make sure that you fulfill three 
requirements of your solar-panel placement:
 
✓ Each site must be at least 2 miles from town.
 
✓ Each site should be on slopes of at least 30 degrees but less than 55 
degrees.
 
✓ The slopes must face south to get as much sun as possible.
Figure 17-13 shows your formulation flowchart.

Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Expanding your sphere of influence
Allocation, which also works with networks (as 
I talk about in Chapter 15), involves finding all 
the areas within your sphere of influence, or 
your territory. Say that you and your brother 
decide that you want to put up small grocery 
stores at opposite ends of your town. You want 
to know which part of the town will visit your 
store and which part will visit your brother’s 
store. In other words, you want to allocate part 
of the town, and your brother wants to allocate 
the rest.
You can allocate portions of space to individual 
facilities in vector systems by using Thiessen 
polygons, but you have a nice easy-to-under-
stand way of doing it by using raster systems. 
First, identify the two targets (your grocery 
stores). The software starts moving out from 
each of those places to decide which grid cells 
it allocates to your store and which it allocates 
to your brother’s store. Say that your store has a 
value of 2, and your brother’s store has a value 
of 1 (see the figure). Depending on your soft-
ware, it might start its search from your store or 
from your brother’s, but generally, the algorithm 
that the software uses alternates between the 
two of them.

When the software knows the locations of the 
target cells, it measures distance outward from 
those locations: 1 for each orthogonal cell and 
1.414 for each diagonal cell. It examines each 
grid cell in the entire database. When it selects 
each cell away from the target, it compares 
its distance from each target-cell location. If 
a grid cell is closer to your store, the software 
assigns it the same value as your store (2), but 
if the cell is closer to your brother’s store, the 
software assigns it a value of 1 to correspond to 
his store. Software differs in how it deals with 
ties, but most software assigns values based 
on the order in which it finds the cells. Consult 
your software documentation to figure out how 
it assigns ties.

273
 Chapter 17: Map Algebra and Model Building
In Figure 17-13, notice how the final spatial information product on the left 
(solsites) breaks down into submodels that identify searchable aspects of the 
GIS data:
 
✓ Good aspect and good slope: You can derive both of these submodels from 
manipulations and reclassifications of the same starting map element — 
topography (essentially, a Digital Elevation Model, or DEM). In this case, 
you want a south-facing aspect and a slope between 30 and 55 degrees.
 
✓ Good distance: To determine an area that fits the good distance sub-
model, you measure 2 miles from the outside perimeter of the City poly-
gon on a map layer containing city limits data.
You use the GIS software to combine the sub-models by using a map overlay 
operation (discussed in Chapter 16) called intersection, which means that it 
finds only those areas that include all the elements (2 miles from the city, slopes 
between 30 and 55 degrees, and a south aspect) for your solsites locations.
This basic model has all the elements that you need to make more complex 
models. You can break models into smaller pieces, and each of the pieces 
requires one or more map elements to produce it. And you can use the same 
map element to create multiple derived maps. Cool, huh?
Basing your database on your flowchart
When you finish a formulation flowchart, you know exactly what map ele-
ments you need to create the maps you want. Instead of relying on an exist-
ing database, you can make all the decisions about what maps, at what 
scales, and with what classifications you need to get your answer. You’re not 
even restricted by whether the maps exist. You’re creating a best-case sce-
nario, and the most effect and most accurate models start with this kind of 
model-specific data.
 
Always take the time to develop a formulation flowchart of your cartographic 
model that includes everything you want to see the model contain without 
worrying about whether the data are available.
Implementing a Model
Implementing a cartographic model is really just the reverse of formulating 
it, but with one major difference. You can no longer assume that you have 
all the best data and all the map elements that you need to do the job. If you 
assume that you have all the layers at the appropriate scales and classifica-
tion levels for your solsites model, you simply need to reverse the flowchart 
so that it moves from basic map element input to the final product (see 
Figure 17-14).

274
Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Some GIS software has built-in flowcharting programs that do more than 
provide you with a flowchart. They actually populate the portions of the 
flowchart with data and take that data through its paces. Programs such as 
the ESRI Model Builder allow you to run the model many times, changing and 
modifying its formulas and its contents until it performs in exactly the way you 
want. Such flowcharting programs provide both documentation for how you 
constructed the model, and an efficient and repeatable way to reproduce it.
No matter what software you use, or whether it contains a modeling tool, 
your cartographic models probably don’t have the exact data, with the pre-
cise level of scale, containing exactly the categories available to you. You can 
deal with inadequate or improper data in three ways:
 
✓ Find better data, if you can. Getting better data is always the best way 
to deal with inadequate data. In an ideal situation, you’d have the time 
to collect primary data specific to your needs. Time and resources may 
limit your ability to collect this kind of data, however. Consult with 
other GIS users in your area who may possess data that would work for 
you. If no one has any data that he’ll give you for free, you may have to 
purchase data from a commercial vendor.
 
✓ Adapt the model to fit available data. Although it’s not the best solu-
tion, you can modify your model to adapt to what data you do have. You 
may have to leave parts of the model incomplete, be more general in 
your conclusions, or modify how the model arrives at its conclusions.
 
✓ Employ surrogates. The final solution to data issues in cartographic 
modeling is to find data that you can substitute for the data that you 
really need. Such spatial surrogates (replacement data) might include 
housing in place of population, power lines for missing roads, and fire 
patterns to indicate wind direction and intensity.
 
 You often have to use spatial surrogates based on rather anecdotal 
evidence. If it’s available to you, try to use literature, expert opinion, 
or even experimental evidence to make the strongest possible linkage 
between surrogates and the data for which they substitute. You can do 
so by determining — and supporting with evidence — that one value is a 
reasonable approximation of the other.
 
Some of these techniques may require a leap of faith on your part, but remem-
ber, no kind of modeling is an exact science. So, I’m providing a disclaimer — 
I’m not responsible for the improper use of the output! You might want to 
include a complete explanation of the methods employed to create the output 
so that the user knows how reliable the model is.

Testing a Model
No model is perfect. In many cases, you can’t get any correct answers — only 
defensible and indefensible ones. An often-neglected part of cartographic 
modeling involves testing the output. A true test of modeling often requires a 
truth set (a known correct answer) against which you test the output.
 
Unfortunately, visiting a location that you modeled probably can’t yield 
answers about whether your model is correct. Imagine, for example, trying 
to test a model that predicts the population distribution of your city in 2020. 
Unless you have a time machine, you can’t figure out whether the model is a 
perfect predictor of the distribution.
Over the years, I’ve discovered four aspects of GIS modeling that you can 
examine without the need for a time machine. The following sections cover 
these points in detail:
 
✓ Is the software working correctly (giving you the correct numbers based 
on the algorithms)?
 
✓ Does the model produce answers that aren’t too limiting or too general?
 
✓ Is the outcome logical and consistent with the real world?
 
✓ Is the user satisfied with the product?
Determining whether the software 
is working correctly
When you need to figure out whether the software algorithms are working 
correctly, you can most easily perform an analysis on a very small part of the 
database and check it against a manual computation of the same area.

Part IV: Analyzing Geographic Patterns 
Assessing whether the model 
gives adequate results
You need to carefully consider whether the constraints that you put into 
your model give you adequate results. I’ve run models that attempt to show 
the most appropriate place to put a planned development only to have the 
model tell me that the majority of the unoccupied portion of the city will 
do nicely. If you get this kind of result, you need to rethink your model and 
tighten the rules and constraints. I also created a model to show the best 
location for winter movement of troops, and the output gave me a blank map 
because I made the constraints too tight. Adjusting model constraints takes 
finesse; consult the user when you make adjustments so that you don’t vio-
late the spirit or purpose of the model.
Gauging whether your model makes sense
Models must make sense. I can’t tell you how to determine whether a model 
makes sense because I’m probably not an expert in your particular field or 
discipline. Use your own background to assess whether the logic is consis-
tent with how your portion of the real world works. To make this determina-
tion, you (and often the user) need to be able to interpret the model. Making 
your cartographic model understandable, you may need to provide ample 
documentation, make sure that the model employs easy-to-understand func-
tions and operations, include flowcharts, and even keep the model simple 
and general enough that users can easily figure out its purpose and function.
Ensuring that your model satisfies the user
Most real-world GIS operations employ consulting firms to do their carto-
graphic modeling (although this fact is changing). The users must be satisfied 
with the model. They might find a really accurate model worthless because 
it doesn’t provide the answers that they want or expect, they can’t read or 
interpret the output (bad map design), the output is in the wrong format (for 
example, a travel log versus a map), or the GIS doesn’t deliver the model and 
output on time.
 
I don’t have any easy answers to potential problems of model-user dissatisfac-
tion, but I do have one suggestion: Make sure that you always keep the lines of 
communication open with the users. If you keep the users involved through-
out the process, they’re much more likely to accept the final product. A cor-
rect model is a useful model only if the user accepts it. Keep the user involved 
in every phase of your GIS work.

 GIS analysis is only as good as its ability to commu-
nicate the results to the user. In this part, I show 
you how you can use GIS to create traditional map output. 
Or you might opt for some radically different types of 
maps (called cartograms), which are sometimes even 
more effective at communicating your message.
But GIS output isn’t limited to maps; this part also intro-
duces other types of output, including travel directions, 
lists, tables, animations, and flythroughs — all of which 
help boost your understanding of how to present the 
results of your analyses. Finally, this part offers a guide 
for how you can efficiently incorporate the GIS technology 
into your organization and take advantage of its trans-
forming power.

In This Chapter
▶ Finding your way around a traditional map
▶ Understanding the usefulness of cartograms
I
n the past, trained cartographers in cartographic production shops made 
almost all the maps created. Their products were hard copy maps done 
on parchment, paper, Mylar, or other surfaces, depending on the technology 
of the day. Today, large production shops are still available in government 
agencies such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) or in 
businesses (such as Rand McNally) that specialize in maps. Many profes-
sional cartographers do both production and cartographic design work for 
GIS companies, as well.
These large shops will likely be around for some time. They can always find a 
market for large volumes of well-designed maps, ranging from the general ref-
erence and atlas maps to content-specific thematic maps. Although the shops 
have staying power, their role in producing cartographic output is quickly 
and permanently changing because of the ready availability and rapidly 
increasing numbers of GIS software users.
When you work with GIS software, you’re the cartographer. Unfortunately, 
you don’t automatically inherit the training and experience that professional 
cartographers possess because you own the latest and greatest GIS software. 
GIS software provides you access to the cartographer’s toolkit, but many of 
those tools have specialized uses that require instruction and particular con-
ditions under which you can and should use them.
The cartographic product of your GIS work is important. You can do the most 
elaborate and impressive GIS models in the world, but when you’re done, 
you need to produce a map that the user accepts and, more importantly, that 
exactly communicates the analysis.
This chapter shows some basic ideas behind how you can produce good 
maps. I show you some bad maps and describe how they detract from the 
quality of your GIS work. The more you work with GIS, the more maps you 

280
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
see. While you see more and more quality maps, you can begin to appreciate 
all the hard work that goes into them. More importantly, you start to see how 
the application of some basic principles can lead to effective map output.
Exploring Traditional Maps
Traditional maps are the most common forms of maps and generally the most 
easily understood by the general public. Reading and interpreting maps is 
much easier if the scales, symbology, classes, and graphic design elements are 
all focused on visual communication. (See Chapter 2 for more about how maps 
show information.) These principles hold true for computer displays, just like 
they do for maps put on silk, papyrus, or other non-computer surfaces.
 
Here are the five basic characteristics of good map design (the cardinal rules 
of mapping):
 
✓ Make sure that the map meets users’ needs. Always make this charac-
teristic rule number one. If the user can’t interpret the map or the map 
presents the wrong information, all your time and the results of your 
analysis are wasted.
 
✓ Make the map easy to use and understand. Avoid confusion at all costs.
 
✓ Accuracy is essential to good map design. As much as possible, avoid data 
errors, unintended data and graphic distortions, and misinterpretations.
 
✓ The method of map presentation should relate correctly to the data. 
Make sure that you use the right type of map — one with the right sym-
bols, correct classes, scales, projections, and so on.
 
✓ Allow the user to review and interact with the map during production. 
Make sure the user understands what the map is all about, that it meets 
his or her needs, and that it communicates the information correctly.
Mapping qualitative data
Sometimes, when you create a map, you map qualitative (descriptive or nomi-
nal) data, which generally requires that you pick unique symbols for each 
category.
Many software programs set their default so that when you open your map of 
a certain set of polygons, the map contains the borders for each polygon, but 
the polygons themselves are all the same color. You may find this layout con-
fusing the first time you see it, but don’t worry. All your information is there. 
The software defaults to this layout so that you can determine the colors and 
patterns you want to use for your map, as shown in Figure 18-1.

281
 Chapter 18: Producing Cartographic Output
 
Figure 18-1:

map (left) 
and a map

added 
colors

The GIS groups the categories by attribute value, such as land-use type or 
road type. Using a separate pattern for each category allows the reader to 
instantly pick out one from another. Two general types of attributes assign 
unique colors or patterns to category values:
 
✓ Attributes that describe the names, types, or qualitative condition of the 
features
 
✓ Attributes that identify specific objects, such as the names for countries, 
states, or colors
Most GIS software allows you to use a set of predesigned color or shading 
schemes, or to create and employ your own. When working in black and 
white (for publications that don’t use color, for example), you can use the 
shading patterns rather than colors.
Mapping quantitative data
Most of the output from GIS is based on numbers, statistics, and other quan-
titative data that describe something about the features you’re mapping.
 
Most non-cartographers don’t really know how to decide what specific data to 
map or how to display them. Here are three general rules to help out:
 
✓ If you want to see the raw data and relative comparisons, map the 
counts or amounts themselves. Be careful, however, because amounts 
might be misleading. Imagine looking at numbers of newspaper subscrib-
ers in New York City — millions of people — versus Bismarck, North 
Dakota, with less than 100,000 people. The results of such a map merely 
reflect total population rather than the number of newspaper readers 
per capita.

282
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
 
✓ If you want to control for area or number of features (called normal-
izing your data), use ratios. Ratios require you to compare two values. 
For example, you could compare the number of newspaper subscrip-
tions per 1,000 people living in the subscription area or population per 
square mile.
 
✓ If you want to compare the relative values from place to place or fea-
ture to feature, you want to map those values as ranks. You might rank 
newspaper subscription ratios per 1,000 people for each city. So, you 
replace the actual numbers with the ranks.
Buying an output device
Even though computers can display maps on-
screen, hardcopy still has its charms. People 
often print out digital text documents, even 
though they don’t have to, partly because 
people are usually more comfortable when they 
can actually touch a map because they’re usu-
ally more familiar with maps as documents.
GIS software and hardware can produce hard 
copy maps. You can find many devices that are 
designed just for these tasks. Some devices 
print only text, and others print graphics, as 
well. Keep these tips in mind when you’re ready 
to go from your GIS to hard copy output:
 ✓ Choose an output device that’s right for 
your needs. Large-format plotters and 
raster printers can produce large maps, but 
they require special paper, inks, and sup-
plies that affect your budget.
 ✓ Choose output devices based on volume. 
If you plan to make only a few production 
maps, you need only one set of devices, but 
if you plan to create a production facility, 
you need to consider much higher volume 
production equipment.
 ✓ Consider the ink. Most inks fade with time, 
but some are more prone to fading than 
others. Ask your vendor about the impact 
of light on the ink. Also, keep in mind that 
the colors of the ink are not the same as 
what you see on your monitor. Many GIS 
users are disappointed by the loss of color 
intensity, lack of contrast, or even the dif-
ferent appearance of the colors.
 ✓ Keep supplies handy. You never know 
when a big job will come down the road 
and you’ll need supplies. You need time to 
get your hands on some kinds of supplies. 
Find a good, reliable vendor. Make sure the 
vendor knows your needs and the demand 
you place on the equipment and supplies.
 ✓ Have a backup plan for output. Having sup-
plies such as toner drums, ink, pens, and 
paper doesn’t help if your printer stops 
working. Have additional output devices 
as backups or reach an agreement with 
another organization that can help you in a 
pinch.
 ✓ Check compatibility. Output devices have 
their own graphics languages. Make sure 
that your GIS software and your output 
device can talk to each other. You normally 
don’t have to worry about a problem if you 
use professional GIS software that either 
comes bundled with compatible hardware 
or is adaptable to changes in hardware.

283
 Chapter 18: Producing Cartographic Output
Creating classes
An important aspect of deciding what to map deals with whether you want to 
map each individual value, or group (classify) the values and then map those 
groups. If you have only a few items to map (normally, less than ten), you can 
display each one with a separate symbol or color. If you have more than ten 
items (which you usually do), you need to group those items. Otherwise, 
the reader can’t visually separate the many shades and colors needed to 
display them.
For example, if you tried to map each of the 3,000 or so counties of the conti-
nental United States with a unique color or pattern for each county, the map 
reader would have to try to distinguish between these 3,000 colors and pat-
terns. For the map to be readable, you’d have to create groups (classes) that 
reflect real differences in value and enable the readers to see the patterns 
you want them to see.
You can create classes in many ways and use each class in a variety of ways. 
You want to put data into classes that allow similar values to be in the same 
class — sort of like how teachers separate out student exams into letter 
grades. You need to make two decisions:
 
✓ How many classes you need
 
✓ How to divide the classes into appropriate groups
You typically find seven general ways to classify data available in GIS soft-
ware. Different software uses different names for these classifications, but 
here are general descriptions:
 
✓ Equal interval: Equally divides the range of values to be classified, for 
example, 0-100, 101-200, 201-300, and so on. This method defines the 
number of classes, as well as the class intervals. This classification 
works best when you have data ranges that are fairly commonly under-
stood and well known, such as percentages or temperatures.
 
✓ Defined interval: This method allows you to define the specific ranges 
of data and lets the software decide how many classes you need. 
Suppose you tell the software that you want it to divide the percent of 
people who voted in the last election into intervals based on 5-year age 
groups. But you’ve already restricted the dataset to only those people 
between the ages of 30 and 59. In this case, your software will create 
six classes reflecting your choices: age groups 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 
50-54, and 55-59.

284
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
 
✓ Quantiles: This method counts features so that each class has the same 
number of features (for example, the same number of counties). If you 
know that your data are distributed in a linear fashion, you can use 
this approach effectively. If wildly different data occur together or very 
similar data occur in different classes, you can increase the number of 
classes you use to better represent the data classes using quantiles.
 
✓ Natural breaks: I’m rather fond of this approach because I can see the 
visual changes in the categories and put in the class breaks where they 
occur naturally. Classes created this way are more likely to be represen-
tative of how data should logically be classed. The visual changes occur 
where the data have large jumps or dips so they are very easy to pick out.
 
✓ Geometrical intervals: Many datasets change in non-linear fashion, for 
example, logarithmically. This approach, designed for continuous data, 
attempts to put the same number of data occurrences in each class 
regardless of what their values are.
 
✓ Standard deviations: If you’re sure that your data are distributed in a 
bell shape (that is, normally distributed), you might want to use this 
method because it’s based on sound statistical theory. This classifica-
tion method is designed to use the standard deviations above and below 
the mean, which identifies the category value based on that standard 
distance from the mean. ESRI recommends using two colors when you 
employ this method — one color for those values above the mean and 
one for those below the mean.
 
✓ Area-based: Only some software offers this approach. It allows you to 
use a variety of the other methods, but it divides the classes based not 
on the distribution of the data, but rather on the distribution of the 
amount of area for each category. This approach gives you quite a bit of 
control over the visual appearance of the map and adjusts for graphical 
artifacts such as disproportionately large polygons that skew the map’s 
appearance.
Using map elements
Map elements are the graphic devices that cartographers include on a map. 
Here’s a list of the standard map elements (see Figure 18-2):
 
✓ Title: Gives the reader a context for understanding the map.
 
✓ Legend: Explains what the content and classes mean.
 
✓ Scale: Helps the reader know how big the area is and how much general-
ization to expect.

285
 Chapter 18: Producing Cartographic Output
 
✓ Credits: Hey, here’s where you can take credit for your hard mapmaking 
work. Nothing wrong with that!
 
✓ Mapped areas: The place where you actually put the geography.
 
✓ Graticules: A grid of fine lines used to determine scale and position of 
mapped objects. Maps don’t always need graticules, but they often make 
a map look really professional.
 
✓ Borders: Sometimes called neat lines because they surround the map 
area and make the map look orderly and contained.
 
✓ Symbols: You can’t really put the mapped areas on the map without 
using symbols that represent the real geography.
 
✓ Place names: The names of the locations that are mapped so the reader 
can find them on the map.
Keep in mind that map standards are always changing, so these elements 
may be different from what you’ve seen in the past — and they may change 
in the future.

Factoring in graphic map design
A map offers more than just a way to store and retrieve data. Its primary 
functions are analysis and display. Selecting the correct data, scales, projec-
tions, classes, and map elements helps you make sure that you’re creating 
Purchasing a monitor
Before you ever put ink on paper, your GIS 
displays the maps on your computer monitor. 
Monitors come in a wide variety of shapes, 
sizes, resolutions, and contrast levels. Some 
monitors are CRT technology (based on old-
style television tubes), some are LCD (liquid 
crystal display), and others are plasma-based. 
Some monitors can handle millions of colors, 
and others are more limited.
Your visualization needs, budget, and even light-
ing conditions can affect your decision about 
what type (or types) of monitor(s) you need. 
Some systems employ two monitors so that 
they can separate graphics and text. You don’t 
need a high-quality, high-resolution monitor for 
the text side of the system, but you might for the 
graphics side. Some monitors look washed out 
if you view them at an angle or surround them 
with too much light.
GIS vendors often bundle the hardware to their 
software. You can often get excellent compati-
bility between the software and the hardware in 
these bundles because the vendors are familiar 
with the capabilities of their software relative 
to the hardware. Even if you don’t purchase a 
package that includes both your GIS hardware 
and software, you can ask your software sup-
plier which monitor systems it recommends for 
your application. Suppliers normally have many 
different types of users, and the users provide 
very good feedback on what works and what 
doesn’t. Here are some basic aspects of graph-
ics monitors for you to ask about:
 ✓ Resolution
 ✓ Size
 ✓ Refresh rate
 ✓ Material (whether it’s CRT, LCD, or plasma)
 ✓ Number of colors
 ✓ Number of monitors (usually one 
versus two)
 ✓ Reliability
 ✓ Compatibility with the software
 ✓ Vendor responsiveness and warranties
When you ask your GIS vendor about these 
specifications, be sure that you know your 
needs. In particular, be able to explain your 
lighting, space configuration, user require-
ments, and ergonomics. The vendor may want 
to know how many stations you need and 
whether any of your technicians have visual or 
other impairments that affect seating and view-
ing. If one of your technicians, for example, is 
in a wheelchair, his or her monitor needs may 
be quite different than those who will sit in an 
office chair to view the monitor, depending on 
the desk configuration. You may also have users 
who are colorblind and therefore don’t need a 
massive color palette (as long as the monitor 
can display plenty of gray shades). In some 
cases, you might want to have a very large 
monitor or a projection system so that you can 
share the results or the preliminary analyses 
with your clients comfortably.

287
 Chapter 18: Producing Cartographic Output
a readable map. But you need to remember that the map is also a graphic 
device — and some graphics are nicer than others. This aspect of cartog-
raphy, called graphic map design, borrows heavily from traditional art and 
graphic design principles, as well. Here are a few questions to ask yourself 
while you look over your finished product:
 
✓ Does the map look unbalanced (not visually leaning to one side)? If it 
does, you need to move the map elements around. Use the text, titles, 
and legend to help you balance the map graphically.
 
✓ Can you read the lettering? You need to know how close the readers 
are going to be to your map. Put yourself in their shoes and increase the 
lettering as needed.
 
✓ Do the features stand out? Contrast is the basis of seeing. Putting pink 
on yellow might work for a designer hat, but this color combination 
doesn’t help a map-reader see the objects you want him to see.
 
✓ Does the reader know what to focus on? Use a technique called figure 
ground where you make sure the background is rather vanilla and the 
figure (what you want the reader to see) stands out. You may also want 
to use visual hierarchy — using line thicknesses to help distinguish the 
importance of geographic features such as nations, states, and counties.
 
✓ Do you feel dizzy looking at your map? This question may sound 
funny, but it happens. Poor colors, colliding line patterns, and spiraling 
shapes make readers uncomfortable — which means they don’t want to 
read your map, and you’ve failed as a map designer.
Over time, you become sensitized to what works and what doesn’t work in 
graphic map design. When you look at art, you know what you like and what 
you don’t like. The same is true of maps. After you become familiar with the 
terminology of art, you can explain why you like or don’t like art. In the same 
way, when you become familiar with cartographic design language, you can 
do the same with maps.
 
Look at a lot of maps. If you want to be a better mapmaker, you need to see 
what works and what doesn’t work. If you go to GIS conferences, you can see 
tons of maps, both good and bad.
Understanding Cartograms
For most GIS cartographic output, the user needs the traditional map. Most 
users are most comfortable with the typical thematic map output if you keep 
them apprised while the output progresses. In almost all situations, the usual 
types of maps make their point quite nicely. Sometimes, however, you might 
want to make a point that the usual display just doesn’t convey with the impact 

288
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
you want. When you really want to elicit a reaction from the map reader, you 
can use a really cool type of map called a cartogram. A cartogram is a map that 
exaggerates the size of geographic space based on the descriptive attributes, 
instead of presenting the space in its accurately scaled size and shape. You use 
a cartogram to communicate a specific aspect of the mapped information more 
effectively.
In traditional maps, the sizes of the land areas and the lengths of line features 
portray (as closely as possible) the proportional relationship in their scaled 
size. This proportional look makes sense, of course, when the features and 
their relative sizes are familiar to the audience. When you distort these area 
sizes or change the lengths of features, the reader becomes uncomfortable. 
This discomfort may be useful to elicit the response you want, or it may detract 
from that response if the viewer is unfamiliar with the area portrayed on the 
map. You must be aware of the target audience’s map reading skills and under-
standing of the portrayed geography before attempting to use cartograms.
 
Although you don’t want to go out of your way to make your reader uncom-
fortable with an out-of-proportion map, sometimes the shock of such distor-
tions has the impact on the viewer that you want. Impressionistic artists use 
this technique in their work to elicit a response rather than to represent real-
ity as accurately as possible. Cartographers use distortion to draw attention 
to a particular result. These distortions are performed on two types of map 
elements: areas and distances.
Attracting attention with area cartograms
Area cartograms, often called value-by-area maps, distort the sizes of the 
polygons based on the attribute quantity, rather than its actual physical size. 
Among the most common examples of a value-by-area map is the analysis 
of U.S. presidential election results, like the one shown in Figure 18-3. In this 
figure, the top map is a traditional choropleth map (a map presenting data on 
an area-by-area basis) that shows the actual scaled size of the United States. 
The darker states (the West Coast, East Coast, and areas near the Great 
Lakes) voted for the Democratic candidate, and the remainder (what appears 
to be the vast majority of the country) voted for the Republican candidate. 
But when you distort the areas based on the states’ electoral votes (the 
number of votes each state gets based on its population), the election results 
seem much closer than in the original map.
 
Use value-by-area maps to force the reader to focus on the value of the attribute 
represented by each area (in Figure 18-3, the electoral votes for each candidate), 
rather than on the size that the map features take when accurately scaled.

289
 Chapter 18: Producing Cartographic Output
Figure 18-3 shows that all the states (polygons) are connected. This type of 
area cartogram is called a contiguous cartogram. You can also make an area 
cartogram by exploding the polygons so that they’re relatively close to their 
proper locations but no longer connected. This type of area cartogram is 
called a non-contiguous cartogram (Figure 18-4).

Part V: GIS Output and Application 
Contiguous and non-contiguous area cartograms don’t have any real advan-
tages or disadvantages. Contiguous area cartograms distort shapes, and 
non-contiguous area cartograms distort relative positions. When deciding 
which cartogram style to use, consider your potential map readers. The less 
cartogram experience the readers have, the more they rely on shape, so the 
non-contiguous style might make sense to them. However, if the shapes are 
unfamiliar to your readers, the contiguous, shape-distorted style may be as 
good a choice because the reader is not relying on shape to interpret the map.
Distorting distance with linear cartograms
Linear cartograms distort distances to make their point. Perhaps the most 
famous linear cartogram, and arguably the first published in the geographical 
literature (research papers written by geographers), is called the central-
point cartogram (see Figure 18-5). The central-point cartogram illustrates 
the time it takes to travel from a central point to every other place in a city. 
When travel time lines are displayed with traditional mapping techniques, 
the time lines are distorted based on the impact of the road network on 
travel. In Figure 18-5, the travel time lines are concentric, so the map of the 
city is distorted so that the time travel lines can remain circles. You can dis-
play a network analysis this way, rather than with a typical map. (Chapter 15 
covers network analysis in detail.)
Mapping sequence with 
routed line cartograms
Perhaps the most used, but often unrecognized, linear cartogram is a routed 
line cartogram. Busses and mass transit trains display this kind of cartogram 
to illustrate the stops in their proper sequence. When you travel on mass 
transit, you don’t really need to know the distance you travel. You do need 
to know when your stop occurs within a linear sequence of stops, though. To 
create this type of map, you ignore the distance between stops and include 
only the sequence of stops. Figure 18-6 shows an example from a train 
system.
 
Use routed line cartograms if the sequence of places is more important than 
their distances from each other.

M
aps are the traditional output from GIS, but not everyone is well-
versed in reading maps — especially thematic maps (which I talk 
about in Chapter 2), the typical type of maps resulting from GIS data retrieval 
or analysis. I’ve been to several conferences where people got into lengthy, 
often heated, discussions about exactly what a particular map was trying to 
communicate. Such disagreement often happens because of poor cartogra-
phy, but it can also happen because of the map reader’s lack of familiarity 
with map symbols, classification strategies, and legends.
The ultimate goal of GIS is to communicate results. Many people are familiar 
with lists, tables, statistics, travel directions, and other non-map-like forms 
of communication. If the intended recipients of your GIS output are more 
comfortable with these alternatives to maps, then why not provide them with 
these forms of communication, rather than — or, at least, in addition to — 
cartographic output?
GIS has many ways to communicate results that are not purely cartographic. 
This chapter helps you with a few of these methods so that you’re ready to 
deliver your GIS output to meet the needs of diverse audiences.

Part V: GIS Output and Application 
Looking for Routings and 
Travel Directions
GIS provides many opportunities to find shortest routes, fastest routes, and 
even the most scenic routes along a road network. (Chapter 15 discusses 
such routes, which you can identify in networks.) Such analyses often give 
you maps that highlight the route. In some cases, a non-graphical list of turn-
by-turn directions accompanies the map, as shown in Figure 19-1. Travelers 
charged with navigation duties often prefer this type of output because they 
can refer to it and reference the information piece by piece.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Turn-by-turn 
output from 
MapQuest.
 
Travel directions from a service such as MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) 
are normally based on shortest-path distance, but GIS software (and even 
online mapping systems) allows you to request directions based on time, 
rather than distance. In some instances, the software even allows you to 
select which specific streets you want to avoid. Road and highway icons that 
resemble their respective road signs add a bit of color to the output and can 
also help the readers find the individual streets.
Getting Customer Lists and 
Statistical Data
The business GIS user often wants information about customers or potential 
customers. One typical application uses GIS to search business databases 
for names, addresses, purchases, e-mail addresses, and a host of other infor-
mation that a business uses for target advertising. In some situations, every 
time you scan a purchase and use a credit card, the store records who you 

295
 Chapter 19: Generating Non-Cartographic Output
are and what you purchased. By comparing that record to demographic data 
(selected characteristics of the general population), businesses can actually 
target different parts of a city for specific marketing campaigns.
Although maps can provide a general description of customer type and loca-
tion, the busy business professional often wants a report, rather than a map. 
In some cases, the report includes maps as part of the document. GIS pro-
duces two general types of reports that are suited to business uses:
 
✓ Tabular reports: Have a spreadsheet-like layout
 
✓ Columnar reports: Have a newspaper column layout
Whether you choose the tabular- or columnar-report format, you can sort by 
any data field that the report contains. For example, you can list cities alpha-
betically, by population, market share, or total volume of business. Another 
useful tool in the GIS reporting toolkit generates summary statistics, such as 
sum, mean, range, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum for any 
data field.
Typically, you can more easily understand summary statistics when they’re 
presented graphically through bar charts, histograms, line graphs, pie charts, 
scatterplots, and other forms of non-cartographic graphic output. Most GIS 
software gives you the option of including both tables and graphs directly on 
the map itself. Figure 19-2 shows a graphic presentation of summary statistics.
 
Figure 19-2: 
A graph 
showing 
summary 
statistics.
 
GIS software often presents statistical and tabular data as graphs because 
graphs provide a visual, easy-to-understand means of communication. Used 
alone, graphs are handy, but GIS analysts often use them to complement a 
map because the reader can gather information faster from the graph than 
from only the map itself. Most GIS software allows you to not only produce 
maps of GIS data, but also non-spatial data associated with the map. When 
you base this non-spatial data on the map attributes, the GIS often links that 
data to the map so that when the data changes, so does the graph. You can 
even use the same color schemes to make comparisons more natural.

296
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
GIS
 
In addition to generating maps, a GIS can present virtually any of its data as 
statistical tables or graphical charts and diagrams. You have a staggering 
volume of potential output. Here’s a list of some practical and frequently used 
GIS output that works well in non-cartographic formats:
 
✓ Market share by region or quarter
 
✓ Number of customers in a particular city, county, state, or neighborhood
 
✓ Lightning strikes by state
 
✓ Customer or potential customer profiles by region
 
✓ Crop yields and changes in crop yield by year
 
✓ Lists of households not currently subscribing to a newspaper
 
✓ Lists of property tax valuation for counties
 
You can more easily read and interpret maps if you include a linked table or 
graph either on or near the map itself (as shown in Figure 19-3). If you use 
matching colors to show the correspondence between the map symbols and 
the tabular or graphed data, you can also improve users’ understanding.

 Chapter 19: Generating Non-Cartographic Output
Producing Alarms and Signals 
(Audio and Video)
GIS
 Sometimes, GIS produces output that it can’t put in a map or graph. Some 
home security systems, many E911 systems, and a growing number of market-
ing and government bodies now use automated electronic and signaling sys-
tems that, at least in part, employ GIS technologies. Here are some examples:
 
✓ The output from analysis of registered voters could result in automated 
telephone calls asking for your vote.
 
✓ Fire and emergency services may receive signals from dispatchers that 
include both an audible alarm and even a set of routing directions in the 
vehicle’s GPS unit.
 
✓ Some military hardware systems combine GPS, GIS, and remote sensing 
technologies to direct automated aircraft to particular targets.
 
✓ In precision agriculture solutions, certain combinations of input trigger 
valves to open and close on machinery that releases specific amounts of 
fertilizer or pesticide.
 
✓ Real-time information is sent between GIS operators and forest-fire 
fighters.
 
✓ Automobile onboard navigation systems often have voice command and 
even updated traffic information as part of their output.
Benefiting from Virtual Output
With newer, faster computers and better graphics output devices, GIS has a 
new set of possibilities for presenting GIS data and analytical results. The fol-
lowing sections show you two major types — animations and flythroughs — 
both of which involve the development of short movie clips. These types of 
video output give GIS users a totally different perspective on the data.
Animating your maps
GIS animations are a form of geographic visualization that shows dynamic 
changes to a single map layer or even multiple map layers simultaneously to 
allow visual comparisons. You most commonly use GIS animations to depict 
geographic movements (for example, tracking the movement of wildlife) and 
temporal changes (such as changes in land cover patterns over many years).

298
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
Animations show changes — which might take days or weeks to occur — at a 
fast pace so that you can see trends you might otherwise miss. Alternatively, 
if you have a lot of data about changes that occur very quickly, you can 
use animation to present those changes slowly and, again, identify changes 
you might not otherwise catch. Some circumstances might warrant moving 
through an animation backward and forward so that you can focus on spe-
cific events in the sequence.
 
Here are several possible uses of animations in GIS:
 
✓ Tracking hurricanes and other weather-related phenomena
 
✓ Keeping tabs on the movements of delivery trucks that have built-in GPS 
units
 
✓ Watching changes in climatic data, such as temperature, pressure, and 
precipitation, over months or even years to observe climate change
 
✓ Viewing airline flights to detect possible locations for high traffic con-
centrations and potential accidents
 
✓ Tracking radio-collared wildlife species to identify habitat preferences
 
✓ Examining land-use change through time to determine major trends
 
✓ Observing how crime hot spots change throughout the day, during the 
week, or even at different seasons
 
✓ Watching changes in market share of your own and competing busi-
nesses to identify where new businesses are impacting your sales
 
Use GIS data presented as animations when you want to focus on pattern 
changes or feature movements through time.
Getting the most from flythroughs
The flythrough is a form of animation that happens in three dimensions. Just 
like the term says, the flythrough allows you to visually fly through a three-
dimensional version of your map. You can find a common example of flyth-
roughs in software such as Google Earth, but most professional GIS packages 
also possess this capability and give you total control over how the flight 
moves. You control the flight path or track, perspectives, and camera loca-
tions of the flythroughs in two ways:
GIS

299
 Chapter 19: Generating Non-Cartographic Output
 
✓ By setting up a sequential path: You select a number of key locations 
that you want to visit in the sequence that you want to view them to 
create the general flythrough path.
 
✓ By recording your movements during a flight simulation: You control 
the speed of the flythrough based on the speed at which you move 
during the recording process.
 
Whether you set up a path or use the simulator approach, the software 
records a sufficient number of frames per second so that when the flythrough 
is played back, it moves smoothly.
GIS
 Flythrough is useful for the following GIS applications:
 
✓ Terrain evaluations: To detect landscape features or compare terrain 
texture (ruggedness or smoothness)
 
✓ Urban impact assessment: To show the effect of urban structures on wind
 
✓ Political and cultural studies: To illustrate the often radically different 
patterns that occur as you cross political boundaries worldwide
 
✓ Damage estimation: In which flying through an entire valley allows you 
to observe flood conditions
 
✓ Ecological research: Making visual comparisons of elevation levels to 
changes in the size and composition of vegetation
I used this technique to show how datum errors can result in strange mis-
matches of aerial features on topography. As shown in a snapshot of a fly-
through around Tortugas Mountain in Las Cruces, New Mexico (see Figure 
19-4), the letter A was turned upside down because the Digital Elevation 
Model (DEM) and the aerial photography used different datums. (I talk about 
datums in Chapter 2.)
Vendors usually save flythrough animations in some proprietary format, but 
in most cases, you can also export flythroughs as Audio Video Interleave 
(.avi) or Quicktime (.mov) files that you can play back by using Windows 
Media Player or QuickTime.
 
Use flythroughs when you need multiple views of a topographic feature or 
when you want to see the relationships that might exist between elevation and 
other features on the surface.

GIS in Organizations
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how organizational structures affect GIS integration
▶ Knowing the types of organizations that benefit most from GIS
▶ Incorporating GIS in your organization
G
IS is much more than just software and hardware. You need data, train-
ing, space, personnel, funding, technical support, and many other 
elements that work together to make your GIS function properly. Your organi-
zation must undergo fundamental changes in the way it functions, both in its 
internal and external interactions. You can make these changes extremely posi-
tive, if you incorporate GIS effectively. The guidelines in this chapter help you 
ensure that when your organization adopts GIS, the benefit outweighs the cost.
Understanding How Your Organization’s 
Interactions Change
GIS fundamentally changes the way an organization works. Not only does 
your organization change, but so do interactions within the organization. 
You interact with internal players, meaning your organization’s GIS operators, 
managers, and other GIS personnel. But you and they also must obtain data, 
supply output, purchase equipment, get training, and participate in many 
other tasks that involve the larger GIS community, called external players.
Internal players include the following general groups:
 
✓ System users: Use GIS to solve problems, provide solutions, and supply 
decision support for the organization. Their skills generally include spa-
tial problem solving (for example, performing the actual analysis on the 
data) and model building (such as systematically applying large num-
bers of analytical techniques to solve larger problems).

302
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
 
✓ System operators: Know the inner workings of the software, can sup-
port the system users through troubleshooting and workarounds, and 
have specialized knowledge about the GIS. They usually provide security 
and training, as well. These people are highly knowledgeable about the 
capabilities of the GIS and its place in the organization, have advanced 
technical training, and work with the GIS every day.
 
✓ System sponsor: Provides the financial support for the entire system. 
The system sponsor isn’t a person — it’s the organization itself, or a sub-
division or unit within the organization. This group provides the funding 
for data, hardware, software, space, utilities, training, salaries, and any-
thing else related to the GIS. Without the system sponsor, the GIS opera-
tions don’t exist. The system sponsor also makes sure that the system 
remains necessary to the organization, thereby guaranteeing long-term 
viability and preventing losses from abandoned GIS investment.
External players include the following general groups:
 
✓ GIS supplier: The GIS vendor that supplies the software (and sometimes 
hardware), technical support, and training.
 
✓ Data supplier: Two types of data suppliers exist, public and private:
 
• Public sources: Often government organizations or public GIS data 
clearinghouses, including universities that provide data on an as-is 
basis (often free or inexpensively, as a cost recovery)
 
• Private organizations: Typically charge for data but often provide 
value-added data that’s targeted to your needs
 
✓ Applications developer: One quick way to address short-term, project-
specific needs is to hire outside professionals, called applications devel-
opers, to (guess what?) develop an application that has just the right 
data, analytical models, and user interfaces.
 
✓ GIS systems analyst: Systems analysts look at the overall operation 
of your GIS to ensure its initial and long-term successful integration 
into the organization. Many systems analysts, sometimes called system 
designers, are employees of the GIS supplier or software company that 
you purchase from. After all, who knows the capabilities of the system 
and how it interfaces any better?
Categorizing the Types of Organizations 
That Use GIS
GIS may be integral to the operation of an organization (enterprise); provide 
data storage, archiving, and retrieval; or act simply as an occasional tool 
for specific analyses on an individual department basis. These levels of 

303
 Chapter 20: GIS in Organizations
organizational integration are often not static. Instead, they change when 
an organization recognizes the potential usefulness of the GIS for other 
branches of that organization.
Some people try to categorize the types of organizations that use GIS based 
on their level of integration and the ways that they use the GIS. I find this 
approach a bit difficult to deal with because both organizations and the sys-
tems they incorporate grow.
 
Growth is a fundamental characteristic of any successful organization or 
system, and this growth changes the way GIS works in an organization 
through time. To design a GIS based on its initial incorporation for limited 
use — rather than for its likely eventual adoption on a larger scale — forces 
a constant re-evaluation of the design process itself, in addition to the organi-
zational GIS design. So, rather than take this somewhat untenable approach, I 
show you what I call the basic three types of GIS organizations in the following 
sections.
Private/commercial
Many GIS designers speak of the spatial information product (SIP) — the 
planned output from GIS analysis. In most private and commercial business 
operations, the SIP is a product that provides income to the company. Some 
commercial companies produce output (SIPs) that they make available for 
purchase, and others produce output for some other organization that has 
limited GIS capabilities. In the latter case, the output still provides income to 
the commercial firm.
GIS
 
Here are some example private and commercial company types that use GIS 
and the SIPs they might produce:
 
✓ Mapping companies use GIS to produce maps for sale to the general 
public.
 
✓ Consulting firms produce viable GIS models for organizations that oper-
ate GIS but lack the necessary personnel resources to create their own 
models.
 
✓ GIS data providers develop clean, user-based, value-added datasets for 
other organizations so that those organizations can spend less time con-
verting data and more time analyzing those data.
 
✓ Economic placement companies develop location and allocation plans 
for businesses so that those businesses know the most economically 
feasible place to put their next store.
 
✓ Real estate companies link their GIS software to the Multiple Listing 
Service (MLS), providing its agents with the means to locate properties, 
provide virtual tours, and link properties on a map.

304
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
 
✓ Vineyards use GIS to schedule plantings, decide on watering and appli-
cations of supplemental fertilizer, manage harvests, and control work-
flow during different times of year to guarantee the highest yields.
The applications in the preceding list have one thing in common — the devel-
opment of a tool (a SIP) that improves the income stream of the organization. 
Such organizations are structured around that goal. GIS designs must com-
plement that same goal — otherwise, the company won’t find the GIS very 
useful and won’t implement it.
Government
A modified version of the spatial information product idea works in govern-
ment organizations, accommodating the output needs of such organizations. 
Governments and government-related organizations are generally in the busi-
ness of controlling and protecting large groups of people through legislation 
and mandates. And so, the GIS solutions that these organizations use provide 
information about people, as well as the factors that affect them (for exam-
ple, natural and man-made resources, urban and infrastructure development, 
weather and environmental conditions, and so on).
 
Here are some examples of governmental bodies that use GIS:
 
✓ Management agencies: Control and protect the many aspects of the 
environment, including land use, agriculture, minerals, forests, ocean 
resources, parks, recreation areas, scenic natural areas, and many 
others.
 
✓ Law enforcement and corrections agencies: Identify, target, and pre-
vent crime, as well as control and manage people who are incarcerated 
or on parole.
 
✓ Medical agencies: Monitor disease, isolate causal factors for outbreaks, 
allocate medical personnel to infected areas, and even decide where to 
place medical facilities.
 
✓ Meteorological and climate centers: Predict short-term weather phe-
nomena, protect people and property from short-term severe storm 
events, and determine the long-term impacts of climate change.
 
✓ Emergency management agencies: Serve the needs of victims of natural 
and man-made disasters. Examples of such disasters include floods, hur-
ricanes, tornados, earthquakes, chemical spills, riots, and conflict.
 
✓ Military and military support organizations: Protect the nation against 
armed aggression through intelligence, surveillance, military planning, 
troop and hardware deployment, and logistics.
GIS

305
 Chapter 20: GIS in Organizations
All the organizations in the preceding list are mission oriented. They typically 
have mission statements that clearly and concisely outline their goals, objec-
tives, and mandates. Any GIS design for such organizations must target the 
fulfillment of those mandates. Otherwise, the organization won’t adopt, or 
successfully implement the GIS.
Non-profit/educational
Conservation, relief, philanthropic, research, and educational organiza-
tions and foundations aren’t in operation to make money, nor do they have 
specific government mandates. They often decide their objectives based 
on their own mission statements, but those mission statements are highly 
variable because of the wide variety of tasks, and change very quickly as a 
response to changing demands and circumstances. Some organizations, such 
as research organizations, don’t actually know what their final output might 
be. Instead, they need the flexibility to perform as wide a range of analyses as 
possible.
GIS
 
Here are some examples to demonstrate the wildly different non-profit organi-
zations and the ways they might use GIS:
 
✓ A relief organization needs to manage the collection, packaging, and 
dissemination of food and medical supplies to a third world nation that 
has few roads and little equipment.
 
✓ A conservation group is trying to find land that has a high level of wild-
life habitat diversity and owners who are willing to negotiate conserva-
tion easements or the outright sale of the land.
 
✓ A university department wants to develop a combination teaching and 
research laboratory that can support equipment, software licensing, 
datasets, and continued software training for extended periods of time.
 
✓ A philanthropic organization picks people for funding based on their 
contribution to research that results in improvements to the human 
condition. The organization needs to be able to identify these individu-
als and wants to spread such awards around geographically.
 
✓ A college admissions department wants to target students from across 
the nation whose entrance exam scores and scholastic potential are in 
the top 5 percent of their graduating classes.
You can design a GIS for organizations that have variable needs (such as the 
examples in the preceding list), but you need to exercise great care. The spa-
tial information product (for example, the list with names and addresses of 
targeted students) might be the primary need for the GIS. But in some cases, 

306
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
simply having the system in place for a long time might satisfy a major need 
that employees have for flexible access and opportunities for experimenta-
tion and modeling. Some organizations also have the added complexity of 
rapid turnover in personnel. So, their training needs may be more important 
than the hardware or software needs. In some cases, these kinds of organiza-
tions use GIS only periodically, so they have minimal operational needs. In 
these situations, the organizations may prefer to outsource their GIS opera-
tions rather than incurring the expense of operating an in-house system.
Designing and Introducing a 
GIS for Your Organization
Each organization is unique. Each has its own culture, organizational struc-
ture, history and traditions, needs and mandates, and vision. These differ-
ences have a profound impact on whether the organization can effectively 
use GIS, or any technology, and whether it can easily integrate that technol-
ogy into the existing operations. So, you need a thorough knowledge of the 
structure of an organization — including how decisions flow from place to 
place, who has what job responsibilities, and how general operations work — 
to be able to incorporate GIS effectively into the organization.
 
You can really begin to understand an organization’s structure by creating, or 
having a consultant create, a detailed organizational diagram. Such a diagram 
helps define where the GIS fits within the organization and shows who answers 
to whom. GIS is about sharing data resources, and an organization’s structure 
can help you see how, where, and to what extent data sharing takes place.
Organizations don’t necessarily process and share data in the same fashion, 
but instead, have differing resources, approaches, and methods, as follows:
 
✓ Some organizations’ systems are designed to widely acquire data and 
information — but to disseminate it to only specific individuals. GIS 
output must follow the data path that exists in your organization.
 
✓ The technology of GIS requires a fundamental understanding of both 
geographic principles and technology. GIS training becomes very impor-
tant if you find that your organization is composed largely of people who 
have avoided both technology and geography.
 
✓ Some organizations have very rigid hierarchical structures with equally 
rigid paths for operations and information flow; others are loose and flex-
ible, so responsibilities and information flow freely among employees. The 
GIS operations should fit into your own organization’s hierarchy.

307
 Chapter 20: GIS in Organizations
Understanding how technology 
affects organizations
Introducing technology into any organization changes the way people work 
within the organization. The introduction of the first personal computer into 
the office environment changed the way office assistants prepared docu-
ments. The introduction of the cellular telephone allowed people to “take the 
office on the road.” When e-mail was introduced, information moved at the 
speed of light and allowed documents to be shared instantly. In many cases, 
these changes began as rather innocuous curiosities. Today, people are con-
nected through local area networks and the Internet, and employees are inex-
tricably linked to job-related software to do their jobs. In short, people work 
differently than they did before the computer was incorporated into their 
daily work.
Introducing GIS changes an organization in the following ways:
 
✓ Change in priorities: While the GIS becomes more functional, especially 
when it improves productivity, the priorities of the organization may 
shift to take advantage of these improvements.
 
✓ Change in the organizational hierarchy: While the system grows, the 
GIS may become more important to organizational groups you hadn’t 
anticipated. Keeping your organizational diagram current helps you 
track the various groups and their needs.
 
✓ Change in workflow: GIS changes who does what, how they do it, and 
when it gets done. Tasks that took weeks if performed by hand with 
analog maps, might take hours with GIS. However, the people doing the 
work might need completely different skills, which could cause manag-
ers to hire different personnel to accomplish the same tasks.
 
✓ Change in the types and amounts of products: Because GIS offers differ-
ent output, such as animations, flythroughs, and many more, the prod-
ucts you generate may augment or even replace your existing ones.
 
✓ Changes in training needs: The speed of change is increasing. Both the 
organization and the individuals may need training to keep up with 
new developments. You definitely need to have a well-designed plan for 
training.
 
✓ Change in financial distribution: You can’t get GIS on the cheap. You 
may need to spend money on GIS analysts, rather than field personnel.
 
✓ Change in space allocation and design: You might want to get rid of 
some of those map cases and get a good climate-controlled room or two.

308
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
Managing people problems
Organizations require people — people to run them, people to supply them, 
people to finance them, and people to manage them. Well, not surprisingly, 
GIS also requires people. Good, dedicated, hard-working, well-equipped, 
happy people can make any operation (including GIS) function at peak 
efficiency. On the other hand, ineffective, apathetic, lazy, poorly trained, 
disgruntled people can just as easily destroy any chance for an operation’s 
survival.
Nearly every recent GIS system-wide failure has resulted from people and 
planning problems, not from poor data, computer issues, software, or earth-
quakes. Here are a few scenarios that can result in failure:
 
✓ Ineffective sponsorship: Some systems fail because the system sponsor 
loses interest when the organization or governing body doesn’t see the 
value and removes support. This situation might occur because of lack 
of information, misinformation, or a lack of useful output. Organizations 
need someone to champion the GIS so that the system sponsor is always 
aware of its potential and actual successes.
 
✓ Missing or faulty goals: A GIS that has no goals (or has goals that are 
at odds with the overall organization’s goals) is almost certain to fail or 
operate poorly. I’ve seen more than one system fail because it was built 
around sources of data (such as new sensors and GPS), rather than with 
an idea of products or potential clientele.
 
✓ Incomplete implementation: Systems that meet only part of the organi-
zation’s spatial data goals are a failure, even if they keep operating. For 
example, you may have five units that need spatial products, but only 
three of them use the GIS. This problem can stem from unit managers 
not understanding the usefulness of GIS data. Or perhaps certain units 
or individuals resist the technology because they don’t see the useful-
ness or fear that introducing GIS might compromise their position in the 
organization.
 
 I’ve seen system implementations that only partially meet each goal of 
the organization. You might have five units that all need GIS output, but 
none of them gets all the products they require. In many cases, this situ-
ation occurs because the system sponsor hasn’t allocated the necessary 
resources to complete the implementation, which results in a lack of 
trained personnel (or training for existing personnel), insufficient data, 
or a lack of education about the potential for the GIS.
 
✓ Lack of cooperation: Turf wars, particularly within organizations that 
have multiple GIS-related operations, have caused many GIS implemen-
tations to operate poorly. Large, complex, multi-user organizations 
need strong management when data sharing, equipment access, and 
jealousy about disparate resource allocation cause internal units to 
resist cooperating.

309
 Chapter 20: GIS in Organizations
 
✓ Resistance to change: Employees, particularly long-time employees who 
might feel marginalized by the new technology, may drag their feet when 
it comes to adopting unfamiliar technology. Here’s an old and still quite 
true saying: If they’re not part of the solution, they’re part of the problem.
 
People problems aren’t unique to GIS operations. One of the biggest issues 
with incorporating GIS into organizations is that it introduces a massive 
increase in technological dependence. This new technology causes changes in 
how work is done and in the expectations of increased productivity. And both 
technology and change are accelerating.
Planning for integration
Ken Eason devised a series of principles (known, not surprisingly, as Eason’s 
principles) that can help you introduce any technology into existing organiza-
tional structures:
 
✓ Serve the organization’s needs, rather than just provide technical sup-
port. Make the integration of GIS part of the organization; don’t relegate 
it to some secondary status, like you would fixing broken computers or 
reformatting hard drives.
 
✓ Give employees the ability and willingness to make the system work. 
Employees who can’t contribute to the system because they lack the 
necessary knowledge or ability often become unwilling to support that 
system.
 
✓ Prepare a planned process of change based on how the organization 
workflow will change. Because organizations typically have their own 
structure, any change in that structure should produce as little disrup-
tion as possible.
 
✓ Make employees stakeholders in the system. For example, you can tie 
job responsibility or individual employee objectives to GIS system suc-
cess. Employees who benefit from innovation will support it.
 
✓ Make sure that the system meets the organization’s goals or solves a 
problem. Incorporating new technology because it’s hot, rather than to 
address existing goals, often causes the organization to stray from its 
original purpose.
 
✓ Provide a system that allows cooperation and make incumbent 
employees feel like they’re a part of that system. Established, loyal 
employees are an asset to any organization, so give them every opportu-
nity to become integrated into the new approaches.
 
✓ Meet the needs of the individual employees. If the system makes the 
workload easier or reduces employees’ stress, allowing them to enjoy 
their work more, that system has a much better chance of success.

310
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
 
✓ Provide education and training for the organization’s management 
and the individual employees. Although managers may not be respon-
sible for operating the GIS, they need to understand its relevance to the 
organization’s goals. GIS is advanced technology, and it’s always chang-
ing. The more employees know about the technology, the more quickly 
they can understand and fully integrate it.
 
✓ Plan a progressive form of evolutionary growth. Changes in organiza-
tional needs, technological innovations, software updates, and the natu-
ral growth of the GIS demand that you have planning for such changes in 
place to avoid disruption in the workflow.
 
✓ Complement existing design principles and organizational change 
methodologies. The more closely the new approach functions like the 
old, the more quickly both management and employees will adopt it, 
leading to a smooth transition.
Looking Before You Leap 
(And Afterwards, Too)
You can’t design and implement a GIS in your organization without a little 
upfront homework. And you can’t maintain successful GIS operations without 
checking up on how the system is working. But you can accomplish both — the 
upfront homework and ongoing checkups — by performing some key analyses.
Performing needs analysis
Organizations that plan to adopt GIS don’t always know their needs. I’ve been 
involved in some design projects in which the organization knew a great deal 
about what GIS is and how they wanted to use it. More commonly, though, 
organizations that are considering GIS seldom know their GIS needs, and they 
also don’t understand the potential of GIS to fundamentally change how the 
organization’s operations get done. Most organizations that begin to incor-
porate GIS benefit from an initial needs analysis. This kind of analysis can get 
complicated and detailed. Each GIS design consultant seems to have a differ-
ent approach.
Your GIS implementation has four major areas where you must assess what it 
can provide for your organization:
 
✓ Application design: Requires that you know exactly what maps, graph-
ics, and other decision-support products you want the software to 
produce for you. The system designer typically conducts interviews to 
determine what the specific information products are that might result 
from the implementation of GIS. Good designers often reverse-engineer 

311
 Chapter 20: GIS in Organizations
your organization to define your application needs. So, they have to 
identify your current goals and products, and determine how GIS might 
be able to enhance your operations, instill efficiency, and develop 
better products.
 
 Make getting your existing products set up for GIS automation prior-
ity number one. When your organization figures out more about the 
capabilities of GIS, you begin asking the system to do more. When your 
needs increase, ask your vendors to help you respond to them.
 
✓ Analytical model design: Know what analytical techniques you need 
your GIS to perform. These techniques differ for ecological, economic, 
military, and any other type of analysis. System designers use their 
knowledge of the GIS capabilities to guide you through the maze of pos-
sibilities.
 
✓ Database design: Various software packages use different data models. 
The application design needs and the analytical model needs you define 
for your GIS work together to determine your database needs. A thor-
ough database design involves everything from formatting and gather-
ing data to devising a complete plan for creating and maintaining your 
GIS database.
 
✓ Institutional/system design: When you implement GIS, you need to 
consider the people in an organization. You need to answer ques-
tions regarding personnel, equipment, space, organizational structure, 
enterprise-wide goals and objectives, and costs and benefits. Costs and 
benefits, in particular, often determine whether a GIS is even viable.
Most organizations conduct the process of needs assessment with the assis-
tance of outside GIS design consultants. If you already know which software 
you want to use, these companies can provide design consultants. Many 
organizations just starting out with GIS prefer to have a system developed 
from the ground up so that the design document they receive allows them to 
create an RFP (request for proposals), which gets GIS companies to beg for 
your business. Using a design document in an RFP often gets you the system 
that’s right for you, rather than the one that some GIS firm wants to sell you. 
(See Chapter 23 to find out what questions to ask GIS vendors.)
 
For some businesses, you can look at your competition to see what systems 
they use. They may not be forthcoming about the specifics, but the compa-
nies that serve them will be quick to let you know that they’re around.
Performing a cost/benefit analysis
You need to assess the costs and benefits of a GIS implementation if the 
GIS is designed to bring real financial benefits to the organization. Although 
organizations that don’t generate income from the implementation of GIS 
don’t use it as often, they might still be able to justify the expense because of 
other benefits, such as savings in time and improved product quality.

312
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
When you perform a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), you determine whether 
something has more benefit than expense, or vice versa. For example, if you 
invest $10,000 in something and it returns $16,000, you’ve netted $6,000 on 
your investment. Usually, you write this relationship as a ratio of the benefit 
divided by the cost. In this example, your ratio would be 1.6 to 1.
 
A common business practice is to look at the benefit-to-cost ratio for any large 
investment, including software tools like GIS. In some businesses I’ve worked 
with, a ratio of 1.6 to 1 would be a minimum standard needed to justify the 
expenditure.
Although a 1.6 to 1 ratio is good, a ratio of 2.2 to 1 (or even 3 to 1) is better. 
However, consider other institutional, intangible, or even non-economic 
considerations that can justify a 1.6 to 1 or even lower ratio. Such consider-
ations might include a desire to shift direction, improve worker satisfaction, 
or improve product quality. All these changes might prove important in the 
future.
 
When calculating economic benefits, remember that future benefits are less 
valuable than immediate benefits — in real dollars — because of inflation. For 
this reason, most applications of CBA employ an annually discounted rate, usu-
ally 7 percent. So, a benefit of $1,000 today will be worth only $930 next year.
Incorporating GIS into any organization often quickly incurs costs, but enjoy-
ing the benefits can take some time, which is one of the more difficult barri-
ers to its adoption. In most cases, the first year’s costs outweigh the benefits 
because the initial outlays involve staffing, planning, setup, automation, 
application development, and training. One pragmatic approach to CBA for 
GIS implementation is to use a six-year planning horizon. In the first year, 
your ratio might be 0.5 to 1, which means it cost you more than you made. 
Over the years, this ratio should improve. By year six, you should see ratios 
of 2.5 to 1 or better. Typically, a six-year average exceeds 1.6 to 1 if you 
design your GIS implementation well.
When performing CBA, you may have trouble defining the units of measure 
for both costs and benefits. You base your costs and benefits on the costs 
and financial benefits of the GIS products. Costs, often easier to determine 
than benefits, include hardware, data, software, application development, 
staffing, training, and maintenance. The benefits come in four groups:
 
✓ Direct: Improvements over the manual methods employed before GIS. 
Operational efficiencies often result from reducing staff, increasing staff 
productivity, and even reducing purchases of analog products.
 
✓ Agency: Increases in the company productivity and product quality.

313
 Chapter 20: GIS in Organizations
 
✓ Government: The benefits to government agencies other than the one 
actually implementing the GIS. This benefit also applies to partnerships 
that result in reduced costs or shared resources. Better, more timely 
products result in greater customer satisfaction and often increase 
sales.
 
✓ External: Improvements in the quality and quantity of external factors, 
perhaps including the impact of the products (for example, you may save 
a historic site as a result of the output of GIS), improved public perception 
of your company (the good-neighbor effect), and the regional benefits of 
increased tourism. These external benefits may be harder to quantify but 
often have a lasting, long-term positive effect on your company.
Understanding initial versus 
ongoing analysis
Organizations often consider GIS design when thinking about a new operation 
or implementation other than what was originally intended. During this con-
sideration period, have systems analysts review your needs; perform all the 
necessary cost-benefit analyses; and make initial staffing, education, hard-
ware, software, and all the other recommendations to ensure you’re headed 
in the right direction.
But GIS operations already under way, even those that you design well from 
the start, can benefit from periodic review and remediation. Systems design-
ers are trained to detect the effects of changes that might reduce the poten-
tial of your GIS, keeping it from operating at peak efficiency.
Using Change Detection
You can prevent the slow decay in GIS functionality by putting in place a 
good system of change detection. Change really is the only constant in the 
universe — and with the rapid advances in technology, change is only going 
to happen faster. Most business models assume that the organization is 
dynamic and subject to change. Hardware, software, and operating systems 
often change most quickly. But organizations also change. The following sec-
tions describe the two major types of change that you need to monitor and 
adjust to.

314
Part V: GIS Output and Application 
Technological change
Computer technology has undergone massive changes — from mainframes 
to minicomputers to PCs. The operating systems that control the machines 
also affect the GIS software, the supporting software (such as controllers), 
and third-party software used to support your GIS operations. You need to be 
aware of the changes so that you can react to them. And you need to balance 
the cost of acquiring new technology versus the cost of maintaining technol-
ogy that’s obsolete and no longer supported by new versions of the software.
Institutional change
Institutional change can be steady and constant, but factors such as com-
pany mergers, new management, new product needs, and new priorities may 
occur suddenly and without warning. Any of these circumstances warrant 
periodic systems review.
 
Here are a few tips to help you detect and manage change in your organization:
 
✓ Create an enterprise plan. The surest way to know the GIS’s overall 
benefits to the organization is to see where it fits in the overall goals 
and objectives. Although GIS is often a portion of a larger organization, 
having a system-wide plan allows you to identify where GIS most ben-
efits the organization, regardless of how it changes.
 
✓ Review the product line. Change almost always results in new products 
and the abandonment of older, obsolete products. Make sure that you 
review the priorities of the GIS products periodically and make adjust-
ments, as needed.
 
✓ Acquire technology. Besides ensuring that you have adequate technology 
at the beginning of any GIS operation, you need to establish a steady flow 
of acquisition, ensuring that you can jettison obsolete technology and 
always stay current with industry standards in hardware and software.
 
✓ Keep management apprised of changes. Upper-level management gen-
erally doesn’t have an “in the trenches” view of changes in personnel, 
training, computer hardware, or software. To guarantee that your orga-
nization meets data, software, training and other needs, management 
must be constantly aware of these needs. You absolutely must establish 
methods of communicating to management the organization’s changing 
needs and the associated resources necessary to meet those needs.
 
✓ Continue to review your plan. Besides looking at the enterprise-wide 
goals and objectives, you really need to reconsider the status of your 
original plan. Identify which parts of the plan are working smoothly 
and which need adjustment. You may want to have an outside systems 
designer take a look at your operation from time to time because GIS 
design professionals are trained to detect subtle changes you might miss.

n some ways, GIS is like a smorgasbord with lots of 
choices. In this Part of Tens, I offer you a sort of menu 
that helps you choose among the GIS software packages 
with different capabilities and price ranges. You’ll also 
want someone to serve you, so I provide you with a list of

G
IS software vendors are as varied as the data you encounter inside 
the software. These vendors range from companies that specialize 
in industry-specific software (such as Surfer for terrain analysis and 
CrimeStat for crime analysis), to more generic software companies (such as 
Environmental Systems Research Institute, Intergraph, and GE Smallworld). 
With the list of GIS software vendors tipping the scales at “a whole lot” and 
growing, you may find having a list of ten well-known vendors helpful. For 
an updated, comprehensive list of GIS vendors, see www.geog.ubc.ca/
courses/klink/resources/gis_vendors.html.
 
Each of the vendors listed in this chapter has a loyal client base, so it doesn’t 
hurt to ask folks who use each company for guidance when you’re choosing 
the company that’s right for you. Most GIS users are more than happy to talk 
about their experiences.
Environmental Systems 
Research Institute

Chapter 22
Ten Questions to Ask 
Potential Vendors
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the right vendor for your needs
▶ Understanding the products and services that vendors provide
F
inding a vendor that meets — and even exceeds — your needs is critical 
to ensuring your success when working with GIS. In order to find that 
vendor, you need to know what questions to ask. This chapter provides a 
good starting point for your decision-making process. Whatever you do, don’t 
rush your decision.
What Services Do You Offer?
Your first questions for a vendor should be based on your needs. Figure 
out what you require for output (called Spatial Information Products). Your 
output requirements give you an idea of the software capabilities, data struc-
tures (for example, raster or vector), and analytical capabilities that you 
need. Also, determine what, beyond the software, you’ll need from the com-
pany. Do you need consulting, implementation and setup, training, complete 
solutions, individualized services, or data?
 
Ask yourself what you currently use the GIS for in your organization so you 
can be sure the software meets those immediate needs.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Can You Show How Your Product 
Will Meet My Needs?
Among the most powerful methods of evaluating the utility, quality, and 
reliability of a vendor is to view examples of products and services that it 
provided to other clients. Reputable companies provide examples from their 
own portfolios, as well as the names and contact information of past clients.
 
You might want to ask the potential vendor to provide several names of satis-
fied and dissatisfied clients. A large amount of resistance to supplying this 
information tells you something about the vendor’s lack of confidence in its 
products and services.
What Data Formats Does 
Your Product Support?
Of the many different spatial data formats, some are standard and readily 
available, but others are proprietary. If you know your data format needs, 
include them in any request for proposals. Of course, you probably know 
some — but not all — necessary data formats, so ask the vendor for a com-
plete list of data formats that it can either provide or can convert to and 
from. You don’t necessarily want to go with the largest list because that list 
may not include important formats. Ask the vendor to provide not just a list 
of formats, but some descriptive information regarding what those formats 
are and who created them.
How Do You Handle Communications 
and Change Requests?
Projects aren’t static. While your needs and expectations change, you want 
a vendor who can adapt to your changing needs. So, make sure that you can 
have constant communication with the vendor. Ask who will communicate 
with you, how he or she will communicate, and how often.
 
The more dynamic your operation, the more you need the assurance of com-
munication. Establish this communication protocol right from the start to 
avoid any misunderstandings.

331
 Chapter 22: Ten Questions to Ask Potential Vendors
What Hardware Expertise Do You Have?
Your computer and its operating system are the lifeblood of your GIS. 
Additionally, you need peripherals such as monitors, input devices, plotters, 
printers, and even components such as storage and memory. A vendor that 
has expertise in finding solutions for a wide variety of hardware configurations 
provides yet another level of security and reliability for your GIS operations.
Ask the potential vendor for specific services and expertise regarding differ-
ent platforms, operating systems, and peripherals under differing implemen-
tation circumstances. If, for example, you need to use your GIS in hazardous 
environments, you might ask about what hardened equipment (equipment 
that can withstand rough treatment encountered in field or even battlefield 
conditions) you might need.
What Does the Price Include?
You absolutely need to know exactly what you get from the vendor for the 
price you pay. If, for example, the vendor fails to include all the GIS parts and 
services when bidding the job, who’s going to pay for any cost overruns that 
may occur? Does the price include hardware, software, installation, database 
development, upgrades, technical support, or other services?
How Long Until the System 
Is Operational?
If your tasks are time-critical, be very specific about when you need final 
delivery of the product. More importantly, perhaps, you want to know when 
the system will be fully implemented and operational. Just because the hard-
ware and software are in place doesn’t mean that you’re ready to use them. 
You may need to go through training and data conversion, or even module 
creation and testing, which require additional time. Ask for a schedule of 
progress reports, as well as some formal agreed-upon procedures if the 
vendor doesn’t complete the project on time.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
What Happens If the System Crashes?
Every system occasionally experiences software crashes or hardware fail-
ures. Most GIS vendors have some form of maintenance contract. Be sure to 
evaluate the vendor’s specific responsibilities if you experience software or 
hardware issues. Can the vendor provide on-site assistance, or phone and/or 
Internet support? Whether the vendor provides hardware support, as well as 
software support, may dictate the type of maintenance contracts it offers.
What Are Your Quality-Control 
Procedures?
Quality control is vital at all stages of the GIS life cycle. Find out whether the 
vendor has an existing set of quality-control procedures that ensures you get 
the product you need in the time required.
 
Good companies have written quality-control procedures. Ask to see a copy of 
these procedures. You may also want to ask who’s in charge of those proce-
dures and get that person or department’s complete contact information.
What Are Your Performance Guarantees?
While your GIS activities progress, you’re almost surely going to encounter 
shortcomings and mishaps along the way. Because you’ll be signing a writ-
ten contract with the vendor you choose, ask each vendor about its policy 
regarding restitution or solutions if the GIS or consulting services don’t meet 
your expectations. Good GIS vendors want to build a continuing relationship 
with their clients so they can continue to do business with them. To keep you 
in their client base, they usually do their best to make you happy.
Find out what a vendor would do under certain circumstances, for example, 
how it handles a request for changes in contracts as your organization grows 
or a request for rapid response for technical help during critical times in 
a project. If the vendor is reputable, it may have real-life stories that it can 
relate to your questions, demonstrating both its professionalism and its good 
faith.

Chapter 23
Ten GIS Data Sources
In This Chapter
▶ Getting data from government sources
▶ Exploring clearinghouses
▶ Finding commercial sources
T
he driving force behind all GIS analysis is data. GIS data come in many 
forms, from many sources, for many uses, with many scales and levels of 
accuracy, in different datums and projections, and at a huge variety of prices. 
Depending on your application and your specific needs, you may want to 
develop your own datasets. Developing your own datasets allows you to have 
total control over the content and accuracy, not to mention the ownership, 
of your data. Industry experts have claimed that data conversion (creating 
digital databases) often accounted for as much as 60 percent of the cost of 
system development. Large operations faced an enormous cost. Although 
these percentages have decreased over the years, they are still a substantial 
portion of the cost of operating a GIS. And so you might want to examine the 
possibility of obtaining datasets that already exist.
 
The sections in this chapter give you an overview of some handy GIS data 
sources, and Table 23-1 outlines their important features. While you’re evalu-
ating sources, here are some questions that you can ask yourself to help you 
determine which tool you want to use:
 
✓ Does your GIS have metadata management tools?
 
✓ Do you need a tool that supports content standards (specifically the 
Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, or CSDGM)?
 
✓ Do you need document data resource beyond what your GIS does?
 
✓ Do you need a distributable tool for your partners?
 
✓ What features are most important to you? For example, you may con-
sider auto-capture of information, bundling metadata with data, creation 
and use of templates, user interface, or robust help menus and tutorials 
important features.

National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse
A direct outcome of the United States’ Federal Geographic Data Committee’s 
(FGDC) collaborative activity was the establishment of a group of about 
250 cooperating government bodies in the United States called the National 
Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (NGDC). Organizations must apply for mem-
bership in the network and satisfy the FGDC standards to belong. The EROS 
Data Center (a USGS-run geospatial data facility) and the FGDC host the clear-
inghouse data.
The NGDC provides well-organized and complete metadata. You can easily 
access that metadata — but NGDC doesn’t commonly offer additional tools.
You can choose from several user interfaces to search for data to download. 
One really nice feature of this interface is the search wizard that allows you to 
search for geospatial data by category, as shown in Figure 23-1. After you select 
the category of data that you’re looking for, you can narrow the search by 
selecting a state from a drop-down menu, graphically choosing an area on the 
search window, or defining the latitude and longitude extent (see Figure 23-2).

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
A cautionary note
Not all GIS data are created equal. Commercial 
firms sometimes package data that you can 
find for free or at a minimal reproduction fee 
elsewhere, claiming that the data they offer 
are value-added data. Calling something value-
added implies that the company is justified in 
charging for these products because it has 
modified the data in some way beyond their 
original form.
But you need to determine whether the added 
value warrants the added cost. The companies 
may claim that they improved the data’s quality, 
packaged them specifically for your application, 
or actually added some attributes to the data 
that make the data considerably different than 
their raw, unmodified form. Some modifications 
actually degrade the original data. In some 
cases, a company really does add necessary 
attributes, package the data with your specific 
application in mind, and provide additional ser-
vices that make the data much more adaptable 
to your organization. So, you just need to decide 
whether these changes really add value to the 
data for you.
Here are some guidelines that I like to use to help 
me decide whether to buy value-added data:
 ✓ Ask for complete metadata. You can use the 
metadata to determine the original source 
of the data and how they were modified, as 
well as get an indication of the quality of the 
data. If the company isn’t forthcoming with 
metadata, walk away.
 ✓ Ask for a list of clients. Get contact infor-
mation for clients who have purchased 
similar value-added data from the data 
provider, including both happy and not-so-
happy clients.
 ✓ Talk to some GIS professionals and ask 
their advice. Many universities have GIS 
faculty who know about alternate data 
sources or lower-cost data, or they may be 
able to advise you about the possible value 
of value-added data. Also, go to user group 
blogs and lists online to find additional 
insights about each data provider and the 
quality of its products.
 ✓ Get a contract. Make sure it includes a 
guarantee that the data aren’t already 
available free or at minimal cost in essen-
tially the same quality and format that the 
vendor is offering. The contract should 
include a statement that explicitly indicates 
the value that the company added to exist-
ing data, especially public-domain data.
 ✓ Resist expediency. You might find the idea 
of purchasing data that you can obtain 
quickly very attractive, with the promise 
of getting your GIS up and running in no 
time. But remember that the value of your 
GIS operation lies fundamentally on the 
quality of your data. If you get poor-quality 
data quickly, the time it takes to clean up 
the mess can ultimately cost you more than 
taking the time to obtain quality data.
