About the Authors
William R. Rassman, M.D. is a professional inventor with more than
two dozen issued or pending patents in a wide range of fields includ-
ing medical devices, computer software, and biotechnology instru-
mentation. He introduced the modern standards of care for hair
transplantation, pioneered follicular unit hair transplantation, follic-
ular unit extraction, and hair transplant repair, publishing these
techniques in prestigious medical journals with Dr. Bernstein. He
received the Golden Follicle Award for his contributions to the clini-
cal practice of hair restoration. Dr. Rassman has been featured on
TV media events such as ABC’s Extreme Makeover and programs on
the Discovery Channel, the BBC, and many others. Throughout his
career, Dr. Rassman’s goal has been to make a difference, and among
his most notable accomplishments is his pioneering work develop-
ing and commercializing the intra-aortic pump, today’s standard of
care heart pump found in almost every cardiac care unit in the
world. Today Dr. Rassman’s focus is on his hair transplant practice
and the balding blog www.baldlingblog.com, now the largest hair
loss Web site in the world. You can find out more about his practice
at his Web site, www.newhair.com, and by calling 1-800-NewHair.
Jae P. Pak, M.D. graduated from the University of California, Irvine,
with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace and Mechanical
Engineering. He then took a brief detour with the U.S. Marine Corp
Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia, to pursue his love of
aviation. As an engineer, he designed fiber optic illuminators and
lighting systems that are used all over the world. Some of his engi-
neering work can be seen on the skyline of Las Vegas and stealth
ships operated by the U.S. Navy. Eventually Dr. Pak went on to com-
plete his medical training at the Medical College of Virginia. His inter-
est in medicine crossed paths with Dr. William Rassman’s interest in
engineering in 1997. Since then, the two have been pioneering hair
transplant methods, automation, and instrumentation from the initial
follicular unit extraction (FUE) techniques and tools to Hair Implanting
Pen devices that are routinely used in his practice. He has collabo-
rated on U.S. Patents with Dr. Rassman and has been intimately
involved with innovative hair transplant surgical techniques incor-
porating new technology. Dr. Pak is also an avid artist and painter,
which serves him well in the aesthetics of hair restoration. Dr. Pak
continues to develop new surgical techniques and invent surgical
instrumentation to further advance the field of hair transplant
surgery with Dr. Rassman at the New Hair Institute in Los Angeles.

Eric Schweiger, M.D. is Clinical Instructor of Dermatology at the
Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. He practices cosmetic
and general dermatology with a particular focus on hair loss and its
treatment. Dr. Schweiger has served as the primary investigator in
clinical research studies involving lasers and light-based treatment,
and he has authored numerous articles in peer-reviewed medical
journals. Dr. Schweiger received his undergraduate degree from the
University of Michigan and his doctor of medicine from the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York . He completed his intern-
ship in internal medicine at NYU Medical Center and his dermatol-
ogy residency at the University of Kansas. You can find out more
about his practice at www.bernsteinmedical.com.
Robert M. Bernstein, M.D. is Clinical Professor of Dermatology at
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University in New
York. He’s recognized worldwide for his pioneering work in follicu-
lar unit hair transplantation, follicular unit extraction, and hair
transplant repair. Dr. Bernstein has been chosen as one of New York
Magazine’s “Best Doctors in New York” for eight consecutive years,
and he’s a recipient of the Platinum Follicle Award for his achieve-
ments in surgical hair restoration. Dr. Bernstein has been featured
on Good Morning America, the Today show, and the Discovery
Channel. He has appeared on The Early Show, CBS News, Fox News,
National Public Radio, and in GQ Magazine, Men’s Health, and
Vogue. Dr. Bernstein’s Center for Hair Restoration in Manhattan is
devoted to the treatment of hair loss using pioneering state-of-the-
art hair transplant techniques. You can find out more about his
practice at his Web site, www.bernsteinmedical.com, and by
calling 212-826-2400.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
The authors have written numerous scientific articles and textbook
chapters for the medical field, but writing a succinct reference book
for a wide audience is a uniquely different challenge and in many
ways far more difficult. We could never have accomplished this task
without the help of our experienced editors Sharon Perkins and Tracy
Brown Collins (who are anything but Dummies). We’re very grateful
for their professionalism and hard work in bringing this book to press.
As hair transplant surgeons, writing about the technical elements of
the surgical process was easier than tackling some of the other sub-
jects that fell outside our area of expertise. We want to thank Douglas
Hong, who had the insight to point us in the direction to write this
book; Dr. Norman Estrin, for his help in explaining issues related to
the FDA as well as hair care; and Bret Katz and David Ahdoot of DD
Chemco, for giving us very important insights into the fine nuances of
the chemicals and ingredients found in various commercial products.
Although there are many people we can acknowledge who helped
educate us in the fields of hair and hair restoration, Dr. Richard
Shiell stands out because he freely gave us insights from his
decades of experience working through the various hair technolo-
gies. Also, there are many staff members who have worked tire-
lessly with us in surgery as part of our teams, hour after hour and
day after day, and we wish to acknowledge them as a group.
We want to thank our patients for the faith they put in us as physi-
cians and surgeons. As we were at the forefront of a new hair trans-
plant paradigm, we were fortunate that many of our patients were
able to understand this vision and share in its development. We
became partners in their surgical care and in the evolution of this
exciting new field of hair restoration.

Introduction
H
air loss—what’s the big deal? Everyone loses their hair 
eventually, right? No point in worrying about it—or buying a
book about it. For that matter, how much is there to say about hair
loss anyway? And isn’t it rather vain to worry about hair loss when
world peace still hasn’t been achieved?
While we’d be the last to argue that world peace should take a
back seat to your hair loss, we think there’s plenty to say about
losing your hair—which is why we’ve written this book. We also
think that losing your hair can be a crushing blow to your self-
esteem, and can affect your social life, work performance and view
of yourself. 
The good news is there are things you can do to minimize or 
prevent hair loss, and ways to obtain a whole new head of hair, if
you decide to go that route. It may help you to realize the scope of
the hair loss problem by considering the following statistics:
 Around fifty percent of men suffer from some degree of male
pattern baldness by age fifty
 Around twenty million women have significant hair loss at
some point in their lives
 Millions of men have taken prescription medications to pre-
vent or decrease hair loss
 Approximately 100,000 men have hair transplants every year
Whether you already have significant hair loss, or are just sizing up
the other members of your family and fearing that hair loss is in
your future, this book will help you face your concerns and weigh
your options in the most practical way possible.
About This Book
The goal of this book is to make you more aware of the options 
you have if you’re suffering from hair loss, and to make you more
comfortable pursuing those options. Whether you choose to take
medication, buy a hairpiece, or go directly to hair transplantation,
we want you to be an educated and confident consumer.

We also want you to understand hair: what it is, why it reacts the
way it does to the abuse most of us heap on it, and how best to
preserve its appearance.
This book is for you if you’re concerned about future hair loss or
already in the throes of it, or if you know someone who is. You’ll
learn more here than you ever wanted to know about diseases that
cause hair loss, the medications and over the counter options that
promote hair growth, how hair transplants are performed, how to
choose a good surgeon, and the way hairpieces are made, if you
choose to read the whole book.
On the other hand, if you just need quick info on what to expect
after hair transplant, or which medications work best, a quick look
in the appropriate chapter will give you that info.
Conventions Used in This Book
Every book follows certain styling rules to make it easier for you to
find information. In this book, we put important words that we
define in the glossary at the end of the book in italics. We also put
key words in bold type so they stand out and catch your attention.
We place all Web addresses in monofont to set them apart. During
printing of this book, some of the Web addresses may have broken
across two lines of text. If you come across such an address, rest
assured that we haven’t put in any extra characters (such as
hyphens) to indicate the break. When using a broken Web address,
type in exactly what you see on the page, pretending that the line
break doesn’t exist.
This book contains sidebars, which are shaded in gray, that con-
tain interesting or fun information, or personal stories about our
experiences in the hair loss field. You don’t have to read them to
understand the principals of hair loss and replacement, but hope-
fully you’ll enjoy reading them when you have time.
What You’re Not to Read
Feel free to skip the copyright material, unless you’re the sort who
has to read everything. You can also skip sidebars, the gray boxed
material that contains mostly personal stories which are
immensely interesting (and often amusing) but not essential for
your knowledge of hair replacement.
You may also want to skip areas marked with the icon Technical
Stuff if technical things aren’t your strong suit.

Foolish Assumptions
This book is for everyone concerned about their hair in any way,
shape or form—if you want healthier hair, more hair, or replace-
ment hair, this book is for you. More specifically, you should read
this book if:
 You know male pattern baldness runs in your family
 You already have some hair loss and want to know how to
slow or stop it
 You’re thinking about taking medication—prescription or over
the counter—to slow hair loss
 You want to conceal your hair loss as long as you can and do
not know how to do this
 You want to buy a hairpiece but don’t know where to start
 You’re considering a hair transplant and need more 
information
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into six parts. Each part addresses different
aspects of hair loss and hair replacement. This organization makes
it easy to find the topic you’re looking for. Here’s a quick overview
of what you can find in each part.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair
The better you know your hair, the better you’ll be able to care for
it. This section teaches you all about hair—what it’s made from,
how it grows, and how best to care for it. This part covers every-
thing from the intimate inner workings of a hair follicle to choosing
the right shampoo for your hair.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: 
How and Why It Happens
In this part, we look at all the different reasons for hair loss, with a
detailed look at the most common cause of baldness, male pattern
baldness. We also examine the many different diseases and health
issues that can cause temporary or permanent hair loss.
Introduction

Part III: Creative Techniques 
for Concealing Hair Loss
When you’re looking to conceal your hair loss, this is the section
to read. We describe the temporary methods of hair loss conceal-
ment such as sprays, as well as hair systems such as toupees,
wigs, extensions and weaves. We also give you a complete course
in how hair systems are created, how to tell a good hair systems
from a bad one, and how to buy quality when you are shopping for
a hair system.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, 
and Topical Therapies
In this part, we look into the medicine cabinet for hair loss 
remedies. We discuss the prescription medications for hair loss,
their benefits and limitations, and also look at over the counter
and alternative medicines that claim to slow or prevent hair loss.
We also describe the use of laser treatments in stimulating hair
growth, and tell you what works—and what to avoid.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss
Solutions
If a hair transplant is in your future, this is the part to read. Not
only do we tell you how to find the right surgeon, we also tell you
how to avoid the wrong ones. We also give you a detailed look into
the operating room, and follow you home to help you through the
weeks and months after your transplant.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every Dummies books contains a Part of Tens section; these are
short, pithy, often humorous chapters dealing with the topic at
hand. In the Part of Tens, we look at the FDA and the ways it
does—and doesn’t—protect you from charlatans in the hair
replacement field. We also look at the myths of hair loss, a few 
reasons why hair transplant may be your best bet in the long run,
and ten reasons why non surgical replacement may be better in
your case.

Icons Used in This Book
This book draws your attention to different types of information by
placing four icons in the margins of the text. These draw your
attention to bits of information we consider important in one of the
following ways:
When we think something is especially important, we mark it with
the Remember icon.
Information marked with the Tips icon enhances or simplifies your
life in some way.
Pay attention to Warning icons; the information they contain is
essential to maintaining your hair—or your health.  If we think the
information deserves a Warning icon—make sure your read it—
and follow our advice!
This book contains a lot of technical information about your hair;
while all the info under the Technical icons is interesting and
important from a scientific viewpoint, it’s not required reading if
you’re not interested in a lot of scientific or medical detail about
hair loss.
Where to Go from Here
As with all Dummies books, this book is set up so you can go to
whatever section interests you, read just that section, and come
away with all the info you need. Of course, we hope you’ll read the
whole book, because we feel it contains valuable info, but don’t
feel like you have to read it all at once or in any particular order.
If you want to delve deeper into hair replacement issues, we’ve
included an appendix at the end of the book which lists sources for
more information, as well as for support groups, if you’re the type
who likes to join organizations.

Part I
Getting to Know
Your Hair

In this part . . . 
W
hat is hair, exactly? This part answers all your
burning questions about hair: what it’s made of,
how it grows, and how you should take care of it so that it
will last a lifetime — or at least as long your genetic
makeup allows it to hang around.

Chapter 1
All About Hair and Hair Loss
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your hair and why you have it
 Acknowledging causes and the personal impact of hair loss
 Considering temporary and permanent solutions
 Looking forward to future developments in the field
You may wonder how we can write an entire book on the topic
of hair loss. You may think hair loss is an incurable condition,
so what is there to say about it? But hair loss doesn’t have to be
inevitable, even if your whole family is balding or thinning. You can
take steps to slow hair loss and replace the hair you’ve lost.
In this chapter, we introduce some facts about hair loss, including
who may experience it and, best of all, what your options are when
you start to feel air on the top of your head.
Who Cares About Hair? Everyone!
Even people who don’t pay much attention to their hair care when
it starts to thin or fall out. You may feel somewhat betrayed: You’ve
been kind to your hair, bought expensive shampoos, and kept up
with regular maintenance, and this is how it rewards you — by
falling out?
We take our youth and our hair for granted as long as we have
them. Then, certain things happen as we age — we sag, gain
weight, lose muscle tone — and we may not like them, but we
know we could fix them by exercise, diet, and lifestyle changes —
not that we will, necessarily, but we feel we could if we wanted to.
In other words, we still feel like we have control. 
And then there’s hair. At least every month, in the case of most
men, we face our hair in the mirror at the hair salon, where for
some reason the situation always looks more dire than it does 
at home.

“Is there as much hair there today as last month?” you ask your-
self. “That hair in the sink, in my shower drain, on my brush. Am I
going bald?” As your hair starts to disappear, you feel helpless
because you’re at the mercy of your hair; you can’t control its fall-
out any more than you can control the weather. To a young man of
twenty-one a receding hairline can seem like the end of the world. 
Is it really hopeless? Of course not! If you’re just starting to lose
your hair, there are many things you can do to slow its loss; if
you’re bald already, there are still options to replace your hair or
cover up your bald pate. This book will help you, no matter what
stage your hair loss is in. 
Hair 101: What exactly is hair?
Most people have no idea what really lurks beneath their hair,
unless they’ve been shaving it off already.
For something that you play with, obsess over, color, cut, and twist
into odd shapes, hair is surprisingly dead. Yes, the hair you think
looks so vibrant and alive is actually not alive at all. I’m not saying
that you should ignore or mistreat your hair. For something that’s
dead, hair is quite capable of responding to good treatment or bad.
Hair is technically part of your skin, although like fingernails and
toenails, it grows and separates from your skin. The average head
contains around 100,000 hair follicles, and your entire body is
home to around 5 million hair follicles. Most of the complex activ-
ity that keeps your hair growing goes on below the surface.
The active growth phase of a hair follicle, called the anagen phase,
averages around three years. At any given time, about 90 percent
of your hair is in the anagen phase, and the other 10 percent is
taking a rest in the telogen phase, which is the resting phase, and
disappears from your head.
Hair grows about  1⁄2 inch a month (although it certainly seems like
more when you need a haircut!) and grows to a length of 11⁄2 to 3
feet before growth stops and the hair falls out. (In Chapter 2, we
tell you all you ever wanted to know about hair, right down to its
roots.)
Hair 102: Why do we have hair?
Hair is more than just a pretty cover up. It serves many biological
functions and actually covers most of your body (often growing in
places you’d rather it didn’t).
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
10

The functions of hair (both on your head and elsewhere on your
body) are that
 It protects your head.
 It keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
 It protects you against sunburn.
 It has nerve endings that serve to make a scalp massage feel
good, yet tell you when a mosquito has landed on your arm to
bite you.
Hair and ethnicity: How race
impacts hair
What your hair looks like is directly related to the genes you
received from your parents. There are some hair generalities
related to different racial groups, although your individual hair
traits will vary. Many people’s gene pool today is pretty diverse!
(See Chapter 2 for much more about hair and ethnicity.)
However, the following generalities apply:
 Although it appears that many Caucasians have thinner hair
than other ethnicities, Caucasians actually have the highest
number of hairs on their heads, an average of two hundred
hairs per square centimeter.
 Asians have the thickest and coarsest hair, which makes it
appear as though they have more hairs on their head. They
average a hundred and fifty hairs per square centimeter.
 African Americans have the thinnest and the finest hair, but
because it mats together more than Caucasian or Asian hair, it
appears thicker. African hair averages a hundred and thirty
hairs per square centimeter. 
You’re Not Alone: Dealing 
with Causes of Hair Loss 
and the Personal Impact
When you’re going bald, you may feel like you’re the only one. It
seems like every commercial on television features hair wafting
gently in the breeze as tanned youngsters run across the beach;
Chapter 1: All About Hair and Hair Loss 11

you may not have the tan or the body, but those are at least theo-
retically obtainable, whereas lost hair seems to be just that — lost
youth forever.
You’re not alone, though; hair loss affects over 50 million people in
the United States alone, and lest you think only men have hair loss
issues, over 20 million of sufferers are women. So it’s a safe bet
that thousands of people are thinking the same thing you are: “I
can’t believe I’m going bald.”
The many possible causes 
of hair loss
Everyone loses around 100 hairs from their head every day, but
serious hair loss isn’t a “one cause fits all” type of problem; many
factors contribute to hair loss, and we give you the full rundown
in Chapters 4 and 5. The most common causes of hair loss are
listed here.
 Genetics: Yes, you knew it all along: It’s Mom’s (or Dad’s) fault
that you have no hair. The overwhelming majority (up to 98
percent) of men with balding fall into the genetic category.
Female genetic balding occurs much less frequently, but up to
50 percent of women have hair loss related to their inherited
genes. (See Chapter 4 for more on genetics and hair loss.) 
The good news is that only seven percent of men develop the
most advanced balding pattern (left with just a 3 inch wreath
of hair around the side and back of the head). If you’ve inher-
ited this pattern, it’s usually evident by the time you’re 30.
Genetic hair loss in men generally falls into one of several 
distinct hair loss patterns identified under the Norwood class-
ification system (see Chapter 4). In balding men, the hair
around the sides of the head almost always retains a normal,
thick appearance. In women, genetic hair loss is different; for
one thing, it tends to occur as overall hair thinning (including
the sides of the head) rather than loss of hair on certain areas
of the head.
 Diseases: A number of diseases as well as hormonal influ-
ences, including thyroid disease and anemia, cause hair loss.
Autoimmune disease also can cause patchy hair loss. We
cover these causes in Chapter 5.
 Mechanical causes: Mechanical hair loss is caused by exter-
nal forces such as tight braiding, rubber banding, turbans, 
or other hair torture devices that put stress and strain on
your hair.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
12

 Stress: In some cases, stress can contribute to hair loss in
those who are genetically predisposed to it or can result in a
sudden loss of hair in a condition called telogen effluvium
(read all about it in Chapter 5).
 Medications: Many medicines, most notably anabolic
steroids, birth control pills, antidepressants, and tranquiliz-
ers, can cause hair loss. (See Chapter 5 for a complete list).
Society’s emphasis on hair
“So what if you’re going bald — it’s only hair!” Statements like that
can make your blood boil when you first start losing your hair.
Most people are cavalier about hair loss when they’re not the ones
losing it and are unsympathetic to the plight of the victims of hair
loss, but when their hair starts falling out, they’ll be looking for
miracle cures, too — you can be sure of it.
Hair loss isn’t life threatening, but it can be an extreme threat to
self-esteem. Studies show that hair loss can lead to feelings of
shame, depression, frustration, helplessness, and anger. It also can
result in feelings of sexual inadequacy and loss of self confidence.
Today, hair is something of a status symbol; you can find thou-
sands of products devoted to hair care, which only emphasize the
problem for those experiencing hair loss. Many men now have
their hair styled rather than just getting it cut at a local barber
shop. Television gives the impression that a full head of luxurious
hair is the norm, implying that those who are losing it are some-
how abnormal.
Hair is also used as a method of self expression, a way to say who
you are. A “bad hair day” can ruin your week; a “no hair life” can
derail your career, your love life, and your self-esteem, but so can
anything, if you let it.
Before you can fix a problem, you have to realize you have a 
problem. Denial is your enemy; you can’t fix what you can’t admit.
This book will teach you what you need to know about keeping
your hair before you lose it or getting it back if you waited too
long. The good news is that there are solutions to hair loss, no
matter where you are in the hair loss process. 
Chapter 1: All About Hair and Hair Loss 13

Why men worry about 
losing their hair 
Twenty-five percent of men will show signs of balding by age 30 and
50 percent by the time they’re 50. While women can rearrange their
hair to help disguise hair loss or resort to extensions or wigs, men
sometimes don’t have enough hair — or wear it long enough — to
utilize these options.
Studies have shown that self confidence levels both inside and out-
side of the workplace can be affected by hair loss, and that correct-
ing hair loss can have huge psychological and career benefits.
The devastation of hair 
loss in women
Women lose hair, but not in the same ways as men do. However,
severe hair loss can be even more devastating to women than it is
to men. Hair loss may be a serious blow to a woman’s self-esteem,
in large part because of cultural norms, society’s concept of femi-
ninity, and the expectation that a woman should have glossy, luxu-
rious, well-kept hair. We know that because the magazines women
read tell them just that. 
As much as half of the female population suffers from hair loss at
some time in their lives. Women’s hair loss tends to differ from
men’s hair loss both in cause and in the way the hair is affected.
Women’s hair loss is generally widespread, with thinning all over
the scalp rather than loss in certain areas; rarely do you see
women whose hair loss leaves them bald on top with a healthy
fringe around the edges like the typical look of male pattern 
baldness. In Chapter 4, we look at the unique challenges of hair
loss in women.
For women, thinning hair may be caused by a number of medical
conditions which, when treated, may restore their hair. This book
covers these issues in Chapter 6. 
Keeping Your Hair Healthy
In the process of caring for our hair, we do many damaging things
to it, from combing it the wrong way to coloring it with harsh
chemicals or subjecting it to strong sunlight.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
14

If you’re starting to lose your hair, it’s important to take the best
possible care of the hair you still have. Throughout this book, we
discuss the best ways to care for your hair, but here a few of the
worst things you can do to your hair. (See Chapter 3 for a full dis-
cussion of proper hair care).
 Never back comb your hair: It damages the hair shaft.
 Don’t rub your hair dry with a towel.
 Don’t over dry your hair with a blow dryer; stop before your
hair is completely dry.
 Select the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair type
(Chapter 3 tells you how).
Surveying Hair Replacement
Options
Whether you’re a man or a woman, losing your hair doesn’t mean
you have to present a bald head to the world; in most cases, your
options range from the simple, like plopping a department store
wig on your head, to the more complicated (and expensive), like
pricey hair systems or hair transplant surgery.
Minimizing or hiding hair loss
In a society used to chemical fixes and instant gratification, your
first response to falling hair may be to search the drugstore
shelves for a tonic that will replace lost hair — or at least preserve
what you still have. You want to believe that these tonics will do
the job and restore your head to its former glory. There are med-
ications that can help save your hair, but you may not want to
resort to medication, at least not just yet.
Chapter 3 gives you a wealth of information on taking care of your
hair because, although good hair care by itself can’t help you fight
genetic hair loss, it will keep your hair looking good while you still
have it. In cases where hair loss results from disease or mechanical
damage, good hair care can help you keep your hair as well as
keep it looking good.
In Chapter 8, we introduce some of the products that can work
with the hair you have left to give the illusion of fuller hair. It’s not
quite as simple as spraying silly string on the top of your head or
using a can of paint to color your bald spot, but today’s spray-on
or powdery products can definitely improve your hair’s appear-
ance for some time without looking weird.
Chapter 1: All About Hair and Hair Loss 15

Wearing a wig
When we say “wig,” we don’t mean the powdered version com-
monly worn in the 1700s — although if that’s your style, who’s to
stop you? In this book, we use the terms “wig” or “hair replace-
ment system” (hair systems for short) when we are referring 
to a hairpiece as a hair replacement option for men or women
(usually wigs for women and toupees for men, but the terminology
is flexible).
Wigs have improved tremendously over the last few decades, and a
good one is virtually undetectable. (Your hair stylist will know, but
he or she may be the only one.)
A wig can be a quick fix for temporary hair loss, such as the hair
loss from chemotherapy treatments, or it can be your lifetime 
solution to lost hair. Many women have several wigs and can
change from “Gee, you need a haircut” to a freshly trimmed look
overnight. Men may have many hair systems to wear in various
settings or situations.
You can buy an inexpensive wig for less than $100, but if you want
it to be foolproof, you probably have to spend more than that. A
good wig (or wigs) can easily run into the thousands, and it’s pos-
sible for the maintenance fees to rival those of your car or condo.
Turn to Part III for all the details on buying and caring for hair
replacement systems of all sorts.
Pharmaceutical, laser, and topical
treatments
If hair loss looks like it’s going to be a permanent part of your 
life, you may be ready to turn to prescription medications or 
treatments to minimize your losses. The good news is that treat-
ments are available to help slow hair loss caused by inherited 
male pattern baldness. (See Chapter 9 for a rundown of prescrip-
tion medications, Chapter 10 for a list of herbs that some people
swear by, as well as dietary recommendations for maintaining a
healthy scalp.)
For many women, hair loss may also respond to medication, or, if a
specific disease process is causing the loss, by addressing the
health issue. 
Anyone can have healthier hair by modifying their diets, but giving
you hair through medication is a bit more selective. Medications
have limitations and may only work on certain types of hair loss.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
16

They can be used in addition to surgical procedures, such as hair
transplant, to help slow continuing hair loss (yes, you still lose hair
after a transplant — not the transplanted hair, but hair in balding
areas) or to help you keep your hair as long as possible.
Zapping your head with lasers to help your hair grow may sound
like science fiction, but some laser treatments can do just that.
Chapter 11 has information on which laser treatments may help
and which ones will part you from your money without adding a
hair to your head.
Considering hair restoration surgery
Hair transplants were an option out of reach for many men until
fairly recently. With new advances in technology and better access
to well-trained surgeons who work with modern techniques, the
option of transplant is more accessible — and more men are taking
advantage of it. 
Around 100,000 American men have hair transplants every year,
and the results are truly remarkable. What’s most impressive is
that these men look so natural that not even their hairdresser will
know for sure! 
The difficulties of transplants in the past — the pluggy look —
have been largely overcome with better technologies and well-
trained surgeons. The main objection to a hair transplant is the
cost, which is why it’s vitally important that you pick a hair trans-
plant surgeon who will give you the most for your money in terms
of positive, long-lasting results.
Although the cost of a hair transplant can sound exorbitant at first
glance, it may not be as far out of your reach as you think. The fact
is that a hair transplant costs less than five years’ worth of buying
and maintaining one decent quality wig!
We devote Chapter 13 to advising you on how to choose a hair
transplant surgeon (price should never be your main considera-
tion!), take you through the transplant process, and go home with
you and your new hair in Chapter 14 to look at how life will be after
your transplant.

Looking at the Future of 
Hair Loss Prevention
The future of hair loss prevention is bright. Surgical procedures are
improving all the time (the transplant surgeon of tomorrow may be
a robot!), and new medications are being developed to slow or at
times reverse hair loss. Gene manipulation and hair cloning may
not be too far down the road to give you an unlimited amount of
hair to work with.
In the meantime, hair replacement systems are better looking than
ever, and more research has been done on hair care products and
treatments and ways to enhance the hair you have. Chapter 12
takes a look at what’s on the hair horizon and the techniques that
could make hair loss a thing of the past.

Splitting Hairs: Growth, Loss,
and Change over Time
In This Chapter
 Looking inside a hair follicle
 Feeling the difference: Comparing hair types
 Seeing how hair changes as you age
N
ot all hair is the same. Some people have thick, some thin;
some is beautifully blonde, some is a glossy black; some is
shiny, some is dull. Depending upon where hair is on your body,
some grows long and some short, some is straight and some curly.
Knowing more about the characteristics of hair and what type of
hair you have is particularly important when your hair thins and
falls out because coverage and the appearance of fullness in a bald-
ing person critically depends upon the characteristics of the hair
and skin color.
Although understanding some of the factors that contribute to hair
loss can’t necessarily help prevent the loss, understanding the fun-
damental relationships between hair and skin color, hair density,
bulk, and other characteristics can help you maximize the fullness
you can achieve as well as guide you in your replacement options.
In this chapter, we explain the parts of a single follicle and hair
shaft, how hair grows, the different hair types, what causes those
differences, and some factors that can slow its growth, including
age and ethnicity. We share all this with you to arm you with the
knowledge you need to assess your own hair situation and investi-
gate the options available to you to deal with it — whether you’re
thinking about replacement or transplantation or just creative 
hairstyling.

Under the Microscope: Hair 
and Scalp Anatomy
Hair is much more complex than it looks. In this section, we
describe how hair follicles grow and alter with time and other fac-
tors. Understanding how hair follicles function (and what makes
them stop functioning) can help you maintain them, thereby slow-
ing the hair loss process.
Going beneath the skin
Most people think of hair only in terms of what they see above the
scalp, but hair is actually a rather complex organ that goes
beneath the surface. Anatomically speaking, hair is part of your
skin. But because hair is physically distinct from skin, it’s referred
to as a skin appendage. (Other skin appendages include sweat
glands, fingernails, and toenails.) See Figure 2-1.
Skin is composed of three main layers:
 The epidermis: This outer layer of the skin is less than 1 mil-
limeter thick. It’s composed of dead cells that are in a con-
stant state of sloughing and replacement. As dead cells are
lost, new ones from the growing layer below replace them.
 The dermis: This tough layer of connective tissue is about 2
to 3 millimeters thick on the scalp. This layer gives the skin its
strength and contains both sebaceous (oil) glands and sweat
glands. 
Sebaceous glands produce an oily substance, which creates a
plug of wax (sebum) to cover the opening to the growing hair
follicle. As the hair grows upward from the skin surface, some
of the waxy substance is taken up by the hair shaft as a lubri-
cant, giving the hair a waxy sheen.
Sweat glands help control body temperature, particularly
when it’s hot. These glands produce a watery, salty sweat; as
the sweat evaporates, body heat is lost. 
 Subcutaneous fat and connective tissue: This layer contains
the larger sensory nerve branches and the blood vessels that
nourish the skin. In the scalp, the lower portions of the hair
follicles (called the bulbs) are found in the upper part of this
fatty layer.

Figure 2-1: The “hair organ” made up a hair follicle and all the structures that 
support it.
Dissecting a hair follicle
The hair follicle must function properly in order to maintain a
healthy head of hair. A hair follicle is a complex structure that
measures about 4 to 6 millimeters in length. Each follicle produces
one to four hair shafts, each about 0.1 millimeters in width (in
other words, these are really, really tiny structures).
The layers of a hair follicle
Hair follicles have three layers surrounding the strand of hair,
which you can see in Figure 2-2:
 The outer root sheath, or trichelemma: This is the outer
layer, which surrounds the follicle in the dermis and then
blends into the epidermis on the surface of the skin, forming
the pore from which the hair grows.

 The inner root sheath: This middle layer is composed of
three parts, with the cuticle being the innermost portion that
touches the strand of hair. The cuticle of the inner root sheath
interlocks with the hair cuticle (described in “the layers of the
hair shaft” section) to give it rigidity.
 The bulb: This is the lower portion of each hair follicle. It con-
tains the inner matrix cells, which produce bundles (also
called spindles) of hair cells that look like fine wires in an elec-
tric cord. These bundles are actually made up of even smaller
bundles, which literally twist as they’re made. The size of the
bulb and the number of matrix cells determine the width of
the fully grown hair.

The hair shaft is composed of three layers.

 The cortex: This middle layer comprises the bulk of the hair
shaft and is what gives hair its strength. It’s composed of an
organic protein called keratin, the same material that com-
prises rhinoceros horns and deer antlers.
 The medullas: This is the center, or core, of the hair shaft,
and it’s only present in terminal hair follicles (a fully grown
hair).
The dermal papillae
At the bottom of the hair follicle, there is a bulbous (bulb) portion
which contains a small collection of specialized cells called the
dermal papillae. Scientists believe these cells are at least partially
responsible for determining. how long the hair will eventually
grow, how thick it will be, and the character of the hair will be.
For many years, scientists thought that hair actually grew from the
dermal papillae. Recent evidence shows that the growth center is
not totally controlled from the dermal papillae. Elements that con-
trol hair growth can be found all the way up to the region of the fol-
licle where the sebaceous glands are attached.
If the dermal papillae is removed (which sometimes happens
during a hair transplant (see Chapter 13), the hair follicle may still
be able to regenerate new hair, although the new hair may not be a
characteristically healthy looking terminal hair. It may be shorter,
thinner, and more kinky or wavy. 
How hair grows
Hair doesn’t grow in individual strands but rather emerges from
the scalp in groups of one to four (and sometimes even five or six)
strands. Hair follicles are arranged in the skin in naturally occur-
ring groups called follicular units.
At any given time, about 90 percent of a person’s terminal hairs are
actively growing. This growth phase, called anagen, can last for
two to seven years, though the average is about three. Scalp hair
grows at an average rate of about 0.44 millimeters a day, or about 
1⁄2 inch per month.
The 10 percent of scalp hairs not actively growing are in a resting
state called telogen that, in a healthy scalp, lasts about three to five
months. When a hair enters its resting phase, growth stops, the
bulb detaches from the papilla, and the shaft is either pulled out
(as when combing one’s hair) or pushed out when the new shaft
starts to grow.
Chapter 2: Splitting Hairs: Growth, Loss, and Change over Time 23

Hairs grow in naturally growing groups of one to four hairs each.
These are called follicular units. The follicular unit has two types of
hair. The terminal hair and a vellus hair or two. These vellus hairs
are smaller, shorter, and finer than the terminal hairs found in the
follicular unit. 
When a hair falls out on its own, a small black bulb can often be
seen at the end of the hair. If it’s pulled out while it is in its growth
(anagen) phase, it will produce pain when it is pulled out and a
white, sticky mucus swelling will often be seen at the bottom of the
hair shaft. Most people assume that this is the growth center of the
hair and that pulling it out means the hair won’t grow again.
But cells of the dermal papillae and the growth centers found along
the side of the hair shaft near the sebaceous gland will remain in
the place after the hair is pulled out. These cells will multiply and
cause a new hair to grow at the same location in a month or so. So
pulling out a single hair should not kill that hair. 
Humans lose about 100 hairs per day. The presence of a much
larger number of hairs on your comb, in the sink, or in the tub can
be the first sign of excessive hair loss. We become sensitized by
balding in our family history and a thinning appearance on the
scalp. Although we may see hair in the drain often, if we are not
balding or thinning we might think nothing of it.

Letting down your hair
You’re probably familiar with the Grimm’s fairy tale about Rapunzel, a young maid
who was put into a high tower when she was a girl. One day, a prince heard her
crying and was smitten by her beauty and her long blonde braided hair. When he
couldn’t find a door into the tower to rescue her, he asked that she let down her
golden hair so he could climb up and rescue her. The beautiful Rapunzel let her hair
hang over the edge of the tower, and the prince scurried up to her rescue. After
some harrowing events, they lived happily ever after.
It’s a good story but, notwithstanding freakish exceptions (the current world record
hair length is more than 18 feet), clearly the Brothers Grimm weren’t well-versed in
the biology of normal hair growth. They couldn’t have known that the longest growth
phase of hair is growth was six or seven years, making Rapunzel’s hair a maximum
of about 1 meter in length (that’s six or seven years at 1⁄2 inch per month). Certainly,
Rapunzel could have jumped from a height of 1 meter, but if she had, the Brothers
Grimm wouldn’t have had much of a story for the millions of children who wanted
to believe in the magic of the prince who rescues the fair maid. Ignorance is bliss!

Linking Ethnicity with 
Hair Type and Loss
People aren’t all created equally — with respect to hair. Ethnicity
and race affect your hair type and density, as we explain for the
three ethnic groups in the following list. Keep in mind that
although certain ethnicities are more likely to have a certain type
and density of hair, variations do exist. There simply isn’t enough
space in this book for us to go into that much detail.
Why should you know about the connection between your ethnic-
ity and the type of hair on your head? Hair is a specialized organ
system probably related, in some cases, to the climates we’re born
into. For example, the African’s dark skin protects against strong
sunlight and sun burns, and his kinky hair becomes an efficient
heat exchanger to keep the body cool while providing some shade
from the hot sun.
There are, however, no explanations for the typically straight,
lower density hair of Asians when compared to Caucasians, or the
high density hair counts of many Northern Europeans. 
 Caucasian hair: Generally, Caucasians have the highest
number of hairs on their scalp. The density of hair on a typi-
cal Caucasian averages 200 hairs per one square centimeter.
A healthy Caucasian human scalp contains about 100,000 folli-
cles that produce thicker terminal hairs. (In comparison, the
human body has approximately five million non-scalp follicles
that produce the fine, vellus hair scattered around the body.)
Caucasian hair generally appears thick because it’s more diffi-
cult to see through to the scalp than on Asians and Africans. 
 Asian hair: Asians have fewer scalp hairs than Caucasians,
with about 140 to 160 hairs per square centimeter on the
average. A healthy Asian human scalp contains about 80,000
follicles. 
Asian hair tends to be straight and with a low density.
Visually, it doesn’t cover the head as well as the curly or wavy
hair of Caucasians. But some Asians have the coarsest and
thickest hairs, which can offset their lower hair density.
Visually, straight Asian hair just doesn’t cover well, and 
with their lower densities, the problem of see through hair is
compounded. 
Chapter 2: Splitting Hairs: Growth, Loss, and Change over Time 25

 African/African American hair: Of the three groups we out-
line here, African Americans have the lowest density of hair,
ranging from 120 to 140 hairs per square centimeter. A healthy
African or African American human scalp contains about
60,000 follicles.
Some Africans and African Americans actually have fine hairs,
and some is kinkier than others. Because African hair often
sticks together, it may appear that there’s more hair despite
the low hair densities that are characteristic of all Africans
and African Americans. Africans generally have a dark skin
which obscures the lower densities because of the low con-
trast between hair and skin color. 
Aging Hair: How It Changes 
with Time
Like the rest of you, your hair is impacted by age, sometimes for
the better, and other times, for the worse. There’s nothing you can
do to stop time from marching on in your hair cells, but knowing
what changes to expect can help you plan for ways to compensate
for them through the use of hair growth stimulating medications,
by styling changes. 
Knowing what’s normal and what’s not as you age may also help
you recognize early genetic hair loss and plan to treat it early, as
medications and transplantation work best when you still have
enough hair to work with.
Change of texture
Whether a baby’s hair sticks up all over or forms only a few wispy
curls, all baby hair is baby fine. But hair changes during childhood.
It remains soft but becomes bulkier. Through the teenage years
and into early adulthood, hair takes on an adult texture, becoming
coarser as a rule.
Hair counts are thought to be maintained well into the senior
years, at least for half of the human population. The other half
experiences hair loss prior to reaching their 50s.
The weight of each individual hair shaft is genetically imprinted in
your genes, as is the number of hairs you’re born with. It’s not
unusual for an adult to start off with a medium-coarse hair shaft,
only to find that as he or she ages, the hair becomes finer as the
thickness of the hair shaft changes in adulthood.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
26

This change is slow and, provided that the number of hairs on 
the head doesn’t drop off precipitously, the change usually isn’t
alarming. 
Of those men who have a full head of hair into their 60s, nearly half
will experience a substantial reduction in the thickness of each
individual hair shaft. 
One in three women will also experience an overall pattern of 
thinning hair in menopause, due to an increased sensitivity to the
male hormone testosterone.
Loss of hair
The presence of baldness genes and the hormone DHT (see
Chapter 4 for more on DHT and its role in hair loss) alone aren’t
enough to cause baldness. Even after a person has reached matu-
rity, susceptible hair follicles must continually be exposed to the
hormone over a period of time for hair loss to occur. The age at
which these effects finally manifest themselves varies from one
individual to another and is related to a person’s genetic composi-
tion and to the levels of testosterone in the bloodstream. 
Although balding can start in men in their teens, it’s unusual to see
it much before the age of 17, when there appears to be a genetic
switch that starts the process. For example, a 15 year old may have
a full head of hair until, all of a sudden, he passes an age in the
later teens (usually between 17 and 19) and a genetic switch is
flipped on and he starts losing his hair.
Hair loss doesn’t occur all at once, nor does it occur in a steady,
straight-line progression. People losing their hair experience alter-
nating periods of slow and rapid hair loss and even note periods of
stability. Many of the factors that cause the rate of loss to speed up
or slow down are unknown, but it’s proven that with age, a
person’s total hair volume decreases.
Even if there’s no predisposition to genetic balding, some hairs
randomly begin to shrink in width and not grow as long as a
person ages. As a result, each group of hairs contains both full ter-
minal hairs and thinner hairs (similar to the finer hairs that grow
on the rest of the body), making the scalp look less full.
Eventually, some of the thinner hairs are lost, and the actual
number of follicular units may be reduced (for an explanation of
follicular units, refer to the earlier section, “How hair grows”). In
about one third of adults, even the hair around the back and side
of the head (the fringe area) gradually thins over time.
Chapter 2: Splitting Hairs: Growth, Loss, and Change over Time 27

Fortunately, in most people, the fringe areas of hair retain enough
permanent hair to make hair transplantation possible — even for a
patient well into his 70s or 80s! In a small number of men, however,
the process of hair aging may start in the 20s or 30s, resulting in a
uniformly falling hair count. When this happens, transplantation is
more difficult because there’s not enough donor hair left to cover
balding areas. 
Hair through thick and thin
Some heads of hair appear thicker than others. The thickness of
the hair shaft is a factor in how full hair appears: A coarse, thicker
hair shaft has more bulk than a finer hair shaft. The texture is also
very important. 
In Caucasians, heavy, coarse hair isn’t a common trait, but if you
have it, your hair appears very, very thick. People with fine, thin
hair often have a “see-through” look, particularly in bright light,
even if they’re not balding; a natural higher density may offset this
look to some degree.
A good way to tell whether hair shafts have lost bulk between
childhood and adulthood is to think back to your childhood memo-
ries. We always ask patients the following question: “When you
were about 10 years old, do you remember members of your family
rubbing your hair for good luck?” With the 10 year old with coarse
hair, every aunt and uncle coming for a visit would rub his hair for
good luck, commenting on his healthy head of hair. People who
don’t recall this generally didn’t have coarse hair.
So when we see a man with see-through hair but normal hair 
densities, this question can illuminate the changes in hair bulk as
aging occurs. 
We’ve seen fair-skinned individuals color their hair to a lighter
color so that the contrast between their hair and skin color is mini-
mized, making their hair look distinctly fuller. When hair and skin
have similar colors (such as blonde hair on white skin), the cover-
age appears fuller than if there’s a high contrast in the colors (such
as black hair against white skin).
In a hair transplant, this contrast may dictate the surgical tech-
niques employed by the surgeon and the amount of hair that needs
to be moved in order to obtain a fuller look.

 Caring for children’s hair
H
air can be your crowning glory. Through the ages, people
have primped, crimped, colored, and pampered their locks.
Hair care products promising the wildest results overflow store
shelves. According to some commercials, the right shampoo can
change your life.
Even though you know that vibrant hair isn’t really going to change
your life all that much, it can make you feel better about yourself,
increase your confidence, and maybe even get you a few compli-
ments. Treating your hair well helps avoid damage that can result
in permanent hair loss, and it helps you keep the hair you have for
as long as possible.
In this chapter, we look at some structural qualities of your hair as
well as hair care products commonly used today. You find out how
the different ways styling and enhancing your hair can damage it,
and along the way, we explain how to go about kinder, gentler 
hair care. 
Although this chapter describes general hair care tips, the purpose
of including it in Hair Loss & Replacement For Dummies is to let you
know how proper hair care and various products can help slow the
hair loss process, help maintain the best quality of the hair you
have, and disguise your thinning hair.

Admiring the Adaptable 
Qualities of Hair
This may come as a surprise to you, but the hair on your head is
dead. Don’t feel too bad, though — everyone else’s hair is dead,
too. So why waste time taking care of something that’s dead? And if
it’s not alive, then how can you make your hair look better — or
last longer?
Even though your hair is dead, how you treat it can make it look
much better — or worse — because hair has many attributes of a
living organ and can repair itself under the right conditions.
Stripping away the coating: 
Inside your hair
It’s easier to care for your hair properly if you understand how the
individual parts of a human hair are affected by the way you care
for it. In this section, we look at the anatomy of a human hair.
Cutting into a hair
Hair is made up of dead compressed cells produced about 1⁄4 inch
below the skin. At the end of each hair is the hair bulb, which is
essentially the factory for making the hair; this part of the hair is
alive and working all the time. Each hair has its own bulb, and
damage to the hair bulb can result in permanent loss of that hair.
(Turn to Chapter 2 for a look at the anatomy of a hair follicle.)
Each individual hair can be compared to an electrical wire. If you
cut into a wire, you see that it has a rubbery outer covering and
twisted or bundled inner wires that carry electricity. Human hair is
made up of an outer covering called the cuticle that contains indi-
vidual bundles of hair called the cortex. The cuticle gives the hair
shaft a round or oval shape. Stripping off the cuticle would leave
the hair looking like a series of out of control wires.
The bundles (also called spindles) of hair cells in the cortex are
actually made up of even smaller bundles that literally twist as
they’re made. With African American hair, the hair cells are so
heavily twisted (up to 12 times more twists per length than
Caucasian hair) as the bundles are made that the hair is kinky. The
tight twists tend to kink the cuticle, producing pointed, vulnerable
edges that make the hair more susceptible to damage. The less the
twists, the straighter the hair. 
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
30

Combing the cuticles
The outer layer of the hair, the cuticle, protects the inner spindles
and bundles. The cuticle has scales that, like scales on a fish or
shingles on your roof, protect the hair within. When you take a
knife against the grain of scales on a fish, you take off the scales;
with the hair cuticle, imagine your fingers or comb rubbing against
the direction of the cuticle scales doing the same type of damage.
The scales make the cuticle porous, allowing the hair to breathe.
This is very important because the ability to hydrate hair depends
upon the porous nature of the cuticle. The scales also relate to
how the hair feels: When you stroke it one way, it feels smooth, and
the other way there’s a roughness to it.
Breaking the hair bonds
The bonds that help hold hair in a certain position can be broken
or rearranged, such as when hair is permed or straightened. There
are three types of bonds that determine the strength and the lift of
the hair:
 Hydrogen bonds: These bonds break down easily and give
hair its flexibility. Hydrogen bonds come apart when you wet
your hair and come back together again as your hair dries.
 Salt bonds: These are temporary and easy to rearrange
because they’re water-dependent and easily dissolved when
your hair is washed. Salt bonds are easily broken by weak
alkaline products like ammonia or acid solutions that contain
chlorine or copper peptide in high concentration and by
changes in pH. These bonds can be reformed by normalizing
the pH level of the hair with normalizing solutions available at
your local hair salons. 
 Disulfide bonds: These are relatively permanent and can only
be changed with perming and relaxing agents. Disulphide
bonds are stronger than hydrogen and salt bonds, and there
are fewer of them than the other types. Disulfide bonds are
the most important factors in supplying the hair with its
strength and durability, and as such, they can’t be broken by
heat or water.
Wet hair can be stretched by as much as 30 percent, and you 
can change the shape of the hair bonds when it’s stretched. For
example, when you put rollers on your wet hair and then allow the
hair to dry on the rollers, the hydrogen bonds take on the shape 
of the rollers, which essentially sets the hydrogen bonds in this
new shape.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 31

Keeping it greased: Sebum’s 
role in healthy hair
Your scalp helps keep your hair looking healthy by supplying an
abundant and constant production of sebum, a waxy material made
by sebaceous glands. It’s secreted onto the hair as it emerges from
the scalp through pores in the skin. The sebum works its way into
the hair on the surface of the cuticle, and it’s spread through the
hair as the hair moves in the wind, by combing it, touching it, and
by hairs rubbing against other adjacent hairs.
If hair is cut short, the same amount of sebum is produced, so rela-
tively more sebum covers less hair, causing it to appear more
greasy. (It also causes the bald pate to acquire a sheen rather
quickly after showering because there’s no hair to carry off the
oil.) There’s nothing you can do about oily hair other than wash
your hair more often and use a shampoo made especially for
greasy hair.
Adolescents have unusually high sebum output, which is why so
many teenagers complain of greasy or oily hair. We’re often asked
to prescribe drugs to decrease sebum production in teenagers who
hate their greasy hair. Some professionals feel that the sebum pro-
duction can be impacted by drugs such as Propecia or saw pal-
metto (an herb; see Chapter 10), which block production of the
DHT hormone, but studies show no connection between a lack of
DHT production and decreased sebum production.
Choosing and Using 
the Right Products
The right shampoo and conditioner can work wonders on your
hair, helping it stay not only shiny and attractive but also healthy.
With shelves and shelves of products available in stores, how do
you know which ones to choose? Should you go for the one with
the most four-syllable ingredients on the label, or maybe the one
with the label that coordinates with your bathroom colors? Or are
they all the same, and the cheapest will do?
In this section, we help you pick out products that will benefit your
hair, as well as describe the improvements that science has
brought to the world of hair care products and how they affect you
and your locks.

Looking at today’s hair 
care products
Things have definitely changed for the better in the industrialized
world. Today, it’s not unusual to wash your hair frequently, some-
times more than once a day. Although this is a good move from
both a visual and an odor perspective, it means that modern 
shampoos must be designed to prevent damage incurred by 
frequent use.
Shampooing your hair removes environmental particles that may
build up during your daily activities. People who work in dirty
environments (such as shoveling coal in a coal mine) or even just
outside all day will clearly build up more particulate matter than
those people who work indoors. Cleaning your hair removes any
particulate matter as well as the sebum that builds up throughout
the day.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 33
Remembering the “no wash” years
For centuries, hair care was a time consuming, uncomfortable process that often did
more harm than good. Before shampoo was invented, harsh soaps, often made of
animal fats, were used to scrub the hair in much the same way as you scrub your
hands today to clean them. The washing process left scummy soap deposits stick-
ing to the hair, which made it look dull. Scrubbing got the dirt out, but with varying
degrees of damage in the process.
Because hair washing in the old days was a major ordeal for many people, 
particularly women with long hair, it wasn’t unusual to avoid the process until such
a time as it became impossible to ignore. The unwashed hair built up sebum
(grease), which stuck to the 100 to 150 hairs shed daily and flakes of shed skin. 
This all resulted in the hair becoming matted overnight. Tossing and turning in one’s
sleep resulted in a semi-permanent “bed head” as mats of hair became cemented
to each other.
The result not only looked bad, but it also smelled pretty ghastly. People tried to
manage the problem with powders to hide the visuals and perfumes to mask the
odors. These powders added more particulate matter to the mats of hair and sebum,
making the problem much worse in the long run. So if you’ve ever lamented the fact
that you need to wash your hair regularly, be thankful that you can do just that!

Attracting positive products to your hair
You probably never knew this, but hair has a small negative electric
charge. Thinking back to high school chemistry, you may remember
that opposite charges attract. That means that you can use chemi-
cals and products that have a positive charge to them in an effort to
treat mild damage to your hair. These products are attracted to the
negatively charged hair and coat the hair cuticle, restoring the
shine to dull, dry hair and making it more manageable.
One product that can help your hair through electricity is condi-
tioner, which carries a weak positive charge. The positive mole-
cules in the conditioner, which contains silicone, stick to the
negatively charged hair shafts, and the conditioner molecules pen-
etrate the scales of the cuticle, allowing moisture to reach the
matrix of the hair shaft. This moisture increases the hair’s shine
and luster and the depth of the hair color.
Add this to the conditioning properties that help detangle the hair
when combing it, and you get conditioners that make hair softer
and easier to manage — wet or dry.
Getting the tangles out
Most modern shampoos also contain some conditioning agents
mixed in with the cleansers for easy combing of wet hair. You also
have the option of using a separate conditioner for even better
detangling.
If you’re having difficulty detangling your hair, applying more and
more conditioner won’t help. Rather, dry your hair and then use a
detangling agent. 
Dreadlocks or long kinky hair can be a detangling nightmare. It
may help to separate your hair into sections and go through each
section using a long knitting needle. Detangle it from the scalp out-
ward if possible; you may run into a knot that you need to detangle
against the direction of the scales on the cuticle.
Damage to the hair structure during the detangling process is a 
real risk, so this process should never be rushed. In other words,
attempting to yank your comb through a tangle is a hair care no-no.
Adding chemicals
Shampoos and conditioners are more than cleaning agents:
They’re also an alphabet soup of chemicals. Various chemicals are
added to
 Control the viscosity (thickness of the solution).
 Control the pH (the degree of acidity present).
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
34

 Act as preservation agents to ensure that bacteria doesn’t
grow in the shampoos and conditioners.
 Make the products attractive. Coloring agents are used in con-
junction with perfumes to make the product please both your
eyes and your nose.
Hair care products often include chemicals such as dimethicone
and panthenol (a vitamin B derivative), which are absorbed into
the hair shaft and provide moisture to dry areas when the new hair
grows. These compounds are more easily absorbed by the hair
when surfactants are also added to the mix (see the section
“Keeping things slippery with surfactants” in this chapter for
more); surfactants help overcome the body’s sebum, which can
prevent full absorption of moisture in the hair.
Certain shampoos contain compounds like zinc pyrithione to treat
flaky scalps (otherwise known as dandruff). These shampoos gen-
erally state on the packaging whether they’re recommended for
people with dandruff. All shampoos that claim to treat dandruff
must meet FDA over-the-counter drug requirements.
Volumizing shampoos and conditioners that add moisture to the
hair shaft, thereby increasing the bulk of the hair, contain such
unpronounceable products as polyquarternium and stearami-
daproply dimethylamine, which alter the electric charge on the
hair shaft. These tongue twisters are particularly important in
winter months when the air is dry, especially in heated buildings.
Keeping things slippery with surfactants
Today’s commercial shampoos contain compounds called surfac-
tants, compounds that accomplish a number of things when added
to shampoo. Surfactants
 Help shampoo lather up in hard or soft water.
 Help hair rinse easily and thoroughly.
 Eliminate the need for hard scrubbing, which can damage
your hair.
 Facilitate removal of grease and any dirt from the scalp and
hair, because the surfactant can penetrate physical barriers,
such as flakes of skin and dirt, embedded in the skin or hair.
 Facilitate the foaming properties of a shampoo, which helps
lift the particulate materials (dirt) into the foam. A thicker
shampoo with surfactants in it will easily spread through 
the hair.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 35

 Maintain a balance between the penetrating power of the
shampoo and the sensitivity of the scalp skin, which benefits
people with sensitive skin.
Picking the proper shampoo
You have a myriad of shampoo options, but selecting the right one
for your hair isn’t really that difficult when you understand the cat-
egories. Shampoos are generally geared toward use on normal,
fine, or dry hair; you just have to figure out which one you have.
Here’s a breakdown:
 Normal hair
• Is neither greasy nor dry.
• Isn’t permed or color treated.
• Generally holds its style well, without the use of lots of
products.
• Looks good most of the time.
 Fine hair
• Tends to be limp.
• Looks flat and lacks volume.
• Is difficult to manage.
• Becomes greasy soon after it’s washed.
 Dry hair
• Is dull.
• Is frizzy.
• Feels rough.
• Has been treated with perms or coloring agents.
• Tangles easily.
Excess oils tend to weigh the hair down, making it difficult to
manage, because the oil clings to dirt and particulate matter.
Because sebum is easily spread by passing your fingers through
your hair, don’t run your fingers through your hair after you finish
drying and styling it. 
And if your hair is greasy, be sure to use a shampoo designed for
greasy hair. It has more powerful surfactants to get the grease off
of the scalp and hair shafts, but be aware that more powerful 
surfactants may be more irritating to the eyes and skin.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
36

Shampoos don’t alter the physical properties of the hair, so hair
will be just as pliable and strong after a shampoo as it was before.
But conditioners in the shampoo can interfere with perming and
coloring. You can offset the impact by using shampoos that con-
tain silicone micro-emulsifiers.
Washing and drying your 
hair correctly
You may not think you need instructions for washing your hair, but
there’s a right way and a wrong way to do everything, including
washing and drying your hair! Follow these instructions and you’ll
end up with less hair damage and healthier, better-looking hair:
1. Wet your hair with plain warm water.
2. Put the shampoo in your hands and rub them together to
get the lather up before applying it to your hair.
3. Work the shampoo into the scalp and massage gently
with your finger tips to get the lather up.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 37
Knowing when to trust the label
Because the FDA is involved in the regulation of claims on the labels and the adver-
tising material on these products, you can generally trust the claims if the company
is well known. On the other hand, many fly-by-night companies will risk making
incredible claims, hoping to fly under the FDA radar, to get you to buy their product.
These products often show up on late night infomercials and feature someone
wearing a white lab coat (who almost assuredly is not a doctor, although you’re
meant to think he is).
Because hair products don’t have to be cleared by the FDA before they go on the
market, there’s no central place to go to find out if a product is safe and their ads are
truthful. If the FDA finds that the product is being falsely advertised, they will first act
by serving the company a “cease and desist” letter. It can take considerable time
before a company removes a product from the market under these circumstances. 
The safety and effectiveness of these products may not have been rigorously tested
and you don’t want to become a victim of some possibly unsafe product while wait-
ing for the FDA to answer a complaint and then put them out of business; the best
thing to do is to buy products from companies that are well known rather than those
that advertise on late night TV.

4. Let your hair hang while you rinse it thoroughly.
If you’re in a bath tub, lean your head forward as you rinse
the shampoo out with warm water.
5. If you’re not using a shampoo that contains conditioner,
put a separate conditioner in your hands and apply it to
the scalp first before working it into the hair. Leave it on
for at least a couple of minutes and then rinse thoroughly
with warm water.
Shampoos combined with conditioners can be very effec-
tive for most men with short hair and for hair that’s not
damaged.
6. Towel-dry your hair gently by patting it; don’t rub your
scalp and hair briskly with the towel and don’t blow-dry
your hair when soaking wet.
7. Comb or brush your wet hair gently. If you use a condi-
tioner properly, the tangles should be relatively easy to
take out with a wide-toothed plastic comb or brush.
8. If you use a mousse, gel, or setting agent, it’s best applied
after you pat-dry your hair, when the hair is still damp.
So-called wet gels give the hair a glossy appearance.
9. If you blow-dry your hair, don’t do so when the hair is
soaking wet. 
If you use a blow-dryer, be sure to keep it moving con-
stantly so that the heat isn’t concentrated in one area of
your hair. It’s always best to use the lowest heat and the
lowest speed you can get away with because high heat
causes hair damage. Also, damage generally occurs at the
end of the blow-drying cycle, so always turn off the drier
before your hair is completely dry.
How Gels, Sprays, and Other
Chemicals Impact Hair Shape
Hair sprays, gels, perms, and other chemical products and
processes exist for only one reason: So you can force your hair to
do what you want. It’s part of human nature to want what you
don’t have. People with straight hair want curls and people with
curly hair are constantly trying to tame it into straight submission.
Hair, however, has a mind of its own and has certain built-in char-
acteristics that must be overcome if you want it to do your bid-
ding. Some factors that influence the look of your hair are:
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
38

 The thickness of the hair shafts
 The density of the hair
 The natural stiffness of the hair (which keeps it from lying on
the scalp like a wet noodle)
 The natural curvature of the hair
 The slippery nature of the hair (how it slides over its neigh-
boring hairs)
 The cohesiveness of the hair (how it sticks to other hairs)
This section looks at the ways changing your look with chemical
products and processes can also change the composition of your
hair — for better, for worse, and sometimes forever.
Thickening your hair
Who wants flat, wimpy hair, the kind that lacks body or bounce?
Limp hair is almost always very fine hair, because fine hair shafts
don’t have enough thickness to maintain their stiffness and to
stand away from the scalp. Hair that’s naturally curved takes up
more room and makes hair appear fuller than it actually is. (People
from Mediterranean areas, such as France, Spain, and Italy, are
famous for lush, wavy, full-bodied hair.)
Using styling gels or a mousse that attach to your hair shafts can
give your hair a thicker appearance, even if “flat as a pancake”
describes your normal hair to a T. Gels and mousses increase the
roughness of the hair in addition to giving the appearance of a
thicker hair shaft.
The increased roughness of the hairs makes them bond to each
other, which makes your hair appear fuller. When your hair is fine,
it’s not a good idea to use smoothing products that take away the
rough character of the hair because your hair can end up appear-
ing even thinner than it actually is.
You may have to try several different mousses and gels to find
what works best for your hair because there are so many products
on the market that you need to experiment to find the one that fits
you needs best). Mousses and some gels are particularly good for
fine hair to increase the sense of hair bulk.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 39

Reshaping hair
Setting can help you reshape your hair’s natural appearance by
giving it more volume. Blow-drying with a round brush to form the
hair and then using rollers to hold it in position until the drying is
complete is a common setting technique.
Setting wet hair with the help of a foam or gel increases the curva-
ture of the hair shaft. Shampooing helps this process because sur-
factants in the shampoo penetrate the hair shaft, making the dried
hair respond better to what you’re doing to it. (Refer to the earlier
section, “Keeping things slippery with surfactants,” for more on
these compounds in shampoo.)
Teasing hair is a common method of increasing volume, but
repeated teasing will permanently damage the hair because it
breaks the scales off the hair cuticle, and these broken scales can’t
repair themselves. (The section, “Combing the cuticles,” earlier in
this chapter explains the cuticles and scales.)
All the following materials are useful in setting hair because they
create adhesion of the hairs. They form films on the hair shafts
that dry and hold one hair to another (like a weld on the hair), 
producing a better lift and therefore a better illusion of volume and
fullness.
 Water-based materials such as gels, mousses, and foams:
These wash off easily with a good shampoo.
 Hair spray: Hair spray forms a hard film that bonds the hair
into place. Combing sprayed hair that has dried can break the
hair at the bonding point. Therefore, it’s best not to mess with
the hair after you apply hair spray, or if you do attempt to
restyle it, be very careful not to tug on the hair as you comb it
again.
Many people spray on way more hair spray than needed, 
leaving the hair overly saturated and making it very difficult
to remove the hair spray completely with one shampoo 
application.
 Hair waxes and pomades: These are more complex to apply
and much more difficult to remove, but a good strong sham-
poo with a very active surfactant will clean waxes and
pomades off the hair shafts, although it may take more than
one washing.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
40

The advantage of waxes and pomades is that they stay in
place and hold the hair against wind and even rain because
they’re not water-soluble. Waxes act like a plaster cast,
imparting a rigidity to the hair shaft, and they work well in
hair of any length. The spiked hair of many movie and rock
stars is achieved using waxes and pomades.
Unlike hair-sprayed hair, which is difficult to remold, wax-
based products make it easy to rework the shape of the hair
again and again. They’re so durable that you could restyle
your hair as you walked down the street (although you may
prefer to do it in front of a mirror)!
Changing Your Natural Look:
Dyeing and Processing
More than half of people over age 50 have gray hair, but you’d
never know it. More people dye their hair to look younger than 
do any other age-defying beauty enhancement. But if you want to
keep your hair as long as possible, it pays to be careful with dyes,
because improper use of dyes can do permanent damage to 
your hair.
Graying generally starts at the temples and then spreads to other
parts of the scalp. Contrary to urban legend, your hair can’t turn
white overnight, although it may seem like it does when you let too
much time elapse between coloring!
Dyeing your hair can take years off you — but it can also be bad
for your hair. Plant-based dyes such as henna are less likely to
cause irritation, but the color doesn’t last as long as if you use
chemical dyes.
Most commercial hair dyes today contain the chemical para-
Phenylenediamine (PPD) as an active ingredient. It’s not uncom-
mon to develop skin sensitivity to permanent dyes containing PPD,
so be sure to test the product on a small area before covering your
whole head with hair color for the first time. Always check for the
presence of PPD in the dye that you are going to use. Even though
semi permanent dyes are not supposed to have PPD in them, never
assume this for your own safety. 
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 41

There are two types of patch testing for PPD: 
 Apply a 20-percent dilution of the dye being tested to a small
area on your neck below the collar; wait a full 72 hours to see
if there’s a reaction, which would mean a sensitivity to PPD. A
reaction produces a reddened, rashy, or inflamed area of skin
in the area covered by the test solution. 
 Apply a patch containing a 2 percent concentration of PPD in
a petrolatum base to the skin and leave it there for up to three
days. If a rash or reddening occurs, remove the patch. 
Sensitivities may arise even if you’ve been using a dye containing
PPD for years, so not being sensitive initially to the PPD doesn’t
mean that you won’t become sensitive to it over time. 
How nature colors hair
Two types of pigment (called melanin) in the hair bulb create hair
color, which is produced below the skin, deep in the dermal fat
about 1⁄4 inch from the surface of the skin. The colors you see are
imprinted on the cortex of the hair fibers; the cuticle that covers
the hair bundles is clear.
These two pigments affect your hair in the following ways:
 Eumelanin, the most common pigment, controls black and
brown colors (slightly different dominant genes)
 Phaeomelanin has a red color to it; all humans have some
degree of red pigment in their hair, except for people whose
hair is stark white 
The amount of eumelanin in the hair determines the darkness of
the color in the following way:
 Brown eumelanin in large quantities will make the hair 
dark brown.
 Brown eumelanin in low quantities will produce a blond color.
 Black eumelanin will make the hair black. 
 Black eumelanin in very low concentrations will create 
gray hair.
Most hair colors are a balance between brown, black, and red pig-
ment, based upon the amount of these pigments that blend
together. Northern Europe has more blond-haired people than any-
where else, and Scotland has the highest redheaded population
(up to 10 percent of Scots are redheads). The rest of the human
race has dark pigment granules. If you bleach your hair, you oxi-
dize these pigments and they lose their color.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
42

If you have no pigment-producing cells (as happens as some
people age), your hair will be white. Albinos have no pigment gran-
ules and have white hair — even their eyebrows and eyelashes.
Phaeomelanin is a robust pigment with a strong impact on the hair.
It’s hard to get hair with a high percentage of phaeomelanin to
respond to dyes and bleaches. Salon operators know that when
people bleach their hair, their natural red pigment lingers, so it’s
not unusual for bleached hair to show a red or orange tinge (par-
ticularly in blonds) and over time turn orange and various shades
of yellow with exposure to light.
How dyes work
Hair dyes can be either permanent or semi-permanent. Both are
easy to apply at home, reasonably inexpensive, and very popular,
but can also be damaging to your hair, especially if they’re not
used properly.
Settling for semi-permanent
Semi-permanent dyes are acidic and are made of small molecules
that can pass through the scales of the cuticle and into the hair
cortex. These dyes are water-soluble and easily washed out. They
may last from one to six weeks, depending on what dyes are used,
but they lose color faster with frequent washings. Semi-permanent
dyes are generally safe and can be used at home. Because they
don’t contain bleach, they can’t lighten hair, but they can darken
graying hair.
If you decide you’re unhappy with your new semi-permanent color,
many home ingredients can help you rinse out the dye. Common
hair rinse ingredients found around the house include tea, beer
(which is also thought to add body to the hair and make it more
manageable), lemon juice, and heavily diluted honey (50 drops in a
pint of water). Rinse with any of these remedies after washing your
hair if you want the dye out faster. The sooner you wash out the
dye, the quicker it will come out. 
You may not want to walk around with your hair smelling of 
beer, so you can follow up the rinse with a more pleasant smelling
shampoo.
Going platinum
Bleaches oxidize the melanin granules in the cortex of the hair,
causing them to lose their color. This is an irreversible chemical
alteration in the hair itself and can’t be washed out. The most
common bleach for hair is hydrogen peroxide, which can be used
in conjunction with dyes to achieve the desired color. 
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 43

Bleaches are often alkaline solutions, just like the neutralizing solu-
tions used for perms, which open the scales on the cuticle (for
more on perms, see the later section, “Perming your hair”). When
you bleach dark hair, the small concentrations of phaeomelanin
are resistant to the bleach so it’s not unusual to see a red tinge on
bleached dark hair.
The powerful bleach needed to obtain the platinum blond look will
almost certainly damage the hair cuticle, especially if it takes sev-
eral applications to achieve the desired color, each adding more
damage to the cuticle. The hair loses its silky feel because of the
cuticle damage.
Bleaching also makes hair more porous, which can produce
uneven shading. As new hair grows in its original color at the scalp
level, the entire head of hair often must be bleached again to cover
it, producing more potential damage to the older part of the hair
shaft. Some people just bleach their roots, targeting the hair close
to the scalp but leaving the hair that emerges from the scalp in its
original color.
With repeated bleaching, wet combing is difficult because the hair
cuticle isn’t smooth and has many damaged scales. Back combing
(or teasing) this hair just compounds the problem, producing
mechanical damage and hair breakage as the scales are knocked
off. Bleached hair also swells very easily because it’s so porous,
and hair is much weaker when it’s wet.
Putting on permanent coloring
Permanent hair coloring can be applied to the whole head or just
in select areas for streaks or highlights. Before hair can be perma-
nently dyed, all the existing color has to be removed by a strong
hydrogen peroxide (in a concentration of 30 to 40 percent) that
bleaches out all the melanin granules. This may produce some per-
manent damage to the keratin in the hair cortex, leaving the hair
with a lifeless look.
Ammonia is the alkaline chemical applied to open the cuticle and
allow the hair color to penetrate the cortex of the hair. It also acts
as a catalyst (accelerating the chemical reaction) when the perma-
nent hair color comes together with the peroxide.
Various alcohols and conditioners may also be present in perma-
nent hair color. The conditioners close the scales on the cuticle
after coloring in order to seal the new color to the cortex. Closing
the scales of the cuticle is important to maintain the moisture of
the hair cortex. 
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
44

The FDA requires that warnings appear on permanent hair color
packaging to alert you to possible damage to your hair if directions
aren’t followed exactly. Read the instructions in the packages 
carefully.
Perming your hair
Many men and women who are experiencing hair thinning opt for a
perm to give their hair a fuller look. You can find more on ways to
conceal hair loss in Chapter 8.
Perming your hair correctly is an art. The process is actually quite
intricate. Chew on this info when sitting in the salon next time you
get a perm!
Permanents use strong alkaline chemicals to break down the disul-
fide bonds in your hair and open the cortex of the hair fibers
within the cuticle so they’re able to take on water and reshape
themselves anatomically. After the bonds are broken down, the
hair can be reformed by using perm rods (the wider the rod, the
looser the curl).
Neutralizers that reset your hair in the new curled pattern are
applied after rinsing away the setting agent. The neutralizers con-
tain oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide, which harden the
cement that bonds the hair fibers with its keratin and reform the
disulphide bonds to their new shape.
When setting agents are on your hair, your hair is very vulnerable
to damage. Changes in the temperature (a person running out of
the salon to say hello to someone passing by in the street) can
cause damage. The longer the chemicals are in the hair shaft, the
more chance there is of damage to the cuticle, and a damaged hair
cuticle can leave hair more susceptible to damage from the
perming chemicals.
Although the setting agent is washed out before your hair is neu-
tralized, some of the solution will remain in the cortex and con-
tinue to have an influence on the hair bundles. For this reason, it’s
important not to wash your hair for three days after perming, or it
may lose the perm prematurely.
Fine hair is more likely to be damaged by repeated perming treat-
ments because the cuticles are thin and the shaft cement and the
hair bundles don’t contain much bulk for repeated reshaping.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 45

Some people just don’t perm well; their hair is resistant to the
process, requiring more chemicals and possibly more risks in the
perming process. Stronger chemicals increase the risks, so expert-
ise is critical. Permanent damage to the hair and to the growth
center below the skin surface increases in probability as stronger
chemicals are used to perm or relax the hair. (The next section
covers relaxing treatments.)
Relaxing your hair
People with curly or kinky hair use relaxing treatments to make
their hair more manageable; it’s most common among African
Americans or others with unmanageably curly hair. Relaxing is a
similar process to perming because the disulphide bond and
reforming process in the setting stage is identical, but it’s different
in that the goal is to straighten the hair, not to curl and shape it.
The shape of the hair shaft of the very curly or kinky hair adds a
mechanical problem to the straightening process.
Unfortunately, some people are so aggressive with hair straighten-
ing chemicals that they do permanent damage to some or all of
their hair. Overusing the setting agents can damage the hair above
the skin at the hair shaft level or below the skin in the living parts
of the hair follicle and cause the hairs to break off. We’ve seen
almost complete permanent hair loss from an overly aggressive
use of these setting agents. Damage can be limited by making sure
you follow the directions on the use of these chemicals to the
letter. 
Hot irons may be used in conjunction with relaxing treatments to
straighten kinky hair, causing injury to the underlying anatomy of
the hair. It’s actually easier and less dangerous to straighten very
kinky long hair by putting wet hair under a paper bag and using a
hot iron on top of the bag. The paper minimizes the damage to the
cuticle because it insulates the hair from the high temperatures of
the hot iron.
Avoiding Hair Damage
Hair is under constant assault, not only from the elements (sun,
wind, and rain) but also from you, its owner. There are endless
ways to torture your hair into submission — and in some cases the
damage can be permanent. In this section, we look at the things
that make your hair cry uncle and things you can do to counteract
the damage you may have already inflicted.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
46

Because you’re constantly producing new hair, you can get a fresh
start, a second chance at caring for your hair if you did things
wrong in the recent past. This means that you replace the old dam-
aged hair with new freshly growing hair, but it will take months for
this process to occur (hair grows at 1⁄2 inch per month). Improper
use of permanent dyes or hair setting agents can damage all of the
hair on top of your head. 
You may have to wait a year or two for new growth to replace that
which must be cut away, but the hair will grow back, as long as you
haven’t inflicted permanent damage on the hair root. The longer
you want your hair, the longer the wait. 
Hair in thinning areas is often finer than hair on other parts of your
head. Thinning hair also grows more slowly. If hair in the frontal or
crown areas where hair is starting to miniaturize (the step before it
disappears permanently) is damaged in any way, its growth may
stop completely until it has time to recover — and at that point,
the hair may be about to disappear permanently. 
Unfortunately, the period where hair begins to thin is the time
people often start trying to make their thinning hair look better by
dyeing it. Aggressive dying may finish off the balding process
ahead of time. 
Most people do dastardly things to their hair on a daily basis; here
are just a few of the worst offenses:
 Drying with a blow-dryer: Deep in the cortex are air pockets
that give hair an added bounce. These air pockets have mois-
ture in them, and if you blow-dry your hair at a high tempera-
ture, you can boil the moisture and cause the hair shaft to
explode! So a moderate temperature is essential when you
blow-dry your hair.
 Using hot rollers: These curl-creators may be the single most
damaging thing for hair because they apply heat directly to
your hair.
 Exposing hair to direct sunlight: Heat decreases the amount
of moisture in your hair, causing problems similar to those of
blow-drying. Exposing your hair to high doses of ultraviolet
light from direct sunlight can cause significant damage to the
disulphide bonds in the keratin.
 Rubbing too hard to dry hair: If you rub your hair roughly
with a towel, the friction pulls out hair and may produce
mechanical damage to the remaining hair shafts.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 47

 Hacking it with dull scissors: Dull scissors can split apart the
cuticle, leaving broken hair with split ends that tend to peel
down the hair shaft.
 Back brushing: Think of your hair as a one-way street which
runs from the scalp to the tip of the hair follicle. When you
brush or comb the hair against the scales, going from the tip
of the follicle to the scalp, you can irreversibly damage the
shaft and break the hair. Intact, unbroken cuticle cells are
glossy and smooth and give hair its shine and luster. Back
brushing changes the character of the cuticle so that it loses
its shine and luster.
 Using a metal comb or brushing too hard: Plastic combs
create much less friction than metal combs and are a better
choice. Combing or brushing wet hair can fracture the hair
shafts, but conditioners can help by detangling and allowing a
comb to be passed through the hair without tugging on it,
which may cause it to fracture. When combing, start at the
ends and work your way up to the scalp, making sure to stay
with the grain by combing downward away from the scalp.
 Perming: As we explain in the earlier section, “Perming your
hair,” the perming process breaks apart the scales so that
water can be absorbed and the hair can be reshaped. Leaving
perm solution on for too long or perming too often can perma-
nently damage the hair shaft.
 Bleaching or coloring: The earlier section, “How dyes work,”
explains how bleaching or coloring your hair can damage the
cuticle and increase the porosity of the hair shaft, weakening
the hair by allowing it to absorb too much moisture.
 Putting rubber bands around it: Rubber bands can cause
traction alopecia by putting too much pressure on the hair
shafts. In fact, constant pulling of the hair from any source can
cause traction alopecia.
 Using hair sprays: Hair spray coats the cuticle and changes
its porosity, and it makes hairs bind to each other and pull at
the points of contact. They can produce traction from the con-
stant pulling that may fracture the hair cuticle and the spin-
dles below, exposing the cortex to possible environmental
damage.
Most hair sprays are water-soluble, so if you wash your hair daily
after using hair sprays, the hair spray chemicals and bonds they
form are usually washed away, decreasing the chance of damage.
An occasional bad hair day doesn’t mean you’ve permanently dam-
aged your hair; bad hair days usually are caused by a reduction in
static electricity in your hair, which is due to weather conditions
and not by anything you’ve done to your hair.
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
48

You guarantee that your hair will recover poorly from damage from
the various hair treatments you subject it to if you don’t give it an
opportunity for repair with good washing and conditioning. Once
the cuticle cracks or breaks and the cortex is damaged, only a
good hair cut (removing the damaged hair by cutting it off) will
allow you to get the healthy hair look you want.
When hair is damaged, it appears dull and feels rough, losing that
silky feel. Fortunately, with time, the hair grows out and you can
cut away that damaged hair as the younger part of the hair near
the base of the scalp replaces the old hair.
Maintaining a Healthy Scalp
There’s a common misconception that balding means there’s
something wrong with the scalp. But because hair actually starts
growing from below the scalp, the scalp itself has little to do with
hair loss or hair health.
When hair loss occurs because of male genetic hair loss (or any
other cause), the blood supply to the area drops because it isn’t
needed where there isn’t any hair. When surgeons transplant new
hair, the circulation in the scalp improves as the new hair grows
out (in effect recruiting the blood supply it needs). (You can find
more about hair transplantation in Part V.)
We generally tell patients that if they shampoo with a good com-
mercial product and use a conditioner once a day, the skin of the
scalp should remain moist and well taken care of.
You can impact your scalp circulation in a number of ways, some
of which may affect your hair indirectly. Things that are bad for the
scalp and its circulation include:
 Smoking: As shown in ultrasound studies, smoking reduces
scalp circulation. Because this occurs with each cigarette,
over time smoking may contribute to whatever hair loss is
occurring on the head. Most doctors strongly believe this con-
nection, although definitive scientific proof is lacking.
 Sun exposure: Repeated sunburns on the scalp may impact
structures deep in the scalp causing the hair producing cells
to shrink. Combining genetic hair loss and intense ultraviolet
light may speed up the balding process.
 Skin cancer: Skin cancer comes in three different types, two
of which can be deadly by spreading throughout your body
(malignant melanomas and squamous cell cancers). These
cancers almost always appear in sun exposed skin.
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 49

Melanomas can rapidly spread beyond the confines of the
local area and they can be very small flat, mole like, frequently
black tumors. The third type of cancer, basal cell cancer) usu-
ally remains local but it often produces ulcers on the skin, and
they can grow to a significant size. 
When balding occurs, the scalp is exposed to the impact of
ultraviolet light from direct sunlight, and the skin changes
from a smooth, uniform colored skin, to a skin that has spots
and discolorations throughout. Hair protects the scalp from
direct sunlight and can produce enough shade to reduce the
risks of skin cancers. 
 Dermatologic conditions: A variety of conditions can impact
the skin and scalp. See Chapter 5 for more.
 Folliculitis: This is an infection of the hair follicles. It appears
as acne or red or white bumps on the scalp skin and may have
to be treated with soaks, antibiotics, or a minor surgical inci-
sion. It should never be picked or scratched, as this may
increase the incidence of permanent scarring and may spread
the infection from an infected hair follicle to one that is not
infected. 
Folliculitis rarely causes permanent hair loss, but it may cause
the hair to prematurely enter the telogen (sleep) phase of the
hair cycle. 
 Chlorine and salt water: Frequent swimming in chlorine pools
or salt water without shampooing and conditioning afterward
has the ability to cause hair and scalp damage from the heavy
salt or chlorine exposure. The salt can dry the scalp.
Many patients believe that dandruff may cause balding, but this is
not true. Other patients report having an itchy or tingling scalp,
and they believe it’s a precursor of the balding process. This com-
plaint is actually quite common and may be a sign of early genetic
hair loss.
Caring for Children’s Hair
Want to get a head start on healthy heads of hair for your kids?
You can do this by teaching them how to properly wash and dry
their hair. Help them learn non-destructive styling techniques
(until they reach the age where their friends know way more than
you do about hair — and everything else).
Many babies have little hair to work with, and what hair they have
is often very fine, delicate, and easily damaged. As a child grows,
new hair grows that’s often thicker than the baby hairs seen in the
first year of life. 
Part I: Getting to Know Your Hair 
50

In many infants, the new hair grown at about one year may have 
a completely different texture or color than what was previously
present!
Probably the most damage to children’s hair comes from the 
styles used to make them look cute or to keep their hair out of
their faces! Ponytails, pigtails, and braids can pull out the hair at
the roots and produce traction alopecia (see Chapter 5 for more 
on traction alopecia). This hair loss condition is very common
among African American children, who often have multiple pigtails
that pull on the scalp in many areas, or Caucasian children with
wild or very curly hair. Unfortunately, this type of hair loss is often
permanent.
People take so much pride in the way their children look that they
often treat the kids like dolls, using hairstyles that are counter to
the hair’s natural growing tendencies and that can harm the hair
over time. To avoid damaging a young person’s hair, follow these
recommendations (most of the rules discussed earlier in this chap-
ter apply just as much to children as they do to adults):
 Don’t keep rubber bands in the hair overnight.
 Rotate hairstyles so that one area isn’t always receiving
traction. For example, do a ponytail one day, braids the next,
and then leave it loose with a headband for a day or two.
 Use a good conditioner to make the hair slide more easily
when you’re combing out knots. For longer hair, use detan-
gling agents along with a good conditioner to minimize the
formation of knots in the first place. 
As with adult hair, always start at the end of the hair and work
toward the scalp, not the other direction. (Hardly anyone
does this properly, but now you know!)
When working on knots, hold the hair between the ends and
the scalp tightly in one hand as you comb the hair so that the
child doesn’t feel the pain of the comb pulling on the hair.
 Use a plastic comb rather than a brush to prevent static
electricity from building on the hair as it dries. Static elec-
tricity will make the hair stand up with more exposure to the
elements like sun, heat, and wind.
 Never back comb the hair, as this is guaranteed to damage
children’s delicate hair shafts.
 Encourage children’s involvement in hair care. Show 
them how to properly wash and dry their hair and comb 
out tangles, and help them choose a flattering and easy care
hairstyle. 
Chapter 3: Taking Better Care of Your Hair 51

Fostering independence in proper hair grooming should be
your goal.
 Inspect your children’s hair on a regular basis, especially
when they start school. Hair lice is practically a rite of pas-
sage for school-aged children and is easily spread from child
to child. Early detection and treatment is important in mini-
mizing any effects that head lice can have on the hair, such as
permanent patches of hair loss.
 Make hair care fun. Hair care should be an enjoyable 
experience. 
Get off to a good start by using no-tears shampoos and patting
hair dry to eliminate the pain and suffering of hair washing.
Play with suds, styling dramatic and funny do’s.
Managing your children’s hair gives you an opportunity to
share an important common experience. Throughout your
children’s lives, hair will be important, and if you use their
hair to help instill pride in their looks, you help enhance their
self-esteem.

The Root of Hair Loss:
How and Why It
Happens

In this part . . . 
A
ll hair loss isn’t the same. People lose hair due to
hereditary factors, illnesses, and a number of other
reasons. In this section, we look at how and why hair loss
occurs as well as what you can do to prevent it.

Chapter 4
Types of Hair Loss and
Pattern Thinning in 
Men and Women
In This Chapter
 Defining the various types of hair loss
 Understanding how heredity and disease can cause hair loss
 Looking at how your lifestyle impacts your hair
 Exploring causes of pattern thinning in men and women
P
eople have different ideas about what constitutes hair loss
and what causes it. Some people see three or four hairs in the
sink after combing and panic. Others don’t think they’re losing
their hair until the back bald spot meets the middle bald spot and
there’s nothing left to comb. When it comes to figuring out why
they’re going bald, some people assume it’s genetic, and therefore
unavoidable, whereas others are less accepting and look into every
possible way to save their hair.
In this chapter, we define male and female balding patterns, explain
why balding occurs, describe how pattern baldness is recognized
and classified, and give you some ideas on how your lifestyle can
affect your hair.
Defining Different Types 
of Hair Loss
How do you define hair loss? Do you consider you’re balding when
you’ve lost 5 hairs, 5,000, or 50,000? Can you slow the balding
process, stop it altogether, or should you just increase your base-
ball hat collection and live with it?

Hair falls out of your head every single day, at a rate of about 100
to 150 hairs if you are a Caucasian (Asians lose 80–120 per day and
Africans 60–100 per day). You aren’t going bald if your hair is
coming out at these rates because that is the rate that new hair
grows up from the scalp. If the hair that falls out isn’t replaced by
the same number of new hairs, then you have a balding problem.
Hair loss isn’t noticeable in the average person until more than 50
percent is lost, which is around 50,000 hairs, more or less.
Why does hair loss occur at all? You were born with your hair, and
by simple logic, you should die with it, right? Not one organ in the
human body dies as a natural course of aging, yet hair follicles
commit mass suicide over time. Other human organs may change
over time and become less functional, but they don’t disappear
altogether. Is hair loss a type of genetic adaptation? No one knows. 
This section looks at the different types and causes of hair loss,
including the cause of 99 percent of all cases of male balding: male
pattern baldness.
Telling the difference between
genetic baldness and everything else
There’s more than one category of hair loss. Can your doctor tell
just by looking at you what kind of hair loss you have? Yes, some-
times. Hereditary hair loss patterns, the most common type of hair
loss in men, have developed into a classical clinical descriptive sci-
ence. Genetic hair loss appears in distinct patterns, and these pat-
terns are almost 100-percent diagnostic for male pattern baldness.
The later section, “Norwood classifications for measuring male pat-
tern thinning” covers the most common baldness patterns. Also,
we discuss the types and causes of pattern balding in the later sec-
tion, “Common Causes of Hair Loss.”
In women, balding patterns also exist (see the section, “Genetic
hair loss in women,” later in this chapter), and a knowledgeable
doctor may be able to tell what’s causing the hair loss just by 
looking.
Examining uniform hair loss
A small segment of people lose scalp hair uniformly (diffusely),
rather than losing hair in specific scalp areas. Uniform hair loss
isn’t as easy to detect as other types of hair loss because the hair
is steadily lost all over the head. It’s much easier to detect a bald
spot resulting from hair loss in a specific area of the scalp from 
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
56

diseases that cause uniform hair loss to the normal genetics of that
particular person. 
Hair loss occurs normally and usually occurs at the end of one of
the normal hair cycles that all hair goes through. These hair cycles
are as follows:
 Anagen: The growth stage, which lasts three years on average
but may be as short as a year and as long as seven years).
 Catogen: The stage when the hair prepares to go into the next
phase and undergoes changes in its anatomy, falling out at the
end of this part of the cycle.
 Telogen: The sleep phase when a percentage of the hair disap-
pears (lasts from two to five months on average). About 10
percent of all of the hairs on our head are in the telogen part
of the cycle at any one time. 
At the end of the telogen phase, a new hair bud appears, signaling
the beginning of anagen. (Chapter 2 has more about hair growth
phases.)
The hair apparatus starts off producing a baby hair below the skin,
which grows longer and longer until the final terminal hair (a full
mature hair reflective of what we style every day when we comb
out hair) emerges from the pore in the skin. In some adults, the
anagen phase may never start, signaling that the hair follicle may
have died. If a new hair doesn’t grow to replace the lost hair, the
total hair count drops.
Hair grows in natural occurring groups called follicular units (FU). A
single FU contains from one to four terminal hairs and one vellus
hair (a fine hair amidst the clump of terminal hairs). When a hair
isn’t replaced after its telogen phase, the number of hairs in the FU
decreases, but the number of FUs remains the same. So an FU
starting with four terminal hairs may end up with only two or three
terminal hairs as we age or as we undergo some form of balding.
When this happens across the whole scalp, the total hair count
decreases proportionally.
The older the patient is, the more likely it is that doctors see this
uniform hair loss process. About one third of men over age 70 have
this diffuse hair loss, which is called senile alopecia. The name
doesn’t reflect the mental status of those afflicted, but rather it
essentially means that the condition is most common in the eld-
erly. Because hair also becomes finer with age, severe thinning
reflects a loss of both hair bulk (in each hair shaft) and hair densi-
ties. (For more on hair bulk and density, turn to Chapter 2.) There’s
no cure for senile alopecia.
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 57

Young men may experience uniform hair loss in the form of a con-
dition called diffuse unpatterned alopecia (DUPA). Doctors believe
that DUPA and senile alopecia are similar but for the age of occur-
rence. DUPA impacts men in their 20s and 30s and doesn’t seem to
be responsive to drugs used to treat the classic type of male pat-
terned hair loss. We cover treatment drugs in Chapter 9.
Identifying dying hair cells
Apoptosis is a cell’s internal “suicide” mechanism that causes cell
death. The phenomenon has recently been studied very carefully,
and what doctors know is that during the transition from anagen to
catagen (that’s the growth phase to the changing phase), some-
thing happens in the hair follicle development.
The cells within the hair follicles communicate with each other,
and certain chemicals secreted in the hair follicle determine which
hairs will survive for another growth cycle and which will die.
Experts believe that the lifespan of each hair follicle — and possi-
bly each follicular unit — is genetically programmed.
Because some of the hair follicles within the FU survive while
others die, there’s some hope that the chemical inducers that
determine the survivors can be identified and manipulated to pre-
vent hair loss. We have identified some of the molecules that stim-
ulate the process but others still need to be isolated. Maybe when
all of the molecules are identified and isolated, we can stop the
balding process from occurring. 
Saving dying hair cells
The causes of cell death are complex. Research has shown that the
cells that produce apoptosis-causing chemicals are found in every
part of the hair follicle. It’s possible that different types of hair loss
are influenced by different chemical problems in the pathways that
control cell death.
Although the medical community is identifying many of these
chemical pathways, it’s no closer to finding a cure for apoptosis
than we would like. Interestingly, apoptosis typically doesn’t occur
in cancerous cells, which are thought to be immortal, escaping
their natural destiny of living a given number of cell cycles. For
example, in breast cancer, a gene called BRCA causes the produc-
tion of a particular enzyme that blocks apoptosis. Imagine if it were
possible to bottle that enzyme to use on hair that’s dying off or,
even better, create a cocktail that could make all the cells in the
body immortal! At least we can dream.

Common Causes of Hair Loss
A number of diseases and conditions cause hair loss, but most
people go bald because of the influence of genetics, hormones, 
and time. Stress may cause additional loss, more so in women than
in men.
Looking at Grandpa’s head
In the genetic hair loss lottery, Grandpa’s important, but doctors
actually look a few generations back on the entire family tree —
men and women — in order to determine if you’ve inherited a
genetic type of pattern baldness.
Everyone inherits genetic tendencies from their parents. As you
may or may not recall from biology class, pairs of DNA segments
called chromosomes carry the information that contains the poten-
tial for different characteristics. A gene is a single bit of chemically
encoded hereditary instruction located on a chromosome.
The genetics of androgenetic alopecia (ANA), also called androge-
netic alopecia or male pattern baldness, is complicated. At least
four genes are responsible for hair loss. When several genes need
to be present for a trait such as hair loss, the trait is said to be
polygenic. Genes that are located on the X or Y chromosomes are
called sex-linked, and genes on the other 22 pairs of chromosomes
are called autosomal.
Currently, doctors believe that the genes governing common bald-
ness are autosomal (not tied to the sex chromosome) and there-
fore can be inherited from the mother’s or the father’s side of the
family. The commonly held notion that baldness comes only from
the mother’s side of the family is false, although for reasons not
fully understood, the predisposition inherited from an affected
mother is of slightly greater importance than that inherited from
an affected father. Doctors also believe that the genes involved in
androgenetic alopecia are dominant, meaning that only one gene of
a pair is needed for the trait to show up in the individual. So even if
only one of your parents passed on the baldness gene, you’re likely
to have some hair loss.
The inherited gene isn’t always ‘expressed,’ so it’s possible to
carry the gene for balding and never become bald. It can skip a
generation or two, so only looking at the generation before you
doesn’t tell you what may happen on your head.
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 59

The ability of a gene to affect you is called expressivity.Expressivity
occurs depending on a number of factors, the major ones being
hormones and age, although stress and other factors may also play
a role. Put simply, a man whose father and uncles are severely bald
may have minimal hair loss because the expression of the baldness
gene is limited. If you are confused by this explanation, imagine the
experts who try to clarify the unexplainable by putting together
the many variables and not coming up with a logical, scientific
process. 
The end goal of gene identification is to manipulate genes to pre-
vent or reverse common baldness. But doctors first need to find
and fully understand which genes cause the balding process and
why are these genes expressed one way in you and another way in
your brother.
Hormonal influences on hair
Hormones are very powerful biochemical substances produced by
various glands throughout the body. The primary male sex hor-
mone is testosterone. Testosterone and other related hormones
that have “masculinizing” effects are produced primarily in the tes-
ticles. These same hormones are the cause of many changes that
occur in puberty in boys. The hormones that cause acne and beard
growth also can trigger the beginning of baldness. Testosterone is
also produced in women from the adrenal glands and the ovaries,
and it is produced in lower concentrations than the testicles pro-
duce the hormone in men. In women, most of the testosterone is
converted into estrogen.
The hormone believed to be most directly involved in androge-
netic alopecia is dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is formed by the
action of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase (5AR) on testosterone, and
it binds to special receptor sites on the cells of hair follicles to
cause the specific changes associated with balding.
The presence of androgens (steroid like substances), testosterone
(considered an androgen), and DHT cause some hair follicles to
regress and die. In addition to the testicles, the adrenal glands
located above the kidneys produce androgenetic hormones; this is
true for both sexes. In females, ovaries are the major source of hor-
mones that can affect hair. Androgenetic hormones stimulate many
of the male sex characteristics we see in adult men. Androgens like
testosterone, are converted into estrogens in women, which make
women develop their typical female sex characteristics. 
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
60

Early in the 20th century, a psychiatrist discovered the specific
relationship between testosterone and hormone-induced hair loss.
The doctor noted that the identical twin brother of one patient was
profoundly bald while the mentally ill twin had a full head of hair.
The doctor decided to determine the effect of treating his patient
with testosterone, and injected him (the hairy twin) with the hor-
mone. Within weeks, the hairy patient began to lose all but his
wreath of permanent hair, just like his twin. The doctor stopped
administering testosterone, but his patient never regained his head
of hair.
Testosterone and DHT
The cause of pattern thinning in men is primarily related to two
sex hormones, testosterone and DHT. The body converts testos-
terone into the hormone DHT by way of an enzyme found in vari-
ous tissues throughout the body.
In men with the genes for ANA, DHT increases the resting (telogen)
phase and decreases the growing (anagen) phase of hair. (We
explain the growth cycle more in the earlier section, “Examining
uniform hair loss.”) Consequently, as a man ages, less hair grows at
any given time, and the hair starts to thin as a normal consequence
of aging, especially in men with ANA. Eventually, baldness occurs.
In men who haven’t inherited the ANA balding genes, the combina-
tion of DHT and testosterone doesn’t cause hair loss and may have
a lesser impact on aging hair. 
Some areas of the scalp are more susceptible than others to the
affects of DHT. For example, the hormone doesn’t usually affect
hair on the back and side of the head, which is why these areas
retain hair. The term “male pattern thinning” is used because hair
loss occurs in a pattern — the back and side of the head retain hair
but the crown and frontal areas may lose it. The loss may be con-
fined only to the frontal area or the crown area based upon the
genetics that are inherited from the family tree. 
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 61
Baring hair at the beach
The beach is an excellent place to observe hair patterns. Have you ever noticed
that men with hairy backs and shoulders often have a bald head or a hair replace-
ment system?
This indicates that the gene for hair on the back and shoulders is separate from the
gene for hair on the scalp. Although DHT acts like fertilizer for shoulder and back
hair, it causes reduction of head hair in many men.

DHT does play a role in the growth of beard hair; body hair; and
eyebrow, nose, and ear hair, but doctors don’t clearly understand
that role. Sometime after puberty, male hormones trigger a biologi-
cal clock that makes hair grow in these areas.
In men, the enzyme 5AR activity is higher in the balding area.
Women have half the amount of 5AR overall as compared to men
but have higher levels of the enzyme aromatase, especially in their
frontal hairlines. Aromatase decreases the formation of DHT, and
its presence in women may help to explain why female hair loss is
somewhat different than hair loss in males. (The section
“Examining Hair Thinning in Women” later in this chapter takes an
in-depth look at female hair loss.)
The only way to stop DHT is to block it with finasteride or dutas-
teride, drugs that interfere with DHT production. (See Chapter 9 for
more on DHT and the drugs that fight hair loss.)
At present, only finasteride has been approved by the Federal Drug
Administration (FDA). Dutasteride is still being evaluated for its
safety and effectiveness for hair loss in young men. There are some
reports that dutasteride has significant effects on male sperm pro-
duction; as such, it may not be approved for men experiencing hair
loss. Blocking DHT in women with dutasteride hasn’t been shown
to prevent or reverse female hair loss or hair thinning. Its safety
with regard to breast cancer, particularly in women who carry the
breast cancer producing BRCA genes, is not understood. 
Steroids and similar products
Anabolic steroids, the kind bodybuilders sometimes (illegally) use,
can cause hair loss if you’re genetically predisposed to it. And
there’s a direct link between taking human growth hormone (HGH)
and hair loss — probably caused by the same underlying mecha-
nisms as steroid use. Women body builders who take steroids
develop some male sex characteristics and some experience hair
loss.
HGH has become a trendy anti-aging tool. More and more men are
using it as a fountain of youth. Some men combine steroids and
HGH because they make them feel better and stronger. But we have
seen many men on HGH in our offices with “unexplained hair loss.”
No real mystery there.
Many men who take steroids also take Propecia (a DHT blocker) to
offset the negative effects of DHT. Propecia blocks DHT and causes
a rise in systemic testosterone by up to 18 percent. Indirectly,
Propecia may help muscle building if DHT levels go down (from the
Propecia) and testosterone levels go up to compensate.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
62

Testosterone is a much stronger hormone than DHT, and the sum
of the effects of the rise in serum testosterone from taking a DHT
blocker such as Propecia and the steroids may very well produce
more hair loss, not less.
Everyone is different, so we can’t conclude if the muscle mass that
the men are seeking from steroid use can be offset. Recently,
Propecia was found to mask the blood measurements for other
steroids when used in athletes, which is why its use is banned for
professional athletes.
Fitness-focused individuals may take the following products for
their physical benefits, but these products can also cause hair loss:
 Whey-based nutritional supplements: The use of growth hor-
mones in some dairy cows affects the milk they produce and,
in turn, the whey (a byproduct of cheese production). Even if
a person doesn’t take steroids, these products may have some
steroid-like impact from the milk source. People who take
whey-based nutritional supplements may experience steroid-
related side effects if the cows were treated with steroids. It is
unclear how much of these steroids, if any, will survive transit
through the stomach to be eventually absorbed into the body. 
 DHEA: Some people take DHEA, which is found in the nutri-
tional section of many health food and vitamin stores and
doesn’t require a prescription. The DHEA sold in stores is
reportedly made by the adrenal glands and claims to help
reduce body fat stores while promoting sugar metabolism. It
also can cause hair loss. Other available supplements claim
testosterone or steroid-like characteristics. The desire for
men to add body mass and/or prevent hair loss drives them
to seek out such products.
 Dose-pack steroids: A short course of steroids for medical
reasons (4–5 days) should not have an impact producing 
hair loss.
 Prednisone: People who are on this steroid for chronic med-
ical problems (arthritis, various autoimmune diseases) will
experience hair loss.
Hair loss is also a risk for women who use steroids, if they’re pre-
disposed to the condition. Women usually take steroids for dis-
eases that occur later in life, such as autoimmune disease,
temporal arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis.
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 63

Hair loss over time
The mere presence of the necessary genes and hormones for hair
loss isn’t enough to cause baldness. Susceptible hair follicles also
have to be exposed to the responsible hormones. The onset of hair
loss varies from one individual to another and is influenced by
genetic expression, the levels of testosterone and DHT in the
bloodstream, and age.
Hair loss doesn’t occur all at once, but is cyclical. People who are
losing their hair experience alternating periods of slow hair loss
and rapid hair loss, and even periods when hair loss stabilizes. The
factors that cause the rate of loss to speed up or slow down are
unknown.
Most men who have extensive balding develop much of it by age
30. Twenty-five percent of men will show clinical balding by age 30,
and half of the male population will show some degree of clinical
balding by age 45 to 50. Balding slowly continues into the next
decade or two, and then the process seems to slow down as men
approach 60 to 65. As this is a genetic process, it is probable that
the men who bald later in life rather than earlier also have a form
of genetic hair loss, just not the obvious process we see in the
younger men with classic pattern balding. 
Men who continue the balding process well into their 30s and 40s
typically don’t lose their hair as quickly or as completely as men
who start balding in their early 20s. About 7 percent of men who
are balding develop the most complete form of balding (called the
Class VII pattern; see Figure 4-1), in which only the wreath of hair
exists around the head. Those men with Class VII balding patterns,
usually show those patterns before they reach 30 years old. This
wreath of hair is permanent hair in most men and measures about
21⁄2 inches in the mid-back of the head when the balding process
reaches completion. Most men who show balding don’t advance to
full balding.
To make matters more confusing, the age of onset discussed above
reflects the majority of men, yet there are still some men who start
the process later in life (in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s).
The most common balding patterns are seen at the frontal hairline
where frontal and temporal recession occurs, moving slightly
upward toward the top of the head. A bald spot may appear in the
crown and when it does, it seems to widen slowly as men age.
Sometimes, the crown balding area merges with the frontal reces-
sion, clearing a wide bald channel in the center of the head that we
jokingly call the “runway.” Genetics determine the final pattern.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
64

Stress
When the body experiences stress caused by a traumatic experi-
ence, nutritional deficiency, or illness, the rate of hair loss can
increase. For example, a 39-year-old patient of Dr. Rassman lost his
4-year-old child to cancer and within just a few months, the man lost
all but the permanent wreath of hair around his head. He probably
had the genetics for this balding pattern, but only expressed that
pattern when it was induced by this extreme stressful situation. 
Women’s hair seems to be more sensitive to the effects of stress
than men’s hair. This may be because women with a genetic predis-
position to hair loss usually have a higher percentage of fragile
miniaturized hair, which is hair with thinner than normal hair shaft
thickness. But unlike in men, the hair loss in women is often not
permanent or complete.
Stress generally causes a type of hair loss referred to as telogen
effluvium, which is very different from androgenetic alopecia (dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter). Telogen effluvium is the reversible
shedding of hair in the resting phase when the body senses, for
reasons that are not clear, that it needs to divert its energies.
Therefore, stress temporarily changes the amount of hair that’s
shed, but the lost hair is likely to grow back. Turn to Chapter 5 for
more explanation of telogen effluvium.
Lack of blood supply
Some doctors assert that a lack of blood supply contributes to hair
loss. Bald skin gradually loses some of its blood supply and as a
result becomes thin and shiny. These changes, however, come only
after the loss of hair and is not the cause of the hair loss.
Hair follicles are some of the most rapidly metabolizing cells in the
body. Growing hair requires the proper oxygen and nutrition that
comes with a good blood supply in a healthy body. When hair folli-
cles are transplanted into skin grafts or scar tissue, both of which
may have a relatively poor blood supply, the presence of the
grafted hair causes the local blood supply to increase. The end
result is that as the hair grows, so does the blood supply.
Environmental issues
Can you eat yourself into a full head of hair? Probably not, but envi-
ronmental factors, including what you eat, can cause hair loss. The
following list breaks down some of the more prominent factors:
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 65

 Selenium: The presence of selenium in food and water is
common around the world, but continued intake of selenium
to the point of selenium toxicity produces hair loss, among
other effects. 
 Lead, cadmium, mercury, iron, aluminum, and copper:
These are the most common environmental causes of hair
loss. Many of these substances are found in fish, reflecting
environmental contamination in the world’s oceans. Lead may
also be found in hair dyes and paint. Just how much of these
elements must be present to cause hair loss is unknown, and
a direct connection is hard to prove. Some labs will analyze
hair for the presence of these minerals, but their presence
doesn’t necessarily mean they caused hair loss.
 Air pollution and smoking: These factors may also exacer-
bate the genetic process carried by potentially balding men.
Scientists believe toxins and carcinogens found in polluted air
can stop hair growing by blocking the mechanisms that pro-
duce the protein from which hair is made.
Doctors hope that science will discover ways to treat pollu-
tant contributions to hair loss with topical lotions to block the
effects of the pollutants on the hair follicles.
Looking at Male Pattern Thinning
Pattern thinning is a specific kind of hair loss that occurs gradually
over time. Both men and women can experience pattern thinning,
but they experience it differently. In men, pattern thinning some-
times goes by the scientific name androgenetic alopecia (ANA). You
hear a lot about ANA, as it’s the most common reason for hair loss
in men. Easily 98 percent of men who are balding have ANA.
Men with ANA usually first notice a thinning or receding hairline in
the front at a fairly young age. The pattern progresses to thinning
on the crown of the head that may slowly thin over a decade or
more. The pattern thinning process tends to begin during early or
mid-20s, possibly with some thinning in the teen years, but until
the thinning reduces the hair density by 50 percent most of it goes
unnoticed.
For the man with patterned hair loss, general areas thin but may
not become completely bald initially. Over many years, the hair
loss can progress to complete balding, but it’s also possible that
total loss of hair may not occur.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
66

Male hair loss starts when hair shafts grow thinner in a process
called miniaturization. As fewer hairs remain after shedding starts,
men notice, especially in bright light, that their hair has a “see-
through” look. They generally start off denying what they are
seeing, and then eventually panic sets in.
Early evidence of pattern thinning
Because male pattern thinning is a genetic condition, a man who
comes from a family with many bald members is more likely to be
on the lookout for baldness symptoms than a man from a family
with full heads of hair. However, because of the nature of ANA,
genetics can play tricks on men.
In some families, balding isn’t transmitted to the offspring, while in
families with full heads of hair, the genes for balding may lie dor-
mant in one generation and then just appear in the next. All too
often, a young man can’t believe that he’s balding because he can’t
find relatives on either side of the family with balding; the reverse is
also true — a man with a full head of hair may see extensive balding
in his family line. It’s just a role of the genetic dice, we suspect.
Nine out of ten times, men first discover that they’re shedding
when their shower or bathtub drains get clogged with hair.
Regardless of details of the discovery, they may adopt a different
hairstyle to cover the signs of hair loss. Some men may abandon
combing their hair straight back and adopt a side-to-side combing
style that more easily hides thinning hair, continuing this sleight of
hand to a point when even this style doesn’t cut it. Some men just
comb their hair forward so that no one can see what’s happening
to the front of the head. Look at Rudolf Giuliani and John
McCain, who use comb-overs as their slight of hand that is not as
slight as they think. 
Some men are all too aware of their family’s balding problem. They
may have teased their father or older brothers about their balding,
but it’s not so funny when it happens to them.
Those who look for signs of balding or thinning have the opportu-
nity to catch it early. Despite the drug company Merck’s promotion
of Propecia, many men are unaware that hair loss can be slowed,
stopped, or possibly reversed if they take this drug early enough in
the pattern thinning process. Treatment can be very successful if
the diagnosis is made when the hair loss first become evident,
hopefully before substantial thinning has occurred.
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 67

The only way to determine if you’re at the very beginning of the
balding process is to get your hair and scalp mapped out for minia-
turization, which is always present when the balding process
starts. Mapping requires the use of a video microscope, which
examines the hairs all over your head for miniaturization.
As experts in this field, we believe very strongly that if a man is
concerned that he may develop hair loss, he should see a doctor
to map the scalp hair for the frequency and distribution of minia-
turized hairs. Even early pattern thinning corresponds to the 
balding patterns seen in the Norwood Classification Chart (see
Figure 4-1), so doctors can predict the eventual hair loss pattern
early on. Annual scalp hair mapping can detect the earliest signs 
of genetic hair loss before balding can be detected by the naked
eye. It can also follow the benefits or lack thereof, of the treat-
ments for balding.
For men, the drug Propecia can be effective at stopping the balding
process or at least slowing it down. Unfortunately for women,
there’s no comparable drug other than Minoxidil, which works
only in a small percentage of women.
Norwood classifications for 
measuring male pattern thinning
Most people think that bald is just plain bald, but doctors measure
male pattern thinning by degrees using the Norwood classification
system. Dr. O’Tar Norwood devised this classification system in
the 1970s, answering the all-important question, “How bald am I?”
Norwood provides two classification systems, one for regular male
pattern thinning and one for Type A pattern thinning.
Regular male pattern thinning
Figure 4-1 shows the Norwood classification system for regular
male pattern thinning. Under the regular classifications, hair loss 
is divided into seven patterns. Men may progress from one pattern
to the next, or they may develop any one of these patterns all at
once as the hair in that pattern thins to complete baldness in the
pattern identified on the chart.
The majority of men with pattern thinning follow the regular 
pattern, with hair loss starting in the front and progressing slowly
(front and back) in two different areas (Class IV and V). On rare
occasions, a man may just bald in the crown with minimal frontal
balding (Class III Vertex). Over time, the frontal and crown areas
enlarge and merge, and the entire front, top, and crown of the head
may become bald (Class VI or VII).
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
68

Figure 4-1: Norwood’s classification of regular male pattern thinning.
Baldness in some men progresses such that they fall somewhere
between the different stages; in other men, hair loss comes to a
halt, and they remain in one stage without progressing to the next.
Although there’s no general agreement on the statistics for the fre-
quency of balding, it’s believed that advanced balding (defined as a
Norwood Class V, VI, or VII pattern) occurs in about 35 percent of
balding men.
In 95 percent of men, the 1⁄2 inch of hair on the front of the forehead
is lost in the younger years, and the hairline recedes into a mature
male hairline (somewhere between a Class II or III pattern) with a
characteristic convex V-shape. This change from the concave juve-
nile hairline (also a typical female pattern hairline) to the convex
mature male hairline is common and not necessarily a sign of
oncoming baldness.
Balding starts at Class III in the Norwood regular classification
system (see Figure 4-1). The juvenile hairline is found in all pre-
pubertal boys, whereas a mature hairline appears in 95 percent of
Caucasian men ages 18 to 29.

Here’s an easy test to find out if your hairline is in its mature posi-
tion: Lift your eyebrows high and check the distance between the
highest crease on your forehead (in the middle) and the beginning
of your hairline:
 If your hairline touches the highest crease, it’s in the juvenile
position.
 If your hairline is 1⁄3 to 2⁄3 inch away from the highest crease,
it’s a mature male hairline.
 If your hairline is more than 2⁄3 inch from the highest crease,
you have frontal balding.
A very small percentage of men keep their juvenile hairlines for
many years (former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton are
examples of the lucky few). Some men have a persistent forelock,
thick hair at the central front of the forehead that remains despite
pattern thinning or balding around it — like an oasis in the desert
(talk-show host David Letterman is one example). The frontal fore-
lock doesn’t appear to be subject to the ravages of DHT (refer to
the earlier section, “Hormonal influences on hair” for an explana-
tion of DHT), and the frontal hair tends to retain its thickness
much like the hair on the sides and back of the head.
Unusual genetics: There appears to be a different genetics in 
some parts of the head in some people. The 2⁄3rd inch of the juvenile
hairline and the frontal forelock have, in some people, genetics
that do not reflect the rest of the frontal part of the head. On rare
occasions, we have seen men lose all of their hair in front and on
the top except for the frontal 2⁄3rd inch of hair (just as they had it at
the age of 12). This pattern looks strange and each man that pre-
sented with this unique pattern of balding tended to exploit the
frontal 2⁄3rd inch by letting it grow out 6–10 inches in length to comb
back over their balding head. 
Type A pattern thinning
The set of figures in Figure 4-2 shows Type A pattern thinning.
Type A thinning is less common than the regular pattern covered
in the preceding section, occurring in less than 10 percent of men.
In this pattern, hair loss progresses from the front to the back, pos-
sibly reaching the crown of the head and stopping about where the
swirl exists. Type A pattern thinning is most dramatic in front, and
for that reason, Type A men tend to look quite bald even though
their hair loss is minimal. Actor Gene Hackman showed the Class A
pattern balding for most of his career, and as one followed him in
films, his balding pattern creeped from front to back in the 
classic A pattern.

Evolutionary theories for male 
pattern baldness
Can male pattern baldness be explained by sexual selection? In other words, are
males programmed to go bald in order to attract females? Scientists have suggested
that, in primitive societies, an enlarged forehead may have conveyed increased
maturity and social status — traits that historically have made men more attractive
to women.
In Sex, Time, and Power: How Women’s Sexuality Shaped Human Evolution, (2004),
author Leonard Shlain suggests that bald men made the best hunters in primitive,
hunter-gatherer societies. Thanks to their lack of hair, bald men could peer over the
bush and spy game animals without the animals’ recognizing them as men and flee-
ing. Being better hunters, the bald men were better providers, which made them
more attractive to women.
This theory is certainly something to think about when you notice your hair thinning:
Women may instinctively like it more than you think.

Examining Hair Thinning 
in Women
Women are generally more attentive to the appearance of their hair
and notice the see-through quality of thinning hair early on. Most
women with thinning hair don’t lose enough all at once to clog the
drain, so problems with styling may be the first sign of the female
genetic balding process. This is fortunate because the slow onset
of thinning allows women to adjust their styling to compensate for
their hair loss.
Most women are able to conceal thinning with a new hairstyle, up
to a point. Layering, a pulled-back style like a pony tail, or a bun
can hide thinning hair fairly well. Or women can use hair exten-
sions or other hair systems, which we discuss in Chapters 6 and 7.
Regardless of how well they may be able to hide it, hair loss is a
psychological challenge for women who fondly remember the lus-
cious, thick hair of their youth and see it coming out in bunches on
their hairbrushes. Thinning hair can make a woman feel older and
less sexy.
This section looks at genetic female pattern hair loss and other
causes of women’s hair loss.
Differentiating between 
possible causes
There are a number of types of identifiable hair loss in women, and
they differ based on their causes. The cause of female hair loss is
reflected in the pattern, so doctors look to the pattern of loss to
get an idea of the cause and how to treat it.
About 10 percent of women experience the classic pattern of
genetic hair loss, which is an intact frontal hairline for the first 
2⁄3 inch or so and hair loss behind that persistent hairline. Another
recognizable pattern of genetic hair loss in women is hair loss con-
fined to the top of the head, sparing the leading frontal edge of the
hair line. Some women with genetic hair loss experience a diffuse
hair loss, which is a thinning of the hair all over the head (includ-
ing the sides and back of the head) and isn’t confined to any partic-
ular area. This is more common in postmenopausal women,
although it does show up in younger women as well.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
72

Perimenopausal women frequently experience pattern thinning
that’s usually worse in the front of the thinning area, about 2 to 3
inches behind the hairline. Over time, it progresses as far back as
the swirl (the place in the crown where hair changes direction and
produces a vortex); the thinning areas may spare the sides and
back of the head. For perimenopausal women, thinning tends to be
diagnosed in the 30s or 40s. It is present but less frequent with
women in the 20s. The good news is that once the thinning is rec-
ognized in these women it is generally stable over time and does
not show the progressive nature of the male balding patterns, at
least until they reach menopause. 
On the other hand, an advanced presentation of uniform hair loss,
called diffuse unpatterned alopecia (DUPA), leads doctors to narrow
the type of hair loss down to a few distinct possibilities, including
female genetic hair loss or senile alopecia.
Generalized thinning isn’t always genetic, and women should
undergo a complete medical examination including a wide variety
of laboratory tests. (We touch on these tests in this chapter in the
section “Medical causes of female hair loss” and in detail in
Chapter 5.)
Genetic hair loss in women
In women, there’s a distinct relationship between mother, sisters,
aunts, and grandmothers when it comes to thinning hair patterns.
When we take a careful history from women with thinning hair, far
more than half of the women we interview with balding or thinning
have female relatives with a similar problem. When one recognizes
this in the family history, we generally ask these women to inquire
on the course of the family balding patterns from a timeline 
perspective.
Genetic hair loss is relatively uncommon in women and is generally
referred to as female pattern hair loss or female androgenetic alope-
cia. In women with this condition, the common pattern differs than
that of men. Whereas the pattern in men follows the Norwood clas-
sification (refer to the earlier section, “Norwood classifications for
measuring male pattern thinning”), the postmenopausal pattern in
women is characterized by diffuse thinning starting just behind a
normal hairline and extending to and beyond the swirl.
Unlike men, adult women with typical female postmenopausal
androgenetic alopecia often have significant levels of miniaturiza-
tion (decreased hair shaft thickness in some hairs and loss of hairs
within the follicular unit) in the back and side of the scalp.
Chapter 4: Types of Hair Loss & Pattern Thinning in Men and Women 73

Miniaturization causes hair shafts to become thinner over time
before falling out, and the higher degree of miniaturization present
indicates an unstable hair loss process throughout the scalp.
In some women, the genetic pattern of hair loss is associated with
an increase in male sex hormones (androsterone, testosterone, and
DHT), but in most cases of genetic hair loss, it occurs when the sex
hormone levels are normal.
Compared to men, the mechanism of balding in women is less well
understood because their hair loss isn’t as directly related to the
presence of DHT. The enzyme aromatase appears to have a role in
causing female hair loss and may partially explain the different pat-
tern when compared to men. The loss of estrogens in post-
menopausal women means that the protection against female
genetic alopecia is withdrawn, bringing on the thinning.
Women who develop pattern balding later in life also have a
genetic component to their hair loss, but the association is less
strong. The changes in hormones that occur around menopause
are an obvious contributing factor.
Because genetic hair loss presents itself differently in women than
in men, a different classification system is used. Doctors use the
Ludwig classification to describe the thinning that women experi-
ence. A Ludwig type I is associated with a mild widening of the part
width. Patients who fall into type II have increased thinning with
moderate widening of the part. Type III patients have significant
widening of the part width. Figure 4-3 depicts types I through III.
A minority of women develop pattern balding in a distribution
that’s similar to men. These patients are better classified using the
Norwood classification system. Because these women have hair
loss mainly limited to the front and top of the scalp that doesn’t
affect the back and sides, they may be candidates for hair trans-
plant surgery, which we discuss in Chapter 13. About 15 percent of
women have this patterned balding.
Medical causes of female hair loss
Apart from genetics, female hair loss can stem from a variety of
medical causes. This section looks at those causes, from the gen-
eral to the more specific, including postpartum and menopausal
hair loss.

74

Underlying medical conditions
In women, many medical conditions may cause hair loss, including
the following:
 Thyroid disease
 Anemia
 Iron deficiency
 Weight loss induced by severe dieting or eating disorders
 Medication use (particularly oral contraceptives, beta-blockers,
vitamin A, thyroid drugs, tranquilizers and sedatives, Coumadin,
and prednisone)
 A variety of autoimmune diseases

hair loss.

As a woman experiencing hair loss, you should first be evaluated
by a dermatologist to make sure that no underlying skin conditions
are contributing to the hair loss. They may require a treatment dif-
ferent and may require a biopsy to rule out the presence of certain
skin diseases like diffuse alopecia areata. Your family doctor can
do the required blood tests for the various diseases that may be
present. Dermatologists are the best to hone in on a diagnosis. 
Blood tests check the following common contributors to female
hair loss and can help rule out some identifiable medical 
conditions:
 ANA (antinuclear antibody): Used to test for lupus or other
autoimmune diseases. This test is either positive or negative
and further testing may be required if the initial screening
tests are positive.
 Iron: Levels serum iron, TIBC (total iron binding capacity),
and ferritin deficiencies in iron. 
 Estradiol: This sex hormone indicates the status of ovarian
output.
 FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone): This sex hormone indi-
cates the status of ovarian output. This hormone reflects the
status of a woman’s ability to ovulate. 
 LH (luteinizing hormone): This is a sex hormone indicates
the status of ovarian outputa woman may be in her overall
aging process. When she ovulates, this hormone stimulates
the production of eggs.
 Free testosterone: May help the doctor understand a
woman’s ability to convert testosterone into estrogen. Most
testosterone is bound to proteins in the blood and the free
testosterone is easily converted into estrogen. 
 SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin): Level indicates the
status of male hormones.
 TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone): Level indicates the pres-
ence of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
 Total testosterone: Largely bound to proteins in the blood. 
It’s important to note that even after a medical condition has been
corrected, your hair loss may still persist perhaps because of a
“switch” in your genetic makeup that’s turned on when the medical
insult occurs. After the hair loss starts, it may be difficult to turn
off this switch. The hope is that your hair loss will slow down after
your medical condition is treated or cured and any deficiency of
your overall hormone balance is corrected.

76

Baby blues: Postpartum hair loss
Pregnancy alters a woman’s overall hormone configuration in
many different ways. When hormones change, hair becomes a
target organ for change in some (but not all) women because the
rapid growth of the hair cells reflects changes in the overall hor-
monal environment in the woman’s body.
When you’re pregnant, your production of the sex hormone estro-
gen increases, which prolongs the growth (anagen) phase of the
hair cycle. During pregnancy, many women are delighted to dis-
cover that their hair is thicker and more lush. After the baby is
born, however, estrogen levels drop and more hair lapses into the
resting (telogen) phase. Consequently, your growing hair may fall
out, and because the resting cycle lasts two to six months, it may
take time to see the hair return to its growth phase.
Because hair grows at about 1⁄2 inch per month and doesn’t start
growing again until the rest cycle is complete, it can take up to a
year for you to get your “old” hair back. In that period, you may
think you’re going bald; don’t worry, you aren’t. In nursing moms,
the resting period can take longer than a year, and it may take
more than a year for hair growth to return to previous levels.
Anemia and hypothyroidism also can contribute to postpartum
hair loss. You can find out more about these medical conditions
and others in Chapter 9.
Menopause-related hair loss
Over 50 percent of women going through the hormone fluctuations
associated with menopause experience significant hair loss. The
drop in estrogen levels in postmenopausal women may put the
hair in a prolonged resting phase; this phase is particularly impor-
tant for those women who have inherited female genetic hair loss.
Unfortunately, doctors don’t really understand the mechanisms by
which the withdrawal of estrogen causes hair loss in women, but
they know that it occurs. Women who lose estrogen support have
many changes in their bodies, of which hair is only one. There are
books written on the use of hormone supplements for managing
menopausal changes in the body, and this book is not meant to
deal with these complex issues.

A
lthough the most common cause of hair loss in adults is pat-
tern thinning, it’s not the only cause. A number of medical
conditions can cause alopecia, the medical term for hair loss.
Alopecia can occur as a disease in which hair loss is the predomi-
nant feature, or it may be a side effect from a disease or treatment
of disease, such as alopecia caused by chemotherapy drugs.
Alopecia breaks down into two main categories, non-scarring and
scarring. If properly treated, a non-scarring disorder can subside
and hair can potentially grow back. With a scarring hair loss disor-
der, the hair follicles are permanently damaged; the chances of
hair regrowth after the disorder is treated are very slight.
This chapter looks at the common medical causes of alopecia and
their causes, courses, and cures.

Without a Trace: Non-scarring
Alopecia
Non-scarring hair loss disorders are generally reversible, but that
doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t take them seriously. Here, we
describe some of the most common causes of non-scarring hair
loss, their symptoms, and their treatments.
Seeing circular bald spots: 
Alopecia areata
As if there aren’t already enough difficult-to-pronounce terms in
this book, here’s another one: alopecia areata. Also called AA,
alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss
(see the sidebar “What’s an autoimmune disease?”). AA is some-
times called spot baldness because it causes round spots of hair
loss. The disease, which is relatively common, tends to run in fami-
lies and affects about 1 to 2 percent of the population in the United
States. In about 2 percent of patients, the disease changes into a
more diffuse form of hair loss, covering wider areas of the scalp.
Alopecia areata occurs when a person’s white blood cells attack
and destroy the body’s hair follicles. After hair follicles are
attacked, they stop producing hair, causing the distinctive local-
ized bald patches that are the mark of alopecia areata. The hair
loss usually occurs over a short period of time.
Severe alopecia areata can take two forms:
 Alopecia totalis: All hair on the scalp is lost.
 Alopecia universalis: All hair on the scalp is lost, along with
hair on the eyebrows, eyelashes, and all other parts of the
body.
Less severe alopecia areata can take these forms:
 Alopecia areata monolocularis: Baldness occurs in only one
place on the scalp.
 Alopecia areata barbae: Hair loss occurs in patches in a
man’s beard.
AA can occur at any age, with most patients diagnosed between
the ages of 15 and 29 and nearly half being under age 20. An equal
number of men and women develop AA, and the disease occurs
equally in every race.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
80

Diagnosing the disorder
Alopecia areata doesn’t follow a predictable path. Some patients
feel burning or itching in the area of balding, but others don’t.
Eighty percent of patients have only one bald spot. The bald
patches can be round or oval in shape, and expose smooth, bald
skin.
The disease normally affects only the scalp, but other body hair
also can be affected and aid in diagnosing the condition.
Interestingly, if you have fingernail abnormalities such as small pits
on the nail plate, you may also have alopecia areata. Atopic der-
matitis (an allergic skin condition) and vitiligo, a disease that
causes white patches on the skin, are also more common in people
with AA.
An important diagnostic clue to alopecia areata is the presence of
“exclamation point hairs” on the perimeter of the bald patch.
These hairs form as the body attacks the lower portion of the hair
follicle, and the damage produces a finely tapered end. As the hair
continues to grow, it looks like a tiny spear stuck in the scalp.
Eventually this hair will be lost, but its presence is a sign of alope-
cia areata in its active stage.
Your doctor may gently pull hair along the edge of a bald patch to
determine whether you have alopecia areata. Healthy hair doesn’t
come out when pulled gently, but hair afflicted with alopecia areata
is easily removed.
Exploring treatment options
If you’re diagnosed with alopecia areata, the good news is that in
90 percent of cases, hair grows back on its own and no treatment is
needed. The chances of regrowth are best when the condition is
localized to just a few places on the scalp and the patient is over
age 40. In younger patients, unfortunately, the condition tends to
be more severe. If the disease progresses to alopecia totalis or
alopecia universalis (refer to the earlier section, “Seeing circular
bald spots: Alopecia areata”), no surefire treatment is available.
Options for treatment include:
 Steroids: One of the main functions of steroids is to reduce
inflammation, but in patients with AA, steroids are used to
stop the body’s immune cells from destroying hair follicles.
Your doctor may inject steroids directly into your bald
patches or may prescribe a topical steroid cream that you can
apply to the bald patches at home.
Chapter 5: Diseases that Cause Hair Loss 81

When the disease is too extensive to treat with multiple injec-
tions or topical creams, oral steroids are an option. Usually,
you only take them for a short period of time because of the
many side effects of long-term use, including osteoporosis,
very fragile skin, and diabetes.
 Minoxidil: This medicine works because hair growth is a side
effect of the drug that may directly affect bald spots. You
apply it directly to the bald patches. Minoxidil is commonly
used to treat pattern baldness, but for unknown reasons it
also sometimes helps patients with AA.
 Cyclosporine: This potent immunosuppressant specifically
inhibits T cells, the immune system cells that attack hair folli-
cles in AA. Cyclosporine is most often given orally. It’s more
commonly used to treat other conditions such as psoriasis,
and many physicians are hesitant to use it medicine to treat
AA because it can cause kidney damage, high blood pressure,
and suppress your body’s immune system.
 DNCB: This chemical (full name dinitrochioro benzene) rapidly
produces skin sensitivity. In some people with severe alopecia
areata, continued application of DNCB (enough to produce a
continuing rash caused by the activation of white blood cells
to boost the local immune function). This caused hair
regrowth in some individuals. It doesn’t always work, how-
ever. You should take DNCB only under the strict supervision
of a doctor who’s experienced with this treatment.

82
What’s an autoimmune disease?
Three diseases that can cause hair loss — alopecia areata, scleroderma, and lupus
— are autoimmune diseases. But what is an autoimmune disease?
Your body’s immune system serves to protect it from outside invaders, such as harm-
ful bacteria and viruses. With an autoimmune disease, your immune system turns
on itself and starts attacking components of your body. In other words, your body
mistakenly thinks that some of its own cells are foreign, disease-causing cells, and
so it attacks and tries to kill or damage those cells. Autoimmune diseases result
from a failure of the immune system to distinguish between which cells belong in
your body and which cells don’t belong.
The cause of autoimmune diseases remains a mystery. They may have a genetic
component because they tend to run in families. They’re also much more common
in women than in men, but doctors and researchers continue to hunt for the exact
cause.

Hair today, gone tomorrow: 
Telogen effluvium
Telogen effluvium is a type of non-scarring hair loss characterized
by sudden, widespread hair shedding. Normally, people lose 100 to
150 hairs each day, but you can lose more than 400 or more hairs
daily with telogen effluvium! This disease can occur at any age and
may be more common in women because of hormonal changes in
menopause. It occurs equally in different races.
Telogen effluvium occurs when a large number of hair follicles sud-
denly decide to take a rest at the same time (the telogen phase; see
Chapter 2 for more on the hair cycle). Then, three to four months
later, this formerly resting hair sheds as new hair begins to take its
place.
Why does a large portion of hair suddenly enter the resting phase
and bring about an attack of telogen effluvium? Usually a traumatic
event causes the condition (see the following list for some exam-
ples). Essentially, in times of stress, the body diverts its energies to
something other than growing hair. As a result, the hair goes into a
resting stage until the traumatic event subsides. The problem is
that after the trauma, the hair can’t just start growing again. It first
has to be shed, and then you have to wait for new hair to grow in.
Common causes of telogen effluvium include the following:
 An acute illness accompanied by high fever
 A chronic illness, such as cancer
 Hormonal changes brought about by childbirth or stopping
birth control
 Sudden changes in diet, including the conditions anorexia and
bulimia
 Medications, such as those used to treat high blood pressure,
cholesterol, and seizures
 Major surgery and general anesthesia
 Big life changes such as a divorce, death in the family, or loss
of a job
People with telogen effluvium often seek help from a physician
because the shedding is so sudden. Doctors often diagnose telogen
effluvium with a hair pull test; pulling out significantly more than
10 percent of the hair indicates telogen effluvium in its early stage.
The condition can be either acute, lasting less than six months, or
chronic, lasting longer than six months. But there’s some good
Chapter 5: Diseases that Cause Hair Loss 83

news for telogen effluvium sufferers: After the hairs fall out, they
start growing again, so hair loss from telogen effluvium usually
isn’t permanent. Be patient and your hair will grow back.
The fungus among us: Tinea capitis
By far the most common reason for hair loss in children is a fungal
infection of the scalp called tinea capitis. This condition is rarely
seen in adults. Depending on the severity of the infection, it can
appear as a mild case of dandruff; reddened, circular areas of com-
plete hair loss on the scalp that show whitish, scaly flakes; or a
massive blister that covers the whole scalp. Often the infection is
accompanied by swollen lymph nodes under the ear and on the
back of the neck.
Outbreaks of tinea capitis aren’t uncommon in schools. Doctors
can make a definitive diagnosis by taking a fungal culture of the
hair or looking at the hair under a microscope and noting the tiny
fungal branches. The infection is treated with oral antifungal medi-
cine usually taken for a period of several months.
When the infection is mild and treated early, any lost hair is
expected to regrow. When the condition is associated with a lot of
inflammation, scarred patches may form that are permanently
devoid of hair. In this case, the condition should be viewed as a
type of scarring alopecia (see the later section, “Scarring
Conditions That Cause Hair Loss”).
Thyroid conditions and hair loss
The thyroid is a small gland that resides on the front of your neck.
It controls how your body makes proteins and burns energy; it also
regulates your metabolism through production of thyroid hor-
mone. Diseases of the thyroid gland can affect hair growth, which
fortunately is non-scarring.
Diseases of the thyroid gland
When the thyroid gland produces either too much or too little thy-
roid hormone, it can have negative consequences for your hair.
Fortunately, the following thyroid gland diseases can be detected
with a simple blood test:
 Hyperthyroidism: When the body produces too much thyroid
hormone, you may develop hyperthyroidism. Symptoms of
hyperthyroidism include a rapid heartbeat, weight loss, heat
intolerance, and nervousness. In addition, your hair becomes
extremely thin and sparse.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
84

 Hypothyroidism: When the body produces too little thyroid
hormone, you may develop hypothyroidism. Symptoms of
hypothyroidism include fatigue, cold intolerance, lack of
energy, puffiness of the face, and dry skin. In addition, your
hair becomes dry, brittle, coarse, and sparse.
The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the U.S. is Grave’s
disease, an autoimmune disease (see the earlier sidebar “What’s an
autoimmune disease?”). The most common cause of hypothy-
roidism in the U.S. is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, also an autoimmune
disease. In developing countries, lack of iodine in the diet is the
most common cause of hypothyroidism. However, this cause is
rare in the United States because iodine is added to table salt.
How thyroid conditions affect hair growth
Doctors aren’t sure why patients with thyroid disease lose their
hair. It could be because the thyroid hormone affects the body’s
metabolism, including the hair follicles, and so problems with the
hormone cause hair regrowth to slow and hair to become thinner
and possibly more brittle. This may result in loss of hair bulk. And
if the hair shaft hasn’t fully developed, the ends of the hair may
split.
Whether or not the thyroid hormone has a direct effect on the con-
dition of hair and its growth, acute thyroid disease is very stress-
ful. As we explain in the section, “Hair today, gone tomorrow:
Telogen effluvium,” earlier in this chapter, stress can be an impor-
tant factor in developing telogen effluvium, in which hair rapidly
falls out after prematurely entering the resting phase of the hair
growth cycle.
Medications given to treat thyroid dysfunction also can cause hair
loss. For example, hair loss is a potential side effect of propylth-
iouracil, the most common medicine used to treat hyperthy-
roidism. Synthroid (levothyroxine), the most common drug used to
replace thyroid hormone, also may cause hair loss. It’s not known
why these medications cause hair loss, but it’s important for
patients to be aware of their potential side effects.
Living with a thyroid condition and hair loss
If you suffer from thyroid disease and experience hair loss, you
should see two important specialists: the endocrinologist, who can
diagnosis and treat your thyroid condition; and the dermatologist,
who can figure out the exact cause of your hair loss and determine
if it’s related to a thyroid disease. Hair loss can accompany many
different conditions, so it’s important to eliminate all other possi-
ble causes before assuming that a condition is thyroid related.
Chapter 5: Diseases that Cause Hair Loss 85

If your doctor determines that your hair loss is caused by thyroid
dysfunction, be patient with treatment. Proper medical treatment
and allowing time for your body to adjust to the new medication
increase the likelihood that your hair will regrow. But you may
have to wait out an entire hair cycle for this to occur, so it may
take up to three years for your hair to return to normal.
Thyroid disease treatments
Patients with hypothyroid conditions (too little thyroid hormone
in your body) are usually prescribed a drug called synthroid, which
is essentially a replacement of the thyroid hormone.
Hypothyroidism can be treated with any of the following:
 Medical therapy in combination with antithyroid drugs. When
a person has too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroid) they
are often prescribed medicine that damages the thyroid gland
so that it produces less thyroid hormone. At times, this treat-
ment is overdone, so a person who was hyperthyroid
becomes hypothyroid so that they need more thyroid hor-
mone to bring the thyroid hormone to normal levels. 
 The destruction of the thyroid gland in combination with
radioactive iodine.
 Surgery to remove the thyroid.
If these treatments don’t work, your doctor should consider treat-
ments for simultaneously occurring androgenetic alopecia, or ANA
(male pattern baldness that has a genetic cause; see Chapter 4 for
more information). Thyroid disease may bring out the genetic
defects of inherited balding so medicines used to treat ANA
include topical minoxidil, spironolactone, and oral Finesteride
(males only). Often there’s no single reason for hair loss, and these
medicines may help decrease hair loss when used with thyroid
replacement therapy.
After you’re diagnosed with thyroid disease and begin treatment,
you may find that your hair loss begins to improve. However, if you
continue to lose hair several months after your thyroid hormone
levels have returned to normal, see your doctor to be sure another
medical condition isn’t causing your hair loss.
Other diseases that can 
cause hair loss
Almost any serious illness can cause temporary hair loss. Some of
the most common are:
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
86

 Anemia: The most common type of anemia is due to iron defi-
ciency. Decreased iron intake (seen in strictly vegetarian
diets) or increased blood loss (sometimes associated with
prolonged periods of heavy menstruation) may cause a drop
in your iron level.
 Diabetes: Endocrine imbalances, stress, and poor circulation
all can lead to hair loss in diabetic patients.
 Malnutrition, including anorexia and bulimia: These disor-
ders produce hair loss particularly if there’s a deficiency in
zinc or essential fatty acids.
 Psoriasis: Treatments used for psoriasis or over-vigorous
removal of plaques from the scalp can cause scalp inflamma-
tion, which may lead to hair loss. When this occurs, it is
almost always from a person ‘picking’ at their hair plaques
pulling out hair to produce traction alopecia.
All forms of chronic illness cause a metabolic shift of nutrients to
the hair follicles and may bring on telogen effluvium (acute or
chronic; refer to the earlier section “Hair today, gone tomorrow:
Telogen effluvium” for an explanation). Telogen effluvium may last
until the primary disease is resolved.
Accidents cause stress and can precipitate hair loss. In men with
known genetic hair loss, stressful events can accelerate the
process, which may not be reversible even after recovery. In
women, hair loss can occur in a similar manner to acute telogen
effluvium and reverses after full recovery from the accident.
A Potentially Permanent Change:
Scarring Alopecia
Despite the sound of the name, scarring alopecia, also called cica-
tricial alopecia, doesn’t always cause visible scars on top of your
head; the scarring is usually beneath the scalp, where hair follicles
are replaced with scar tissue. If severe, it can cause the surface of
the scalp to appear smooth and shiny.
All scarring alopecias have similar microscopic features and show
the body’s immune cells attacking the skin and hair follicles. The
changes in what we see can be quite similar with the changes of
the non-scarring alopecias. Doctors categorize these conditions
based upon the following:
Chapter 5: Diseases that Cause Hair Loss 87

 Characteristics of the skin: The skin loses its shine and tex-
ture and becomes dull and hard to the touch. The skin may
erupt. 
 How hair reacts to the disease: Most of these conditions exist
in particular areas of the scalp and surrounding skin can be
completely normal.
 The presence of what may appear to be an infective component
to the presentation: It is not unusual for the skin to develop blis-
ter type changes with redness that appears infective.
 How the disease starts and evolves over time: The various
scarring alopecias have distinct evolutionary changes in the
skin over time and there may be other elements of the disease
impacting other parts of the body. This is where the skill of
the dermatologist plays an important role. 
 Family history of similar diseases: Family history of the dis-
ease is common in alopecia areata.
 The presence of weeping at the skin level may produce wet-
ness: Some of these diseases can also be dry and crusty, some
have a normal skin, while others have a very fine thin skin
over the involved areas.
Scarring alopecia occurs when the hair follicles are destroyed. If
the condition attacks the hair follicles directly, it’s called primary
cicatricial alopecia; one example is lichen planopilaris (see the fol-
lowing bullets). Indirect follicle damage is called secondary scarring
alopecia; examples include damage from radiation therapy or a
burn injury to the scalp.
Relatively uncommon conditions that can cause permanent, scar-
ring hair loss include:
 Lichen planopilaris: It often appears in the form of purplish
bumps or red-to-purple rims around the hair follicles and can
be on the scalp alone or associated with the skin condition
lichen planus. Although the cause is unknown, it appears that
the body’s white blood cells attack the hair follicles and cause
permanent damage to them.
 Frontal fibrosing alopecia: More common in postmenopausal
women, this condition is characterized by large spaces that
appear between hair follicles of normal diameter. A scalp
biopsy will reveal many immune cells in the process of
destroying the hair follicles they surround.
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
88

 Pseudopelade: This form of scarring alopecia looks like alope-
cia areata in its general shape. It’s not a specific disease but
rather a pattern of old or burned-out scarring alopecia, result-
ing from a variety of causes.
 Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp: This condition is character-
ized by multiple pustules and large cystic nodules in the scalp
and can be associated with severe facial acne. It most com-
monly occurs at the back of the scalp. It’s much more
common in people of African descent.
A scalp biopsy can readily determine if hair loss is non-scarring or
scarring and therefore permanent. However, determining exactly
which scarring condition caused the hair loss can be difficult.
It’s worth repeating that if you’re experiencing hair loss, it’s impor-
tant to see your doctor to determine the type of loss and whether
it’s treatable. And if it is treatable, you should start your treatment
as soon as possible in an effort to prevent permanent hair loss.
Lupus: A Scarring and 
Non-scarring Disease
Lupus is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of organ
tissue (see the sidebar, “What’s an autoimmune disease?,” earlier
in this chapter). Up to half of people with lupus experience hair
loss at some point during the course of the disease; hair loss can
occur in areas near the temples or be patchy and diffuse. The two
main types of lupus are
 SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), which is systemic
(meaning it impacts many parts of the body) and may cause
non-scarring hair loss. Although it’s an autoimmune disease,
SLE spares the hair follicles, so hair grows back after the dis-
ease is successfully treated.
 DLE (discoid lupus erythematosus), which is localized and
may cause scarring hair loss. DLE causes irregular patches of
hyperpigmented (skin that is dark) and hypopigmented (skin
that appears almost white) skin, along with redness, scales,
scarring, and hair follicles devoid of hair. The condition can
occur anywhere on the body but is most common on the head
and neck, particularly the scalp and ears.
General symptoms of lupus include reddish facial rashes, sensitiv-
ity to the sun, mouth ulcers, arthritis, which can be quite disabling,
low-grade fevers, and persistent fatigue. Lupus most commonly
affects women in the 20–50 age bracket. Blood tests diagnose the
condition.
Chapter 5: Diseases that Cause Hair Loss 89

Systemic lupus is a serious disease, and most people who have it
are concerned less with hair loss and more with the graver symp-
toms (such as severe arthritis, diseases of the kidneys and lungs).
There’s no specific treatment for hair loss associated with SLE, but
medications used to treat the disease may also help with hair loss.
To complicate matters, some medications (such as Plaquenil) used
to treat lupus can have the side effect of hair loss. If you recently
started on a new medication to treat lupus and have noticed new
onset hair loss, be sure to consult your doctor to see if the drug is
causing your hair loss.
DLE is a much less serious condition than SLE. Oral medications
such as Plaquenil and the local injection of steroids in the plaques
of the scalp can control the disease, and if your doctor catches it
early, localized hair loss caused by the plaques of DLE may be 
prevented.
May Cause Side Effects:
Medications and Hair Loss
Some medications can do more than cure what ails you: They can
cause you to lose hair. The list of drugs that may cause hair loss is
huge, but here are a few of the more common ones:
 Acne medications, such as isotretinoin (Accutane)
 Antiinflammatory drugs, such as naproxen (Naprox),
indomethacine (Indocin), and naproxen (Naprosyn)
 Antidepressives, such as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine
hydrochloride (Prozac), and sertraline hydrochloride (Zoloft)
 Beta blockers, such as nadolol (Corgard), propanolol
(Inderal), metoprolol (Lopressor), and atenolol (Tenormin)
 Birth control pills
 Blood thinners, such as warfarin sodium (Coumadin) and
heparin
 Cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as gemfibrozil (Lopid)
 Gout medications, such as allopurinol (Lopurin or Zyloprim)
 Seizure medications, such as trimethadione (Tridone)
 Ulcer medications, such as famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine
(Tagamet), and ranitidine (Zantac)

Other Causes of Hair Loss
Sometimes the disease process that results in hair loss actually
has nothing to do with hair. For example, constant or deliberate
hair pulling can result in loss of perfectly normal hair, and constant
traction on hair from rubber bands or other hair accessories can
cause perfectly normal hair to break off. This section looks at a
two unique causes of hair loss.
Tearing your hair out: Obsessive
compulsive disorders
The expression “I’m pulling my hair out” means the speaker is frus-
trated or perturbed. Everyone gets the urge to pull out their hair
now and then, but for some people, literal hair pulling amounts to
an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
An obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder in
which a person tries to defuse his or her obsessive thoughts by
repeatedly performing compulsive tasks. If you repeatedly tug at
your hair, you have a type of OCD called trichotillomania (it’s also
known as “trich” or TTM). TTM is non-scarring, so your hair can
grow back if you stop pulling and tugging. Usually people with tri-
chotillomania pull scalp hair, but they may also yank hair from
their eyebrows, eyelashes, and bodies.
The demographics of TTM
Trichotillomania sufferers fall into two groups:
 Those who intentionally pull out their hair because of an itch
or feeling of pain. Sometimes they get a sense of pleasure from
hair pulling.
 Those who pull out their hair by habit and may not realize
they’re doing it.
TTM is more common in children than adults, often striking in
early adolescence. More women than men suffer from the disorder.
Often the dermatologist is the first to diagnose the problem and
then sends the patient to a psychiatrist for treatment. Quite often,
patients seek help for their hair loss without realizing that it’s self-
induced and that they have trichotillomania.
Chapter 5: Diseases that Cause Hair Loss 91

Treating TTM
Several treatment options are available for trichotillomania. If the
sufferer is a child, cutting the hair short so that it can’t be pulled
may change the child’s behavior over time. 
For older children and adults, self-monitoring can also be a cure.
You record the time and situation of hair pulling and the number of
hairs pulled in an effort to increase awareness of the behavior. You
also may seek behavioral modification or psychotherapy with a
mental health professional. Medication is another option; the most
common drugs used are antidepressants in the serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors class. In addition, Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepres-
sant, may alleviate symptoms.
Prolonged hair pulling: 
Traction alopecia
If you have traction alopecia, you lose hair gradually due to pro-
longed tension on the follicles. People who wear their hair in tight
braids, ponytails, and pigtails are most prone to this problem. It
also can result from using tight roller curlers or repeatedly pulling
the hair when straightening it. Because of these activities, traction
alopecia is more prevalent in women than men and much more
commonly seen in people of African descent. If caught early, it’s
reversible, but persistent traction alopecia can lead to scarring.
The problem first appears as patchy areas of hair loss on 
the periphery of the scalp; eventually these areas can extend 
further into the scalp and result in large areas of hair loss. The
treatment — not putting any more tension on the hair — seems
simple, but getting patients to change old habits is never as easy
as it seems.
It’s essential to detect the condition early so it can be treated
before large amounts of hair are permanently damaged. Late 
diagnosis often means irreversible loss, and no treatment can
make the lost hair grow back again. The only way to restore the
hair is through hair transplantation, which is only practical if not
too much of the patient’s hair has been lost. (Turn to Chapter 13
for more on hair transplantation.)
Part II: The Root of Hair Loss: How and Why It Happens 
92

Enduring Hair Loss with
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the treatment of disease with powerful drugs
meant to kill rapidly growing cancerous cells. Because the drugs
are so potent, chemotherapy has many side effects, one of which is
hair loss. Chemotherapy targets not just cancer cells but all rap-
idly growing cells, including hair follicle cells, which is why
chemotherapy often causes severe hair loss.
Not all chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss; your doctor will tell
you if the drug or drugs you’re taking have this side effect. Some
newer chemotherapy drugs are made to specifically target certain
cells and spare your hair.
Still, if you’re receiving chemotherapy, it’s likely that all your hair
in the actively growing phase will fall out. Because 90 percent of
hair is in this phase of the hair growth cycle at any given time,
essentially all your hair may fall out during treatment. Different
drugs cause different hair loss patterns; with paclitaxel (Taxol), the
loss is sudden, while cyclophosphamide (Cytoxin) causes hair to
thin but not fall out altogether.
The good news is that your hair usually starts to grow back within
six to eight weeks after you stop treatment. You may ask your
doctor about topical minoxidil, which has been shown to acceler-
ate the regrowth of hair by almost two months. When your hair
does grow back, it may initially be curlier and have a different tex-
ture, but it should return to its old self within a year.

eady for some sleight of hand? From covering bald-

more) to taking a little bit of hair and make it appear to be

T
he practice of using toupees and wigs to cover hair loss goes
back to the beginning of recorded history, and the jokes about
toupees blowing away and wigs going askew have been around
almost as long. A toupee is a small piece of hair (real or synthetic)
on a mesh or fabric foundation that’s worn to cover a bald or thin-
ning area of scalp. Wigs cover more area than toupees and are
known by many interchangeable names — hairpieces, rugs, units,
hair systems, systems, or just pieces. For simplicity, we refer to
both wigs and toupees as hair replacement systems, both in this
chapter and throughout the book.
People turn to hair replacement systems for many reasons. For
some, hair restoration surgery isn’t an option due to cost or other
factors; other people need a wig just for a short time because of
hair loss from chemotherapy or another health-related temporary
hair loss situation (see Chapter 5 for disorders that cause tempo-
rary hair loss).
In this chapter, we introduce you to the different types of hair
replacement systems, addressing both their pros and cons as well
as the care and maintenance they require. We also talk about meth-
ods for attaching these systems and the best ways to keep your
hair in place while you live an active lifestyle.

A Brief History of “Rugs”
The earliest known example of a hair system was found in a 
tomb near Hierakonpolis, an ancient city in Egypt. The tomb and
its contents date to 3200–3100 BC. As necessity is the mother of
invention, and to address the balding problem, the hair system
more resembling what’s available today was later invented in the
form of toupees or wigs.
Powerful men throughout history were self conscious about bald-
ing. It’s known that Julius Caesar, who felt that his bald head had to
be addressed, was known to have tried wearing a hair system, and
King Louis XIII began wearing wigs to camouflage his balding con-
dition in the 17th century. Due to King Louis XIII’s tremendous
influence, wigs soon became the fashion throughout France.
In England, King Charles II was restored to the throne after his 
exile in Versailles, where he was exposed to the French wig craze.
The English, not to be outdone by the French, followed the fashion.
The use of hair systems grew in the United States in the 19th 
century as well.
By the 1950s, it’s estimated that over 350,000 American men wore
hair systems, out of a potential 15 million wearers. With only about
one percent of the market captured, the opportunities for hair sys-
tems seemed limitless. Hair system manufacturers helped to build
credibility for their products starting in 1954, when several wig
makers advertised hair systems in major magazines and newspa-
pers. This opened the wig market to the men who knew they had a
problem but didn’t know what to do about it.
With advertising came acceptance of hair systems, and improve-
ments in craftsmanship, pioneered by Max Factor, advanced the
wig-making art of the time. Since that time, some national organiza-
tions like Hair Club for Men, sprung up to offer hair systems to a
wide variety of men through heavy television promotion. For those
of you old enough to remember the famous line Sy Sperling uttered
in his commercials: “I’m not only the Hair Club president, I’m also a
client.” This was one of the more successful ads that helped make
this industry, and it quickly became a phenomenon. 
The heavy promotion on television gave rise to a new industry
where hair salons all over the world started to exploit the market
for hair systems. Almost every city had some specialty shop sell-
ing hair systems, and as a result of the heavy promotion, the qual-
ity of the hair systems got better and better.

Today’s Hair Replacement Systems
Today’s hair systems are quite an improvement over the powdered
wigs of the 1700s. Many are made from human hair, resulting in a
more natural feel and appearance. This section weighs the advan-
tages and disadvantages of hairpieces, explains the attachment
systems available, and prepares you for the care and upkeep of
your hair replacement system.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of hair systems
Hair systems were the only option for balding prior to the late
1950s, when doctors developed hair transplantation. Today, for
men whose baldness is very extensive and who don’t have enough
hair for a hair transplant, a hair system may be the only alternative
to simply shaving the scalp. The cost and the final appearance of a
hair system varies with the materials used and the expertise of the
maker. Cost for a system also varies based on the total costs for
marketing and commission sales. Most clients have two hair sys-
tems so that they can wear one while the other is in the shop.
The major advantages of wearing a hair system are that
 The initial cost can be relatively low.
 You get a fast and easy result (within a few hours) without a
surgical procedure.
Some major disadvantages to hair systems include:
 A rapid change in appearance when the hair system is 
first used
 Lack of durability
 Need for frequent cleaning and repairs
 Need for duplicates for when one is “under repair”
 Potentially unnatural frontal hairline
 Unpleasant smell from scalp sebum (natural oil) buildup
 Accelerated hair loss caused by the hair system
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 99

All hair systems are fragile and must be returned to the maker reg-
ularly for cleaning and upkeep; even with this attention, they usu-
ally last only a year or two. Sun, salt water, human sweat, chlorine
in swimming pools, and harsh shampoos all shorten the life of a
hair system.
The highest quality and most natural-looking hair systems are
custom-made and may cost thousands of dollars. They’re made of
high-quality human hair carefully matched to the original hair of
the client. The hairs, singly or in a few bundles, are skillfully tied
around the threads of the foundation netting and knotted so that
they may follow the pattern of natural hair growth or lie in a direc-
tion that maximizes layering. Hair layered from side to side tends
to cover better and, like a thatched roof, blocks light from pene-
trating the wig (which is important because one doesn’t want the
hair system to be seen through). Good cover is important for the
users and a secure fit is critical because the new wearer will be
most concerned about the feel of the hair system on their head
and their concern that the hair system might just fall off. 
Considering manufacture, upkeep, and replacement, even the aver-
age hair system isn’t cheap, and you must expect continued
expense throughout your life as long as you wear a system. 
The hairs of less expensive hair systems may be made of artificial
fibers or animal hair; cheap hair systems made from artificial fibers
are less durable and begin to look fuzzy very quickly, so you must
replace them at frequent intervals. Human hair has the most natu-
ral appearance and behavior, and the most common and affordable
hair systems are traditionally made from Asian hair that’s dyed or
bleached to approximate Caucasian coloring. Asian hairs are used
because they’re generally coarse, straight, and strong, making
them easier to work with. The costs of hair supplies from salons in
developing Asian countries was far lower than from traditional
European sources. However, the texture may be so different from a
person’s natural hair that the final result doesn’t look convincing.
Also, although Asian hair is very strong, the bleaching and toning
processes make it brittle and dry, making it vulnerable to breakage.
Keeping your hair from falling apart
Hair systems start with a section of netting called the foundation.
The netting is cut and molded to approximate the size and shape
of the bald scalp area in a custom-made hair system; it also can be
more extensive in design, covering not only the bald area but also
covering the existing hair around it to make the transition from
hair system to normal hair more transparent.

Human hair is fragile and the oils, wax, and sebum that is meant to
protect your living hair, becomes a liability for the hair system.
The hair in a hairpiece can’t replace itself as growing hair does and
oils, wax, and sebum can’t flow to the hair shaft because the foun-
dation stands between your scalp and the artificial hair. With a
lessened ability to clean the scalp from sebum and oil buildup, the
hair systems accumulate this buildup. This means that you need to
wash the hair system to get rid of the oil and sebum buildup or
replace the hair system at intervals that depend upon the quality
of the system and your requirements for keeping your hair looking
perfect — or just good enough becomes a problem.
Synthetic hair fibers aren’t as susceptible to injury unless you
wash the hair system too frequently, heat them (or perm them) to
a temperature that melts or chemically alters the fibers, or use
products on the system that aren’t easily removed.
Some people choose to style their hair system with perming equip-
ment, rollers, hot irons, and hair dryers. This styling opens up the
hair system to damage just as the same processes do on a normal
head of hair (see Chapter 3 for more information on these
processes in normal hair). 
Setting up a cleaning schedule
Some types of hair systems are designed to be removed at night to
allow you to wash your scalp and then reapply the hair system in
the morning. When your scalp is cleared of the day’s buildup of
sebum and oils, the hair system will stay cleaner longer. Simple
washing of the hair system doesn’t remove skin cells, skin oils,
shed hair, and other debris that accumulates in the foundation and
in the hair fibers of your hair system. Either you learn to clean
your own hair system on a regular basis or you bring it in for serv-
ice and cleaning to keep it clean and odor free. A spare is an
absolute necessity, possibly two. For those people who use hair
systems that are made to stay on the head for weeks at a time,
there is no real viable option for keeping down the odor and
removing the oils and sebum that builds up every day.
Cleaning/washing the hair system while it is still on your head is
not a viable option for most people for two important reasons
including:
1. The sebum and oils will stay below the foundation even if it is
washed. Only the hair is really subject to washing.
2. The hair system that stays on your head after washing will
remain wet for some time. Wearing a wet hair system is like
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 101

wearing your wet towel without giving it the opportunity to dry.
We all know the musty odor of a wet cloth that is confined to a
closed space. 
Cleaning your hair system with it off your head will allow you to
get to the foundation and remove the oils and sebum, but if you
scrub it too vigorously, you can destroy the hair system relatively
easily. There is clearly some balance between washing and pre-
serving the integrity of the hair system. Drying it with a lukewarm
hair dryer setting deals with that musty smell discussed earlier. 
The attachment mechanism for the hair system is critical. It is
always best to be able to get the hair system off so attachments
with tape may work well for this purpose (see attachment mecha-
nisms later in this chapter). 
For most wearers, the initial expense of owning more than one hair
system is justified by the increased lifespan of the hair systems
because they can be switched while being washed.
Creating a natural-looking 
frontal hairline
It’s not enough to just plop a toupee or wig — even a good one —
on your head and forget about it. One of the problems with hair
replacement systems is the appearance of the frontal hairline.
Unless you have natural hair remaining in your frontal hairline, the
foundation of the hair system may be highly visible, separating it
visually from the scalp and leaving an artificial-looking hairline.
Making this space appear normal is maybe the most challenging
part of the manufacturer’s job. Most hair systems utilize a style
where the hair is actually combed forward over the hairline to hide
it from direct observation. When there is bright light, the leading
edge of almost all hair systems can be seen, so a forward combing
styling may be critical to the disguise. 
The best frontal meshes that extend from the hair system are cus-
tomized to match your skin color and may be see through. The
hair fibers at the hairline should be thinner than the hair used in
the rest of the hair system. This is particularly important when the
system uses coarse hair. As an alternative, the front hairs of the
system can be cut short so that they fall forward, camouflaging the
seam at the front edge of the hair system. Multiple hair thicknesses
on the front of a hair system tend to increase the costs. 
The time investment to manage the fine mesh is considerable and
may be difficult for you to do yourself if you have anything but a
completely bald front. If you still have natural hair growing at your
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
102

hairline, shaving it for such attachments is ideal because any natu-
ral hair present (it grows at a rate of about 1⁄2 inch per month)
causes significant problems in the ability to maintain the attach-
ment beyond a week or so, but shaving the head and using tapes
or glues will eventually cause traction alopecia and a loss of what-
ever hair you had there before you started wearing the hair
system.
Many high-end hair system suppliers offer weekly services to reat-
tach these hair systems and recreate the delicate frontal transition
zone. The flipside is that this care makes the process more time-
consuming than a monthly hair cut would be.
Attaching Your Hair
The greatest worry for anyone who wears a hair system is that it
will unexpectedly come off in public. This fear can dictate your
daily activities and keep you from doing things you like to do —
you may avoid going outside on a windy or rainy day or pass on a
day of water-skiing. But rest assured that manufacturers have put a
great deal of effort into devising methods to attach hair systems
securely. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, which is
why this section helps you assess your options for keeping your
hair where it belongs.
In general, the following methods are used for attaching a hair
system. 
 Glue: The area that the hair system covers is shaved or the
hair is clipped very short, and you use glue around the outer
edge of the hair system to hold it in place.
 Clips: You apply the clips attached to your hair system to the
surrounding fringe of normal hair.
 Double-sided tape: The tape is attached to your hair system,
and you stick it to your shaved scalp.
 Weaves: The weave is a different beast. It sews hair that you
have into the foundation mesh. The hair anchors the hair
system to your scalp, but the hair continues to grow so the
hair system become looser over time (1⁄2 inch of growth per
month can be expected). Most weaves need to be tightened
every 7–10 days. Traction alopecia results from chronic use of
weaves. 
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 103

Gluing it in place
A properly glued hair system is secure and comfortable for the
wearer (some say it’s the most comfortable attachment method
available). You must redo the glue every 10 to 14 days because
your scalp skin sheds under the hair system and eventually the
system will loosen and come off. The opportunity to wash the hair
system when it is re-glued is available to each user. Some people
take enough command of their hair systems to wash them while
others just use their spare while the hair system is being serviced
and washed. During servicing, repairs on the hair system can also
be made and these include: replacing hair that has come out, reat-
taching the hair to the foundation, and styling or color alterations
to account for the exposure to the environment of the wearer. 
Glued hair systems don’t breathe easily (meaning they don’t allow
much air to circulate). Combine that with the fact that you remove
it less often than other hair systems to clean both your head and
the system, and you can understand why you should wash your
hair system frequently enough to minimize any odor from the
body’s sweat and bacterial buildup underneath.
Every person who uses glue as an attachment mechanism devel-
ops a comfortable routine for removal and reattachment. Wearers
often turn to those who sell and service the hair systems to handle
this process.
Getting a professional to remove, reattach, and wash your glued
hair system must be calculated into the total cost of the system.

Loose glue changes a life
Joey loved baseball and played every weekend. At age 22, he got a hair system
attached professionally with glue. When he was 26 years old and playing baseball
every weekend, an accident on the field changed Joey’s life. After hitting a double,
Joey saw the pitcher hesitate and, seeing his opening, Joey ran for third base. He
slid to the base but left his hair system some 10 feet behind him. It came off with his
hat, exposing the front of his shaven bald head where the glue had been.
The crowd was in hysterics, and in the dugout, Joey’s teammates were not kind
about his hair loss. That was the last time Joey ever played baseball. He also lost
contact with all his teammates who had such a good time at his expense. Loose
glue changed the course of Joey’s life.

Glues and clips are used frequently to attach weaves and wefts,
two types of hair systems that we cover later in this chapter. When
these systems are removed, normal hair may be pulled out
because the bonding is often very secure and almost permanent.
Great care should be taken not to put too much glue on the point
of bonding the weave or weft to your natural hair. Some of the
bonding mechanisms that glue the wefts to your scalp can last for
as long as a few months, although this would be unusual.
Snapping and clipping
You may choose to attach your hair system with metal snaps or
clips sewn to the foundation netting that fasten directly to your
natural hair.
 Metal snaps are tied or sewn to the foundation and to your
hair, which means they must be relocated as your natural hair
grows out and the attachment loosens. Some of the advan-
tages of clips and snaps are that
• They’re usually very secure once you get used to them.
• The hairpiece is easily removed so you can cleanse your
scalp and wash your hair as frequently as desired.
 Metal clips are ideal for affixing a hair system during the tran-
sition phase following a hair transplant when a client wants to
cover his baldness while the new hair grows in.
One concern of clips is that the point of attachment to the
existing hair may create localized balding from traction
(called traction alopecia and explained in Chapter 5).
Frequently relocating the clips to different areas of the hair
system may postpone the appearance of traction alopecia,
but sooner or later a bald area will develop at the point of
attachment on the scalp.
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 105
Drilling it in: Don’t try this at home!
One “clever” surgeon invented a snap system for attaching hair systems in which
the snaps are anchored to the skull with drill-holes made in the bone. Bone cement
was used to seal the snap, with the edge of one snap brought through the skin. The
surgeon found some neurosurgical friend to affix the clips to his skull. He was pro-
moting this technique, using his own head as an example. Could he have had a
screw loose himself? We’ll let you decide that for yourself.

Sticking it on with tape
Tape with adhesive on both sides is one of the simplest methods of
attaching a hair system. It’s particularly handy for removing the
hair system at night to wash your scalp thoroughly. This attach-
ment method generally requires that the scalp is shaved under the
taped section.
In spite of its good points, double-sided tape does have some dis-
advantages, including the following:
 Tape can leave a sticky residue of adhesive on the skin and on
the net foundation of your hair system.
 The tape often takes dead skin cells with it when you remove
the hair system from your scalp. These skin flakes eventually
build up on the tape, and as the skin flakes decay, they
develop a pungent odor.
 With the skin buildup on the tape, the tape becomes less
effective and must be changed and replaced. 
 Tape tends to become unstuck when the hair system is pulled
or when you sweat. For this reason, this type of attachment is
especially unsuitable if you like to exercise or spend time in
hot, humid, sunny climates.
 The stickiness of tape is vulnerable to swimming and diving,
activities that tend to loosen the attachment of taped hairpieces.
Tips for keeping your hair tied down
As we mention earlier in this chapter, when you wear a hair system
of any kind, one of your biggest concerns — and perhaps the root
of your self-consciousness — is keeping it in place. No one wants
to find themselves in the embarrassing situation of dealing with fly-
away hair.
All attachment methods can be vulnerable under certain circum-
stances (which we address in the earlier sections on each
method), but there are things you can do to ensure a tight connec-
tion between your scalp and your hair system. Here are a few
ideas:
 Change the glue or tape frequently. The fresher the glue or
tape, the more secure the bond will be.
 If you use clips, also use glue or tape. Combinations of
attachment mechanisms add to attachment security.
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
106

 Keep an open mind and experiment with the alternative
attachment methods if you’re not happy with the one you
usually use.
Attaching extensions: Weaves 
and wefts
If you have hair to work with, you can enhance it by using hair
extensions in the form of weaves or wefts. Hair extensions come in
various sizes and lengths and are groupings of synthetic or natural
hair that are placed into your hair to add bulk to it.
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 107
Change isn’t always a good thing
Michael wore his hair system to work, taking it off after work and at some social
activities around the house. His hair system stylist, Sylvia, called one day to report
a new advance in the product line — a lace front — that would help make Michael’s
hair system less detectable. That was a sticking point for Michael, so he headed to
the hair system office. Sylvia recommended that Michael get the new lace front,
which was a very fine nylon mesh with softer hair than the front of his existing hair
system, which was made of a harsh, coarse hair and without transparent mesh. He
enthusiastically agreed to give it a try.
Michael’s method of attachment was clips attached to the sides and back of his hair
system, and he had a considerable amount of thin hair at his frontal hairline. When
Sylvia offered to shave the front of his hairline in order to glue on the new lace front,
Michael refused the shave, saying that he didn’t want to take such a drastic step
until he was sure he liked it. So Sylvia glued the lace mesh in place, over Michael’s
normal hair in front.
When Michael got home, he felt uncomfortable as the glue pulled on his forehead
and his frontal hairs, so he decided to go back to his previous attachment, using the
spare hair system he kept at home. Unfortunately, when he tried to take off the glued
lace front, it would not come off. He panicked and immediately called Sylvia, but the
office was closed. He didn’t sleep that night because the hair system tugged on his
frontal hair, and he couldn’t remove it as he did every night with the clipped system.
In the morning, Michael returned to the office and had Sylvia remove the lace front
with acetone and alcohol, but the whole experiment pulled out most of the hair he
had at his frontal hairline. The lesson of this story is that everything has its price,
and your comfort level with whatever you choose, is critical to commanding your
independence. 

 Synthetic hair extensions: Hairs are be attached to each
other by putting heat to one end and fusing the hairs together.
The small groupings of 20 to 50 fibers (hairs) may be attached
to the base of your own hair with heat fusion, adhesive,
clamping, wax, or braids.
The use of synthetics reduces the cost of hair extensions
because fibers of monofilament are less expensive than
human hair.
 Natural hair extensions: Hairs are attached as groups of hair.
They can be affixed to a foundation (a weft) or they can be
affixed to each other. The extensions consisting of grouped
hairs can also be glued to your hair. When these extensions
are glued to your existing hair, your original hair can grow and
the extensions will move further away from the scalp as your
hair grows.
Weaving a system in place
People often refer to a weave as a hair system, but it’s really more
of an attachment method. A weave involves a hair system on a
mesh foundation; strands of your natural hair are woven through
the edges of the foundation to secure the weave. This woven
attachment method holds the hair system to your scalp very
securely and naturally because of its many points of attachment.
Weaves can be used for hair systems as a mechanism of attach-
ment. They can also be used to braid groups of hairs or individual
hairs to the person’s own hair. In theory, a single hair woven or
braided to a single hair may be best, but that may be impractical
considering the shear number of braids needed. 
Hair systems secured with weaves require adjustment as the hair
grows in order to keep the system tight to your scalp. After two
weeks, your natural hair will have grown out about 1⁄4 inch, and the
hair system will move easily as an entire unit when touched.
With braided weaves to groups of hair, your natural hair is put into
horizontal cornrows. Braids placed well behind the frontal edge of
your hair can add bulk without detection. Your own hair can be
weaved with the new hair (synthetic or natural hair), or threads or
human hair or artificial hair may be used to enhance the fullness.
The greater the number of attachment point, the more secure will
be the impact. The greater the numbers of braids, the thicker the
hair will appear.
Weaving braids of hair to your own hair can produce traction hair
loss particularly because this attachment approach is left on for
longer periods of time (a few months in some people). They only
become problems when the attached hair moves too far away from
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
108

the scalp as your natural hair grows out. With braids, it’s also diffi-
cult to lubricate or wash your hair because it’s caught up in the
braid. Hair that is braided is often more brittle.
Weaves almost always pull on existing hair, some of which already
may be weakened by the balding process. But even if the hair isn’t
already weakened, the constant pulling of the weave eventually
produces traction alopecia at the points of attachment (this also
happens with wefts, which we explain in the next section). For this
reason, you should have weave attachment points relocated often
to different areas of the scalp.
With good relocation, wefts can add substantial bulk to your exist-
ing hair without causing any permanent damage to your natural
hair. Wefts can also be moved to different locations frequently.
Unfortunately, many technicians who apply these wefts don’t
understand the importance of moving them, so it is incumbent on
the wearer to direct the process as the wefts are reattached.
You also have the option of weaving artificial hair with the real hair
without a mesh foundation. One company invented special clips to
attach strands of artificial or human hair to the bottom of the shaft
of growing hair (almost one for one). Attaching this hair system is
a tedious process requiring a very hefty fee (in the $50,000 range)
and expensive weekly adjustments to tighten the strands of hair
and move them back toward the scalp as the hair grows out. The
normal hair acts as the anchor that holds the attached hair as your
normal hair grows out. Many similar services have been developed
at different facilities for far less costs, but unfortunately, all these
techniques cause traction alopecia.
Using wefts
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, a weft is a type of hair system.
It’s usually a linear strip of human or synthetic hair that’s bonded
to a latex or fabric strip. Wefts tend to be longer than the systems
used in weaves (braids of hair to hair), and they generally contain
more than 50 hairs or synthetic hair fibers. They may require more
points of attachment. They also provide more hair bulk than
weaves.
Wefts that are made with human hair woven into mesh are more
expensive than those that are pressed together with a machine and
glued to the mesh foundation. Regardless, the wefts should match
your hair color and hair thickness. After they’re applied, they’re
cut down to the length that fits with your hair style.
The wefts can be woven into place using your natural hair, which is
passed through the mesh with appropriate sewing needles and
then knotted. Another attachment method involves the use of
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 109

adhesive glue that holds the weft onto the parted hair or scalp.
This bond creates a barrier for fingers getting down to the scalp
when someone tries to run their fingers through your hair. 
Attaching wefts with adhesive is fast and less expensive than other
attachment methods, although it does usually require a profes-
sional to do it well. Clips allow flexibility for the user who wishes
to apply the weft on their own. 
There’s no telling how long wefts will stay in place. For some
people, their wefts stay attached for many weeks. But for others,
the wefts may loosen up with the first shampoo. Natural hair oils
cause the bond to lose its adhesive properties if it is glued, and an
edge of a weft may lift off of the attached hair. If you use glue
attachments, in order to help your wefts stay in place as long as
possible, we recommend that you comb the hair very carefully and
avoid perming your hair unless you use a salon that has experi-
ence combining hair styling with the advantages of the weft.
Attachment no-nos
Three attachment techniques require special attention because of
the risks and serious consequences involved: sew-ons, tunnels,
and the implantation of artificial fibers. We mention these tech-
niques only to warn you against them. The damage of a scarred
scalp is very difficult to hide or cover, and all three of these tech-
niques will permanently scar your scalp. In our practices, we see
patients seriously deformed by these techniques and always
advise against them.
Sewing it on
With sew-ons, the hair system is stitched directly onto your scalp
with an encircling, permanent surgical suture. This procedure is
illegal in the U.S. and most European countries. Unfortunately, in
New Jersey, a few companies have been able to use this dangerous
technique for years despite attempts by the New Jersey attorney
general to block them. They sidestep the law by employing retired
doctors with a valid medical license to sew them into the scalp.
The hair systems are attached to the stitch that is placed through
the skin of the scalp. If this turns you off, we include it to dissuade
anyone from considering this barbaric technique.
Skin is a more complex organ than most people realize. One of the
skin’s essential functions is to prevent bacteria and viruses in the
environment from entering the bloodstream and reaching the vital
organs. A suture through the skin leaves a small hole that allows
bacteria to migrate into the fatty tissue under the skin. Long-term
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
110

sutures through the skin often result in infection and abscesses
(tender masses full of pus and bacteria).
Many sutures incite enough of a reaction to cause the suture to be
rejected and extruded by the skin, tearing a large hole in the scalp.
(Most sutures in the scalp are rejected by the person’s body.)
Surgical sutures left in the skin for too long need to be replaced,
which is part of the profit of the sew-on business. This process of
expelling the sutures is hastened when any traction is applied.
Between the sutures, the scars that they cause, and the recurrent
infections, a wall of scar tissue gradually builds up in a circle
around the sutured wounds. This encircling scar may eventually
cause blood supply problems to the central portion of the scalp,
and a thin, parchment-like layer of scar tissue may replace the skin
in the center of the scalp. Any permanent hair that was present in
the area surrounded by the suture is killed off. The damage from
this process is permanent and the pain from the complications of
this approach can be unbearable. 
Tunneling grafts into the scalp
With this technique, tunnels are created in the skin of your scalp.
These tunnels are made from small skin flaps from your own scalp
skin. To make them permanent, skin grafts are often taken from
another area of the body. Usually you get three tunnels: one in the
front and two in the back. Plastic or nylon hooks are sewn to your
hair system, and the hooks are inserted into the tunnels. The
attachment is quite secure, and you can easily remove and replace
the hair system without a visit to a wigmaker’s salon. The best part
of these tunnel grafts is that once they are in and secure, they are
completely painless. 
The obvious disadvantage of this procedure is that it involves
minor surgery, and you must ask yourself if the punishment fits the
crime. The tunnel grafts create a deformity that looks like handles
to a suitcase. If the tunnels are removed later, permanent scars
remain in the scalp. With enough donor hair, hair transplants may
cover the scars on the back of the head left by the tunnels; how-
ever, the scar in front may be more difficult to conceal. And if you
may need a hair transplant in the future to cover the damage from
tunnels, why not just have a hair transplant in the first place?
Planting artificial fibers
The manufacturer of a synthetic polymer claims that its products
look and feel like human hair. The material comes in small bundles
of fibers that are implanted directly into the scalp. It’s most widely
used in Japan and elsewhere in Asia but not in the U.S. or many
European countries. 
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 111

Be careful about considering this option, as its safety is in ques-
tion. The artificial fibers can cause many problems, not the least of
which is scalp infection, which can be severe and difficult for the
body to fight off because the fibers are embedded into the skin
(similar to the sew-on sutures; refer to the earlier section, “Sewing
it on”). Thousands of artificial fibers go through the scalp, and an
average of 15 to 25 percent of the fibers are pushed out of the
scalp each year. Initially, the results are quite remarkable and
almost bald men look like they have a crew cut, but the price that
one pays becomes more evident over time as infections occur, and
the fibers are expelled. Scarring remains after all of the artificial
fibers are expelled by the body. 
It’s almost impossible to treat the infections from these artificial
fibers without removing the foreign material. The artificial fibers
are brittle and tend to break off at the skin level, leaving bits of for-
eign debris under the skin that festers, swells, and produces pock-
ets of pus. Infection caused by fiber implants also may cause
premature loss of natural hair follicles adjacent to the artificial
fibers. Over time, inflammation may destroy the scalp to the extent
that further hair transplants of any kind are difficult or impossible.
Aside from potential scalp infection, the artificial fibers have an
unnatural, stiff texture that doesn’t feel like real hair. Combing is
difficult because traction can break the fibers or pull them out, and
using a hair dryer on them causes the fibers to frizz. Damage to the
fibers above the skin level is permanent.
With so many problems and the fact that the process is illegal in
most countries, one wonders why companies that make artificial
fiber implants are still in business. The answer is simply profits.
Anyone in the U.S. who sells these systems should be immediately
turned over to the state medical boards.
Women and Hair Systems
As we explain in Chapters 4 and 5, women suffer from genetic thin-
ning more often than outright baldness. The exception is about 15
percent of women, who experience frontal balding, develop a pat-
tern similar to the Norwood classifications Class IIIA or IVA pattern
of balding seen in men. We discuss this classification system in
Chapter 4. Essentially, this type of balding goes from front to back.
When a woman has this pattern, she may or may not lose the
frontal 1⁄3 inch of hair but the hair extending as far back as about 3
inches may become very bald or very thin. 
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
112

Women frequently treat genetic hair thinning themselves using hair
systems that clip onto existing hair, but other attachment methods
are possible as is discussed earlier in this chapter. The use of
attachments is often a styling decision intended to thicken finer
hair, because the holy grail for women is thick, luxurious hair —
the type heavily promoted in magazine and television ads to the
tune of billions of dollars annually.
As a woman, your options for attaching a hair system to your 
natural hair are
 Clips that attach close to the scalp.
 Weaves (discussed in the section, “Weaving a system in
place,” earlier in this chapter), in which small hair systems
are woven into your hair.
 Wefts (discussed in the section “Using wefts”), in which long
strips of hair are glued into the base of your hair.
African American women in particular are prone to alopecia, the
fancy, medical name for hair loss. The use of thermal or chemical
hair straightening products and hair braiding or weaving are
styling techniques that place African American women at higher
risk for various forms of “traumatic” alopecia than their Caucasian
counterparts. 
For example, tight braids that have pulled back the hair since
childhood cause a substantial amount of traction alopecia in
African American women. And traction alopecia has pushed many
African American women to wear full wigs because the hair on 
the sides (which is often lost from the traction alopecia) isn’t
easily hidden with even a small wig or any other hair replacement
systems.
Adding Up the Costs 
of Hair Systems
The cost of a hair system is highly variable because it depends on
so many factors. This section looks into the practical financial
costs as well as those costs that you may not think of right away —
psychological effects and the possible lasting effect on your 
natural hair.
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 113

Starting with financial costs
Dollars-wise, the cost of a hair system depends on a number of fac-
tors. And there’s no one-time-only cost when it comes to hair
replacement systems, especially because you may want to pur-
chase up to three hair systems: one to wear, one as a spare, and
one to wear if the others need repair.
Here are the basic variables that affect how much of a hit your
bank account takes thanks to your hair systems:
 The quality and durability of the system
 The manufacturer’s marketing costs
 Monthly maintenance costs for cleaning and repairing what
hair has fallen out
 Purchasing new hair systems as the old ones wear out
 Changing your hair system to match your natural hair color as
it changes due to aging (that is, as it turns gray)
In the end, there’s no set cost for a hair system, and as long as you
choose to wear one, you’ll be paying something for it on a frequent
or regular basis.
Assessing your psychological costs
You may wonder what psychological costs could possibly result
from wearing a hair system. For some people, worrying constantly
about their hair — Is it going to stay in place? Can other people 
tell they’re wearing hair systems? Are people secretly laughing
behind their backs? — may outweigh any benefit of having a full
head of hair.
The only one who knows how you react to such things is you. If
you know you’re a worrier and are likely to spend much of your
time reaching up to see if your hair’s still there, or constantly
trying to read strangers’ expressions to catch their reactions to
your system, you may be better off without a hair replacement
system. Other options are available, after all; we cover them in
Parts IV and V of this book.
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
114

Considering the possibility 
of accelerated hair loss
Some hair systems accelerate hair loss. This is generally due to the
attachment method causing traction on the existing hair. Glues and
tapes are notorious for accelerating hair loss. Some doctors also
theorize that the psychological stress of wearing the hair system
(refer to the previous section) can contribute to hair loss. This
theory has been observed in identical twins when one has a hair-
piece and the other doesn’t. 
Dr. Rassman had a pair of identical twins in their late 20s. One had
a hair system and the other did not. The one with the hair system
used clips, but his hair loss had advanced far more than his identi-
cal twin brother who wore no hair system. Dr. Rassman has seen
this in a number of identical twins. 
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 115
Beware the wig salesman who 
wants to clip your hair!
Twenty-one-year-old Charlie was concerned about his frontal corner recession (the
hair in the corners of his hairline meets the side hair of the temple), so he looked
through the phone book and found a full page ad proclaiming a modern form of hair
replacement and a medical breakthrough. Charlie got the courage to visit the com-
pany’s office, where he met a likeable salesman who looked at Charlie’s balding
area and, with hardly a word, clipped the front of Charlie’s frontal hairline back 2
inches from the front! “Don’t worry about a thing,” said the salesman. “If you don’t
like what I’ve got, there’s no charge and you can just walk away.”
Needless to say Charlie was freaked out with the frontal 2 inches of hair clipped
close to the skin; his 3-inch-long hair behind it made for an embarrassing contrast.
The salesman took out a small hair system with tape on the back and stuck it to the
newly clipped area on Charlie’s scalp. Immediately, Charlie had a full head of hair,
but he was left with no choice but to buy the hair system. When he walked out of
the office, although he felt okay about his new ’do, he was uncomfortable at having
been taken in by the sales process.
This was the beginning of Charlie’s 20-year relationship with hair systems. His hair
system changed as his hair style changed, and as his hair grayed so did his hair
system. As his balding progressed over time, his hair system became larger. The
problem that Charlie didn’t notice initially was that his hair systems were slowly
pulling out the rest of his frontal hair. His hair system became an addiction, costing
him thousands of dollars every year. Unfortunately, at no time was Charlie given the
opportunity to explore other hair loss treatment options — he was hooked.

Maintaining Your New Hair
Using a hair replacement system is much more complicated than
simply buying something and sticking it on your head. (That only
works if you’re using your new hair to block the sun and not as a
way to improve your appearance!) You’ve probably seen people
with hair replacement systems that are so obvious — and so badly
in need of TLC — that they turn you off the idea of a hair system.
But you need to remember that a well-maintained and well-fitted
system isn’t noticeable. In order to help you achieve the best,
unnoticeable results, this section covers some dos and don’ts for
keeping your hair looking as good as the rest of you.
Staying active — and keeping 
your hair on!
If you’re very active or participate in sports, one of your main con-
cerns may be how difficult it will be to keep your hair in place
while you’re in the water or running down the soccer field, for
example. Most people with hair systems try not to push them to
the limits, at least not when other people are around!
Most wearers restrict many activities like water-skiing, yet many
hair replacement advertisements show men wearing their prod-
ucts while water-skiing! We’ve heard reports from some people
who have done just what the ads suggest and had their systems
come off in the most embarrassing social situations. Our recom-
mendation is that you use common sense, and if you think your
hair system may not hold up to your activity, consider changing
your plans.
Everyone is different, so what works for one person may not work
for another. Generally, hair systems hold up to gentler sports (such
as running, golf, tennis, most aerobic exercises and gym activities,
and skiing the bunny slopes, for example), but if you’re into more
aggressive athletics, you may be better off taking off your hair
system and wearing a hat instead. For example, direct contact
sports are clearly risky for detachment.
Two other problems plague many hair system users:
 What to do when your system gets wet in the rain
 How to manage sweating underneath the hair system
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
116

Unfortunately, these problems aren’t easily solved. Our best rec-
ommendation is that you carry a spare hair system with you and
make a switch when such problems occur.
Keeping up with regular care 
and maintenance
Many women — and men — have standing appointments at the
hair or nail salon. Think of maintenance for your hair system in the
same way — as just part of your normal routine. Following are
some handy guidelines for the care of your hair system:
 Set up a schedule for having your hair system washed —
whether you do it yourself or take it to a professional. Don’t
wait until it starts to smell.
• If you use a hair system that attaches with either clips or
tapes, smell the system when you remove it at night. You
should wash it frequently enough to keep any odor neu-
tral and to avoid the “What’s that smell?” look from your
closest friends.
• If your hair system is attached with glue, and you’re not
an expert on the application of the glue, you may not be
aware of a developing odor because you don’t remove
the hair system nightly. Therefore, your maintenance
schedule should take into account the timing of develop-
ing odors. Ask someone near and dear to you to give it a
sniff and judge if your hair system needs to be washed. If
you’re too embarrassed to involve another person, just
arrange a standing appointment with your system main-
tenance service people.
 If you have a weave, the weave will loosen as your hair
grows, so you should have it professionally adjusted two or
three times a month. The longer you wait between adjusting
the weave, the looser it will become. And the looser is
becomes, the greater the risk of traction alopecia (refer to
Chapter 5). A wig that moves around your head is not only
uncomfortable, but you also have to worry that others may
detect it because most people’s hair doesn’t shift around!
 If your hair system involves wefts, you should have it serv-
iced before the wefts come loose from the base of the hair
that they’re attached to. It’s relatively easy to feel the point of
attachment, and when the wefts start to come off, you’ll feel
them peeling away. Servicing a weft requires expertise, and
it’s usually done by salons that specialize in this type of hair
system. It’s best to be proactive in servicing your weft and not
Chapter 6: Toupee or not Toupee? 117

wait for it to peel off; there’s almost nothing more obvious
than a weft that hangs apart from your hair and scalp.
 Think of your hair system maintenance like you do car
maintenance: Attend to it regularly, and have the whole
system looked over for potential problems. Your service
experts will tell you when your hair system is wearing out,
and if that’s detected early, the repairs hopefully won’t break
the bank.
 Don’t forget to maintain your spare hair system(s). It’s
always smart to be prepared for the unexpected, and you
never know when you’ll need your backup plan.
As you can see, the timing of your maintenance program depends
largely on the type of hair system you have, but you’ll always bene-
fit from being proactive. For example, servicing your system before
you take a vacation is a good move. With some experience under
your belt, you’ll figure out just how much preventive maintenance
is required. Setting up a schedule is critical.
Recognizing when it’s 
time to replace
Even the most expensive hair system won’t last forever. On aver-
age, you can expect your system to last for a year or two with
proper care. The more expensive hair systems made of human hair
will last longer. As we mention earlier in this chapter, you’ll need to
replace your hair system as your natural hair color changes in
order to keep the transition as seamless as possible. And if you
work in sandy or dusty environments, it will become dirty, picking
up dirt and grime between the hair filaments and in the foundation.
The more dirt and grime on the hair system, the harder it is to
clean (which may mean gentle washing isn’t very effective) and the
more frequently it requires washing.
Consider wearing a hat instead of your hair system when you’re
working in a dusty environment. It makes no difference if you’re an
executive who only occasionally visits construction sites — the
hair system will pick up elements of the environments you visit,
and that can either accelerate damage or be a tip-off to others that
your hair’s not really yours.

Replacement Systems
In This Chapter
 Deciding to buy a hair replacement system
 Finding the right place to buy a system
 Understanding how wigs are made
 Taking care of your new hair
 Choosing a wig for temporary hair loss
W
ith all the options today to seed, replant, or clone hair (just
kidding about that last one — for now), you may wonder
why you should consider a wig. Many people consider wigs, or the
more modern term, hair replacement systems, because they’re
fearful of surgery or can’t afford hair transplant surgery, or
because they only need to cover temporary hair loss as with
chemotherapy.
In this chapter, we talk about how wigs are made and measured,
how to find the right wig for you, and how to care for it. We also
explain how to tell a good wig from a bad one.
Getting Wiggy with It
When deciding to cover up your balding or thinning hair with a
hair replacement system such as a wig, you may be leery because
of the number of jokes made over the years about “bad rugs” and
the cartoons illustrating wigs landing in someone’s soup, or blow-
ing across the parking lot. 
Rest assured: Modern hair systems can be can be completely 
undetectable — and are well anchored, so that gaffes of the past
can be completely avoided. 

Don’t be misled by the term “wig” into thinking that we’re just dis-
cussing cover-ups for women; men’s toupees and hairpieces are
also considered wigs, or hair replacement systems.
Going Shopping: Where to Start?
For the most part, specialty shops such as wig makers aren’t part
of most people’s daily shopping routine. So where do you start
when you’re looking for a hair replacement system — the yellow
pages, the Internet, or by following someone with a good-looking
wig and asking them where they bought it?
The wig market has expanded greatly in the last few years, particu-
larly in Asia, and is now a billion-dollar business. So lots of compa-
nies are competing for your business, and being a careful
consumer can get you the best product at the best price. But
before you start shopping, you’ve got to know how to do your
research first.
Deciding which wig fits 
your needs and budget
Not surprisingly, your biggest consideration before shopping for a
wig should be price for the initial purchase and in finding out the
long-term cost to maintain it. A wig is expensive, and even good
ones need replacing every year or two.
You may also want a “hair and a spare” for times when you want a
different hairstyle, or as a back up if something happens to the one
you have.
The price of the wig depends on its quality and on what it’s made
of. The most common wigs are made of the following materials:
 Human hair: Wigs made of human hair are the highest quality
and the most natural looking (and feeling). They usually start
at around $1,200, and maintenance costs average a compara-
ble amount per year.
 Animal hair: A wig made of goat or horsehair is a popular,
cheaper alternative (in the low hundreds of dollars). Wigs 
are also made from other animals’ hair, such as yak. These
wigs also require maintenance similar to that of natural
human hair.

120 Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
120

 Synthetic materials: This is the cheapest option — such wigs
are available for around $50. Wigs made of synthetic materials
are the easiest to care for because the color and shape last
longer. However, these wigs are also the least natural to the
touch and eye.
 Combination of human hair and synthetic materials: Wigs
often consist of both human hair and synthetic materials. The
downside is that human hair needs to be maintained differ-
ently than the synthetic fibers.
The price of a wig also depends on whether it’s been hand- or
machine-made. For more on hand-made wigs, see the section
“Understanding How a Custom-Fit Wig Is Made” later in this 
chapter.
 Machine-made wigs: This is the cheaper option. Strands of
hair are sewn into a net base singularly or in groupings tied to
a netting. They look very realistic when the hair falls in the
style in which it was sewn, but if the wind blows or you pull
the hair up, the netting below can be very visible and obvious.
These wigs are normally used for costume parties rather than
as hair replacement systems. 
 Hand-made wigs: These wigs are more expensive and more
realistic-looking. Each strand is sewn individually rather than
in strips to make the hair fall and move more naturally — in
fact, you can style hand-made wigs as you do your own hair.
Remember that the real cost of a wig made of human hair can add
up to a few thousand dollars a year when you weigh in the pur-
chase, replacement, and maintenance costs. You may also want to
have your wig washed at the shop, because shop equipment prob-
ably can do a more thorough job of it than you can, and careful
washing and drying can help extend the life of your hair system.
Finding a specialty shop
After you’ve determined how much you plan to spend, you have a
better idea of where to shop. Some specialty shops may simply be
out of your price range, but you never know until you ask. If you
know someone who wears a hair replacement system, that person
may be able to recommend a shop in your area. But if all your
friends are skittish about discussing what’s on top of their heads (a
common problem for the new wig candidate), you may have to
resort to opening the phone book and calling around. Look under
both “Hair Replacement” and “Wigs” for shops near you.
Chapter 7: Shopping for Hair Replacement Systems 121

Most specialty shops have full services, from sales to fitting and
repairs all under one roof. Salespeople who are skilled and knowl-
edgeable about the various products they sell generally work at
the stores, but remember that they’re still, first and foremost,
salespeople who have a product to sell. Ask the following ques-
tions before you sign on the dotted line:
 How long has this shop been in business?
 Is the owner of the shop here? What’s his background in
replacement?
 How long have you (salesperson) worked here?
 Do you have any references I can talk to?
 What are the total costs, including fitting and adjustment
costs?
 How often will I need maintenance on this product? (If the
answer is “none,” you’re in the wrong shop! Every wig needs
regular maintenance.)
 How long does a wig usually last? (If the answer is “forever,”
run! Most wigs last only a year or two.)
 What kind of materials do you use?
 What attachment systems do you use, and which ones do you
recommend?
 Do you have a warranty? (In case hair starts falling off the
minute you leave the shop)
 Are your wigs hand- or machine-made? Who makes them?
As with buying a car, you probably don’t want to buy at the first
shop you visit. Go to several specialty shops to get a better idea of
the differences among shops and among their products. These are
people you’re going to be seeing often for styling and repairs, so if
you don’t feel comfortable in the shop, it’s probably not a good
choice for you.
Don’t be talked into having any part of your head shaved in order
to try a wig on, no matter what the salesperson tells you. Some
sleazy facilities are very skilled in the art of the sale, and may try
to get you to shave the front of your head so that you’re stuck
having to buy the wig just to keep from looking odd when you walk
out the door.

Choosing a style
Choosing a new hairstyle can be a bewildering task. Should you go
radically different from your current color and style and buy some-
thing that looks like you magically woke up one morning with a
new full head of hair? Or should you go for a gradual increase of
hair and buy several wigs, each one a little fuller than the last, so
no one will notice?
In general, you should choose a wig in the same way you choose a
hairstyle: it should be a color that suits your skin tone and a style
that suits your face shape. A stylist or wig salesperson can help
you find the right style.
Buying online: Worth the risk?
Combine the popularity of hair replacement systems with the pop-
ularity of the Internet and what have you got? A lot of online
options for ordering instant hair! But online sales don’t give you
that warm fuzzy feeling that any manufacturing or fitting problems
will be taken care of. That’s why most people seek a personalized
service at a local wig salon when purchasing a hair system.
An Internet search for “hair replacement systems” returns hun-
dreds of thousands of possibilities! The advantage to Internet
shopping is mainly the cheaper cost and the extra privacy. You can
choose a design, fill out and send the special forms for fitting
requirements, and finalize the sale in a matter of minutes. Of
course, experience taking measurements and buying off the
Chapter 7: Shopping for Hair Replacement Systems 123
Haircuts for wig wearers
One perk to wearing a wig is that getting a new style, even for an evening, is just a
matter of getting a new wig. But most wig wearers still have some of their own hair
underneath that still needs cutting and maintaining.
Do you take off your hair system for a hair cut or do you leave it in place? If your
hair system is fixed on with clips, you can easily remove it to get your hair cut, but
if you use glues to hold it in place, the hair cut can become a challenge. Often, the
scalp is shaved under the hair system, but even hair buried under a wig continues
to grow, and will eventually need a trim. If you want you hair cut around your wig,
be sure the person cutting your hair knows how to manage your wig.
Fortunately, many wig shops offer haircuts as part of the services they supply their
clients. Be sure and ask if your shop provides this service.

Internet may be difficult if you’re a novice. And then when it comes
in the mail, what do you do with it? How do you attach it? Does it
feel custom made for your head? Very doubtful!
If you can’t try a wig’s fit before buying, try sizing your head by
trying on a series of baseball caps and matching them up with wig
sizes. Many of the wigs come in a series of standard sizes ranging
from small to extra-large, so you may increase your chances of
ordering a better fit if you have some idea of where you fall in that
spectrum.
However, the old adage about getting what you pay for is definitely
a factor in Internet shopping. Among the caveats of shopping
online are the following:
 You don’t know much about the people you’re buying from.
The Internet businesses come and go, and getting shafted is
unfortunately not all that unusual when dealing with Internet
companies that have to turn high volumes of sales.
 You can’t see what you’re buying in advance; materials used
in wigs vary greatly, and cheap materials look just that: cheap.
 You may not measure your head correctly; an ill-fitting hair-
piece is the biggest giveaway that your hair isn’t your own.
 Corrections and adjustments are difficult; a local shop is
much better at fixing problems as they occur. Internet trans-
actions start to seem less convenient if you can’t get anyone
to answer your e-mails or calls.
 You still need to find someone locally to style, wash, or main-
tain your hairpiece, unless you really want to send your hair
back and forth through the mail.
Make sure you have a way to contact the Internet shop if you have
problems. Do they have an 800 number? A hotline? E-mail that’s
answered frequently?

The dying art of wig making
Things have certainly changed in the wig making business over the past three cen-
turies. The art of wig making, a growing and thriving trade in the 17th through 19th
centuries, is being replaced by low-cost labor and mechanization. For years, wig
making was a craft that took decades to learn and perfect. But like many trades-
men skills of old, the economics of mass production are killing what’s left of the old,
personalized wig making business and the skills that went along with it. 

Choosing a Human Hair Wig
If you decide on a human hair wig, be sure you know how to differ-
entiate between the quality of the hair used and the way in which
the wig was made. The variables that dictate the quality of the wig
include the following:
 Thickness of the hair: Thick hairs are usually less expensive
but cover better; finer hairs, which don’t provide as much
cover for each strand of hair used, are more natural in appear-
ance and softer to the touch. Wigs made of finer human hair
require more hair to provide adequate cover, which, of
course, increases the cost, because the more hair used, the
greater the labor and the time required to build the wig. The
hair needs to be dense enough to prevent light from penetrat-
ing through it, into the netting, and down to the scalp. 
Using three or four fine hairs combined together may increase
the thickness of the hair and reduce the cost of labor, but it
doesn’t feel as delicate as when single strands of hair are used
and appropriately knotted in position. Animal hair (such as
horse or goat hair) is popular among some wig makers to
keep costs down because these hairs are thicker and less hair
is needed to fill out the wig. 
 Method of hair attachment: Each hair is either glued to the
foundation (a process more common in cheaper wigs) or
sewn into the mesh one hair at a time (a technique more
common in quality wigs).
 Type of knotting: The number and style of knots used to
attach the hair contribute to the security of the hair fixation
to the mesh. Single strands of hair with single knots tend to
loosen and come apart; these wigs don’t hold up well over
time. Single strands of fine human hair with multiple knots are
more secure. The type of knots and the stitch techniques that
are used are critically important. 
Sometimes, three or four hairs are tied together at the base,
which reduces the labor cost. More hair tied at the base may
be visible on close inspection. 
If each individual hair is fine human hair placed one by one in high
density and knotted with at least two knots to secure it to the
mesh, the wig becomes a quality product that looks and feels more
natural. 
It may sound odd, but to get some insight into wig making, go to a
carpet store and ask to see the rugs that they sell. Ask the sales-
person to tell you the difference between a fine expensive carpet
Chapter 7: Shopping for Hair Replacement Systems 125

and a cheap one. He or she will almost certainly tell you about the
number of stitches per inch, the quality of the fibers he is using
(wool or silk quality), the type of wool or synthetics used, the
number of knots per strand, and so on.
Choosing a Synthetic Wig
A handmade human hair wig may not be in your budget at the
moment, but if the thought of a synthetic wig makes you cringe,
you may be surprised when you do a little shopping around!
Synthetic wigs are more natural-looking than ever before. The syn-
thetics are most frequently made of a monofilament, somewhat like
a piece of fishing line. These come in many sizes and colors and
can be sewn into the foundation mesh. They don’t hold the knots
well, so more knots must be used. Popular monofilaments include
Kanekalon and Toyokalon.
The advantages of going synthetic include the following:
 It’s yours the day you buy it; you don’t have to wait for your
new hair to be custom made.
 You can see exactly what you’re getting.
 It’s relatively inexpensive.
 You can change your look by buying several different wigs
without breaking the bank.
The disadvantages of a synthetic wig include some of the following
considerations:
 It doesn’t look as natural as human hair.
 You can’t style it.
 You can’t get it fitted specifically to your head.
 It may feel plastic to the touch.
 Depending upon the foundation and any stitching, close
inspection may reveal your secret.
Synthetics don’t accept a perm, and the color can’t be changed to
any significant degree. Synthetic wigs are designed to stay looking
the way they did when you originally bought them; trying to
change or restyle them can cause significant damage to the wig.
The life of a good synthetic wig can be one or two years or more,
depending on their quality, how well you take care of them, and
how often you wash them. Synthetic materials are fairly sturdy and
are likely to last longer than human hair wigs.

Understanding How a Custom-Fit
Wig Is Made
The foundation of a custom-made wig starts with a fabric mesh cut
to the head size of the wearer. The foundation is usually a large
size polyester-cotton-type lace fitted over a wig-block and cut
according to, the penciled outline. The master wig maker then pins
a finer lace to the front and to the back of the foundation while
holding the leading edges with pins (see Figure 7-1). The mesh
foundation is pinned to a block, and the wig maker places individ-
ual hairs into the mesh one at a time. Each hair is knotted so that
the direction of the hair is controlled.
Figure 7-1: The mesh foundation and individual hairs.
Measuring for a wig
The fit of a wig does a lot to enhance its overall appearance and
realistic look. Think of a customized suit of clothes that accounts
for your uniquely sized shoulders and waist. Humans just don’t
come in standardized sizes. When you measure for a wig, the 
measurer holds a cloth measuring tape snug to the scalp, keeping
the tape flat to avoid twists and kinks in the tape. Expect the fol-
lowing areas of measurement:
Chapter 7: Shopping for Hair Replacement Systems 127

 The circumference from your proposed hairline to the back
most prominent part of the skull, keeping it about 1⁄2 inch
above the ears.
 The lowest rear point of the skull in the middle (just before
the place where the bend in the neck can be felt when you tilt
your head back) to the top of your forehead.
 From ear to ear with the tape going over the top of the head.
 From ear to ear with the tape going across the forehead.
 From the temple prominence to the very back of the head.
The temple prominence should be at a line equal to the upper
arch of your eyebrows and is generally located approximately
11⁄2 inches from the side border of the eyebrow.
The wig maker then cuts the mesh foundations to these 
measurements.
Remember that the head is oval or round, and the mesh foundation
is flat. Like a map of the world, the curves must be created from
the flat mesh.
Less expensive wigs have a stretchable foundation, with the size
chosen so that one wig size may fit many head sizes. More expen-
sive wigs are customized, so you can choose the color, hair length,
hair texture and style. Some wigs have Velcro strips inside them
that the wearer can tighten for a better fit, much like the belt on
your pants.
Most wig sales facilities have a variety of stock sizes (small,
medium small, medium, medium large, and large), from which your
wig can be fit to your head (like fitting a suit from a fine haber-
dasher). This fitting process is a clear advantage over an Internet
purchase, where you can’t feel and see the product as it may
appear on your head.
Sound complicated? At least it helps explain why custom wigs are
better, yet so much more expensive, than wigs off the rack. 
Tools of the trade
As with every trade, wig making requires a particular set of tools.
The basic tools are as follows:
 A punch needle: This is the needle used to attach the hair to the
wig’s base. The traditional punch was just a sawed off sewing
needle, but it was hard to push through a latex or silicone pad. A
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
128 Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
128

properly designed punch needle has a hook near the tip of the
needle, making it possible to just push the needle through a
latex edge, grab a hair or a group of hairs and pull it back
through the mask.
 Nylon or polyester lace: A very fine, skin-colored lace made
of nylon or polyester is used at the periphery of a quality wig
that is attached to the central foundation. Figure 7-2 shows a
very expensive wig with a lace front.
A full range of colors for the mesh is necessary because of the
wide variety of skin colors found in the population. The mesh
takes on the person’s regular skin color so that the hair looks
natural when parted, as in Figure 7-3.
 Make-up brushes of varying sizes and textures: Make-up
brushes are used to refine the leading edge to match the skin
tone in the final steps of the construction process. These
brushes refine the final product stroke by stroke.
 Styling tongs in various shapes and sizes: Tongs help shape
the hair to produce the desired hairstyle. The process of
shaping and styling the human hair wigs is the same process
used in salons for creating the style, shown in Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-2: The leading edge of a very expensive wig.

Styles range widely from gentle wavy to more radical, ornamental
hair styles. With the many options available, styling the wig is only
limited by the imagination of the buyer and the creative skills of
the wig maker, and the owner’s input is critical in this part of the
process.
Cosmetics help touch up the leading edge of the wig and blend the
hair with the person’s natural hair. Streaking a blonde or platinum
color to individual hairs can add that touch of luxury to the
styling.
Picking Up Your New Hair
You just got the call — your new hair has arrived! Nervous?
Excited? Scared about being seen in public for the first time? These
are all normal reactions as you open the package or head to the
shop to pick up your new hair replacement system.
Trying it on for size
If you had your head measured at a specialty shop, your new 
hair probably fits like a glove after a few minor adjustments. If 
you bought online, the measurements you provided determine 
the final product’s fit, and having adjustments done isn’t going to
be as easy. 
Attaching your hair easily
You can attach your wig to your head in a number of ways; you can
even have it grafted into your scalp! (We discuss specific ways to
attach hair replacement systems in Chapter 6.) Practice makes per-
fect; be involved in attaching your wig even in the store so that you
begin to get a feel for the process. Eventually, you’ll be able to
streamline your attaching routine.
Adjusting to wig wearing
Not everyone adjusts easily to wearing a hair replacement system.
If your first day with your new hair leaves you feeling self-conscious
and uncomfortable, you’re not alone. You may hold your head
funny because it feels unfamiliar on your head or walk more care-
fully because you’re worried about disturbing your ‘do’. You may
even feel like people can sense your discomfort. Give yourself time
to adjust; most new habits take time to adjust to, so be patient
when it comes to getting comfortable with your new look.
Chapter 7: Shopping for Hair Replacement Systems 131

Going Public with Your Hair
Walking out in public the first time with a new wig is a strange feel-
ing. You may feel self-conscious, but don’t fret — you and everyone
else will be used to your new hair in no time, and in the end it will
make you more confident rather than less. 
 Have an answer ready. You’re going to get questions if you’ve
suddenly grown a new head of hair overnight! If you’re the
boss at your workplace, you may not get direct questions, but
you can be sure you’ll be the object of conversation! Consider
beating everyone to the punch by bringing the topic up first.
 Consider a holiday. It may be easier to get away for a while
and get used to wearing the wig around people who didn’t
know you before you wore it. This tactic can give you time to
feel more comfortable and hence more confident about your
new look. Confidence is ever-critical in whatever you decide.

If you aren’t happy with your wig
If you’re not comfortable with your new hair after a few days or weeks, try to figure
out why. Consider the following questions:
 Is your hair system uncomfortable? Is it too hot, heavy, or itchy? 
 Are you sweating too much?
 Is the adhesive or attachment that you’re using uncomfortable?
 Are you self-conscious or worried about your wig falling off?
After you figure out exactly what’s bothering you, go back to the specialty shop
where you purchased it, or contact the shop if you bought it online. If it’s a problem
with comfort or the adhesive, you may be able to have the wig altered to correct
the problem. 
In a short time, the nerve endings on your scalp will get used to the feel of the wig
on your head, and you won’t even know you have it on. If you wear glasses, you
may remember how difficult it was to adjust to them in the beginning; something on
your head is just as hard to get used to at first.
As for self-consciousness, just give yourself time. Wearing a wig takes getting used
to, like everything else.

Caring For Your Wig
A hair replacement system is no different than your own hair; it
requires washing, styling, and sometimes even trimming. Your wig
will stay natural looking if you care for it properly, and in the next
sections, we tell you how.
Maintaining human hair wigs
You can style human hair wigs much like your natural hair, but
they do require care. We recommend using only styling tools such
as curling irons and rollers that are made specifically for wigs to
avoid causing unnecessary damage to the wig.
When cleaning your wig, start by removing the wig (very carefully!)
and any tangles with your fingers or a fine comb. Never apply
force. You can gently remove any stains with a toothbrush and
warm water. Wash the wig with shampoo, and always use condi-
tioner afterward. Human hair wigs can be washed more often than
synthetics, since their attachment to the mesh is more secure.
Never use a blow dryer or wring your wig dry. Always blot it with a
towel and then place it on its stand to dry.
Maintaining synthetic wigs
As we mention earlier in the chapter, you really can’t style or alter
the color of a synthetic wig, so your main maintenance task is
washing. How long you go between cleanings of your wig depends
largely on your lifestyle and environment. For normal wear, a good
rule of thumb to use is to wash and condition your wig every 15 to
20 uses or so.
If you work in an environment with more pollution, such as in a
restaurant where you’re exposed to kitchen grease or a place with
a lot of cigarette smoke, you may want to wash your wig more
often. You can also opt to have separate wigs for work and home.
In any case, if you wash your wig more than once a week, it won’t
last long.
Remember, the nose knows, and if your wig doesn’t smell fresh to
you, it doesn’t smell good to others around you either.
Chapter 7: Shopping for Hair Replacement Systems 133

Washing and cleaning is an art form for all wigs, particularly the
synthetic wig. Never use hot water — it can damage the synthetic
fibers. Lukewarm water is okay. Soaking the wig for a short period
of time and even using gentle steam may work, but don’t let too
much heat get to the wig.
Dry the wig with a towel. After it’s somewhat dry, you can use a
blow dryer, but very high heat settings can singe the edges, melt
the synthetic fiber or the foundation, and crack the filaments. Hot
rollers may also damage or melt the synthetic hair.
Wearing a Wig for Temporary 
Hair Loss
Wigs aren’t just used by balding men and women with thinning
hair. They can also be a valuable solution for people who have tem-
porary hair loss as a result of some medical conditions (such as
alopecia areata or cancer chemotherapy).
Dealing with a life-threatening illness is hard enough without
having to worry about losing your hair too. Some people who know
they’re going to be taking drugs that cause hair loss find it less
stressful to buy a wig before they start treatment. As soon as you
start to feel uncomfortable about you hair falling out, you’ve got
the wig handy.
Because hair loss caused by chemotherapy and other disease is
often temporary, you may feel that a less expensive synthetic wig
is adequate for your needs. Consider buying several to give your-
self a lift when you’re feeling down about your appearance.
Many insurance companies cover the cost of a wig used when hair
loss is the result of chemotherapy. Your doctor will probably need
to write a (carefully worded) letter to the insurance company
requesting the benefit; most insurance companies don’t cover the
cost of a “wig” but do cover a “hair prosthesis” or “cranial hair
prosthesis.” 
Some organizations recycle wigs for cancer patients at low or no
cost. The American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) may be able
to provide you with the name of an organization near you.

Concealing Hair Loss with
Fibers, Sprays, and More
In This Chapter
 Experimenting with styling possibilities
 Sprinkling on fibers and powders
 Spraying on your hair
 Looking at other ways to thicken your hair
 Using concealers after a hair transplant
W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could thicken your hair with just
the wave of a magic wand? Although we can’t tell you how
to pull a new head of hair out of a magician’s hat, in this chapter
we show you a few ways to pull some sleight of hand — or in this
case, head — by applying products such as spray-on fibers and
spray-on concealers and paint on masking products that give the
illusion of more hair without resorting to the expense of hairpieces
or hair transplants. 
You do, however, need to have some existing hair for these con-
cealers to work.
Styling Some Basic Hair
“Thickening” Tricks
Before you start spraying your hair or painting your scalp, try
some simple styling techniques to help conceal hair loss or thin-
ning. For example, get rid of the old comb-over that only empha-
sizes your hair loss and try a shorter cut to give the illusion of
more hair. Or just shave it all off so that it looks like bald is your
choice and not the result of failing hair follicles.

Hair and skin color can also play a subtle role in achieving the
appearance of fuller hair. A sharp contrast between the color of
your hair and the color of your skin will accentuate a thinning hair
line. You may not be thrilled with your graying hair, but gray hair
actually blends your hair and skin tones well, which results in your
hair appearing fuller. 
The combination of blond hair and fair skin makes your hair look
fuller than black hair and light skin. Many men and women choose
to color their hair to a lighter or darker color to bring down the
contrast between the hair and scalp color. Going blond is good, or
consider a slow transition to a sandy hair color if you have a light
skin tone. Platinum blond and glistening white hair reflect light,
making it more difficult to see through the hair to the scalp. Proper
use of hair dyes can produce such changes.
Keeping your hair shiny can help it appear fuller as well. The shine
allows the hair to reflect light better, whereas dull hair allows you
to see through to the scalp easier.
The added body of curls or waves in the hair can also help it
appear fuller. Some men and women who have naturally straight
hair perm it to achieve the appearance of more volume and full-
ness. Many women whose hair has begun thinning with age make
their hair appear fuller by perming, teasing, and lightening it (all of
which can cause damage; see Chapter 3 for more). Men are starting
to go this route as well.
Hair shaft thickness also plays an important role in styling and
imparting a fuller hair appearance. A coarse hair shaft provides
more coverage than finer hair. There are many hair thickeners
available and some shampoos and conditioners will also promote
thickening. Other products such as hair wax, pomades, horse tail
grooming products, and gels that can help your hair appear fuller
(see Chapter 3 for more on products).
Fooling Around with Fibers
Feel like shaking some new hair onto your head? It may not be as
good as the real thing, but topical products made of colored pro-
tein fibers can conceal hair thinning. These fibers, which come in
pepper shaker-type bottles, adhere to bases of the hair follicles
and the scalp, adding bulk to the hair shaft. See Figure 8-1.
These mostly stay in place by static electricity but fixing sprays
are available that add more holding power. The results can be dra-
matic, and the process is quick and easy.
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
136

Figure 8-1: Fiber products cling to the scalp and existing hair to conceal balding
areas.
Watching hair grow before 
your very eyes
There are many types of fiber products that can make hair shafts
thicker; two of the more well-known products are Toppik and
XFusion. These products are comprised of organic keratin fibers
with a similar chemical makeup to human hair. You apply the prod-
uct by spraying, painting, or sprinkling it on your scalp, where the
fibers cling to your existing hair and create an illusion of a thicker
and fuller hairline. The fibers stick to your existing hairs by static
electricity, so you don’t have to worry about it coming off. 
After the product is on your hair and scalp, it’s very difficult to
take off completely — except with a thorough hair wash. See 
Figure 8-2 for an example of a fiber product at work.
Chapter 8: Concealing Hair Loss with Fibers, Sprays, and More 137

Figure 8-2: Before and after pictures with Toppik fibers. 
Toppik and other hair fiber products should blend in with your
own the hair color, so choose the right color for the best results.
The subtle addition of the extra fibers will diminish any contrast
between your hair and scalp color. The drastic improvement also
comes from the fibers adhering to the fine vellus hairs — shorter
hairs which have little or no pigment — which can make your hair
look thicker. In all, it’s a great illusion.
Apply the product before you put on a white shirt. And remember
to comb through your hair to ensure the fibers are fixed firmly.
How well these products work depends on how much natural hair
you have to work with. They obviously won’t work very well if
you’re bald or nearly bald with only a few hairs. In that case, a lim-
ited hair transplant can give you enough hair to use this product
successfully. These products are excellent for making a hair trans-
plant look fuller and may forestall more surgeries.
The problem with most fiber concealers is that they may not work
at the hairline, but with a template placed slightly behind where
the thin hair starts, you can create a reasonable illusion of a frontal
hairline. Both Toppik and Xfusion offer spray applicators which
can be used with their hairline templates. 
Facing the elements
Any time you apply something to your head, it’s normal to worry
about it coming off at an inopportune moment, which can lead to
embarrassing situations.
Fiber products are pretty difficult to disengage (depending upon
the manufacturer), with the following caveats:
 A light rain won’t affect fiber products because the fibers
don’t dissolve in water. But getting caught in a monsoon and
being literally drenched in water may be a different story.
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
138

 Wind shouldn’t affect the fiber concealer because static
electricity keeps the fibers clinging to your existing hair.
However, we wouldn’t stick our heads out of the car going 60
mph to test this theory, and you probably shouldn’t either.
 If you sweat heavily, some products will not run, while
others may. Try not to run your fingers through your hair in
public (or let someone else do it!) if you’re not confident in
the product you are using; test your fiber concealer at home
(rather than in public) to see just how far you can push it with
a sweaty head or with your fingers running through your hair.
If you still worry that the fibers may shed or loosen and cause an
embarrassing fallout, you can always use hair spray for that addi-
tional safety cushion. 
Some ‘fiberhold’ products are made by the companies that make
these concealer products just for that purpose. Practice with the
product you choose so there’ll be no surprises. 
Making fiber cover ups part 
of your routine
The obvious point of using any form of applied concealer to mask
baldness is that it’s temporary. It may be a quick fix to your prob-
lem, but it’s only a short-term solution to a long-term problem.
However, the sad reality about balding is that once it starts, the
chances of returning to a full head of hair are almost nil. So when
you start concealing your vanishing hair line, it’s likely to be a part
of your daily grooming routine for the rest of your life.
You may get to a point where you become addicted to the product
because it can make such a dramatic difference in your appear-
ance. Unlike other addictions, this one isn’t a bad thing, really. The
product can be miraculously undetectable as long as you have
enough hair for the fibers to cling to. 
However, as you go through the balding process and lose more
hair, you may come to a point when the fibers may be visible to the
discriminating eye. At that point, you may have to give up the
fibers and deal with thin hair that looks even thinner because you
no longer can use the fibers to conceal the thinning effectively.
This is when it’s a particularly good idea to look at alternatives. 
As we mention earlier in this chapter, even a limited hair trans-
plant can give you enough fibers to continue to use the product. 
Chapter 8: Concealing Hair Loss with Fibers, Sprays, and More 139

Taking the time to apply the product
One of the problems with fiber concealers is that they can be time
consuming to use. Toppik, for example, boasts of a 30-second
application time and when you become experienced with it, you
may find that estimate to be accurate. But it doesn’t include the
time it takes to style your hair and wash out the fibers at the end of
the day.
Whether you can apply Toppik in only 30 seconds is debatable
because different people have different needs based on how much
hair they currently have. Obviously, the less hair you have, the
longer it will take to apply and the more important your skill in
applying the product will be.
Spray-on Hair
Who doesn’t remember those hair-in-a-can ads on TV in years
past? Although those made-for-TV products were the butt of many
jokes, the concept made sense.
The goal of many of these spray on solutions is to darken your
scalp to the color of your hair and fill out your thinning hair to
make your scalp disappear. The original products may have been
laughable, but now there’s a new generation of colored sprays. The
best known is Fullmore. It uses aerosol propellant to spray tiny
color-matched fibers that cling to your existing hair and darken
your scalp. 
Sprays are quick to use and offer probably the fastest way to cam-
ouflage large areas, but you need some hair to have them work
well. On the downside, they’re not as precise as dab-on concealers,
and not quite as natural in appearance with keratin fibers like
Toppik in an area with more natural hair still left. 
You apply products like Fullmore by holding the spray can around
eight inches from your head and spraying while moving the can
around for an even result. Put a towel on your shoulders to avoid
any overspray. The results are quick, if not quite as convincing as
fibers.
Be careful when going out in the rain, as there is some run-off
potential in downpours.
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
140

After application, you should apply a FiberHold Spray (designed to
bond fibers to hair) or a good hair spray. Once sealed, the product
won’t flake or come off, and you can brush through it without
worry. It will not blow out in the wind or run from perspiration.
Like all other concealers, it washes out with vigorous shampooing. 
Feeling like the real thing
Face it: As much as the chemical makeup of fiber concealers is sim-
ilar to human hair, the actual feel and texture of fibers on your hair
may not be the same as a real, thick, full head of hair. Fibers tend
to be finer than human hair, which can lead to flyaway hairs under
certain conditions (which you should test in private; see the ear-
lier section, “Facing the elements”).
You may be self-conscious about how the fibers look and feel on
your head and therefore constantly worry about your hair. And
heaven forbid if someone you’re dating wants to run their fingers
through your fibrous hairs — be very careful about that no touch
zone!
Applying Foundation
Using a fiber concealer to add fullness to your remaining hair still
leaves you with another problem: covering your hairless scalp. If
you’re an artist, you may have contemplated painting a hair scene
on your balding head. Fortunately, you don’t have to be artistic to
apply foundation makeup made specifically to cover shiny bald
skin and blend the scalp color with the hair color.
Coloring your head
Foundations that conceal hair loss are best compared to women’s
cosmetic foundation or pressed powder. Essentially, foundation for
your scalp is created from coloring and emollients (moisturizers)
and is applied in much the same way that foundation is applied to
the face.
What foundation does is conceal the whiter or lighter parts of your
scalp. This masks your hairline, making it look as though your hair
isn’t thinning because the scalp coloring is brought closer to your
hair color.
Chapter 8: Concealing Hair Loss with Fibers, Sprays, and More 141

Like fiber concealers, scalp foundation will only work to conceal
thinning hair if you have hair in the area to begin with. This mate-
rial can’t be used on the hairline to address your hairline prob-
lems; the hairline is a separate beast you have to deal with.
Using a sponge applicator, you simply shade in parts of your scalp
where your hairline is thinning.
Accepting the limitations
One of the problems with foundation products is that they don’t
add fullness to your actual hair like fiber products do. However,
foundations do reduce the visibility of the scalp through what hair
you have, and this effect may work well if you just have minor thin-
ning. But if you have a relatively large area that needs covering, a
foundation may leave you with an imbalance of hair to scalp ratio.
Hair systems (see Chapter 7) or hair transplants may be the only
option for those without enough hair.
Using a foundation can actually expose your thinning hair (at least
to yourself) because a close look in a good light, like the bathroom,
may reveal the painted-on look between the hairs. 
You can combine foundation products with fiber concealers,
thereby tackling both the hair and the scalp imbalance. This works
when the amount of hair that you have isn’t quite enough for the
fiber sprays. The foundation darkens the scalp enough so that it
doesn’t show through after you use the fiber sprays like Toppik to
thicken the hair that you still have. 
Taking the time to paint
As with fiber concealers, foundations can take some time to apply. You
may find it easier to apply over a wider area, painting with broad
strokes, but precision control of specific spots may be more difficult. If
you use a fiber in combination with the foundation, then the foundation
should be laid down first.
The hair you have is always styled after you apply the foundation and
before the fibers are used. Many foundation users find that they don’t
have to put it on every day. Some of the products may even last through
a shampoo.
Scalp foundations are a temporary fix to a long-term problem. Certainly,
masking and concealing something that may be a source of insecurity is
one way of coping with the problem at hand. However, you should keep
in mind that there’s no longevity to this solution; you have to do it again
every day or every other day, depending upon your own situation.

Trying Thickeners
Do hair thickeners work? Yes, they do! But their effects are only temporary, and
they have some limitations. Some men who are thinning use wax and pomade
to make their hair look fuller. These products are the same as those that were
so popular in the 1950s when the popular style for young men was slicked
back hair.
In addition to achieving the slick look, these products also add extra thickness
to your hair and provide the feeling and appearance of fullness.
A thicker hair shaft increases the fullness of one’s hair exponentially. Even
small increments of added thickness can have a major impact on the fullness of
the hair (refer to the section, “Fooling Around with Fibers,” earlier in this chap-
ter for products that increase hair shaft fullness). Doubling the thickness of a
single hair will increase the overall bulk fourfold. So, thickening each and every
hair shaft may produce four times more bulk than having more hair!
Medications such as Propecia works so well for much the same reason.
Propecia not only has the potential to grow new hair, but it also thickens tiny
miniaturized hair to provide more coverage. You can read more about drugs
such as Propecia in Chapter 9.
Some shampoos and conditioners can also make your hair look thicker by
leaving a thin film of nutrients and oils on each hair strand. The film makes
each hair fiber look shiny and healthy, which certainly can give your hair
bounce and a feeling of fullness. 
Part III: Creative Techniques for Concealing Hair Loss 
144

Some products also hydrate the hair shafts, adding increments of volume to
them as they swell from absorbing water. But these products have limitations
when your hair is thinning and you don’t have enough to build upon as a foun-
dation.
In short, the hair thickeners don’t provide the dramatic results of fiber and
powder concealers. Hair thickeners work best if you have very early thinning
and lots of thinner hairs.
Using Concealers after 
a Hair Transplant
The impact of concealing agents can be remarkable, but they don’t
work in a bald frontal area or places where there’s just not enough
hair to work with. If you decide on a hair transplant to supply
some needed hair, the concealing agents can work for a lifetime
because the hair from a hair transplant lasts a lifetime.
Concealers that darken the scalp work well with transplants even if
there’s either not enough hair or enough money to cover the whole
head with transplanted hair. Figure 8-3 shows a man who would
have been completely bald had he not had hair transplants.
Unfortunately, he didn’t have enough donor hair to get the fullness
he wanted, so he applied a concealing foundation to his scalp.
Figure 8-3: Top view of a post-transplant patient without (a) and with concealer
(b); back view without (c) and with concealer (d).
Note that the see-through appearance in the first and third pic-
tures in Figure 8-3 show the thinning that the concealer masks in
the second and fourth pictures. The hair transplant gave this
patient his frontal hairline back, and with concealers and a combed
back hairstyle that gives the illusion of more hair he has achieved
his hair restoration goal and is a happy camper with minimal
inconvenience. 
Combinations of hair thickeners, hair fibers, scalp coloring, and
hair transplants can contribute greatly to achieving the goals of an
illusion of hair when, in fact, the hair isn’t all there.

T
ake a pill, grow your hair back. Sounds like a winning arrange-
ment, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, although a few prescription
medications can help with specific types of hair loss, the magic
hair pill has yet to be invented.
In this chapter, we look at prescription drugs that help with hair
loss, drugs that may help some people some of the time (and that
may include you), and drugs that are of no help whatsoever.
Managing Expectations
People generally expect miracles from prescription medications,
and medications touted for hair loss are no exception. It’s important
to recognize the capabilities and limitations of medical treatments
for hair loss therapies before you start using one. What topical (the
ones you pour on your head) and oral drugs can do is stop hair loss
in some people and sometimes regrow hair in areas that aren’t yet
totally bald. What they can’t do is regrow all the hair you’ve lost.
Hair that you lost many years ago isn’t likely to start growing. If
you’re satisfied with the idea of stopping hair loss and perhaps
experiencing some mild regrowth, then you may be very happy

with the results of taking some medications. But if you expect to
regain the flowing locks you had in your teens, then you’re sure to
be disappointed.
Be patient when starting pharmaceutical hair loss treatment.
Results take many months, not days or weeks. You must commit to
treatment for at least one year to know if you’re truly going to see
any real benefit for pharmaceutical treatment. Remember, hair
grows slowly, and it will take a considerable amount of time before
you notice a difference.
Always use the medication as prescribed — whether that’s once
daily, twice a day, or what ever regime your doctor prescribes for
the best possible chance of results. If you stop using the medicine,
you can expect to lose all the hair that you may have gained from
this therapy as well as any hair you would have lost while you
were on the therapy, but luckily not more. After about six months
your hair will look as if you’d never used the medication, and you’ll
resume losing hair at your natural rate.
The thought of taking a pill or using a solution on your scalp daily
forever may seem discouraging. However, we encourage patients
not to think of it that way. You can always decide at some point in
the future that hair isn’t as important to you as it once was and
stop using the medicine. 
In addition, it’s possible that the future will bring better treatments
for hair loss and perhaps a permanent cure. People use medication
regularly for all kinds of conditions, such as high blood pressure or
cholesterol, and it just becomes part of the daily routine. In time,
the same is true with hair loss prescription medication.
Inhibiting DHT with Finasteride
(Propecia)
One of the few prescription medications that really works to
replace hair lost from male pattern baldness is finasteride, more
commonly known as Propecia. Here we describe why it works and
for whom; we also get into some of the side effects and the pros
and cons of taking the drug so that you can make an informed deci-
sion with your doctor.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
150

How finasteride works
As we explain in Chapter 4, male pattern baldness (androgenetic
alopecia in medical lingo) is caused by the effects of the male hor-
mone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on genetically susceptible hair
follicles predominantly in the front, top, and crown of the scalp
(not the back and sides).
DHT causes hair loss by shortening the growth phase of the hair
cycle, which leads to a decreased size (thickness) or miniaturiza-
tion of the follicles. The affected hair grows more slowly or stops
growing completely and progressively evolves into a shorter and
finer hair until it eventually disappears.
Two of the male sex hormones are testosterone and dihydrotestos-
terone (DHT). Cells in the body metabolize testosterone and turn it
into DHT. The traffic cop that supervises this process is an enzyme
called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). The two types of 5AR are
Chapter 9: Turning to Prescription Medications for Hair Loss 151
The discovery of finasteride
There’s a common misconception that finasteride was first conceived as a prostate
medication and was coincidentally found to prevent hair loss. The reality is that in
1974, researchers described a group of male children from the Dominican Republic
who were deficient in the enzyme 5-alpha reductase (5AR). These male children
had very low levels of DHT, and throughout their lives, their prostates remained small
and they didn’t develop male pattern hair loss or acne.
The scientists’ goal was to find a drug that could block the 5AR enzyme and mimic the
abnormality found in these boys. The scientists then could use this drug to prevent
both prostate enlargement and hair loss. A deliberate (business) decision was made
to seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its use in treating prostate
enlargement (a medical condition) rather than hair loss (a cosmetic problem).
In 1992, 5 mg finasteride was released under the brand name Proscar for use in men
over 50 with prostate enlargement. Some men taking Proscar noted hair growth in
balding or bald areas of their scalps. Scientific studies were done to determine if this
drug would reduce the balding process and possibly grow hair. Varying doses of
finasteride were tested to determine the safest and most effective dose for the treat-
ment of hair loss, and in 1997, the FDA approved finasteride 1 mg per day (Propecia)
for the treatment of male pattern baldness.

 Type I is located mainly in sebaceous (sweat) glands, ker-
atinocytes, and fibroblasts. Its exact role in hair growth has
not been determined. This enzyme catalizes the conversion of
testosterone into androstenedione (another hormone) which
seems to be related to the production of sebum. The role of
Type II 5AR in hair loss is not well defined. 
 Type II is found in the skin and the sheath of hair follicles on
the scalp. This form of the enzyme seems to cause hair loss in
those with the gene for hair loss, and can be blocked by the
actions of drugs like finasteride. 
The drug finasteride makes 5AR work less effectively, reducing the
body’s ability to produce DHT. When you take the drug orally, it
reaches the bloodstream and the scalp hair follicles, where it
decreases the amount of DHT made in the hair follicles.
Finasteride at the 1 milligram per day dose has been clinically
shown to decrease serum DHT levels by almost 70 percent.
Although many professionals falsely think that finasteride lowers a
man’s testosterone level, in fact, on average finasteride causes a
rise in serum testosterone levels by 9 percent, although this is still
within the normal range.
Testing the efficacy of finasteride
Propecia is the brand name for finasteride at the 1 mg dose, and
it’s proven to be very effective in the treatment of common pattern
hair loss. Studies have shown that after five years of treatment,
almost half of men treated with Propecia demonstrated an increase
in hair growth, and 90 percent of men maintained most of their hair
in previous thinning areas over this time period. Only 10 percent
were rated as having lost hair when compared to their baseline
hair measurements. In those not taking the drug, 75 percent were
rated as having lost hair during the course of the study.
One mg finasteride can help you to preserve the hair you’ve got at
any age, but it works best for hair regrowth in younger patients or
those who have had recent hair loss in the past two to three years.
Occasionally, people over age 50 see regrowth of some hair with
finasteride, but this is the exception rather than the rule.
It’s important to know that finasteride will only work as long as
you’re taking it. Within two to six months of discontinuing treat-
ment with finasteride, the previous hair loss pattern will generally
return to its state as if the medication had never been used.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
152

Although many doctors will tell you that finasteride doesn’t work
for balding in the frontal area of the scalp, the FDA did approve it
for this type of hair loss (see Chapter 18 for more on the FDA).
Many people who have had early thinning in the frontal scalp may
regrow hair if they start finasteride early in the thinning process.
DHT causes frontal hair loss, and finasteride blocks the DHT
impact on the loss of hair, but if there’s no hair in the fontal area at
all, you shouldn’t expect any to appear.
You must take finasteride for at least one full year before your
doctor can accurately determine its effects. During the first six
months, you may note some thinning of existing hair as the new
growing hair replaces the sickly miniaturized hair, so it’s important
to be patient during this period.
Does finasteride work for women?
There’s some controversy on whether finasteride is effective in
women. One study evaluating the efficacy of finasteride in post-
menopausal women was terminated after one year with no signifi-
cant hair growth.
Another study evaluated the effectiveness of the combination of a
higher dose of oral finasteride (2.5 mg) with an oral contraceptive.
This study only included perimenopausal women with pattern hair
loss. After one year, 62 percent of the women in this study demon-
strated some decrease of hair loss. 
It’s not clear if the success was due to the dosage (2.5 mg instead
of 1 mg used in the previous study); the combination of use with
an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone, which also has an
effect on hair loss; or the fact that this study looked at peri-
menopausal instead of postmenopausal females. The study group
was too small to determine safety from a statistical point of view.
Finasteride has not been approved for women. In addition, women
shouldn’t handle crushed or broken Propecia tablets when they’re
pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility
of absorption through the skin and the subsequent potential risk
to a male fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, there
appears to be no risk to the fetus if a man taking finasteride
impregnates a woman.
As of this writing, finasteride isn’t recommended for women to
treat pattern hair loss. Further studies are needed to better under-
stand which women may respond to treatment before its use can
be advocated, and safety issues (including a possibility of
increased risk of breast cancer) also need further investigation.
Chapter 9: Turning to Prescription Medications for Hair Loss 153

What are finasteride’s side effects?
Side effects from Propecia at the standard 1 mg daily dose are rare,
and fortunately if they do occur, they’re not permanent.
In a study of men taking finasteride 1 mg, around 2 to 4 percent
experienced some form of sexual dysfunction (decreased libido,
erectile dysfunction, or decreased volume of ejaculate) compared
to just over 2 percent of men treated with a placebo. For those men
who reported cases of sexual dysfunction soon after starting the
medication, it appeared generally within months. A small number
of men saw a change in their libido or sexual function months or
years into taking the drug.
You’ll be happy to know that the sexual side effects were reversed
in all men who discontinued therapy (and in 58 percent of those
who continued treatment, the sexual side effects returned to their
normal premedication levels). After the medication was stopped,
all sexual side effects generally disappeared within a few weeks.
If you experience negative sexual side effects, you should consult
with your doctor about stopping the medication until the side
effects go away and then restarting at a lower dose (either a quar-
ter or half of a 1 mg pill a day). If you have no side effects after sev-
eral weeks on the lower dose, you can work back up to the 1 mg
per day dose. Even staying on a lower dose will offer some benefit,
but if side effects occur at the lower dose, it may be time to quit
therapy with this medication.
Another rare side effect to be aware of is breast tenderness or
breast enlargement (in males this is called gynecomastia). This
occurred in 0.4 percent of men on finasteride 1 mg but was no
greater than in the control group. In men who developed gyneco-
mastia, the appearance of breast cancer was slightly higher than in
the control group, although this connection may not be statisti-
cally significant.
Other side effects that were no more common than those experi-
enced in patients taking a placebo included rash, itching, hives,
swelling of the lips and face, and testicular pain. Some rare cases of
mood changes have also been reported. There have been no inter-
actions between finasteride 1 mg and any other drugs reported at
the time of this writing.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
154

Checking finasteride’s effects 
on the prostate
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels are used to screen for
prostate enlargement and prostate cancer. Finasteride causes a
decrease in PSA blood levels by approximately 50 percent in
healthy men; therefore, it’s important that your doctor know if
you’re taking finasteride so that he or she may take this into
account when interpreting your PSA results.
A study in 2003 on 5 mg finasteride reported that men treated with
5 mg finasteride for seven years had a 25 percent reduction in
prostate cancer compared to men treated with placebo. The
authors concluded that 5 mg finasteride prevents or delays the
appearance of prostate cancer and that this possible benefit and a
reduced risk of urinary problems must be weighed against sexual
side effects and the remote possible increased risk of more aggres-
sive prostate cancer.
Men aged 50 or over should inform their regular physicians or urol-
ogists if they’re taking Finasteride 1 mg to treat hair loss. It’s also
recommended that all men aged 50 or over have routine annual
evaluations for prostate disease, regardless of whether or not
they’re on Finasteride 1 mg. (African Americans or patients with a
family history of prostate disease should start annuals exams at
age 40.) An evaluation may include a rectal examination, a baseline
PSA, and other tests that the physician feels are appropriate.
Proper dosing of finasteride
If your doctor prescribes finasteride to treat your hair loss, it’s
best to take the recommended dose of 1 mg per day as long as you
have no side effects. Lower doses have been shown to be effective,
but less so. There’s also little evidence that a higher dose helps,
although some doctors may increase the dose under certain cir-
cumstances. Studies don’t yet show statistically valid connections
between a higher dose of finasteride for the treatment of hair loss
in men.
The 5 mg dose of finasteride now available in generic form is
cheaper than five doses of Finasteride 1 mg. (The brand name of
the 5 mg dose is Proscar.) You can use a pill cutter to divide the 5
mg tablet into approximately four pieces. Taking one piece every
day is equivalent to 1.25 mg per day, but be advised that there’s no
scientific data ensuring that this is as effective as finasteride 1 mg. 
Chapter 9: Turning to Prescription Medications for Hair Loss 155

Also, remember that there’s a potential risk to pregnant women
from handling broken or crushed tablets as finasteride can be
absorbed through the skin.
Finasteride 1 mg isn’t affected by food, so you can take it any time
during the day without regard to meals. Taking it in the morning
may have an advantage, though, because testosterone levels are
highest in the morning in most men.
Combining finasteride and minoxidil
Finasteride and minoxidil (brand name Rogaine; see the section,
“Stimulating Hair Growth with Minoxodil,” later in this chapter)
have an increased effect if taken together because they work differ-
ently. Finasteride permits hair growth by blocking the negative
effects of DHT, whereas minoxidil stimulates the hair follicle
directly. Of the two, finasteride is far more effective. There are no
contradictions to taking the two together, and you may see better
results by taking both regularly.
Dutasteride — Another 
Inhibitor of DHT
In 2002, the FDA approved a drug called Avodart (dutasteride 0.5
mg) for the treatment of prostate enlargement in men, but the drug
also works to inhibit DHT and therefore permit hair growth. This
section helps you understand dutasteride and how it may be able
to treat your hair loss.
Dutasteride isn’t approved specifically for the treatment of male
pattern hair loss, and there are no long-term studies assessing its
safety and efficacy in hair loss, although short-term study results
have been promising.
How dutasteride works
Like finasteride, dutasteride inhibits the enzyme 5AR, which is
responsible for the conversion of testosterone to DHT. However,
unlike finasteride, which only inhibits one type of the enzyme,
dutasteride inhibits both types, making the drug possibly more
potent but also increasing the incidence of adverse reactions and
side effects.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
156

A dosage of dutasteride 0.5 mg per day decreases serum DHT 91
percent and scalp DHT 54 percent. In comparison, 5 mg finasteride
decreases serum DHT 71 percent and scalp DHT 38 percent. Based
on these numbers, you may expect dutasteride to be more effec-
tive in the treatment of male pattern hair loss than finasteride.
However, because the type of 5AR that dutasteride blocks isn’t
present in significant quantities in the hair follicle, the effects may
not significant. Further studies are needed to answer this impor-
tant question of which is more effective: dutasteride or finasteride.
Assessing the efficacy of dutasteride
Only a couple of studies have examined the effectiveness of dutas-
teride for pattern hair loss.
In 2007, a study was published that compared the efficacy of dutas-
teride to that of placebo in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia
in 17 pairs of identical twin males over a one-year period. One twin
from each pair received dutasteride 0.5 mg/day for 12 months
while the other received placebo.
At the end of the study 15 of the 17 sets of twins correctly guessed
which one was using dutasteride. The investigators concluded that
dutasteride significantly improves hair growth and reduces hair
loss progression in men with male pattern hair loss.
In 2006, a larger study was conducted with 416 men. The partici-
pants received either dutasteride (in doses of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 or 2.5
mg), finasteride 5 mg, or placebo daily for 24 weeks. The investiga-
tors found that dutasteride increased area hair count versus
placebo, with the level of success depending on the dosage.
In addition, dutasteride 2.5 mg was superior to finasteride 5 mg at
12 and 24 weeks. Scalp and serum dihydrotestosterone levels
decreased, and testosterone levels increased, both with the level
of success depending on the dosage. A major limitation of this
study was that it was limited to only 24 weeks.
What are dutasteride’s side effects?
Dutasteride has a greater incidence of sexual side effects com-
pared to finasteride (refer to the earlier section “What are finas-
teride’s side effects?”). Dutasteride was investigated in controlled
multicenter studies involving men aged 50 and above with prostate
enlargement. Drug-related side effects during the first six months
included impotence (at 4.7 percent, the highest percentage of
Chapter 9: Turning to Prescription Medications for Hair Loss 157

occurrence), decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, and breast
tenderness and breast enlargement (at 0.5 percent, the lowest per-
centage of occurrence). 
The good news is that most drug-related sexual side effects
decreased with time in this study. However, drug-related breast
tenderness and breast enlargement remained constant over the
treatment period.
In recent cases, dutasteride has caused significant drops in sperm
count, which could result in problems with male fertility.
As with finasteride, dutasteride reduces the amount of PSA meas-
ured in the blood, which must be taken into account when PSA
levels are used in the detection of prostate cancer. Women who are
pregnant or may become pregnant shouldn’t handle dutasteride
because of the possibility of absorbing it through the skin and sub-
sequent potential risk to a male fetus.
Dutesteride hangs around in your bloodstream much longer that
finasteride does; the half-life of dutasteride is five weeks compared
to six to eight hours for finasteride, and blood tests can detect
dutasteride in your system up to four to six months after you stop
taking the drug. Therefore, you shouldn’t donate blood until at
least six months after you final dose of dutasteride to prevent
giving it to a pregnant woman through a blood transfusion.
At the time of this writing, dutasteride is being researched in an
approved FDA format. This study is expected to address all the
issues concerning safety and effectiveness of dutasteride as well as
the side effects mentioned in this chapter. Stay tuned and talk to
your doctor.
Stimulating Hair Growth 
with Minoxidil
The first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of hair loss
was topical minoxidil, also known by the brand name Rogaine.
Rogaine is a topical solution that’s applied directly to the scalp.
Originally available only with a doctor’s prescription, it’s now avail-
able over-the-counter as both Rogaine and generic minoxidil solu-
tion, and it comes in concentrations of 5 percent for men and 2
percent for women. Recently, Rogaine developed a new minoxidil
formulation in a 5 percent topical foam. This product is less greasy
and easier to apply for some people.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
158

How minoxidil works
Before minoxidil was available topically, it was an oral blood pres-
sure medication. Doctors observed that many people taking oral
minoxidil not only had a decrease in blood pressure but began
growing body hair as well. It was reasoned that applying minoxidil
directly to a bald scalp may cause hair to grow in this area without
producing the side effects of the oral medication. Researchers
developed a topical formulation, and studies showed modest hair
growth on the scalp.
Just how minoxidil works in hair growth is unknown. The drug is a
vasodilator (vasodilators cause the blood vessels to dilate, or
expand) and may increase the flow of blood to the hair follicle, but
how this relates to hair loss is unclear. In addition, minoxidil also
increases the duration of the hair follicle growth cycle and
improves the quality of the hair by increasing the diameter and
length of fine, miniaturized hair.
How effective is minoxidil and on
which areas of the scalp?
The original studies on minoxidil were performed on the crown of
the head, so there’s a misconception that it only works in this area.
Although minoxidil may work best in the crown area, it also works
to a lesser degree in other areas as long as there’s some fine
(miniaturized) hair (such as at the front of the scalp). However, it
doesn’t work if the area is totally bald.
The greatest benefit from minoxidil is visible between six months
to two years from the beginning of treatment. After this time, you
see a gradual decrease in effectiveness, so you’ll continue to lose
hair, but at a slower rate than if you weren’t on the drug.
The effectiveness of minoxidil to treat men with pattern hair loss
has been investigated since the mid-1980s and is well established.
Even though both 5 percent and 2 percent solutions have been
shown to decrease hair loss and increase hair, the 5 percent solu-
tion seems to work better.
If you stop using minoxidil, the effects wear off within three months,
and the previous pattern of hair loss resumes. When you restart it,
you generally don’t regain the hair that was lost, so it’s best not to
stop and start the mediation but rather to use it regularly.
Chapter 9: Turning to Prescription Medications for Hair Loss 159

Does minoxidil work for women?
Yes, minoxidil works for women with pattern hair loss, but only the
2 percent concentration of minoxidil has been approved for their
use. In 1994, a study was conducted in which 256 women with
androgenic alopecia used 2 percent minoxidil twice daily for 32
weeks. At the end of the study, the investigators found that 60 per-
cent of the patients in the 2 percent minoxidil group reported new
hair growth compared with 40 percent of the patients in the
placebo group.
The investigators concluded that minoxidil is an effective treat-
ment for pattern hair loss in women but that it doesn’t work on all
patients.
Although the 2 percent minoxidil solution is the only approved
dose in women, there’s evidence that the 5 percent solution may
be superior. In 2004, a study with 381 female patients with pattern
hair loss was conducted comparing 5 percent minoxidil with 2 per-
cent minoxidil. Both strengths were shown to help regrow hair, but
the 5 percent topical minoxidil group demonstrated superiority
over the 2 percent group.
What are minoxodil’s side effects?
By far the most common side effect of topical minoxidil is local irri-
tation, although the foam formulation is much less irritating than
the original version.
Another side effect sometimes seen in women is the development
of facial hair. Although this may decrease when the medication is
discontinued, at times the hair may need to be removed after treat-
ment with either electrolysis or lasers. To reduce the chances of
this problem (although you can’t eliminate it entirely), you should
be careful when applying minoxidil and try to avoid the medication
dripping down onto the temples and forehead, unless, of course, a
hairy forehead is the look you’re going for! (Although the 2 percent
solution is standard for women, there’s a significantly greater inci-
dence of this side effect when the 5 percent solution is used.)
Female patients also seem to be more sensitive to the potential
systemic side effects of minoxidil in decreasing blood pressure 
(a condition called hypotension). Rarely women may get light-
headed (a symptom of low blood pressure) from topically applying
minoxidil. Women also have an increased risk of developing 
allergic skin reactions on the scalp.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
160

It is important to know that minoxidil can cause birth defects.
Women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nurs-
ing shouldn’t use this medication.
Comparing minoxidil to finasteride
Studies have demonstrated that minoxidil is an inferior treatment
for male pattern hair loss compared to finasteride. In 2004, a study
was conducted in which male androgenetic alopecia patients used
either 1 mg oral finasteride or 5 percent topical minoxidil twice
daily for one year. Eighty percent of the men using finasteride and
52 percent of those using minoxidil had an increase in hair density.
The study demonstrated that while both medications are effective,
finasteride is superior. Additional studies have shown that the
combination of finasteride with minoxidil is superior to finasteride
alone, which suggests a synergistic effect, meaning that two med-
ications together work better than either medication used alone.
Applying minoxidil
Doctors recommend that you apply minoxidil directly to the scalp
(not the hair) twice a day. In order to regain lost hair, you need to
apply the solution to all thinning areas, including the frontal hair-
line and temples.
Once a day topical use of minoxidil is probably almost as effective
as twice a day use because it has a long half-life of almost 24 hours.
Once a day dosing is a reasonable option if it’s not practical for
you to apply it twice daily.
In fact, a study in 2007 showed that using a combination of 5 percent
minoxidil and 0.01 percent tretinoin (a cream that makes the minoxi-
dil penetrate the scalp better) once a day was equivalent conven-
tional 5 percent minoxidil twice-daily therapy for the treatment of
pattern hair loss in men. 
One caveat is that topical tretinoin can sometimes be irritating to
the scalp and may increase the amount of minoxidil entering the
bloodstream, which could result in unwanted side effects (covered
in the earlier section, “What are minoxidil’s side effects?”).
Chapter 9: Turning to Prescription Medications for Hair Loss 161

Medications for Women Only
Two prescription medications for women with pattern hair loss
deserve special mention: spironolactone and cyproterone acetate.
Both are anti-androgens, meaning they suppress the actions of
testosterone, and have been studied in women to treat female pat-
tern hair loss. These medications should be used by women only;
for men, they cause decreased sex drive and other unacceptable
side effects.
Spironolactone
Spironolactone (brand name Aldactone) is an oral diuretic (or
water pill) that’s FDA-approved to treat congestive heart failure
and high blood pressure. The drug also has been shown in a few
small studies to help reduce unwanted hair in females and has
been studied in women with pattern hair loss — but with mixed
results. It may have some effect in reducing thinning in women
with very limited pattern hair loss.
Spironolactone has been associated with an increased risk of
bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, although a definite link
hasn’t been established. It isn’t used in men because it can cause
testicular atrophy and breast enlargement as well as decreased
sexual function.
Cyproterone acetate
Because it’s an anti-androgen (anti-androgens block the effects of
male hormones in women), cyproterone acetate should be used
only by women. A few studies have been published documenting
mild effectiveness of cyproterone acetate in the treatment of both
hirsutism (excessive hairiness) and female pattern hair loss. It’s
available in combination with estrogen for use as an oral contra-
ceptive in Europe, but it’s not FDA-approved and not available in
the U.S.
The most serious potential side effect of cyproterone acetate is
liver toxicity; the drug also has been linked to increased rate of
blood clots.

Supplementing Your Diet to
Help Slow Hair Loss
In This Chapter
 Eating healthy to preserve and protect your hair
 Exploring alternative hair loss treatments: Oils and herbs
 Staying informed about unproven hair loss treatment ingredients
E
verything in your body — including your hair — maintains its
health and vitality thanks to what you put into it. Can you
avoid baldness forever by consuming enough protein, vitamins,
and minerals? Probably not (forever is a tall order, after all), but
you may be able to slow or avoid hair loss caused by nutritional
deficiencies — and you can keep the hair you have looking healthy
and at its best.
In this chapter, we start with the big picture of how diet and nutri-
tion affect hair. Then we explain the affects of various vitamins and
minerals and look at ancient remedies for hair loss and the treat-
ments still used today in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine. 
Although there hasn’t been a great deal of scientific research into
whether herbs and oils delay or prevent hair loss, the treatments
we describe have been used for many years in alternative medi-
cine. We also warn you about treatments that don’t work — and
that could be harmful to your health.
Eating Your Way to Healthy Hair
Everybody knows that eating well is essential for a healthy heart,
bones, and other key body systems, but you may not realize that a
lack of protein, good fat, vitamins, and minerals can affect what
grows out of the top of your head as well. Hair needs to be fed —
and fed well — to keep growing and to stay put. A steady diet of
junk food isn’t healthy fodder for your hair.

People who don’t eat meat or dairy products may be missing out
on important vitamins and minerals necessary for hair health.
Pumping up calories and proteins
It’s well documented that a diet deficient in calories or protein can
contribute to hair loss or hair that doesn’t look healthy and
vibrant. For example, patients with anorexia nervosa, a disease in
which the patient consumes too few calories to sustain good
health, often experience hair loss. Hair without good luster doesn’t
feel good when you run your fingers through it, or it may be brittle
and break off easily — all may reflect a nutritional problem with
your diet.
You can get most of the amino acids your body needs from a
proper, well-balanced diet, but others are harder to absorb from
the diet, especially as you get older. For some people, protein sup-
plements may have a beneficial affect on hair growth.
Adequate protein intake is critical for hair growth including amino
acids, which include lysine, arginine, cystine, cysteine, and methio-
nine. These amino acids are created by the body from the proteins
we eat. If you eat protein rich foods, you get enough of these essen-
tial amino acids, but if you don’t, supplements may provide some
of them. The essential amino acids are found in lean meats, nuts,
grains, soy, fish, eggs, and dairy products. 
Two sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, are
most important for maintaining hair health because human hair
requires sulfur for normal growth. (The body also requires sulfur
for healthy connective tissue formation.)
 Methionine: Methionine is an essential amino acid that your
body doesn’t produce, so it must come from your diet or from
supplements. Foods rich in methionine include sesame seeds,
fish, meats, and some other plant seeds.
The current recommended dose of methionine is 250 mil-
ligrams per day. Taking too much of this amino acid can cause
toxicity because methionine is broken down into homocys-
teine, which can lead to heart disease.
 Cysteine: Cysteine supports hair growth by providing sulfur
to replicating hair follicle cells. It’s a non-essential amino acid,
which means that your body can make it on its own. Cysteine
also is found in most high-protein foods, including eggs, milk,
whey protein, some cheese, chicken, turkey, and duck.
Vegetarian sources include red peppers, garlic, brussel
sprouts, oats, and wheat.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
164

The recommended dose of cysteine is 100 milligrams per day.
Supplementing your diet with cysteine has the affect of
increasing the sulfur percentage in hair, which has been
reported to increase the thickness and the strength of the hair. 
Fitting in the good fats
“Good fats,” or essential fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6
oils, are essential for your body’s functioning but are only obtained
through your diet — your body can’t manufacture these. You can
get these essential fatty acids from fish (salmon, sardines, tuna),
plant (flaxseed, soybeans, pumpkin seeds), and nut (walnut) oils,
as well as in fish oil capsules.
After two to four months of essential fatty acid deficiency, people
report hair dryness, change of hair color, scalp redness, and flakes.
Consuming unsaturated fatty acids, for example fish oil or evening
primrose oil, has been found to improve hair texture and scalp red-
ness after a few months.
On the other hand, some people believe that a diet too heavy in
saturated animal fat may contribute to hair loss. Evidence comes
from the effects of dietary change seen in Japanese men. After
World War II, more Japanese men started consuming greater
amounts of saturated animal fats, and they also started complain-
ing of hair loss. Although this interesting relationship doesn’t
prove cause and effect, it does show one possible effect of diet on
your hair.
In traditional Indian medicine, body weakness is believed to cause
hair loss, and so one treatment consists of a diet rich in proteins,
including meat, fish (source of essential fatty acids), and dairy
products. Avoidance of fried foods (source of saturated fats) is
also recommended.
Getting your daily vitamins
Vitamins are organic compounds necessary to sustain life. You
need to get your vitamins from food or dietary supplements,
because you can’t make them yourself. Most vitamins work to
speed up critical chemical reactions in the body.
Vitamins are important nutrients for healthy hair. Don’t start taking
vitamins by the handful to make sure you’re getting your daily
requirement, though; doctors have linked hair loss to both defi-
ciencies of some vitamins and excesses of others, and some vita-
mins can be dangerous to your overall health if you take too many.
Chapter 10: Supplementing Your Diet to Help Slow Hair Loss 165

The following sections run through the vitamins you need and the
quantities that are helpful for your hair — and the rest of you!
Vitamin A
Vitamin A protects hair follicles from damage by free radicals,
which are atoms with an unpaired electron. A diet deficient in vita-
min A is also known to cause dry hair.
Too much vitamin A has been linked to hair loss. Vitamin A is a fat-
soluble vitamin, which means that excess amounts are stored in
the body and not washed out in urine, so it’s essential to keep vita-
min A intake within normal limits.
Foods high in vitamin A include carrots, broccoli, and liver. The
current recommendation of daily vitamin A intake is 900 micro-
grams (mcg) (3,000 IU) for men and 700 micrograms (2,300 IU) for
women.
B-complex vitamins
The B vitamins include thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine,
cobalmin, and pantothenic acid. B vitamins are believed to con-
tribute to the nourishment of the hair follicle.
You can get B vitamins from foods such as potatoes, bananas, tuna,
and turkey. Deficiency in B vitamins has been associated with
anemia and neurologic problems. 
 Biotin: Also known as vitamin H or B7, biotin is a water-
soluble B-complex vitamin that’s required for cell growth,
the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of amino
acids. An adequate amount of biotin is about 30 to 100 mcg
daily. Biotin is found in many foods including beans, bread,
fish, and legumes.
Biotin deficiency has been strongly linked to hair loss and,
when severe, can even lead to loss of the eyebrows and
lashes. Deficiency is rare but can be caused by excessive con-
sumption of raw eggs, which contain high levels of the protein
avidin, which strongly binds biotin.
 Folic acid: This is the synthesized form of folate, which is
important to maintain hair follicle cell division and growth.
Rich sources of folate include leafy vegetables such as
spinach, lettuce, dried beans, and other fruits and vegetables.
The current recommendation for folate intake is 400 mcg per
day. However, if you’re pregnant or nursing, you should ask
your doctor for a recommended dosage.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
166

Signs of folic acid deficiency include anemia, increased fatigue,
sore tongue, and graying hair. There’s evidence that exposure to
ultraviolet light, including the use of tanning beds, can lead to a
folic acid deficiency. In addition certain medicines, such as
methotrexate used to treat severe psoriasis and some forms of
cancer, can lead to deficiency.
Vitamin C
Vitamin C is required to maintain healthy collagen in the connec-
tive tissue in your body and also around hair follicles. It also pro-
tects your cells because it’s a strong antioxidant (a substance that
reduces damage caused by free radicals, which contribute to aging
changes and can cause problems in many body systems).
Citrus fruit is a rich source of vitamin C. Currently, the recom-
mended dose of vitamin C is 90 milligrams per day and no more
than 2 grams per day.
The most famous condition associated with vitamin C deficiency is
scurvy, which results when collagen stops functioning properly.
Symptoms of scurvy include bleeding gums, nose bleeds, sunken
eyes, dark purplish spots on the legs, pinpoint bleeding around
hair follicles, as well as unique “corkscrew hairs.” Fortunately, this
disease is rare in industrialized countries where fruits and vegeta-
bles are plentiful in the diet. 
Vitamin E
Vitamin E is the collective name for a set of eight related fat-soluble
vitamins with antioxidant properties. Vitamin E provides physical
stability to cell membranes, including cell membranes of hair folli-
cles. Nuts, corn, and asparagus are just a few foods with high vita-
min E levels. The daily recommendation of vitamin E for adults is 8
to 10 mg.
Vitamin E deficiency is rare and usually manifests first with neuro-
logic deterioration, such as loss of reflexes.
A recent study from Johns Hopkins University showed that taking
vitamin E supplements in amounts greater than 400 IU a day may
actually be harmful to your health, increasing your risk of death
from a number of causes.
IU is dependent on the potency of the substance, and each sub-
stance would have a different IU to milligram conversion. For
example, 1,000 IU of Vitamin C would have a different weight than
1,000 IU of Vitamin A. Because each substance would have a differ-
ent conversion ratio, we cannot state a conversion for IU to mil-
ligrams that covers everything, or even most things. There are just
too many different substances.

Minding your mineral intake
Minerals are inorganic elements that are essential to the function-
ing of the human body and are obtained from foods. Minerals nec-
essary to maintain hair health include copper, iodine, iron,
selenium, silica, and zinc. Table 10-1 lays them all out for you.

The Helsinki Formula failure
In the 1980s, niacin was combined with polysorbate 80 and vitamin B6 and marketed
under the name Helsinki Formula. Heavy promotion led to the first large market for
a hair loss product. The concoction proved to be ineffective, though, and the Helsinki
Formula lost its $100 million market. But its marketing efforts opened eyes to a mar-
keting field ripe with people willing to try anything to keep or replace their hair, which
has spurred the development of hundreds of hair loss products and a billion-dollar
business in the 21st century.

Oils, Herbs, and Extracts:
Alternative Hair Loss Remedies
Concern over hair loss has plagued men and women for thousands
of years, and hair loss remedies go back almost as far. The ancient
Egyptians applied concoctions directly to the scalp or consumed
them to try to combat the balding process. The famous Greek
physician Hippocrates is rumored to have applied pigeon drop-
pings to his scalp in hopes to regrow hair. And in colonial times,
America’s balding forefathers donned white wigs to cover shiny
scalps. There has been no lack of creative cover-ups or attempts to
save rapidly receding hairlines over the years.
Here, we review some alternative, but not scientifically proven,
methods of keeping hair where it belongs, including ancient
Chinese and Indian oils and herbs.
Oiling it up
Oiling your hair may seem a little out of date, but over the years,
many people have used oils to stimulate hair growth. For example,
the ancient Egyptians were very concerned about maintaining
thick hair and believed that castor oil applied to the scalp could
stimulate hair growth. (They sometimes mixed it with sweet
almond oil to improve the smell.) Ancient Indians and Polynesians
used coconut oil, and ancient Africans used olive oil, all applied to
the hair and scalp in an attempt to stimulate hair growth.
At least one current study shows that oil application can help with
some specific types of hair loss. In 1998, researchers from Scotland
published their results of a randomized, double-blind controlled
study investigating aromatherapy in patients with alopecia areata,
a condition in which the body’s immune cells start attacking
healthy hair-producing cells. (We cover it in Chapter 5.)
In this study, 86 patients were placed into two different groups.
One (the active group) massaged their scalps daily with four essen-
tial oils (thyme, rosemary, lavender, and cedar wood) in a mixture
of jojoba and grape seed oils. The other group (the control group)
massaged only jojoba and grape seed oils into their scalps daily.
Each group massaged the oils into their scalps for a total of seven
months. 
Interestingly, 19 of 43 patients (44 percent) in the active group
showed improvement compared with only 6 of 41 patients (15 
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
170

percent) in the control group. The authors concluded that aro-
matherapy with these essential oils may be a safe and effective
treatment for alopecia areata.
Helping hair with herbs
In recent years, growing concern about potential short- and long-
term side effects of pharmaceuticals and conventional medical
treatments have led to an increase in popularity of alternative med-
icines and herbal therapies. This trend affects all aspects of medi-
cine, including increased interest in seeking herbal remedies for
hair loss.
It’s important to remember that “natural” doesn’t always mean
“harmless.” Also, there’s no way to be sure exactly how much
herbal remedy is in a purchased product. Herbal products suppos-
edly containing the same amount of medication have been found to
vary considerably under testing.
Herbals aren’t like FDA-approved medicines, and few herbal reme-
dies have been studied in a controlled fashion for hair loss. Many
are advertised as miracle treatments with little evidence to sup-
port the claims that they’re either safe or effective. This doesn’t
mean that they don’t work to regrow hair, just that there’s not
enough scientific evidence to support that claim.
The bottom line is this: Before you decide to ingest or topically
apply something to any part of your body, including your head,
don’t assume that product is safe just because it’s labeled “natu-
ral.” The following sections get into a number of alternative medi-
cines. Our goal in sharing this information isn’t to advocate the
use, or disuse, of these products but merely to present them in as
scientific a manner as possible.
Saw palmetto
Saw palmetto is a small plum plant endemic to the southeastern
United States. It’s believed that the medicinal properties of the
plant come from its brown-black berries.
Native Americans used saw palmetto to relieve urinary symptoms
in older men who had difficulty urinating. Over the years, several
studies have documented the effectiveness of saw palmetto in the
treatment of benign prostate gland enlargement (BPH), and it’s
used quite frequently in Europe.
Saw palmetto has also gained popularity as an herbal remedy for
androgenic alopecia, or male pattern baldness, although there’s far
less scientific evidence that it works to prevent hair loss.
Chapter 10: Supplementing Your Diet to Help Slow Hair Loss 171

Although the exact mechanism isn’t fully understood, several basic
research studies have demonstrated that saw palmetto blocks the
enzyme 5-alpha-reductase, which functions to convert testosterone
to DHT, the male hormone responsible for male pattern baldness
(see Chapter 4 for more about DHT).
Only one study examining saw palmetto to treat male pattern bald-
ness has been published in the medical literature. In this small
study, six out of ten subjects with androgenic alopecia who
received saw palmetto benefited from the treatment. This is far too
small a study to draw any conclusions on whether saw palmetto
actually works to treat pattern hair loss.
Saw palmetto has several potential side effects. The most common
are mild and include abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomit-
ing, and constipation. Men taking saw palmetto have also reported
erectile dysfunction, breast tenderness or enlargement, and loss 
of libido.
If you’re taking hormone medications for hair loss, such as
Propecia, you shouldn’t take saw palmetto because combining
these two may increase the way your body reacts to them. You
also shouldn’t take saw palmetto without medical supervision if
you’re on blood thinners, and the use of saw palmetto by pregnant
or nursing women should be avoided as there has been no safety
testing in this population.
Traditional Chinese medicine
Pattern baldness is relatively less common among the Asian popu-
lation than among Caucasians; many believe this may be related to
diet, although the Asian hair type and heredity may also play a
part. Asians have a diet rich in vegetables and herbs, some of
which may help fight hair loss. 
Researchers have found that a series of amino acids found in
legumes and vegetables inhibit the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase 
Type II, which converts testosterone to DHT, the male hormone
responsible for male pattern baldness (see Chapter 4). Excess
amounts of zinc taken in supplements can have the same effect. 
If these reports are accurate and reproducible, then the use of 
certain amino acids and zinc may slow down hair loss, much like
the use of certain drugs such as finasteride and dutasteride.
Roasted sesame seeds are an herbal food used for hundreds of
years in Chinese medicine. They’re believed to decrease hair loss
and possibly stimulate hair regrowth.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
172

The following sections take a close look at two Chinese herbal
remedies with long histories. 
He Shou Wu
Many believe that the Chinese herb He Shou Wu, also known as
Polygoni multiflori or Fo Ti, stimulates hair growth and also con-
verts fine vellus hair to thicker terminal hair. It may also delay nat-
ural graying. Practitioners of Chinese medicine use He Shou Wu for
other conditions, such as strengthening weak bones, decreasing
high blood pressure, and treating constipation. It’s also thought to
have anti-aging properties.
To obtain a benefit from He Shou Wu, you have to ingest the root
powder for several months. Known side effects include headaches
and diarrhea.
Recently, the Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA) in London released a warning about potential liver
damage from the use of He Shou Wu. The MHRA advises that
anyone with elevated liver enzymes or liver disease avoid this
product until they discuss it with their doctor.
In 2002, a controlled clinical trial was conducted using a combina-
tion of oral tablets and lotion containing He Shou Wu. While the
final groups were of very small sample size, results did favor the
group who received the active herbal ingredients. However, you
can’t draw any definitive conclusions from such a small study, and
further research is needed to confirm the results.
Dabao
In 1991, researchers from the Netherlands studied the effective-
ness of the Chinese herb extract Dabao for the treatment of male
pattern baldness. In this study, 373 people with androgenic alope-
cia completed the full six-month trial. At the end of the study, the
authors concluded that over a six-month period, Dabao has a
(albeit modest) cosmetic effect superior to placebo.
Ayurvedic remedies
Ayurvedic medicine is an alternative medical practice based on the
traditional medicine of India. The word Ayurveda is derived from a
combination of two Sanskrit terms: ayu meaning “life,” and veda
meaning “knowledge” or “science.” The practice of Ayurvedic med-
icine is believed to be over 5,000 years old in India, and it uses a
number of herbs to help prevent hair loss, including
Chapter 10: Supplementing Your Diet to Help Slow Hair Loss 173

 Bhringaraj (Eclipta alba), which is believed to promote new
hair growth and also bring back natural hair color in people
who are graying.
 Gotu kola (Centella asiatica), very commonly used to treat
hair loss as well as to stimulate brain cells, being believed to
help with memory and longevity.
 Tridax procumbens, amalaki, sandalwood (Santalum), and
licorice (Hlycyrrhiza glabra), all of which may stimulate hair
growth.
In 2007 researchers in India tested the combination of extracts
from three traditional Indian herbs to see what affects they would
have on hair growth in rats. The topical formulation sped up hair
growth on shaved rats, and analysis of the hair growth cycle after
treatment revealed more hair follicles in the anagen phase, when
hair cells grow rapidly, compared with controls.
Additional herbal remedies
 Herbal tea: To treat hair loss, brew an herbal tea with a com-
bination of nettle tea, sage, and rosemary. No time for a cup of
tea? Apply the mixture directly to your scalp! (No, we’re not
kidding.) No matter how you use it, herbal tea is thought to
cause hair growth by improving blood flow to the scalp.
 Procyanidin B-2: This extract from apples has been shown to
promote hair growth in a laboratory study. Perhaps the old
adage “An apple a day keeps the doctor away” may soon
change to “An apple a day keeps the hair loss away!” 
 Procyanidolic oligomers (PCOs): Extracts from the French
maritime pine bark and grape seeds belong to this family of
antioxidant substances. One POC may have the effects of stim-
ulating hair growth, but more studies are needed to confirm
this.
 Horsetail extract: This herb is a natural source of cysteine,
selenium, and silica, which we discuss in the sections
“Pumping up calories and proteins” and Table 10-1, earlier in
this chapter. 
Potions, Mixtures, and Other
Dubious Products
We try to protect our patients from the unknown. When we don’t
know something to be proven, we remind ourselves of how many
undocumented side effects or enzyme defects occur that are
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
174

caused by natural herbs that could threaten a person’s health or
life because they’re not researched or understood. For example,
arsenic is a natural substance used historically to treat syphilis,
but we wouldn’t recommend arsenic as an alternative to modern
antibiotics, which are safe, well tested, FDA regulated, and
accepted worldwide.
The supplements and substances listed in this section may not be
covered in the FDA regulatory process that confirms dosages,
purity, safety, and efficacy. The research and studies that show effi-
cacy are often funded by the supplement manufacturers, which
obviously may bias the reported results. Finally, the proper
dosages for such products seem arbitrary and unproven. Just
because the friendly neighborhood natural food outlet sales staff
are dressed in white lab coats and attest to the efficacy of a home-
opathic product doesn’t mean that these are safe and/or effective.
This exhausting — but not exhaustive — list of herbals, minerals,
vegetables, and combinations of these substances may be pack-
aged into products that make claims for hair regrowth:
 Advecia: Herbal reported to be a hair loss vitamin.
 Aloe vera: Plant extract with many uses reported in topical
use. The leaf of the plant exudes a white, sticky substance
that has been claimed to be a strong topical agent used for
medicinal purposes.
 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): Although suggested for
hair growth, there are many reports that this hormone actu-
ally causes hair loss, possibly working in a way similar to
steroids.
 Evening promise oil: Capsules contain gamma-linolenic acid,
which is claimed to convert into hormone-like compounds
that help regulate a number of bodily functions.
 Fava beans: Fava is an herb widely used in Polynesia to treat
anxiety. Though harmless, fava beans can cause death in very
small quantities in people who carry a rare genetic defect. 
 L-Arginine: Homeopathic remedy thought to increase circula-
tion to the scalp.
 Lingzhi: Flat polypore mushroom used to treat hair loss, obe-
sity, and liver disease in traditional Chinese medicine.
 Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM): White, crystalline powder
that’s odorless and nearly tasteless. It’s reported to be a 
sulphur-rich hair tonic in its cream form, but it’s also known
to be quite smelly!
Chapter 10: Supplementing Your Diet to Help Slow Hair Loss 175

 Nettle sting root: Reported effect on dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) levels has also made it a treatment for hair loss.
 Olive oil: Claims abound that it can grow hair, particularly
when mixed with coconut oil and/or mayonnaise, heated, and
rubbed into the scalp.
 Soy extract: May arrest hair loss.
 Tribulus terrestri and Ava Renewale: Reported natural
Chinese herbs that seem to do everything and anything;
they’re proposed as a cure for many conditions, including 
hair loss.
 Wheatgrass: Young version of the common wheat plant that
can be a source of vitamins A, B, C, and E; as well as calcium,
magnesium, potassium, iron, natural enzymes, and 
chlorophyll.
The following items are manufactured products that may include
the ingredients in the previous list:
 Ervamatin: Hair lotion composed of herbs and plants from
the Amazon rain forest.
 Eucapil: Approved as a cosmetic hair care agent for topical
use in the Czech and Slovak Republics.
 Hairgenesis: Botanical that has claims of blocking DHT, a
labeling violation under FDA labeling rules.
 Himalaya Hair Loss Cream: An Ayurvedic preparation (refer
to the earlier section “Ayurvedic remedies”).
 Nutrifolica: Manufacturer claims this 100 percent pure herbal
extract is designed to counteract hair loss causes such as
poor scalp circulation, clogged hair follicles, and excessive
sebaceous oil.
 NutriSol-RM, or Scalp Med: Proprietary formulation packaged
with essential amino acids and other agents. It claims to
ensure optimal delivery of growth agents and nutrients to the
matrix cells in the bulb of hair to revitalize the follicle, helping
to grow hair.
 Procerin: Invalid claim to be a vitamin for hair loss that’s spe-
cially formulated to block production of DHT, the primary
cause of hair loss in men.
 Provillis: Nutritional supplement claimed to contain all-natural
herbal ingredients that aren’t specified.
 Shen Min: Chinese medicinal line of natural dietary supple-
ments designed to help reduce hair loss and enhance hair

growth in men and women. It’s a combination of “standard-
ized” herbs such as He Shou Wu and horse chestnut extract
with nutrients such as silica and biotin.
 T Bomb 2: Product that claims to block estrogen and enhance
testosterone and contains many and varied ingredients,
making it potentially dangerous.

Low-Level Laser Therapy
In This Chapter
 Looking to lasers to replace lost hair
 Deciding whether to see a doctor or do it yourself
 Assessing the risks and benefits
W
hen people hear the words “laser” and “hair” in the same
sentence, they usually think of hair removal. Although
lasers work for hair removal, they may possibly also stimulate 
hair growth if used properly, although there haven’t been enough
scientific studies to prove this beyond any doubt.
In this chapter, we look at the role of lasers in hair replacement,
the pros and cons of using lasers, and the results you can reason-
ably expect from laser treatment, as well as potential problems
associated with lasers and the question of whether they really
work for most people.
Discovering Lasers
The term laser is an acronym that stands for “light amplification by
the stimulated emission of radiation.” Credit for the initial theory
behind lasers goes to Albert Einstein, but many other scientists
took his lead and further advanced this technology.
Lasers sound high tech and complicated, and they are, but they’re
easier to understand than you may think. In the next sections, 
we discuss how lasers were invented, what they can do, and the
differences in high-power and low-power laser therapy.
How laser therapy works
You’ve all seen lasers used in movies to defeat the evil empire, 
but lasers are no longer just part of science fiction. Lasers, which
are thin, intensely focused light beams which emit a very pure 

light of one wavelength, have many medical applications today,
and are being touted as a possible stimulus for hair growth in 
balding areas.
Most lasers used for cosmetic purposes target specific chro-
mophores (components in the skin that absorb light) in the body.
The major chromophores that affect your hair are
 Melanin (in hair follicles and sun spots)
 Hemoglobin (in blood vessels)
 Water (throughout the epidermis and dermis — layers of 
your skin)
Medical lasers can be either high or low powered. There’s no 
question that high powered lasers are very effective in treating a
number of medical conditions. 
High-powered lasers are used to destroy hair follicles and remove
unwanted hair, target abnormal blood vessels (such as varicose
veins), and erase fine lines and wrinkles. High powered lasers can
cut through tissue, burn tissue, and emit heat. 
Low-level lasers, on the other hand, don’t produce heat, and are
generally used to heal damaged tissue rather than to destroy
tissue.
Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) may stimulate better hair growth in
an area that still has hair; it’s not effective in growing new hair in a
completely bald area.
Low-level laser therapy
Low-level laser therapy is a non-invasive technology that has 
been around for many years. Its main uses have been to stimulate
wound healing, decrease inflammation, and lessen intense 
chronic pain. 
The first low-level therapeutic laser was developed in the 1960s by
Hungary’s Endre Mester. He reported an improved healing of
wounds through low-level laser treatment.
When used for hair loss, the theory is that chromophores absorb
the laser light, which then stimulates hair growth in balding areas,
possibly by increasing blood flow and increased oxygen flow to the
area, which may stimulate the hair follicle at the cellular level and
cause weak or thin hair to become stronger and thicker. We say
“possibly” because this theory has yet to be scientifically proven. 
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
180

Some clinicians believe these effects are due to a photochemical
reaction produced by the interaction of the laser light with the 
hair follicle. This reaction alters the cell’s internal processing and
signals it to start growing rather than slowly dying. 
Hairs that have already begun to miniaturize (thin in diameter)
apparently respond to treatment, though completely bald areas
typically do not respond. It takes typically up to 12 months to see
any new hair growth, if it happens at all.
Who benefits from LLLT?
Both men and women experiencing androgenic alopecia, or genetic
induced pattern baldness, appear to be the best candidates for
LLLT. Some evidence suggests that LLLT works better when used in
conjunction with minoxidil (topical over the counter medication
for hair growth) and/or finasteride (prescription pill). (See Chapter
9 for more on both medications.)
Because LLLT isn’t particularly effective on bald areas, it may be 
a more effective treatment in women, whose hair loss is typically
diffuse (spread throughout the scalp) and more miniaturized, 
than in men, who typically have more areas of the scalp that are
totally bald.
Note that laser therapy does not lead to permanent results. You
must continue therapy in order for the hair to keep growing.
Looking at the clinical data
The clinical data for LLLT relating to hair loss isn’t as plentiful as it
is for proven treatments such as minoxidil and finasteride (see
Chapter 9 for more on these medications). Although numerous
reports and studies document its effectiveness, none of these 
studies were conducted in a controlled manner over a long period
of time (greater than six months). Many reports of success with
LLLT are anecdotal from individuals.
This lack of evidence does not mean that it doesn’t work, but it
does underscore the need for in-depth, long-term studies on the
effectiveness of LLLT.
In 2003, a peer-reviewed medical journal published the first study
looking at the effectiveness of a handheld LLLT device for the treat-
ment of hair loss. Thirty-five patients diagnosed with androgenic
alopecia participated in this study (28 male, 7 female); each got the
handheld device for use at home for five to ten minutes every
other day for six months.
Chapter 11: Low-Level Laser Therapy 181

After six months of use, hair counts in the temples increased by an
average of 55 percent in females and 74 percent in males. In the
vertex (crown of the scalp), the increase was 65 percent for females
and 120 percent for men. 
In total, for both areas, hair count increased by an average of 94
percent. In addition, the study reported an increase in hair
strength.
Although these numbers sound very positive, put them in perspec-
tive. For example, one male patient had a total of 12 hairs in the
counted area at baseline and then 23 hairs six months later. This
change corresponded to an increase in hairs of 92 percent. In 
reality, though, 11 extra hairs probably didn’t make a huge differ-
ence in his physical appearance, and the data was highly suspect
when analyzed by these authors.
Finding a Physician
We recommend that you contact a physician who has experience
in diagnosing the cause of hair loss before beginning LLLT therapy
either in the doctor’s office or at home, because other equally or
more-effective treatments may be available to you; you may also be
able to use these other treatments in conjunction with LLLT to
enhance your results. 
Combined therapy makes sense, as you may get complementary
benefits from the different approaches, and one type of therapy
may enhance the other.
Dermatologists are specifically trained in the diagnosis and 
treatment of hair loss, so consider starting with them. Check out
www.aad.org for a list of dermatologists. Head to www.ishrs.org
to find doctors who specialize in the surgical treatment of hair 
loss and who also have knowledge of LLLT treatments. 
LLLT systems available in the doctor’s office involve the patient 
sitting under the machine, an experience similar to sitting under a
hair dryer at the hair salon. The advantages of having laser done 
in the office include the following:
 The lasers are stronger.
 You get a precise amount of laser delivered each time.
 It’s less stressful than trying to do it yourself.
 Results are better-monitored over time by a doctor.
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies

The disadvantages of the office-based system are
 You have to leave home to have it done.
 You have to make multiple trips to the office.
 It’s much more expensive than doing it yourself.
Treatments are generally administered two or three times per week
for 6 weeks and then once a week for the next 16 weeks. After
observable hair growth occurs, periodic touch-ups may be needed
to maintain the benefits of the treatment. Each treatment session
takes approximately 20 minutes.
The doctor’s office based systems generally price the service for a
three or six month course of therapy with up to three visits per
week at a cost of a few thousand dollars. 
As of this writing, the in-office systems have been issued an acces-
sion number by the FDA, meaning the products are classified as
cosmetic products and have met the international laser standards
for safety. However, they’re not yet FDA cleared for hair growth
because scientific proof is lacking.
Manufacturers of the devices claim that studies with this type of
machine have shown an 85 percent success rate in halting the 
progression of hair loss and up to a 39 percent increase in fullness,
but again, scientific studies are lacking to confirm this.
Office-based treatments come in two varieties: a system with fixed
diodes and a system with moving diodes.
In the fixed or static system, approximately 100 diodes (an electri-
cal device which has two wires leading into them to produce a flow
of electricity, in one side and out the other), each emitting light at
a wavelength of about 650mn, are set into an apparatus that sits
over the person’s head.
The moving-diode system utilizes Rotational Phototherapy (RPT),
in which 30 laser diodes rotate 180 degrees around the scalp. This
process supposedly increases the contact of the laser energy with
the hair follicles around the entire scalp and is potentially more
effective in stimulating hair growth than other types of lasers. 
The “shade covering” caused by your hair may block the laser
from reaching the scalp, but in the moving diode systems, a new
position assures more laser penetration through the hair and into
the scalp.

Doing It Yourself: Hand-held
Home-use Lasers
You may be interested in trying out an LLLT device, but aren’t 
willing to put out the time and effort, not to mention the cash, to
do LLT in a doctor’s office. 
There are now handheld home use lasers that might work for you if
this is a therapy you’d like to try but don’t feel like making a heavy
time commitment.
Don’t count on saving much cash, though; home use handheld
LLLTs cost around $300–$500, not a small chunk of change but less
than the several thousand you’d spend for in office treatment. 
The advantages of the hand-held system are:
 It’s much cheaper and more convenient than driving to the
doctor’s office.
 The handheld system, which can part your hair to reach your
scalp, may allow the laser to better reach your scalp if you
still have quite a bit of hair.
The major disadvantages of the handheld device are
 You may get tired of doing treatments several times a week, or
forget to do it.
 You may have a hard time judging whether the treatments are
working or when to stop them.
Some handheld products emit low level laser when held over your
head; theoretically using a comb may deliver the therapy more
directly to the scalp. Another handheld system delivers the laser
light through multiple clear plastic tips on the end of the instru-
ment that are in direct contact with the scalp. 
With this system, 15 separate points of laser light irradiate the
scalp. In addition, the floating laser heads of this instrument
ensure that the laser light channels conform to the shape of 
the scalp and head. This direct contact is the main differentiating
feature between this machine and the laser comb.
Two of the more popular handheld laser combs are the HairMax
LaserComb, which was FDA-cleared (see chapter 18 for informa-
tion on the difference between FDA clearance and FDA approval) to
promote hair growth in men with certain types of male pattern
Part IV: Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
184

balding, and the X-5 hair laser, which conforms to the scalp arch
and delivers energy directly at the scalp level after the hair is 
separated by the prongs.
Although the manufacturers recommend use of the handheld home
devices three times a week, it’s not clear what frequency of use is
effective, since no evidence has been presented to show the value
of either the frequency or the duration of the laser application. 
Most of the home use lasers emit a beep to let you know when it’s
time to move the device to another part of your hair, so you don’t
laser one area for too long.
In the one reported study of the handheld LaserComb, 93 percent
of the participants (ages 30 to 60) had an increase in the number of
terminal (thick) hairs. In the treatment group, the average number
of terminal hairs per square centimeter increased by 19 hairs per
square centimeter over a six-month period.
For the same period, the number of hairs in the control (placebo)
group decreased by an average of 10.6 hairs per square centimeter,
so the relative increase with the laser comb was actually 29.4 hairs
per square centimeter.
The base hair counts in both groups were 125 hairs per square
centimeter. (As a reference, the average non-balding person has
approximately 220 hairs per square centimeter.) During the study,
patients reported no serious adverse reactions.
Understanding the Potential 
Risks of LLLT
We consider handheld lasers to be safe devices that can be used
for hair application. There appear to be no safety issues concern-
ing their use and, although the current scientific studies are lack-
ing, they may be beneficial for some people. 
One caveat, however, may be that the long term use of LLLT
devices for hair loss hasn’t been adequately studied, and that long
term side effects could show up in the future.
Because some LLLT devices for hair loss have been cleared by 
the FDA, many people feel that they must be safe and effective.
However, FDA clearance and FDA approval are different things (see
chapter 18 for more discussion on the FDA’s involvement with hair
care products). 
Chapter 11: Low-Level Laser Therapy 185

Obtaining FDA approval is a far more stringent process, with 
clinical trials required to prove that the drug or device is both safe
and effective.
Part IV : Pharmaceutical, Laser, and Topical Therapies 
186
Backing up medical claims
Devices intended for cosmetic use don’t generally require FDA clearance or
approval. However, one device, called the LaserComb did require FDA clearance
because it made a medical claim, that it would promote hair growth in males with
certain types of balding. 
To obtain FDA clearance, the company had to submit both safety and effectiveness
data. The effectiveness data was obtained from a multicenter, randomized, placebo-
controlled trial conducted at four sites in the U.S. FDA approval requires a much
more rigorous process. 
In this study, participants used the laser comb or a “sham” (placebo type) device
three times a week for six months. In fact, a major limitation of this study is that the
treatment period was only six months with relatively infrequent use, so that the long-
term results and safety issues are unknown. 
Another problem was that the studies don’t appear to have been double blinded (in
a double blinded study, the doctors and patients involved don’t know who’s getting
the sham treatment and who’s getting the laser treatment) and it’s not clear whether
the participants may have agreed not to use other treatment modalities, so there’s
the additional problem of potential biases in the measurement of mean terminal hair
density; in other words, the doctor’s doing the assessing may have found more hair
in the patients who got the actual treatment because they expected to.

Taking the Long Road to Modern
Hair Transplantation
Searching for a cure for hair loss is nothing new, but it’s only in
recent years that greater knowledge of genetics and the chemistry
of the sex hormones has helped doctors begin to really understand
the causes. Androgenic alopecia, also known as male pattern bald-
ness, affects more than half the male population to some degree,
and it remains the most common cause of balding. Because it also
responds well to hair transplantation, hair restoration surgery 
has gained popularity as a permanent means of addressing genetic
hair loss.

Looking at early attempts for a cure
The first documented hair transplant was done in 1822 by J.
Dieffenbach in Wurzburg, Germany. He investigated the concept 
of auto transplantation (transplanting from one part of the body 
to another) using hair, feathers, and skin in animals. 
Although there were sporadic reports of hair transplantation in
European and Japanese literature during the mid to late 19th 
century, the modern era of hair transplantation really began in
1939 with the Japanese dermatologist, Dr. Okuda, who used 
small grafts to correct various hair loss conditions of the scalp,
eyebrows, and mustache.
Dr. Okuda transplanted round grafts of skin containing multiple
hair follicles from permanent hair-bearing areas into smaller,
scarred recipient sites. He noticed better cosmetic results with
slightly smaller punches than larger ones in the recipient area.
Here’s a brief timeline of key steps toward modern hair loss 
treatments:
 In 1943, Dr. Tamura treated 137 patients with non-androgenic
alopecia of various causes to restore female pubic hair. He
noted that single hair grafts produced results almost indistin-
guishable from the natural growing hairs. He also noted that
larger grafts produced a very unnatural appearance. Due to
World War II, the Japanese doctor’s findings remained
unknown to the Western world.
 In 1952, Dr. Orentreich performed the first hair transplant 
for male pattern baldness. Seven years later, he coined the
term “donor dominance,” which is the basic principle of hair
transplantation that hair grafts from the back and side of 
the head (donor sites) continue to grow hair when they’re
transplanted to a bald (recipient) site.
 In 1975, a dermatologist and hair transplant surgeon, Dr. O’Tar
Norwood, building upon earlier work, developed a classifica-
tion of male pattern hair loss that’s still widely used today.
(You can find more about the Norwood classification system
in Chapter 4.)
Tracing the evolution of hair 
restoration techniques
Hair transplantation began in the United States in the late 1950s.
When doctors examined bald men, they could see that there was
hair on their heads but it was just located in the wrong places. So
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
190

doctors became very creative in finding ways to redistribute the
hair. In this new field, they used tools adapted from other proce-
dures that dermatologists and surgeons commonly performed at
the time.
This section explains the three procedures targeted the removal 
of part of the bald portion of the scalp and rearranging the 
existing hair.
Punching out plugs
One of the most popular instruments used in early hair transplants
was a circular biopsy punch measuring between 3-4 mm. Readily
available, it became the standard way to remove donor tissue 
from the back of the scalp for the transplant. This hair-bearing
tissue was referred to as a plug and soon gained both positive
(physiologic) and negative (aesthetic) connotations.
Because these plugs were large, skin had to be removed from the
front of the scalp (the recipient area) to make room for them. In
fact, the same size punch used to remove tissue from the back of
the scalp was also used to remove bald skin from the front. It was
replaced with hair-bearing circles of skin from the back and sides
of the head where the hair was permanent. 
This punch graft technique was the standard procedure for all hair
transplants for many years. It was responsible for the extremely
noticeable “pluggy doll” look that people commonly associate with
the older hair transplant procedures.
Flapping it over
Rather than punching out pieces of scalp and moving them around,
an Argentine plastic surgeon, Dr. Jose Juri, had the idea of directly
rearranging the scalp by moving one part of it to another.
He would partly incise a banana-size piece of hair-bearing scalp,
keeping one part of it connected to its blood supply. Within a 
few weeks, the healed flap of skin could be lifted up and moved,
provided that the blood supply was maintained on one edge.
The flap was rotated so that the hair-bearing skin covered an area
of bald scalp that was removed to make room for the flap (see
Figure 12-1). 
The defect in the scalp at the donor area was repaired by stretch-
ing the hairy sides of the scalp almost to the ears and pulling the
two sides together to close the defect, and if the defect could not
be closed, the wound would be left open to close on its own.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 191

Figure 12-1: A hair flap procedure moved a piece of scalp from one place 
to another.
This procedure had the following advantages:
 The results were instantaneous. Other than the time between
the first surgery to create the flap and the second one to 
relocate it, there was no waiting around for hair growth.
 A hairline with thick hair was created when the flap was
secured in its new location.
These advantages may make the procedure sound appealing, if
perhaps a bit macabre (moving pieces of scalp around your
head?). Unsurprisingly, there were many problems with flaps,
including the following:
 Unless the surgeon was very experienced, the blood supply to
the flap could fail, leaving the patient with part or all of the
flap dying in its new location in the recipient area.
 The wounds at the recipient site were often a problem, creat-
ing a bald area where there was formerly hair. The new bald
area often scarred heavily, sometimes with the appearance of
an elevated keloid-type scar or just a scar along the edge of
the flap.
 The hair didn’t grow forward, as natural hair in the bald area
would have grown. It often grew to the side, or even backward
because it maintained its original hair direction in the flap.
 There was a distinct change from the hairless forehead to 
a heavy line of thick hair and then, if the patient had any
degree of baldness behind the flap the ‘island’ of flap would
be easily seen.

 Unlike a natural hairline, which has a slow transition from the
bald forehead to the thicker hair area behind it, the flap had 
a detectably abrupt hairline and then an abnormal transition
to baldness on the back side of the scalp.
 One flap couldn’t cover the entire reconstructed frontal hair-
line, so two flaps were often used and joined in the middle or
off to one side. This produced two open wounds in the area it
was taken from (one on each side), two directions for frontal
hair growth, and a small (or large) cleft between the flaps.
 Multiple flaps often weren’t equally positioned, so it wasn’t
unusual for the hairline to be off balance, with a shape 
determined by the surgeon’s need to cover the scalp rather
than aesthetics. As a result, the new hairline of many of these
patients just didn’t look right.
 The flaps were relatively permanent after they were created.
The patient had to live with the results, like it or not.
Moving to the scalp reduction technique
The first of the creative solutions to the problems with the flap
technique (see the previous section) came in the late 1970s with
the scalp reduction procedure for the treatment of balding in the
crown area. The procedure was defined by Dr. Blanchard and 
Dr. Bosley commercialized this technique and published the first
large series of scalp reductions. With a business focus, Dr. Bosley
created his own terminology for the procedure, calling it male 
pattern reduction.
The essence of this surgery was removal of the bald spot in the 
top and back of the head. After the bald spot was removed, the
surgeon lifted the entire scalp off the head to gain looseness and
then attempted to pull the scalp together from the sides to close
the defect. Sometimes the defect was too wide to close, so the
patient would have only part of his balding spot removed and
would return for more surgery some months later. See Figure 12-2.
With a bald area 6 inches wide, it may have taken six or more 
surgeries to cut out the entire bald area, and the patient was 
left with an ugly scar where the scalp was put back together.
Sometimes more surgeries were required to address stretched
scars, and as more and more scalp was removed in successive 
surgical procedures, the hair on the sides of the head became
stretched, reducing the density of the side hair.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 193

Figure 12-2: Scalp reduction surgery. 
The procedure didn’t even solve the problem of a bald crown,
instead placing a scar in a bald of otherwise normal scalp. This led
patients to need hair transplants just to cover the scar and make
the crown appear normal.
The scalp reduction surgery was a radical, yet a simple procedure,
and the number of surgeries performed spread like wildfire. It
could be done in under 30 minutes and cost only $1,500 to $3,000.
So the scalp reduction flourished among some cosmetic surgeons,
who seemed to forget that patients were paying for the removal of
their bald spots with pain, suffering, deformities (see Figure 12-3),
and seemingly never ending surgeries.
Although thought to be an attractive solution for the bald male 
at the time, scalp reduction surgery has since fallen out of favor
due to high complication rates, high failure rate with bald spot
recurrence, poor aesthetic results, and a disgruntled patient 
population. This procedure brought out the worst of the doctor’s
greed for the high surgical fees.
Dr. Mario Marzola tried to improve upon the scalp reduction by
dissecting the scalp down to the level of the ears so that more of
the lifted scalp could cover a wider defect. With his ability to
stretch the sides of the scalp, he was able to remove a wider area
of bald skin so the patient would, in theory, require less surgeries.
In 1983, he performed the first scalp lift, but to maximize the
amount of bald area he removed, he had to cut the nerves on the
sides of the head leaving the entire scalp without feeling. Definitely
not an acceptable side effect.

Finding ways to produce 
more natural results
In spite of many missteps, the drive to develop better surgical
techniques to move hair around the head led to procedures that
were more cosmetically beneficial for the patient.
The usefulness of very small grafts (called micrografts) in hair
transplantation was first recognized in the early 1980s. These
grafts of a few hairs each were mostly limited to placement in the
very front of the hairline because of considerable difficulties in
handling and placing them into the bald scalp.
A hair transplant that relied entirely on the use of micrografts was
first introduced in 1982 in Brazil by Dr. Carlos Uebel. He reduced
the size of the grafts (sometimes called plugs), but he wasn’t able
to master the graft survival issues. Although he succeeded in
making the results look more normal and natural, the survival of
the hairs wasn’t great, and the final result looked very thin.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 195

Over the following two decades, transplant surgeons working on
ever smaller grafts figured out ways to handle these fragile grafts
without killing them. The secret lay in preventing the grafts from
drying and in delicate handling during the harvesting and place-
ment process. In refining the technique, doctors came to under-
stand that moving more hair in the transplant would eventually
lead to fuller and better aesthetic results. The technique defined
by Dr. Uebel evolved into what’s now called the megasession, large
session transplant surgeries.
In 1994, Dr. William Rassman (one of the illustrious authors of this
very book) refined the process and published the first medical 
articles on the megasession. He also started to show off the 
procedure’s results at medical meetings by bringing patients as
part of his academic presentations.
In 1995, he demonstrated that grafting large sessions of small
grafts wasn’t just theoretical, but practical by bringing 23 patients
to the International Society of Hair Restorations Surgeons meeting;
the patients had experienced considerable balding and had 
undergone transplants with thousands of very small grafts.
In articles published in 1995 and 1997, Drs. Bernstein and Rassman
defined what’s now the gold standard in today’s hair transplant
field: They developed a hair transplant procedure that could, in
many respects, replicate nature by moving hair follicles in their
normal anatomical groups of one, two, three, and four hairs — the
follicular unit in one or two surgical sessions. 
Finally transplanting hair as it grows in nature made the results
identical to nature’s own. This technique they defined is now
known as follicular unit transplantation (FUT).
The Newest Transplanting
Techniques
In hair transplantation, size does matter! In this case, it’s the size of
the grafts that make the difference, and smaller is better. To make
up for the small grafts with less hair, large sessions of grafts
became necessary. In this section, we look at the refinements that
have made hair transplants less detectable than ever before.
Avoiding the “hair transplant” look
A bad hair transplant is easy to spot. The uneven, patchy effect 
of large, pluggy grafts occurs when a surgeon uses larger grafts
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
196

containing many follicular units and the spaces between the grafts
are wide. As the grafts heal, they contract and create a contrast
between the bald skin and the islands or clumps of hair. Ultimately,
the patient is left with a scalp resembling a doll’s head.
Larger graft hair transplants took more skin from the scalp, and it
produced subtle deformities in the scalp. Skin abnormalities with
larger grafts occur for three reasons:
 The surface of the transplanted skin may not be aligned with
the surface of the surrounding scalp. This problem develops
in larger hair grafts when the transplanted skin has enough
mass to produce the problem.
 Scar contraction and/or skin dimpling may occur at the recipi-
ent site during the healing process. As the grafts increase in
size, these abnormalities occur with increasing visibility.
 As the skin of the graft heals, the melanocytes (the part of the
skin that produces pigment) may not recover from the trans-
plant process and give the graft a whitish appearance. This is
particularly a problem for anyone with a dark skin color.
Hair in its natural state is composed of hair groupings of follicular
units that have one to four hairs close together. In nature, the lead-
ing edge of one’s hairline is comprised solely of single-hair 
follicular units with less density than the hair further back on the
head. To appear natural, a hair transplant should simulate that
look as closely as possible.
To understand the terminology of hair grafts used by different 
surgeons, hair grafts can be divided into four general categories:
 A traditional standard graft, or plug, is 3 to 4 mm in diameter
and has 12 to 30 hairs.
 A minigraft is 1.2 to 2.5 mm in diameter and has 4 to 12 hairs. 
 A micrograft is 1.0 to 1.5 mm or less in diameter and has one
to three hairs.
 A follicular unit is a naturally growing group of one to 
four hair follicles. Follicular units are smaller in size than 
minigrafts or micrografts containing the same amount 
of hair because the hair exit the skin from roughly the same
pore on the scalp. 
You should discuss the size of the grafts and the planned distribu-
tion of the grafts in detail with your surgeon. Some surgeons 
use larger grafts for some of their work and then use smaller grafts
in an attempt to hide the larger grafts. Others only transplant 
small grafts.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 197

Some hair transplant surgeons invent unusual terms for grafts to
make it appear that they have some special, unique knowledge 
or technique. These terms are intended to imply special variations
in graft sizes or an invisible appearance of the grafts. Don’t be
fooled by this terminology.
You should be wary when a doctor claims to have a unique 
technology or technique that no other doctor knows about or
uses, unless it’s documented and published in a peer-reviewed
medical journal.
Small versus large hair grafts
To meet the demand for natural-looking hairlines, doctors began
decreasing the size of hair grafts in the 1980s, because of the 
following large graft disadvantages:
 Large hair grafts are more visible during the transition period
after transplantation before the hair grows in. Skin deformities
show up almost immediately after the hair transplant.
 Large hair grafts placed in a frontal hairline look pluggy and
unnatural when the hair is combed back or to the side.
Patients were forced to comb their hair forward and down to
hide their hairlines.
 When large hair grafts are placed behind the hairline or in the
crown, they look like patchy clumps of hair (even in the most
gifted surgical hands) and these are very difficult to disguise
or camouflage.
 As healing occurs in three to four mm hair grafts, the grafts
contract, pushing the hairs in the graft together and increas-
ing the density of the hair within the graft. The hair density
within these larger grafts often exceeds the hair density in the
donor area, contributing to the pluggy, stalk-like appearance
of traditional grafts.
 Larger hair graft repairs force the patient to undergo multiple
transplant sessions in the quest for natural-looking results,
and the patient’s appearance can be strikingly unnatural until
the work is completed.
It takes four to six days for the buds of new capillary blood vessels
to grow into the hair grafts from the surrounding tissue. Until 
these new blood vessels grow into the graft, the graft’s cells
depend upon the surrounding tissue to bring the needed oxygen
and nutrients for their survival.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
198

Hair follicle cells have a very high metabolic rate, and they require
more oxygen and nutrients than other cells. If the graft is too large,
the cells of the follicles in the center of the graft may die before
sufficient oxygen and nutrients can reach the center of the graft.
The follicles at the periphery of the graft survive because they’re
close to the body’s nourishing oxygen and fluids. 
When hair finally grows from larger grafts, those in the center die
and this creates a doughnut configuration, with hair at the edges
and a bald central area of skin. This is one of the numerous rea-
sons why many doctors have changed to the use of exclusively
smaller grafts.
Small hair grafts also have some disadvantages.
 The amount of time and work needed to place tiny grafts is
greater than what’s needed with larger grafts.
 Smaller hair grafts produce a thinner hair appearance, so
many more graft units are needed to produce a natural look.
Minis, micros, and more
Minigrafts and micrografts consist of multiple (partial or complete)
follicular units along with the intervening skin. This technique
solves the problem of the hairs in the center of the graft dying off,
but the contraction of the graft in the healing process still pro-
duces a denser graft than normally found throughout the scalp.
These grafts also can cause loss of pigment cells, which can be a
particular problem for people with darker colored skin. 
Although minigrafts and micrografts are a significant improvement
over larger hair grafts, they’re not ideal. The idea behind them 
is reasonable: to keep the number of hairs in each graft low and
spread more hair in these smaller grafts around. But the following
problems are common with minigrafts and micrografts:
 Surgeons may move more hair in minigrafts and micrografts,
but these grafts appear clumpy if they’re not limited to the
natural growing groups of hair. Focusing on the naturally
growing groups and keeping them intact prevents transplants
from looking clumpy.
 Minigrafts and micrografts aren’t harvested with a high 
powered microscope, so many follicular units are broken
apart and the hairs within them are transected during their
preparation, which produces significant hair damage and a
reduced hair yield.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 199

 When minigrafting and micrografting is done with a multi-
bladed knife, the hairs within the knife path break up and the
naturally occurring follicular units are unavoidably damaged.
 Micrografts tend to have more skin in the graft, which makes
them lose their skin pigment. Even micrografts containing as
few as two or three hairs may contain the skin between two
follicular units, which is unnecessary.
 Micrografts look thin when used exclusively over the entire
head and may produce inconsistent graft growth. Follicular
damage also contributes to this thin appearance.
Many surgeons promote a variant of minigrafts called a double 
follicular units (DFU), in which two follicular units are used, each
containing one to three hairs. The main disadvantage of the DFU 
is that there’s intact skin between the follicular units, and particu-
larly in the dark-haired, light-skinned, or coarse-haired person, 
the skin produces a small, white scar as well as cobblestoning
(irregularities) on the scalp surface.
This is a subtle change, but one that’s visible on close inspection,
particularly in bright sunlight. The loudest complaints about such
defects come from patients who can see on themselves the points
where the transplanted hair exits the skin.
Hybrid grafting techniques
The use of larger hair grafts for the top and non-central portion of
the crown and smaller grafts for the frontal hairline and perimeter
of the transplant has a variety of names including blend grafting
and variagrafting. Although this hybrid approach is detectable on
close inspection, it may not be noticeable in a social setting unless
the hair is wet or the patient is in bright sunlight. The results from
larger grafts are best in patients with curly, white, or blonde hair.
If you have curly or wavy hair, the hybrid approach or the use of
DFUs (refer to the previous section for an explanation of DFUs)
may be a reasonable way to reduce the costs of the hair transplant.
If you have straight hair, such an approach can be disastrous, par-
ticularly if your hair color stands out against distinctly contrasting
skin tones (for example, you have dark hair and fair skin). All
larger graft procedures generally cost less if the surgeon charges
by the graft, and the procedures can be performed without the
intense labor required for larger sessions of small grafts.
Another disadvantage of larger grafts may become more evident
when further hair loss occurs, particularly when recession allows
the grafts to be viewed from a different angle. Using larger grafts or
DFUs is more a short-term economic fix than a long-term solution,
and we don’t recommend it.

Follicular unit transplantation
Follicular unit transplantation (FUT) was the most significant
advance in hair restoration since hair transplants were introduced
in the U.S. in 1959.
In follicular unit transplantation, hair is transplanted from the 
permanent zone (from the back and sides of the scalp) into areas
affected by balding, using only the naturally occurring, individual
follicular units. Drs. Bernstein and Rassman first described this
procedure in the 1995 Journal of Aesthetic and Restoration Surgery.
Because of its superior aesthetic results, follicular unit transplanta-
tion soon became the gold standard for hair transplantation 
surgery worldwide.
An essential component of FUT is the use of stereo-microscopic
dissection — a technique developed by Dr. Limmer in the late
1980s for dissecting micrografts. Applying this technique to FUT,
all the follicular units are removed from the donor tissue under
microscopic control to avoid damage. 
Complete stereo-microscopic dissection increases the yield of the
number of follicular units as well as the total amount of hair
(upwards of 25 percent). The hair seems to come out of a single
hole and that the hairs are bundled together in their naturally
growing groups.
The essence of the follicular unit approach to hair transplantation
is that the characteristics of the patient’s hair dictate the size of
the implant (rather than the doctor or the surgical team). For
example, single follicular units are placed in such a way as to
create the natural look of gradually increased density as you go
further back behind the hairline. 
Still, the surgeon determines distribution, hair direction, and the
balance between smaller one-hair grafts and larger two-, three-,
and four-hair grafts. By preserving both the natural physiologic
and aesthetic elements of your own hair, the best cosmetic results
can be achieved.
While the term “follicular unit transplant” may be in vogue with
most savvy patients and doctors today, not all doctors and their
staff have the knowledge or the technical capacity to perform a
large transplant made up exclusively of follicular units.
Very few surgeons and practices have mastered the ability to 
adequately control quality while performing FUT and follicular unit
extraction because the learning curve is very slow and the doctor
must commit considerable time and money to this endeavor.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 201

Instead, some medical groups may use different graft sizes and
hybrid techniques to speed up the process — at the expense of the
final result.
Here are some of the many advantages of FUT over mini-
micrografting or DFUs:
 FUT, when placed in adequate quantities, produces a fuller
look because the grafts can be of the same size (or even
smaller) than micrografts yet contain more hair and less skin.
 The growth is more consistent with FUT than when the 
follicular units are split up, and dividing the units increases
the risk of follicular injury.
 Because follicular unit grafts are less bulky than DFUs, recipi-
ent wounds heal more quickly. The sites in the recipient area
are smaller, making the results look more natural.
 FUT allows the surgeon to distribute grafts to mimic the way
hair grows naturally in the patient’s own scalp.
 Because of the greater precision of the harvesting process,
FUT enables the surgeon to restore more hair using a smaller
amount of donor tissue than with minigrafting, micrografting,
or DFUs.
 The skin between the follicular groups is trimmed away when
only follicular units are used, and the vital support structures
around the unit are preserved. Cobblestoning (irregularities in
the surface of the scalp) and depigmentation (the appearance
of whitish blemishes on the transplanted skin) are avoided
because excess skin in the grafts is removed, making the
grafts significantly less bulky and the holes that they’re
placed into much smaller.
 Because of the very small recipient sites, larger concentra-
tions of follicular units may be safely placed into the bald
area, opening the possibility of creating a higher hair density
in a single session. More density in these recipient sites
reduces the necessity for multiple procedures. The patient
benefits significantly with less time devoted to hair restora-
tion surgery without sacrificing the quality of the grafts on
close inspection.
With the goal of harvesting follicular units from the back of the
scalp without a linear scar, a number of doctors began working on
a direct extraction technique. In 2002, Drs. Rassman and Bernstein
described their technique, called follicular unit extraction (FUE),
which we discuss next. This procedure allows the surgeon to
remove individual follicular units directly from the donor scalp
with a punch of 1 millimeter or less in size instead of a linear 
donor incision. 
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
202

This technique, suitable for a select group of patients, eliminates
the need for strip harvesting and is a further refinement in FUT.
The technology for performing this technique has, at the time of
this writing, made significant strides.
Harvesting Your Hair
There are five common methods of harvesting donor grafts, but
only two methods — single strip harvesting and follicular unit
extraction (FUE) — are used today.
Single strip harvesting
Single strip harvesting removes the donor tissue as a single strip.
The strip of scalp is then divided into smaller sections using a 
dissecting stereo-microscope; it allows total visual control over 
the procedure and avoids the unnecessary cutting of hair follicles.
(We explain stereo-microscope dissection in the earlier section,
“Follicular unit transplantation.”) The stereo-microscope keeps
potential damage to follicles to an absolute minimum, and doctors
can preserve the intact naturally occurring follicular units.
The great advantage of this method is that the tissue is removed
from the scalp with minimal blind cutting because of the use of
stereo-microscopic dissection.
Advantages of strip harvesting under microscopic control is that
there’s a very high hair yield with an experienced team, and the
scar usually is detectable only if you cut your hair to a military
buzz cut. Other than the scar and a slightly painful recovery 
period of a day or two, the strip harvesting procedure is more 
cost-effective and more efficient from a time perspective. Most
importantly, the yield of hair is consistently superior to harvesting
without the benefits of a high powered microscope. 
The FUE technique can also produce superior hair yields, espe-
cially with new technology just being developed. The problem with
FUE is that it is very taxing on the surgeon doing the procedure
and requires intense concentration for prolonged periods of time
to perform the surgery. The surgeon’s fatigue becomes a factor
when this technique is extended to more than 1000 grafts.
Robotic hair transplantation, presently on the horizon, will use the
FUE harvesting technique as its mainstay for harvesting. Robots
will not fatigue as humans do when harvesting follicular units and
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 203

because of this, robot assisted harvesting promises to produce 
a technology that will be far superior to hair transplantation done
by hand. 
Follicular unit extraction
Follicular unit extraction (FUE) allows the surgeon to remove 
individual follicular units without making a linear donor incision
and without removing a strip of donor scalp. This technique has
evolved into a minimally invasive technique, just like the evolution
of surgeries in the brain, heart, joints, prostate, and intestinal areas
where classical incisions have been abandoned for most surgeries. 
Individual follicular units are extracted directly from the donor
area with a punch of less than 1 mm in size. In contrast to the old
punch method in which the punch cut out many follicular units 
in one swipe in order to remove the grafts, in FUE only a single 
follicular unit of between one and four hairs is removed directly
from the patient’s scalp.
 In the one-step technique, the doctor uses a sharp punch to
surround the targeted graft and then pushes it into the scalp
to a depth of approximately 5 mm. The edge is grasped with
forceps, and the entire graft is pulled out from the scalp.
 In the two-step process, the skin is cut to a depth of less than
1 mm and then the doctor uses a dull punch to dissect the
graft from the deep structures below the skin. The freed graft
is grasped with forceps and pulled from the scalp.
The advantage of the two-step over the one-step technique is that
the extraction process minimizes (but doesn’t entirely eliminate)
injury to the follicles in some patients.
FUE has the following advantages:
 There’s no linear scar in the donor area. Of course a scar
always results from every skin incision, but since scars are
very small and scattered in a larger area, they often aren’t
detectable even when the hair is relatively short.
 There are no sutures or staples to be removed. The small
donor wounds are left to close on their own with no sutures
or bandages, and they heal within a few days.
 There’s minimal discomfort in the donor area after the
grafts are removed.
 Exercise and athletic activities can be resumed within a
week after the procedure is performed.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
204

Following are some of the disadvantages of FUE:
 Not everyone is a good candidate for this procedure. Not all
doctors agree, but we always test our patients first by taking
several biopsies using different FUE instruments and viewing
the grafts under a microscope to see whether we can harvest
the follicular units without significantly damaging the hair 
follicles. If we see a significant amount of damaged follicles,
we don’t recommend this procedure for a patient. 
 It’s more expensive than strip harvesting. FUE is very
tedious, and every graft should be individually extracted by
the surgeon as opposed to the strip method, in which skin is
removed first and grafts are harvested under a microscope,
generally by a skilled team of dissectors.
 For the same number of grafts, FUE takes more time, 
sometimes over twice the time, when compared to a strip
procedure.
 FUE produces small puncture scars. That means that if you
shave your head, you may see small, whitish dots. There’s no
linear scar and the stretched scars of a more traditional strip
harvest is virtually eliminated. It is very difficult to detect the
FUE scars.
 A large area of the scalp needs to be shaved or clipped very
short when a large session of over 600 grafts is performed.
Many patients object to this requirement because of the 
radical change in their hair styling. In small FUE procedures
(under 600 grafts), the areas shaved are generally small, and
your doctor will try to shave the areas so that they can be
camouflaged by existing hair as much as possible until the
hair regrows. 
We advise patients undergoing small FUE to keep their hair
long enough to cover small shaved strips of scalp. In larger
FUE procedures, the shaved areas may be too large to be 
camouflaged after the surgery. This contrasts dramatically to
a strip that can almost always be covered by existing hair
immediately after the strip harvesting procedure.
 FUE can produce damage that ranges from cutting of the
hair follicles to destruction of vital elements of the graft 
in the hands of inexperienced surgeons. The percentage 
of such damage should be under 10 percent, but that’s 
still a significant amount considering that in traditional strip
harvesting surgery, the follicular units taken from the strip
under the microscope are mostly perfect.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 205

The Hype About Hair Cloning
Modern hair transplants can greatly improve your appearance, but
they have limitations. You can only transplant as much hair as is
available in donor areas, and the older you get, the balder you get,
so you need to cover larger bald areas with decreasing amounts of
donor hair.
But what if you could clone your hair — have one hair replicated 
in the lab so that it would produce many hairs? The donor supply
would be limitless. As simple as hair looks to the naked eye, it 
may seem that cloning hair wouldn’t be all that difficult. There’s a
lot more to hair, however, than meets the eye. Hair follicles are
complex, containing skin cells, fat, blood vessels, nerves, muscles,
and glands. 
There’s also a lot more to hair cloning; potential methods include
genetic engineering of the cells, so you never lose your hair in the
first place, as well as developing techniques to multiply your own
hair cells; we discuss them all in the next sections.
“Inducing” new hair growth
In the late 1990s, a British scientist named Dr. Jahoda took dermal
sheath cells (cells from the lowest part of the hair follicle) from his
own scalp and transplanted them into his wife’s forearm. These
cells stimulated new hair growth on his wife’s arm, and the cells,
when analyzed, contained both of the couple’s DNA. The fact that
his DNA was in her forearm conclusively showed that, at least in
this one surgery, he had conquered part of the cloning process.
The results of this experiment have two interesting applications for
future hair cloning:
 The dermal sheath cells act as “inducer” cells, inducing 
new hair growth without having to transplant the whole hair
follicle.
 The dermal sheath cells seem to be immune privileged
organs, which means they can be transplanted from one
person to another without being rejected.
Even more importantly from a cloning perspective is that “inducer”
dermal sheath cells are fibroblasts, which are among the easiest
cells to culture. If these cells can be cultured in the lab, a person’s
own donor area could potentially serve as an unlimited source of
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
206

hair for the cloning process. That’s what everyone wants to hear,
but at the time of writing this book, the cloning process clearly
isn’t there yet. Look for more advances in this area, though!
Some issues and problems to overcome in the area of hair cloning
include:
 Dermal sheath cells are difficult to isolate.
 The ability to culture the cells has to be proven.
 The cells need to grow in the right direction — through the
scalp instead of under the skin or downward.
 It’s not certain that the induced follicles will continue to grow
hair after the initial hair growth is shed (normal hair grows in
cycles of two to six years).
 The cultured cells may revert to an undifferentiated state and
stop growing hair over time.
 It’s unknown whether the inducer cells may also induce
tumors or encourage malignant growths.
 FDA testing and approval will take years.
Using genetic engineering to isolate
and correct hair loss genes
Rather than replicating a new organism, genetic engineering alters
the DNA of a particular cell so that it can manufacture proteins to
correct genetic defects or produce other beneficial changes.
Genetic engineering involves three steps:
1. Isolate the problem gene(s).
2. Clone (multiply) the gene(s).
3. Insert the gene inside the cell so that it can correct 
the problem.
The first gene causing hair loss in humans was discovered by Dr.
Christiano at Columbia University. She found that individuals with
this gene are born with hair that soon falls out (as infant hair often
does) but then never grows back. Unfortunately, this isn’t the gene
that causes male pattern baldness (which is probably the result of
more than one gene), but labs are working to isolate the genes
responsible for that widespread condition.
Chapter 12: Hair Restoration Options: Past and Present 207

Multiplying hairs
In hair multiplication, hairs are simply plucked from the scalp or
beard and implanted into the bald part of the scalp. The idea is
that some germinative cells at the base of the hair follicle are
pulled out along with the hair, and when the hair is implanted,
these cells should be able to regenerate a new follicle at the
removal site and produce a grown hair at the implant site.
In other words, one beard hair removed and implanted in the bald
scalp would produce a beard hair in the bald scalp and in the
removal site.
In theory, microscopic examination of the plucked hair could 
help the doctor determine which hairs have the most stem cells
attached and thus which are most likely to regrow. The procedure
is called hair multiplication because the plucked follicles regrow 
a new hair, potentially giving an unlimited supply.
In a modification of this procedure, the bulbs of the hair are 
separated from the shafts and then cultivated in vitro (outside 
the body). After the cells multiply, they’re injected into the pores
of local, dormant hair follicles in the balding area. 
There are three areas where stem cells can be found in the 
human hair: 
 Above the sebaceous gland near the epidermis in the upper
1mm of the hair follicle
 At the sebaceous gland 2-3 mm down on the hair follicle
 Just below the sebaceous gland (the bulge area about 3-4mm
down on the hair follicle)
The problem with obtaining stem cells with either technique (hair
multiplication and modification) is that:
 The plucked cells are only transient amplifiers (cells that 
grow quickly but for only a limited amount of time before they
die out).
 The stem cells around the bulge region of the follicle — the
ones most important for hair growth — aren’t harvested in
any significant numbers and can’t be readily stimulated to
produce a hair.

S
urgery can be a daunting prospect even when it’s medically
necessary, so it’s no surprise that undergoing elective surgery
for a cosmetic procedure can be a little frightening. In this chapter,
we cover all aspects of hair transplant surgery, starting with help-
ing you to determine whether it’s a viable option for you. We walk
you through the requirements and costs as well as help you find
the right surgeon (not necessarily the one with the biggest ad in
the phone book). We prepare you to visit possible surgeons and
make sure you go in as an informed patient. You find out what
you’ll face before, during, and after surgery, and we help you be
realistic about the possible post-op complications and results that
may send you back for additional transplants.
Are You a Candidate for Hair
Transplant Surgery?
Do you really need a hair transplant? At first glance, this may seem
like a silly question. But hair transplantation shouldn’t be your first
thought when you start losing your hair. Most candidates for hair
transplantation are men with male pattern balding, which takes
years to develop. Young men who have just started losing their
hair don’t know how far their hair loss may progress or how fast.
Finding an extra hair or two in the sink or in your comb doesn’t
mean you need a hair transplant tomorrow — or ever.

Not everyone who’s balding is a good candidate for hair transplan-
tation. The best candidates for transplant are those who have the
following:
 Male pattern baldness
 Enough donor hair to supply balding areas
 Very little color contrast between the skin and hair color
(such as blond hair on a light skin tone, white hair on fair
skin, or brown hair on brown skin) if your donor hair supply is
limited or you’re very bald
 High-density concentrations of donor hair supply
 A loose, flexible scalp
 Hair shaft diameters with reasonable bulk (coarser hair makes
for a better candidate than finer hair)
 Realistic expectations and a good understanding of the
process
In this section, we look more closely at who should consider a
transplant, who shouldn’t, and why.
Those who don’t qualify 
for a hair transplant
Among the people who probably aren’t good candidates for hair
transplantations are
 Most women. Unlike men, who generally have a permanent
donor supply of good, healthy hair on the sides and back of
the head (fringe area), women tend to thin all over the scalp
including that fringe area. Using a thin donor supply of hair
for transplant greatly increases the likelihood of unsuccessful
or poor results.
 Men with the condition diffuse unpatterned alopecia
(DUPA). These men have an unhealthy donor supply, making
them poor candidates for a hair transplant.
 People with diseased donor supply for any reason. This is
more common in women than in men and typical for some
forms of genetic androgenetic alopecia in women.
 Those with low hair densities.
 Those with a tight or inelastic scalp. This rule does not apply
to the ‘follicular unit extraction’ method of harvesting where
the tightness of the scalp is not a factor for hair transplant
candidacy.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
210

 Those with a lack of adequate funds to continue surgical
hair restoration over time.
Those who may qualify and benefit
from a hair transplant
A healthy area of donor hair is essential for a good hair transplant,
so if you have that, you’re already in a good position for the 
procedure.
Men over age 30 with established male pattern baldness are often
more deliberate than others about the decision to undergo hair
transplant surgery. They’re more likely to have given the matter
considerable thought, thoroughly researching the options and 
finding a doctor they trust. Sometimes a change in lifestyle precipi-
tates the decision, such as a search for a new job, a divorce, or
simply the financial ability to indulge themselves.
The best transplant patients are educated about their hair loss and
set realistic expectations for the success of a transplant. They
must learn, in advance, the realities of what a hair transplant can
and can not do. You don’t have to go bald before you go the hair
transplant route, but it’s best if you’re informed and mature.
Even if you have male pattern baldness, which could eventually be
helped by transplant, hair loss at its earliest stage is best treated
with medication. The use of medication may forestall a transplant
for years. 
Unfortunately, young people in a panic may fall prey to unscrupu-
lous physicians whose practices are built on selling hair trans-
plants to those in an emotionally fragile state. Men under 25 years
old should think twice before they undergo a surgical solution and
should ask themselves the following questions:
 Have I looked into other options?
 Does my hair loss really bother me that much?
 Have I given medication a try and waited long enough to see
the results?
 Have I thought through the financial implications of multiple
surgeries over my lifetime?
 What will happen if I continue to lose hair after the surgery 
is done?
 What balding pattern does the doctor think I’m heading for?
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 211

It’s the responsibility of the physician to make sure that an emo-
tionally distraught patient is making informed choices and under-
stands the long-term implications of any treatment option —
especially surgery. With younger patients, it’s often prudent to
slow down the decision-making process through multiple consulta-
tions, stressing the importance of drug therapy, and when appro-
priate, getting parents or other significant persons involved. Your
doctor should allow you to reflect on the situation and the deci-
sions involved — and should never rush to operate. Our rule of
thumb for those considering a hair transplant is to delay the deci-
sion until they fully understand what it is all about. We tell every-
one: A good decision today will be a good decision tomorrow. 
Psychological Considerations 
for Hair Transplantation
Modern society is preoccupied with hair; it symbolizes youth,
health, sexuality, and individual style in today’s culture.
Throughout history, the presence or absence of hair has affected
the way people are viewed. For example, during the Middle Ages,
men who experienced poor health also had hair loss; as a result,
society established biased opinions equating good health — and
desirability — with a full head of hair. Unfortunately for some, that
public opinion has proven to be pretty persistent.
Balding can make you feel like you’ve lost control. Hair is one of
the few body parts that you can manipulate: You can grow it long,
cut it off, wave it, dye it, or pull it back in a ponytail. But you can’t
control when and how it grows naturally. Hair also serves as a form
of self-expression, and as you start to lose it, you may become
depressed and withdrawn. Men who lose their hair feel that
they’ve lost control of the image they present to the world — and
to themselves.
Hair loss isn’t just a physical change. It also has many less tangible
effects, namely on your
 Self esteem
 Stress level
 Sex life
 Career choices
There are plenty of studies of the psychological impact of balding
but few studies have examined the psychological improvement
after hair transplant surgery. Having seen the drastic changes in
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
212

patient behavior and the high level of patient satisfaction following
hair transplant procedures, we decided to take a look at data 
supplied by mail-in questionnaires we sent out after transplant 
surgery.
We selected 200 patients who had hair transplants within the 
previous one to three years for male pattern balding and sent them
open-ended questionnaires that focused on eight major criteria.
Included were questions on the general level of happiness, energy
level, feeling of youthfulness, anxiety level, self confidence, outlook
on one’s future, and impact on one’s sex life. We received 37 
anonymous, voluntary responses (an 18.5 percent return rate),
which we share in Appendix C. Patients described significant
improvements in all eight criteria regardless of their stage of 
baldness and their ages.
In another attempt to compare psychological changes that patients
experienced after surgery to address different stages of baldness,
we divided patients into two groups (turn to Chapter 4 for an
explanation of the Norwood classification system):
 Those who had Norwood Class IV hair loss patterns or less
(not so bald)
 Those who had Norwood Class V hair loss patterns and above
(very bald)
We observed the most significant difference between the groups in
the two categories of sex life and career. Transplant had a greater
impact on sex life and career in people who had less hair loss at
the time of transplant compared to those who had more advanced
stages of hair loss. These changes weren’t age-related.
Not surprisingly, patients who suffer the most from hair loss are
the most likely to benefit psychologically. In early stages of hair
loss, patients may be more aware of their condition and be more
affected than men in the later stages of hair loss, especially if a
patient’s hair loss occurs at an early age, when his social life is
likely to be more active and more fragile.
Although each individual’s motives may vary, it’s understandable
for people at any age to want to improve their appearance, and
hair has a great impact in this regard. However, a decision to pro-
ceed with hair restoration should be made with a clear head, a spe-
cific objective, and as much factual information as possible in
order to establish realistic expectations.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 213

On the other hand, when hair loss becomes an obsession, it’s rare
that either medical treatments or surgery satisfy the patient’s need
for perfection. If the patient’s emotional reaction to his hair loss far
exceeds the degree of hair loss, or if his expectations of treatment
are more than can be achieved with existing technology, psycho-
logical counseling may be in order.
Realistic expectations are critical before undergoing a surgical hair
restoration procedure. Any transplant done in the face of unrealis-
tic expectations is doomed to failure. Realistic expectations for a
hair transplant should be based on proper education, emotional
maturity, and the availability of adequate finances to undergo an
assessment and a hair restoration surgery.

A final result that’s more 
than meets the eye
A patient of Dr. Rassman’s is 55 years old and one of the more powerful men in
America. If you were in a room with 100 men, this successful businessman’s
charisma would make him stand out. Powerful and brilliant men and women always
surrounded him, but secretly, he felt insecure, not with his abilities but with his aging
appearance, epitomized by his balding.
Although his wife appeared supportive of his transplant decision at the time, a few
years after the surgery she came to visit Dr. Rassman and said, “I want to apologize
to you.” The confused doctor asked, “Why do you want to apologize to me?”
She told him about a rift she and her husband had had about his getting the trans-
plant. “I told him that he looked great and that hair wasn’t important. But my husband
has his own mind, and after the only fight we had in our 27-year marriage, I agreed
to go along with him. But I was secretly furious, and I came here today to apologize
if I was rude. You see, after the transplant was done and his hair came back, the
man I married also came back. I never realized that he could ever feel insecure
about what I thought was this ridiculous, unimportant thing called hair. His insecu-
rity was a secret he even kept from me. But when his hair came back, his person-
ality became more open, and his joy of life was enhanced. I saw changes in his
passion for life and for me. The contrast was remarkable. I was selfish to think that
I knew how he felt, but I never realized how important hair could be. So, I am apol-
ogizing to you because I cannot apologize to him.”
Needless to say, Dr. Rassman was touched by her apology.

Having Enough Hair 
for a Transplant
Needing to cover a large balding area with a small supply of good,
healthy donor hair can make the hair transplant option a “no-go.”
Obviously, the larger your balding areas, the less donor hair you
have. But you don’t need to restore your hair all the way to its orig-
inal density to develop the appearance of fullness.
For example, uniformly pulling out every other hair (50 percent)
from the head of a person with black, medium-weight hair and
white skin won’t change the person’s appearance much at all. At 75
percent uniform hair loss, this person will start to show significant
hair thinning, but it’s still disguisable with good styling techniques
that layer the hair. In contrast, a blond with 75 percent hair loss
may show no thinning because of the uniform color of the hair and
the light-colored scalp. At 90 percent loss, the black-haired, white-
skinned person will show severe thinning, whereas the blond-
haired person with light skin color may lose up to 90 percent of his
hair and still look reasonably full-haired. It’s not fair, we know!
There’s an art as well as a science to the hair transplant process. A
good surgeon can achieve the illusion of fullness even when the
need for hair follicles exceeds the supply. For example, it’s not
unusual for the hair restoration surgeon to restore just one area of
the bald scalp in a very bald person; putting hair in the front and
leaving the crown thin or bald creates a natural-looking variation of
a typical balding man who has only crown balding. Viewed from
the front, the hair looks normal, whereas from the back the balding
crown is visible.
People are born with varying numbers of hair on their heads, rang-
ing from 60,000 to 150,000 hairs. If a man is born with 60,000 hairs
and loses 70 percent of them, he would only have 15,000 hairs left,
most of which would be needed to cover the areas around the side
and back of the head where all of the good donor hair is found.
At the other extreme, a man born with 150,000 hairs who loses 75
percent would have 37,500 hairs on the side and back of his head.
Redistributing 20,000 hairs may be enough to cover the entire bald-
ing head of a very bald man and make him appear as if he has a full
head of hair. 
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 215

Frontal hairline recession, the most common hair loss pattern, may
result in a loss of between 2,000 and 18,000 hairs. Restoring enough
hair to replace what’s been lost is relatively easy in these cases
Surgeons see less successful results from the standpoint of meet-
ing the patient’s expectations when they have considerably fewer
grafts to work with. Although the artistic distribution of 8,000 hairs
(4,000 grafts) may produce the illusion of fullness, it’s a far greater
(if not impossible) challenge to create enough fullness to meet any
reasonable expectations of the patient if only 2,000 hairs (1,000
grafts) are available.
Planning for Possible 
Future Hair Loss
Unfortunately, hair loss doesn’t stop just because you’ve had a
transplant, so any reconstruction work must take into account
what may happen down the road. Your surgeon should develop a
master plan to cover any future hair loss; the plan may include
drugs like Propecia that slow or stop hair loss. Any master plan
should address the following questions:
 What’s the worst-case scenario for hair loss in your lifetime?
The master plan should include short-term and long-term
solutions. Hopefully, the worst-case plan will never be realized,
but it’s critical to include this possibility in your understanding
of your procedure.
 Will there be enough donor hair to replace future hair loss?
If the surgeon doesn’t leave enough hair for the worst-case
scenario, then sooner or later you’ll be up the creek without a
paddle — and without hair, either.
 Will you be able to afford all that’s necessary in the future?
The doctor’s honest description of possible future needs is
crucial to your making an informed, smart decision.
 Are you fully informed about every aspect of the recon-
struction process? We often joke with our patients about
changing our clinic’s name to The No-Surprises Institute for
Hair Reconstruction. Men don’t like surprises, and few things
frighten them more than surprises in cost or in the achieved
results. You shouldn’t be caught unawares in any aspect of
your hair transplant or future treatments.

Assessing the Costs
Hair transplant surgery is generally not covered by insurance
because it’s considered a cosmetic procedure, and that means that
the cost will come right out of your own pocket. And the price can
be high, depending on how much area you want to cover and how
much your surgeon charges.
Hair transplant surgeries are generally charged per graft, with a
graft being one to four hair follicular units. The cost varies between
$3 and $20 per graft. Most people focus on the per graft price, as
this is how most doctors calculate their fee.
For many people, hair transplantation is limited by their financial
constraints. That being said, it’s important to look at the long-run
versus the short-run when selecting your surgical team. In the
short-run, you may save a few hundred, even a few thousand, dol-
lars by going with the least expensive doctor, but if the surgery is
performed incorrectly, if the team isn’t experienced and loses
grafts, or if the surgeon doesn’t have the experience or the artistry
to place grafts properly, you may end up needing more surgery in
the future and worse, you may have a botched job that can not be
fixed. The buyer must realize from the beginning that a hair trans-
plant is permanent and errors of design and good planning may
not be correctable. 
When discussing price, you need to compare apples to apples. One
graft (or follicular unit) contains one, two, three, or sometimes four
hairs. In general, one graft averages about two hairs. Some doctors
add to the confusion by charging per hair to make the procedure
appear less expensive (this is known as graft splitting). Just remem-
ber that 2,000 hairs is around the same as a 1,000-graft surgery.
Sometimes a doctor may make single hair grafts by splitting a two-
hair graft so that he or she can transplant it to the frontal hairline.
But splitting a four-hair graft into two two-hair grafts, or a two-hair
graft into two one-hair grafts, just to push up the total number of
grafts to make the fee appear like a bargain is the same as double-
charging you. Sadly, this is quite a common practice.
Your doctor should be able to explain the exact number of cut
grafts and how the numbers were calculated. Ask your doctor how
the grafts are counted and to see the sheet that lists the numbers
of grafts cut by each technician, because the accounting process of
dissecting grafts is highly variable.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 217

If graft splitting weren’t complicated enough, you also need to be
aware of the “low-ball” sales technique when estimating the
number of grafts needed. In this technique, the estimate of the
work needed increases after the work has already begun. If your
doctor’s initial estimate of how many grafts you need sounds low
because you sense that he/she wants to make the sale, then you
might assume the worst and do some good comparative shopping.
Although the overall cost of a hair transplant is an important
factor in making your decision of whether to move forward with it,
you also need to have an honest, competent doctor whom you can
trust to act in your best interest. The good and bad news about
hair transplantation is that it’s permanent. Unfortunately, the work
of a poor surgeon will be with you for your entire life, so choosing
the right doctor and practice is critical.
Choosing a Doctor
The most important factor in hair transplant surgery is choosing the
right surgeon. You can have a wonderful plan for surgery, a great
medical facility, and marvelous nurses, but if the surgeon doesn’t
plan your reconstruction properly and then do a good job, the whole
thing is for naught. Good planning in how the hair is to be trans-
planted is as important as doing the technical components correctly.
Basically, what you’re looking for is a well-credentialed, caring,
competent, artistic (cosmetic surgery is about 50 percent art)
doctor whom you like and feel comfortable with. This section
guides you through the task of finding a hair transplant surgeon
who’s right for you and helps you prepare yourself for your office
visits to make sure that you get all the information you need to
make an informed selection.
Finding a doctor
The best place to start your search for a hair transplant doctor is
with friends who have had transplants. Talk with them and look at
the quality of their work.
If you don’t have a personal connection to someone who has had a
transplant, start your search on the Internet. The International
Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (www.ishrs.org) lists hun-
dreds of doctors worldwide who work in the field. You also may
want to enter “hair transplantation” along with your city and state
in your favorite search engine, and explore the results.

Meeting for the first consultation
Going in for a surgical consultation is both exciting and a bit scary —
don’t lose your head, though, in your excitement about regaining
your hair.
Always meet with more than one doctor before making a decision.
We also strongly suggest that you look at the Web sites of various
doctors, both in and out of your area. The comprehensive nature
of these sites will give you a feeling of just how good the doctor is
at educating you and sharing his experience and his patient popu-
lation with you.
This section walks you through what to expect at your first meet-
ing, starting with these first steps:
1. The initial interviewer, who may or may not be the
doctor, should provide you with basic information about
the hair transplant procedure.
2. You’ll fill out a basic medical history form to determine
your candidacy for having a surgical procedure.
3. Some assessment of your hair loss may be done, but only
a physician or a specially qualified nurse practitioner or
physician’s assistant may legally perform a physical
examination and render an opinion.
4. A more knowledgeable interviewer may try to determine
whether your expectations are realistic.
In some hair restoration practices, salespeople work at remote
offices without a doctor present. These salespeople function inde-
pendently in many ways and may even wear white coats, implying
some medical expertise. If you visit a remote office staffed with
salespeople, follow these suggestions:
 Ask whether the person you’re meeting with is a salesperson
or doctor. Only a doctor can give you a diagnosis and assess-
ment. A salesperson may be able to educate you on the
process of hair restoration surgery — and that can be very
useful — but he or she shouldn’t give a medical opinion.
 Make certain that salespeople don’t recommend any medical
or surgical treatment. This includes the type of surgical proce-
dures that would be used in your situation, the number of pro-
cedures, or the approximate cost of your restoration. Don’t
accept recommendations without input from a qualified doctor.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 219

 Don’t discuss your financial status with a salesperson. When
a physician is available in the office, the patient educator or
salesperson should call the doctor in to examine your hair
and scalp, quantify the amount of donor hair you have, address
your worst-case balding pattern, and then discuss your surgical
options. When the doctor reviews costs with you, your cost
shouldn’t depend upon what you can afford.
 The doctor should outline a master plan specifically for you
that addresses future hair loss. If you can’t afford what you
need to achieve your goals, ask the doctor whether modifying
your goals is reasonable, and make sure you understand the
implications of modifying your goals.
It’s always best to have the doctor do the entire consultation.
During the consultation, a doctor should
 Educate you in the procedure.
 Take a history.
 Do the physical examination.
 Discuss your options.
 Estimate the number of surgeries it will take to achieve the
desired result.
 Review all the costs involved.
Busier practices may offload some of these tasks to nurses or cleri-
cal people, which may be okay because some of these people will
have more time to spend with you answering your questions than
a doctor would, but nothing can replace the doctor’s advice. One
well-known clinic takes the view that the doctor “just screws up
the sale” and that it’s best to minimize patient-doctor contact. This
view is clearly opposite to our thinking.
A good doctor needs to have a strong team behind him. You should
expect physician extenders to be educated as nurses or certified
physician assistants. Doing refined follicular unit transplantation,
which is today’s standard of care, takes a team of 3 to 6 people
working together for hours. So, the doctor’s team is almost as
important as the doctor is. As the old cliché says, a chain is only as
strong as its weakest link.

220

Asking the right questions
Like buying any big-ticket item, buying a hair transplant requires
extensive research. A good buyer is an educated buyer, so take the
time to do your homework.
First, be sure your doctor practices the standard of care, follicular
unit transplantation, in which individual, naturally growing groups
of hair are microscopically dissected and moved into the balding
area in their anatomical intact units.
When you think you’re ready to sign on the dotted line, pause to
consider the following questions:
 Did the doctor listen to you, give you enough time to voice
concerns, and thoroughly explain the procedure and other
options? Did he or she learn about you and your concerns,
fears, goals, and economic situation? Did the doctor decide
what you will need done to achieve your goals, and are you
confident in that decision? Most people can tell almost imme-
diately whether they trust or like the doctor if the doctor
spends enough time with them.
 How much experience does the doctor have in the hair
restoration field? How is the doctor regarded in the medical
community? 
 Did you receive documents that fully outline the proposed
work? Memories often fail, so the more information that the
doctor gives you in writing, the better the communication will
be between you and your doctor. For example, did you receive
an estimate reflecting the scope of the proposed work and its
costs? Many times it takes more than one hair transplant to
achieve a patient’s need. The patient has every right to know
what is in store for him after the surgery. How many more sur-
geries will be required? The doctor should volunteer this
information, but if not, ask about it.
 How does the doctor estimate the cost for a hair restoration
procedure? Beware of low-balling — underestimating what
you really need to achieve the desired results. Low-balling
bids to make the sale isn’t an uncommon practice in many
industries, but we’re talking about what you’ll look like for the
rest of your life, so low-balling here can have a particularly
dramatic effect.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 221

 Are you being pressured by hard-sell tactics? Too many doc-
tors oversell, even though it’s unethical. Does the doctor keep
putting a salesperson between you? Salespeople may sell the
doctor’s service like a used car. Note: Commission sales in
this field are illegal in most states.
High-pressure sales tactics tell you a lot about the doctor and
his or her integrity. Waiting at least a few days before deciding
on a surgical procedure is never a mistake. We tell patients
that a good decision today is a good decision tomorrow.
 Does the doctor innovate? Is he or she a leader or a follower?
All doctors don’t have to be innovators, provided that they
can deliver a quality service and have learned from the inno-
vators and practice the standard of care. Some doctors mis-
represent themselves to build up an image that they haven’t
earned, such as claiming to be the inventors or pioneers of
the surgeries that they offer. With the Internet as a resource,
it’s relatively easy to verify such claims.
 Has the doctor been bombarded with legal problems? Is his or
her medical legal record clean? Make sure that you have done
your diligence by checking as many sources as you can to
determine the history of the medical practice.
Look up the doctor or the medical group of your choice on
your state’s medical board Web site before making a decision.
(You can find a directory of state medical board contact 
information at www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html.) State
medical boards make available doctors’ records with regard
to legal matters. You may be surprised at what you learn from
the medical board search.
 Does the doctor or salesperson try to find out how much
money you’re planning to spend before giving you an estimate
for the proposed work? That’s a bad sign. The doctor’s first
priority should be what is or isn’t on top of your head, not
what’s in your wallet. You should never feel that a doctor is
trying to pick your pocket!
Seeing results for yourself
Does your doctor offer patient references? Our office promotes a
monthly interaction with our former patients for the purpose of
educating prospective patients about the hair transplant process.
We also allow prospective patients to speak to someone who’s
having the transplant procedure and even watch the process.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
222

There’s no better way to evaluate a doctor’s work than to see it up
close and in person. Good pictures are beneficial, but pictures can
be altered or patients can be photographed in ways that really
don’t reflect the whole truth. When you meet a patient, however,
you can look at him or her from every angle! Ask your doctor for
direct patient references.
It’s best if you can meet with someone who has had a transplant
similar to the one you’re considering. If your doctor doesn’t 
promote face-to-face meetings, before and after pictures taken from
every angle can help you evaluate his or her work.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 223
You can get what you want
A 23-year-old patient had developed the nickname “Captain Forehead” when he
first came to see me (Dr. Rassman). His hairline was very high and had receded
back about 1 inch beyond his original mature hairline. His temple prominences were
set back on his head, and he had the beginning of balding in the crown.
He used a photograph to show me what he wanted to achieve. He earned $9 per
hour, had no savings, and had about $3,000 worth of credit card availability. I real-
ized that his goals were well beyond his ability to pay not only for the first procedure
he would need but for subsequent surgeries if his hair loss should progress, and I
discouraged him from doing the surgery.
Six months later, he made an appointment with my colleague and got on the sur-
gery schedule. I met him again the day after the surgery and was disappointed to
find that he had gone forward with a transplant. To my surprise, I found out that this
young man had moved out of his apartment and into his 1991 Dodge Omni (he was
over 6 feet tall, so it must have been cozy!), where he had lived for the last 6 months.
He saved his pennies, got a loan from his parents, and went to Mexico to purchase
Propecia long before it was released in the United States. I was so impressed with
his focus and dedication that I hired him and put him to work for me educating
patients over the phone. This patient now cuts his hair short and no longer looks
like Captain Forehead. 

Before the Surgery
Different doctors have different rules for what you should and
shouldn’t do before surgery, so always follow your own doctor’s
recommendations. The following are common recommendations:
 Ask if you can have anything at all to eat or drink before 
surgery. 
 If you’re on aspirin or any blood thinner, stop taking it ten
days prior to the surgery.
 Speak to your doctor about any medications you normally
take, and get instructions about what you should and should-
n’t take in the days before surgery and particularly on the
morning of surgery.
 If you’re a diabetic on insulin, ask your doctor what to do with
regard to your insulin use and your diet.
 Wear comfortable clothing that’s easy to remove.
 Ask about using an antibacterial soap on your hair and scalp
the night before and the day of surgery. If the doctor wants
you to use an antibacterial soap, be very careful not to get it in
your eyes as it may be very irritating. If you accidentally get it
in your eyes, rinse your eyes thoroughly with clear water until
the burning subsides. Reducing the bacterial count in the hair
follicles is best done with good washing before the surgery.
Review any paperwork you have before you head in for your 
surgery; this should include all the communications between the
doctor’s office and you. You should have received a copy of the
informed consent form that you have to sign on the morning of the
surgery. This document defines what the surgeon intends to do,
and most important, it defines the risks of the proposed surgery.
You may have questions after reading through it, so jot them down
to ask the doctor if anything is unclear.
When you meet with your doctor prior to the surgery, review the
informed consent document with him or her. It’s not unusual for last-
minute questions to come up; legal documents are often filled with
every possible risk and can be overwhelming and scary to sign.
Ask your doctor what the plan will be if the actual number of grafts
harvested exceeds or falls short of the estimate you’re paying for.
For strip harvesting, this is a critical question because making the
estimation is as much an art as a science. Donor densities vary by
the exact anatomic location on the back and sides of your head, so
estimates are frequently off by 5 to 10 percent. For FUE harvesting,
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
224

quantifying the grafts harvested is far more precise because hair
groupings are removed one at a time. You can find explanations of
these harvesting techniques in Chapter 12.
During the Surgery
Hair transplant surgery is usually performed under local anesthe-
sia, so you’ll probably be awake (although somewhat sedated)
during your procedure. Often pictures are taken of you prior to the
surgery to document your starting point. The surgeon should draw
your new hairline on your head; you should have had considerable
input into the hairline design and location before this point,
because once the hair goes in, it’s too late to change it!
The process of determining your new hairline is your last input
into what the surgeon will do, so make sure that you’ve agreed not
only on the hairline but also on the distribution of hair.
It is difficult to place a hairline and this process requires a friendly
interplay between the surgeon and his patient. There are artistic
considerations for the surgeon and there is often anxiety on the
patient’s part because he must imagine that the hairline that is
drawn in crayon, is just a line. The patient usually goes along with
the surgeon’s suggestions on hairline placement but should voice
concerns on location and balance. 
After you sign all the legal papers, you’ll be given a sedative that
should help you manage any anxiety you may have; many patients
fall asleep within the first hour of the surgery. The procedure is
performed under local anesthetics such as lidocaine or Marcaine
injected to numb your scalp and some mild sedation to help the
patient through the long surgery. Some doctors use a short-acting
narcotic before the local anesthetics are started (like a twilight
sedative), and some also add laughing gas to help you through the
initial phase of the surgery, when there may be some pain. There
should be no pain associated with a hair transplant procedure
aside from some small mosquito bite-type shots during the initial
administration of local anesthesia. The amount of sedation may be
the choice of the doctor or the patient, and the depth of the seda-
tion various with different clinics.
The entire procedure may take place in a surgical chair much like
the chair at your dentist’s office. Some surgeons allow you to sit
up, whereas others lie you flat. You’ll be awake, so you can interact
with the doctor and staff or just relax — watching a movie, listening
to music, or sleeping if you wish. The average surgery takes four to
seven hours, depending upon the number of grafts performed and
the size of the surgical team.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 225

Most of our patients consider surgery day a great day because
they feel good with so many people working on them and taking
care of them, and they remain comfortable from the drugs they
receive.
Because the day can be long, your procedure may include snacks
and meals! In our practices, we serve good food, including shrimp
cocktail and ice cream sundaes for dessert, all in the middle of a hair
transplant procedure. That’s right — you can eat during surgery!
The Night and Morning 
after Surgery
One of the most common patient concerns after any surgery is
what he or she will feel like afterward. What you experience after
hair transplant surgery depends somewhat on which procedure
you have, strip harvesting or FUE.
 Strip harvesting: As we explain in Chapter 12, single strip har-
vesting removes the donor tissue as a single strip or oval, and
then technicians divide it into smaller sections using a dis-
secting stereo-microscope to minimize damage to the follicles.
• Pain: When you leave the surgical office after a proce-
dure involving strip harvesting, you shouldn’t feel any
pain for about six hours. Doctors usually administer a
long-acting anesthetic when you leave that keeps you
pain-free for this period. When the anesthesia wears off,
you may have a dull ache in the area where the donor
strip was taken. About 95 percent of patients tolerate
this discomfort well, but you’ll get narcotics in pill form
to take home, and we strongly urge you to take one
along with a sleep aid when you go to sleep so that
you’re able to get some rest.
One out of every 200 to 300 patients experience consid-
erable pain on the night of surgery, probably resulting
from muscle spasms in the incision area. Your surgeon
should give you enough pain medication for this rare
occurrence, and you may want to put ice on the band-
aged incision area for pain relief. Also, you should be
given a travel-type neck pillow for properly positioning
the head at home. The pain will usually subside by
morning.
• Bandaging and bleeding: You’ll leave the office with 
a 1-inch band wrapped around your head, like a tennis
sweat band. This puts gentle pressure over the surgical
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
226

wound, which sometimes bleeds slightly under this
bandage. Some bleeding may occur because the long-
acting anesthetics contain adrenaline, which constricts
blood vessels. Generally, gentle pressure for about ten
minutes usually stops any bleeding, but if there’s any
excessive bleeding, be sure to call your doctor.
• Next day follow-up: Doctors generally like to see you
the next morning to administer the first hair wash,
which is done more aggressively than you may feel com-
fortable doing yourself. The goal is to clean off all blood
and scabs; many patients walk out after the hair wash
with minimal redness or indications that a hair trans-
plant was done. The post-surgical hair wash by the surgi-
cal staff isn’t a necessity, but if you do it yourself, make
sure you follow the washing instructions carefully. Your
doctor may supply a video to make the process easier
for you to understand and follow.
 Follicular unit extraction (FUE): In the FUE procedure, each
follicular unit is removed one at a time. The wounds are less
than 1mm each and they are not sutured as they are left open.
The wounds swell and often close on their own in a day or
two. If they crust, the scabs are very small. Bleeding is usually
minimal and healing is very fast, usually in less than a week. 
• Pain: The best part of an FUE is that there’s often no sig-
nificant pain after the surgery. Patients receive pain
medications, but these are rarely needed. The ache that
occurs in strip harvesting procedures is rarely present.
• Bandaging and bleeding: The wounds from where the
grafts were taken are left open and hidden under a base-
ball hat or bandana. Significant bleeding rarely occurs
because the wounds are so small. No bandages are used.
• Next day follow-up: Most patients have the option of
revisiting the office so that the surgical staff can perform
the first post-surgical hair wash, but it’s not a necessity
following this type of harvesting.
Possible Complications of 
Hair Transplant Surgery
It’s important to remember that a hair transplant is a surgical pro-
cedure, and any surgical procedure carries some risks. The risks
associated with a hair transplant are minimal, but they’re still
worth some thought. In this section, we explain the possible com-
plications and estimate their frequency.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 227

We base the following estimations on our own experiences in our
hair transplant practices over the years.
Anesthesia reactions
General anesthesia, in which you’re “put out,” is rarely used for hair
transplant surgery. General anesthetics bring risks that are almost
non-existent with local anesthetics, such as risk of death or stroke.
Local anesthetics with adrenaline may have effects on many of the
body’s organ systems, including the heart. Following are some of
these risks, along with the percentage of patients that typically
experience them:
 Allergic reaction (less than 1 percent of patients)
 Irregular heartbeat (less than 1 percent of patients)
 Heart attack within one month after surgery (less than 0.001
percent of patients)
 Particular sensitivity to epinephrine in patients who use heart
or blood pressure medications called beta-blockers (less than
1 percent of patients)
 Temporary light-headed episode as a nervous reaction to
injections, causing a drop in blood pressure and possible
fainting (less than 1 percent of patients)
This reaction is easily and relatively rapidly treated, most of
the time by lying the patient flat and elevating the legs.
Wound healing
Surgical wounds take time to heal. After surgery, any of the follow-
ing points may apply to your donor and recipient areas:
 Superficial crusting, pinkness, or redness of the recipient area
may occur (less than 5 percent of patients), but these effects
are usually temporary. In most patients, pinkness disappears
in a few days.
 Some area of skin around the suture edges may crust, taking
longer to heal (less than 5 percent of patients). A tight suture
may cause such crusting.
 A stretched, widened scar is possible, as is a thickened or
raised (hypertrophic) scar (less than 1 percent of patients).
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
228

Significant scarring is more likely to occur in people who have
a history of hypertrophic scars elsewhere on the body (less
than 25 percent of patients). True keloid scars (a tumorous
type of growth that grows out of the wound and extends
beyond the confines of the wound) are very rare in scalp inci-
sions (less than 0.001 percent of patients).
 In areas of scar tissue, grafts may grow poorly or not at all.
 Temporary swelling, discoloration, or bruising (less than 5
percent of patients)
 Formation of a cyst at a graft site (less than 5 percent of
patients). Most cysts will disappear on their own, a few may
spontaneously pop and drain themselves, and a few may have
to be lanced by a doctor or nurse. Cyst formation rarely
impacts hair growth. Cysts are formed as remnants of the hair
from a hair transplant remain in the surgical recipient site.
The existence of such remnants in the recipient sites is very
common but cyst formation is vary rare. Usually, any buried
remnants are ‘attacked’ by the body’s defenses and dissolved. 
 Ingrown or buried hairs (less than 5 percent of patients).
Ingrown hairs can be difficult to distinguish from buried
grafts. A graft that is placed too deeply in the scalp at the
recipient site, may sink into the fatty dermis and form a cyst.
Sometimes, the surgical staff may place one graft on top of
another and this will add to cyst formation as well. Both of
these problems may result from staff training inadequacies
and problems with in-office quality control processes. 
 Hematoma (localized blood clot) (less than 1 percent)
Pain
As the anesthesia wears off, if you had a strip harvesting proce-
dure (see Chapter 12 for an explanation), you’ll experience a throb-
bing pain on the back of the scalp, but this can be managed with
oral prescription pain medications such as Vicodin or Endocet.
Some patients rely on these medications for the first few nights so
that they can rest their heads in a comfortable position and sleep.
During the day, most patients use over-the-counter pain relievers.
The pain shouldn’t disrupt your normal daily functions; most
patients are able to return to their normal work activity in two to
three days following hair transplant surgery.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 229

Some patients experience pain from the sutures or staples used to
close their wounds. Staples are more uncomfortable than sutures
but may produce better long-term wound healing. When the sta-
ples or sutures are removed (10 to 20 days after surgery, depend-
ing on the doctor’s preference), most of the related pain goes away.
A very small percentage of patients (less than 2 percent) have
some discomfort in the wound for weeks or months after the sur-
gery, but this discomfort usually subsides over time.
Numbness
Numbness of the scalp may occur due to necessary cutting of fine
nerve fibers in the skin (less than 30 percent of patients). This is
expected to gradually disappear over several months, but it’s pos-
sible that all the sensation may not return (less than 1 percent of
patients). This is the consequence of strip harvesting and although
it can happen with follicular unit extraction harvesting, it is far
more rare. 
In extremely rare circumstances, major sensory nerve injury may
occur, resulting in long-term or possibly permanent numbness
and/or pain in the scalp (less than 0.001 percent of patients).
Having more than one hair transplant procedure puts you at a
higher risk of severing a major sensory nerve, which can produce a
temporary or permanent sensory defect in the back of the head.
Your surgeon’s experience is paramount in avoiding this complica-
tion. The risk of such damage with strip harvesting although very
small, is greater than the same damage from FUE harvesting. 
Swelling
A small number of patients experience post-surgical swelling in the
forehead if their grafts were placed in the frontal area. In the past,
swelling was a real problem for almost every hair transplant proce-
dure, but the use of short-term, higher-dose steroids during and
after the surgery has made the problem rarely significant. Applying
ice packs or cold compresses to the forehead a few times a day
may help reduce swelling.
If swelling occurs, it usually appears on the third or fourth day
after surgery and lasts from one to two days at most. You shouldn’t
feel any pain with the swelling. Most people with swelling look ter-
rible but feel fine. Significant swelling occurs in a substantial
number of patients who do not use large dose steroids and less
than one out of 40 patients for those using steroids. When swelling
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
230

does occur, it ) usually drops down to the eyelids, possibly closing
one eye on the third or fourth day (less than 1% of patients).
Infection
Although infection in hair transplantation is rare (less than 1 per-
cent of patients), you’ll be given an antibiotic to reduce the possi-
bility of infection at the beginning of the surgery. Your doctor may
want you to use a special antibacterial soap the night before and
the morning of surgery to help protect against infection, but wash-
ing with a good detergent shampoo may be just as effective.
The symptoms of infection may include:
 Swelling
 Redness
 Tenderness or pus at the surgical site
 Fever or chills
If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your doctor
immediately.
Redness, swelling, and slight tenderness is to be expected for the
first few days after the procedure. If the redness, swelling, or ten-
derness increases after the second day, you should speak with the
doctor. Infection can occur at either the donor or the recipient site.
Rarely, one or more grafts may become infected within the first
two weeks following the surgery. Infected cysts in the recipient
area may appear weeks after the surgery; they look like white pim-
ples or redness around individual hairs. They may be associated
with a yellow-colored crust and may be tender. If soaked with a
warm compress, they usually drain a yellow fluid following the
soaking. If these should occur with any frequency, you should con-
tact the doctor’s office. Antibiotic treatment may be necessary if
they become infected, spread to other areas, or don’t respond to
warm compresses.
Almost everyone develops a few pimples in the recipient area at
approximately one month following the surgery. These are either
new hairs breaking through the skin or the old hair from the grafts
being expelled by the body. They occasionally can be confused with
a true infection, but pimples tend to resolve on their own in three
or four days. As individual pimples resolve, new ones may crop up.
You can treat them by applying a warm, moist washcloth at least
twice a day for 10 to 15 minutes at a time (you may find it conven-
ient to do this in the shower). If more than just a few pimples
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 231

develop at one time, or if the skin in a larger area becomes swollen,
red, tender, and hot, you must see your doctor to find out if you
have an infection and possibly get antibiotics if they’re necessary.
Ingrown hairs may cause a cyst to develop in the area of a graft.
The cyst can develop over a graft that was placed several months
earlier. Cysts appear as local swelling and redness, with or without
tenderness. These cysts can be easily treated in the doctor’s office.
Preventing Hair Loss Acceleration:
Shock Loss
The medical term for the very onerous-sounding shock loss is “efflu-
vium,” which literally means “shedding.” Patients who experience
shock loss usually notice it in the first one to four months after hair
transplant surgery. Most of the hairs lost from post-surgical shock
loss may never grow back, particularly in young balding men.
Hair loss after one to three months may be from a number of
causes, including acceleration of the genetic process. Post-surgical
hair loss in men is usually seen in the miniaturized hair, and it’s
possible that some healthy non-miniaturized hair will be shed, but
this should regrow. Rarely do patients shed hair from a prior trans-
plant; however, when this occurs, previously transplanted hair
that’s lost almost always grows back completely.
Rest assured there are things you and your doctor can do to mini-
mize the effects of post-op shedding. Talk with your doctor about
your risk for post-op shedding and ways you can reduce your
chances of experiencing it, including the following:
 Use medication: The drug finasteride 1 mg (which goes by the
name Propecia) appears to reverse, slow down, or halt the
miniaturization process (when hair is at the end of its lifespan
due to genetic balding) and is very effective at decreasing the
risk of shedding following a transplant in most men.
 Time the transplant properly: If you’re experiencing early
hair loss but with a significant amount of miniaturization, a
minimal hair transplant won’t compensate either for potential
shedding or for progression of the hair loss. The surgery will
have a negative impact in that you may develop hair that
appears thinner, or you may have more bald spots than before
the procedure, which reflects the miniaturized hairs that have
been lost.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
232

 Use a sufficient number of grafts to offset any reasonable
expected hair loss: Your doctor can perform a transplant of
sufficient size to more than compensate for some shedding.
It’s a fallacy that some doctors’ techniques are so impeccable that
they can avoid effluvium altogether. Of course, bad techniques and
rough handling maximize the risk of shedding, hair naturally sheds
when the scalp is stressed, and it’s stressed during a transplant
from the anesthetic mixture and the recipient site creation. Post-op
shedding can’t be totally prevented.
Having Surgery to Repair
Unsatisfactory Results
You have some important considerations to make when consider-
ing a repair surgery. Not all hair transplants end up with good
results. The major cosmetic problems were caused by the older
techniques used prior to the mid-1990s but poor techniques are
not uncommon today. Most of the poor results seen today are pri-
marily due to poorly planned or improperly executed hair restora-
tion surgery. Many of these problems are interrelated, and patients
needing repair work often have multiple problems to correct. Poor
hair transplant work can not always be repaired. 
Repairing many disastrous cases is a challenge, and you need to
keep in mind that your doctor may not be able to fix everything
that’s wrong. Partial improvement may still be a worthy endeavor
when repairs are needed.
Before repairing a prior transplant, it’s important to first establish
what aspects of the old transplant work bothers you most. For
this, you must clearly express your concerns and priorities.
Some deformities of the transplant that bother your surgeon may
be left untreated if they don’t necessarily bother you. Setting prior-
ities at the outset will help ensure maximum patient satisfaction.
Our most satisfied patients are those who walked around
deformed from the old type of transplant work prior to our work-
ing with them. Gaining their trust after years of suffering is a major
accomplishment by itself.
This section describes some potential problems that may have you
heading back to your surgeon for repairs.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 233

Grafts that are too large 
or look pluggy
Tens of thousands of patients who received the large graft hair
transplant technique prior to the early 1990s have the classic doll’s
head look that people think is what all hair transplants look like.
Thankfully, this pluggy look shouldn’t occur with today’s trans-
plant techniques.
Large plugs placed into a bald head contract in size. Assuming that
all the hair survives the transplant, the density of these grafts will
(theoretically) be higher than the normal density of the donor hair.
So when they’re placed into a bald area, they become very
detectable because of a pattern of excessive density within the
larger grafts and empty spaces between them.
Most patients who have a significant amount of balding don’t have
enough donor hair to both fill in the spaces between the plugs and
cover all the area that needs to have hair. As a result, the surgeon
is left with the dilemma of choosing between a pluggy look scat-
tered over a large area or an uneven look, with very high density
grafts in some areas and insufficient coverage in others. Often the
patient is left with both problems!
When hair is distributed properly in a hair restoration procedure,
the density shouldn’t exceed 50 percent of your original hair den-
sity. The average human scalp has at least a 100 percent visual
redundancy, which means that the eye can’t perceive hair loss
until it exceeds 50 percent of what was originally there. So there’s
no logical reason to restore more than 50 percent of the original
density, especially given that the balding patient has less total hair
available. Hair from the old plugs can be removed and redistrib-
uted according to this rule or, if available, more hair can be taken
from the permanent zone and distributed in and around the big
plugs to camouflage them.
The pluggy look may also be tied to less density in the grafts than
anticipated from the size of the harvested plug. Two of the most
common causes are hair loss from poor harvesting techniques and
hair loss caused by a phenomenon called doughnutting. In dough-
nutting, the centers of grafts get insufficient oxygen following
transplantation and so the follicles in the central portion of the
grafts failed to survive. When part of the hairs around the circle
also died, a crescent moon deformity results in hair growing only
in part of the periphery of the grafts.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
234

Grafts generally placed without great precision often pit, creating a
deep hole in the scalp with hair growing out of it, or are raised
above the scalp horizon creating some cobblestoning of the skin.
Before better techniques were developed and perfected, these
unattractive results were common. 
Hairline problems
If your hairline isn’t placed in the correct position, you won’t have
a natural look and are likely to seek another transplant to repair
your results. Hairline problems fall into one of four categories:
 Hairline too far forward: If the hairline is placed too low, it
may be impossible to fix. A common mistake of the inexperi-
enced hair restoration surgeon is to restore the hairline to the
adolescent rather than the normal adult position.
Unfortunately, this also occurs when the doctor is anxious to
get the patient started with surgery rather than embarking on
a more conservative (and more appropriate) non-surgical
treatment. A low frontal hairline not only distorts your facial
proportions, but also it sets expectations that are unsustain-
able if the balding progresses. A low hairline also leaves the
restoration looking unnatural and unbalanced as you age.
 Hairline too high: A high hairline looks abnormal, even if the
grafts are follicular unit grafts with single hairs in the front.
Locating a restored hairline requires artistry, and placing a
frontal hairline too high is the most common mistake of the
hair restoration surgeon.
 Hairline too broad: Although the adolescent hairline hugs the
upper brow crease, the position of the normal adult male hair-
line is approximately one fingerbreadth higher (1.5 cm above
the upper brow crease at the midline).
 Hair pointing in the wrong direction: Your own hair direc-
tion must be followed exactly for any hope of the transplant
looking natural. The only exception is the occasional swirl at
the frontal hairline that most likely won’t be permanent.
The hair also must be placed pointing forward, toward the hori-
zon in the front and slowly angled upward as it progresses
back. Too many surgeons place the hair in a radial configura-
tion, like the spokes of a bicycle, which is a most unnatural hair
direction that never quite looks right. As hair approaches the
crown, a swirl is appropriate to allow for changing directions.
The hair also shouldn’t be transplanted perpendicular to the
scalp. Although patients are often unaware of the problem,
this looks distinctly unnatural. In a properly performed hair
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 235

transplant, the hair is transplanted pointing forward and then
when the hair is groomed to the side or back, the hair is bent,
showing the curve of the hair shaft rather than the base.
Unrealistic area of 
attempted coverage
Hair is a limited resource, so distributing it properly is critical. In
the hands of an ethical doctor, there’s no such thing as a preven-
tive hair transplant. Areas where your hair still appears normal
should not receive grafts. Many doctors transplant behind the tar-
geted bald area in order to push their fees higher, but hair trans-
plants placed in normal hair may do damage to that hair and, in
many men, will accelerate the hair loss.
On the other hand, the first areas to bald — the crown and frontal
hairline — should be transplanted cautiously, with an adequate
amount of hair always reserved for future use. Critical areas such
as the forelock and the area behind it will eventually require trans-
plants. If your donor reserves are limited due to poor scalp laxity,
low donor density, fine hair shaft diameter, or a host of other rea-
sons, transplanting hair in other less critical areas should be post-
poned or avoided entirely.
A pattern that resembles two horns and a tail may result when doc-
tors are too aggressive in transplanting the frontal hairline and
crown in a young person. This can become a cosmetic nightmare
for the patient if he experiences further balding and these regions
can’t be connected due to inadequate donor reserves.
Ridging
Ridging doesn’t occur with the modern follicular unit transplant,
but it’s a well-known abnormality of the older minigraft and larger
graft techniques. Ridging is essentially an area of heaped up skin at
the point where the plugs were placed into the frontal scalp. This
extra tissue makes the transplanted area elevated to the degree
that you can see a ridge in the scalp separating the forehead from
the area behind. In some patients, ridging is made worse by a reac-
tion of the surrounding tissue in response to the transplanted
grafts. This phenomenon called hyperfibrotic scarring accentuates
the abnormal contour of the transplanted area. Hyperfibrotic
changes are rarely seen with very small grafts and haven’t been
reported with follicular unit transplantation (FUT). (We explain
FUT in Chapter 12.)
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
236

Scarring
Scarring occurs 100 percent of the time after hair transplant sur-
gery, but if it can’t be seen or doesn’t impact hair growth, it’s not a
problem. Scarring can occur in either the donor or the recipient
areas. Donor area scarring is pretty much a given in patients
whose hair is harvested by the strip harvesting technique, but it
may be minimized by certain surgical techniques that can make
them almost undetectable in most patients. However, keep in mind
that some patients will always scar more than others. Scarring in
the recipient area is very rare with modern techniques.
Having a scar removed later may result in another scar in the same
place, although specialized surgical techniques may make cos-
metic improvements. The degree of scarring after a first surgery
where the wound measures more than 3 millimeters occurs in
about 5 percent of patients. After a second surgery, this risk dou-
bles. Scars of this size generally can’t be seen if the hair length in
the back of the head is 1⁄3 inch or so.
Although the major effect of removing hair from the donor area is
decreasing the amount of available hair for use elsewhere, when
scarring is severe, the scar itself may become a cosmetic problem.
This is most likely to occur when the scar is placed too high (in the
non-permanent zone), is placed too low (near the nape of the neck
or over the ear), is excessively wide in any location, or is raised
and results in a hypertrophic scar or a keloid.
Transplanting hair into areas with severe scarring can cause graft
elevation or depression, loss of grafts after the surgery, and poor
hair growth. Mild scarring may result in subtle textural and visual
irregularities in the skin around the grafts, distort the hair direc-
tion, and cause a change in quality of the hair shaft, all reducing
the chance of a cosmetically satisfactory result.
Laser hair transplantation, more aptly termed laser site creation,
represents the epitome of purposeless scarring. The laser is noth-
ing more than a marketing gimmick; it’s basically a glorified punch
that creates recipient holes or slits in the scalp by removing
(vaporizing) tissue. Regardless of how little damage is done to sur-
rounding tissue, the recipient tissue directly under the beam is
totally destroyed. (The laser has the additional disadvantages of
increased set-up time, greater cost, and potential eye hazards.)
Laser operators lack the precise tactile and visual guidance to
adjust for depth and angle when making sites on a curved scalp.
Most important, the laser destroys tissue, produces third-degree
burns, and unnecessarily increases the recipient wound size.
Chapter 13: Hair Transplant Surgery 237

Hair wastage
Careful surgery and a good surgical team using modern microscop-
ically controlled harvesting techniques produce minimal wastage.
If your doctors don’t use microscopes, the wastage can be 20 to 40
percent of the total hair removed. If your surgeon uses a multi-
bladed knife, the hair kill rate may be as high as 50 percent.
Wastage of donor hair from poor techniques leaves you with lim-
ited hair for future hair transplant surgeries. Hair wastage may be a
result of
 Poor graft harvesting and dissection
 Improper graft storage and handling
 Keeping the grafts out of the body too long
 Packing the transplanted grafts too closely in the scalp
 Poor preoperative preparation
 Inadequate postoperative care
Literally every step of a poorly executed transplant may deplete
your donor supply, and all the hair that’s lost is lost forever.
An interesting paradox occurs with the old punch-graft technique.
When the procedure is done well, most of the donor hair is cap-
tured in each punch, but the growth of the grafts appears pluggy,
which is a primary complaint from patients. When the procedure is
performed poorly, more of the harvested follicles are cut and dam-
aged. Transplanting these grafts decreases the pluggy look and
contributes to a softer, more natural look, which initially makes
patients happy. However, the poor growth is evidence that there
will be problems with hair supply in the future and, ultimately, a
worse cosmetic result.

Caring for Your Hair 
after Surgery
In This Chapter

 Understanding possible complications
 Deciding when (and if) to do it again
G
oing home after your hair transplant can be nerve-wracking:
What if you do something to destroy your expensive new
hair? Relax. Caring for transplanted hair isn’t that complicated. In
this chapter, we tell you what to do and signs to look for in case
problems do occur.
Homeward Bound with 
a New Head of Hair
Postoperative care for hair transplant surgery is minimal; your
doctor will explain most of the key points in writing. The most
important thing is to keep your hair and scalp clean and free of
crusting.
The hair grafts you received should be stable after one day and
should be fixed into your scalp, becoming relatively permanent in
the few days following the surgery.
You may notice a small amount of blood from the donor or recipient
area after the first day. Just apply direct pressure with clean gauze
(which your doctor should provide you with) or a clean towel until
it stops. If it doesn’t stop with simple pressure, call your doctor.

By the end of the first week you should be back to your old routine,
going about your day-to-day activities as if you never had the sur-
gery. If you have enough hair to cover the transplanted area, styling
alone may hide the grafts. From this point forward, it’s a hair-raising
waiting game, as it will take three to six months to see new hairs
coming through and about eight to nine months to see 80 to 90 per-
cent of the hair grow to styling length of two to three inches or so.
Recovering after anesthesia
A hair transplant is performed under local anesthesia, just like the
dentist uses to fill cavities. Local anesthesia is often supplemented
by some form of sedation to keep you relaxed during the surgery.
The use of sedatives is a good practice because, like a long air-
plane ride, sitting in a chair can be difficult for a typical six hour
hair transplant surgery.
After your surgery, you won’t need to go to a recovery room, but
can stand upright and walk out of the office. The effects of the
sedatives will last for much of the day after you leave the office, so
driving yourself home is out of the question. You need a driver for
the rest of the surgery day.
When you’re ready to leave the office, a nerve block is put into the
scalp; this should keep you comfortable for between four to six
hours, after which some feeling and possible discomfort occur. The
greatest amount of discomfort occurs the first night after the surgery. 
The fear of pain reflects the fear of the unknown. If there’s pain, it
usually is most intense the first night after the surgery. Your doctor
should provide you with medications that help you manage any
pain you have. 
Keeping your head crust-free
Some patients are afraid to even touch their grafts after a trans-
plant surgery for fear that they may dislodge or damage their
investment. But key to good post operative care is keeping the area
clean, and that involves some touching.
If your surgeon uses small needle holes for the recipient sites,
crusting is minimized and the wounds hold on to the grafts by
mechanical means. If crusting or small scabs appear after a few
days and persist, this may reflect poor washing techniques, recur-
ring crusting can be minimized by good scalp washing. 
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
240 Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 

Most of the crusting can be removed in the first two days with 
diligent washing techniques. Here are some of the key points to
remember:
 Never rub the transplanted area. 
 Shampoo once or twice daily. The use of a sponge filled with
water mixed with shampoo should be used on the grafted
area. The sponge is rolled over the grafts. This rolling motion
squeezes the soapy shampoo onto the recipient area. Ask
your surgeon for a surgical scrub brush that has no soap in it
as this sponge is ideal for washing the grafted areas. 
Never go over the grafts with a back and forth motion as this
may pull out the grafts. A back and forth or side to side motion
is safe to use on the donor area as there are no grafts there.
 Washing the donor area can be done more forcefully, remov-
ing all blood from the scalp, the first day after surgery. Once
all the blood is washed off, the area should stay clean. A back
and forth or side to side motion is safe to use on the donor
area as there are no grafts there
 Don’t spray water from the shower directly on your head to
rinse off the shampoo. Put your hand between the shower and
your head and let the water run off your hand until all of the
shampoo is off. Pat dry with a clean towel. 
 If the grafts are wet for too long, they may swell and look like
they’re rising above the skin surface. This will look like little
white bumps. This isn’t dangerous, but indicates that you’re
soaking too long. As soon as you dry your scalp, these ‘raised
bumps’ will disappear as the grafts settle down and the
swelling goes away. 
 If the crusts appear larger than the grafts because of bleeding
that may have occurred the first night, try to get these crusts
off by rolling a moist cotton swab over the crust. Don’t wipe
it, just roll it, as the cotton fragments will gently pull pieces of
the crust off. You need to be very gentle, so repeat the
process over and over again until the crusts disappear. You
don’t want to force any of the grafts out. 
 The grafts are usually securely locked in place by the fifth day
if the areas has been kept crust free. If the crusts last longer
than five days, it means that you haven’t washed vigorously
enough. Vigorously pulling or scrubbing crusts that remain
after five days can cause the crusts to pull the grafts out. 
Chapter 14: Caring for Your Hair after Surgery 241

The rule of thumb we use is that grafts must be crust free to be
considered secure. Grafts can come out for up to 12 days after 
surgery if crusts are present and you scrub them or pick at them.
This is an important rule because patients are worried that they
will pull out the grafts by something that they do.
The photo on the left in Figure 14-1 was taken an hour after a hair
transplant surgery of 1500 grafts (note that there’s no crusting or
bleeding present, because the recipient site holes were very small).
The photo on the right was taken 11 days after the surgery. At no
time did the patient have scabs or crusting on the recipient area.
This is the typical post-operative appearance of our patient surger-
ies. This patient went to work on the second post operative day
without any detection by his colleagues because he managed the
washing properly.

11 days later (right). 
Hiding your head
It’s always nerve wracking walking into a crowd with a new look,
and it’s especially nerve wracking when you’re worried that every-
one is going to be whispering behind your back, “Did he or didn’t
he?” While it’s normal to be self conscious at first, there are ways
to detract attention from your head and to hide your surgery from
the curious and the nosy!
If you have enough hair to cover the transplanted area, styling alone
may hide the transplants. From this point forward, it’s a hair raising
waiting game, as it will take three to six months before you see new
hairs coming through, and about eight to nine months to see 80 to
90 percent of the hair growth to styling length of two to three inches
or so.
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
242

If you’re very bald and concerned that someone may notice your
transplant, try growing out your beard!  Don’t shave starting the
day prior to the transplant and let your beard take on a stubbly
look. The change to your face will divert eyes from your scalp;
even a very bald man can hide the transplant with this technique. 
For men with beards or mustaches, try shaving them off. This will
always produce comments about your new look and again will
divert attention from the top of your head! 
Keeping your hair long before surgery is very important because
long hair can be styled to hide all of the wounds on the back and
side of the head (where the donor was removed).
As the recipient graft site will initially feel like beard stubble and
will grow over the next day and thereafter, the short transplanted
hairs will hold all of the long hair that is combed over it in place
without hair spray. 
The beard-like recipient hairs will look like they’re-growing out for
the first two weeks or so and then they usually fall out. Don’t panic
at this! It doesn’t mean that you’ve lost these precious hairs, but
that the hair has entered its telogen (rest) cycle, which may last up
to five months before the hair begins to reappear. 
Limiting your amount of exercise
With regard to strip harvesting, you can play golf or tennis by the
second day after surgery (your swing may be off because of the pull
of the sutures or staples), or you can even run a marathon one
week later. The main concern with postoperative exercise is the
stress on the donor areas on the scalp from which grafts were
taken. For example, straining or stretching the back of the neck (e.g.
pull-ups or sit-ups) may lead to a wider scar and should be avoided.
It’s good to walk and exercise within a few days after a transplant.
Because the impact of exercise varies greatly from person to person,
we can’t make hard and fast recommendations; be sure to discuss
your particular concerns with your doctor.
With regard to FUE harvesting wounds, there are no exercise
restrictions after a week. (See Chapter 12 for more on the types of
hair plant surgeries.) The same washing techniques discussed
above, must be applied to the recipient area and the donor area
can be washed vigorously after the third day. The donor area, how-
ever, can be scrubbed vigorously after three or four days. 
Chapter 14: Caring for Your Hair after Surgery 243

Sutures or staples can be removed between 9 and 17 days after
surgery depending upon the surgeon’s assessment of your healing.
Staples tend to be more uncomfortable than sutures, but they may
produce better wound healing than sutures in the long run.
For strip harvesting wounds, exercises that don’t flex the neck or
put pressure on the back of the neck are usually okay. You may
resume swimming three weeks after your procedure, but you
shouldn’t soak the donor wound for a full month.
In general, exercises such as sit-ups (especially with your hands
clasped behind your head), squats, heavy weight-lifting, and bench
presses strain the back of the neck and should be avoided for at
least four weeks following surgery. If the back of the scalp feels
tight after four weeks, or if you have a tendency to heal with wide
scars, you should avoid these activities for three to six months.
For FUE harvested areas, you can resume swimming in one week
provided that the wounds are all closed by that time; there are no
restrictions for any other form of exercise.
The donor wound won’t regain its full strength from strip harvesting
for at least three to six months after the surgery, so use a reasonable
degree of caution during this period. Use good judgment, and call
your surgeon if you have questions.
Handling Complications
As with any surgery, hair transplantation can have complications
even past the normal postoperative period. This section reviews
some of the potential problems to be aware of following your surgery.
Post operative brow and 
facial swelling
With all head and scalp surgery, swelling is common. At times the
swelling can be very significant, causing an eyelid to swell shut.
When swelling appears, it usually occurs on the third or fourth day
and lasts only one or two days. 
Most post operative swelling can be eliminated with the judicious
use of large doses of steroids started the day of surgery and taken
over four to five days. The use of steroids, however, must be care-
fully weighed since certain medications or medical conditions may
prohibit their use, such as diabetes, which tends to be aggravated
with steroid use. 
Part V: Advanced Hair Loss Solutions 
244

Your surgeon will need to make the call on whether steroids are
worth the potential complications in your particular case in collab-
oration with your medical doctor.
Failure of transplanted hair to grow
As with all surgical procedures, results from hair transplants can’t
be guaranteed. It’s possible that some or all of the transplanted
hair may fail to grow (this occurs in less than one percent of
cases). Every effort will be made to give you the maximum yield
from your transplanted hair.
Alopecia Areata (AA), or spot baldness, can in rare cases exist in a
diffuse form that resembles genetic balding. The diffuse form of
this disease, when it occurs, is more frequent in women than in
men, and can be a cause of a transplant failure if your body’s
immune system attacks the hair follicles (<0.1 percent chance). AA
can be diagnosed by multiple biopsies. 
Failure of the transplants to grow can be caused by other factors
such as technical failures by the surgical team, due to inexperience
and/or sloppy surgical methods. We call this the H (human) factor.
As this surgery is a team effort, the team is only as good as its
weakest member. Inexperience in the surgical team is the most
probable cause of graft growth problems. 
On rare occasions, the grafts may not all grow, even though your
surgeon and the surgical team do everything perfectly. The hair
transplant industry has called this the X factor, which simply
means that there’s no identifiable cause for the problem. 
Clearly X factor is an additional set of factors beyond the patient’s
scalp condition or the surgical team. The chances of failure to grow
from X factors should be less than one percent in the hands of an
experienced surgical team. 
When hair fails to grow, it may be helpful to biopsy the scalp in the
areas where the failure occurred, but because this type of failure is so
unusual, biopsies are not recommended in advance of the transplant. 
Hair loss
Hair loss can occur at both the recipient site and the donor site.
For men, hair loss at the recipient site is related to genetic induced
miniaturization of the existing hair and minimized by taking finas-
teride (1 milligram daily). This drug is effective fairly quickly (in
the first 24 hours). 
Chapter 14: Caring for Your Hair after Surgery 245

Young men are at greater risk for post operative hair loss so a daily
dose of finasteride is important to prevent what is referred to as
shock loss or accelerated thinning secondary to the genetic balding
process. (The next section explains shock loss.) If you’re a man
under 35, planning hair transplant surgery, you should talk to your
doctor and begin taking finasteride at least two weeks prior to the
procedure. 
Men over age 35 have less chance of shock hair loss after a hair
transplant because their genetic hair loss has usually slowed by
that age.
When hair loss occurs in the recipient area in a young man with
genetic hair loss who has not been on finasteride, the loss may be
permanent. This type of loss usually occurs in the first six months
post surgery. When hair loss occurs in women in the recipient area,
the loss is rarely permanent, but it may take four to six months for
hair to regrow in the recipient area.
Hair loss can also occur around the donor area; this is most often
the result of a wound closure that’s too tight. When hair loss
occurs in the donor area, it usually starts at about ten days after
surgery and completes its course over the following six weeks.
When hair falls out in the donor area, it usually re-grows over the
ensuing four to eight months. The hair that is shocked is forced
into its sleep (telogen) phase, but will usually recover. 
Hair loss acceleration: Shock loss
While hair loss after transplant is always a shock, shock loss refers
to a specific type of post surgical hair loss. Turn to Chapter 13 for
more about shock loss, what it is, how often it occurs, and what
can be done about it. 
Surgery and the anesthesia associated with the surgery can stress
hair so that the hair might continue its loss on an accelerated time-
line. We see this in men and women (see Chapter 13).
Sun damage
After your transplant, you must protect your scalp from the damag-
ing rays of the sun, particularly for the first three months. Although
sun will not prevent the new transplanted hair from growing, it can
damage the healing process. Ultraviolet light damages newly formed
collagen. If you have a history of skin cancer or sun-damaged skin,
you should follow up regularly with your dermatologist.

It’s possible that significantly sun-damaged skin may hinder hair
growth because the blood vessels of the scalp can be damaged. 
Wear a hat to protect yourself in the sun. After the scabs or crusts
have fallen away, you can (and should) apply sunscreen to the scalp.
Doing It Again
If you feel that you need more hair, more fullness, you may want to
consider another surgical hair transplant. You should wait a mini-
mum of eight months after the previous procedure, when 80 to 90
percent of the transplants will have grown out. You need to see the
results of your transplant before making a decision to have another.
Ask yourself the following questions as you ponder a second surgery:
 Have you achieved your goals?
 Did the hair transplants cover the balding area you wanted to
cover?
 Is the hair full enough? 
 How did the wound heal? Is it detectable?
Many fairly bald patients or those with fine hair should expect to
have more than one procedure for the best results. Still, it’s possi-
ble that you’ll feel that you’ve achieved your goal in one session
and don’t feel that more hair will add value to your results. See
Chapter 13 for more.

Ten (or so) Myths 
about Hair Loss
In This Chapter
 Debunking myths about the causes of hair loss
 Revealing what doesn’t prevent hair loss 
B
ecause people are so attached to their hair (pun intended), a
number of myths have sprung up regarding hair — when and
why it goes gray, what causes baldness, and how baldness can be
prevented are just a few topics of focus. Wherever people are going
bald or worried about losing their hair, myths about hair abound.
This chapter turns an objective eye to hair myths so you can 
separate the serious from the silly when it comes to hair loss.
Hair Loss Comes from 
Your Mother’s Side
The idea that you inherit a baldness gene only from your mother’s
side of the family is a myth. The inheritance of common baldness
appears to be found on the autosomal — the non-sex-related —
chromosomes, which means that baldness can come from either
parent. Moreover, the baldness gene is a dominant gene, meaning
that you need only one gene on one chromosome to express the
balding trait, although multiple genes appear to influence the 
balding process.
You can get some insight into baldness by examining balding pat-
terns in your relatives. If you have an uncle, father, or grandfather
who’s bald or balding, find out when he started to lose his hair; it
may be an indication as to when you may go bald. Just don’t put all
the blame on Mom if you start to lose your hair. It’s not her fault!

Women also inherit the thinning or balding patterns found in their
families, but the patterns that are inherited are distinctly women’s
patterns, not men’s pattern. This suggests that the inheritance pat-
terns in women do not follow the inheritance patterns in men.
Women with hair loss or thinning will frequently report that they
take after their mom, grandmother (either side of the family),
sister, aunt, etc.
Wearing Hats Causes Hair Loss
More than a few people believe that hats are to blame for baldness
based on the idea that hats cut off air circulation to the scalp and
prevent the scalp from breathing. What they don’t know is that
hair follicles get oxygen from the bloodstream, not the air, so you
can’t suffocate your hair follicles just by wearing a hat. The base-
ball cap so often worn by men whose hair is thinning doesn’t cause
baldness — it hides baldness.
Hats that fit tightly on the head are another story. These hats may
cause thinning around the sides of the head where constant trac-
tion is applied to the hair. Hats worn all the time for cultural and
religious reasons (such as turbans and yarmulkes) may cause hair
loss, too. In rare cases, sports helmets have been known to cause
traction alopecia in athletes who wear their helmets too often, par-
ticularly if the helmet rubs repeatedly against an area of the scalp,
causing “traction.”
If You Don’t See Hair in the 
Drain, You Aren’t Balding
You don’t go bald because your hair is falling out; you go bald
because your normal, thick hair is gradually being replaced by
finer, thinner hair in a process called miniaturization. Yet people
who are sensitive to the prospect of going bald often obsessively
scrutinize the shower drain and the hairbrush for evidence of
impending baldness.
Most people lose about 100 hairs daily but grow another 100 hairs
daily to replace what’s lost. Some of the lost hairs wind up in your
shower drain or hairbrush, or they may just fall off as you go about
your normal activity, responding to whatever your environment
dishes out.
Part VI: Part of Tens 
252

Massive hair loss appearing in the shower drain should alarm you
(as should a trail that forms behind you as you walk down the
hall!), but insidious, progressive loss may be far more subtle. If 
progressive loss persists over time, you may lose far more hair
than you’ll ever see in the shower drain. This is particularly the
case with female hair loss.
Excessive Use of Hair Chemicals
and Hot Irons Kills Your Hair
Hair isn’t alive, so hair products or hot irons can’t “kill” hair,
although they may cause hair damage. As long as the damage
caused by hair products is limited to the hair and not the growing
hair follicles below the skin, hair above the skin may be lost from
breakage or damage, but it will re-grow from the follicles at a rate
of  1⁄2 inch per month.
Damaging hair follicles below the skin, however, can cause bald-
ness. When inexperienced people apply chemicals such as unsafe
dyes or relaxing agents to the hair and scalp, the caustic chemicals
may work their way into the growing part of the hair follicle and
damage or kill the hair follicle at its root. The longer powerful
chemicals stay on the scalp, the deeper they may penetrate into the
pores of the skin where the hair follicles are, resulting in permanent
hair loss or hair that may never look “healthy.”
Chapter 15: Ten (or so) Myths about Hair loss 253
Risking it all to cover up
Many of Dr. Rassman’s patients have lived underneath baseball caps for years,
never venturing outside without them. The best example is Sam, who was in the
shower when the 1994 Northridge earthquake hit in California. Sam never went out
without his baseball cap, but when his apartment started to shake, he put a towel
around his waist and ran out of the apartment without his baseball hat on. When he
reached the street half-naked, Sam realized his head was also naked and immedi-
ately ran into the shaking building to retrieve it. He returned to the street still wear-
ing only his towel — but he had his baseball cap!
Dr. Rassman’s office has many Open House events, and Sam comes to many of them
to share this story with the audience of prospective hair transplant candidates and
to show off his glorious hair. He never wears a baseball cap since finishing his trans-
plant reconstruction.

Applying dyes, chemicals, or hot irons (even hair rollers that are
too hot) can cause the hair to become fragile and break off. Hair
breakage and split ends are most common in people with long hair
because the hair is around for a longer amount of time before
being cut, so it’s more susceptible to damage from wind, drying,
and sunlight as well as chemicals such as relaxers and hair dyes.
Hair Loss Is Caused 
by Decreased Blood Flow
One hair loss myth says that standing on your head increases the
flow of blood to your scalp and thereby improves hair regrowth and
regeneration. Although the act may entertain the neighbors and give
you a unique look on life (albeit an upside-down one), specialists
agree that standing on your head has no impact whatsoever on hair
loss. Growing hair does require a significant amount of blood flow,
but after you lose hair, blood flow to your scalp decreases because,
well, you just don’t need it with no hair up there.
There’s a cause and effect issue here, but it’s important to remem-
ber that the hair loss occurs before the blood flow decreases.
Decreased blood flow to the scalp isn’t the cause of the hair loss but
rather the result of it. The absolute proof of this is that, when good
hair is placed into a bald scalp with decreased blood flow, the blood
flow returns when the hair starts growing. 
Magnets Increase Hair Growth
In the early days of electricity, magnetic devices were commonly
sold in local newspapers as a cure for hair loss. Magnetic therapy,
a kind of alternative medicine, holds that magnetic fields can yield
health benefits by improving blood flow. Backers of the therapy
claim that it can be used to treat arthritic joints, circulation prob-
lems, and erectile dysfunction.
Over the years, we’ve been asked many times whether magnets
can increase hair growth. The answer is a definitive “no.” Even if
magnetic fields do affect blood flow — and that’s a dubious propo-
sition — increasing blood flow to the scalp doesn’t prevent hair
loss or regenerate hair.

Brushing Your Hair Is 
Better Than Combing It
When you tug and pull a comb or brush through the tangles and
knots in your hair, you may pull out a few hairs, but they’ll grow
back because brushing and combing healthy hair doesn’t disturb
the hair follicles below the skin surface. Brushing the hair isn’t nec-
essarily better than combing because the real issue is how you
brush or comb the particular kind of hair you have. Tugging on
knotted hair isn’t good even for healthy hair, but hair that has
already started being miniaturized is more susceptible to loss from
any kind of rough treatment, including that with a comb or brush.
You’re less likely to damage your hair using a wide-tooth plastic
comb or a brush as opposed to a metal comb or one with finer,
tighter teeth; these combs tend to be rougher and more traumatic
to the hair shaft. When brushing or combing, direct your motion in
the direction of hair growth so that the hair shaft (the grain of the
hair) is in line with your brushstrokes.
Cutting or Shaving Your Hair 
Make It Grow Back Thicker
Getting frequent haircuts doesn’t make your hair grow more thickly,
but it’s easy to see how this particular myth came about. When hair
is cut short, it gets scratchy like sandpaper, and when you run your
fingers through this scratchy hair, it seems thicker than it did
before. But it’s not thicker — it’s just shorter. Hair grows on average
at a rate of a 1⁄2 inch per month. It grows at that rate whether you
cut it daily or get a haircut only during leap years on February 29.
Hair Loss Is Caused 
by Clogged Pores
Many dishonest people claim that clogged pores are the cause of
hair loss. Some folks build huge businesses around massaging hair
and “treating” the clogged hair follicles to allow the hair to come
through the skin. From my experience, people who sell such serv-
ices command a healthy price between $200 and 500 per month.
Chapter 15: Ten (or so) Myths about Hair loss 255

If common baldness were simply due to clogged pores, you
wouldn’t need anything more than rigorous shampooing to main-
tain a full head of hair. But I’m sure you’ve seen men and women
who don’t wash their hair often but who don’t seem to have a
problem with balding.
Men in particular buy into this clogged pore myth because they feel
helpless at watching their hair fall out; when someone tells them that
frequent massage and the use of special lotions will free up these
clogged pores, they buy into it hook, line, and sinker. Of course, they
do get some reward because the head massage feels great. 
Frequent Shampooing 
Causes Hair to Fall Out
When you notice your hair starting to thin, you may blame your
shampoo. You notice shed hair in the bathtub or shower and
decide to shampoo less often to keep from losing hair. As a result,
hair that would normally come out in the bath or shower builds up
on the scalp. With the next shampoo, you see even more hair loss,
confirming your original suspicion that shampooing causes bald-
ness. Thus another hair myth gains footing.
Hereditary baldness isn’t caused by hair falling out but by normal
hair gradually being replaced by finer, thinner hair. Shampoo has
nothing to do with baldness.
Hair Loss Stops When 
You Get Older
This myth is partly true because hair loss slows down in men as
they age. Usually, men over the age of 60 see only marginal loss, if
they have any hair loss at all. For women, the exact opposite is
true: with age and the loss of the protective hormone estrogen,
women with genetic hair loss find that the hair loss process that
starts during menopause gets progressively worse as they age.

Ten Pros and Cons of Non-
Surgical Hair Replacement
In This Chapter
 Appreciating the advantages of hair replacement systems
 Weighing the disadvantages of hair systems
U
sing a so-called “hair system” (discussed in full detail in
Chapters 6 and 7) isn’t for everyone, but considering that
non-surgical hair replacement is a multibillion dollar industry, it’s
clearly the right decision for many. Despite the common stigma
and jokes about “rugs” or “mops,” a good hair system isn’t easy to
detect, can be easy to use, and can help cover extensive hair loss
problems and other scalp deformities. A good hair system also can
be a good solution for temporary hair loss. As with most things in
life, there are pros and cons to hair replacement systems. In this
chapter, we weigh them out for you.
The Pros of Hair 
Replacement Systems
Hair systems have definite advantages to some people in some sit-
uations. In this section, we share three of the most common rea-
sons that people get hair replacement systems.
The immediate change
One great thing about a hair replacement system is that the results
are instantaneous. Put it on your head, and you can see exactly what
you’ll look like a week, a year, or ten years from now. You don’t have
to wait for a wig to grow, or worry that it might not “take” like a hair
transplant or a medical therapy. Hair systems are sure things.

You can buy hair replacement systems in multiples, which means you
can change your look easily and have a spare if something should
happen to one system.
Quick solutions to mask 
medical problems
With some patients, such as men who have very advanced hair
loss where their supply of donor hair is inadequate, or people with
various forms of autoimmune diseases (see Chapter 5), surgical
restoration or other hair replacement alternatives are impossible.
In these cases, hair systems can be an excellent choice.
Men and women who have temporary hair loss resulting from
chemotherapy often opt to wear wigs. In diseases such as alopecia
totalis, which causes total loss of hair on the head, only a full helmet-
type wig works. Wigs are also an excellent cosmetic solution if you
have extensive patchy alopecia areata, an autoimmune condition
that results in partial, often temporary hair loss.
Using a hair system as a temporary solution for a temporary problem
is invaluable. If you need to wear it for an extended period of time,
you can attach a wig with tape or glue in the same manner as a
smaller hair system. “Vacuum-fit” attachment devices designed
especially for full scalp, helmet-fitting wigs offer the benefit of a
very secure but not a very comfortable fit (as these vacuum hair
systems are a helmet in size, they are equipped with a suction
device to hold the helmet in place.) Keep in mind, though, that
many of these helmet type hair systems don’t “breathe” and can be
hot, particularly in the summer.
Initially lower cost
We can’t argue that over a lifetime, replacing, repairing, washing,
and otherwise fooling around with wigs can be more expensive
than having a hair transplant, but the initial cost is still lower.
Many people opt for wigs instead of transplants, accepting the
long-term costs, for any or all of the following reasons:
 They can’t afford the high initial cost of a hair transplant. For
many people, a few thousand dollars a year is easier to swal-
low than tens of thousands all at once.
 They’re scared to death at the thought of having surgery.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
258

 They anticipate a day when they won’t wear a hair system.
After ten years or so, or when a person ages to a point where
vanity isn’t such a big issue, he or she (more commonly “he”)
may decide it’s time to go “au natural.”
The Cons of Hair 
Replacement Systems
Using a hair system isn’t without its disadvantages. You may find
that these negatives far outweigh the positives, or you may find
that the opposite is true for you. Regardless, there’s no fault in a
well-informed decision, so this section lays the disadvantages of
hair systems on the line.
Living with the fear of discovery
There’s great fear among hair system users that the system may be
too obvious and detected. Although there’s no such thing as a
completely detection-free and worry-free hair system, high quality
ones can look very real. But they’re often very expensive and require
careful and constant upkeep. Because most people feel that a hair
system is a cover-up, you must be ever aware of the status of your
hair system: where it’s located on the head, how firmly the attach-
ment is, and how well-groomed it is.
Depending on the size and shape of your hair replacement system,
you may need to have it styled just like your own hair in order to
make sure it blends in and goes undetected. Although the piece
won’t grow, the hair around and beneath it will, so you must have
your natural hair cut frequently to match the length of the hair
system. Blending the two maximizes the natural look of your whole
head of hair. The thickness of your hair and the thickness of the hair
of the hair system should also be similar (although they rarely are).
If your hair system covers a substantial portion of your head, you
must decide what to do with the normal hair under the hair system
(if you have some). If you decide to shave it, you can attach the
system with glues or tapes. If you keep your normal hair long, clips
or weaves may be the best way to attach the system.
What makes a hair system detectable? One of the most common
errors in selecting a hair system is ignoring the frontal hair line.
People see the frontal view first, so it’s where you’re most vulnera-
ble. With natural hair, the frontal hairs create a delicate transition
Chapter 16: Ten Pros and Cons of Non-Surgical Hair Replacement 259

zone from the bald forehead to the thick hair behind it, usually
covering a distance of about 1⁄2 inch. The challenge with a hair
system is recreating that zone with fine, skin-matched mesh exten-
sion with fine hairs in front of the thicker hair of the hair system.
The mesh drives up the cost considerably, so many people just
accept the hair system without a frontal extension.
One way to blend the frontal view without a fine mesh extension is
to buy a hair system that has internal cover for the frontal hairline
and use styling tricks, such as a side-combed style shifted forward,
to hide the actual hairline.
Chasing the fly-away wig
When you wear a hair system, by far your worst nightmare is that a
sudden wind may sneak up behind you and blow the hair right off
of your head (we call this the “fly-away wig”). More commonly, the
attachment moves because it comes loose as a result of hair
growth under the bonding system where the system is physically
attached. The bonding can become loose as the outer layer of skin
starts to slough, or it may just start to break down.
Frequent upkeep takes the stress out of the problem of “keeping
your hair on.” Pay close attention to the status of your hair system
and the security of the bonding tapes or glues, and tend to the hair
growth below the hair system.
Disguising the odor
Bacteria grow on the exfoliated skin and sebum (body oils) build
up under hair replacement systems — an unpleasant thought, we
know. It’s only a matter of time until the smell of this bacterial
growth begins to radiate from around your head. Regular hygiene
is difficult with a hair system that has a more permanent type of
attachment than one you can remove nightly.
You can combat bad smells by frequently washing your hair
system. If you have two hair systems, you can remove one and
replace it with the other while you wash and dry the first.
However, washing a hair system causes progressive damage — the
more it’s washed, the quicker it wears out. Most attachment tech-
niques are designed to allow you to loosen one edge of the system
to wash under it, and then reattach the edge. Wearers who choose
to have their pieces glued on for a month or longer must take great
care to wash under them regularly.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
260

Our best advice is to assume the hair system has a smell and to
react accordingly with regular washing. Pouring a bottle of cologne
over your head is not a viable substitute!
Maintaining a no-touch zone
This is a law that most hair system wearers live by. Most hair
system wearers fear detection when there’s the slightest intimacy
or physical touching above the neck. Hugging a relative or date
without letting them touch your head is awkward; it produces a no-
touch zone that hinders intimacy with your nearest and dearest.
Adjusting to gray
When your natural hair starts to turn gray or salt and pepper, your
must either alter or replace your hair system to blend in with the
changes, or dye your natural hair to match the hair system. Replacing
the hair system with gray or salt and pepper hair isn’t a big prob-
lem because a system usually wears out in two to three years and
must be replaced anyway.
If you decide to alter the hair system you have, you can have some
gray hair put in when repairing the mesh and putting more hair into
the hair system; this method allows you to gradually adjust to gray.
But this gradual alteration can be expensive. The key is to keep the
hair system naturally color-matched to your existing hair.
As most wearers own between two and four units, each must be
color-matched as they’re changed and washed, and that matching
adds up financially.
Continuing regular haircuts
If you aren’t completely bald, you can’t just cover up what’s left of
your natural hair and forget about it. Hair beneath and around a
hair system continues to grow, needs to be washed, and may need
to be colored if you’re trying to maintain your natural hair color.
One do-it-yourself solution is to shave your head, but that’s not
practical for most women or for men who want to use the hair they
have left to augment or attach the hair system. (We discuss differ-
ent types of attachments in Chapter 6.)
Chapter 16: Ten Pros and Cons of Non-Surgical Hair Replacement 261

Eating into your expense account
People assume that hair systems are the least expensive alterna-
tive to hair loss. But many people find that the long-term costs
involved with upkeep and replacement are a major disadvantage
that they didn’t plan for financially.
You may be able to find hair systems sold in mail-order catalogues
or over the Internet for a few hundred dollars, but a good quality
system can cost between $1,000 and $5,000. (Remember, the better
quality the system, the harder it is to detect.) It’s common to buy
one or more identical spares at the same time so that you can wear
one while the other gets cleaned or repaired as necessary.
Continued maintenance costs, replacements costs as your hair
thins, changes in texture and color, and the like can all become
quite expensive. (See Chapter 6 for a typical budget from one of
our patients.) 
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
262
You can look, but you better not touch
We know of a patient who believed (but wasn’t positive) that his long-term girlfriend
didn’t know about his hair system, and he was obsessed with keeping his no-touch
zone intact to guarantee that any suspicions she may have had weren’t confirmed.
When she tried to touch his hair in intimate situations, he managed to keep her from
it. However, he couldn’t prevent a wind from coming up and blowing off his hair-
piece as he and his girlfriend were walking on the Las Vegas strip.
When the patient’s hair system blew off, he ran after it and ducked into a nearby
store, leaving his girlfriend on the street. He reattached the hair system in the store
bathroom and then took the next flight to Los Angeles for an emergency hair trans-
plant, sending his girlfriend back home to Washington, D.C., by herself. Months later,
he called us from home to say that he’d taken off his hairpiece and finally was going
to experiment to see if his girlfriend could tell the difference. Minutes later, he called
again to say that she’d immediately gone for his hair when he left his guard down,
and although he was sick with fear, he allowed her to run her fingers through his
hair. She admitted to suspecting that he had a hair system and was happy to feel his
lovely, soft hair.
This patient told us that this was one of the most suspenseful and exciting experi-
ences he’d had in years, and he felt that the decision to have a hair transplant was
worth every penny. His no-touch zone was gone in an instant, and that feeling of
his girlfriend running her fingers through his hair was indescribable. They were mar-
ried within a year of his hair growth!

eciding whether a hair transplant is right for you is difficult.
You may not only be dealing with your own feelings about it
but also those of your family and friends. In this chapter, we give
you ten good reasons why a hair transplant may be just what the
doctor ordered for you.
Bald Isn’t Making 
You Feel Beautiful 
Some people hesitate to get a hair transplant because they think
doing so makes them vain. But let’s face it: Everyone wants to feel
good about their appearance and goes to some lengths to feel
better about how they look. Being told by family members, as some
of my patients have been, that “being bald was good enough for
Grandpa and should be good enough for you,” isn’t a good reason
to dismiss a hair transplant if you think it’s what’s best for you.
A hair transplant isn’t a sign of weakness or insecurity. In fact, a
number of powerful, successful men have had hair transplants. For
example, the president of South Korea, Lee Myung Bak, is widely
rumored to have had a hair transplant, and former Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
are among those who have taken steps to reclaim their hair.

And it’s also true that many bald men are considered very attrac-
tive. Among them are actors Taye Diggs, Omar Epps, and Bruce
Willis. But a surprising number of people have oddly shaped heads
or scars, warts, lumps, or bumps on their heads that they would
prefer cover with hair. It’s a wonderful form of makeup to make
your head look more like everyone else’s.
You’d Like a More 
Symmetrical Face
Here’s something you probably never knew (unless you were an art
major in college): A so-called perfect face follows the rule of sym-
metry, which states that symmetrical portions of facial features
equal attractiveness. In other words, a face that can be divided into
equal thirds is an attractive face. Most people’s faces don’t conform
exactly to the rule of thirds ( 1⁄3 from chin to nose, 1⁄3 from nose to
the bridge between the eyes, and 1⁄3 from the bridge between the
eyes to the hairline). Men rarely have those exact proportions, but
in today’s society, a handsome male face typically has a hairline
that, in its distance from hollow at the upper point where your nose
meets your forehead to the start of the hair, is equal to or less than
the distance between the nose and the chin, never longer.
We measure these elements of the face on every patient coming
through our office when we design a replacement hairline. The
adult male hairline, which we call the mature hairline, has an equal
distance between the chin to nose tip and the gully of the nose
between the eyes to hairline. So that’s the distance we aim to
create in a mature male hairline reconstruction.
Our 100-percent rule for determining hairline location is based on
forehead creases. Look in the mirror and lift your eyebrows as high
as you can. You see wrinkles in the forehead that are created by a
muscle that lies beneath the skin; hair never grows on the skin on
top of this muscle (below that crease). In children and women, the
location of the hairline is at the highest wrinkle. The mature male
hairline sits 2⁄3 inch above the highest wrinkle. This space reflects
the normal recession of the hairline in the non-balding male; if the
hairline rises further than 2⁄3 inch, it’s an indication of early genetic
recession and the beginning of patterned balding.
If you look in the mirror and lift your eyebrows, the highest crease
is where the hairline resided when a boy was 10 years old. If he
wrinkled his brow, the hairline would hug his lower drawn-in hair-
line. The second line is the mature hairline that formed between
ages 19 to 29. The shaded area above the second line shows hairline
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
264

recession forming a pattern that reflects early balding. If this man
lifted his eyebrows and creased his brow, the highest crease would
appear at the point where the lowest hairline shows.
When your hairline creeps upward, the proportions of your face
change. Bringing your hair back down to where it belongs can keep
your facial proportions in their proper balance, which is critical for
a non-balding man’s hairline reconstruction.
You Don’t Want People 
Talking to Your Forehead
A common complaint of people with rising hairlines is that when
they meet someone, the other person’s eyes immediately look
north. Lack of direct eye-to-eye contact is very disconcerting for
even the most secure of people. A nice hairline avoids this uncom-
fortable problem by keeping the face framed and companions’ eyes
from wandering up.
Even with significant thinning on the top of your head or crown,
your appearance doesn’t really change until the hairline starts to
go and you lose the upper aspect of the frame to your face.
Framing is an important facet in art. For example, what good is a
Picasso painting worth millions if it’s not mounted and framed
properly? A high-quality frame can make even an average Joe’s
painting look like expensive art. A face with a well-placed hairline
brings out the best in facial features. When there’s no upper hair-
line, the forehead seems to go on forever!
When a hair transplant is done and the hairline isn’t placed in the
proper position, the forehead remains wide. We’ve seen skilled hair
transplants in which the doctor has placed the hairline higher than
where we define the mature male hairline. Even if the grafts aren’t
detectable, locating the hairline higher than where it belongs still
draws the eye to the abnormally long forehead.
You Don’t Want the Lifetime 
Cost of a Hair System
If you’re trying to solve your hair problem and save money, you
may think that it’s cheaper to buy a toupee or other hair system
rather than have a hair transplant. A hair system (toupee or wigs;
see Chapters 6 and 7 for a full discussion of both) can seem 
Chapter 17: Ten Reasons to Consider a Hair Transplant 265

inexpensive at first, but with the upkeep and maintenance, the life-
time expense can far surpass that of any hair transplant surgery.
Good quality hair systems range from $1,000 to $5,000 per year. We
know of one typical patient who spent over $16,000 in the course
of five years to purchase a hair system and maintain it! And the
next five years will cost him the same amount without adjusting to
inflation. Although a hair transplant is a one-time investment often
comparable to or less than the five-year cost of a wig, a wig or a
toupee needs costly maintenance — not such a great deal for you.
Hair transplants are the better deal on the basis of just costs alone.
A number of years ago, I (Dr. Rassman) had a meeting with Sy
Sperling, owner of Hair Club for Men, when he needed an affiliation
with a doctor to go into the hair transplant business. At that time,
he told me that the average income the company budgeted from a
hair system over a five-year period was approximately $12,500.
That was in 1996, so calculate what inflation has done to this cost! I
doubt that the costs have come down.
A Bald Head Runs Hot and Cold
Hair is more than a vanity symbol; it keeps your head warm in the
cold months of winter and protected from the sun in the heat of the
summer. Hair works as a natural source of insulation — as any bald
person can tell you. It has been calculated that people lose 50 per-
cent of their body heat through the head when in freezing tempera-
tures! Napoleon’s army lost the bald men first in the freezing Russian
winter. Although fighting in the Artic climes may not be in your future,
a winter in a Northern climate can feel almost as cold at times.
In addition to the insulation it provides in cold weather, hair also
provides cool shade when the weather is hot and the sun is strong,
and it protects your scalp against the UV rays of the sun, keeping
down the risk of skin cancer.
You’re Tired of Toupees, Creams,
and Other Disguises
As a bald man, what can you do about your condition? The non-
surgical options are many, but they may all seem less than attrac-
tive. For example, grow a foot-long strand of hair to comb across
the top, and you may be laughed out of town (see the section
“You’re Ready to Ditch the Infamous Comb-over” later in this 
section for more on this so-called solution to hair loss). Ditto for
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
266

wearing inexpensive, obvious toupees, the worst of which give the
impression of a small furry animal draped over the head. Much-
hyped hair restoratives like Rogaine usually are only successful, if
they are successful, on top-of-the-crown bald spots — if those spots
haven’t already expanded beyond the diameter of a small potato
chip. Unfortunately, Rogaine doesn’t grow back the hair to full
thickness. You could shave your scalp, concealing your shame by
pretending to revel in it. Or you can grow a beard to shift public
attention to the nether end of your head. With all these proposed
solutions, nobody has to suspect that you’re actually bald, but they
likely will anyway because non-surgical solutions are less effective
at concealing hair loss than a hair transplant. Also, you’re likely to
get really sick of toupees, creams, and other disguises really fast.
You Want to Improve Your 
First Impression
No one likes to be judged by their appearance, but unfortunately,
appearances do matter, and it’s hard for people to get to know the
real you if they can’t get past the first impression. The reality is
that the first impression is usually a physical one — whether it’s in
person or in a photo, such as on a dating Web site.
When it comes to dating, other things being equal, most men and
women prefer a partner with a full head of hair because of a percep-
tion that balding reflects an older, less vibrant, and less sexually
capable man. Hair has been unfairly, and incorrectly, associated
with health and youth. Women see men with hair loss and automati-
cally assume the men are unhealthy or old.
You’re Ready to Go Au Naturel
“Au naturel,” French for “in the natural (state),” is often used to
mean “nude,” but when it comes to hair, nude isn’t always your
best option! There’s nothing wrong with having hair . . . up there! A
hair transplant today looks and feels like your natural hair, growing
like it did before it disappeared! You get a hair transplant and then
forget about it except for routine haircuts. Wigs, toupees, and hats
only offer a temporary cover up, whereas a hair transplant is a per-
manent and natural solution to baldness.
Many people have a negative opinion of hair transplants as looking
unnatural. Terms such as “doll’s head” or “plugs” come to mind.
But today’s hair transplant procedures have evolved. For example,
Chapter 17: Ten Reasons to Consider a Hair Transplant 267

follicular unit transplantation (FUT) is a technique in which hair is
transplanted from the permanent zone in the back of the scalp into
areas affected by genetic balding, using only the naturally occur-
ring, individual follicular units. If performed well, the results are
undetectable even to the trained eye. A good, modern hair trans-
plant is undetectable to anyone not in the know about your origi-
nal follicular state. The look is completely au naturel.
You’re Ready to Ditch the
Infamous Comb-over
In the beginning of our hair restoration practice, we couldn’t help
notice the most common hair style for balding men: the slicked
side-to-side hair that runs from just above one ear to the other side
over the bald head. The comb-over, as it’s commonly known, has
been popular with many men who grow the hair in the donor area
(normally the sides/back of head for men) longer than normal to
cover the balding area. Eventually, less and less hair is available to
cover more and more surface area as the balding progresses.
We’ve always wondered how men reach the stage of the comb-over
as a solution for their hair loss. It’s clear that this style is a process
that takes years to evolve as the man tries to preserve his old hair
style by making use of ever diminishing quantities of hair. A comb-
over style works for most men until the hair loss gets too bad and
the bald area is too large. This is such a slow insidious process
that most men don’t notice it happening. John McCain is a good
example of a man who uses the comb style and it is on the cusp of
looking foolish. 
How do the friends and families of these men with advanced, fool-
ish-looking comb-overs keep their mouths shut about how silly it
looks? It seems that they just go along with the deception to pro-
tect their loved one’s feelings, or they may be just too embar-
rassed to speak the truth. If you love someone, you can usually
manage to overlook their imperfections, if not downright oddities,
but the staring eyes from friends and strangers can sometimes be a
bit much to bear. When you reach a point at which you’re ready to
ditch your comb-over, a hair transplant is the best next step you
can take.

You Don’t Like Using Sun 
Screen on Your Head 
The presence of a bald crown or a bald head produces a problem
that most non-bald men never think about. Sun burns! And these sun
burns eventually lead to a type of skin cancer. If you look carefully at
the head of a balding man over the age of 50 or so, you will see dark-
ened spots on the bald areas of the scalp. Many of these spots are
precancerous lesions and they must be checked frequently by a
good dermatologist.

Chapter 18
Ten Facts about the FDA and
Hair Products
In This Chapter
 Finding out how hair products are regulated for your safety
 Monitoring hair growth drugs and devices
I
n the United States, it’s common to assume that the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) looks out for consumer’s welfare
when it comes to hair products, from over-the-counter drugs to
medical devices for stimulating hair growth.
But does it? As this chapter reveals, the answer is both yes and no.
If you’re wondering what the FDA’s mission is, here is its mission
statement:
The FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by
assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veteri-
nary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation’s
food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The
FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by
helping to speed innovations that make medicines and foods
more effective, safer, and more affordable; and helping the
public get the accurate, science-based information they need
to use medicines and foods to improve their health.
Sounds like some lofty goals and really big jobs, and they are. But,
not too surprisingly, the FDA can’t be everywhere all the time,
which is why contaminated medications, tainted food, and danger-
ous devices do occasionally make it onto the market. However, the
FDA does its best to keep things safe.
What is the FDA’s involvement in hair loss issues? Well, snake oil
salesmen and charlatans still have no trouble pedaling their prod-
ucts to hairless and desperate consumers. In this chapter, we look

at the myths and truths about what the FDA does and doesn’t do
when it comes to hair loss.
It Doesn’t Approve Shampoos 
and Conditioners
Yes, it’s true — the FDA wants you and your dermatologist to know
what’s in your shampoo and conditioner and mandates that sham-
poo and conditioner manufacturers list all ingredients on the backs
of the containers. The agency also prohibits manufacturers from
making any false claims about what your shampoo or conditioner
can do for your hair.
Most shampoos and conditioners are regulated as cosmetics, which
means that companies can put them on the market without prior
FDA approval. This fast-track to store shelves doesn’t mean cosmet-
ics are unsafe. In fact, most shampoos and hair conditioners are
perfectly safe when used as directed. Care should be taken to keep
shampoos out of the eyes because that, as you know, can cause
stinging. Some consumers who use the same shampoo for years
can develop an allergy to it and should switch to another brand.
However, not all shampoos and conditioners are created equal.
Shampoos that contain ingredients designed to treat conditions
such as dandruff or psoriasis are regulated by the FDA as drugs,
not cosmetics, and that means those shampoos are subject to
more extensive regulations, as discussed later in this chapter.
It Doesn’t Approve Most
Permanent Hair Dyes
As we explain in Chapter 3, there are three types of hair dye:
 Permanent
 Semi-permanent
 Temporary
All three types can contain coal-tar dyes, potent chemicals that can
cause potential safety problems, including irritation and allergy.
Note that “Coal-tar” dyes are not really made from coal-tar any-
more. They are made from petroleum but the old name is still
found in FDA regulations and FDA laws. 
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
272

One type of permanent hair dye is the “progressive” type. This dye
contains either lead acetate or bismuth citrate, both of which have
been approved and listed in the Code of Federal Regulations for
coloring scalp hair only as a result of petitions submitted to the
FDA. Henna has also been listed. 
Unlike color additives used in other cosmetic products, Congress
exempted oxidation-type coal-tar hair dyes from its listing and
certification regulations. In such cases, all the agency can do is
require adequate directions for preliminary patch testing by
consumers for skin sensitivity and that the following warning
statement appear on the label:
Caution: This product contains ingredients which may cause
skin irritation on certain individuals and a preliminary test
according to accompanying directions should first be made.
This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or
eyebrows; to do so may cause blindness.
Since anyone can become sensitized to hair dyes with time, patch
tests are urged each time before a consumer intends to use an oxi-
dation hair dye.
Oxidation (or “coal-tar”) hair dyes contain synthetic organic dyes
and dye intermediates made from petroleum that penetrate the
hair shaft in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia. This
results in a coloring of the hair that lasts a long time.
A few permanent dyes have been shown to cause cancer in animals.
Progressive hair dyes are made with lead acetate, or less frequently,
bismuth citrate. These FDA-approved dyes gradually darken the
hair by oxidizing on the hair surface and reacting with the sulfur in
the keratin of the hair shaft. (Refer to Chapter 2 for an explanation
of the structure of hair.)
Semi-permanent and temporary dyes also contain coal-tar dyes,
but they adhere to the surface of the hair shaft for much shorter
periods of time than permanent dyes.
FDA Gets Help from the Courts 
to Protect Consumers
It’s no surprise that the FDA gets the most complaints from con-
sumers about hair relaxers (straighteners) and hair dyes. Each
contain powerful chemicals that can cause harm, especially if used
incorrectly by consumers that do not understand the risks.
Chapter 18: Ten Facts about the FDA and Hair Products 273

The FDA tries to inform the consumers to take a proactive
approach in using such products safely. The agency also reviews
consumer complaints and, when it finds a pattern of unusual or
severe reactions, it conducts an investigation and requests a com-
pany to voluntarily remove the product from the market. But the
agency doesn’t have pre-approval authority for cosmetics and
sometimes needs help in getting an unsafe product off the market.
Take the example of the World Rio Corporation of California. It
marketed two hair relaxers, the Rio Naturalizer System (Neutral
Formula) and the Rio Naturalizer System with Color Enhancer
(Black/Licorice). Consumers had complained to the FDA about hair
loss, scalp irritation, and discolored hair. The FDA requested that
the company cease marketing these products. In December 1994,
they agreed to stop sales and shipments of the products. 
The FDA discovered, however, that the company had continued to
take orders. The California Department of Health then also asked
them to stop sales. Finally, in January 1995, the U.S. Attorney’s
Office in Los Angeles filed a seizure action against these products
on behalf of the FDA. 
In the resulting consent decree of condemnation and permanent
injunction, the FDA noted that it received more than 3,000 com-
plaints about the Rio products. The agency alleged that the prod-
ucts were potentially harmful or injurious when used as intended,
that they were more acidic than declared in the labeling, and that
the labeling described the products as “chemical free” when
“allegedly they contained ingredients commonly understood to
be ‘chemicals.’” 
Hair relaxers (known also as hair straighteners) are generally alka-
line rather than acidic products. Lye or another strongly alkaline
chemical is used to break the bonds in the hair. Lye can cause
burns to the scalp if left on too long or not properly washed out
with shampoo and conditioner. Getting help from someone else in
applying and removing the relaxer can help ensure all is removed
and neutralized. 
Since lye can cause burns to the face, lungs, and esophagus if swal-
lowed, parents are urged to keep this product out of reach of chil-
dren. When using a relaxer on children, be especially careful to
keep it off the skin and out of their eyes.
Since hair relaxers can result in hair breakage, baldness, burns,
and emergency room visits, special care is urged when using these
products. Some people use petroleum jelly on their heads to form
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
274

a protective barrier before using a hair relaxer. A neutralizing
shampoo should be used after treatment, followed by a hair condi-
tioner. Consumers should avoid scratching their heads or brushing
hair before using a relaxer. 
And don’t leave the relaxer on too long! Using a relaxer too fre-
quently can damage the hair. It’s also not a good idea to use a per-
manent oxidation (coal tar) dye the same day as you use a hair
relaxer because the chance of hair damage increases.
It Protects You from Cosmetic Hair
Growth Product Scams
In 1989, the FDA, concerned about consumer gullibility, banned all
topical lotions, potions, creams, and other cosmetic gunk that
claimed to grow hair where there was no hair. However, these prod-
ucts have now begun to crop up on the Internet. From the FDA’s
perspective, shutting down these scams must be like picking fleas
off a dog — every time they remove one, another one jumps up. 
The bottom line? No matter what you see and hear on late-night
TV, a product can’t grow a single hair on your head if you have
nothing to start with. You can write to the FDA or Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) to complain about such products. The FDA reg-
ulates labeling claims while the FTC regulates advertising.
It Approves All Prescription Drugs
That Claim to Grow Hair
You can rest assured that any new prescription drug claiming to
grow new hair has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials. After a
certain number of years, though, the patent on brand name drugs
expires, and other companies can manufacture the same drug
under a different name as a generic drug. 
For example, under the brand name Proscar, finasteride was manu-
factured by Merck and originally covered by U.S. and international
patents to treat benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH). A separate
patent for the drug was issued to treat male pattern baldness
under the name Propecia. 
Chapter 18: Ten Facts about the FDA and Hair Products 275

Finasteride is now off-patent for use in treating BPH and is sold
under several generic names. Propecia won’t be off-patent until
2013, at which time generic versions will undoubtedly appear.
Because generic drug makers don’t develop a drug from scratch,
their costs to bring the drug to market are much lower, but they
must show that their product works in the same way as the brand-
name drug. No clinical trials, however, are required. All generic
drugs are approved by the FDA, and the FDA assures the public
that they’re equivalent to the original medications.
It Doesn’t Pre-Approve Over-the-
Counter Hair Growth Drugs
Drugs that are sold over-the-counter (OTC) aren’t subject to pre-
market FDA approval, but it does oversee OTC drugs to ensure that
they’re properly labeled and that their benefits outweigh their
risks. There are more than 80 classes of OTC drugs, including prod-
ucts for hair growth and loss, antifungal products, sunscreen, and
weight-control drugs.
Particular classes of OTC drugs are subject to a monograph
system. Monographs specify the active ingredients, labeling, and
testing required for the particular class of drugs. For example, if
you want to market a sunscreen, you can follow the sunscreen
monograph and go to market without submitting anything to the
FDA (except manufacturer registration and drug listing informa-
tion). However, if you want to add substantial new claims to a new
sunscreen or change the percentages of active ingredients that
appear in the monograph, you need to submit a very expensive
new drug application for FDA approval. The monograph system is
a convenient one for most manufacturers, but it does inhibit devel-
opment of improved products.
The FDA published a report in 1989, the Final Monograph on Hair
Grower and Hair Loss-Prevention OTC Drug Products for Human Use,
after a review of safety and efficacy data submitted by interested
companies. The FDA was, to say the least, unimpressed with what
it received, and the Monograph stated, “There are no agency-
approved OTC hair loss prevention drug products” and warned
companies not to market such products unless they want to risk
FDA action.
That’s why you don’t see OTC drugs with hair loss prevention
claims in your pharmacy.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
276

It Prevents Dietary Supplements
from Claiming to Cure Hair Loss
A dietary supplement is defined as “a product taken by mouth that
contains a ‘dietary ingredient’ intended to supplement the diet.”
Dietary supplements can be extracts or concentrates and may be
found in many forms, such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps,
liquids, or powders.
Manufacturers of dietary supplements usually don’t need to regis-
ter their products with the FDA and generally don’t need FDA
approval before producing or selling dietary supplements. The
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) instituted
in 1994 says that the FDA is only responsible for taking action
against an unsafe dietary supplement after it’s on the market.
It’s illegal to market a dietary supplement product as a treatment
or cure for a specific disease or condition, such as hair loss. Many
supplements and herbal remedies are nevertheless illegally adver-
tised as being able to cure hair loss. If you see a topical dietary
supplement with such claims, you can be sure that it’s illegal.
Advertising claims are regulated not by the FDA but by the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC). When a product has been proven unsafe,
such as what happened with Ephedra, the FDA can order it
removed from the market. But before that point, it’s up to you to
be a careful and sensible consumer when buying supplements.
It Doesn’t Require Much from
Class I Medical Devices
Medical devices fall into one of three classes with increasing com-
plexity and potential risk. Class I devices aren’t intended for use in
supporting or sustaining life or to be of substantial importance in
preventing impairment to human health. They also can’t present a
potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. 
Medical devices are usually exempt from premarket notification
submission requirements (the 510(k), a lower standard than FDA
approval that comes from an abbreviated process). The author (Dr.
Rassman) produced a medical instrument, ‘the hair implanter pen
(HIP)’ and this is an example of such a class I cleared device.
Chapter 18: Ten Facts about the FDA and Hair Products 277

It Requires Clearance for Class II
Medical Devices
Class II devices, including those for hair growth, require special
labeling and are held to a higher standard than Class I devices;
sponsors of the 510(k) must show the FDA that the proposed
device is at least as safe and effective as similar legally marketed
products in the U.S. Devices in this class are typically noninvasive
and include products like low-level laser therapy devices that
claim to grow new hair (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Medical_device - endnote_FDA3132). Most Class II products
require 510(k) clearance, which is a lower standard than FDA
approval.
One device that went through the 510(k) process and is now
touted on many Web sites as “FDA approved” is the low-level laser
treatment for home use, called the HairMax LaserComb(r). The
sponsor made the medical claim that this medical device could
grow hair, and that claim had to be addressed by the FDA before
the product could go on the market.
Because the LaserComb is a Class II product, the company
only had to show that it was as safe and effective as similar
legally marketed U.S. products. Only one study was done to show
that the LaserComb was safe and effective before it was cleared for
marketing. 
It Requires Thorough Testing and
Trials for Class III Devices
Class III medical devices need to be thoroughly tested in clinical
trials to ensure their safety and effectiveness over and above the
Class I and Class II controls. Examples include coronary heart
valves and stents. Hair care products and devices don’t fall into
the Class III category unless someone invents something that’s life-
supporting or life-sustaining and also grows hair.
Currently, with one exception, the hair-growing tools sold in your
local drugstore or big box store aren’t likely to be FDA approved or
even to have FDA clearance because their claims are limited and
their risks are low.

Appendix B
A Psychological Study 
of Hair Loss
C
linicians who work in the field of hair loss, as we do, know full
well that hair loss has a psychological impact on many
aspects of a person’s life. We see patients every day whose lives
have changed for the better after transplant, and it’s well estab-
lished that men and women with depression are more likely to be
bald than not.
We decided to send out a questionnaire asking about the psycho-
logical impact of hair loss and hair transplantation to 200 hair trans-
plant clients. A study looking at the benefits of hair transplantation
on psychological issues such as stress levels and self-esteem had
never been done before. This appendix explains what we learned.
The research was conducted at the New Hair Institute by Parsa
Mohebi, M.D., and William R. Rassman, M.D.
What the Survey Asked
Our survey focused on the following seven variables:
 General level of happiness
 Energy level
 Feeling of youthfulness
 Anxiety level
 Self-confidence
 Outlook on the future
 Impact on sex life
The survey asked patients to rate their psychological states before
and after hair transplant surgery.

Who Was Surveyed
We mailed our survey to patients who fit the following categories:
 Male patients with male pattern baldness
 Patients whose surgeries had been done in the past 1 to 3
years, so that the memory of their lives before transplant
were still fresh in their minds
 Patients who had had only one transplant
 Patients who had the follicular unit transplant
We sent the survey with a brief explanation of what we hoped to
accomplish (and a self-addressed stamped envelope). The ques-
tionnaire was blind, meaning it contained no client identifiers of
any kind. Individuals didn’t have cause to worry that we would
know who they were. Participation was completely voluntary, and
no incentives of any kind were given for participating.
What the Survey Showed
We received 37 questionnaires back from our survey, for an 18.5
percent return rate. The most immediate and striking result was
that all patients showed significant improvements in all eight
areas. The results are shown in Figure B-1.
Figure B-1: Comparison of psychological variables before and after hair
transplant.
Part VII: Appendixes 
290

Comparing older and younger
patients
We broke the results down by age, dividing patients into under and
over age 40 groups to see if there were any differences between the
two groups. The results are shown in Figure B-2.
Younger patients, perhaps not unexpectedly, felt that their trans-
plant had a larger impact on their future than older patients did.
Patients who experienced hair loss at an earlier age, while involved
in an active social life, experienced more negative effects from
balding and benefited the most from hair transplantation.
Figure B-2: Comparison of younger patients to older patients.
Comparing different 
balding patterns
We took the resulting data a step further to see if the type of bald-
ing pattern a patient had made any difference in his final results.
We broke the group into two: one group with Norwood pattern III-
IV (low hair loss), and the other group with Norwood pattern V-VII
(high class of hair loss). (See Chapter 4 for more on the Norwood
classifications in hair loss.) See Figure B-3.
Appendix B: A Psychological Study of Hair Loss 291

Figure B-3: Comparison of patients with low Norwood classification to those
with higher classification.
Analyzing the Results 
This study confirmed what we already knew from talking to
patients: Hair loss causes or worsens psychological problems such
as anxiety, fear in social situations, and even difficulties in career
advancement.
The good news is that reversing hair loss, particularly in younger
men who have less balding at the time of transplant, can reverse
its negative psychological effects and increase psychological satis-
faction in many life situations.
Although this study was valuable, our goal is to do a much larger
study. It’s admittedly difficult to get people to respond to a blind
survey without some type of incentive, so a larger, funded study
may result in more data.
Many people continue to feel that hair loss is nothing more than a
vanity issue and that concern about it is unwarranted. This study,
however, shows very clearly that hair loss is more than a vanity
issue; it has a profound effect on every aspect of a person’s life.
The research was conducted by Parsa Mohebi, M.D. and William
Rassman, M.D.

Appendix C
Glossary
L
ike many technical and medical topics, hair loss comes with its
own set of terminology. This glossary is designed to simplify
your reading and understanding of this book by giving you one
source for definitions related to hair and hair loss.
alopecia: The medical term for genetic hair loss.
alopecia areata (AA): A type of inherited skin disease that pro-
duces hair loss. AA often begins as patches of hair loss that spread
into larger and larger areas.
anabolic steroids: A group of hormones made from testosterone
that promotes tissue growth and the building of proteins.
anagen phase: The phase of the hair cycle when hair is growing.
The anagen phase lasts from between from one to seven years with
an average length of three years.
androgenic (or androgenetic) alopecia: Hair loss caused by a
combination of the male hormone and genes; also known as male
pattern baldness.
anti-androgen: Any substance that suppresses the production or
the effects of the male hormone testosterone.
apoptosis: A genetic process that produces cell destruction, failure
to grow, or cell death. Genes determine how many hair cycles a
particular hair will go through. The mechanism of how this works
probably relates to particular growth-stimulating molecules that
must be present for a hair to grow out. The genetic determination
of how many cycles a hair will go through and when that number is
reached occurs because some critical molecule fails to be pro-
duced. Each individual hair has a different cycle, so the death of
any particular hair varies by regions on the scalp and the genes
that are inherited from one’s parents.

aromatase: An enzyme that facilitates the conversion of the male
hormone testosterone into the female hormone estrogen. A
healthy hair is hormone dependent, and that dependency requires
the presence of both male and female hormones in some balance.
In women, a deficiency of aromatase causes an estrogen deficiency,
and estrogen supports healthy hair growth. When estrogen levels
are low in women, they experience hair loss, which explains why
so many women have hair loss when they go through menopause.
autosomal gene: A gene found on the non-sex chromosome.
catagen phase: The phase of the hair cycle during which the hair
prepares for its sleep phase and falls out.
chromophore: A molecule that absorbs light waves at a specific
wavelength and imparts a color to the molecule. Two types of pig-
ment molecules (called melanin) are produced at the base of the
hair bulb: eumelanin and phaeomelanin. All hair colors result from
a balance between these two molecules. See eumelanin and
phaeomelanin.
cobblestoning: Changes in the skin that appear like a cobblestone
street surface. The large plug hair transplants performed prior to
1990 produced such changes on the bald scalp.
cortex: The inner layer of a hair shaft found inside the cuticle. The
cortex contains bundles of compressed protein that make up the
inner part of the hair shaft.
cuticle: The outermost layer of a hair shaft. The cuticle is porous
and made up of scales, and it surrounds the inner elements that
make up the hair shaft.
cysteine: An amino acid readily oxidized to cystine.
cyproterone acetate: An anti-androgen that suppresses the action
of testosterone.
hydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): A weak steroid secreted by the
adrenal gland. As an androgenic steroid, it can cause hair loss.
Some people take this as a supplement and may very well increase
their hair loss. The mechanism of its action appears to be in the
metabolism of DHEA, which produces DHT (dihydrotestosterone),
the hormone in men that causes hair loss.
dermal papillae: An area of the hair follicle located at the base of the
hair bulb that’s active in controlling the growth of the hair follicle.
Part VII: Appendixes 
294

dihydrotestosterone (DHT): A hormone made from testosterone
and mediated by the enzyme 5-a reductase. This is the hormone
responsible for secondary sex characteristics like body hair, beard
hair, and changes in the voices of adolescent boys. DHT is also the
hormone that causes hair loss when a man carries the genetics for
hair loss.
diffuse unpatterned alopecia (DUPA): A disease of hair loss in
which the entire scalp is impacted by microscopic miniaturization
and visible thinning.
disulfide bonds: Part of the protein inside the cortex of the hair
shaft that isn’t water soluble and accounts for the strength of the
protein making up the bundles of hair.
dominant gene: A gene found on a chromosome that’s strongest and
expresses itself in a dominant position over other similar genes.
dutasteride: An FDA-approved drug for the treatment of prostate
enlargement that is presently under FDA consideration for the
treatment of hair loss.
eumelanin: Pigment molecule that controls black and brown hair
colors (produced by a dominant gene) and makes black or brown
hair. Blonde hair occurs when the concentration of this eumelanin
molecule is very low.
finasteride: An FDA-approved drug for the treatment of prostate
enlargement and hair loss.
5-a reductase: An enzyme critical for the chemical breakdown of
testosterone in producing dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
follicular unit: The basic hair follicular anatomy that contains
between one and five hairs, blood vessels, nerves, and connective
tissue.
follicular unit extraction: A minimally invasive surgery for remov-
ing follicular units for hair transplantation.
frontal fibrosing alopecia: A condition that causes hair loss and
scarring in the frontal area of the scalp. It’s most commonly found
in women over age 50 and is thought to be an autoimmune disease.
hair follicle: A single hair and its production anatomy below the skin.
Appendix C: Glossary 295

hair replacement system: An appliance containing hair that’s worn
on the head (also known as a “wig,” “toupee,” “hair piece,” or
“piece”).
hair shaft: The hard, dead output of a follicular unit. The shaft is
the part of the hair that shows above the skin and that is styled.
hair transplant: A surgical procedure in which hair is moved from
one part of the body to another.
hydrogen bonds: Proteins inside the cortex of the hair shaft that
are water soluble. These bonds break down easily and give hair its
flexibility. Hydrogen bonds come apart when the hair is wet and
come back together again as the hair dries.
laser: A device that stimulates a beam of coherent light. Some
people believe that a laser imparts energy to the scalp and hair fol-
licles and that this energy results in a positive impact on the
growth of the hair. Unfortunately, the scientific proof for this
theory is scant.
male pattern baldness: See androgenic (or androgenetic) alopecia.
medulla: An area of the hair shaft within the cortex.
megasession: A hair transplant session in which more than 1,000
follicular grafts are transplanted in a single session.
methionine: An amino acid containing sulfur, which is critical to
the growth of healthy hair. A deficiency of sulfur can cause hair
loss or weak hair. Sulfur is also critical in the production of healthy
fingernails and toenails and is found all over the body, including
the skin.
micrograft: A unit of hair containing between one and three hairs.
miniaturization: The process whereby the hair shafts on the scalp
have a reduced diameter when compared with normal healthy
hairs.
Minoxidil: A drug originally developed to treat high blood pres-
sure but that’s now used to treat hair loss topically.
Norwood classification: A classification of hair loss patterns as
seen in men.
phaeomelanin: Pigment molecule that produces red tint in hair.
Part VII: Appendixes 
296

saw palmetto: An extract of the fruit Serenoa repens. It’s sold in
health food stores for medicinal value and is thought to have value
in treating hair loss.
shock loss: Hair loss induced by some stressful event, such as hair
transplant surgery.
single strip harvesting: The removal of a section of scalp by exci-
sion for the purpose of hair transplantation. The hair follicles in
that section of scalp are removed from the scalp and inserted into
the bald scalp at the recipient area.
spironolactone: A drug that’s a weak diuretic and that has anti-
androgen (male hormone) effects. Because of the anti-androgenic
actions of this drug, doctors have been using it for years in the
treatment of female hair loss. No reputable scientific studies show
that it produces dependable, replicable results for hair growth.
telogen effluvium: A state of health in which many hair follicles on
the scalp go into the hair cycle of sleep at the same time. This
cycle lasts longer than the normal cycle length.
telogen phase: A phase of the hair cycle in which the hair enters a
sleep phase. This phase lasts around 100 days on average.
testosterone: The male hormone produced by the testicles that’s
responsible for the male sex drive. This hormone is metabolized
into DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is the cause for hair loss in
men with the genetic tendency for male pattern balding.
terminal hair: A fully grown hair that has normal thickness.
tinea capitus: A fungal disease of the hair and scalp that often
causes hair loss. It’s most frequently found in children and appears
as patchy hair loss.
traction alopecia: Hair loss from constant pulling of hair. It often
occurs as a result of styling or rubbing of the scalp. This process is
often permanent.
transection: The process whereby the deep hair follicle below the
skin is damaged or cut through. This occurs during the harvesting
process of a hair transplant.
trichotillomania: A medical condition in which a person picks at
his or her hair, causing baldness. Hair loss associated with this
condition is often permanent.
Appendix C: Glossary 297

vellus hair: Small hairs found in the scalp that don’t grow out to
full length or full thickness. Vellus hairs are found inside every fol-
licular unit and make up between 10 to 20 percent of the hair in the
healthy follicular unit.
wig: An appliance containing hair that’s worn on the head may be
used interchangeably with the term “hair replacement system, sys-
tems, or hair systems.”
