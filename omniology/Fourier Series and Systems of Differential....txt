Preface
In this volume I shall give some guidelines for solving problems in the theories of Fourier series and
Systems of Diﬀerential Equations and eigenvalue problems. The reader should be aware of that it has
never been my intention to write an alternative textbook, since then I would have disposed of the
subject in another way. It is, however, my hope that this text can be used as a supplement to the
normal textbooks in which one can ﬁnd all the necessary proofs.
This text is a successor of Calculus 1a, Functions of one Variable and Calculus 3b, Sequences and
Power Series, which will be assumed in the following.
Chapter 1 in this book is a short review of some important trigonometric formulæ, which will be
used over and over again in connection with Fourier series. This is a part of the larger Chapter 1 in
Calculus 3b, Sequences and Power Series. Here we shall we concentrate on the trigonometric functions.
This introducing chapter should be studied carefully together with Appendix A, which is a collection
of the important formulæ already known from high school and previous courses in Calculus. Since we
shall assume this, we urge the student to learn most of the formulæ of Appendix A by heart.
The text in the following chapters is more diﬃcult than the previous mentions texts on Calculus. The
Fourier series have always been included in the syllabus, but they have also been considered by the
student as very diﬃcult. I have here added a chapter with a catalogue over standard examples and
standard problems with their results, though without their corresponding calculations.
Then follows a little about linear systems of diﬀerential equations, where some results from Linear Al-
gebra are applied. I have tried always to ﬁnd the simplest methods of solution, because the traditional
textbooks follow the usual tendency of using a style which is more common in advanced books on
mathematics without giving the innocent reader any hint of how one may use this theory in practice.
In one of the variants we use the Caley Hamilton’s theorem known from Linear Algebra. This theorem
may, however, not be known to all readers. The theory is illustrated by (2 × 2)-matrices.
At last we give a short review of eigenvalue problems. This is really a diﬃcult subject, and it is only
possible to beneﬁt from it, when one at least knows the theory of Fourier series. On the other hand,
the eigenvalue problem is extremely relevant for the engineering sciences – here demonstrated by the
theory for bending of beams and columns. I also know of applications in the theory of chloride ingress
into concrete, let alone the periodic signals in emission theory. These applications have convinced me
that the eigenvalue problems are very important for the applications. On the other hand, the theory
is also diﬃcult, so it is usually played down in the teaching which to my opinion is a pity. I shall not
dare here to claim that I have found the right way to present these matters, but I shall at least give
it a try.
All notes from in this series of Calculus are denoted by a number – here 4 – and a letter – here b –
where
a stands for “compendium”,
b stands for “solution procedures of standard problems”,
c stands for “examples”.
Since this is the ﬁrst edition of this text in English, I cannot avoid some errors. I hope that the reader
will see mildly on such errors, as long as they are not really misleading.

Review of some important trigonometric formulæ
1.1
Trigonometric formulæ
We quote from Calculus 1a, Functions in one Variable, the addition formulæ
(1) cos(x + y) = cos x · cos y −sin x · sin y,
(2) cos(x −y) = cos x · cos y + sin x · sin y,
(3) sin(x + y) = sin x · cos y + cos x · sin y,
(4) sin(x −y) = sin x · cos y −cos x · sin y.
Mnemonic rule: cos x is even, and sin x is odd. Since cos(x ± y) is even, the reduction can only
contain the terms cos x·cos y (even times even) and sin x·sin y (odd times odd). We have furthermore
a change of sign on the term sin x · sin y.
Analogously, sin(x ± y) is odd, thus the reduction can only contain the terms sin x · cos y (odd times
even) and cos x · sin y (even times odd). Here there is no change of sign on sinus. ♦
We shall also sometimes need to simplify products like
sin x · sin y,
cos x · cos y,
sin x · cos y.
even
even
odd
We obtain these simpliﬁcations from the addition formulæ above:
2 sin x · sin y = cos(x −y) −cos(x + y),
(2) −(1),
2 cos x · cos y = cos(x −y) + cos(x + y),
(2) + (1),
2 sin x · cos y = sin(x −y) + sin(x + y),
(3) + (4).
We get our formulæ by a division by 2. They are called the antilogarithmic formulæ:
sin x · sin y = 1
2{cos(x −y) −cos(x + y)},
even,
cos x · cos y = 1
2{cos(x −y) + cos(x + y)},
even,
sin x · cos y = 1
2{sin(x −y) + sin(x + y)},
odd.
1.2
Integration of trigonometric polynomials
Problem: Find

sinm x · cosn x dx,
m, n ∈N0.
We shall in the following only consider one term of the form sinm x · cosn x of a trigonometric polyno-
mial, where m and n ∈N0.

We deﬁne the degree of sinm x · cosn x as the sum m + n of the exponents.
Concerning integration of such a term we have two main cases: Is the term of odd or even degree?
These two cases are again each divided into two subcases, so all things considered we are left with
four diﬀerent variants of integration of a trigonometric function of the type described above:
1) The degree m + n is odd.
a) m = 2p is even and n = 2q + 1 is odd.
b) m = 2p + 1 is odd and n = 2q is even.
2) The degree m + n is even.
a) m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q + 1 are both odd.
b) m = 2p and n = 2q are both even.
1a) m = 2p is even and n = 2q + 1 is odd.
Use the substitution u = sin x (corresponding to m = 2p even), and write
cos2q+1 x dx = (1 −sin2 x)q cos x dx = (1 −sin2 x)q d sin x.

Then we get

sin2p x · cos2q+1 x dx =

sin2p x(1 −sin2 x)q d sin x =

u=sin x
u2p · (1 −u2)q du,
and the problem has been reduced to an integration of a polynomial followed by a substitution.
1b) m = 2p + 1 is odd and n = 2q is even.
Use the substitution u = cos x (corresponding to n = 2q even), and write
sin2p+1 x dx = (1 −cos2 x)p cos x dx = −(1 −cos2)p d cos x.
Then

sin2p+1 x · cos2q x dx = −

(1 −cos2 x)p · cos2q x d cos x = −

u=cos x
(1 −u2)p · u2q du,
and the problem has again been reduced to an integration of a polynomial followed by a substitution.
2) Then consider the case where the degree m + n is even. Here the trick is to pass to the double
angle by the formulæ
sin2 x = 1
2(1 −cos 2x),
cos2 x = 1
2(1 + cos 2x),
sin x · cos x = 1
2 sin 2x.
2a) m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q + 1 are both odd.
Rewrite the integrand in the following way:
sin2p+1 x · cos2q+1 x =
1
2(1 −cos 2x)
p 1
2(1 + cos 2x)
q
· 1
2 sin 2x.
Then the problem is reduced to case 1b), and we get by the substitution u = cos 2x that

sin2p+1 x · cos2q+1 x dx = −
1
2p+q+1 · 1
2

u=cos 2x
(1 −u)p(1 + u)q du.
The problem is again reduced to an integration of a polynomial followed by a substitution.
2b) m = 2p and n = 2q are both odd.
This is actually the worst case. First we rewrite the integrand in the following way:
sin2p x · cos2q x =
1
2(1 −cos 2x)
p 1
2(1 + cos 2x)
q
.
We see that the left hand side has degree 2p + 2q in (cos x, sin x), while the right hand side has got its
degree halved p + q with respect to (cos 2x, sin 2x), i.e. described by the double angle. On the other
hand we have also got one term written as a sum of more terms which now should be handled one by
one.
Since the degree is halved whenever 2b) is applied, and since the other cases can be calculated straight
away, we see that the problem can be solved in a ﬁnite number of steps.

Example 1.1 Consider the integral

cos6 x dx.
The degree 0 + 6 = 6 is even and both m = 0 and n = 6 are even, so we are in case 2b). By using the
double angle we get the calculation
cos6 x =
1
2(1 + cos 2x)
3
= 1
8(1 + 3 cos 2x + 3 cos2 2x + cos3 2x).
Integration of the ﬁrst two terms is easy:
1
8

(1 + 3 cos 2x) dx = 1
8 x + 3
16 sin 2x.
The third term is again of type 2b), hence we shall here consider the quadruple angle,

3 cos2 2x dx = 3

2(1 + cos 4x) dx = 3

(1 −sin2 2x) · 1

cos6 x dx = 5
16 x + 1
4 sin 2x −1
48 sin3 2x + 3
64 sin 4x.

Fourier series; methods of calculation
2.1
General
The Theory of Fourier Series is a special case of the theory of series. Its purpose is to break up a
periodic function
f(t + T) = f(t)
for every t ∈R
into basic oscillations. The main case is when T = 2π, where one gets
f ∼1
2 a0 +


n=1
{an cos nt + bn sin nt}
with the coeﬃcients
an = 1
π

 π
−π
f(t) cos nt dt,
bn = 1
π

 π
−π
f(t) sin nt dt,
and where the integration over [−π, π[ can be replaced by any other interval of length 2π, e.g. [0, 2π[.
In the general case we get by the change of variable
τ = T
2π t ∈[0, T[
for t ∈[0, 2π[.
The symbol ∼requires a comment. It means that the sequence of segments
sn(t) = 1
2 a0 +
n

k=1
{ak cos kt + bk sin kt} ,
n ∈N,
converges in the sense of “energy” (also called in square mean, or in L2) towards f. This means more
explicitly,
lim
n→∞

 π
−π
|f(x) −sn(x)|2dx = 0.
In particular, one can within the error of any ε > 0 approximate the energy of a signal f(t) by a ﬁnite
sum sn(x), which will make the engineering considerations somewhat easier.
This terminology sounds like a course in transmission of e.g. radio waves, but actually Fourier Analysis
can be found in many other disciplines, like e.g. diﬀusion over some ﬁnite interval. Furthermore, it is
closely connected with the eigenvalue problems, cf. Chapter 5. The generalized Fourier series occur very
frequently in technical literature, where properties of materials may be built into the eigenfunctions.

becomes the most important theorem in the engineering applications.
On the other hand, most
students will in their beginning of their studies consider this theorem as “quite odd”.
The explanation is that the space
L2(([−π, π[) =

f : [−π, π[ →R


can be considered as a generalization of the Euclidean space to an inﬁnite dimensional space, when we
supply it with the inner product (the chosen notation here comes from Quantum Mechanics, where
one also can meet Fourier series)
f, g := 1
π

 π

f(t)g(t) dt.
With this inner product we obtain that the system

becomes an inﬁnite orthonormal basis, and the Fourier series of f is exactly the description of f with
respect to this orthonormal basis (cf. Linear Algebra)

Then Parseval’s equation becomes nothing but Pythagoras’s theorem in inﬁnite dimensions.
The
strange factor 1
2 is due to the fact that
1
√
2 is the normed basic element, while the constant 1 is not
normed. On the other hand, 1 is easier to work with than
1
√
2, so usually one chooses to stay with
the factor 1
2 in the formulæ.
The students’ precariousness of the Theory of Fourier series is caused by the “unusual” convergence
in energy instead of in a pointwise sense. At this stage of the education the teaching is still mostly
focussing on pointwisely deﬁned functions. Fortunately the main theorem for Fourier series gives a
very useful pointwise result.
Let f : [−π, π[ →R be a given function. Whenever we consider a point of discontinuity t0 of the
type where the limits exist from the left and from the right without being equal, we redeﬁne f to the
so-called normalized function f ∗by
f ∗(t0) =







1
2{f(t0−) + f(t0+)}
for t0 ∈] −π, π[,
1
2{f(π−) + f(−π+)}
for t0 = −π,
where f(t0−) = limt→t0−f(t) and f(t0+) = limt→t0+ f(t), i.e. the limits from the left and from the
right respectively.
The function f (or f ∗) is called piecewise diﬀerentiable, if one can remove a ﬁnite number of points
x1, . . . , xn from [−π, π[, such that the restriction of f to each of the open subintervals is continuously
diﬀerentiable, i.e. f  is continuous.
If the periodical function f is piecewise diﬀerentiable without vertical half tangents, i.e. f (t) does
not tend to ±∞anywhere, we say that f belongs to the class K∗
2π (or in general K∗
T ), and we write
f ∈K∗
2π.

Remark 2.1 We shall never see in the elementary courses of Calculus that f has a vertical half tan-
gent in a Fourier problem. The obvious reason is that the corresponding integrals cannot be calculated
explicitly. But there are also other reasons. It is true that Volterra once constructed an example with
a vertical half tangent and where the Fourier series does not converge in the corresponding point,
but this example lies far beyond what can be expected in an elementary course in Calculus. Fur-
thermore, it can be proved that e.g. f(t) =
√
π2 −t2 for t ∈[−π, π[ has vertical half tangents for
t = ±π, and its Fourier series is actually pointwise convergent everywhere with the right sum f(t),
so this condition which occurs in some textbooks is somewhat restrictive. Finally, one may refer to
Carleson’s theorem which states that if f only is of ﬁnite energy, (more precisely, f is “measurable”
and squared integrable over [−π, π[; every function occurring in engineering sciences is “measurable”
in the mathematical sense), then its Fourier series is pointwise convergent “almost everywhere” (i.e.
outside some “meagre set”) with the right sum f(t). Therefore, it is no point in demanding of the
student that he should check that the function f(t) does not have vertical half tangents, when this
never will have an impact on the technical applications. ♦
We have
Theorem 2.2 Main theorem. (Riemann’s theorem).
Assume that f ∈K∗
2π. then the Fourier series of f is pointwise convergent everywhere with f ∗(t) as
its sum. Hence
f ∼1

n=1
{an cos nt + bn + sin nt}
and
f ∗(t) = 1



for all t ∈[−π, π[.
2.2
Standard procedure for solution of problems in Fourier series, T = 2π
1) Sketch the graph of f over a periodic interval and also into the two neighbouring intervals.
One should always do this no matter how the problem is formulated. By this extension into the
neighbouring intervals we can immediately see if the end points of the interval are continuity points
or not.
2) Normalize the function f(t) to f ∗(t) by the formula
f ∗(t) = 1
2{f(t−) + f(t+)}.
In a point of continuity we get f ∗(t) = f(t), and in every point of discontinuity the function f ∗(t)
is the mean of the limits from the left and from the right. (It is possible to construct examples,
where one cannot apply this deﬁnition, but such examples are far too diﬃcult for an introductory
course in Fourier Analysis). Since we already have sketched the graph of f in 1), it is now easy
also to sketch the graph of f ∗on the same ﬁgure by e.g. using another colour for the points in
which f ∗(t) = f(t).
3) Explain why f ∗(or f) belongs to the class K∗
2π.
Check that

a) f ∗is piecewise C1, i.e. the periodic interval can be divided by a ﬁnite number of points into a
ﬁnite number of open subintervals, such that f is diﬀerentiable with a continuous derivative in
each of these subintervals.
It is of no importance if f ∗is discontinuous in a ﬁnite number of points. We choose the division
points as the points of discontinuity and the points of continuity in which f  either does not
exist or is discontinuous.
b) f ∗does not have a vertical half tangent in any end point for any of the open subintervals
mentioned above (if one is so unlucky to have a textbook, in which this unnecessary condition
should be checked as well).
Any function occurring in the introductory courses in Calculus or in engineering applications will
always belong to the class K∗
2π. Even if there exist many periodic functions which do not lie in
K∗
2π, none of these has any importance when a physical or technical situation is modelled.
4) Refer to the main theorem and conclude that the Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere
with the normalized function f ∗(t) as its sum function.
From now on we can replace ∼by =, and we have answered a question which always will occur in
a problem on Fourier series. Notice that one should always give an argument for writing = instead
of ∼.
These ﬁrst preparatory four steps can always be made without calculating one single integral.
5) Calculate the Fourier coeﬃcients

(Possibly an integration over some other periodic interval, though it usually is the symmetric
interval [−π, π] because we get some extra information when f(t) is either an even or an odd
function).
During these calculations we may get into some integration problems:
a) If there is given a hint, set up the integrals and use the hint.
b) If f(t) is composed of polynomials, exponentials or hyperbolic functions, apply partial integra-
tion.
c) If f(t) contains trigonometric functions, we ﬁrst reduce the products of these by the antiloga-
rithmic formulæ
cos A cos B = 1
2{cos(A −B) + cos(A + B)},
sin A cos B = 1

2{cos(A −B) −cos(A + B)}.
After this reduction we continue with a partial integration.

Remark 2.2 Be very careful when a partial integration is applied because one may unawares
divide by 0. This is actually the most common error made by students in problems like this.
Therefore, always check whether some value of n gives 0 in the denominator. Such values of n
require a separate treatment.♦

7) Concerning uniform convergence of the Fourier series we have two (not exhaustive) possibilities:
a) If f ∗(t) has at least one point of discontinuity (which e.g. can be seen from the graph sketched
in point 1)), then it follows from a theorem in any textbook on Fourier Analysis (refer to this
theorem!) that the convergence cannot be uniform. In fact, all the functions cos nt and sin nt
are continuous, and the sum function is not.
b) If f ∗(t) = f(t) is continuous, we consider the majoring series
1
2|a0| +
∞

n=1
{|an| + |bn|}.
If this majoring series is convergent (check!), then it follows from another theorem in any
textbook (refer to it!) that the Fourier series is uniformly convergent.
8) If one in connection with a Fourier series is asked about the sum of a series of numbers, then we
have two possibilities:
a) (The most frequent case). If the terms in the series of numbers look like the Fourier coeﬃcients,
then apply the main theorem, i.e. point 6) with equality and the adjusted function f ∗(t).
Insert some suitable t-values, typically t = 0, π or π
2 , and more rarely t = π
4 .
Then reduce.
b) (This does not occur so often.) If the terms of the series look like the sum of squares a2
n + b2
n,
and the series does not contain negative terms, then use Parseval’s equation
1
π

 π
−π
f(t)2dt = 1
2 a2
0 +
∞

n=1
(a2
n + b2
n).
In this case one should do the following
i) Calculate a0 = 1
π
 π
−π f(t) dt explicitly and then 1
2 a2
0.
It is due to the lack of the factor 1/2 of normalization that the errors usually occur here.
The student is wrongly inclined to square 1
2 a0 from the Fourier series itself, but then we
only get 1
4 a2
0. Therefore, be careful here.
ii) Since f(t) is given from the very beginning we can always calculate 1
π
 π
−π f(t)2dt.
iii) Insert and reduce.
9) It is possible here to set up the following task: Given a Fourier series. Find its pointwise sum
function f ∗(t).
One will, however, never get this task in an elementary course of Calculus, because the answer
requires some knowledge of Complex Function Theory, and even with such a knowledge this task
may be very diﬃcult. The problem is of course relevant in engineering applications because one by
using various measuring devices implicitly determines the coeﬃcients an and bn without knowing
the sum function. Here the mathematics becomes too diﬃcult for Calculus.

Standard Fourier series with pointwise results and Parseval’s equation
Some functions from K∗
2π appear very frequently in the engineering sciences. In this section we set
up a catalogue including the main results from these examples. The catalogue is a poor replacement
of the missing treatment in point 9) above. In the next section we give a similar list for a diﬀerent
purpose sorted out according to “type”.
We suppose in the following that all functions are periodic, so they will only be speciﬁed in a periodic
interval.

A list of problems in the Theory of Fourier series
It should be of some interest also to have a larger list of Fourier series. When the calculations are not
too diﬃcult the usual pattern will be the following:
a) Indication of a periodic interval.
b) Speciﬁcation of f in a periodic interval.
We shall here tacitly assume that there will be no trouble with the “vertical half tangents”, i.e.
we shall always assume that the half tangents do exist everywhere. It will be too cumbersome to
mention it every time.
c) The Fourier series with an indication of = whenever this is possible.
d) Possible pointwise results.
e) Parseval’s equation.
The subsections follow the type of the function. These are shortly listed here:
• A piecewise constant function.
• A piecewise linear function.
• A piecewise polynomial of second degree.
• A piecewise polynomial of third degree.
• A piecewise polynomial of fourth degree.
• A piecewise sinus.
• A piecewise cosine.
• Mixed sinus and cosine.
• A piecewise function composed by a polynomial times a trigonometric function.
• A function, in which the exponential function enters.
• The problem of the condition of vertical half tangent.
In the last mentioned subsection we discuss what is known and where this condition of avoiding
vertical half tangents stems from. The correct condition is that the function should be of bounded
variation (not deﬁned in these notes). Since every monotonous function in particular is of bounded
variation, we must necessarily have pointwise results for functions which are piecewise C 1 and which
are monotonous in the neighbourbood of every exception point.
We note that this list will contain more information than what is usually asked for.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

3.11
The problem of the assumption of no vertical half tangent
This condition, together with the assumption that the one-sided limits always exist are suﬃcient for
the pointwise convergence, though very far from necessary. It is rather awkward at exams, because
the student for a good reason do not understand why this condition is added. It is also awkward for
experts because it is not at all necessary. At this stage of Calculus some more convenient conditions
are the following:
1) The function is piecewise C1 as deﬁned in the textbook.
2) We demand in each of the open intervals in which the function is of class C1 that the derivative
f (t) has a limit (possibly ±∞), when t tends to any of the end points of the subinterval.
3) The function is bounded. (Less can do it. It suﬃces e.g. that the function is squared integrable,

 π
−π
f(t)2dt < ∞,
provided the period is 2π).
We mention as an example that the Fourier series for the periodic function f(t), which is given in the
periodic interval [−π, π] by
f(t) =

π2 −t2,
t ∈[−π, π],
converges pointwise everywhere towards f(t), in spite of the fact that f(t) has vertical half tangents.
Notice that the Fourier coeﬃcients of f(t) in this case can only be found by numerical integration.
I shall below sketch what one knows about pointwise convergence of Fourier series:
1) Carleson, 1965. If f ∈L2([−π, π]), then the Fourier series of f is pointwise convergent almost
everywhere with sum f(t). This result has later been extended by Hunt to f ∈Lp([−π, π]), p > 1,
i.e.
 π
−π |f(t)|pdt < ∞, cf. e.g. Jørsboe and Mejlbro, Carleson-Hunt’s theorem, Springer.
2) Kolmogorov constructed once in the beginning of the 1920s an example of a function f ∈L1([−π, π]),
the Fourier series of which is pointwise divergent everywhere.

3) Dirichlet, 1837, proved that if f is piecewise continuous and monotonous in a periodic interval,
then the Fourier series is pointwise convergent everywhere with the sum 1
2{f(t−) + f(t+)}.
4) Jessen, Mat 2, 1962–63, MI 124, quotes Jordan without any further reference that if the function f
of period 2π if of bounded variation (i.e. it can be written as a diﬀerence between two to monotonous
functions) on every ﬁnite interval, then the Fourier series is pointwise convergent for every t with
the sum
1
2{f(t+) + f(t−)}.
5) du Bois-Reymond, 1876, and Fej´er, 1911, both constructed continuous functions of period 2π, the
Fourier series of which are discontinuous in some points. Fej´er’s example can e.g. be found in
Jessen, Mat2, 1962–63, MI 126.
The functions under consideration are all bounded, piecewise continuous and piecewise diﬀerentiable.
I practice they will also be of bounded variation.
The justiﬁcation of the condition is that there exist continuous functions which are even continuously
diﬀerentiable with the exception of one single point and which are not of bounded variation. With
the additional assumptions given here this means that the limit of f (t) does not exist at all, when t
tends to one of the points, in which f is not diﬀerentiable. One example is
f(t) =

is of bounded variation, because one by some pottering can show that |f (t)| ≤3 for t ∈[0, 1].
These considerations indicate that one must really think in a strange way if one wants to create a
pointwise divergent Fourier series.

4.1
The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
Before we show the practical solution procedures we must mention the theoretical background, namely
the Existence and the Uniqueness Theorem. This is given in two versions of which the second one is
derived from the ﬁrst one.
Theorem 4.1 Existence and Uniqueness Theorem, 1st version. Let A(t) be a continuous
(n × n)-matrix for t ∈]a, b[, and let t0 ∈]a, b[.
Let v ∈Rn be a given vector, and u(t) a given
continuous vector function. Then the initial value problem
dx
dt = A(t)x + u(t),
x(t0) = v,
has precisely one solution.
Theorem 4.2 Existence and Uniqueness Theorem, 2nd version. Let a0(t), a1(t), . . . , an−1(t)
and u(t) be continuous functions in ]a, b[. Let t0 ∈]a, b[, and let v ∈Rn be a given vector. Then the
initial value problem





dnx
dtn + an−1(t) dn−1x
dtn−1 + · · · + a1(t) dx
dt + a0(t)x(t) = u(t),
x(t0) = v1,
x(t0) = v2,
. . . ,
x(n−1)(t0) = vn,
has precisely one solution.
It is very important in the 2nd version that the coeﬃcient of the term of highest order dnx
dtn is 1
(or is a function, which is never zero in ]a, b[). This is frequently neglected by the students. One can
make a similar remark to the 1st version of the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem, but the notation
here invites less to making an error.
There exists in general in the 2nd version only a solution formula, if one already knows n −1 linearly
independent solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Analogously for the 1st version
(because the 2nd version is derived from the 1st version). However, if the matrix of the system A is
constant, then we can in principle always ﬁnd the complete solution.
4.2
Solution of a linear homogeneous diﬀerential equation system with a
constant system matrix A
The most common problem is to ﬁnd the complete solution of the matrix equation
dx
dt = A x,
x = x(t),
where A is a constant (n × n)-matrix.
If we put u ≡0 in the 1st version of the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem we conclude that there to
any vector v = c ∈Rn exists precisely one solution. Considering c = (c1, . . . , cn) as a vector consisting
of n arbitrary constants we see that the complete solution must contain n arbitrary constants.
We shall here present ﬁve solution methods of this problem:

1) The eigenvalue method, real eigenvalues.
2) The eigenvalue method, complex eigenvalues, complex calculations.
3) The eigenvalue method, complex eigenvalues, real calculations.
4) Direct determination of the exponential matrix.
5) The fumbling method.
Of these. at least the 1st and the 2nd must be mastered by the student. Method number 4 is elegant,
but it may be considered as diﬃcult the ﬁrst time it is seen. The methods of the 3rd and 5th case are
some kind of emergency brakes. They should only be applied when everything else fails.
One should always (cf. the name “eigenvalue method”) start by ﬁnding the eigenvalues of the matrix
A with constant coeﬃcients (check!), i.e. the roots of the characteristic polynomial
P(λ) = det(A −λI).
We shall only go through these methods for (2 × 2)-matrices. The generalization to (n × n)-matrices
is left to the reader.

4.3
Eigenvalue method, real eigenvalues, A a constant (2 × 2)-matrix
We have here two possibilities: 1) two diﬀerent eigenvalues, and 2) two identical (multiple) eigenvalues.
1) Two diﬀerent real eigenvalues λ1 = λ2.
The corresponding eigenvectorer are (e.g.)
W1 =

a12
λ1 −a11
	
,
w2 =

a12
λ2 −a11
	
,
where A =

a11
a12
a21
a22
	
.
Proof. For i = 1 2 we get
(A −λiI)wi =

a11 −λi
a12
a21
a22 −λi
	 
a12
λi −a11
	
=

0
3
	
,
where 3 is also 0, because the two rows in A −λiI are linearly dependent when λi is an eigenvalue
and λ1 = λ2. An eigenvector is therefore perpendicular to any of the rows in A−λiI. (This means
that one interchanges the coordinates and changes the sign at only one place). If the ﬁrst row
should be the 0-vector, then choose the second row instead. 
The complete solution is
x(t) = c1 exp(λ1t) w1 + c2 exp(λ2t) w2,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
A fundamental matrix is
Φ(t) =

eλ1tw1
... eλ2tw2
	
=

w1,1eλ1t
w2,1eλ1t
w1,2eλ1t
w2,2eλ2t
	
.
The exponential matrix is
exp(At) = Φ(t)Φ(0)−1.
This can be found in a more elegant way by one of the methods in 4); cf. later.
The reader is here reminded of the method of inversion of a regular (2 × 2)-matrix, cf. Linear
Algebra:
B−1 =
 a
b
c
d
	−1
=
1
det B

d
−b
−c
a
	
,
det B = ad −bc = 0.
(Interchange the elements of the diagonal; change sing on the two remaining elements; divide by
the determinant).
2) Multiple eigenvalues, λ1 = λ2 = λ.
Here we have two cases, a) the eigenspace is of rang 2, or b) the eigenspace is of rang 1.
a) If the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue λ of multiplicity 2 has rang 2, then choose
two linearly independent eigenvectors w1, w2, and continue as in 1) above.

Calculus 4b
 
 
83 
 
b) If the eigenspace corresponding to λ of multiplicity only has rang 1, then ﬁnd the eigenvector
w1 as in 1) above, e.g.
w1 =

a12
λ −a11
	
,
A =
 a11
a12
a21
a22
	
,
λ1 = λ2 = λ.
Then determine w2 as a solution of the singular equation
(A −λI)w2 = w1.
The complete solution is then
x(t) = c1 eλt w1 + c2

t eλt, w1 + eλt w2

,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Proof. It suﬃces to prove that x(t) = teλtw1 + eλtw2 is a solution. By a calculation we get
dx
dt = teλt · λw1 + eλt(w1 + λw2)
and
A x = teλt · A w1 + eλt · A w2.
Since eλt and teλt are linearly independent, we have dx
dt = A x, if and only if the vectors of the
coeﬃcients agree,
A w1 = λ w1
og
(A −λ I)w2 = w1.
Now, w1 and w2 were precisely constructed in such a way that these two matrix equations are
satisﬁed. 
A fundamental matrix is
Φ(t) =

eλt w1
... teλt w1 + eλt w2
	
.
Since Φ(0) = (w1
... w2), we easily get the exponential matrix by the formula
exp(A t) = Φ(t)Φ(0)−1.
4.4
The eigenvalue method, complex conjugated eigenvalues, comples cal-
culations
When a real (2 × 2)-matrix has complex eigenvalues, then they are complex conjugated,
λ = a + iω
(og ˜λ = a −iω),
a, ω ∈R,
ω = 0.
Choose any one of these, e.g. λ = a + iω, where ω > 0. A corresponding complex eigenvector is then
e.g.
α + iβ =

a12
a −a11
	
+ i
 0
ω
	
,
A =
 a11
a12
a21
a22
	
.

(Interchange the ﬁrst row in A −(a + iω)I and change one sign).
If we instead use the second row in A −(a + iω)I for this construction, we get
˜α + i˜β =

a −a22
a21
	
+ i

ω
0
	
,
A =

a11
a12
a21
a22
	
.
Coinciding complex eigenvalues can for real matrices only occur when n ≥4. Such systems are too
big for problems in an elementary course of Calculus, so they will not be met here.
Expressed by the real vectors α and β the corresponding fundamental matrix becomes
Φ(t)
=

Re

e(a+iω)t(α + iβ)
 ... Im

e(a+iω)t(α + iβ)
	
=
eat cos(ωt)(α ... β) + eat sin(ωt)(−β ... α).
Since Φ(0) = (α ... β), it is easy to calculate the exponential matrix:
exp(A t) = Φ(t)Φ(0)−1.
Note here the alternative method in section 4.6.
The complete solution løsning is
x(t)
=
Φ(t)
 c1
c2
	
=
c1

eat cos(ωt) · α −eat sin(ωt) · β

+ c2

eat cos(ωt) · β + eat sin(ωt) · α

,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
4.5
The eigenvalue method, complex conjugated eigenvalues, real calcula-
tions
This variant is an emergency brake, which should only be applied if one does not like complex cal-
culations at all. The punishment is that even if the calculations can be performed they are always
extremely big.
1) If the eigenvalues are λ = a ± iω, ω = 0, then the structure of the solution is necessarily
 x1(t)
x2(t)
	
=
 a1eat cos ωt + a2eat sin ωt
b1eat cos ωt + b2eat sin ωt
	
.
2) Calculate
dx
dt
og
A x,
and identify the coeﬃcients of eat cos ωt and eat sin ωt.
3) Then we get two equations in the four unknown a1, a2, b1, b2. The two “missing” equations
correspond to the two arbitrary constants c1 and c2. Once this has been realized it becomes easy
to solve the system of equations.
One should be aware of that there in practice always will occur some very tricky calculations by this
method.

Direct determination of the exponential matrix exp(A t)
Let P(λ) = det(A−λ I) be the characteristic polynomial. Then by Caley-Hamilton’s theorem, possibly
known from Linear Algebra,
P(A) = 0.
For (2 × 2)-matrices we exploit this result in the following way:
First set up the characteristic polynomial in the following way,
P(λ) = λ2 + a1λ + a2 = (λ −a)2 + b,
i.e.
a = −a1
2
og
b = a2 −

When we put B = A −a I, it follows from Caley-Hamilton’s theorem that
B2 = −b I.

This result has the following nice consequence,
(5) B2n = (−b)nI
and
B2n+1 = (−b)nB.
Since I commutes with everything we get by an insertion into the exponential series that

We have now three possibilities which each should be considered more closely:
1) b = 0,
2) b > 0,
3) b < 0.
1) When b = 0, i.e. λ = a is a root of multiplicity 2 in the characteristic polynomial, then apart from
the ﬁrst term every term in the series are zero, hence
exp(A t)

(B = A −aI)

2) When b > 0 (i.e. the characteristic polynomial has the two complex conjugated roots λ = a±i

then we perform the following rearrangements of the series

3) When b < 0 (i.e. the characteristic polynomial has the two real roots λa = a±ω, where ω2 = −b >

The fumbling method
I have coined this name because the method typically is applied by intelligent students who did
not read the theory in the textbook and who at the examination nevertheless by chance fumble
themselves to the right idea. This method should only be applied when everything else fails, because
the calculations often are fairly complicated. The method is, however, far better than this name. when
the coeﬃcients are variable, because in that case all the methods mentioned above fail, since they all
assume that the matrix of the system A is constant.
1) Write the system of equations dx
dt = A x in full:





dx1
dt = a11x1(t) + a12x2(t),
dx2
dt = a21x1(t) + a22x2(t).
a) If e.g. a12 = 0, the ﬁrst equation is reduced to
dx1
dt = a11x1(t),
the solution of which is x1(t) = c1 exp(a11t). This solution is then inserted into the second
equation which then is solved by methods already mentioned in Calculus 1a, Functions in one
Variable. Analogously if a21 = 0.
b) If both a12 = 0 and a21 = 0, we get from the ﬁrst equation
(6) x2(t) =
1
a12
dx1
dt −a11
a12
x1(t).
Insertion of this expression into the second equation gives

i.e. after a small rearrangement,
(7) d2x1
dt2 −(a11 + a22)dx1
dt + {a11a22 −a12a21}x1(t) = 0,
which is a linear diﬀerential equation of second order and constant coeﬃcients.
This can
therefore be solved completely. The result is then put into (6), and one gets the corresponding
function x2(t).
Equation (7) is also written
d2x1
dt2 −trace A dx1
dt + det A x1(t) = 0,
where trace A is called the trace of the matrix, i.e. the sum of the elements in the diagonal,
and where det A is the determinant. Incidentally this shows that the problems are best sorted
according to the trace of the matrix of the system.
4.8
Solution of an inhomogeneous linear system of diﬀerential equations
An inhomogeneous system of diﬀerential equations
dx
dt = A x + u(t)
is solved by superposition, i.e. we ﬁrst determine all solutions of the corresponding homogeneous
system, and then ﬁnd a particular solution. Finally, all solutions of the homogeneous equation are
added to the particular solution.
Here I shall give two methods for determining the particular solution:
1) Systematic guessing. Examine the structure of the functions in u(t) and make a guess of a solution.
Test your guess by insertion. This method is recommended, because the alternative method below
can produce some very complicated calculations. (Problems in elementary Calculus can always be
solved by a clever guessing).
2) The general solution formula
x(t) = ϕ(t)c + Φ(t)

 t
t0
Φ(τ)−1u(τ) dτ,
t ∈]a, b[.
This should be avoided as much as possible! If one nevertheless is forced to use it, I shall here ease
matters a little:
a) First calculate Φ(t)−1u(t) = v(t).
b) Find the antiderivatives

v1(t) dt
and

v2(t) dt
separately! (i.e. not in some form of a matrix).
c) Insert ﬁnally into the solution formula.
The task will become big, but it should be possible to ﬁnish one’s calculations.

The eigenvalue problem of diﬀerential equations
This chapter is an alternative exposition of the usual one seen in textbooks, based on my experience
that the students have diﬃculties in seeing why this complex of problem is of interest. One must
at least have the Fourier series at hand in order to proﬁt from this fairly abstract set up, and this
assumption is not always followed in the textbooks. Let us begin by a review of the basis, already
given in Calculus 1a, Functions in one Variable.
5.1
Linear diﬀerential equations with constant coeﬃcients
Let a0, a1,. . . , an−1 be real constant. (The extension to complex constants should not make any

Assuming that E, I and N are all constants, this equation is reduced to
(9) d4w
dx4 −N
EI
d2w
dx2 = p(x)
EI ,
i.e. a special equation of the type (8).
A sound principle for linear diﬀerential equations like e.g. (8) is that a diﬀerential equation of order
n should be solved by n successive integrations, each giving a new arbitrary constant. We shall now
demonstrate that this is in fact true for (8).
The starting point is that the simplest possible diﬀerential equation
(10) dy
dx = q(x),
x ∈I,
is solved by just an integration and the complete solution is
(11) y = c +

 x
g(t) dt,
x ∈I,
c arbitrar constant.
Every exact solution formula will at some point go through the step from (10) to (11).
We shall demonstrate this by
(12) dy
dx −a y = q(x),
x ∈I,
a some complex constant.
Since we always have e−ax = 0, we see that (12) is equivalent to
(13)
d
dx

e−axy


dy
dx −a y

= e−axq(x),
i.e. precisely a formula of the type (10). We therefore get by an integration that
e−axy = c +

 x
e−atq(t) dt,
and we have derived the well-known formula, also presented in Calculus 1a, Functions in one Variable,
(14) y = c eax + eax

 x
e−atq(t) dt,
x ∈I,
c arbitrary.
Remark 5.1 Recall that if a = α + iβ is complex then
eax = exp((α + iβ)x) := eαx{cos βx + i sin βx}.

Theorem 5.1 Consider the linear equation of second order
(15) d2y
dx2 + a1
dy
dx + a0y = q(x),
x ∈I.
If R1 and R2 are the roots of the corresponding characteristic polynomial
R2 + a1R + a0,
which is obtained from the diﬀerential equation by replacing j diﬀerentiations by Rj, and no diﬀeren-
tiation by the constant 1, then the complete solution of (15) is given by
(16) y = eR1x

 x
e(R2−R1)t

 t
e−R2uq(u) du

dt + c1eR1x + c2eR1x

 x
e(R2−R1)tdt,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Proof. Since the roots are R1 and R2, we have
R2 + a1R + a0 = (R −R1)(R −R2) = R2 −(R1 + R2)R + R1R2,
hence
a1 = −(R1 + R2)
og
a0 = R1R2.
If we put
z = dy
dx −R1y,
we get
dz
dx −R2z = d2y
dx2 −R1
dy
dx −R2
dy
dx + R1R2 y = d2y
dx2 + a1
dy
dx + a0 y = q(x).
Therefore, equation (15) is equivalent to the two equations of ﬁrst order
dz
dx −R2 z = q(x)
and
dy
dx −R1 y = z(x).
According to (14) the ﬁrst equation has the complete solution
z(x) = c2eR2x + eR2x

 x
e−R2tq(t) dt.
By insertion into the second equation we again obtain an equation of the type (12), so by the trick in
(13) we get precisely (16). ♦
Remark 5.2 Notice that we do not make any particular assumptions on R1, R2, if only we mention
both of them. By this we mean that if R1 is a root of multiplicity 2, then we shall take R1 twice.
Therefore, R1 and R2 are allowed to be equal or diﬀerent, real or complex, and the succession of them
is also of no importance. This means that (16) is a general result.

We can only see the diﬀerence when we compare the case of R1 = R2 with the case of R1 = R2.
In the ﬁrst case we shall always get a factor of the type eαt, α = 0, on every integral, while we for
R1 = R2 = R get the following:
y

eRx

 x 


dt + c1eRx + c2eRx

 x
dt

eRx

 x
(x −t)e−Rtq(t) dt + ˜c1eRx + ˜c2x eRx.
This shows that when we have a root of multiplicity 2, then we shall get a factor x [and (x −t)] in
the formulæ. ♦
The corresponding homogeneous equation
d2y
dx2 + a1
dy
dx + a0 y = 0
is solved by putting q(x) ≡0 in (15) and (16),
(17) y = c1eR1x + c2eR1x

 x
e(r2−R1)tdt.
It is again seen that the solution of the inhomogeneous equation (15) is obtained by adding all solutions
(17) of the homogeneous equation to any particular solution, which is either found by guessing or is
calculated by the formula
y0 = eR1x

 x
e(R2−R1)t

 t

This principle is typically used by the method of guessing, where one can save oneself of some very
long and tedious integrations.
5.2
Special case; the guessing method
For linear equations of second order with constant coeﬃcients like in (15) it is always easy to ﬁnd
the complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, cf. (17) above. Then one can in
principle use the solution formula (16) to determine the complete solution. More general one may use
other solution formulæ occurring in the traditional textbooks.
The disadvantage of these solution formulæ is that one often is forced to go through some heavy
calculations of integrals, where even the pocket calculator or MAPLE do not like them. (It is therefore
recommended that one alternatively also try the guessing method for the determination of the solution
of homogeneous equation.
The idea is simple: If one e.g. by some humbug (one can also test the equation afterwards) has found
a solution of the inhomogeneous equation, then we get the complete solution by adding every solution
of the corresponding homogeneous equation.
The words “guessing method” sends actually a wrong signal to the reader. The method contains a lot
of systematism in spite of the name.
In lots of engineering applications (and to some extent also in mathematical applications) the inho-
mogeneous term q(x) in e.g. (15) is usually of one of the following types:

1) a polynomial
Ex.: q(x) = x2;
2) an exponential function
Ex.: q(x) = e−x;
3) a trigonometric function
Ex.: q(x) = sin 3x;
4) a product of functions of the types above
Ex.: x sin 2x;
5) a sum of functions of the types above
Ex.: e−x + xe−x.
Notice that by diﬀerentiation each of the classes above is either mapped into itself or into a simpler
class.
In the ﬁrst step we split functions from class 5) into single functions each from one of the classes 1)–4),
and we solve each of the new equations separately. (For polynomials it is even possible directly to
proceed further).

The main rule is: Always guess a solution of the same structure and test it by insertion into the
equation. (We here assume that the coeﬃcients are constant).
1) If e.g. q(x) = x2, guess y0(x) = k2x2 + k1x + k0, where k2, k1, k0 are determined by testing the
original equation. Since the degree of a polynomial is lowered by each diﬀerentiation, we can guess
the full polynomial of the same degree as q(x).
2) If e.g. q(x) = 6e−x, guess y0(x) = k · e−x. The test in the equation will give us the explicit value
of k.
3) If e.g. q(x) = sin 3x, guess
y0(x) = k1 cos 3x + k2 sin 3x,
and then k1, k2 is determined by testing this solution. Note that one always guess the full trigono-
metric polynomial because e.g. d
dx sin 3x = 3 cos 3x.
4) If e.g. q(x) = x2e−x, guess y0(x) = (k2x2+k1x+k0)e−x, just like in 1) and 2) above. The constants
are found by insertion into the diﬀerential equation-
5) Add all the solutions we have found already. Here we exploit that the diﬀerential equation is linear.
Exceptional case. If q(x) is a solution of the homogeneous equation (and of one of the types 1)–4)
above), then the method fails, because a guess of this type will always give 0.
The trick is here ﬁrst to guess the structure as above and then add a factor x. If this guess also is
a solution of the homogeneous equation we add another factor x, etc.. Since the equation is of ﬁnite
order, we shall only modify in this way a ﬁnite number of times.
Example 5.1 Find the complete solution of
d3y
dx3 −4 d2y
dx2 + 5 dy
dx −2y = 2ex −2x.
The characteristic polynomial
R3 −4R2 + 5R −2 = (R2 −2R + 1)(R −2) = (R −1)2(R −2)
has the roots R1 = R2 = 1 and R3 = 2.
the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
c1ex + c2x ex + c3e2x.
The right hand side q(x) = 2ex −2x is of type 5), so we split into
a) q1(x) = −2x,
and
b) q2(x) = 2ex.
a) Since q1(x) = −2x is not a solution of the homogeneous equation we guess y1(x) = ax + b. By
insertion into the equation we get
d3y1
dx3 −4 d2y1
dx2 + 5 dy1
dx −2y1 = 5a −(2ax + b) = −2ax + 5a −b.
This expression is equal to q1(x) = −2x when a = 1 and b = 5, thus
y1(x) = x + 5.

b) Since q2(x) = 2ex is a solution of the homogeneous equation, we ﬁrst guess c x ex. However, this
is also a solution of the homogeneous equation, so in our second guess we choose y2(x) = c x2ex.
It follows from
y2(x) = x x2ex,
dy2
dx = c(x2 + 2x)ex,
d2y2
dx2 = c(x2 + 4x + 2)ex,
d3y2
dx3 = c(x2 + 6x + 6)ex,
that we get by insertion
d3y2
dx3 −4 d2y2
dx2 + 5 dy2
dx −2 y2
= cex 
(x2 + 6x + 6) −4(x2 + 4x + 2) + 5(x2 + 2x) −2x2
= −2c ex.
This expression is equal to q2(x) = 2ex for c = −1, thus y2(x) = −x2ex.
c) We have now found a particular solution given by
y0(x) = y1(x) + y2(x) = x + 5 −x2ex.
d) The complete solution is then
y = x + 5 −x2ex + c1ex + c2xex + c3e2x,
x ∈R,
where c1 and c2 and c3 are arbitrary constants. ♦
5.3
The initial value problem
Given the linear diﬀerential equation of order n
dny
dxn + an−1
dn−1y
dxn−1 + · · · + a1
dy
dx + a0 y = q(x),
x ∈I.
Find the particular solution y = ϕ(x), x ∈I, which contains the line element (x0; y0, y1, . . . , yn−1).
This means that we demand for x = x0 that
y(x0) = y0,
dy
dx(x0) = y1,
. . . ,
dn−1y
dxn−1 (x0) = yn−1.
Since we specify y, dy
dx, . . . , dn−1y
dxn−1 to the initial “time” x0 we call this problem an initial value
problem. It is solved by ﬁrst ﬁnding the complete solution as described in the ﬁrst two sections above.
Then we calculate y(x), dy
dx, . . . , dn−1y
dxn−1 and insert x = x0. This gives us n linear equations in the n
unknown constants c1, c2, . . . , cn from the complete solution. It can be proved that if the equation
has constant coeﬃcients, then the solution is unique.
The constants c1, c2, . . . , cn are found by methods from Linear Algebra.
Therefore, initial value problems will hardly give one diﬃculties.

5.4
The boundary value problem
Contrary to the initial value problem it is much more diﬃcult to understand the meaning by the
boundary value problem, and why it is so interesting. Fortunately, Krenk: Mechanics and Analysis
of Beams, Columns and Cables, p. 160 sqq., gives an (ideal) example of applications, which I shall
brieﬂy sketch here.
Consider an ideal column exposed to a variable load P = −N > 0. The column is then compressed a
little, which usually is of no importance. For small loads P the column does not deviate much from
the vertical. However, for some critical load PE, called the Euler load, the column loses its stability
and it will bend from the vertical.
The task is not to describe and solve the problem of determining the critical load PE.
Assume that the column has the length 4 and that its bending module EI is constant. If we put
(18) λ = k2 = P
EI ,
where the load P is allowed to vary, the diﬀerential equation of the bending is in the normalized form
given by
(19) d4w
dx4 + k2 d2w
dx2 = 0

evt. d4w
dx4 + λ d2w
dx2 = 0
	
where
(20) M(x)
EI
= −d2w
dx2 .
The reason why P
EI in (18) is put equal to both λ and k2 is that one has diﬀerent traditions in the
two disciplines. In mathematics one will here typically write λ.
From a mathematical, though not an engineering point of view, it is “new” that one has given condi-
tions in both end points of the interval [0, 4], namely
w(0) = w(4) = 0
og
M(0) = M(4) = 0.
The model can now be formulated equivalently in the two “languages”:

the task is to ﬁnd the critical load PE, i.e. in reality k2 and λ in (21), such that this equation has
non-trivial solutions.
In Mechanics these non-trivial solutions to (21) are called the buckling modes wn(x) with the corre-
sponding buckling loads Pn = k2
n EI.

In Mathematics these non-trivial solutions of (21) are called the eigenfunctions wn(x) with the corre-
sponding eigenvalues λn.
Since the conditions on the solutions are not speciﬁed in a single point as it is by the initial value
problem, but instead in the boundary points of the interval [0, 4], we call this problem for a boundary
value problem.
Remark 5.3 (Important!) Apart from the fact that an initial value problem is speciﬁed in 1 point,
while a boundary value problem is speciﬁed in 2 points, there is also a fundamental diﬀerence in what
we want by the two problems:
1) Considering an initial value problem we want to specify an unique solution. Here x = t is typically
the time, and y is the coordinate of some particle to time t. This coordinate ought to be unique
for a given line element, if the model should be useful.
2) Considering a boundary value problem we want on the contrary to ﬁnd out when the solution is not
unique (“when something breaks down”), i.e. the opposite of the task in the initial value problem.
When this is the purpose, we also call the boundary value problem an eigenvalue problem. ♦

It should be obvious that it is important for a civil engineer to be able to estimate the load where
some given structure breaks down. When the maximal load is known we know something about the
dimensioning of the structure. As shown above this problem can be formulated as a boundary value
problem, and this should be suﬃcient for considering such problems. There is, however, much more
in the eigenvalue problem than one would guess at this stage.
In more advanced problems, e.g. when the stiﬀness EI is not a constant, it is roughly speaking possible
to construct the solutions by means of the eigenfunctions of
(22)

One determines (e.g. by means of computer programs like MAPLE, since the task is too big for the
old fashioned use of tables, and even advanced pocket calculators will meet their shortcomings here)
a sequence of eigenfunctions wn(x) = ϕn(x) with corresponding eigenvalues µn. These can be used
to describe the full technical model.
Here we need a small comment. It can be proved that the eigenfunctions uniquely determine a so-
called weight function k(x), such that the eigenfunctions {ϕn(x) | n ∈N} become orthonormal with
respect to the “strange” inner product,
(23) f, g =

 
0
f(x)g(x) · k(x) dx,
ϕn, ϕn =

1
for n = m,
0
for n = m.
Usually k(x) contains an ugly constant, which one chooses to omit. The price is that {ϕn(x) | n ∈N}
then only become orthogonal; apart from this the calculations become easier to perform.
We have actually already seen all this before, namely by the expansion of a function in a sinus series
over [0, 4], in which case k(x) ≡1. The expansion of a function after {ϕn(x) | n ∈N} by the inner
product (23) can therefore be regarded as a theory of generalized Fourier series. Many linear models
can in fact with advantage alternatively be described by its system of corresponding eigenfunctions,
even in the case of diﬀerential equations with variable coeﬃcients.
One has known this theory during the last century, but so far only the constant case (where we get the
Fourier series) can be calculated explicitly. First by the appearance of programs like Mathematica and
MAPLE it has become possible to calculate also more general cases. This means that these computer
programs have opened up for a lot of new possibilities of applications.
Since these notes are only meant for elementary Calculus the student will at this stage for the time
being never meet eigenvalue problems where the eigenfunctions can only be determined by programs
like MAPLE.

The formal deﬁnition of a linear boundary value problem is:
Deﬁnition 5.1 Boundary value problem. Given a linear diﬀerential equation of order n,
dny
dxn + an−1
dn−1y
dxn−1 + · · · + a1
dy
dx + a0y = q(x),
x ∈[a, b] ⊂R.
Find a solution y = ϕ(x), x ∈[a, b], which satisﬁes the m linear boundary conditions
r1,1ϕ(a) + · · · + r1,nϕ(n−1)(a) + r1,n+1ϕ(b) + · · · + r1,2nϕ(n−1)(b) = s1,
· · ·
rm,1ϕ(a) + · · · + rm,nϕ(n−1)(a) + rm,n+1 + · · · + rm.,2nϕ(n−1)(b) = sm.
Remark 5.4 This of course a formal and complicated deﬁnition, which should be reformulated as
soon as possible to matrices, if we shall keep our general view.
Unfortunately one is then easily
diverted from the real purpose of the problem, namely the applications in the engineering disciplines.
♦
Remark 5.5 In the practical applications we have m = n. the most commonly met applications are
given for m = n = 2. This is the reason why one can ﬁnd a lot of literature of this case, where the
boundary value problem has been reduced to
(24)










d2y
dx2 + a1
dy
dx + a0 y = q(x),
x ∈[a, b],
r1,1Y (a) + r1,2y(a) + r1,3y(b) + r1,4y(b) = s1,
r2,1y(a) + r2,2y(a) + r2,3y(b) + r2,4y(b) = s2.
Even in this reduced case there will usually only be two of the ri,js in each row of the boundary
conditions which are = 0.
It has been noticed that concerning beams it is more natural to consider m = n = 4, cf. Krenk. There
is no need explicitly to write down the general equations in this case. They are of course analogous
to (24). ♦
Remark 5.6 If we put
r1,2 = r1,3 = r1,4 = 0
and
r2,1 = r2,3 = r2,4 = 0
and r1,1 = 1 and r2,2 = 1 in (24), we get





d2y
dx2 + a1
dy
dx + a0 y = q(x),
x ∈[a, b],
y(a) = s1
og
y(a) = s2,
which from a formal point of view is also an initial value problem. This is quite confusing! Formally
the deﬁnition is OK; but in practice one should always demand that both boundary points a and b
should enter the boundary conditions at least once, when we consider boundary value problem. ♦
Remark 5.7 By practical applications we are not at all interested in boundary value problems; rather
in the closely connected eigenvalue problems. For that reason we continue with the eigenvalue problems
in the next section without giving further examples of the boundary value problem. ♦

The eigenvalue problem
The most common form of the eigenvalue problem is derived from the boundary value problem.
Deﬁnition 5.2 Eigenvalue problem I. Consider the following boundary value problem in [a, b],
dny
dxn + an−1
dn−1y
dxn−1 + · · · + a1
dy
dx + a0 y

+ λ
dpy
dxp + bp−1
dp−1y
dxp−1 + · · · + b0 y

= 0
with m linear homogeneous boundary conditions, i.e.
ri,1y(a) + · · · + ˜ri,1y(b) + · · · = 0
for i = 1, . . . , m.
Find the values of the parameter λ, for which this problem has non-trivial solutions
yλ(x).
The given solutions λ are called eigenvalues with the corresponding eigenfunctions yλ(x).
Remark 5.8 The diﬀerences from the general boundary value problem are
1) We put q(x) ≡0 and s1 = s2 = · · · = sm = 0.
2) It is the parameter λ, which ﬁrst is the unknown.
In the solution we get additional the cor-
responding eigenfunctions uλ(x) = 0, which often in the applications can be given a physical
interpretation.
3) The eigenspace {c uλ(x) | c ∈R} is usually of dimension 1 with a conveniently chosen eigenfunction
uλ(x) as its basis vector. One is often careless about this and write instead that uλ(x) is the
eigenfunction, where we tacitly mean that c · uλ(x) for c = 0 is also a eigenfunction.
Occasionally we can have eigenspaces of a higher dimension. I have in another application seen
eigenspaces of dimension 2, i.e. all eigenfunctions belonging to some eigenvalue λ are of the form
c1u1,λ(x) + c2u2,λ(x),
c1, c2 ∈R,
where u1,λ(x) and u2,λ(x) are linear independent. Such eigenspaces are diﬃcult to handle, so they
are also avoided in the elementary courses. One cannot exclude eigenspaces of dimension ≥3, but
I have never seen any in the applications. ♦
Remark 5.9 The formulation of the eigenvalue problem I assumes that the interval [a, b] is ﬁxed.
This deﬁnition is too narrow, and it is in fact easy to ﬁnd an eigenvalue problem, which is not of this
type, e.g. when the interval [0, λ] depends on the eigenvalue λ. I call such problems rather vaguely
eigenvalue problems of type II. They are diﬃcult to deﬁne mathematically though they intuitively are
obvious eigenvalue problems if we stick to that the task is to determine the values of the parameter λ,
for which the boundary value problem has non-trivial solutions. ♦

Examples
In this section we go through some examples of eigenvalue problems, mainly based on examples from
textbooks. The general procedure is
1) First determine the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation, typically based on the ﬁrst
sections of this chapter, as well as more advanced theorems, when the coeﬃcients are variable.

2) Insert the boundary conditions and reduce.
3) Determine the values of the parameter λ, for which at least one of the arbitrary constants in the
complete solution can be chosen freely. Then these λ are the eigenvalues.
4) Insert the eigenvalues λ from above in order to identify the eigenfunctions.
Example 5.2 (The original eigenvalue problem). Consider the eigenvalue problem
(25)





d2y
dx2 + λ y = 0,
x ∈[0, 4],
y(0) = 0
og
y(4) = 0.
For every ﬁxed λ this is a boundary value problem of order n = 2 and with m = 2 boundary conditions.
Notice that one often in textbooks writes y(0) = y(4) = 0 for short.
Thus we have latently two
boundary conditions, namely y(0) = 0 and y(4) = 0. We shall here avoid the short version because
one may lose some information by using it.

1) First ﬁnd the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
d2y
dx2 + λ y = 0,
x ∈[0, 4],
without the boundary conditions.
the equation has constant coeﬃcients. We therefore set up the characteristic equation
R2 + λ = 0,
i.e. R2 = −λ.
Then we get the usual mess of (here) three diﬀerent cases:
a) If λ < 0, then we can write λ = −k2 for some k > 0. The characteristic equation R2 = −λ =
+k2 has the two real roots ±k, so the complete solution is
y = ˜c1ekx + ˜c2e−kx,
˜c1, ˜c2 ∈R arbitrary.
Since
ekx = cosh(kx) + sinh(kx) og e−kx = cosh(kx) −sinh(kx),
the complete solution is more conveniently written in the form
y = c1 cosh(kx) + c2 sinh(kx),
c1, c2 arbitrary.
Be aware of this trick, which always should be applied when one of the boundary points is 0.
Notice also the analogy with the trigonometric case below.
b) If λ = 0, then the characteristic equation R2 = 0 has the root R = 0 of multiplicity 2. The
complete solution is
y = c1 + c2x,
c1, c2 arbitrary.
c) If λ > 0, we write λ = k2 for some k > 0. The characteristic equation R2 = −λ = −k2 has the
two complex conjugated roots ±i k. Thus the complete solution is
y = c1 cos(kx) + c2 sin(kx),
c1, c2 arbitrary.
Notice the similarity between the structure in c) and in a). In the former case we use trigonometric
functions while in the latter case the hyperbolic functions. Notice also that b) (the “parabolic
case”) always is messy.
We have now found the complete solution in all three cases. We now proceed to the next step.
2) We shall use the boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y(4) = 0 on every of the three cases of the
complete solutions.
a) When λ = −k2 < 0, we have the complete solution
(26) y(x) = c1 cosh(kx) + c2 sinh(kx).
By insertion of x = 0 we get
y(0) = c1 · 1 + c2 · 0 = c1 = 0.

Hereby (26) is reduced to the possibility
y(x) = c2 sinh(kx).
Here we put x = 4 and we get
(27) y(4) = c2 sinh(k4) = 0.
Since sinh(k4) > 0, we must have c2 = 0. Therefore the only solution is obtained for c1 = 0
and c2 = 0, i.e. according to (26),
y(x) ≡0,
when λ = −k2 < 0.
Since we only get the zero solution, we conclude that no λ < 0 is an eigenvalue.
b) When λ = 0 we get the complete solution
y(x) = c1 + c2x.
By putting x = 0 we get
y(0) = c1 + c2 · 0 = c1 = 0,

and the set of candidates is reduced to
y(x) = c2x.
Inserting x = 4 we get
y(4) = c2 · 4 = 0,
i.e. c2 = 0, because 4 > 0.
Since both c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, we only obtain the zero solution, proving that λ = 0 is not an
eigenvalue.
c) When λ = k2 > 0 the complete solution is
y(x) = c1 cos kx + c2 sin kx.
Inserting x = 0 we get
y(0) = c1 + c2 · 0 = c1 = 0.
The candidates are then reduced to
(28) y(x) = c2 sin(kx).
Inserting x = 4 we get
(29) y(4) = c2 sin(k4) = 0.
3) We have only reached the present step in case c) above. We want non-trivial solutions of the type
(28), i.e. we want that c2 = 0. This can according to (29) only be achieved when
sin(k4) = 0,
i.e. when kn4 = nπ > 0,
n ∈N.
This gives us the possibilities:
kn = nπ
4 ,
n ∈N,
and it is seen that each of these in fact produces a solution.
The eigenvalues are then
λn = k2
n =
nπ
4
2
,
n ∈N.
4) According to (28) [with c2 = 1] an eigenfunction yn(x) corresponding to the eigenvalue λn =

yn(x) = sin(knx) = sin

Example 1.5 is the model of all eigenvalue problems. For that reason it has been described fairly
thoroughly.
Example 5.3 Consider the eigenvalue problem (21), which was used here as a motivation, se also
Krenk, p. 160 sqq.. In the mathematical formulation we have according to (21) the eigenvalue problem





d4w
dx4 + λ d2w
dx2 = 0,
x ∈[0, 4],
w(0) = 0,
w(4) = 0,
w(0) = 0,
w(4) = 0,
i.e. the order is n = 4 and we have m = 4 boundary conditions.
1) Since the equation has constant coeﬃcients, we consider the characteristic polynomial
R4 + λ R2 = R2(R2 + λ).
Formally we again must consider three cases:
a) When λ = −k2 < 0, the complete solution is
y(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cosh(kx) + c4 sinh(kx).
b) When λ = 0, we see that R = 0 is a root of multiplicity 4, hence the complete solution is
y(x) = c1 + c2x + c3x2 + c4x3.
c) When λ = k2 > 0, the complete solution is
y(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cos(kx) + c4 sin(kx).
Here we can reuse a lot from the previous example.
2) By a long and tedious analysis it is shown like in the example above that no λ ≤0 can ever be an
eigenvalue of the problem. The proof is left to the reader.
We are again left with c), i.e. λ = k2 > 0, and the candidates of the eigenfunctions are
(30) y(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cos(kx) + c4 sin(kx)
with
(31) y(x) = −k2{c3 cos(kx) + c4 sin(kx)}.
By insertion of x = 0 into (30) we get from the boundary condition that
y(0) = c1 + c3 = 0.
By insertion of x = 0 in (31) we get from the boundary condition
y(0) = −k2c3 = 0.
Since k > 0, the last equation gives c3 = 0, which put into the ﬁrst one immediately gives c1 = 0.

We have hereby narrowed the set of candidates to
(32) y(x) = c2x + c4 sin(kx)
with
(33) y(x) = −k2c4 sin(kx).
When we put x = 4 in (32), it follows from the boundary condition that
(34) y(4) = c24 + c4 sin(k4) = 0.
When we put x = 4 in (33), it follows from the boundary condition that
y(4) = −k2c4 sin(k4) = 0,
i.e.
(35) c4 sin(k4) = 0.
Finally, when (35) is inserted into (34), we get c24 = 0, from which c2 = 0.
We have now reduced the set of candidates to
(36) y(x) = c4 sin(kx).
Since we want non-trivial solutions, we must have c4 = 0. According to (35) this gives us the
condition
sin(k4) = 0,
i.e. kn4 = nπ > 0,
n ∈N,
from which kn = nπ
4 , n ∈N (the same as in the modelling example).
3) The eigenvalues are
λn = k2
n =

,
n ∈N.
4) The corresponding eigenfunctions are according to (36)
c · yn(x) = c · sin



n ∈N.
The physical interpretation of the eigenvalues is that
Pn = λnEI = k2
nEI = n2 π

2
EI,
n ∈N,
are the critical loads or (buckling loads). The smallest of these
P1 = PE =

2
EI,

is called the Euler load, for which the ideal column breaks down. ♦

That the eigenvalue problem in practice far from always gives “nice” high school solutions is seen in
the following example.
Example 5.4 Cf. Krenk, Example 3.3. Consider an ideal column with ﬁxed and simply supported
end points. We shall ﬁnd the Euler load. Let P be the variable load. We derive by the usual reductions
(cf. Krenk, p. 160, p. 164 and p. 165) that the problem can be described by the following eigenvalue
problem
(37)





d4w
dx4 + k2 d2w
dx2 = 0
where k2 = P
EI
w(0) = 0,
w(0) = 0,
w(4) = 0,
w(4) = 0,
i.e. of order n = 4 and with m = 4 boundary conditions.
We are considering a problem of compression, so we can for physical reasons immediately exclude
λ ≤0 and only consider the case λ = k2 > 0.
1) The equation is the same as before, so we reuse the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
from (37),
(38) w(x) = c1 + c2x + c3 cos kx + c4 sin kx.

2) By the insertion into the boundary conditions we shall also need
(39) w(x) = c2 −kc3 sin kx + kc4 cos kx
and
(40) w(x) = −k2{c3 cos kx + c4 sin kx}.
Putting x = 0 in (38) we get by the boundary condition
w(0) = c1 + c3 = 0,
i.e. c3 = −c1.
Putting x = 0 in (39)we get by the boundary condition
w(0) = c2 + kc4 = 0,
dvs. c2 = −kc4.
These conditions narrow the set of candidates to
(41) w(x) = c1(1 −cos kx) + c4(−kx + sin kx)
with [cf. (40)]
(42) w(x) = −k2{−c1 cos kx + c4 sin kx}.
Putting x = 4 in (41) we get by the boundary condition
(43) w(4) = c1(1 −cos k4) + c4(−k4 + sin k4) = 0.
Putting x = 4 in (42) we get by the boundary condition
w(4) = −k2{−c1 cos k4 + c4 sin k4} = 0,
i.e. since k2 = 0,
(44) −c1 cos k4 + c4 sin k4 = 0.
And then another small trick: When we subtract (44) from (43) we get the simpler equation
(45) c1 −c4k4 = 0,
dvs. c1 = c4k4,
and the set of candidates has now been restricted to
(46) w(x) = c4{k4(1 −cos kx) + (−kx + sin kx)}.
We only get non-trivial solutions by choosing c4 = 0 in (46), and it is actually possible by using this
information to ﬁddle with the solutions by repeating the investigation of (46), when e.g. c4 = 1.
We shall not, however, do this here, but instead use the standard procedure.
The problem has now been reduced to ﬁnding solutions (c1, c2) = (0, 0) to (44) and (45). Let us
set up in the usual manner of Linear Algebra where c1 and c4 are the unknowns:



−cos(k4) · c1
+
sin(k4) · c4
=
0,
1 · c1
−
k4 · c4
=
0.

The values shall be found by iteration, cf. e.g. Krenk, p. 166, or try yourself to set up a Newton-

The eigenfunctions become very complicated, cf. (46). ♦
We have now shown the most important modelling examples of eigenvalue problems. Whenever one
comes across another eigenvalue problem, these should be the ﬁrst ones to copy. For completeness we
shall here continue with a couple of more advanced eigenvalue problems.

Example 5.5 Considering eigenvalue problems of type II one can also allow the eigenvalue to enter
the boundary conditions, like in e.g.







d2y
dx2 + λ y = 0,
x ∈[0, 1],
y(0) = 0,
y(1) −f(λ)y(1) = 0,
where f(λ) is a given function in the eigenvalue λ. Since the purpose here is only to show the principles,
we shall restrain ourselves to the determination of the positive eigenvalues λ > 0.
1) Since λ > 0, the complete solution is
y(x) = c1 cos(
√
λ x) + c2 sin(
√
λ x)
where
y(x) = −c1
√
λ sin(
√
λ x) + c2
√
λ cos(
√
λ x).
2) Putting x = 0 we get from the boundary condition that
y(0) = c1 = 0,
thus the candidates can only be of the form
y(x) = c2 sin(
√
λ x).
Since we are going for non-trivial solutions, we must have c = 0. Due to the linearity it is suﬃcient
(for c2 = 1) to consider
(48) y(x) = sin(
√
λ x)
where y(x) =
√
λ · cos(
√
λ x)
and ﬁnd the λ, for which (48) is a solution.
When we put x = 1 we get from the latter boundary condition that
y(1) = f(λ)y(1) = sin(
√
λ) −f(λ)
√
λ cos(
√
λ) = 0.
Since cos(
√
λ) = 0 implies that sin(
√
λ) = 0, we must have cos(
√
λ) = 0 for any solution of this
equation. Hence we get the equivalent transcendental equation
(49) f(λ) = tan(
√
λ)
√
λ
,
λ > 0,
[possibly
√
λ f(λ) = tan(
√
λ)]
3) In order to solve (49) we ﬁrst draw the graphs of the two functions
√
λf(λ) and tan(
√
λ) to see
where we can expect the eigenvalues. Once we know approximately where the eigenvalues are
situated we proceed with iteration in order to improve the approximate values. First try Newton-
Raphson iteration, and if it fails, apply the ﬁx point theorem.
From an application point of view the example is somewhat laboured, so there is absolutely no reason
to insert speciﬁc functions f(x). The method has already been demonstrated in Krenk, Example 3.3.

Example 5.6 A more diﬃcult example is concerned with the modelling of the bending of a vertical
one-sided constrained thin column of the length λ under the impact of its own weight. This is actually
an old and misunderstood problem from an examination which never should have been given at this
stage. The problem is relevant, but it is far too diﬃcult. The corresponding eigenvalue problem is of
type II,





d4y
dx4 + (λ −x) d2y
dx2 −dy
dx = 0,
x ∈[0λ],
y(0) = 0,
y(0) = 0,
y(λ) = 0,
y(λ) = 0,
because the eigenvalue λ also enters the deﬁnition of the interval. Hence, the problem is of the same
structure as an eigenvalue problem, and yet it is not of the type, which is described by the usual
deﬁnition.
The poor students did not have the right mathematical tools for solving this problem, so they could
only – even with a lot of help – get the estimate
λ ≈
3√
2 = 1, 25992
of the ﬁrst (and critical) eigenvalue. I have later calculated this value and found
λ ≈1, 98635,
which is far from the ﬁrst estimate stated at the examination. ♦
Example 5.7 The third example is also from textbook which retrieved this example from a scientiﬁc
paper. This is actually an example of “Murphy’s Law: What can go wrong, must go very wrong!” First
the textbook does not quote the equation correctly. Then the physical dimensions of the equations
do not ﬁt at all. And ﬁnally, the problem was not solved. (It was not either in the paper.) Such an
example should never be included in a textbook of elementary Calculus.
In order to help possible readers of the textbook mentioned above I shall here brieﬂy add the following:
The correct eigenvalue problem is (after some normalization such that all the physical dimensions
disappear)
d4y
dx4 + λ

α(1 −x) −1
2(1 −x2)
 d2y
dx2 −(α −x) dy
dx −y

= 0
with the boundary conditions
y(0) = 0,
y(0) = 0,
y(0) = 0,
y(0) = 0
and α = R
4 , where R is the radius of the circle and 4 is the length of the rod.
For an unspeciﬁed α one can only set up an iteration process, which converges all right, though is not
the easiest one to perform, not even for a speciﬁed α. I used 14 pages in my draft for the iteration!
The conclusion was that the iteration cannot be performed, unless α is given as a ﬁxed number, i.e.
we cannot derive a general result, but we have to start from the very beginning for each new value of
α! Such an example cannot be used as a motivation in an elementary textbook. It will only confuse
the students. ♦

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. Others are introduced
in Calculus 1a. It is highly recommended that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by
heart.
A.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occurs very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
A.2
Powers etc.
Logarithm:
ln |xy| =
ln |x| + ln |y|,
x, y = 0,
ln

x
y
 =
ln |x| −ln |y|,
x, y = 0,
ln |xr| =
r ln |x|,
x = 0.
Power function, ﬁxed exponent:
(xy)r = xr · yr, x, y > 0
(extensions for some r),
x
y
	r
= xr
yr , x, y > 0
(extensions for some r).
Exponential, ﬁxed base:
ax · ay = ax+y,
a > 0
(extensions for some x, y),
(ax)y = axy, a > 0
(extensions for some x, y),
a−x = 1
ax , a > 0,
(extensions for some x),
n√a = a1/n, a ≥0,
n ∈N.
Square root:
√
x2 = |x|,
x ∈R.
Remark A.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

A.3
Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)} = f (x) ± g(x),
{f(x)g(x)} = f (x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) = f(x)g(x)
f (x)
f(x) + g(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)

= f (x)g(x) −f(x)g(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f (x)
g(x) −f(x)g(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f (x)
f(x) −g(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}
f(x)g(x)
= f (x)
f(x) + g(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}
f(x)/g(x)
= f (x)
f(x) −g(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f (x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))} = f (ϕ(x)) · ϕ(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.
A.4
Special derivatives.
Power like:
d
dx (xα) = α · xα−1,
for x > 0, (extensions for some α).

for x ∈R,
d

for x ∈] −1, 1 [,

d
dx Artanh x =
1
1 −x2 ,
for |x| < 1,
d
dx Arcoth x =

for |x| > 1.
Remark A.2 The derivative of the trigonometric and the hyperbolic functions are to some extent
exponential like. The derivatives of the inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions are
power like, because we include the logarithm in this class. ♦

A.5
Integration
The most obvious rules are about linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and about that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some arbitrary
constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f (x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)} dx =

f (x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement

The rule of partial integration:

f (x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark A.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days.
It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark A.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. See also Chapter 4. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x) =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ(y) dy.
Remark A.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 og ϕ(y) = 2y. ♦

dx = Arcosh x,
for x > 1,

1
√
x2 −1
dx = ln |x +

x2 −1|,
for x > 1 eller x < −1.
There is an error in the programs of the pocket calculators TI-92 and TI-89. The numerical signs are
missing. It is obvious that
√
x2 −1 < |x| so if x < −1, then x +
√
x2 −1 < 0. Since you cannot take
the logarithm of a negative number, these pocket calculators will give an error message.

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a piont P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),
.

Moivre’s formula: By expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways we get:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example A.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical appliction,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cos u · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cos u · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cos u} + i{3 sin u −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cos u,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.
♦
Addition formulæ:
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,
sin(u −v) = sin u cos v −cos u sin v,
cos(u + v) = cos u cos v −sin u sin v,
cos(u −v) = cos u cos v + sin u sin v.

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
