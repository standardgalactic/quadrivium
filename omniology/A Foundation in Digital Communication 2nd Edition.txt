Preface to the Second Edition
Without conceding a blemish in the ﬁrst edition, I think I had best come clean
and admit that I embarked on a second edition largely to adopt a more geometric
approach to the detection of signals in white Gaussian noise. Equally rigorous, yet
more intuitive, this approach is not only student-friendly, but also extends more
easily to the detection problem with random parameters and to the radar problem.
The new approach is based on the projection of white Gaussian noise onto a ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace (Section 25.15.2) and on the independence of this projec-
tion and the diﬀerence between noise and projection; see Theorem 25.15.6 and
Theorem 25.15.7. The latter theorem allows for a simple proof of the suﬃciency
of the matched-ﬁlters’ outputs without the need to deﬁne suﬃcient statistics for
continuous-time observables. The key idea is that—while the receiver cannot re-
cover the observable from its projection onto the subspace spanned by the mean
signals—it can mimic the performance of any receiver that bases its decision on
the observable using three steps (Figure 26.1 on Page 623): use local randomness
to generate an independent stochastic process whose law is equal to that of the
diﬀerence between the noise and its projection; add this stochastic process to the
projection; and feed the result to the original receiver.
But the new geometric approach was not the only impetus for a second edition.
I also wanted to increase the book’s scope. This edition contains new chapters
on the radar problem (Chapter 30), the intersymbol interference (ISI) channel
(Chapter 32), and on the mathematical preliminaries needed for its study (Chap-
ter 31). The treatment of the radar problem is fairly standard with two twists: we
characterize all achievable pairs of false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities
(pFA, pMD) and not just those that are Pareto-optimal. Moreover, we show that
when the observable has a density under both hypotheses, all achievable pairs can
be achieved using deterministic decision rules.
As to ISI channels, I adopted the classic approach of matched ﬁltering, discrete-
time noise whitening, and running the Viterbi Algorithm. I only allow (bounded-
input/bounded-output) stable whitening ﬁlters, i.e., ﬁlters whose impulse response
is absolutely summable; others often only require that the impulse response be
square summable. While my approach makes it more diﬃcult to prove the exis-
tence of whitening ﬁlters (and I do recommend that the proof be skipped), it is
conceptually much cleaner because the convolution of the noise sequence with the
impulse response exists with probability one. This results in the convolution being
associative, and therefore greatly simpliﬁes the proof that no information is lost in
the whitening process. It is also in line with the book’s philosophy of obtaining all

results sample-wise.
The chapter on ISI channels also includes Section 32.5, which treats the detec-
tion of QAM signals where—as in most practical receivers—matched ﬁltering is
not performed at the carrier frequency but after conversion to baseband (or to
an intermediate frequency). An analysis of the complex stochastic process that
results when a (real) stationary Gaussian passband stochastic process is converted
to baseband can be found in Appendix D.
In addition, some original chapters were expanded. New sections on the opera-
tional power spectral density (in Chapter 15) and a new section on conditionally
independent Gaussians and the zeros of their precision matrix (Section 23.10) are
now included.
Last but not least, I have added over a hundred new exercises. Most reinforce and
test, but some present additional results. Enjoy!

Preface to the First Edition
Claude Shannon, the father of Information Theory, described the fundamental
problem of point-to-point communications in his classic 1948 paper as “that of
reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at
another point.”
How engineers solve this problem is the subject of this book.
But unlike Shannon’s general problem, where the message can be an image, a
sound clip, or a movie, here we restrict ourselves to bits. We thus envision that
the original message is either a binary sequence to start with, or else that it was
described using bits by a device outside our control and that our job is to reproduce
the describing bits with high reliability. The issue of how images or text ﬁles are
converted eﬃciently into bits is the subject of lossy and lossless data compression
and is addressed in texts on information theory and on quantization.
The engineering solutions to the point-to-point communication problem greatly
depend on the available resources and on the channel between the points. They
typically bring together beautiful techniques from Fourier Analysis, Hilbert Spaces,
Probability Theory, and Decision Theory. The purpose of this book is to introduce
the reader to these techniques and to their interplay.
The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate stu-
dents. The key prerequisites are basic courses in Calculus, Linear Algebra, and
Probability Theory. A course in Linear Systems is a plus but not a must, because
all the results from Linear Systems that are needed for this book are summarized
in Chapters 5 and 6. But more importantly, the book requires a certain mathemat-
ical maturity and patience, because we begin with ﬁrst principles and develop the
theory before discussing its engineering applications. The book is for those who
appreciate the views along the way as much as getting to the destination; who like
to “stop and smell the roses;” and who prefer fundamentals to acronyms. I ﬁrmly
believe that those with a sound foundation can easily pick up the acronyms and
learn the jargon on the job, but that once one leaves the academic environment,
one rarely has the time or peace of mind to study fundamentals.
In the early stages of the planning of this book I took a decision that greatly
inﬂuenced the project. I decided that every key concept should be unambiguously
deﬁned; that every key result should be stated as a mathematical theorem; and that
every mathematical theorem should be correct. This, I believe, makes for a solid
foundation on which one can build with conﬁdence. But it is also a tall order. It
required that I scrutinize each “classical” result before I used it in order to be sure
that I knew what the needed qualiﬁers were, and it forced me to include background
material to which the reader may have already been exposed, because I needed the

results with all the ﬁne print. Hence Chapters 5 and 6 on Linear Systems and
Fourier Analysis. This is also partly the reason why the book is so long. When I
started out my intention was to write a much shorter book. But I found that to do
justice to the beautiful mathematics on which Digital Communications is based I
had to expand the book.
Most physical-layer communication problems are at their core of a continuous-
time nature. The transmitted physical waveforms are functions of time and not
sequences synchronized to a clock. But most solutions ﬁrst reduce the problem to a
discrete-time setting and then solve the problem in the discrete-time domain. The
reduction to discrete-time often requires great ingenuity, which I try to describe.
It is often taken for granted in courses that open with a discrete-time model from
Lecture 1. I emphasize that most communication problems are of a continuous-
time nature, and that the reduction to discrete-time is not always trivial or even
possible. For example, it is extremely diﬃcult to translate a peak-power constraint
(stating that at no epoch is the magnitude of the transmitted waveform allowed to
exceed a given constant) to a statement about the sequence that is used to represent
the waveform. Similarly, in Wireless Communications it is often very diﬃcult to
reduce the received waveform to a sequence without any loss in performance.
The quest for mathematical precision can be demanding. I have therefore tried to
precede the statement of every key theorem with its gist in plain English. Instruc-
tors may well choose to present the material in class with less rigor and direct the
students to the book for a more mathematical approach. I would rather have text-
books be more mathematical than the lectures than the other way round. Having
a rigorous textbook allows the instructor in class to discuss the intuition knowing
that the students can obtain the technical details from the book at home.
The communication problem comes with a beautiful geometric picture that I try
to emphasize.
To appreciate this picture one needs the deﬁnition of the inner
product between energy-limited signals and some of the geometry of the space of
energy-limited signals. These are therefore introduced early on in Chapters 3 and 4.
Chapters 5 and 6 cover standard material from Linear Systems. But note the early
introduction of the matched ﬁlter as a mechanism for computing inner products
in Section 5.8. Also key is Parseval’s Theorem in Section 6.2.2 which relates the
geometric pictures in the time domain and in the frequency domain.
Chapter 7 deals with passband signals and their baseband representation. We em-
phasize how the inner product between passband signals is related to the inner
product between their baseband representations. This elegant geometric relation-
ship is often lost in the haze of various trigonometric identities. While this topic is
important in wireless applications, it is not always taught in a ﬁrst course in Digital
Communications. Instructors who prefer to discuss baseband communication only
can skip Chapters 7, 9, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, and Sections 26.8, 28.5, 30.9, 31.4, 32.4,
32.5. But it would be a shame.
Chapter 8 presents the celebrated Sampling Theorem from a geometric perspective.
It is inessential to the rest of the book but is a striking example of the geometric
approach. Chapter 9 discusses the Sampling Theorem for passband signals.
Chapter 10 discusses modulation.
I have tried to motivate Linear Modulation

and Pulse Amplitude Modulation and to minimize the use of the “that’s just how
it is done” argument. The use of the Matched Filter for detecting (here in the
absence of noise) is emphasized. This also motivates the Nyquist Theory, which is
treated in Chapter 11. I stress that the motivation for the Nyquist Theory is not
to avoid intersymbol interference at the sampling points but rather to guarantee
the orthogonality of the time shifts of the pulse shape by integer multiples of the
baud period. This ultimately makes more engineering sense and leads to cleaner
mathematics: compare Theorem 11.3.2 with its corollary, Corollary 11.3.4.
The result of modulating random bits is a stochastic process, a concept which is
ﬁrst encountered in Chapter 10; formally deﬁned in Chapter 12; and revisited in
Chapters 13, 17, 25, and 31. It is an important concept in Digital Communica-
tions, and I ﬁnd it best to ﬁrst introduce man-made synthesized stochastic processes
(as the waveforms produced by an encoder when fed random bits) and only later
to introduce the nature-made stochastic processes that model noise. Stationary
discrete-time stochastic processes are introduced in Chapter 13 and their complex
counterparts in Chapter 17. These are needed for the analysis in Chapter 14 of the
power in Pulse Amplitude Modulation and for the analysis in Chapter 17 of the
power in Quadrature Amplitude Modulation. They are revisited in Chapter 31,
which presents additional results that are needed in the study of intersymbol in-
terference channels (Chapter 32).
I emphasize that power is a physical quantity that is related to the time-averaged
energy in the continuous-time transmitted power. Its relation to the power in the
discrete-time modulating sequence is a nontrivial result. In deriving this relation
I refrain from adding random timing jitters that are often poorly motivated and
that turn out to be unnecessary. (The transmitted power does not depend on the
realization of the ﬁctitious jitter.) The Power Spectral Density in Pulse Amplitude
Modulation and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation is discussed in Chapters 15
and 18. The discussion requires a deﬁnition for Power Spectral Density for non-
stationary processes (Deﬁnitions 15.3.1 and 18.4.1) and a proof that this deﬁnition
coincides with the classical deﬁnition when the process is wide-sense stationary
(Theorem 25.14.3).
Chapter 19 opens the second part of the book, which deals with noise and detection.
It introduces the univariate Gaussian distribution and some related distributions.
The principles of Detection Theory are presented in Chapters 20–22. I emphasize
the notion of Suﬃcient Statistics, which is central to Detection Theory. Building
on Chapter 19, Chapter 23 introduces the all-important multivariate Gaussian
distribution. Chapter 24 treats the complex case.
Chapter 25 deals with continuous-time stochastic processes with an emphasis on
stationary Gaussian processes, which are often used to model the noise in Digital
Communications. This chapter also introduces white Gaussian noise. My approach
to this topic is perhaps new and is probably where this text diﬀers the most from
other textbooks on the subject.
I deﬁne white Gaussian noise of double-sided power spectral density N0/2
with respect to the bandwidth W as any measurable,1 stationary, Gaussian

stochastic process whose power spectral density is a nonnegative, symmetric, inte-
grable function of frequency that is equal to N0/2 at all frequencies f satisfying
|f| ≤W. The power spectral density at other frequencies can be arbitrary. An
example of the power spectral density of such a process is depicted in Figure 1.
Adopting this deﬁnition has a number of advantages. The ﬁrst is, of course, that
such processes exist. One need not discuss “generalized processes,” Gaussian pro-
cesses with inﬁnite variances (that, by deﬁnition, do not exist), or introduce the
Itˆo calculus to study stochastic integrals. (Stochastic integrals with respect to the
Brownian motion are mathematically intricate and physically unappealing. The
idea of the noise having inﬁnite power is ludicrous.) The above deﬁnition also frees
me from discussing Dirac’s Delta, and, in fact, Dirac’s Delta is never used in this
book. (A rigorous treatment of Generalized Functions is beyond the engineering
curriculum in most schools, so using Dirac’s Delta always gives the reader the
unsettling feeling of being on unsure footing.)
The detection problem in white Gaussian noise is treated in Chapter 26. No course
in Digital Communications should end without Theorem 26.3.1. Roughly speaking,
this theorem states that if the mean-signals are bandlimited to W Hz and if the
noise is white Gaussian noise with respect to the bandwidth W, then there is no
loss of optimality in basing our guess on the projection of the received waveform
onto the subspace spanned by the mean-signals. Numerous examples as well as a
treatment of colored noise are also discussed in this chapter. Extensions to nonco-
herent detection are addressed in Chapter 27 and implications for Pulse Amplitude
Modulation and for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation in Chapter 28.
Coding is introduced in Chapter 29. It emphasizes how the code design inﬂuences
the transmitted power, the transmitted power spectral density, the required band-
(I do deﬁne sets of Lebesgue measure zero in order to be able to state uniqueness theorems.) I
use Measure Theory only in stating theorems that require measurability assumptions. This is
in line with my attempt to state theorems together with all the assumptions that are required
for their validity. I recommend that students ignore measurability issues and just make a mental
note that whenever measurability is mentioned there is a minor technical condition lurking in the
background.

width, and the probability of error. The construction of good codes is left to texts
on Coding Theory.
Motivated by the radar problem, Chapter 30 introduces the Neyman-Pearson the-
ory of hypothesis testing as well as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. And after some
mathematical preliminaries in Chapter 31, the book concludes with Chapter 32,
which introduces the intersymbol interference channel and the Viterbi Algorithm.
Basic Latin
Mathematics sometimes reads like a foreign language. I therefore include here a
short glossary for such terms as “i.e.,” “that is,” “in particular,” “a fortiori,” “for
example,” and “e.g.,” whose meaning in Mathematics is slightly diﬀerent from the
deﬁnition you will ﬁnd in your English dictionary. In mathematical contexts these
terms are actually logical statements that the reader should verify. Verifying these
statements is an important way to make sure that you understand the math.
What are these logical statements? First note the synonym “i.e.” = “that is” and
the synonym “e.g.” = “for example.” Next note that the term “that is” often
indicates that the statement following the term is equivalent to the one preceding
it: “We next show that p is a prime, i.e., that p is a positive integer larger than
one that is not divisible by any positive integer other than one and itself.” The
terms “in particular” or “a fortiori” indicate that the statement following them
is implied by the one preceding them: “Since g(·) is diﬀerentiable and, a fortiori,
continuous, it follows from the Mean Value Theorem that the integral of g(·) over
the interval [0, 1] is equal to g(ξ) for some ξ ∈[0, 1].” The term “for example” can
have its regular day-to-day meaning but in mathematical writing it also sometimes
indicates that the statement following it implies the one preceding it: “Suppose
that the function g(·) is monotonically nondecreasing, e.g., that it is diﬀerentiable
with a nonnegative derivative.”
Another important word to look out for is “indeed,” which in this book typically
signiﬁes that the statement just made is about to be expanded upon and explained.
So when you read something that is unclear to you, be sure to check whether the
next sentence begins with the word “indeed” before you panic.
The Latin phrases “a priori” and “a posteriori” show up in Probability Theory.
The former is usually associated with the unconditional probability of an event and
the latter with the conditional. Thus, the “a priori” probability that the sun will
shine this Sunday in Zurich is 25%, but now that I know that it is raining today,
my outlook on life changes and I assign this event the a posteriori probability of
15%.
The phrase “prima facie” is roughly equivalent to the phrase “before any further
mathematical arguments have been presented.” For example, the deﬁnition of the
projection of a signal v onto the signal u as the vector w that is collinear with u and
for which v−w is orthogonal to u, may be followed by the sentence: “Prima facie,
it is not clear that the projection always exists and that it is unique. Nevertheless,
as we next show, this is the case.”

The book can be used as a textbook for a number of diﬀerent courses. For a course
that focuses on deterministic signals one could use Chapters 1–9 and Chapter 11.
A course that covers Stochastic Processes and Detection Theory could be based
on Chapter 12, Chapters 19–26, and Chapter 30 with or without discrete-time
stochastic processes (Chapters 13 and 31) and with or without complex random
variables and processes (Chapters 17 and 24).
For a course on Digital Communications one could use the entire book or, if time
does not permit it, discuss only baseband communication. In the latter case one
could omit Chapters 7, 9, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, and Sections 26.8, 28.5, 30.9, 31.4,
32.4, 32.5.

Chapter 1
Some Essential Notation
Reading a whole chapter about notation can be boring. We have thus chosen to
collect here only the essentials and to introduce the rest when it is ﬁrst used. The
“List of Symbols” on Page 866 is more comprehensive.
We denote the set of complex numbers by C, the set of real numbers by R, the set
of integers by Z, and the set of natural numbers (positive integers) by N. Thus,
N = {n ∈Z : n ≥1}.
The above equation is not meant to belabor the point. We use it to introduce the
notation
{x ∈A : statement}
for the set consisting of all those elements of the set A for which “statement” holds.
In treating real numbers, we use the notation (a, b), [a, b), [a, b], (a, b] to denote
open, half open on the right, closed, and half open on the left intervals of the real
line. Thus, for example,
[a, b) = {x ∈R : a ≤x < b}.
A statement followed by a comma and a condition indicates that the statement
holds whenever the condition is satisﬁed. For example,
|an −a| < ϵ,
n ≥n0
means that |an −a| < ϵ whenever n ≥n0.
We use I{statement} to denote the indicator of the statement. It is equal to 1, if
the statement is true, and it is equal to 0, if the statement is false. Thus
I{statement} =

1
if statement is true,
0
if statement is false.
In dealing with complex numbers we use i to denote the purely imaginary complex
number whose imaginary part is one
i =
√
−1.

Some Essential Notation
We use z∗to denote the complex conjugate of z, we use Re(z) to denote the real
part of z, we use Im(z) to denote the imaginary part of z, and we use |z| to denote
the absolute value (or “modulus”, or “complex magnitude”) of z. Thus, if z = a+ib,
where a, b ∈R, then z∗= a −ib, Re(z) = a, Im(z) = b, and |z| =
√
a2 + b2.
The notation used to deﬁne functions is extremely important and is, alas, some-
times confusing to students, so please pay attention. A function or a mapping
associates with each element in its domain a unique element in its codomain. If
a function has a name, the name is often written in bold as in u.1 Alternatively,
we sometimes denote a function u by u(·). The notation
u: A →B
indicates that u is a function of domain A and codomain B. The rule specifying
for each element of the domain the element in the codomain to which it is mapped
is often written to the right or underneath. Thus, for example,
u: R →(−5, ∞),
t 	→t2
indicates that the domain of the function u is the reals, that its codomain is the
set of real numbers that exceed −5, and that u associates with t the nonnegative
number t2. We write u(t) for the result of applying the mapping u to t. The range
of a mapping u: A →B is the set of all elements of the codomain B to which at
least one element in the domain is mapped by u:
range of

u: A →B

=

u(x) : x ∈A

.
(1.1)
The range of a mapping is a subset of its codomain. In the above example, the
range of the mapping is the set of nonnegative reals [0, ∞). A mapping u: A →B
is said to be onto (or surjective) if its range is equal to its codomain. Thus,
u: A →B is onto if, and only if, for every y ∈B there corresponds some x ∈A
(not necessarily unique) such that u(x) = y. If the range of g(·) is a subset of the
domain of h(·), then the composition of g(·) and h(·) is the mapping x 	→h

g(x)

,
which is denoted by h ◦g. A function u: A →B is said to be one-to-one (or
injective) if diﬀerent elements of A are mapped to diﬀerent elements of B, i.e., if
x1 ̸= x2 implies that u(x1) ̸= u(x2) (whenever x1, x2 ∈A).
Sometimes we do not specify the domain and codomain of a function if they are
clear from the context.
Thus, we might write u: t 	→v(t) cos(2πfct) without
making explicit what the domain and codomain of u are. In fact, if there is no
need to give a function a name, then we will not. For example, we might write t 	→
v(t) cos(2πfct) to designate the unnamed function that maps t to v(t) cos(2πfct).
(Here v(·) is some other function, which was presumably deﬁned before.)
If the domain of a function u is R and if the codomain is R, then we sometimes say
that u is a real-valued signal or a real signal, especially if the argument of u
stands for time. Similarly we shall sometimes refer to a function u: R →C as a
complex-valued signal or a complex signal. If we refer to u as a signal, then
1But some special functions such as the self-similarity function Rgg, the autocovariance func-
tion KXX, and the power spectral density SXX, which will be introduced in later chapters, are
not in boldface.

the question whether it is complex-valued or real-valued should be clear from the
context, or else immaterial to the claim.
We caution the reader that, while u and u(·) denote functions, u(t) denotes the
result of applying u to t. If u is a real-valued signal then u(t) is a real number!
Given two signals u and v we deﬁne their superposition or sum as the signal
t 	→u(t) + v(t). We denote this signal by u + v. Also, if α ∈C and u is any signal,
then we deﬁne the ampliﬁcation of u by α as the signal t 	→α u(t). We denote
this signal by α u. Thus,
α u + β v
is the signal
t 	→α u(t) + β v(t).
We refer to the function that maps every element in its domain to zero as the all-
zero function and we denote it by 0. The all-zero signal 0 maps every t ∈R
to zero. If x: R →C is a signal that maps every t ∈R to x(t), then its reﬂection
or mirror image is denoted by ~x and is the signal that is deﬁned by
~x: t 	→x(−t).
Dirac’s Delta (which will hardly be mentioned in this book) is not a function.
A probability space is deﬁned as a triple (Ω, F, P), where the set Ω is the set of
experiment outcomes, the elements of the set F are subsets of Ω and are called
events, and where P : F →[0, 1] assigns probabilities to the various events. It is
assumed that F forms a σ-algebra, i.e., that Ω ∈F; that if a set is in F then so
is its complement (with respect to Ω); and that every ﬁnite or countable union of
elements of F is also an element of F. A random variable (RV) X is a mapping
from Ω to R that satisﬁes the technical condition that
{ω ∈Ω : X(ω) ≤ξ} ∈F,
ξ ∈R.
(1.2)
This condition guarantees that it is always meaningful to evaluate the probability
that the value of X is smaller or equal to ξ.

Chapter 2
Signals, Integrals, and Sets of Measure Zero
2.1
Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is not to develop the Lebesgue theory of integration.
Mastering this theory is not essential to understanding Digital Communications.
But some concepts from this theory are needed in order to state the main results
of Digital Communications in a mathematically rigorous way.
In this chapter
we introduce these required concepts and provide references to the mathematical
literature that develops them.
The less mathematically-inclined may gloss over most of this chapter. Readers
who interpret the integrals in this book as Riemann integrals; who interpret “mea-
surable” as “satisfying a minor mathematical restriction”; who interpret “a set of
Lebesgue measure zero” as “a set that is so small that integrals of functions are
insensitive to the values the integrand takes in this set”; and who swap orders of
summations, expectations and integrations fearlessly will not miss any engineering
insights.
But all readers should pay attention to the way the integral of complex-valued
signals is deﬁned (Section 2.3); to the basic inequality (2.13); and to the notation
introduced in (2.6).

Integrals

denoted by

For (2.1) to be meaningful some technical conditions must be met. (You may re-
call from your calculus studies, for example, that not every function is Riemann
integrable.) In this book all integrals will be understood to be Lebesgue integrals,
but nothing essential will be lost on readers who interpret them as Riemann inte-
grals. For the Lebesgue integral to be deﬁned the integrand u must be a Lebesgue
measurable function. Again, do not worry if you have not studied the Lebesgue
integral or the notion of measurable functions. We point this out merely to cover
ourselves when we state various theorems. Also, for the integral in (2.1) to be

(2.2)
(There are ways of deﬁning the integral in (2.1) also when (2.2) is violated, but
they lead to fragile expressions that are diﬃcult to manipulate.)
A function u: R →R which is Lebesgue measurable and which satisﬁes (2.2) is
said to be integrable, and we denote the set of all such functions by L1. We shall
refrain from integrating functions that are not elements of L1.
2.3
Integrating Complex-Valued Signals
This section should assuage your fear of integrating complex-valued signals. (Some
of you may have a trauma from your Complex Analysis courses where you dealt
with integrals of functions from the complex plane to the complex plane. Here
things are much simpler because we are dealing only with integrals of functions
from the real line to the complex plane.)
We formally deﬁne the integral of a
complex-valued function u: R →C by
 ∞

u(t) dt ≜

u(t)


(2.3)
For this to be meaningful, we require that the real functions t 	→Re

u(t)

and
t 	→Im

u(t)

both be integrable real functions.
That is, they should both be
Lebesgue measurable and we should have

and
 ∞

It is not diﬃcult to show that (2.4) is equivalent to the more compact condition
 ∞

u(t)

(2.5)
We say that a complex signal u: R →C is Lebesgue measurable if the mappings
t 	→Re

u(t)

and t 	→Im

u(t)

are Lebesgue measurable real signals. We say that
a function u: R →C is integrable if it is Lebesgue measurable and (2.4) holds.
The set of all Lebesgue measurable integrable complex signals is denoted by L1.
Note that we use the same symbol L1 to denote both the set of integrable real
signals and the set of integrable complex signals. To which of these two sets we
refer should be clear from the context, or else immaterial.
For u ∈L1 we deﬁne ∥u∥1 as

Signals, Integrals, and Sets of Measure Zero
Before summarizing the key properties of the integral of complex signals we remind
the reader that if u and v are complex signals and if α, β are complex numbers, then
the complex signal α u+β v is deﬁned as the complex signal t 	→α u(t)+β v(t). The
intuition for the following proposition comes from thinking about the integrals as
Riemann integrals, which can be approximated by ﬁnite sums and by then invoking
the analogous results about ﬁnite sums.
Proposition 2.3.1 (Properties of Complex Integrals). Let the complex signals u, v
be in L1, and let α, β be arbitrary complex numbers.

of the claims follow easily from the deﬁnition of the integral of a complex-valued
signal (2.3).

Another simple but useful inequality is

2.5
Sets of Lebesgue Measure Zero
It is one of life’s minor grievances that the integral of a nonnegative function can
be zero even if the function is not identically zero. For example, t 	→I{t = 17} is a
nonnegative function whose integral is zero and which is nonetheless not identically
zero (it maps 17 to one). In this section we shall derive a necessary and suﬃcient
condition for the integral of a nonzero function to be zero. This condition will
allow us later to state conditions under which various integral inequalities hold
with equality. It will give mathematical meaning to the physical intuition that if
the waveform describing some physical phenomenon (such as voltage over a resistor)
is nonnegative and integrates to zero then “for all practical purposes” the waveform
is zero.
We shall deﬁne sets of Lebesgue measure zero and then show that a nonnegative
function u: R →[0, ∞) integrates to zero if, and only if, the set {t ∈R : u(t) > 0} is
of Lebesgue measure zero. Thus, whether or not a nonnegative function integrates
to zero depends on the set over which it takes on positive values and not on the
actual values. We shall then introduce the notation u ≡v to indicate that the set
{t ∈R : u(t) ̸= v(t)} is of Lebesgue measure zero.
It should be noted that since the integral is unaltered when the integrand is changed
at a ﬁnite (or countable) number of points, it follows that any nonnegative function

Signals, Integrals, and Sets of Measure Zero
that is zero except at a countable number of points integrates to zero. The reverse,
however, is not true. One can ﬁnd nonnegative functions that integrate to zero
and that are nonzero on an uncountable set of points.
The less mathematically inclined readers may skip the mathematical deﬁnition of
sets of measure zero and just think of a subset of the real line as being of Lebesgue
measure zero if it is so “small” that the integral of any function is unaltered when
the values it takes in the subset are altered. Such readers should then think of the
statement u ≡v as indicating that u −v is just the result of altering the all-zero
signal 0 on a set of Lebesgue measure zero and that, consequently,
 ∞
−∞
|u(t) −v(t)| dt = 0.
Deﬁnition 2.5.1 (Sets of Lebesgue Measure Zero). We say that a subset N of
the real line R is a set of Lebesgue measure zero (or a Lebesgue null set)
if for every ϵ > 0 we can ﬁnd a sequence of intervals [a1, b1], [a2, b2], . . . such that
the total length of the intervals is smaller than or equal to ϵ
∞

j=1
(bj −aj) ≤ϵ
(2.15a)
and such that the union of the intervals covers N
N ⊆[a1, b1] ∪[a2, b2] ∪· · · .
(2.15b)
As an example, note that the set {1} is of Lebesgue measure zero. Indeed, it is
covered by the single interval [1 −ϵ/2, 1 + ϵ/2] whose length is ϵ. Similarly, any
ﬁnite set is of Lebesgue measure zero. Indeed, the set {α1, . . . , αn} can be covered
by n intervals of total length not exceeding ϵ as follows:
{α1, . . . , αn} ⊂

α1 −ϵ/(2n), α1 + ϵ/(2n)

∪· · · ∪

αn −ϵ/(2n), αn + ϵ/(2n)

.
This argument can be also extended to show that any countable set is of Lebesgue
measure zero. Indeed the countable set {α1, α2, . . .} can be covered as
{α1, α2, . . .} ⊆
∞

j=1

αj −2−j−1ϵ, αj + 2−j−1ϵ

where we note that the length of the interval

αj −2−j−1ϵ, αj + 2−j−1ϵ

is 2−jϵ,
which when summed over j yields ϵ.
With a similar argument one can show that the union of a countable number of
sets of Lebesgue measure zero is of Lebesgue measure zero.
The above examples notwithstanding, it should be emphasized that there exist sets
of Lebesgue measure zero that are not countable.1 Thus, the concept of a set of
Lebesgue measure zero is diﬀerent from the concept of a countable set.
1For example, the Cantor set is of Lebesgue measure zero and uncountable; see (Rudin, 1976,
Section 11.11, Remark (f), p. 309).

2.5 Sets of Lebesgue Measure Zero
9
Loosely speaking, we say that two signals are indistinguishable if they agree except
possibly on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. We warn the reader, however, that
this terminology is not standard.
Deﬁnition 2.5.2 (Indistinguishable Functions). We say that the Lebesgue measur-
able functions u, v from R to C (or to R) are indistinguishable and write
u ≡v
if the set {t ∈R : u(t) ̸= v(t)} is of Lebesgue measure zero.
Note that u ≡v if, and only if, the signal u −v is indistinguishable from the
all-zero signal 0

u ≡v

⇐⇒

u −v ≡0

.
(2.16)
The main result of this section is the following:
Proposition 2.5.3.
(i) A nonnegative Lebesgue measurable signal integrates to zero if, and only if,
it is indistinguishable from the all-zero signal 0.
(ii) If u, v are Lebesgue measurable functions from R to C (or to R), then
  ∞

|u(t) −v(t)| dt = 0

⇐⇒

and
  ∞

|u(t) −v(t)|2 dt = 0

⇐⇒

u ≡v

.
(2.18)
(iii) If u and v are integrable and indistinguishable, then their integrals are equal:

u ≡v

=⇒
  ∞
−∞
u(t) dt =
 ∞
−∞
v(t) dt

,
u, v ∈L1.
(2.19)
Proof. The proof of (i) is not very diﬃcult, but it requires more familiarity with
Measure Theory than we are willing to assume.
The interested reader is thus
referred to (Rudin, 1987, Theorem 1.39).
The equivalence in (2.17) follows by applying Part (i) to the nonnegative function
t 	→|u(t) −v(t)|. Similarly, (2.18) follows by applying Part (i) to the nonnegative
function t 	→|u(t)−v(t)|2 and by noting that the set of t’s for which |u(t)−v(t)|2 ̸= 0
is the same as the set of t’s for which u(t) ̸= v(t).
Part (iii) follows from (2.17) by noting that

These changes of order are usually justiﬁed using Fubini’s Theorem, which states
that these changes of order are permissible provided that a very technical measura-
bility condition is satisﬁed and that, in addition, either the integrand is nonnegative
or that in some order (and hence in all orders) the integrals/summation/expectation
of the absolute value of the integrand is ﬁnite.
For example, to justify (2.20) it suﬃces to verify that the function u: R2 →R in
(2.20) is Lebesgue measurable and that, in addition, it is either nonnegative or
 ∞

or

(No need to worry about measurability which is automatic in this setup.)

The Inner Product
3.1
The Inner Product
The inner product is central to Digital Communications, so it is best to introduce
it early. The motivation will have to wait.
Recall that u: A →B indicates that u (sometimes denoted u(·)) is a function
(or mapping) that maps each element in its domain A to an element in its
codomain B.
If both the domain and the codomain of u are the set of real
numbers R, then we sometimes refer to u as being a real signal, especially if the
argument of u(·) stands for time. Similarly, if u: R →C where C denotes the set
of complex numbers and the argument of u(·) stands for time, then we sometimes
refer to u as a complex signal.
The inner product between two real functions u: R →R and v: R →R is
denoted ⟨u, v⟩and is deﬁned as
⟨u, v⟩≜
 ∞
−∞
u(t) v(t) dt,
(3.1)
whenever the integral is deﬁned.1(In Section 3.2 we shall study conditions under
which the integral is deﬁned, i.e., conditions on the functions u and v that guar-
antee that the product function t 	→u(t) v(t) is an integrable function.)
The signals that arise in our study of Digital Communications often represent
electric ﬁelds or voltages over resistors. The energy required to generate them is
thus proportional to the integral of their squared magnitude. This motivates us to
deﬁne the energy of a Lebesgue measurable real-valued function u: R →R as
 ∞
−∞
u2(t) dt.
(If this integral is not ﬁnite, then we say that u is of inﬁnite energy.) We say that
u: R →R is of ﬁnite energy if it is Lebesgue measurable and if
 ∞
−∞
u2(t) dt < ∞.

this term for inner product spaces.

3.1 The Inner Product
15
The class of all ﬁnite-energy real-valued functions u: R →R is denoted by L2.
Since the energy of u: R →R is nonnegative, we can discuss its nonnegative square
root, which we denote2 by ∥u∥2:
∥u∥2 ≜
 ∞
−∞
u2(t) dt.
(3.2)
(Throughout this book we denote by √ξ the nonnegative square root of ξ for every
ξ ≥0.) We can now express the energy in u using the inner product as
∥u∥2
2 =
 ∞
−∞
u2(t) dt
= ⟨u, u⟩.
(3.3)
In writing ∥u∥2
2 above we used diﬀerent fonts for the subscript and the superscript.
The subscript is just a graphical character which is part of the notation ∥·∥2. We
could have replaced it with ♦and designated the energy by ∥u∥2
♦without any
change in mathematical meaning.3 The superscript, however, indicates that the
quantity ∥u∥2 is being squared.
For complex-valued functions u: R →C and v: R →C we deﬁne the inner product
⟨u, v⟩as
⟨u, v⟩≜
 ∞
−∞
u(t) v∗(t) dt,
(3.4)
whenever the integral is deﬁned. Here v∗(t) denotes the complex conjugate of v(t).
The above integral in (3.4) is a complex integral, but that should not worry you:
it can also be written as
⟨u, v⟩=
 ∞
−∞
Re

u(t) v∗(t)

dt + i
 ∞
−∞
Im

u(t) v∗(t)

dt,
(3.5)
where i = √−1 and where Re(·) and Im(·) denote the functions that map a complex
number to its real and imaginary parts: Re(a+ib) = a and Im(a+ib) = b whenever
a, b ∈R. Each of the two integrals appearing in (3.5) is the integral of a real signal.
See Section 2.3.
Note that (3.1) and (3.4) are in agreement in the sense that if u and v happen
to take on only real values (i.e., satisfy that u(t), v(t) ∈R for every t ∈R), then
viewing them as real functions and thus using (3.1) would yield the same inner
product as viewing them as (degenerate) complex functions and using (3.4). Note
also that for complex functions u, v: R →C the inner product ⟨u, v⟩is in general
not the same as ⟨v, u⟩. One is the complex conjugate of the other.
2The subscript 2 is here to distinguish ∥u∥2 from ∥u∥1 , where the latter was deﬁned in (2.6)
as ∥u∥1 =
 ∞
−∞|u(t)| dt.
3We prefer ∥·∥2 to ∥·∥♦because it reminds us that in the deﬁnition (3.2) the integrand is
raised to the second power. This should be contrasted with the symbol ∥·∥1 where the magnitude
of the integrand is raised to the ﬁrst power (and where no square root is taken of the result); see
(2.6).

The Inner Product
Some of the properties of the inner product between complex-valued functions
u, v: R →C are given below.
⟨u, v⟩= ⟨v, u⟩∗
(3.6)
⟨α u, v⟩= α ⟨u, v⟩,
α ∈C
(3.7)
⟨u, α v⟩= α∗⟨u, v⟩,
α ∈C
(3.8)
⟨u1 + u2, v⟩= ⟨u1, v⟩+ ⟨u2, v⟩
(3.9)
⟨u, v1 + v2⟩= ⟨u, v1⟩+ ⟨u, v2⟩.
(3.10)
The above equalities hold whenever the inner products appearing on the right-
hand side (RHS) are deﬁned. The reader is encouraged to produce a similar list of
properties for the inner product between real-valued functions u, v: R →R.
The energy in a Lebesgue measurable complex-valued function u: R →C is de-
ﬁned as
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
2 dt,
where |·| denotes absolute value so |a + ib| =
√
a2 + b2 whenever a, b ∈R. This
deﬁnition of energy might seem a bit contrived because there is no such thing
as complex voltage, so prima facie it seems meaningless to deﬁne the energy of
a complex signal. But this is not the case. Complex signals are used to repre-
sent real passband signals, and the representation is such that the energy in the
real passband signal is proportional to the integral of the squared modulus of the
complex-valued signal representing it; see Section 7.6 ahead.
Deﬁnition 3.1.1 (Energy-Limited Signal). We say that u: R →C is energy-
limited or of ﬁnite energy if u is Lebesgue measurable and
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
2 dt < ∞.
The set of all energy-limited complex-valued functions u: R →C is denoted L2.
Note that whether L2 stands for the class of energy-limited complex-valued or
real-valued functions should be clear from the context, or else immaterial.
For every u ∈L2 we deﬁne ∥u∥2 as the nonnegative square root of its energy
∥u∥2 ≜

⟨u, u⟩,
(3.11)
so
∥u∥2 =
 ∞
−∞
|u(t)|2 dt.
(3.12)
Again (3.12) and (3.2) are in agreement in the sense that for every u: R →R,
computing ∥u∥2 via (3.2) yields the same result as if we viewed u as mapping
from R to C and computed ∥u∥2 via (3.12).

3.2 When Is the Inner Product Deﬁned?

3.2
When Is the Inner Product Deﬁned?
As noted in Section 2.2, in this book we shall only discuss the integral of integrable
functions, where a function u: R →R is integrable if it is Lebesgue measurable
and if
 ∞
−∞|u(t)| dt < ∞. (We shall sometimes make an exception for functions
that take on only nonnegative values. If u: R →[0, ∞) is Lebesgue measurable
and if

u(t) dt is not ﬁnite, then we shall say that

u(t) dt = +∞.)
Similarly, as in Section 2.3, in integrating complex signals u: R →C we limit
ourselves to signals that are integrable in the sense that both t 	→Re

u(t)

and
t 	→Im

u(t)

are Lebesgue measurable real-valued signals and
 ∞
−∞|u(t)| dt < ∞.
Consequently, we shall say that the inner product between u: R →C and v: R →C
is well-deﬁned only when they are both Lebesgue measurable (thus implying that
t 	→u(t) v∗(t) is Lebesgue measurable) and when
 ∞
−∞
u(t) v(t)
 dt < ∞.
(3.13)
We next discuss conditions on the Lebesgue measurable complex signals u and v
that guarantee that (3.13) holds. The simplest case is when one of the functions,
say u, is bounded and the other, say v, is integrable. Indeed, if σ∞∈R is such
that |u(t)| ≤σ∞for all t ∈R, then |u(t) v(t)| ≤σ∞|v(t)| and
 ∞
−∞
u(t) v(t)
 dt ≤σ∞
 ∞
−∞
v(t)
 dt = σ∞∥v∥1 ,
where the RHS is ﬁnite by our assumption that v is integrable.
Another case where the inner product is well-deﬁned is when both u and v are of
ﬁnite energy. To prove that in this case too the mapping t 	→u(t) v(t) is integrable
we need the inequality
α β ≤1
2(α2 + β2),
α, β ∈R,
(3.14)
which follows directly from the inequality (α −β)2 ≥0 by simple algebra:
0 ≤(α −β)2
= α2 + β2 −2αβ.
By substituting |u(t)| for α and |v(t)| for β in (3.14) we obtain the inequality
|u(t) v(t)| ≤(|u(t)|2 + |v(t)|2)/2 and hence
 ∞
−∞
u(t) v(t)
 dt ≤1
2
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
2 dt + 1
2
 ∞
−∞
v(t)
2 dt,
(3.15)
thus demonstrating that if both u and v are of ﬁnite energy (so the RHS is ﬁnite),
then the inner product is well-deﬁned, i.e., t 	→u(t) v(t) is integrable.
As a by-product of this proof we can obtain an upper bound on the magnitude of
the inner product in terms of the energies of u and v. All we need is the inequality

(3.16)
This inequality will be improved in Theorem 3.3.1, which introduces the Cauchy-
Schwarz Inequality.
We ﬁnally mention here, without proof, a third case where the inner product
between the Lebesgue measurable signals u, v is deﬁned. The result here is that if
for some numbers 1 < p, q < ∞satisfying 1/p + 1/q = 1 we have that
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
p dt < ∞
and
 ∞
−∞
v(t)
q dt < ∞,
then t 	→u(t) v(t) is integrable. The proof of this result follows from H¨older’s
Inequality (Theorem 3.3.2 ahead). Notice that the second case we addressed (where
u and v are both of ﬁnite energy) follows from this case by considering p = q = 2.
3.3
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is probably the most important inequality on the
inner product. Its discrete version is attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–
1857) and its integral form to Victor Yacovlevich Bunyakovsky (1804–1889) who
studied with him in Paris. Its (double) integral form was derived independently by
Hermann Amandus Schwarz (1843–1921). See (Steele, 2004, pp. 10–12) for more
on the history of this inequality and on how inequalities get their names.
Theorem 3.3.1 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality). If the functions u, v: R →C are
of ﬁnite energy, then the mapping t 	→u(t) v∗(t) is integrable and
⟨u, v⟩
 ≤∥u∥2 ∥v∥2 .
(3.17)
That is,


u(t) v∗(t) dt
 ≤
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
2 dt
 ∞
−∞
v(t)
2 dt.
Equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is possible, e.g., if u is a scaled version
of v, i.e., if for some constant α
u(t) = α v(t),
t ∈R.

3.3 The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
19
In fact, the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality holds with equality if, and only if, either v(t)
is zero for all t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero or for some constant α we
have u(t) = α v(t) for all t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
There are a number of diﬀerent proofs of this important inequality. We shall focus
here on one that is based on (3.16) because it demonstrates a general technique for
improving inequalities. The idea is that once one obtains a certain inequality—in
our case (3.16)—one can try to improve it by taking advantage of one’s under-
standing of how the quantity in question is aﬀected by various transformations.
This technique is beautifully illustrated in (Steele, 2004).
Proof. The quantity in question is |⟨u, v⟩|. We shall take advantage of our under-
standing of how this quantity behaves when we replace u with its scaled version
α u and when we replace v with its scaled version β v. Here α, β ∈C are arbitrary.
The quantity in question transforms as
|⟨α u, β v⟩| = |α| |β| |⟨u, v⟩|.
(3.18)
We now use (3.16) to upper-bound the left-hand side (LHS) of the above by sub-
stituting α u and β v for u and v in (3.16) to obtain
|α| |β| |⟨u, v⟩| = |⟨α u, β v⟩|
≤1
2|α|2 ∥u∥2
2 + 1
2|β|2 ∥v∥2
2 ,
α, β ∈C.
(3.19)
If both ∥u∥2 and ∥v∥2 are positive, then (3.17) follows from (3.19) by choosing
α = 1/ ∥u∥2 and β = 1/ ∥v∥2. To conclude the proof it thus remains to show that
(3.17) also holds when either ∥u∥2 or ∥v∥2 is zero so the RHS of (3.17) is zero.
That is, we need to show that if either ∥u∥2 or ∥v∥2 is zero, then ⟨u, v⟩must also
be zero. To show this, suppose ﬁrst that ∥u∥2 is zero. By substituting α = 1 in
(3.19) we obtain in this case that
|β| |⟨u, v⟩| ≤1
2|β|2 ∥v∥2
2 ,
which, upon dividing by |β|, yields
|⟨u, v⟩| ≤1
2|β| ∥v∥2
2 ,
β ̸= 0.
Upon letting |β| tend to zero from above this demonstrates that ⟨u, v⟩must be zero
as we set out to prove. (As an alternative proof of this case one notes that ∥u∥2 = 0
implies, by Proposition 2.5.3, that the set {t ∈R : u(t) ̸= 0} is of Lebesgue measure
zero. Consequently, since every zero of t 	→u(t) is also a zero of t 	→u(t) v∗(t),
it follows that {t ∈R : u(t) v∗(t) ̸= 0} is included in {t ∈R : u(t) ̸= 0}, and
must therefore also be of Lebesgue measure zero (Exercise 2.10). Consequently,
by Proposition 2.5.3,
 ∞
−∞|u(t) v∗(t)| dt must be zero, which, by Proposition 2.4.1,
implies that |⟨u, v⟩| must be zero.)
The case where ∥v∥2 = 0 is very similar: by substituting β = 1 in (3.19) we obtain
that (in this case)
|⟨u, v⟩| ≤1
2|α| ∥u∥2
2 ,
α ̸= 0

and the result follows upon letting |α| tend to zero from above.
While we shall not use the following inequality in this book, it is suﬃciently im-
portant that we mention it in passing.
Theorem 3.3.2 (H¨older’s Inequality). If u: R →C and v: R →C are Lebesgue

Note that the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality corresponds to the case where p = q = 2.
Proof. See, for example, (Rudin, 1987, Theorem 3.5) or (Royden and Fitzpatrick,
2010, Section 7.2, Theorem 1).
3.4
Applications
There are numerous applications of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. Here we only
mention a few. The ﬁrst relates the energy in the superposition of two signals to
the energies of the individual signals. The result holds for both complex-valued and
real-valued functions, and—as is our custom—we shall thus not make the codomain
explicit.
Proposition 3.4.1 (Triangle Inequality for L2). If u and v are in L2, then
∥u + v∥2 ≤∥u∥2 + ∥v∥2 .
(3.21)
Proof. The proof is a straightforward application of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
and the basic properties of the inner product (3.6)–(3.10):
∥u + v∥2
2 = ⟨u + v, u + v⟩
= ⟨u, u⟩+ ⟨v, v⟩+ ⟨u, v⟩+ ⟨v, u⟩
= ∥u∥2
2 + ∥v∥2
2 + 2 Re(⟨u, v⟩)
≤∥u∥2
2 + ∥v∥2
2 + 2 |⟨u, v⟩|
≤∥u∥2
2 + ∥v∥2
2 + 2 ∥u∥2 ∥v∥2
=

∥u∥2 + ∥v∥2
2,
from which the result follows by taking square roots. Here the ﬁrst line follows from
the deﬁnition of ∥·∥2 (3.11); the second from (3.9) & (3.10); the third because ⟨v, u⟩
is the complex conjugate of ⟨u, v⟩(3.6); the fourth from the inequality |Re(z)| ≤|z|,
which holds for every z ∈C; the ﬁfth by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality; and the
sixth by simple algebra.

3.4 Applications
21
Another important mathematical consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is
the continuity of the inner product. To state the result we use the notation an →a
to indicate that the sequence a1, a2, . . . converges to a, i.e., that limn→∞an = a.
Proposition 3.4.2 (Continuity of the Inner Product). Let u and v be in L2. If
the sequence u1, u2, . . . of elements of L2 satisﬁes
∥un −u∥2 →0,
and if the sequence v1, v2, . . . of elements of L2 satisﬁes
∥vn −v∥2 →0,
then
⟨un, vn⟩→⟨u, v⟩.
Proof.
|⟨un, vn⟩−⟨u, v⟩|
= |⟨un −u, v⟩+ ⟨un −u, vn −v⟩+ ⟨u, vn −v⟩|
≤|⟨un −u, v⟩| + |⟨un −u, vn −v⟩| + |⟨u, vn −v⟩|
≤∥un −u∥2 ∥v∥2 + ∥un −u∥2 ∥vn −v∥2 + ∥u∥2 ∥vn −v∥2
→0,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the basic properties of the inner product (3.6)–
(3.10); the subsequent inequality by the Triangle Inequality for Complex Numbers
(2.12); the subsequent inequality from the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality; and where
the ﬁnal limit follows from the proposition’s hypotheses.
Another useful consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is that if a signal is
energy-limited and is zero outside an interval, then it is also integrable.
Proposition 3.4.3 (Finite-Energy Functions over Finite Intervals Are Integrable).

the real signal
t 	→

0
if t ≤1,
1/t
otherwise,
(3.22)
is of ﬁnite energy but is not integrable.
The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality demonstrates that if both u and v are of ﬁnite
energy, then their inner product ⟨u, v⟩is well-deﬁned, i.e., the integrand in (3.4) is
integrable. It can also be used in slightly more sophisticated ways. For example, it
can be used to treat cases where one of the functions, say u, is not of ﬁnite energy
but where the second function decays to zero suﬃciently quickly to compensate for
that. For example:
Proposition 3.4.4. If the Lebesgue measurable functions x: R →C and y: R →C
satisfy
 ∞

The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for Random Variables
There is also a version of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for random variables. It is
very similar to Theorem 3.3.1 but with time integrals replaced by expectations. We
denote the expectation of the random variable X by E[X] and remind the reader
that the variance Var[X] of the random variable X is deﬁned as
Var[X] = E

pectations. For a diﬀerent proof and for the conditions for equality see (Grimmett
and Stirzaker, 2001, Chapter 3, Section 3.5, Theorem 9).
For the next corollary we need to recall that the covariance Cov[U, V ] between the
ﬁnite-variance random variables U, V is deﬁned as

Mathematical Comments
(i) Mathematicians typically consider ⟨u, v⟩only when both u and v are of ﬁnite
energy. We are more forgiving and simply require that the integral deﬁning
the inner product be well-deﬁned, i.e., that the integrand be integrable.

The Inner Product
(ii) Some refer to ∥u∥2 as the “norm of u” or the “L2 norm of u.” We shall
refrain from this usage because mathematicians use the term “norm” very
selectively. They require that no function other than the all-zero function be
of zero norm, and this is not the case for ∥·∥2. Indeed, any function u that
is indistinguishable from the all-zero function satisﬁes ∥u∥2 = 0, and there
are many such functions (e.g., the function t 	→I{t is a rational number}
that is equal to one at rational times and that is equal to zero at all other
times). This diﬃculty can be overcome by deﬁning two functions to be the
same if their diﬀerence is of zero energy. In this case ∥·∥2 is a norm in the
mathematical sense and is, in fact, what mathematicians call the L2 norm.
This issue is discussed in greater detail in Section 4.7. To stay out of trouble
we shall refrain from giving ∥·∥2 a name.

Chapter 4
The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
4.1
Introduction
In this chapter we shall study the space L2 of energy-limited signals in greater
detail. We shall show that its elements can be viewed as vectors in a vector space
and begin developing a geometric intuition for understanding its structure. We
shall focus on the case of complex-valued signals, but with some minor changes the
results are also applicable to real-valued signals. (The main changes that are needed
for translating the results to real-valued signals are replacing C with R, ignoring
the conjugation operation, and interpreting |·| as the absolute value function for
real arguments as opposed to the modulus function.)
We remind the reader that the space L2 was deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.1.1 as the set
of all Lebesgue measurable complex-valued signals u: R →C satisfying
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
2 dt < ∞,
(4.1)
and that in (3.12) we deﬁned for every u ∈L2 the quantity ∥u∥2 as
∥u∥2 =
 ∞
−∞
u(t)
2 dt.
(4.2)
We refer to L2 as the space of energy-limited signals and to its elements as energy-
limited signals or signals of ﬁnite energy.
4.2
L2 as a Vector Space
In this section we shall explain how to view the space L2 as a vector space over
the complex ﬁeld by thinking about signals in L2 as vectors, by interpreting the
superposition u + v of two signals as vector-addition, and by interpreting the
ampliﬁcation of u by α as the operation of multiplying the vector u by the scalar
α ∈C.
We begin by reminding the reader that the superposition of the two signals u
and v is denoted by u + v and is the signal that maps every t ∈R to u(t) + v(t).
The ampliﬁcation of u by α is denoted by α u and is the signal that maps every

The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
t ∈R to α u(t). More generally, if u and v are signals and if α and β are complex
numbers, then α u + β v is the signal t 	→α u(t) + β v(t).
If u ∈L2 and α ∈C, then α u is also in L2. Indeed, the measurability of u implies
the measurability of α u, and if u is of ﬁnite energy, then α u is also of ﬁnite energy,
because the energy in α u is the product of |α|2 by the energy in u. We thus see
that the operation of ampliﬁcation of u by α results in an element of L2 whenever
u ∈L2 and α ∈C.
We next show that if the signals u and v are in L2, then their superposition
u+v must also be in L2. This holds because a standard result in Measure Theory
guarantees that the superposition of two Lebesgue measurable signals is a Lebesgue
measurable signal and because Proposition 3.4.1 guarantees that if both u and v
are of ﬁnite energy, then so is their superposition. Thus the superposition that
maps u and v to u + v results in an element of L2 whenever u, v ∈L2.
It can be readily veriﬁed that the following properties hold:
(i) commutativity:
u + v = v + u,
u, v ∈L2;
(ii) associativity:
(u + v) + w = u + (v + w),
u, v, w ∈L2,
(α β) u = α (β u),

α, β ∈C,
u ∈L2

;
(iii) additive identity: the all-zero signal 0: t 	→0 satisﬁes
0 + u = u,
u ∈L2;
(iv) additive inverse:
to every u ∈L2 there corresponds a signal w ∈L2
(namely, the signal t 	→−u(t)) such that
u + w = 0;
(v) multiplicative identity:
1 u = u,
u ∈L2;
(vi) distributive properties:
α (u + v) = α u + α v,

α ∈C,
u, v ∈L2

,
(α + β) u = α u + β u,

α, β ∈C,
u ∈L2

.
We conclude that with the operations of superposition and ampliﬁcation the set L2
forms a vector space over the complex ﬁeld (Axler, 2015, Chapter 1). This justiﬁes
referring to the elements of L2 as “vectors,” to the operation of signal superposition
as “vector addition,” and to the operation of ampliﬁcation of an element of L2 by
a complex scalar as “scalar multiplication.”

4.3 Subspace, Dimension, and Basis
29
4.3
Subspace, Dimension, and Basis
Once we have noted that L2 together with the operations of superposition and
ampliﬁcation forms a vector space, we can borrow numerous deﬁnitions and results
from the theory of vector spaces. Here we shall focus on the very basic ones.
A linear subspace (or just subspace) of L2 is a nonempty subset U of L2 that
is closed under superposition
u1 + u2 ∈U,
u1, u2 ∈U
(4.3)
and under ampliﬁcation
α u ∈U,

α ∈C,
u ∈U

.
(4.4)
Example 4.3.1. Consider the set of all functions of the form
t 	→p(t) e−|t|,
where p(t) is any polynomial of degree no larger than 3. Thus, the set is the set of
all functions of the form
t 	→

α0 + α1 t + α2 t2 + α3 t3
e−|t|,
(4.5)
where α0, α1, α2, α3 are arbitrary complex numbers.
In spite of the polynomial growth of the function in parentheses in (4.5), all the
functions in this set are in L2 because the exponential decay more than compen-
sates for the polynomial growth. The above set is thus a subset of L2. Moreover,
as we show next, this is a linear subspace of L2.
If u is of the form (4.5), then so is α u, because α u is the mapping
t 	→

α α0 + α α1 t + α α2 t2 + α α3 t3
e−|t|,
which is of the same form.
Similarly, if u is as given in (4.5) and
v: t 	→

β0 + β1 t + β2 t2 + β3 t3
e−|t|,
then u + v is the mapping
t 	→

(α0 + β0) + (α1 + β1) t + (α2 + β2) t2 + (α3 + β3) t3
e−|t|,
which is again of this form.
An n-tuple of vectors from L2 is a (possibly empty) ordered list of n vectors
from L2 separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses, e.g., (v1, . . . , vn). Here
n ≥0 can be any nonnegative integer, where the case n = 0 corresponds to the
empty list.
A vector v ∈L2 is said to be a linear combination of the n-tuple (v1, . . . , vn) if
it is equal to
α1 v1 + · · · + αn vn,

The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
which is written more succinctly as
n

ν=1
αν vν,
(4.7)
for some scalars α1, . . . , αn ∈C. The all-zero signal is a linear combination of any
n-tuple including the empty tuple.
The span of an n-tuple (v1, . . . , vn) of vectors in L2 is denoted by
span(v1, . . . , vn)
and is the set of all vectors in L2 that are linear combinations of (v1, . . . , vn):
span(v1, . . . , vn) ≜{α1 v1 + · · · + αn vn : α1, . . . , αn ∈C}.
(4.8)
(The span of the empty tuple is given by the one-element set {0} containing the
all-zero signal only.)
Note that for any n-tuple of vectors (v1, . . . , vn) in L2 we have that span(v1, . . . , vn)
is a linear subspace of L2. Also, if U is a linear subspace of L2 and if the vectors
u1, . . . , un are in U, then span(u1, . . . , un) is a linear subspace which is contained
in U. A subspace U of L2 is said to be ﬁnite-dimensional if there exists an
n-tuple (u1, . . . , un) of vectors in U such that span(u1, . . . , un) = U. Otherwise,
we say that U is inﬁnite-dimensional. For example, the space of all mappings
of the form t 	→p(t) e−|t| for some polynomial p(·) can be shown to be inﬁnite-
dimensional, but under the restriction that p(·) be of degree smaller than 5, it is
ﬁnite-dimensional. If U is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and if U′ is a subspace
contained in U, then U′ must also be ﬁnite-dimensional.
An n-tuple of signals (v1, . . . , vn) in L2 is said to be linearly independent if
whenever the scalars α1, . . . , αn ∈C are such that α1 v1 +· · ·+αn vn = 0, we have
α1 = · · · = αn = 0. I.e., if
	
n

ν=1
αν vν = 0

=⇒

αν = 0,
ν = 1, . . . , n

.
(4.9)
(By convention, the empty tuple is linearly independent.)
For example, the 3-
tuple consisting of the signals t 	→e−|t|, t 	→t e−|t|, and t 	→t2 e−|t| is linearly
independent. If (v1, . . . , vn) is not linearly independent, then we say that it is
linearly dependent. For example, the 3-tuple consisting of the signals t 	→e−|t|,
t 	→t e−|t|, and t 	→

2t + 1

e−|t| is linearly dependent. The n-tuple (v1, . . . , vn)
is linearly dependent if, and only if, (at least) one of the signals in the tuple can
be written as a linear combination of the others.
The d-tuple (u1, . . . , ud) is said to form a basis for the linear subspace U if it is
linearly independent and if span(u1, . . . , ud) = U. The latter condition is equivalent
to the requirement that every u ∈U can be represented as
u = α1 u1 + · · · + αd ud
(4.10)
for some α1, . . . , αd ∈C.
The former condition that the tuple (u1, . . . , ud) be
linearly independent guarantees that if such a representation exists, then it is
.006

4.4 ∥u∥2 as the “length” of the Signal u(·)
31
unique. Thus, (u1, . . . , ud) forms a basis for U if u1, . . . , ud ∈U (thus guaranteeing
that span(u1, . . . , ud) ⊆U) and if every u ∈U can be written uniquely as in (4.10).
Every ﬁnite-dimensional linear subspace U has a basis, and all bases for U have the
same number of elements. This number is called the dimension of U. Thus, if U
is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and if both (u1, . . . , ud) and (u′
1, . . . , u′
d′) form a
basis for U, then d = d′ and both are equal to the dimension of U. The dimension
of the subspace {0} is zero. If U is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace and if U′ is a
subspace contained in U, then the dimension of U′ cannot exceed that of U.
4.4
∥u∥2 as the “length” of the Signal u(·)
Having presented the elements of L2 as vectors, we next propose to view ∥u∥2 as
the “length” of the vector u ∈L2. To motivate this view, we ﬁrst present the key
properties of ∥·∥2.
Proposition 4.4.1 (Properties of ∥·∥2). Let u and v be elements of L2, and let α
be some complex number. Then
∥α u∥2 = |α| ∥u∥2 ,
(4.11)
∥u + v∥2 ≤∥u∥2 + ∥v∥2 ,
(4.12)
and

∥u∥2 = 0

⇐⇒

u ≡0

.
(4.13)
Proof. Identity (4.11) follows directly from the deﬁnition of ∥·∥2; see (4.2). In-
equality (4.12) is a restatement of Proposition 3.4.1. The equivalence of the con-
dition ∥u∥2 = 0 and the condition that u is indistinguishable from the all-zero
signal 0 follows from Proposition 2.5.3.
Identity (4.11) is in agreement with our intuition that stretching a vector merely
scales its length. Inequality (4.12) is sometimes called the Triangle Inequality
because it is reminiscent of the theorem from planar geometry that states that the
length of no side of a triangle can exceed the sum of the lengths of the others; see
Figure 4.1.
Substituting −y for u and x + y for v in (4.12) yields ∥x∥2 ≤∥y∥2 + ∥x + y∥2,
i.e., the inequality ∥x + y∥2 ≥∥x∥2 −∥y∥2. And substituting −x for u and x + y
for v in (4.12) yields the inequality ∥y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + ∥x + y∥2, i.e., the inequality
∥x + y∥2 ≥∥y∥2 −∥x∥2. Combining the two inequalities we obtain the inequality
∥x + y∥2 ≥
∥x∥2 −∥y∥2
. This inequality can be combined with the inequality
∥x + y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2 in the compact form of a double-sided inequality
∥x∥2 −∥y∥2
 ≤∥x + y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 + ∥y∥2 ,
x, y ∈L2.
(4.14)
Finally, (4.13) “almost” supports the intuition that the only vector of length zero
is the zero-vector. In our case, alas, we can only claim that if a vector is of zero
length, then it is indistinguishable from the all-zero signal, i.e., that all t’s outside
a set of Lebesgue measure zero are mapped by the signal to zero.

The Triangle Inequality (4.12) can also be stated slightly diﬀerently. In planar
geometry the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle can never be smaller
than the length of the remaining side. Thus, the shortest path from Point A to
Point B cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths from Point A to
Point C, and from Point C to Point B. By applying Inequality (4.12) to the signal
u −w and w −v we obtain
∥u −v∥2 ≤∥u −w∥2 + ∥w −v∥2 ,
u, v, w ∈L2,
(4.15)
i.e., that the distance from u to v cannot exceed the sum of distances from u to w
and from w to v. See Figure 4.2.

4.5
Orthogonality and Inner Products
To further develop our geometric view of L2 we next discuss orthogonality. We
shall motivate its deﬁnition with an attempt to generalize Pythagoras’s Theorem
to L2. As an initial attempt at deﬁning orthogonality we might deﬁne two func-
tions u, v ∈L2 to be orthogonal if ∥u + v∥2
2 = ∥u∥2
2 + ∥v∥2
2.
Recalling the
deﬁnition of ∥·∥2 (4.2) we obtain that this condition is equivalent to the condition

(4.16)
where we have used the fact that integration commutes with the operation of taking
the real part; see Proposition 2.3.1.
While this approach would work well for real-valued functions, it has some embar-
rassing consequences when it comes to complex-valued functions. It allows for the
possibility that u is orthogonal to v, but that its scaled version αu is not. For exam-
ple, with this deﬁnition, the function t 	→i I{|t| ≤5} is orthogonal to the function
t 	→I{|t| ≤17} but its scaled (by α = i) version t 	→i i I{|t| ≤5} = −I{|t| ≤5} is
not. To avoid this embarrassment, we deﬁne u to be orthogonal to v if
∥α u + v∥2
2 = ∥α u∥2
2 + ∥v∥2
2 ,
α ∈C.
This, by (4.16), is equivalent to
Re

i.e., to the condition

(4.17)
(because if z ∈C is such that Re(α z) = 0 for all α ∈C, then z = 0). Recalling
the deﬁnition of the inner product ⟨u, v⟩from (3.4)
⟨u, v⟩=
 ∞

u(t) v∗(t) dt,
(4.18)
we conclude that (4.17) is equivalent to the condition ⟨u, v⟩= 0 or, equivalently
(because by (3.6) ⟨u, v⟩= ⟨v, u⟩∗) to the condition ⟨v, u⟩= 0.

The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
The n-tuple (u1, . . . , un) of signals in L2 is said to be orthogonal if the signals in
it are pairwise orthogonal

ℓ̸= ℓ′,
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , n}

(4.20)
The reader is encouraged to verify that if u is orthogonal to v then so is αu. Also,
u is orthogonal to v if, and only if, v is orthogonal to u. Finally every function is
orthogonal to the all-zero function 0.
Having judiciously deﬁned orthogonality in L2, we can now extend Pythagoras’s
Theorem.
Theorem 4.5.2 (A Pythagorean Theorem). If the n-tuple of vectors (u1, . . . , un)
in L2 is orthogonal, then
∥u1 + · · · + un∥2

2 + · · · + ∥un∥2

Proof. This theorem can be proved by induction on n. The case n = 2 follows
from (4.16) using Deﬁnition 4.5.1 and (4.18).
Assume now that the theorem holds for n = ν, for some ν ≥2, i.e.,
∥u1 + · · · + uν∥2
2 = ∥u1∥2
2 + · · · + ∥uν∥2
2 ,
and let us show that this implies that it also holds for n = ν + 1, i.e., that
∥u1 + · · · + uν+1∥2
2 = ∥u1∥2
2 + · · · + ∥uν+1∥2
2 .
To that end, let
v = u1 + · · · + uν.
(4.21)
Since the ν-tuple (u1, . . . , uν) is orthogonal, our induction hypothesis guarantees
that
∥v∥2
2 = ∥u1∥2
2 + · · · + ∥uν∥2
2 .
(4.22)
Now v is orthogonal to uν+1 because
⟨v, uν+1⟩= ⟨u1 + · · · + uν, uν+1⟩
= ⟨u1, uν+1⟩+ · · · + ⟨uν, uν+1⟩
= 0,
so by the n = 2 case
∥v + uν+1∥2
2 = ∥v∥2
2 + ∥uν+1∥2
2 .
(4.23)
Combining (4.21), (4.22), and (4.23) we obtain
∥u1 + · · · + uν+1∥2
2 = ∥v + uν+1∥2
2
= ∥v∥2
2 + ∥uν+1∥2
2
= ∥u1∥2

4.5 Orthogonality and Inner Products

v
u
w
Figure 4.3: The projection w of the vector v onto u.
To derive a geometric interpretation for the inner product ⟨u, v⟩we next extend
to L2 the notion of the projection of a vector onto another. We ﬁrst recall the
deﬁnition for vectors in R2. Consider two nonzero vectors u and v in the real
plane R2. The projection w of the vector v onto u is a scaled version of u. More
speciﬁcally, it is a scaled version of u and its length is equal to the product of the
length of v multiplied by the cosine of the angle between v and u (see Figure 4.3).
More explicitly,
w = (length of v) cos(angle between v and u)
u
length of u.
(4.24)
This deﬁnition does not seem to have a natural extension to L2 because we have not
deﬁned the angle between two signals. An alternative deﬁnition of the projection,
and one that is more amenable to extensions to L2, is the following. The vector w
is the projection of the vector v onto u, if w is a scaled version of u, and if v −w
is orthogonal to u.
This deﬁnition makes perfect sense also in L2, because we have already deﬁned
what we mean by “scaled version” (i.e., “ampliﬁcation” or “scalar multiplication”)
and “orthogonality.” We thus have:
Deﬁnition 4.5.3 (Projection of a Signal in L2 onto another). Let u ∈L2 have
positive energy. The projection of the signal v ∈L2 onto the signal u ∈L2
is the signal w that satisﬁes both of the following conditions:
1) w = α u for some α ∈C and
2) v −w is orthogonal to u.
Note that since L2 is closed with respect to scalar multiplication, Condition 1)
guarantees that the projection w is in L2.
Prima facie it is not clear that a projection always exists and that it is unique.
Nevertheless, this is the case.
We prove this by ﬁnding an explicit expression
for w. We need to ﬁnd some α ∈C so that α u will satisfy the requirements of
.006

The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
the projection. The scalar α is chosen so as to guarantee that v −w is orthogonal
to u. That is, we seek to solve for α ∈C satisfying
⟨v −α u, u⟩= 0,
i.e.,
⟨v, u⟩−α ∥u∥2
2 = 0.
Recalling our hypothesis that ∥u∥2 > 0 (strictly), we conclude that α is uniquely
given by
α = ⟨v, u⟩
∥u∥2
2
,
and the projection w is thus unique and is given by
w = ⟨v, u⟩
∥u∥2
2
u.
(4.25)
Comparing (4.24) and (4.25) we can interpret
⟨v, u⟩
∥u∥2 ∥v∥2
(4.26)
as the cosine of the angle between the function v and the function u (provided
that neither u nor v is of zero energy). If the inner product is zero, then we have
said that v and u are orthogonal, which is consistent with the cosine of the angle
between them being zero. Note, however, that this interpretation should be taken
with a grain of salt because in the complex case the inner product in (4.26) is
typically a complex number.
The interpretation of (4.26) as the cosine of the angle between v and u is further
supported by noting that the magnitude of (4.26) is always in the range [0, 1]. This
follows directly from the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (Theorem 3.3.1) to which we
next give another (geometric) proof. Let w be the projection of v onto u. Then
starting from (4.25)
|⟨v, u⟩|2
∥u∥2
2
= ∥w∥2
2
≤∥w∥2
2 + ∥v −w∥2
2
= ∥w + (v −w)∥2
2
= ∥v∥2
2 ,
(4.27)
where the ﬁrst equality follows from (4.25); the subsequent inequality from the
nonnegativity of ∥·∥2; and the subsequent equality by the Pythagorean Theorem
because, by its deﬁnition, the projection w of v onto u must satisfy that v −w is
orthogonal to u and hence also to w, which is a scaled version of u. The Cauchy-
Schwarz Inequality now follows from (4.27) by multiplying each of its sides by ∥u∥2
2
and then taking the square root of the result.

4.6
Orthonormal Bases
We next consider orthonormal bases for ﬁnite-dimensional linear subspaces. These
are special bases that are particularly useful for the calculation of projections and
inner products.
4.6.1
Deﬁnition
Deﬁnition 4.6.1 (Orthonormal Tuple). An n-tuple of signals in L2 is said to be
orthonormal if it is orthogonal and if each of the signals in the tuple is of unit
energy.
Thus, the n-tuple (φ1, . . . , φn) of signals in L2 is orthonormal, if
⟨φℓ, φℓ′⟩=

0
if ℓ̸= ℓ′,
1
if ℓ= ℓ′,
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(4.28)
Linearly independent tuples need not be orthonormal, but orthonormal tuples must
be linearly independent:
Proposition 4.6.2 (Orthonormal Tuples Are Linearly Independent). If a tuple of
signals in L2 is orthonormal, then it must be linearly independent.
Proof. Let the n-tuple (φ1, . . . , φn) of signals in L2 be orthonormal, i.e., satisfy
(4.28). We need to show that if
n

ℓ=1
αℓφℓ= 0,
(4.29)
then all the coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn must be zero. To that end, assume (4.29). It
then follows that for every ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , n}
0 = ⟨0, φℓ′⟩
=

=

ℓ=1
αℓ⟨φℓ, φℓ′⟩

ℓ=1
αℓI{ℓ= ℓ′}
= αℓ′,
thus demonstrating that (4.29) implies that αℓ′ = 0 for every ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , n}. Here
the ﬁrst equality follows because 0 is orthogonal to every energy-limited signal
and, a fortiori, to φℓ′; the second by (4.29); the third by the linearity of the inner
product in its left argument (3.7) & (3.9); and the fourth by (4.28).

The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
Deﬁnition 4.6.3 (Orthonormal Basis). A d-tuple of signals in L2 is said to form
an orthonormal basis for the linear subspace U ⊂L2 if it is orthonormal and
its span is U.
By convention the empty tuple forms an orthonormal basis for the 0-dimensional
subspace {0} whose sole element is the all-zero signal.
4.6.2
Representing a Signal Using an Orthonormal Basis
Suppose that (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal basis for U ⊂L2.
The fact that
(φ1, . . . , φd) spans U guarantees that every u ∈U can be written as u = 
ℓαℓφℓ
for some coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αd ∈C. The fact that (φ1, . . . , φd) is orthonormal
implies, by Proposition 4.6.2, that it is also linearly independent and hence that
the coeﬃcients {αℓ} are unique. How does one go about ﬁnding these coeﬃcients?
We next show that the orthonormality of (φ1, . . . , φd) also implies a very simple
expression for αℓabove. Indeed, as the next proposition demonstrates, αℓis given
explicitly as ⟨u, φℓ⟩.
Proposition 4.6.4 (Representing a Signal Using an Orthonormal Basis).
(i) If (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal tuple of functions in L2 and if u ∈L2 can
be written as u = d
ℓ=1 αℓφℓfor some complex numbers α1, . . . , αd, then
αℓ= ⟨u, φℓ⟩for every ℓ∈{1, . . . , d}:

thus proving Part (i).
We next prove Part (ii). Let u ∈U be arbitrary. Since, by assumption, the tuple
(φ1, . . . , φd) forms an orthonormal basis for U it follows a fortiori that its span
is U and, consequently, that there exist coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αd ∈C such that
u =
d

ℓ=1
αℓφℓ.
(4.32)
It now follows from Part (i) that for each ℓ∈{1, . . . , d} the coeﬃcient αℓin (4.32)
must be equal to ⟨u, φℓ⟩, thus establishing (4.31).
This proposition shows that if (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal basis for the sub-
space U and if u ∈U, then u is fully determined by the complex constants ⟨u, φ1⟩,
. . . , ⟨u, φd⟩. Thus, any calculation involving u can be computed from these con-
stants by ﬁrst reconstructing u using the proposition. As we shall see in Proposi-
tion 4.6.9, calculations involving inner products and norms are, however, simpler
than that.
4.6.3
Projection
We next discuss the projection of a signal v ∈L2 onto a ﬁnite-dimensional linear
subspace U that has an orthonormal basis (φ1, . . . , φd).1 To deﬁne the projection
we shall extend the approach we adopted in Section 4.5 for the projection of the
vector v onto the vector u. Recall that in that section we deﬁned the projection
as the vector w that is a scaled version of u and that satisﬁes that (v −w) is
orthogonal to u. Of course, if (v −w) is orthogonal to u, then it is orthogonal to
any scaled version of u, i.e., it is orthogonal to every signal in the space span(u).
We would like to adopt this approach and to deﬁne the projection of v ∈L2 onto U
as the element w of U for which (v −w) is orthogonal to every signal in U. Before
we can adopt this deﬁnition, we must show that such an element of U always exists
and that it is unique.
Lemma 4.6.5. Let (φ1, . . . , φd) be an orthonormal basis for the linear subspace
U ⊂L2. Let v ∈L2 be arbitrary.
(i) The signal v −d
ℓ=1 ⟨v, φℓ⟩φℓis orthogonal to every signal in U:

orthonormal basis. Here we shall only discuss projections onto subspaces that do.

ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , d}.
(4.35)
Having veriﬁed (4.33) for u = φℓ′ we next verify that this implies that it holds
for all u ∈U. By Proposition 4.6.4 we obtain that any u ∈U can be written as
u = d
ℓ′=1 βℓ′φℓ′, where βℓ′ = ⟨u, φℓ′⟩. Consequently,

u ∈U
(4.36)
and
⟨v −w′, u⟩= 0,

(4.37)
then w = w′.

the fourth by the linearity of the inner product in its left argument (3.9); and the
ﬁfth equality from (4.36) & (4.37) applied by substituting φℓfor u.
With the aid of the above lemma we can now deﬁne the projection of a signal onto
a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace that has an orthonormal basis.2
Deﬁnition 4.6.6 (Projection of v ∈L2 onto U). Let U ⊂L2 be a ﬁnite-
dimensional linear subspace of L2 having an orthonormal basis. Let v ∈L2 be an
arbitrary energy-limited signal. Then the projection of v onto U is the unique
element w of U such that
⟨v −w, u⟩= 0,
u ∈U.
(4.38)
Note 4.6.7. By Lemma 4.6.5 it follows that if (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal basis
for U, then the projection of v ∈L2 onto U is given by
d

ℓ=1
⟨v, φℓ⟩φℓ.
(4.39)
To further develop the geometric picture of L2, we next show that, loosely speaking,
the projection of v ∈L2 onto U is the element in U that is closest to v. This result
can also be viewed as an optimal approximation result: if we wish to approximate v
by an element of U, then the optimal approximation is the projection of v onto U,
provided that we measure the quality of our approximation using the energy in the
error signal.
Proposition 4.6.8 (Projection as Best Approximation). Let U ⊂L2 be a ﬁnite-
dimensional subspace of L2 having an orthonormal basis. Let v ∈L2 be arbitrary.
Then the projection of v onto U is the element w ∈U that, among all the elements
of U, is closest to v in the sense that
∥v −u∥2 ≥∥v −w∥2 ,
u ∈U.
(4.40)
Proof. Let w be the projection of v onto U and let u be an arbitrary signal in U.
Since, by the deﬁnition of projection, w is in U and since U is a linear subspace,
it follows that w −u ∈U. Consequently, since by the deﬁnition of the projection
2A projection can also be deﬁned if the subspace does not have an orthonormal basis, but in
this case there is a uniqueness issue. There may be numerous vectors w ∈U such that v −w is
orthogonal to all vectors in U. Fortunately, they are all indistinguishable.

v −w is orthogonal to every element of U, it follows that v −w is a fortiori
orthogonal to w −u. Thus

(4.42)
where the ﬁrst equality follows by subtracting and adding w, the second equality
from the orthogonality of (v −w) and (w −u), and the ﬁnal inequality by the
nonnegativity of ∥·∥2. It follows from (4.42) that no signal in U is closer to v
than w is.
And it follows from (4.41) that if u ∈U is as close to v as w is,
then u −w must be an element of U that is of zero energy.
We shall see in
Proposition 4.6.10 that the hypothesis that U has an orthonormal basis implies
that the only zero-energy element of U is 0. Thus u and w must be identical, and
no other element of U is as close to v as w is.
4.6.4
Energy, Inner Products, and Orthonormal Bases
As demonstrated by Proposition 4.6.4, if (φ1, . . . , φd) forms an orthonormal basis
for the subspace U ⊂L2, then any signal u ∈U can be reconstructed from the d
numbers ⟨u, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨u, φd⟩. Any quantity that can be computed from u can thus
be computed from ⟨u, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨u, φd⟩by ﬁrst reconstructing u and by then per-
forming the calculation on u. But some calculations involving u can be performed
based on ⟨u, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨u, φd⟩much more easily.
Proposition 4.6.9. Let (φ1, . . . , φd) be an orthonormal basis for the linear subspace
U ⊂L2.
(i) The energy ∥u∥2

sesquilinearity of the inner product ((3.10) and (3.8)).
Proposition 4.6.9 has interesting consequences. It shows that if one thinks of ⟨u, φℓ⟩
as the ℓ-th coordinate of u (with respect to the orthonormal basis (φ1, . . . , φd)),
then the energy in u is simply the sum of the squares of the coordinates, and the
inner product between two functions is the sum of the products of each coordinate
of u and the conjugate of the corresponding coordinate of v.
We hope that the properties of orthonormal bases that we presented above have
convinced the reader by now that there are certain advantages to describing func-
tions using an orthonormal basis. A crucial question arises as to whether orthonor-
mal bases always exist. This question is addressed next.
4.6.5
Does an Orthonormal Basis Exist?
Word on the street has it that every ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of L2 has an
orthonormal basis, but this is not true. (It is true for the space L2 that we shall
encounter later.) For example, the set

u ∈L2 : u(t) = 0
whenever t ̸= 17

of all energy-limited signals that map t to zero whenever t ̸= 17 (with the value
to which t = 17 is mapped being unspeciﬁed) is a one dimensional subspace of L2
that does not have an orthonormal basis. (All the signals in this subspace are of
zero energy, so there are no unit-energy signals in it.)
Proposition 4.6.10. If U is a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of L2, then the following
two statements are equivalent:
(a) U has an orthonormal basis.
(b) The only element of U of zero energy is the all-zero signal 0.
Proof. The proof has two parts. The ﬁrst consists of showing that (a) ⇒(b), i.e.,
that if U has an orthonormal basis and if u ∈U is of zero energy, then u must
be the all-zero signal 0. The second part consists of showing that (b) ⇒(a), i.e.,
that if the only element of zero energy in U is the all-zero signal 0, then U has an
orthonormal basis.

We begin with the ﬁrst part, namely, (a) ⇒(b). We thus assume that (φ1, . . . , φd)
is an orthonormal basis for U and that u ∈U satisﬁes ∥u∥2 = 0 and proceed
to prove that u = 0. We simply note that, by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,
|⟨u, φℓ⟩| ≤∥u∥2 ∥φℓ∥2 so the condition ∥u∥2 = 0 implies
⟨u, φℓ⟩= 0,
ℓ∈{1, . . . , d},
(4.47)
and hence, by Proposition 4.6.4, that u = 0.
To show (b) ⇒(a) we need to show that if no signal in U other than 0 has zero
energy, then U has an orthonormal basis. The proof is based on the Gram-Schmidt
Procedure, which is presented next. As we shall prove, if the input to this procedure
is a basis for U and if no element of U other than 0 is of energy zero, then the
procedure produces an orthonormal basis for U. The procedure is actually even
more powerful. If it is fed a basis for a subspace that does contain an element other
than 0 of zero-energy, then the procedure produces such an element and halts.
It should be emphasized that the Gram-Schmidt Procedure is not only useful for
proving theorems; it can be quite useful for ﬁnding orthonormal bases for practical
problems.3
4.6.6
The Gram-Schmidt Procedure
The Gram-Schmidt Procedure is named after the mathematicians Jørgen Pedersen
Gram (1850–1916) and Erhard Schmidt (1876–1959). However, as pointed out in
(Farebrother, 1988), this procedure was apparently already presented by Pierre-
Simon Laplace (1749–1827) and was used by Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789–1857).
The input to the Gram-Schmidt Procedure is a basis (u1, . . . , ud) for a d-dimensional
subspace U ⊂L2. We assume that d ≥1. (The only 0-dimensional subspace of L2
is the subspace {0} containing the all-zero signal only, and for this subspace the
empty tuple is an orthonormal basis; there is not much else to say here.) If U
does not contain a signal of zero energy other than the all-zero signal 0, then the
procedure runs in d steps and produces an orthonormal basis for U (and thus also
proves that U does not contain a zero-energy signal other than 0). Otherwise, the
procedure stops after d or fewer steps and produces an element of U of zero energy
other than 0.
The Gram-Schmidt Procedure:
Step 1: If ∥u1∥2 = 0, then the procedure declares that there exists a
zero-energy element of U other than 0, it produces u1 as proof, and it
halts. Otherwise, it deﬁnes
φ1 =
u1
∥u1∥2
and halts with the output (φ1) (if d = 1) or proceeds to Step 2 (if
d > 1).
3Numerically, however, it is unstable; see (Golub and van Loan, 1996).

The Space L2 of Energy-Limited Signals
Assuming that the procedure has run for ν −1 steps without halting
and has deﬁned the vectors φ1, . . . , φν−1, we next describe Step ν.
Step ν: Consider the signal
˜uν = uν −
ν−1

ℓ=1
⟨uν, φℓ⟩φℓ.
(4.48)
If ∥˜uν∥2 = 0, then the procedure declares that there exists a zero-
energy element of U other than 0, it produces ˜uν as proof, and it halts.
Otherwise, the procedure deﬁnes
φν =
˜uν
∥˜uν∥2
(4.49)
and halts with the output (φ1, . . . , φd) (if ν is equal to d) or proceeds
to Step ν + 1 (if ν < d).
We next prove that the procedure behaves as we claim.
Proof. To prove that the procedure behaves as we claim, we shall assume that the
procedure performs Step ν (i.e., that it has not halted in the steps preceding ν)
and prove the following: if at Step ν the procedure declares that U contains a
nonzero signal of zero-energy and produces ˜uν as proof, then this is indeed the
case; otherwise, if it deﬁnes φν as in (4.49), then (φ1, . . . , φν) is an orthonormal
basis for span(u1, . . . , uν).
We prove this by induction on ν. For ν = 1 this can be veriﬁed as follows. If
∥u1∥2 = 0, then we need to show that u1 ∈U and that it is not equal to 0. This
follows from the assumption that the procedure’s input (u1, . . . , ud) forms a basis
for U, so a fortiori the signals u1, . . . , ud must all be elements of U and neither
of them can be the all-zero signal. If ∥u1∥2 > 0, then φ1 is a unit-energy scaled
version of u1 and thus (φ1) is an orthonormal basis for span(u1).
We now assume that our claim is true for ν −1 and proceed to prove that it is also
true for ν. We thus assume that Step ν is executed and that (φ1, . . . , φν−1) is an
orthonormal basis for span(u1, . . . , uν−1):
φ1, . . . , φν−1 ∈U;
(4.50)
span(φ1, . . . , φν−1) = span(u1, . . . , uν−1);
(4.51)
and
⟨φℓ, φℓ′⟩= I{ℓ= ℓ′},
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , ν −1}.
(4.52)
We need to prove that if ˜uν is of zero energy, then it is a nonzero element of U of
zero energy, and that otherwise the ν-tuple (φ1, . . . , φν) is an orthonormal basis
for span(u1, . . . , uν). To that end we ﬁrst prove that
˜uν ∈U
(4.53)
and that
˜uν ̸= 0.
(4.54)

4.6 Orthonormal Bases
47
We begin with a proof of (4.53). Since (4.48) expresses ˜uν as a linear combination
of (φ1, . . . , φν−1, uν), and since U is by assumption a linear subspace, it suﬃces to
show that φ1, . . . , φν−1 ∈U and that uν ∈U. The former follows from (4.50) and
the latter from our assumption that (u1, . . . , ud) forms a basis for U.
We next prove (4.54). By (4.48) it suﬃces to show that uν /∈span(φ1, . . . , φν−1).
By (4.51) this is equivalent to showing that uν /∈span(u1, . . . , uν−1), which fol-
lows from our assumption that (u1, . . . , ud) is a basis for U and a fortiori linearly
independent.
Having established (4.53) and (4.54) it follows that if ∥˜uν∥2 = 0, then ˜uν is a
nonzero element of U which is of zero-energy as we had claimed.
To conclude the proof we now assume ∥˜uν∥2 > 0 and prove that (φ1, . . . , φν) is
an orthonormal basis for span(u1, . . . , uν). That (φ1, . . . , φν) is orthonormal fol-
lows because (4.52) guarantees that (φ1, . . . , φν−1) is orthonormal; because (4.49)
guarantees that φν is of unit energy; and because Lemma 4.6.5 (applied to the lin-
ear subspace span(φ1, . . . , φν−1)) guarantees that ˜uν—and hence also its scaled
version φν—is orthogonal to every element of span(φ1, . . . , φν−1) and in par-
ticular to φ1, . . . , φν−1. It thus only remains to show that span(φ1, . . . , φν) =
span(u1, . . . , uν). We ﬁrst show that span(φ1, . . . , φν) ⊆span(u1, . . . , uν). This
follows because (4.51) implies that
φ1, . . . , φν−1 ∈span(u1, . . . , uν−1);
(4.55)
because (4.55), (4.48) and (4.49) imply that
φν ∈span(u1, . . . , uν);
(4.56)
and because (4.55) and (4.56) imply that φ1, . . . , φν ∈span(u1, . . . , uν) and hence
that span(φ1, . . . , φν) ⊆span(u1, . . . , uν). The reverse inclusion can be argued
very similarly: by (4.51)
u1, . . . , uν−1 ∈span(φ1, . . . , φν−1);
(4.57)
by (4.48) and (4.49) we can express uν as a linear combination of (φ1, . . . , φν)
uν = ∥˜uν∥2 φν +
ν−1

ℓ=1
⟨uν, φℓ⟩φℓ;
(4.58)
and (4.57) & (4.58) combine to prove that u1, . . . , uν ∈span(φ1, . . . , φν) and hence
that span(u1, . . . , uν) ⊆span(φ1, . . . , φν).
By far the more important scenario for us is when U does not contain a nonzero
element of zero energy. This is because we shall mostly focus on signals that are
bandlimited (see Chapter 6), and the only energy-limited signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz and that has zero-energy is the all-zero signal (Note 6.4.2). For subspaces
not containing zero-energy signals other than 0 the key properties to note about
the signals φ1, . . . , φd produced by the Gram-Schmidt procedure are that they
satisfy for each ν ∈{1, . . . , d}
span(u1, . . . , uν) = span(φ1, . . . , φν)

These properties are, of course, of greatest importance when ν = d.
We next provide an example of the Gram-Schmidt procedure.
Example 4.6.11. Consider the following three signals: u1 : t 	→I{0 ≤t ≤1},
u2 : t 	→t I{0 ≤t ≤1}, and u3 : t 	→t2 I{0 ≤t ≤1}. The tuple (u1, u2, u3) forms
a basis for the subspace of all signals of the form t 	→p(t) I{0 ≤t ≤1}, where p(·)
is a polynomial of degree smaller than 3. To construct an orthonormal basis for
this subspace with the Gram-Schmidt Procedure, we begin by normalizing u1. To
that end, we compute
∥u1∥2
2 =

−∞
|I{0 ≤t ≤1}|2 dt = 1
and set φ1 = u1/ ∥u1∥2, so
φ1 : t 	→I{0 ≤t ≤1}.
(4.60a)
The second function φ2 is now obtained by normalizing u2 −⟨u2, φ1⟩φ1. We ﬁrst
compute the inner product ⟨u2, φ1⟩
⟨u2, φ1⟩=

I{0 ≤t ≤1} t I{0 ≤t ≤1} dt =

The third function φ3 is the normalized version of u3 −⟨u3, φ1⟩φ1 −⟨u3, φ2⟩φ2.

4.7 The Space L2

4.7
The Space L2
Very informally one can describe the space L2 as the space of all energy-limited
complex-valued signals, where we think of two signals as being diﬀerent only if they
are distinguishable. This section deﬁnes L2 more precisely. It can be skipped be-
cause we shall have only little to do with L2. Understanding this space is, however,
important for readers who wish to fully understand how the Fourier Transform is
deﬁned for energy-limited signals that are not integrable (Section 6.2.3). Readers
who continue should recall from Section 2.5 that two energy-limited signals u and v
are said to be indistinguishable if the set {t ∈R : u(t) ̸= v(t)} is of Lebesgue
measure zero. We write u ≡v to indicate that u and v are indistinguishable. By
Proposition 2.5.3, the condition u ≡v is equivalent to the condition ∥u −v∥2 = 0.
To motivate the deﬁnition of the space L2, we begin by noting that the space L2
of energy-limited signals is “almost” an example of what mathematicians call an
“inner product space,” but it is not. The problem is that mathematicians insist
that in an inner product space the only vector whose inner product with itself is
zero be the zero vector. This is not the case in L2: it is possible that u ∈L2
satisfy ⟨u, u⟩= 0 (i.e., ∥u∥2 = 0) and yet not be the all-zero signal 0. From the
condition ∥u∥2 = 0 we can only infer that u is indistinguishable from 0.
The fact that L2 is not an inner product space is an annoyance because it pre-
cludes us from borrowing from the vast literature on inner product spaces (and
Hilbert spaces, which are special kinds of inner product spaces), and because it
does not allow us to view some of the results about L2 as instances of more gen-
eral principles. For this reason mathematicians prefer to study the space L2, which
is an inner product space (and which is, in fact, a Hilbert space) rather than L2.
Unfortunately, for this luxury they pay a certain price that I am loath to pay.
Consequently, in most of this book I have decided to stick to L2 even though this
precludes me from using the standard results on inner product spaces. The price
one pays for using L2 will become apparent once we deﬁne it.
To understand how L2 is constructed it is useful to note that the relation “u ≡v”,
i.e., “u is indistinguishable from v” is an equivalence relation on L2, i.e., it
satisﬁes
u ≡u,
u ∈L2;

u ≡v

v ≡u

and

u ≡v and v ≡w

=⇒

u ≡w


u, v, w ∈L2.
(transitive)
Using these properties one can verify that if for every u ∈L2 we deﬁne its equiv-
alence class [u] as
[u] ≜
˜u ∈L2 : ˜u ≡u},
(4.61)
then two equivalence classes [u] and [v] must be either identical or disjoint. In
fact, the sets [u] ⊂L2 and [v] ⊂L2 are identical if, and only if, u and v are
indistinguishable

[u] = [v]

,
u, v ∈L2.
We deﬁne L2 as the set of all such equivalence classes
L2 ≜

[u] : u ∈L2}.
(4.62)
Thus, the elements of L2 are not functions, but sets of functions. Each element
of L2 is an equivalence class, i.e., a set of the form [u] for some u ∈L2. And for
each u ∈L2 the equivalence class [u] is an element of L2.
As we next show, the space L2 can also be viewed as a vector space. To this end
we need to ﬁrst deﬁne “ampliﬁcation of an equivalence class by a scalar α ∈C” and
“superposition of two equivalence classes.” How do we deﬁne the scaling-by-α of
an equivalence class S ∈L2? A natural approach is to ﬁnd some function u ∈L2
such that S is its equivalence class (i.e., satisfying S = [u]), and to deﬁne the
scaling-by-α of S as the equivalence class of α u, i.e., as [α u]. Thus we would
deﬁne α S as the equivalence class of the signal t 	→α u(t). While this turns out to
be a good approach, the careful reader might be concerned by something. Suppose
that S = [u] but that also S = [˜u]. Should α S be deﬁned as the equivalence class
of t 	→α u(t) or of t 	→α ˜u(t)? Fortunately, it does not matter because the two
equivalence classes are the same! Indeed, if [u] = [˜u], then the equivalence class of
t 	→α u(t) is equal to the equivalence class of t 	→α ˜u(t) (because [u] = [˜u] implies
that u and ˜u agree except on a set of measure zero so α u and α ˜u also agree except
on a set of measure zero, which in turn implies that [α u] = [α ˜u]).
Similarly, one can show that if S1 ∈L2 and S2 ∈L2 are two equivalence classes,
then we can deﬁne their sum (or superposition) S1 + S2 as [u1 + u2] where u1
is any function in L2 such that S1 = [u1] and where u2 is any function in L2
such that S2 = [u2]. Again, to make sure that the result of the superposition of
S1 and S2 does not depend on the choice of u1 and u2 we need to verify that if
S1 = [u1] = [˜u1] and if S2 = [u2] = [˜u2] then [u1 + u2] = [˜u1 + ˜u2]. This is not
diﬃcult but is omitted.
Using these deﬁnitions and by deﬁning the zero vector to be the equivalence
class [0], it is not diﬃcult to show that L2 forms a linear space over the com-
plex ﬁeld. To make it into an inner product space we need to deﬁne the inner
product ⟨S1, S2⟩between two equivalence classes. If S1 = [u1] and if S2 = [u2]
we deﬁne the inner product ⟨S1, S2⟩as the complex number ⟨u1, u2⟩. Again, we
have to show that our deﬁnition is good in the sense that it does not depend on
the particular choice of u1 and u2. More speciﬁcally, we need to verify that if
S1 = [u1] = [˜u1] and if S2 = [u2] = [˜u2] then ⟨u1, u2⟩= ⟨˜u1, ˜u2⟩. This can be
proved as follows:
⟨u1, u2⟩= ⟨˜u1 + (u1 −˜u1), u2⟩
= ⟨˜u1, u2⟩+ ⟨u1 −˜u1, u2⟩
= ⟨˜u1, u2⟩
= ⟨˜u1, ˜u2 + (u2 −˜u2)⟩

= ⟨˜u1, ˜u2⟩+ ⟨˜u1, u2 −˜u2⟩
= ⟨˜u1, ˜u2⟩,
where the third equality follows because [u1] = [˜u1] implies that ∥u1 −˜u1∥2 = 0
and hence that ⟨u1 −˜u1, u2⟩= 0 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality), and where the
last equality follows by a similar reasoning about u2 and ˜u2.
Using the above
deﬁnition of the inner product between equivalence classes one can show that if for
some equivalence class S we have ⟨S, S⟩= 0, then S is the zero vector, i.e., the
equivalence class [0].
With these deﬁnitions of the scaling of an equivalence class by a scalar, the super-
position of two equivalence classes, and the inner product between two equivalence
classes, the space of equivalence classes L2 becomes an inner product space in the
sense that mathematicians like. In fact, it is a Hilbert space.
What is the price we have to pay for working in an inner product space?
It
is that the elements of L2 are not functions but equivalence classes and that it
is meaningless to talk about the value they take at a given time. For example,
it is meaningless to discuss the supremum (or maximum) of an element of L2.4
To add to the confusion, mathematicians refer to elements of L2 as “functions”
(even though they are equivalence classes of functions), and they drop the square
brackets. Things get even trickier when one deals with signals contaminated by
noise. If one views the signals as elements of L2, then the result of adding noise to
them is not a stochastic process (Deﬁnition 12.2.1 ahead). We ﬁnd this price too
high, and in this book we shall mostly deal with L2.
4.8
Additional Reading
Most of the results of this chapter follow from basic results on inner product spaces
and can be found, for example, in (Axler, 2015). However, since L2 is not an inner-
product space, we had to introduce some slight modiﬁcations.
More on the deﬁnition of the space L2 can be found in most texts on analysis. See,
for example, (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 3, Remark 3.10) and (Royden and Fitzpatrick,
2010, Section 7.1).

Chapter 5
Convolutions and Filters
5.1
Introduction
Convolutions play a central role in the analysis of linear systems, and it is thus
not surprising that they will appear repeatedly in this book. Most of the readers
have probably seen the deﬁnition and key properties in an earlier course on linear
systems, so this chapter can be viewed as a very short review. New perhaps is
the following section on notation and the all-important Section 5.8 on the matched
ﬁlter and its use in calculating inner products.
5.2
Time Shifts and Reﬂections
Suppose that x: R →R is a real signal, where we think of the argument as being
time. Such functions are typically plotted on paper with the time arrow pointing
to the right. Take a moment to plot an example of such a function, and on the
same coordinates plot the function
t 	→x(t −t0),
which maps every t ∈R to x(t −t0) for some positive t0. Repeat with t0 being
negative. This may seem like a mindless exercise but there is a point to it. It
will help you understand convolutions graphically and help you visualize mappings
such as t 	→
ℓαℓg(t −ℓTs), which we will encounter later in our study of Pulse
Amplitude Modulation (PAM). It will also help you visualize the matched ﬁlter.
Given a complex signal x: R →C, we denote its reﬂection or mirror image
by ~x, so
~x: t 	→x(−t).
(5.1)
When x is real, the plot of ~x is the mirror image of the plot of x about the vertical
axis. The mirror image of the mirror image of x is always x.

5.3 The Convolution Expression
55
5.3
The Convolution Expression
The convolution x ⋆h between two complex signals x: R →C and h: R →C is
formally deﬁned as the complex signal whose time-t value (x ⋆h)(t) is given by
(x ⋆h)(t) =
 ∞
−∞
x(τ) h(t −τ) dτ.
(5.2)
Note that the integrand in the above is complex. (Integrals of complex functions
are discussed in Section 2.3.) This deﬁnition also holds for real signals.
We used the term “formally deﬁned” because certain conditions need to be met
for this integral to be deﬁned. It is conceivable that for some t ∈R the integrand
τ 	→x(τ) h(t −τ) will not be integrable, so the integral will be undeﬁned. (Recall
that in this book we only allow integrals of the form
 ∞
−∞g(t) dt if the integrand
g(·) is in L1 so
 ∞
−∞|g(t)| dt < ∞.1) We thus say that x ⋆h is deﬁned at t ∈R if
τ 	→x(τ) h(t −τ) is integrable.
While (5.2) does not make it apparent, the convolution is in fact symmetric in x
and h. Thus, the integral in (5.2) is deﬁned for a given t if, and only if, the integral
 ∞
−∞
h(σ) x(t −σ) dσ
(5.3)
is deﬁned. And if both are deﬁned, then their values are identical. This follows
directly by the change of variable σ ≜t −τ.
5.4
Thinking About the Convolution
Depending on the application, we can think about the convolution operation in a
number of diﬀerent ways.
(i) Especially when h(·) is nonnegative and integrates to one, one can think of
the convolution as an averaging, or smoothing, operation. Thus, when x is
convolved with h the result at time t0 is not x(t0) but rather a smoothed
version thereof, namely,
 ∞
−∞x(t0 −τ) h(τ) dτ. For example, if h is the map-
ping t 	→I{|t| ≤T/2}/T for some T > 0, then the convolution x ⋆h at time
t0 is not x(t0) but rather
1
T
 t0+T/2
t0−T/2
x(τ) dτ.
Thus, in this example, we can think of x ⋆h as being a “moving average,” or
a “sliding-window average” of x.
(ii) For energy-limited signals it is sometimes beneﬁcial to think about (x⋆h)(t0)
as the inner product between the functions τ 	→x(τ) and τ 	→h∗(t0 −τ):
(x ⋆h)(t0) =

τ 	→x(τ), τ 	→h∗(t0 −τ)

.
(5.4)
1On rare occasions we make exceptions for nonnegative integrands whose integral can be +∞.

56
Convolutions and Filters
(iii) Another useful informal way is to think about x ⋆h as a limit of expressions
of the form

j
(tj+1 −tj) h(tj) x(t −tj),
(5.5)
i.e., as a limit of linear combinations of the time shifts of x where the coeﬃ-
cients are determined by h.
5.5
When Is the Convolution Deﬁned?
There are a number of useful theorems providing suﬃcient conditions for the con-
volution’s existence. These theorems can be classiﬁed into two kinds: those that
guarantee that the convolution x ⋆h is deﬁned at every epoch t ∈R and those
that only guarantee that the convolution is deﬁned for all epochs t outside a set of
Lebesgue measure zero. Both types are useful. We begin with the former.
Convolution deﬁned for every t ∈R:
(i) A particularly simple case where the convolution is deﬁned at every time
instant t is when both x and h are energy-limited:
x, h ∈L2.
(5.6a)
In this case we can use (5.4) and the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (Theo-
rem 3.3.1) to conclude that the integral in (5.2) is deﬁned for every t ∈R
and that x ⋆h is a bounded function with
(x ⋆h)(t)
 ≤∥x∥2 ∥h∥2 ,
t ∈R.
(5.6b)
Indeed,
(x ⋆h)(t)
 =

τ 	→x(τ), τ 	→h∗(t −τ)

≤∥τ 	→x(τ)∥2 ∥τ 	→h∗(t −τ)∥2
= ∥x∥2 ∥h∥2 .
In fact, it can be shown that the result of convolving two energy-limited
signals is not only bounded but also uniformly continuous.2 (See, for example,
(Adams and Fournier, 2003, Paragraph 2.23).)
Note that even if both x and h are of ﬁnite energy, the convolution x ⋆h
need not be. However, if x, h are both of ﬁnite energy and if one of them
is additionally also integrable, then the convolution x ⋆h is a ﬁnite-energy
signal. Indeed,
∥x ⋆h∥2 ≤∥h∥1 ∥x∥2 ,
h ∈L1 ∩L2,
x ∈L2.
(5.7)
For a proof see, for example, (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 8, Exercise 4) or (Stein
and Weiss, 1971, Chapter 1, Section 1, Theorem 1.3).
2A function s: R →C is said to be uniformly continuous if for every ϵ > 0 there corresponds
some positive δ(ϵ) such that |s(ξ′) −s(ξ′′)| < ϵ whenever ξ′, ξ′′ ∈R are such that |ξ′ −ξ′′| < δ(ϵ).

5.5 When Is the Convolution Deﬁned?
57
(ii) Another simple case where the convolution is deﬁned at every epoch t ∈R is
when one of the functions is measurable and bounded and when the other is
integrable. For example, if
h ∈L1
(5.8a)
and if x is a Lebesgue measurable function that is bounded in the sense that
|x(t)| ≤σ∞,
t ∈R
(5.8b)
for some constant σ∞, then for every t ∈R the integrand in (5.3) is integrable
because |h(σ) x(t −σ)| ≤|h(σ)| σ∞, with the latter being integrable by our
assumption that h is integrable. The result of the convolution is a bounded
function because
|(x ⋆h)(t)| =

 ∞
−∞
h(τ) x(t −τ) dτ

≤
 ∞
−∞
h(τ) x(t −τ)
 dτ
≤σ∞∥h∥1 ,
t ∈R,
(5.8c)
where the ﬁrst inequality follows from Proposition 2.4.1, and where the second
inequality follows from (5.8b).
For this case too one can show that the result of the convolution is not only
bounded but also uniformly continuous.
(iii) Using H¨older’s Inequality (Theorem 3.3.2), we can generalize the above two
cases to show that whenever x and h satisfy the assumptions of H¨older’s
Inequality, their convolution is deﬁned at every epoch t ∈R and is, in fact,
a bounded uniformly continuous function.
See, for example, (Adams and
Fournier, 2003, Paragraph 2.23).
(iv) Another important case where the convolution is deﬁned at every time instant
will be discussed in Proposition 6.2.5. There it is shown that the convolution
between an integrable function (of time) with the Inverse Fourier Transform
of an integrable function (of frequency) is deﬁned at every time instant and
has a simple representation. This scenario is not as contrived as the reader
might suspect. It arises quite naturally, for example, when discussing the
lowpass ﬁltering of an integrable signal (Section 6.4.2). The impulse response
of an ideal lowpass ﬁlter (LPF) is not integrable, but it can be represented
as the Inverse Fourier Transform of an integrable function; see (6.35).
Regarding theorems that guarantee that the convolution be deﬁned for every t
outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero, we mention two.
Convolution deﬁned for t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero:
(i) If both x and h are integrable, then one can show (see, for example, (Rudin,
1987, Theorem 8.14), (Katznelson, 2004, Section VI.1), or (Stein and Weiss,
1971, Chapter 1, Section 1, Theorem 1.3)) that, for all t outside a set of
.007

58
Convolutions and Filters
Lebesgue measure zero, the mapping τ 	→x(τ) h(t −τ) is integrable, and
(x ⋆h)(t) is hence deﬁned. Moreover, irrespective of how we deﬁne (x ⋆h)(t)
for t inside the set of Lebesgue measure zero
∥x ⋆h∥1 ≤∥x∥1 ∥h∥1 ,
x, h ∈L1.
(5.9)
What is nice about this case is that the result of the convolution stays in
the same class of integrable functions. This makes it meaningful to discuss
associativity and other important properties of the convolution.
(ii) Another case where the convolution is deﬁned for all t outside a set of
Lebesgue measure zero is when h is integrable and when x is a measur-
able function for which τ 	→|x(τ)|p is integrable for some 1 ≤p < ∞. In this
case we have (see, for example, (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 8 Exercise 4) or (Stein
and Weiss, 1971, Chapter 1, Section 1, Theorem 1.3)) that for all t outside a
set of Lebesgue measure zero the mapping τ 	→x(τ) h(t −τ) is integrable so
for such t the convolution (x ⋆h)(t) is well-deﬁned.3 Moreover, irrespective
of how we deﬁne (x ⋆h)(t) for t inside the set of Lebesgue measure zero

(5.10)
This inequality is a special case of Young’s Inequality of Theorem 5.11.1
ahead. It can be written more compactly as
∥x ⋆h∥p ≤∥h∥1 ∥x∥p ,
p ≥1,
(5.11)
where we use the notation that for any measurable function g and p > 0

5.6
Basic Properties of the Convolution
The main properties of the convolution are summarized in the following theorem.
Theorem 5.6.1 (Properties of the Convolution). The convolution is

where the above hold for all g, h, x ∈L1, and α, β ∈C.
Some of these properties hold under more general or diﬀerent sets of assumptions,
so the reader should focus here on the properties rather than on the restrictions.

5.7 Filters
59
5.7
Filters
A ﬁlter of impulse response h
is a physical device that when fed the input
waveform x produces the output waveform h⋆x. The impulse response h is assumed
to be a real or complex signal, and it is tacitly assumed that we only feed the device
with inputs x for which the convolution x ⋆h is deﬁned.4
Deﬁnition 5.7.1 (Stable Filter). A ﬁlter is said to be stable if its impulse response
is integrable.
Stable ﬁlters are also called bounded-input/bounded-output stable or BIBO
stable, because, as the next proposition shows, if such ﬁlters are fed a bounded
signal, then their output is also a bounded signal.
Proposition 5.7.2 (BIBO Stability). If h is integrable and if x is a bounded
Lebesgue measurable signal, then the signal x ⋆h is also bounded.
Proof. If the impulse response h is integrable, and if the input x is bounded by
some constant σ∞, then (5.8a) and (5.8b) are both satisﬁed, and the boundedness
of the output then follows from (5.8c).
Deﬁnition 5.7.3 (Causal Filter). A ﬁlter of impulse response h is said to be causal
or nonanticipative if h is zero at negative times, i.e., if
h(t) = 0,
t < 0.
(5.13)
Causal ﬁlters play an important role in engineering because (5.13) guarantees that
the present ﬁlter output be computable from the past ﬁlter inputs. Indeed, the
time-t ﬁlter output can be expressed in the form
(x ⋆h)(t) =
 ∞
−∞
x(τ) h(t −τ) dτ
=
 t
−∞
x(τ) h(t −τ) dτ,
h causal,
where the calculation of the latter integral only requires knowledge of x(τ) for
τ < t. Here the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of the convolution (5.2),
and the second equality follows from (5.13).
5.8
The Matched Filter
In Digital Communications inner products are often computed using a matched
ﬁlter. In its deﬁnition we shall use the notation (5.1).
4This deﬁnition of a ﬁlter is reminiscent of the concept of a “linear time invariant system.”
Note, however, that since we do not deal with Dirac’s Delta in this book, our deﬁnition is more
restrictive. For example, a device that produces at its output a waveform that is identical to its
input is excluded from our discussion here because we do not allow h to be Dirac’s Delta.

Convolutions and Filters
Deﬁnition 5.8.1 (The Matched Filter). The matched ﬁlter for the signal φ is
a ﬁlter whose impulse response is ~φ∗, i.e., the mapping
t 	→φ∗(−t).
(5.14)
The main use of the matched ﬁlter is for computing inner products:
Theorem 5.8.2 (Computing Inner Products with a Matched Filter). The inner
product ⟨u, φ⟩between the energy-limited signals u and φ is given by the output at
time t = 0 of a matched ﬁlter for φ that is fed u:
⟨u, φ⟩=

u ⋆~φ∗
(0),
u, φ ∈L2.
(5.15)
More generally, if g: t 	→φ(t−t0), then ⟨u, g⟩is the time-t0 output of the matched
ﬁlter for φ that is fed u:
 ∞
−∞
u(t) φ∗(t −t0) dt =

u ⋆~φ∗
(t0).
(5.16)
Proof. We shall prove the second part of the theorem, i.e., (5.16): the ﬁrst follows
from the second by setting t0 = 0. We express the time-t0 output of the matched
ﬁlter as

u ⋆~φ∗
(t0) =
 ∞
−∞
u(τ) ~φ∗(t0 −τ) dτ
=
 ∞
−∞
u(τ) φ∗(τ −t0) dτ,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of convolution (5.2) and the
second from the deﬁnition of ~φ∗as the conjugated mirror image of φ.
From the above theorem we see that if we wish to compute, say, the three inner
products ⟨u, g1⟩, ⟨u, g2⟩, and ⟨u, g3⟩in the very special case where the functions
g1, g2, g3 are all time shifts of the same waveform φ, i.e., when g1 : t 	→φ(t −t1),
g2 : t 	→φ(t −t2), and g3 : t 	→φ(t −t3), then we need only one ﬁlter, namely, the
matched ﬁlter for φ. Indeed, we can feed u to the matched ﬁlter for φ and the
inner products ⟨u, g1⟩, ⟨u, g2⟩, and ⟨u, g3⟩simply correspond to the ﬁlter’s outputs
at times t1, t2, and t3. One circuit computes all three inner products. This is so
exciting that it is worth repeating:
Corollary 5.8.3 (Computing Many Inner Products Using One Filter). If the
energy-limited signals {gj}J
j=1 are all time shifts of the same signal φ in the sense
that
gj : t 	→φ(t −tj),
j = 1, . . . , J,
and if u is any energy-limited signal, then all J inner products
⟨u, gj⟩,
j = 1, . . . , J

can be computed using one ﬁlter by feeding u to a matched ﬁlter for φ and sampling
the output at the appropriate times t1, . . . , tJ:
⟨u, gj⟩=

u ⋆~φ∗
(tj),
j = 1, . . . , J.
(5.17)
5.9
The Ideal Unit-Gain Lowpass Filter
The impulse response of the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀfrequency Wc
is denoted by LPFWc(·) and is given for every Wc > 0 by5
LPFWc(t) ≜

2Wc
sin(2πWct)
2πWct
if t ̸= 0,
2Wc
if t = 0,
t ∈R.
(5.18)
This can be alternatively written as
LPFWc(t) = 2Wc sinc(2Wct),
t ∈R,
(5.19)
where the function sinc(·) is deﬁned by6
sinc(ξ) ≜
 sin(πξ)
πξ
if ξ ̸= 0,
1
if ξ = 0,
ξ ∈R.
(5.20)
Notice that the deﬁnition of sinc(0) as being 1 makes sense because, for very small
(but nonzero) values of ξ the value of sin(ξ)/ξ is approximately 1. In fact, with
this deﬁnition at zero the function is not only continuous at zero but also inﬁnitely
diﬀerentiable there. Indeed, the function from C to C
z 	→
 sin(πz)
πz
if z ̸= 0,
1
otherwise,
is an entire function, i.e., an analytic function throughout the complex plane.
The importance of the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter will become clearer when we
discuss the ﬁlter’s frequency response in Section 6.3. It is thus named because
the Fourier Transform of LPFWc(·) is equal to 1 (hence “unit gain”), whenever
|f| ≤Wc, and is equal to zero, whenever |f| > Wc. See (6.38) ahead.
From a mathematical point of view, working with the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter
is tricky because the impulse response (5.18) is not an integrable function. (It
decays like 1/t, which does not have a ﬁnite integral from t = 1 to t = ∞.) This
ﬁlter is thus not a stable ﬁlter. We shall revisit this issue in Section 6.4. Note,
however, that the impulse response (5.18) is of ﬁnite energy. (The square of the
impulse response decays like 1/t2 which does have a ﬁnite integral from one to
inﬁnity.) Consequently, the result of feeding an energy-limited signal to the ideal
unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter is always well-deﬁned.
Note also that the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter is not causal.
5For convenience we deﬁne the impulse response of the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀ
frequency zero as the all zero signal. This is in agreement with (5.19).
6Some texts omit the π’s in (5.20) and deﬁne the sinc(·) function as sin(ξ)/ξ for ξ ̸= 0.

Convolutions and Filters
5.10
The Ideal Unit-Gain Bandpass Filter
The ideal unit-gain bandpass ﬁlter (BPF) of bandwidth W around the carrier
frequency fc, where fc > W/2 > 0 is a ﬁlter of impulse response BPFW,fc(·),
where
BPFW,fc(t) ≜2W cos(2πfct) sinc(Wt),
t ∈R.
(5.21)
This ﬁlter too is nonstable and noncausal. It derives its name from its frequency
response (discussed in Section 6.3 ahead), which is equal to one at frequencies f
satisfying
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2 and which is equal to zero at all other frequencies.
5.11
Young’s Inequality
Many of the inequalities regarding convolutions are special cases of a result known
as Young’s Inequality. Recalling (5.12), we can state Young’s Inequality as follows.
Theorem 5.11.1 (Young’s Inequality). Let x and h be Lebesgue measurable func-
tions such that ∥x∥p , ∥h∥q < ∞for some 1 ≤p, q < ∞satisfying 1/p + 1/q > 1.
Deﬁne r through 1/p + 1/q = 1 + 1/r. Then the convolution integral (5.2) is de-
ﬁned for all t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero; it is a Lebesgue measurable
function; and
∥x ⋆h∥r ≤K ∥x∥p ∥h∥q ,
(5.22)
where K < 1 is some constant that depends only on p and q.
Proof. See (Adams and Fournier, 2003, Corollary 2.25). Alternatively, see (Stein
and Weiss, 1971, Chapter 5, Section 1) where it is derived from the M. Riesz
Convexity Theorem.

Chapter 6
The Frequency Response of Filters and
Bandlimited Signals
6.1
Introduction
We begin this chapter with a review of the Fourier Transform and its key properties.
We then use these properties to deﬁne the frequency response of ﬁlters, to discuss
the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter, and to deﬁne bandlimited signals.
6.2
Review of the Fourier Transform
6.2.1
On Hats, 2π’s, ω’s, and f’s
We denote the Fourier Transform (FT) of a (possibly complex) signal x(·) by
ˆx(·). Some other books denote it by X(·), but we prefer our notation because,
where possible, we use lowercase letters for deterministic quantities and reserve
uppercase letters for random quantities. In places where convention forces us to
use uppercase letters for deterministic quantities, we try to use a special font, e.g.,
P for power, W for bandwidth, or A for a deterministic matrix.
More importantly, our deﬁnition of the Fourier Transform may be diﬀerent from
the one you are used to.
Deﬁnition 6.2.1 (Fourier Transform). The Fourier Transform (or the L1-
Fourier Transform) of an integrable signal x: R →C is the mapping ˆx: R →C
deﬁned by
ˆx: f 	→
 ∞
−∞
x(t) e−i2πft dt.
(6.1)
(The FT can also be deﬁned in more general settings. For example, in Section 6.2.3
it will be deﬁned via a limiting argument for ﬁnite-energy signals that are not
integrable.)
This deﬁnition should be contrasted with the deﬁnition
X(iω) =
 ∞
−∞
x(t) e−iωt dt,

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
which you may have seen before. Note the 2π, which appears in the exponent in
our deﬁnition (6.1) and not in (6.2). We apologize to readers who are used to (6.2)
for forcing a new deﬁnition, but we have some good reasons:
(i) With our deﬁnition, the transform and its inverse are very similar; see (6.1)
and (6.4) below. If one uses the deﬁnition of (6.2), then the expression for
the Inverse Fourier Transform requires scaling the integral by 1/(2π).
(ii) With our deﬁnition, the Fourier Transform and the Inverse Fourier Transform
of a symmetric function are the same; see (6.6).
This makes it easier to
remember some Fourier pairs.
(iii) As we shall state more precisely in Section 6.2.2 and Section 6.2.3, with our
deﬁnition the Fourier Transform possesses an extremely important property:
it preserves inner products
⟨u, v⟩= ⟨ˆu, ˆv⟩
(certain restrictions apply).
Again, no 2π’s.
(iv) If x(·) models a function of time, then ˆx(·) becomes a function of frequency.
Thus, it is natural to use the generic argument t for such signals x(·) and the
generic argument f for their transforms. It is more common these days to
describe tones in terms of their frequencies (i.e., in Hz) and not in terms of
their radial frequency (in radians per second).
(v) It seems that all books on communications use our deﬁnition, perhaps because
people are used to setting their radios in Hz, kHz, or MHz.
Plotting the FT of a signal is tricky, because it is a complex-valued function. This
is generally true even for real signals.
However, for any integrable real signal
x: R →R the Fourier Transform ˆx(·) is conjugate-symmetric, i.e.,

ˆx(−f) = ˆx∗(f),
f ∈R

,
x ∈L1 is real-valued.
(6.3)
Equivalently, the magnitude of the FT of an integrable real signal is symmetric, and
the argument is anti-symmetric.1 (The reverse statement is “essentially” correct.
If ˆx is conjugate-symmetric then the set of epochs t for which x(t) is not real is
of Lebesgue measure zero.) Consequently, when plotting the FT of a “generic”
real signal we shall plot a symmetric function, but with solid lines for the positive
frequencies and dashed lines for the negative frequencies. This is to remind the
reader that the FT of a real signal is not symmetric but conjugate-symmetric. See,
for example, Figures 7.1 and 7.2 for plots of the Fourier Transforms of real signals.
When plotting the FT of a complex-valued signal, we shall use a generic plot that
is “highly asymmetric,” using solid lines. See, for example, Figure 7.4 for the FT
of a complex signal.
1The argument of a nonzero complex number z is deﬁned as the element θ of [−π, π) such
that z = |z| eiθ.

6.2 Review of the Fourier Transform
67
Deﬁnition 6.2.2 (Inverse Fourier Transform). The Inverse Fourier Transform
(IFT) of an integrable function g: R →C is denoted by ˇg and is deﬁned by
ˇg: t 	→
 ∞
−∞
g(f) ei2πft df.
(6.4)
We emphasize that the word “inverse” here is just part of the name of the transform.
Applying the IFT to the FT of a signal does not always recover the signal.2 (Condi-
tions under which the IFT does recover the signal are explored in Theorem 6.2.13.)
However, if one does not insist on using the IFT, then every integrable signal can
be reconstructed to within indistinguishability from its FT; see Theorem 6.2.12.
Proposition 6.2.3 (Some Properties of the Inverse Fourier Transform).
(i) If g is integrable, then its IFT is the FT of its mirror image
ˇg = ˆ~g,
g ∈L1.
(6.5)
(ii) If g is integrable and also symmetric in the sense that ~g = g, then the IFT
of g is equal to its FT
ˆg = ˇg,

g ∈L1 and ~g = g

.
(6.6)
(iii) If g is integrable and ˇg is also integrable, then
ˆˇg = ˇˆg.
(6.7)
Proof. Part (i) follows by a simple change of integration variable:
ˇg(ξ) =
 ∞
−∞
g(α) ei2παξ dα = −
 −∞
∞
g(−β) e−i2πβξ dβ
=
 ∞
−∞
~g(β) e−i2πβξ dβ
= ˆ~g(ξ),
ξ ∈R,
where we have changed the integration variable to β ≜−α.
Part (ii) is a special case of Part (i). To prove Part (iii) we compute
ˆˇg(ξ) =
 ∞
−∞
	 ∞
−∞
g(f) ei2πft df

e−i2πξt dt
=
 ∞
−∞
ˆg(−t) e−i2πξt dt
=
 ∞
−∞
ˆg(τ) ei2πξτ dτ
= ˇˆg(ξ),
ξ ∈R,
2This can be seen by considering the signal t →I{t = 17}, which is zero everywhere except
at 17 where it takes on the value 1. Its FT is zero at all frequencies, but if one applies the IFT to
the all-zero function one obtains the all-zero function, which is not the function we started with.
Things could be much worse. The FT of some integrable signals (such as the signal t →I{|t| ≤1})
is not integrable, so the IFT of their FT is not even deﬁned.

also know its IFT.

6.2.2
Parseval-like Theorems
A key result on the Fourier Transform is that, subject to some restrictions, it pre-
serves inner products. Thus, if ˆx1 and ˆx2 are the Fourier Transforms of x1 and x2,
then the inner product ⟨x1, x2⟩between x1 and x2 is typically equal to the inner
product ⟨ˆx1, ˆx2⟩between their transforms. In this section we shall describe two
scenarios where this holds. A third scenario, which is described in Theorem 6.2.9,
will have to wait until we discuss the FT of signals that are energy-limited but not
integrable.
To see how the next proposition is related to the preservation of the inner product
under the Fourier Transform, think about g as being a function of frequency and
of its IFT ˇg as a function of time.
Proposition 6.2.4. If g: f 	→g(f) and x: t 	→x(t) are integrable mappings from R
to C, then

6.2 Review of the Fourier Transform

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of ˇg; the second because the
conjugation of an integral is accomplished by conjugating the integrand (Proposi-
tion 2.3.1); the third by changing the order of integration; and the ﬁnal equality
by the deﬁnition of the FT of x.
A related result is that the convolution of an integrable function with the IFT of
an integrable function is always deﬁned:
Proposition 6.2.5. If the mappings x: t 	→x(t) and g: f 	→g(f) from R to C are
both integrable, then the convolution x ⋆ˇg is deﬁned at every epoch t ∈R and

x ⋆ˇg

(t) =
 ∞
−∞
g(f) ˆx(f) ei2πft df,

 ∞
−∞
x(τ) e−i2πfτ dτ df
=
 ∞
−∞
g(f) ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of the convolution; the second
from the deﬁnition of the IFT; the third by changing the order of integration; and
the ﬁnal equality by the deﬁnition of the FT. The justiﬁcation of the changing of the
order of integration can be argued using Fubini’s Theorem because, by assumption,
both g and x are integrable.
We next present another useful version of the preservation of inner products under
the FT. It is useful for functions (of time) that are zero outside some interval
[−T, T ] or for the IFT of functions (of frequency) that are zero outside an interval
[−W, W ].

6.2.3
The L2-Fourier Transform
To appreciate some of the mathematical subtleties of this section, the reader is
encouraged to review Section 4.7 in order to recall the diﬀerence between the
space L2 and the space L2 and in order to recall the diﬀerence between an energy-
limited signal x ∈L2 and the equivalence class [x] ∈L2 to which it belongs. In this
section we shall sketch how the Fourier Transform is deﬁned for elements of L2.
This section can be skipped provided that you are willing to take on faith that
such a transform exists and that, very roughly speaking, it has some of the same
properties of the Fourier Transform of Deﬁnition 6.2.1. To diﬀerentiate between
the transform of Deﬁnition 6.2.1 and the transform that we are about to deﬁne
for elements of L2, we shall refer in this section to the former as the L1-Fourier
Transform and to the latter as the L2-Fourier Transform. Both will be denoted
by a “hat.” In subsequent sections the Fourier Transform will be understood to be
the L1-Fourier Transform unless explicitly otherwise speciﬁed.

6.2 Review of the Fourier Transform
71
Some readers may have already encountered the L2-Fourier Transform without
even being aware of it. For example, the sinc(·) function, which is deﬁned in (5.20),
is an energy-limited signal that is not integrable.
Consequently, its L1-Fourier
Transform is undeﬁned. Nevertheless, you may have seen its Fourier Transform
being given as the Brickwall function. As we shall see, this is somewhat in line
with how the L2-Fourier Transform of the sinc(·) is deﬁned.3
For more on the
Fourier Transform of the sinc(·) see Section 6.2.5. Another example of an energy-
limited signal that is not integrable is t 	→1/(1 + |t|).
We next sketch how the L2-Fourier Transform is deﬁned and explore some of its
key properties. We begin with the bad news.
(i) There is no explicit simple expression for the L2-Fourier Transform.
(ii) The result of applying the transform is not a function but an equivalence
class of functions.
The L2-Fourier Transform is a mapping
ˆ: L2 →L2
that maps elements of L2 to elements of L2. It thus maps equivalence classes
to equivalence classes, not functions.
As long as the operation we perform on
the result of the L2-Fourier Transform does not depend on which member of the
equivalence class it is performed on, there is no need to worry about this issue.
Otherwise, we can end up performing operations that are ill-deﬁned. For example,
an operation that is ill-deﬁned is evaluating the result of the transform at a given
frequency, say at f = 17.
An operation you cannot go wrong with is integration, because the integrals of
two functions that diﬀer on a set of measure zero are equal; see Proposition 2.5.3.
Consequently, inner products, which are deﬁned via integration, are ﬁne too. In
this book we shall therefore refrain from applying to the result of the L2-Fourier
Transform any operation other than integration (or related operations such as the
computation of energy or inner product).
In fact, since we ﬁnd the notion of
equivalence classes somewhat abstract we shall try to minimize its use.
Suppose that x ∈L2 is an energy-limited signal and that [x] ∈L2 is its equivalence
class. How do we deﬁne the L2-Fourier Transform of [x]? We ﬁrst deﬁne for every
positive integer n the time-truncated function
xn : t 	→x(t) I{|t| ≤n}
and note that, by Proposition 3.4.3, xn is integrable. Consequently, its L1-Fourier
Transform ˆxn is well-deﬁned and is given by
ˆxn(f) =
 n
−n
x(t) e−i2πft dt,
f ∈R.
3However, as we shall see, the result of the L2 -Fourier Transform is an element of L2 , i.e., an
equivalence class, and not a function.

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
We then note that ∥x −xn∥2 tends to zero as n tends to inﬁnity, so for every ϵ > 0
there exists some L(ϵ) suﬃciently large so that
∥xn −xm∥2 < ϵ,
n, m > L(ϵ).
(6.13)
Applying Proposition 6.2.6 (ii) with the substitution of max{n, m} for T and of
xn −xm for both x1 and x2, we obtain that (6.13) implies
∥ˆxn −ˆxm∥2 < ϵ,
n, m > L(ϵ).
(6.14)
Because the space of energy-limited signals is complete in the sense of Theo-
rem 8.6.1 ahead, we may infer from (6.14) that there exists some function ζ ∈L2
such that ∥ˆxn −ζ∥2 converges to zero.4 We then deﬁne the L2-Fourier Transform
of the equivalence class [x] to be the equivalence class [ζ]. In view of Footnote 4
we can deﬁne the L2-Fourier Transform as follows.
Deﬁnition 6.2.7 (L2-Fourier Transform). The L2-Fourier Transform of the
equivalence class [x] ∈L2 is denoted by  
[x] and is given by
 
[x] ≜

.
The main properties of the L2-Fourier Transform are summarized in the following
theorem.
Theorem 6.2.8 (Properties of the L2-Fourier Transform). The L2-Fourier Trans-
form is a mapping from L2 onto L2 with the following properties:
(i) If x ∈L2 ∩L1, then the L2-Fourier Transform of [x] is the equivalence class
of the mapping
f 	→
 ∞
−∞
x(t) e−i2πft dt.
(ii) The L2-Fourier Transform is linear in the sense that

α[x1] + β[x2] = α "
[x1] + β "
[x2],

x1, x2 ∈L2,
α, β ∈C

.
(iii) The L2-Fourier Transform is invertible in the sense that to each [g] ∈L2
there corresponds a unique equivalence class in L2 whose L2-Fourier Trans-
form is [g]. This equivalence class can be obtained by reﬂecting each of the el-
ements of [g] to obtain the equivalence class [~g] of ~g, and by then applying the
L2-Fourier Transform to it. The result

Identity (6.16) appears in this form in (Stein and Weiss, 1971, Chapter 1, Section 2,
Theorem 2.4).
The result that the L2-Fourier Transform preserves energies is sometimes called
Plancherel’s Theorem and the result that it preserves inner products Parseval’s
Theorem. We shall use “Parseval’s Theorem” for both. It is so important that
we repeat it here in the form of a theorem. Following mathematical practice, we
drop the square brackets in the theorem’s statement.
Theorem 6.2.9 (Parseval’s Theorem). For any x, y ∈L2

∥x∥2 = ∥ˆx∥2 .

As we mentioned earlier, there is no simple explicit expression for the L2-Fourier
Transform. The following proposition simpliﬁes its calculation under certain as-
sumptions that are, for example, satisﬁed by the sinc(·) function.
Proposition 6.2.10. If x = ˇg for some g ∈L1 ∩L2, then:
(i) x ∈L2.

where the ﬁrst equality follows from (6.15); the second from Theorem 6.2.8 (i)

equality from Proposition 6.2.3 (i) and from the hypothesis that x = ˇg.
6.2.4
More on the Fourier Transform
In this section we present additional results that shed some light on the problem of
reconstructing a signal from its FT. The ﬁrst is a continuity result, which may seem
technical but which has some useful consequences. It can be used to show that the
IFT (of an integrable function) always yields a continuous signal. Consequently,
if one starts with a discontinuous function, takes its FT, and then the IFT, one
does not obtain the original function. It can also be used—once we deﬁne the
frequency response of a ﬁlter in Section 6.3—to show that no stable ﬁlter can have
a discontinuous frequency response.
Theorem 6.2.11 (Continuity and Boundedness of the Fourier Transform).
(i) If x is integrable, then its FT ˆx is a uniformly continuous function satisfying
ˆx(f)
 ≤
 ∞
−∞
|x(t)| dt,
f ∈R,
(6.21)
and
lim
|f|→∞ˆx(f) = 0.
(6.22)
(ii) If g is integrable, then its IFT ˇg is a uniformly continuous function satisfying
ˇg(t)
 ≤
 ∞
−∞
|g(f)| df,
t ∈R.
(6.23)
Proof. We begin with Part (i). Inequality (6.21) follows directly from the deﬁnition
of the FT and from Proposition 2.4.1. The proof of the uniform continuity of ˆx is
not very diﬃcult but is omitted. See (Katznelson, 2004, Section VI.1, Theorem 1.2).
A proof of (6.22) can be found in (Katznelson, 2004, Section VI.1, Theorem 1.7).
Part (ii) follows by substituting ~g for x in Part (i) because the IFT of g is the FT
of its mirror image (6.5).

6.2 Review of the Fourier Transform
75
The second result we present is that every integrable signal can be reconstructed
from its FT, but not necessarily via the IFT. The reconstruction formula in (6.25)
ahead works even when the IFT does not do the job.
Theorem 6.2.12 (Reconstructing a Signal from Its Fourier Transform).
(i) If two integrable signals have the same FT, then they are indistinguishable:

ˆx1(f) = ˆx2(f),
f ∈R

=⇒

x1 ≡x2

,
x1, x2 ∈L1.
(6.24)
(ii) Every integrable function x can be reconstructed from its FT in the sense that
lim

x(t) −
 λ


ˆx(f) ei2πft df
 dt = 0.
(6.25)
Proof. See (Katznelson, 2004, Chapter VI, Section 1.10).
Conditions under which the IFT of the FT of a signal recovers the signal are given
in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.2.13 (The Inversion Theorem).
(i) Suppose that x is integrable and that its FT ˆx is also integrable. Deﬁne
˜x = ˇˆx.
(6.26)
Then ˜x is a continuous function with
lim
|t|→∞˜x(t) = 0,
(6.27)
and the functions x and ˜x agree except on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
(ii) Suppose that g is integrable and that its IFT ˇg is also integrable. Deﬁne
˜g = ˆˇg.
(6.28)
Then ˜g is a continuous function with
lim
|f|→∞˜g(f) = 0
(6.29)
and the functions g and ˜g agree except on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
Proof. For a proof of Part (i) see (Rudin, 1987, Theorem 9.11). Part (ii) follows
by substituting g for x in Part (i) and using Proposition 6.2.3 (iii).
Corollary 6.2.14.
(i) If x is a continuous integrable signal whose FT is integrable, then
ˇˆx = x.

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
(ii) If g is continuous and integrable, and if ˇg is also integrable, then
ˆˇg = g.
(6.31)
Proof. Part (i) follows from Theorem 6.2.13 (i) by noting that if two continuous
functions are equal outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero, then they are identical.
Part (ii) follows similarly from Theorem 6.2.13 (ii).
6.2.5
On the Brickwall and the sinc(·) Functions
We next discuss the FT and the IFT of the Brickwall function
ξ 	→I{|ξ| ≤1},
(6.32)
which derives its name from the shape of its plot. Since it is a symmetric function,
it follows from (6.6) that its FT and IFT are identical. Both are equal to a properly
stretched and scaled sinc(·) function (5.20).
More generally, we oﬀer the reader advice on how to remember that for α, γ > 0,
t 	→δ sinc(αt) is the IFT of f 	→β I{|f| ≤γ}
(6.33)
if, and only if,
δ = 2γβ
(6.34a)
and
γ 1
α = 1
2.
(6.34b)
Condition (6.34a) is easily remembered because its LHS is the value at t = 0 of
δ sinc(αt) and its RHS is the value at t = 0 of the IFT of f 	→β I{|f| ≤γ}:
 ∞
−∞
β I{|f| ≤γ} ei2πft df

t=0
=
 ∞
−∞
β I{|f| ≤γ} df = 2γβ.
Condition (6.34b) is intimately related to the Sampling Theorem that you may
have already seen and that we shall discuss in Chapter 8. Indeed, in the Sam-
pling Theorem (Theorem 8.4.3) the time between consecutive samples T and the
bandwidth W satisfy
T W = 1
2.
(In this application α corresponds to 1/T and γ corresponds to the bandwidth W.)
It is tempting to say that Conditions (6.34) also imply that the FT of the func-
tion t 	→δ sinc(αt) is the function f 	→β I{|f| ≤γ}, but there is a caveat. The
signal t 	→δ sinc(αt) is not integrable. Consequently, its L1-Fourier Transform
(Deﬁnition 6.2.1) is undeﬁned. However, since it is energy-limited, its L2-Fourier
Transform is deﬁned (Deﬁnition 6.2.7). Using Proposition 6.2.10 with the substitu-
tion of f 	→β I{|f| ≤γ} for g, we obtain that, indeed, Conditions (6.34) imply that
the L2-Fourier Transform of the (equivalence class of the) function t 	→δ sinc(αt)
is the (equivalence class of the) function f 	→β I{|f| ≤γ}.

6.3
The Frequency Response of a Filter
Recall that in Section 5.7 we deﬁned a ﬁlter of impulse response h to be a physical
device that when fed the input x produces the output x⋆h. Of course, this is only
meaningful if the convolution is deﬁned. Subject to some technical assumptions
that are made precise in Theorem 6.3.2, the FT of the output waveform x⋆h is the
product of the FT of the input waveform x by the FT of the impulse response h.

78
The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
Consequently, we can think of a ﬁlter of impulse response h as a physical device
that produces an output signal whose FT is the product of the FT of the input
signal and the FT of the impulse response.
The FT of the impulse response is called the frequency response of the ﬁlter. If
the ﬁlter is stable and its impulse response therefore integrable, then we deﬁne the
ﬁlter’s frequency response as the Fourier Transform of the impulse response using
Deﬁnition 6.2.1 (the L1-Fourier Transform). If the impulse response is energy-
limited but not integrable, then we deﬁne the frequency response as the Fourier
Transform of the impulse response using the deﬁnition of the Fourier Transform for
energy-limited signals that are not integrable as in Section 6.2.3 (the L2-Fourier
Transform).
Deﬁnition 6.3.1 (Frequency Response).
(i) The frequency response of a stable ﬁlter is the Fourier Transform of its
impulse response as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6.2.1.
(ii) The frequency response of an unstable ﬁlter whose impulse response is
energy-limited is the L2-Fourier Transform of its impulse response as deﬁned
in Section 6.2.3 (Deﬁnition 6.2.7).
As discussed in Section 5.5, if x, h are both integrable, then x ⋆h is deﬁned at
all epochs t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero, and x ⋆h is integrable. In
this case the FT of x ⋆h is the mapping f 	→ˆx(f) ˆh(f). If x is integrable and
h is of ﬁnite energy, then x ⋆h is also deﬁned at all epochs t outside a set of
Lebesgue measure zero. But in this case the convolution is only guaranteed to be
of ﬁnite energy; it need not be integrable. We can discuss its Fourier Transform
using the deﬁnition of the L2-Fourier Transform for energy-limited signals that are
not integrable as in Section 6.2.3. In this case, again, the L2-Fourier Transform of
x ⋆h is the (equivalence class of the) mapping f 	→ˆx(f) ˆh(f):7
Theorem 6.3.2 (The Fourier Transform of a Convolution).
(i) If the signals h and x are both integrable, then the convolution x⋆h is deﬁned
for all t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero; it is integrable; and its
L1-Fourier Transform 
x ⋆h is given by

x ⋆h(f) = ˆx(f) ˆh(f),
f ∈R,
(6.36)
where ˆx and ˆh are the L1-Fourier Transforms of x and h.
(ii) If the signal x is integrable and if h is of ﬁnite energy, then the convolution
x ⋆h is deﬁned for all t outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero; it is energy-
limited; and its L2-Fourier Transform 
x ⋆h is also given by (6.36) with ˆx,
7To be precise we should say that the L2 -Fourier Transform of x⋆h is the equivalence class of
the product of the L1 -Fourier Transform of x by any element in the equivalence class consisting
of the L2 -Fourier Transform of [h].

as before, being the L1-Fourier Transform of x but with ˆh now being the
L2-Fourier Transform of h.
Proof. For a proof of Part (i) see, for example, (Stein and Weiss, 1971, Chapter 1,
Section 1, Theorem 1.4).
For Part (ii) see (Stein and Weiss, 1971, Chapter 1,
Section 2, Theorem 2.6).
As an example, recall from Section 5.9 that the unit-gain ideal lowpass ﬁlter of
cutoﬀfrequency Wc is a ﬁlter of impulse response
h(t) = 2Wc sinc(2Wct),
t ∈R.
(6.37)
This ﬁlter is not causal and not stable, but its impulse response is energy-limited.
The ﬁlter’s frequency response is the L2-Fourier Transform of the impulse response
(6.37), which, using the results from Section 6.2.5, is given by (the equivalence class
of) the mapping
f 	→I{|f| ≤Wc},
f ∈R.
(6.38)
This mapping maps all frequencies f satisfying |f| > Wc to 0 and all frequencies
satisfying |f| ≤Wc to one. It is for this reason that we use the adjective “unit-gain”
in describing this ﬁlter. We denote the mapping in (6.38) by "
LPFWc(·) so
"
LPFWc(f) ≜I{|f| ≤Wc},
f ∈R.
(6.39)
This mapping is depicted in Figure 6.2. Note that Wc is the length of the interval
of positive frequencies where the response is one.
Turning to the ideal unit-gain bandpass ﬁlter of bandwidth W around the carrier
frequency fc satisfying fc ≥W/2, we note that, by (5.21), its time-t impulse
response BPFW,fc(t) is given by

Bandlimited Signals and Lowpass Filtering
In this section we deﬁne bandlimited signals and discuss lowpass ﬁltering.
We
treat energy-limited signals and integrable signals separately. As we shall see, any
integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz is also an energy-limited signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz (Note 6.4.12).
6.4.1
Energy-Limited Signals
The main result of this section is that the following three statements are equivalent:
(a) The signal x is an energy-limited signal satisfying
(x ⋆LPFW)(t) = x(t),
t ∈R.
(6.42)
(b) The signal x can be expressed in the form
x(t) =

|g(f)|2 df < ∞.
(6.43b)
(If (b) holds, then the LHS of (6.43b) must equal the energy in x.)

form ˆx satisﬁes
 ∞
−∞
|ˆx(f)|2 df =
 W
−W
|ˆx(f)|2 df.
(6.44)
We can thus deﬁne x to be an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz
if one (and hence all) of the above conditions hold.
In deriving this result we shall take (a) as the deﬁnition. We shall then establish
the equivalence (a) ⇔(b) in Proposition 6.4.5, which also establishes that the
function g in (6.43a) can be taken as any element in the equivalence class of the
L2-Fourier Transform of x, and that the LHS of (6.43b) is then ∥x∥2
2. Finally, we
shall establish the equivalence (a) ⇔(c) in Proposition 6.4.6.
We conclude the section with a summary of the key properties of the result of
passing an energy-limited signal through an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter.
We begin by deﬁning an energy-limited signal to be bandlimited to W Hz if it is
unaltered when it is lowpass ﬁltered by an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀ
frequency W.
Recalling that we are denoting by LPFW(t) the time-t impulse
response of an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀfrequency W (see (5.19)), we
have the following deﬁnition.8
Deﬁnition 6.4.1 (Energy-Limited Bandlimited Signals). We say that the signal x
is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz if x is in L2 and
(x ⋆LPFW)(t) = x(t),
t ∈R.
(6.45)
Note 6.4.2. If an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz is of zero
energy, then it is the all-zero signal 0.
Proof. Let x be an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz and that
has zero energy. Then
|x(t)| =
(x ⋆LPFW)(t)

≤∥x∥2 ∥LPFW∥2
= ∥x∥2
√
2W
= 0,
t ∈R,
8Even though the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀfrequency W is not stable, its impulse
response LPFW(·) is of ﬁnite energy (because it decays like 1/t and the integral of 1/t2 from
one to inﬁnity is ﬁnite). Consequently, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to prove that
if x ∈L2 then the mapping τ →x(τ) LPFW(t −τ) is integrable for every time instant t ∈R.
Consequently, the convolution x ⋆LPFW is deﬁned at every time instant t; see Section 5.5.

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
where the ﬁrst equality follows because x is an energy-limited signal that is band-
limited to W Hz and is thus unaltered when it is lowpass ﬁltered; the subsequent
inequality follows from (5.6b); the subsequent equality by computing ∥LPFW∥2
using Parseval’s Theorem and the explicit form of the frequency response of the
ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of bandwidth W (6.38); and where the ﬁnal equality
follows from the hypothesis that x is of zero energy.
Having deﬁned what it means for an energy-limited signal to be bandlimited to W
Hz, we can now deﬁne its bandwidth.9
Deﬁnition 6.4.3 (Bandwidth). The bandwidth of an energy-limited signal x is
the smallest frequency W to which x is bandlimited.
The next lemma shows that the result of passing an energy-limited signal through
an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀfrequency W is an energy-limited signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz.
Lemma 6.4.4.
(i) Let y = x ⋆LPFW be the output of an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀ
frequency W that is fed the energy-limited input x ∈L2. Then y ∈L2;
y(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R;
(6.46)
and the L2-Fourier Transform of y is the (equivalence class of the) mapping
f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W}.
(6.47)
(ii) If g: f 	→g(f) is a bounded integrable function and if x is energy-limited,
then x ⋆ˇg is in L2; it can be expressed as

x ⋆ˇg

(t) =
 ∞
−∞
ˆx(f) g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R;
(6.48)
and its L2-Fourier Transform is given by (the equivalence class of) the map-
ping f 	→ˆx(f) g(f).
Proof. Even though Part (i) is a special case of Part (ii) corresponding to g being
the mapping f 	→I{|f| ≤W}, we shall prove the two parts separately. We begin
with a proof of Part (i). The idea of the proof is to express for each t ∈R the
time-t output y(t) as an inner product and to then use Parseval’s Theorem. Thus,
9To be more rigorous we should use in this deﬁnition the term “inﬁmum” instead of “smallest,”
but it turns out that the inﬁmum here is also a minimum.

where the fourth equality follows from the symmetry of the function LPFW(·), and

Part (i) now follows from Proposition 6.2.10, because, by Parseval’s Theorem, the
mapping f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W} is of ﬁnite energy and hence, by Proposition 3.4.3,
also integrable.
We next turn to Part (ii). We ﬁrst note that the assumption that g is bounded
and integrable implies that it is also energy-limited, because if |g(f)| ≤σ∞for all
f ∈R, then |g(f)|2 ≤σ∞|g(f)| and

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
and by then applying Proposition 6.2.10 to the mapping f 	→g∗(f) e−i2πft, which
is in L1 ∩L2 by (6.49).
Having established (6.48), we next examine the integrand in (6.48) and note that
if |g(f)| is upper-bounded by σ∞, then the modulus of the integrand is upper-
bounded by σ∞|ˆx(f)|, so the assumption that x ∈L2 (and hence that ˆx is of
ﬁnite energy) guarantees that the integrand is square integrable.
Also, by the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, the square integrability of g and of ˆx implies that the
integrand is integrable. Thus, the integrand in (6.48) is both square integrable and
integrable so, by Proposition 6.2.10, the signal x ⋆ˇg is square integrable and its
Fourier Transform is the (equivalence class of the) mapping f 	→ˆx(f) g(f).
With the aid of the above lemma we can now give an equivalent deﬁnition for
energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to W Hz. This deﬁnition is popular
among mathematicians, because it does not involve the L2-Fourier Transform and
because the continuity of the signal is implied.
Proposition 6.4.5 (On the Deﬁnition of Bandlimited Functions in L2).
(i) If x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then it can be
expressed in the form
x(t) =
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R,
(6.51)
where g(·) satisﬁes
 W
−W
|g(f)|2 df < ∞
(6.52)
and can be taken as (any function in the equivalence class of) ˆx.
(ii) If a signal x can be expressed as in (6.51) for some function g(·) satisfying
(6.52), then x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz and ˆx
is (the equivalence class of) the mapping f 	→g(f) I{|f| ≤W}.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove Part (i). Let x be an energy-limited signal that is band-
limited to W Hz. Then
x(t) = (x ⋆LPFW)(t)
=
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from Deﬁnition 6.4.1, and where the second equality
follows from Lemma 6.4.4 (i). Consequently, if we pick g as (any element of the
equivalence class of) f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W}, then (6.51) will be satisﬁed and (6.52)
will follow from Parseval’s Theorem.
To prove Part (ii) deﬁne ˜g: f 	→g(f) I{|f| ≤W}. From the assumption (6.52) and
from Proposition 3.4.3 it then follows that ˜g ∈L1 ∩L2. This and (6.51) imply that
x ∈L2 and that the L2-Fourier Transform of (the equivalence class of) x is (the

equivalence class of) ˜g; see Proposition 6.2.10. To complete the proof of Part (ii)
it thus remains to show that x ⋆LPFW = x. This follows from the calculation:

x ⋆LPFW

(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df
=
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πft df
= x(t),
t ∈R,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from Lemma 6.4.4 (i); the second because we have
already established that the L2-Fourier Transform of (the equivalence class of) x is
(the equivalence class of) f 	→g(f) I{|f| ≤W}; and where the last equality follows
from (6.51).
In the engineering literature a function is often deﬁned as bandlimited to W Hz
if its FT is zero for frequencies f outside the interval [−W, W ]. This deﬁnition
is imprecise because the L2-Fourier Transform of a signal is an equivalence class
and its value at a given frequency is technically undeﬁned. It would be better to
deﬁne an energy-limited signal as bandlimited to W Hz if ∥x∥2
2 =
 W
−W
ˆx(f)
2 df
so “all its energy is contained in the frequency band [−W, W ].” However, this is
not quite equivalent to our deﬁnition. For example, the L2-Fourier Transform of
the discontinuous signal
x(t) =

17
if t = 0,
sinc 2Wt
otherwise,
is (the equivalence class of) the Brickwall (frequency domain) function
1
2W I{|f| ≤W},
f ∈R
(because the discontinuity at t = 0 does not inﬂuence the Fourier integral), but
the signal is altered by the lowpass ﬁlter, which smooths it out to produce the
continuous waveform t 	→sinc(2Wt). Readers who have already seen the Sampling
Theorem will note that the above signal x(·) provides a counterexample to the
Sampling Theorem as it is often imprecisely stated.
The following proposition clariﬁes the relationship between this deﬁnition and ours.
Proposition 6.4.6 (More on the Deﬁnition of Bandlimited Functions in L2).
(i) If x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then x is a
continuous function and all its energy is contained in the frequency interval
[−W, W ] in the sense that its L2-Fourier Transform ˆx satisﬁes

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
(ii) If the signal x ∈L2 satisﬁes (6.53), then x is indistinguishable from the
signal x ⋆LPFW, which is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W
Hz. If in addition to satisfying (6.53) the signal x is continuous, then x is
an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz.
Proof. This proposition’s claims are a subset of those of Proposition 6.4.7, which
summarizes some of the results relating to lowpass ﬁltering. The proof is therefore
omitted.
Proposition 6.4.7. Let y = x ⋆LPFW be the result of feeding the signal x ∈L2 to
an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀfrequency W. Then:
(i) y is energy-limited with
∥y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 .
(6.54)
(ii) y is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz.
(iii) Its L2-Fourier Transform ˆy is given by (the equivalence class of) the mapping
f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W}.
(iv) All the energy in y is concentrated in the frequency band [−W, W ] in the
sense that:
 ∞
−∞
|ˆy(f)|2 df =
 W
−W
|ˆy(f)|2 df.
(v) y can be represented as
y(t) =

t ∈R
(6.55)
=
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(6.56)
(vi) y is uniformly continuous.
(vii) If x ∈L2 has all its energy concentrated in the frequency band [−W, W ] in
the sense that
 ∞
−∞
|ˆx(f)|2 df =
 W
−W
|ˆx(f)|2 df,
(6.57)
then x is indistinguishable from the bandlimited signal x ⋆LPFW.
(viii) x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W if, and only if, it
satisﬁes all three of the following conditions: it is in L2; it is continuous;
and it satisﬁes (6.57).

87
Proof. Part (i) follows from Lemma 6.4.4 (i), which demonstrates that ˆy is (the
equivalence class of) the mapping f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W} so, by Parseval’s Theorem,
∥y∥2
2 =

 W
−W
|ˆx(f)|2 df

Part (ii) follows because, by Lemma 6.4.4 (i), the signal y satisﬁes
y(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df
where
 W
−W
|ˆx(f)|2 df ≤
 ∞
−∞
|ˆx(f)|2 df = ∥x∥2
2 < ∞,
so, by Proposition 6.4.5, y is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz.
Part (iii) follows directly from Lemma 6.4.4 (i). Part (iv) follows from Part (iii).
Part (v) follows, again, directly from Lemma 6.4.4.
Part (vi) follows from the representation (6.56); from the fact that the IFT of
integrable functions is uniformly continuous (Theorem 6.2.11); and because the
condition ∥x∥2 < ∞implies, by Proposition 3.4.3, that f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W} is
integrable.
To prove Part (vii) we note that by Part (ii) x ⋆LPFW is an energy-limited signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz, and we note that (6.57) implies that x is indistin-
guishable from x ⋆LPFW because

where the ﬁrst equality follows from Parseval’s Theorem; the second equality from
Lemma 6.4.4 (i); the third equality because the integrand is zero for |f| ≤W; and
the ﬁnal equality from (6.57).
To prove Part (viii) deﬁne y = x ⋆LPFW and note that if x is an energy-limited
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz then, by Deﬁnition 6.4.1, y = x so the continuity
of x and the fact that its energy is concentrated in the interval [−W, W ] follow from
Parts (iv) and (vi). In the other direction, if x satisﬁes (6.57) then by Part (vii)

it is indistinguishable from the signal y, which is continuous by Part (vi).
If,
additionally, x is continuous, then x must be identical to y because two continuous
functions that are indistinguishable must be identical.
6.4.2
Integrable Signals
We next discuss what we mean when we say that x is an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W Hz. Also important will be Note 6.4.11, which establishes that
if x is such a signal, then x is equal to the IFT of its FT.
Even though the ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter is unstable, its convolution with any
integrable signal is well-deﬁned. Denoting the cutoﬀfrequency by Wc we have:
Proposition 6.4.8. For any x ∈L1 the convolution integral
 ∞
−∞
x(τ) LPFWc(t −τ) dτ
is deﬁned at every epoch t ∈R and is given by
 ∞
−∞
x(τ) LPFWc(t −τ) dτ =
 Wc
−Wc
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(6.58)
Moreover, x ⋆LPFWc is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to Wc Hz.10
Its L2-Fourier Transform is (the equivalence class of) the mapping
f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤Wc}.
Proof. The key to the proof is to note that, although the sinc(·) function is not
integrable, it follows from (6.35) that it can be represented as the Inverse Fourier
Transform of an integrable function (of frequency). Consequently, the existence
of the convolution and its representation as (6.58) follow directly from Proposi-
tion 6.2.5 and (6.35).
To prove the remaining assertions of the proposition we note that, since x is inte-
grable, it follows from Theorem 6.2.11 that |ˆx(f)| ≤∥x∥1 and hence
 Wc
−Wc
|ˆx(f)|2 df < ∞.
(6.59)
The result now follows from (6.58), (6.59), and Proposition 6.4.5.
With the aid of Proposition 6.4.8 we can now deﬁne bandlimited integrable signals:
Deﬁnition 6.4.9 (Bandlimited Integrable Signals). We say that the signal x is
an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz if x is integrable and if it
is unaltered when it is lowpass ﬁltered by an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀ
frequency W:
x(t) = (x ⋆LPFW)(t),
t ∈R.
10Lowpass-ﬁltering an integrable signal need not produce an integrable signal (Exercise 6.20).

6.4 Bandlimited Signals and Lowpass Filtering
89
Proposition 6.4.10 (Characterizing Integrable Signals that Are Bandlimited to
W Hz). If x is an integrable signal, then each of the following statements is equiv-
alent to the statement that x is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz:
(a) The signal x is unaltered when it is lowpass ﬁltered:
x(t) = (x ⋆LPFW)(t),
t ∈R.
(6.60)
(b) The signal x can be expressed as
x(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(6.61)
(c) The signal x is continuous and
ˆx(f) = 0,
|f| > W.
(6.62)
(d) There exists an integrable function g such that
x(t) =
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(6.63)
Proof. Condition (a) is the condition given in Deﬁnition 6.4.9, so it only remains
to show that the four conditions are equivalent. We proceed to do so by proving
that (a) ⇔(b); that (b) ⇒(d); that (d) ⇒(c); and that (c) ⇒(b).
That (a) ⇔(b) follows directly from Proposition 6.4.8 and, more speciﬁcally, from
the representation (6.58). The implication (b) ⇒(d) is obvious because nothing
precludes us from picking g to be the mapping f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W}, which is
integrable because ˆx is bounded by ∥x∥1 (Theorem 6.2.11).
We next prove that (d) ⇒(c). We thus assume that there exists an integrable
function g such that (6.63) holds and proceed to prove that x is continuous and
that (6.62) holds. To that end we ﬁrst note that the integrability of g implies,
by Theorem 6.2.11, that x (= ˇg) is continuous. It thus remains to prove that ˆx
satisﬁes (6.62). Deﬁne g0 as the mapping f 	→g(f) I{|f| ≤W}. By (6.63) it then
follows that x = ˇg0. Consequently,
ˆx = ˆˇg0.
(6.64)
Employing Theorem 6.2.13 (ii) we conclude that the RHS of (6.64) is equal to g0
outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero, so (6.64) implies that ˆx is indistinguishable
from g0.
Since both ˆx and g0 are continuous for |f| > W, this implies that
ˆx(f) = g0(f) for all frequencies |f| > W.
Since, by its deﬁnition, g0(f) = 0
whenever |f| > W we can conclude that (6.62) holds.
Finally (c) ⇒(b) follows directly from Theorem 6.2.13 (i).
From Proposition 6.4.10 (cf. (b) and (c)) we obtain:

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
Note 6.4.11. If x is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then it is
equal to the IFT of its FT.
By Proposition 6.4.10 it also follows that if x is an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W Hz, then (6.61) is satisﬁed.
Since the integrand in (6.61) is
bounded (by ∥x∥1) it follows that the integrand is square integrable over the in-
terval [−W, W ]. Consequently, by Proposition 6.4.5, x must be an energy-limited
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz. We have thus proved:
Note 6.4.12. An integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz is also an energy-
limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz.
The reverse statement is not true: the sinc(·) is an energy-limited signal that is
bandlimited to 1/2 Hz, but it is not integrable.
The deﬁnition of bandwidth for integrable signals is similar to Deﬁnition 6.4.3.11
Deﬁnition 6.4.13 (Bandwidth). The bandwidth of an integrable signal is the
smallest frequency W to which it is bandlimited.
6.5
Bandlimited Signals Through Stable Filters
In this section we discuss the result of feeding bandlimited signals to stable ﬁlters.
We begin with energy-limited signals. In Theorem 6.3.2 we saw that the convo-
lution of an integrable signal with an energy-limited signal is deﬁned at all times
outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero. The next proposition shows that if the
energy-limited signal is bandlimited to W Hz, then the convolution is deﬁned at
every time, and the result is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz.
Proposition 6.5.1. Let x be an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz
and let h be integrable. Then x⋆h is deﬁned for every t ∈R; it is an energy-limited
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz; and it can be represented as

x ⋆h

(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ˆh(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(6.65)
Proof. Since x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, it follows
from Proposition 6.4.5 that
x(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R,
(6.66)
with the mapping f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W} being square integrable and hence, by
Proposition 3.4.3, also integrable. Thus the convolution x ⋆h is the convolution
between the IFT of the integrable mapping f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W} and the integrable
function h. By Proposition 6.2.5 we thus obtain that the convolution x⋆h is deﬁned
11Again, we omit the proof that the inﬁmum is a minimum.

from (6.65) and Proposition 6.4.5 once we demonstrate that
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ˆh(f)
2 df < ∞.
This can be proved by upper-bounding |ˆh(f)| by ∥h∥1 (Theorem 6.2.11) and by
then using Parseval’s Theorem.
We next turn to integrable signals passed through stable ﬁlters.
Proposition 6.5.2 (Integrable Bandlimited Signals through Stable Filters). Let x
be an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, and let h be integrable. Then
the convolution x ⋆h is deﬁned for every t ∈R; it is an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W Hz; and it can be represented as

x ⋆h

(t) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ˆh(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(6.67)
Proof. Since every integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz is also an energy-
limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, it follows from Proposition 6.5.1 that the
convolution x⋆h is deﬁned at every epoch and that it can be represented as (6.65).
Alternatively, one can derive this representation from (6.61) and Proposition 6.2.5
by substituting in that proposition h for x and f 	→ˆx(f) I{|f| ≤W} (which is
integrable because ˆx is bounded by Theorem 6.2.11 (i)) for g. It only remains
to show that x ⋆h is integrable, but this follows because the convolution of two
integrable functions is integrable (5.9).
6.6
The Bandwidth of a Product of Two Signals
In this section we discuss the bandwidth of the product of two bandlimited signals.
The result is a straightforward consequence of the fact that the FT of a product
of two signals is the convolution of their FTs. We begin with the following result
on the FT of a product of signals.
Proposition 6.6.1 (The FT of a Product Is the Convolution of the FTs). If x1
and x2 are energy-limited signals, then their product
t 	→x1(t) x2(t)
is an integrable function whose FT is the mapping
f 	→
ˆx1 ⋆ˆx2

(f).
Proof. Let x1 and x2 be energy-limited signals, and denote their product by y:
y(t) = x1(t) x2(t),
t ∈R.

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
Since both x1 and x2 are square integrable, it follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality that their product y is integrable and that
∥y∥1 ≤∥x1∥2 ∥x2∥2 .
(6.68)
Having established that the product is integrable, we next derive its FT and show
that
ˆy(f) =
ˆx1 ⋆ˆx2

f ∈R.

This is done by expressing ˆy(f) as an inner product between two ﬁnite-energy
functions and by then using Parseval’s Theorem:

Proposition 6.6.2. Let x1 and x2 be energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to
W1 Hz and W2 Hz respectively. Then their product is an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W1 + W2 Hz.
Proof. Since both x1 and x2 are of ﬁnite energy, it follows from the Cauchy-
Schwarz Inequality that their product is integrable. We will show that their product
is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W1+W2 Hz using Theorem 6.4.10 (d)
by showing that
x1(t) x2(t) =

limited to W1 Hz we have by Proposition 6.4.5
x1(t) =

ducing the variables f ≜f1 + f2 and ˜f ≜f1.
To establish (6.70) we now need to show that because x1 and x2 are bandlimited
to W1 and W2 Hz respectively, it follows that
g(f) = 0,
|f| > W1 + W2.

Having established (6.70) using (6.72) and (6.74), we now proceed to prove (6.71)
by showing that the integrand in (6.71) is bounded.
We do so by noting that
the integrand in (6.71) is the convolution of two square-integrable functions (ˆx1
and ˆx2) so by (5.6b) (with the dummy variable now being f) we have
|g(f)| ≤∥ˆx1∥2 ∥ˆx2∥2 = ∥x1∥2 ∥x2∥2 < ∞,
f ∈R.

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
6.7
Bernstein’s Inequality
Bernstein’s Inequality captures the engineering intuition that the rate at which
a bandlimited signal can change is proportional to its bandwidth. The way the
theorem is phrased makes it clear that it is applicable both to integrable signals
that are bandlimited to W Hz and to energy-limited signals that are bandlimited
to W Hz.
Theorem 6.7.1 (Bernstein’s Inequality). If x can be written as
x(t) =
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R
for some integrable function g, then

dx(t)

 ≤4πW sup

t ∈R.
(6.76)
Proof. A proof of a slightly more general version of this theorem can be found in
(Pinsky, 2002, Chapter 2, Section 2.3.8).
6.8
Time-Limited and Bandlimited Signals
In this section we prove that no nonzero signal can be both time-limited and
bandlimited. We shall present two proofs. The ﬁrst is based on Theorem 6.8.1,
which establishes a connection between bandlimited signals and entire functions.
The second is based on the Fourier Series.
We remind the reader that a function ξ: C →C is an entire function if it is
analytic throughout the complex plane.
Theorem 6.8.1. If x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then
there exists an entire function ξ: C →C that agrees with x on the real axis
ξ(t + i0) = x(t),
t ∈R
(6.77)
and that satisﬁes
|ξ(z)| ≤γ e2πW|z|,
z ∈C,
(6.78)
where γ is some constant that can be taken as
√
2W ∥x∥2.
Proof. Let x be an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz. By Propo-
sition 6.4.5 we can express x as
x(t) =
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R
(6.79)
for some square-integrable function g satisfying

Consider now the function ξ: C →C deﬁned by
ξ(z) =
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πfz df,
z ∈C.
(6.81)
This function is well-deﬁned for every z ∈C because in the region of integration
the integrand can be bounded by
g(f) ei2πfz = |g(f)| e−2πf Im(z)
≤|g(f)| e2π|f| |Im(z)|
≤|g(f)| e2π W |z|,
|f| ≤W,
(6.82)
and the RHS of (6.82) is integrable over the interval [−W, W ] by (6.80) and Propo-
sition 3.4.3.
By (6.79) and (6.81) it follows that ξ is an extension of the function x in the sense
of (6.77). It is but a technical matter to prove that ξ is analytic. One approach is
to prove that it is diﬀerentiable at every z ∈C by verifying that the swapping of
diﬀerentiation and integration, which leads to
dξ
dz (z) =
 W
−W
g(f) (i2πf) ei2πfz df,
z ∈C
is justiﬁed. See (Rudin, 1987, Section 19.1) for a diﬀerent approach.
To prove (6.78) we compute
|ξ(z)| =

where the inequality in the second line follows from Proposition 2.4.1; the inequality
in the third line from (6.82); the inequality in the fourth line from Proposition 3.4.3;
and the ﬁnal equality from (6.80).
Using Theorem 6.8.1 we can now easily prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 6.8.2. Let W and T be ﬁxed nonnegative real numbers. If x is an energy-
limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz and that is time-limited in the sense that
it is zero for all t /∈[−T/2, T/2], then x(t) = 0 for all t ∈R.
By Note 6.4.12 this theorem also holds for integrable bandlimited signals.

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
Proof. By Theorem 6.8.1 x can be extended to an entire function ξ. Since x has
inﬁnitely many zeros in a bounded interval (e.g., for all t ∈[T, 2T ]) and since ξ
agrees with x on the real line, it follows that ξ also has inﬁnitely many zeros
in a bounded set (e.g., whenever z ∈{w ∈C : Im(w) = 0, Re(w) ∈[T, 2T] }).
Consequently, ξ is an entire function that has inﬁnitely many zeros in a bounded
subset of the complex plane and is thus the all-zero function (Rudin, 1987, Theo-
rem 10.18). But since x and ξ agree on the real line, it follows that x is also the
all-zero function.
Another proof can be based on the Fourier Series, which is discussed in the ap-
pendix. Starting from (6.79) we obtain that the time-η/(2W) sample of x(·) satisﬁes
1

g(f)

where we recognize the RHS of the above as the η-th Fourier Series Coeﬃcient of
the function f 	→g(f) I{|f| ≤W} with respect to the interval [−W, W) (Note A.3.5
on Page 837). But since x(t) = 0 whenever |t| > T/2, it follows that all but a ﬁnite
number of these samples can be nonzero, thus leading us to conclude that all but a
ﬁnite number of the Fourier Series Coeﬃcients of g(·) are zero. By the uniqueness
theorem for the Fourier Series (Theorem A.2.3) it follows that g(·) is equal to a
trigonometric polynomial (except possibly on a set of measure zero). Thus,
g(f) =

η=−n
aη ei2πηf/(2W),
f ∈[−W, W ] \ N,
(6.83)
for some n ∈N; for some 2n + 1 complex numbers a−n, . . . , an; and for some set
N ⊂[−W, W ] of Lebesgue measure zero. Since the integral in (6.79) is insensitive
to the behavior of g on the set N, it follows from (6.79) and (6.83) that
x(t) =

i.e., that x is a linear combination of a ﬁnite number of time-shifted sinc(·) func-
tions. It now remains to show that no linear combination of a ﬁnite number of
time-shifted sinc(·) functions can be zero for all t ∈[T, 2T ] unless it is zero for
all t ∈R. This can be established by extending the sincs to entire functions so
that the linear combination of the time-shifted sinc(·) functions is also an entire
function and by then calling again on the theorem that an entire function that has
inﬁnitely many zeros in a bounded subset of the complex plane must be the all-zero
function.

6.9
A Theorem by Paley and Wiener
The theorem of Paley and Wiener that we discuss next is important in the study
of bandlimited functions, but it will not be used in this book.
Theorem 6.8.1 showed that every energy-limited signal x that is bandlimited to W
Hz can be extended to an entire function ξ satisfying (6.78) for some constant γ
by deﬁning ξ(z) as
ξ(z) =
 W
−W
ˆx(f) ei2πfz df,
z ∈C.
(6.84)
The theorem of Paley and Wiener that we present next can be viewed as the
reverse statement. It demonstrates that if ξ: C →C is an entire function that
satisﬁes (6.78) and whose restriction to the real axis is square integrable, then its
restriction to the real axis is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz
and, moreover, if we denote this restriction by x so x(t) = ξ(t + i0) for all t ∈R,
then ξ is given by (6.84). This theorem demonstrates the close connection between
entire functions satisfying (6.78)—functions that are called entire functions of
exponential type—and energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to W Hz.
Theorem 6.9.1 (Paley-Wiener). If for some positive constants W and γ the entire
function ξ: C →C satisﬁes
|ξ(z)| ≤γ e2πW|z|,
z ∈C
(6.85)
and if
 ∞

|ξ(t + i0)|2 dt < ∞,

then there exists an energy-limited function g: R →C such that
ξ(z) =

z ∈C.

Proof. See for example, (Rudin, 1987, Theorem 19.3) or (Katznelson, 2004, Sec-
tion VI.7) or (Dym and McKean, 1972, Section 3.3).

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
where δ(·) denotes Dirac’s Delta. Needless to say, we are being extremely informal
because we said nothing about convergence. This result is sometimes called the
picket-fence miracle, because if we envision the plot of Dirac’s Delta as an
upward pointing bold arrow stemming from the origin, then the plot of a sum of
shifted Delta’s resembles a picket fence. The picket-fence miracle is that the FT
of a picket fence is yet another scaled picket fence; see (Oppenheim and Willsky,
1997, Chapter 4, Example 4.8 and also Chapter 7, Section 7.1.1.) or (Kwakernaak
and Sivan, 1991, Chapter 7, Example 7.4.19(c)).
In the mathematical literature, this result is called “the Poisson summation for-
mula.” It states that under certain conditions on the function ψ ∈L1,

and note that this function is periodic in the sense that φ(t + Ts) = φ(t) for every

[−Ts/2, Ts/2] (Note A.3.5 in the appendix). Its η-th Fourier Series Coeﬃcient with

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of φ(·) (6.89); the second by
swapping the summation and the integration and by deﬁning τ ≜t+jTs; the third
by the periodicity of the complex exponential; the fourth because summing the
integrals over disjoint intervals whose union is R is just the integral over R; and
the ﬁnal equality from the deﬁnition of the FT.
We can thus interpret the RHS of (6.88) as the evaluation13 at t = 0 of the Fourier
Series of φ(·) and the LHS as the evaluation of φ(·) at t = 0. Having established
13At t = 0 the complex exponentials are all equal to one, and the Fourier Series is thus just
the sum of the Fourier Series Coeﬃcients.

the origin of the Poisson summation formula, we can now readily state conditions
that guarantee that it holds. An example of a set of conditions that guarantees
(6.88) is the following:
1) The function ψ(·) is integrable.
2) The RHS of (6.89) converges at t = 0.
3) The Fourier Series of φ(·) converges at t = 0 to the value of φ(·) at t = 0.
We draw the reader’s attention to the fact that it is not enough that both sides of
(6.88) converge absolutely and that both ψ(·) and ˆψ(·) be continuous; see (Katznel-
son, 2004, Chapter VI, Section 1, Exercise 15).
A setting where the above conditions are satisﬁed and where (6.88) thus holds is
given in the following proposition.
Proposition 6.10.1. Let ψ(·) be a continuous function satisfying
ψ(t) =

(6.90c)
Proof. The integrability of ψ(·) follows because ψ(·) is continuous and zero outside
a ﬁnite interval. That the RHS of (6.89) converges at t = 0 follows because the
fact that ψ(·) is zero outside the interval [−T, +T ] implies that only a ﬁnite number
of terms contribute to the sum at t = 0. That the Fourier Series of φ(·) converges
at t = 0 to the value of φ(·) at t = 0 follows from (Katznelson, 2004, Chapter I,
Section 6.2, Equation (6.2)) and from the corollary in (Katznelson, 2004, Chapter I,
Section 3.1).

The Frequency Response of Filters and Bandlimited Signals
Engineers often speak of the 2WT degrees of freedom that signals that are band-
limited and time-limited have. A good starting point for the literature on this is
(Slepian, 1976).
Bandlimited functions are intimately related to “entire functions of exponential
type.” For an accessible introduction to this concept see (Requicha, 1980); for a
more mathematical approach see (Boas, 1954).

Chapter 7
Passband Signals and Their Representation
7.1
Introduction
The signals encountered in wireless communications are typically real passband
signals. In this chapter we shall deﬁne such signals and deﬁne their bandwidth
around a carrier frequency. We shall then explain how such signals can be rep-
resented using their complex baseband representation. We shall emphasize two
relationships: that between the energy in the passband signal and in its baseband
representation, and that between the bandwidth of the passband signal around the
carrier frequency and the bandwidth of its baseband representation. We ask the
reader to pay special attention to the fact that only real passband signals have a
baseband representation.
Most of the chapter deals with the family of integrable passband signals. As we
shall see in Corollary 7.2.4, an integrable passband signal must have ﬁnite energy,
and this family is thus a subset of the family of energy-limited passband signals.
Restricting ourselves to integrable signals—while reducing the generality of some of
the results—simpliﬁes the exposition because we can discuss the Fourier Transform
without having to resort to the L2-Fourier Transform, which requires all statements
to be phrased in terms of equivalence classes. But most of the derived results will
also hold for the more general family of energy-limited passband signals with only
slight modiﬁcations. The required modiﬁcations are discussed in Section 7.7.
7.2
Baseband and Passband Signals
Integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz were deﬁned in Deﬁnition 6.4.9. By
Proposition 6.4.10, an integrable signal x is bandlimited to W Hz if it is continuous
and if its FT is zero for all frequencies outside the band [−W, W ]. The bandwidth
of x is the smallest W to which it is bandlimited (Deﬁnition 6.4.13). As an example,
Figure 7.1 depicts the FT ˆx of a real signal x, which is bandlimited to W Hz.
Since the signal x in this example is real, its FT is conjugate-symmetric, (i.e.,
ˆx(−f) = ˆx∗(f) for all frequencies f ∈R). Thus, the magnitude of ˆx is symmetric
(even), i.e., |ˆx(f)| = |ˆx(−f)|, but its phase is anti-symmetric (odd). In the ﬁgure
dashed lines indicate this conjugate symmetry.
Consider now the real signal y whose FT ˆy is depicted in Figure 7.2. Again, since

the signal is real, its FT is conjugate-symmetric, and hence the dashed lines. This
signal (if continuous) is bandlimited to fc +W/2 Hz. But note that ˆy(f) = 0 for all
frequencies f in the interval |f| < fc−W/2. Signals such as y are often encountered
in wireless communications, because in a wireless channel the very-low frequencies
often suﬀer severe attenuation and are therefore seldom used.
Another reason
is the concurrent use of the wireless spectrum by many systems. If all systems
transmitted in the same frequency band, they would interfere with each other.
Consequently, diﬀerent systems are often assigned diﬀerent carrier frequencies so
that their transmitted signals will not overlap in frequency. This is why diﬀerent
radio stations transmit around diﬀerent carrier frequencies.
7.2.1
Deﬁnition and Characterization
To describe signals such as y we use the following deﬁnition for passband signals.
We ask the reader to recall the deﬁnition of the impulse response BPFW,fc(·) (see
(5.21)) and of the frequency response 
BPFW,fc(·) (see (6.41)) of the ideal unit-gain
bandpass ﬁlter of bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc.

Passband Signals and Their Representation
Deﬁnition 7.2.1 (A Passband Signal). A signal xPB is said to be an integrable
passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier fre-
quency fc if it is integrable
xPB ∈L1;
(7.1a)
the carrier frequency fc satisﬁes
fc > W

width W around the carrier frequency fc

(7.1c)
An energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc is analogously deﬁned but with (7.1a) replaced by the
condition
xPB ∈L2.
(7.1a’)
(That the convolution in (7.1c) is deﬁned at every t ∈R whenever xPB is integrable
can be shown using Proposition 6.2.5 because BPFW,fc is the Inverse Fourier Trans-
form of the integrable function f 	→I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

. That the convolution is
deﬁned at every t ∈R also when xPB is of ﬁnite energy can be shown by noting
that BPFW,fc is of ﬁnite energy, and the convolution of two ﬁnite-energy signals is
deﬁned at every time t ∈R; see Section 5.5.)
In analogy to Proposition 6.4.10 we have the following characterization:
Proposition 7.2.2 (Characterizing Integrable Passband Signals). Let fc and W
satisfy fc > W/2 > 0. If xPB is an integrable signal, then each of the following
statements is equivalent to the statement that xPB is an integrable passband signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc.
(a) The signal xPB is unaltered when it is bandpass ﬁltered:
xPB(t) =

xPB ⋆BPFW,fc

(t),
t ∈R.
(7.2)
(b) The signal xPB can be expressed as
xPB(t) =

||f|−fc|≤W/2
ˆxPB(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(7.3)
(c) The signal xPB is continuous and
ˆxPB(f) = 0,
|f| −fc
 > W

(7.4)
(d) There exists an integrable function g such that
xPB(t) =

||f|−fc|≤W/2
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.

Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 6.4.10 and is omitted.

7.2.2
Important Properties
By comparing (7.4) with (6.62) we obtain:
Corollary 7.2.3 (Integrable Passband Signals Are Bandlimited). If xPB is an
integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency
fc, then it is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to fc + W/2 Hz.
Using Corollary 7.2.3 and Note 6.4.12 we obtain:
Corollary 7.2.4 (Integrable Passband Signals Are of Finite Energy). Any inte-
grable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc
is of ﬁnite energy.
Proposition 7.2.5 (Integrable Passband Signals through Stable Filters). If xPB
is an integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc, and if h ∈L1 is the impulse response of a stable ﬁlter, then the
convolution xPB ⋆h is deﬁned at every epoch; it is an integrable passband signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc; and its FT is the
mapping f 	→ˆxPB(f) ˆh(f).
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of the analogous result for bandlimited
signals (Proposition 6.5.2) and is omitted.
7.3
Bandwidth around a Carrier Frequency
Deﬁnition 7.3.1 (The Bandwidth around a Carrier Frequency). The bandwidth
around the carrier fc of an integrable or energy-limited passband signal xPB is
the smallest W for which both (7.1b) and (7.1c) hold.
Note 7.3.2 (The Carrier Frequency Is Critical). The bandwidth of xPB around
the carrier frequency fc is determined not only by the FT of xPB but also by fc.
For example, the real passband signal whose FT is depicted in Figure 7.3 is of
bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc, but its bandwidth is smaller around
a slightly higher carrier frequency.
At ﬁrst it may seem that the deﬁnition of bandwidth for passband signals is incon-
sistent with the deﬁnition for baseband signals. This, however, is not the case. A
good way to remember the deﬁnitions is to focus on real signals. For such signals
the bandwidth for both baseband and passband signals is deﬁned as the length of
an interval of positive frequencies where the FT of the signal may be nonzero. For
baseband signals the bandwidth is the length of the smallest interval of positive
frequencies of the form [0, W] containing all positive frequencies where the FT may
be nonzero. For passband signals it is the length of the smallest interval of positive
frequencies that is symmetric around the carrier frequency fc and that contains
all positive frequencies where the signal may be nonzero. (For complex signals we
have to allow for the fact that the zeros of the FT may not be symmetric sets
around the origin.) See also Figures 6.2 and 6.3.

We draw the reader’s attention to an important consequence of our deﬁnition of
bandwidth:
Proposition 7.3.3 (Multiplication by a Carrier Doubles the Bandwidth). If x is
an integrable signal of bandwidth W Hz and if fc > W, then t 	→x(t) cos(2πfct) is
an integrable passband signal of bandwidth 2W around the carrier frequency fc.
Proof. Deﬁne y: t 	→x(t) cos(2πfct). The proposition is a straightforward conse-
quence of the deﬁnition of the bandwidth of x (Deﬁnition 6.4.13); the deﬁnition of
the bandwidth of y around the carrier frequency fc (Deﬁnition 7.3.1); and the fact
that if x is an integrable signal of FT ˆx, then y is an integrable signal of FT

As an illustration of the relation (7.6) note that if x is the complex bandwidth-W

the complex passband signal of bandwidth 2W around fc whose FT is depicted in
Figure 7.5.
Similarly, if x is the real baseband signal of bandwidth W whose FT is depicted
in Figure 7.6, then y: t 	→x(t) cos(2πfct) is the real passband signal of bandwidth
2W around fc whose FT is depicted in Figure 7.7.
In wireless applications the bandwidth W of the signals around the carrier frequency
is typically much smaller than the carrier frequency fc, but for most of our results

it suﬃces that (7.1b) hold.
The notion of a passband signal is also applied somewhat loosely in instances where
the signals are not bandlimited. Engineers say that an energy-limited signal is a
passband signal around the carrier frequency fc if most of its energy is contained
in frequencies that are close to fc and −fc. Notice that in this “deﬁnition” we are
relying heavily on Parseval’s theorem. I.e., we think about the energy ∥x∥2
2 of x as
being computed in the frequency domain, i.e., by computing ∥ˆx∥2
2 =

|ˆx(f)|2 df.
By “most of the energy is contained in frequencies that are close to fc and −fc”
we thus mean that most of the contributions to this integral come from small
frequency intervals around fc and −fc. In other words, we say that x is a passband
signal whose energy is mostly concentrated in a bandwidth W around the carrier
frequency fc if

Real Passband Signals
Before discussing the baseband representation of real passband signals we empha-
size the following.
(i) The passband signals transmitted and received in Digital Communications
are real.
(ii) Only real passband signals have a baseband representation.
(iii) The baseband representation of a real passband signal is typically a complex
signal.
(iv) While the FT of real signals is conjugate-symmetric (6.3), this does not imply
any symmetry with respect to the carrier frequency. Thus—although not
symmetric around fc—the FT depicted in Figure 7.2 is that of a real passband
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around fc.
We also note that if x is a real integrable signal, then its FT must be conjugate-
symmetric. But if g ∈L1 is such that its IFT ˇg is real, it does not follow that g
must be conjugate-symmetric.
For example, the conjugate symmetry could be
broken on a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero, a set that does not inﬂu-
ence the IFT. As the next proposition shows, this is the only way the conjugate
symmetry can be broken.
Proposition 7.4.1. If x is a real signal and if x = ˇg for some integrable function
g: f 	→g(f), then:
(i) The signal x can be represented as the IFT of a conjugate-symmetric inte-
grable function.
(ii) The function g and the conjugate-symmetric function f 	→

g(f)+g∗(−f)


agree except on a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero.
Proof. (i) Since x is real and since x = ˇg it follows that

because for any z ∈C we have Re(z) = (z + z∗)/2; the third by the hypothesis
that x = ˇg; the fourth because conjugating a complex integral is tantamount
to conjugating the integrand (Proposition 2.3.1 (ii)); the ﬁfth by changing the
integration variable in the second integral to ˜f ≜−f; and the sixth by combining
the integrals. Thus, x is the IFT of the conjugate-symmetric function deﬁned by

the IFT analog of Theorem 6.2.12 that the two agree outside a set of frequencies
of Lebesgue measure zero.
7.5
The Analytic Signal
In this section we shall deﬁne the analytic representation of a real passband
signal.
This is also sometimes called the analytic signal associated with the
signal. We shall use the two terms interchangeably. The analytic representation
will serve as a steppingstone to the baseband representation, which is extremely
important in Digital Communications. We emphasize that an analytic signal can
only be associated with a real passband signal. The analytic signal itself, however,
is complex-valued.
7.5.1
Deﬁnition and Characterization
Let xPB be a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc. We would have liked to deﬁne its analytic representation
as the complex signal xA whose FT is the mapping
f 	→ˆxPB(f) I{f ≥0},
(7.9)
i.e., as the integrable signal whose FT is equal to zero at negative frequencies and to
ˆxPB(f) at nonnegative frequencies. While this is often the way we think about xA,
there are two problems with this deﬁnition: an existence problem and a uniqueness
problem. It is not prima facie clear that there exists an integrable signal whose FT
is the mapping (7.9). (We shall soon see that there does.) And, since two signals
that diﬀer on a set of Lebesgue measure zero have identical Fourier Transforms, the
above deﬁnition would not fully specify xA. This could be remedied by insisting
that xA be continuous, but this would further exacerbate the existence issue. (We
shall see that there does exist a unique integrable continuous signal whose FT is
the mapping (7.9), but this requires proof.) Our approach is to deﬁne xA as the
IFT of the mapping (7.9) and to then explore the properties of xA.
Deﬁnition 7.5.1 (Analytic Representation of a Real Passband Signal). The an-
alytic representation of a real integrable passband signal xPB that is bandlimited
to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc is the complex signal xA deﬁned by
xA(t) ≜

7.5 The Analytic Signal
113
Note that, by Proposition 7.2.2, ˆxPB(f) vanishes at frequencies f that satisfy
|f| −fc
 > W/2, so we can also write (7.10) as
xA(t) =
 fc+ W
2
fc−W
2
ˆxPB(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(7.11)
This latter expression has the advantage that it makes it clear that the integral is
well-deﬁned for every t ∈R, because the integrability of xPB implies that the inte-
grand is bounded, i.e., that |ˆxPB(f)| ≤∥xPB∥1 for every f ∈R (Theorem 6.2.11)
and hence that the mapping f 	→ˆxPB(f) I{|f −fc| ≤W/2} is integrable.
Also note that our deﬁnition of the analytic signal may be oﬀby a factor of two
or
√
2 from the one used in some textbooks. (Some textbooks introduce a factor
of
√
2 in order to make the energy in the analytic signal equal that in the passband
signal. We do not do so and hence end up with a factor of two in (7.24) ahead.)
We next show that the analytic signal xA is a continuous and integrable signal and
that its FT is given by the mapping (7.9). In fact, we prove more.
Proposition 7.5.2 (Characterizations of the Analytic Signal). Let xPB be a real
integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier fre-
quency fc. Then each of the following statements is equivalent to the statement
that the complex-valued signal xA is its analytic representation.
(a) The signal xA is given by
xA(t) =

Passband Signals and Their Representation
Proof. That Condition (a) is equivalent to the statement that xA is the analytic
representation of xPB is just a restatement of Deﬁnition 7.5.1. It thus only remains
to show that Conditions (a), (b), (c), and (d) are equivalent. We shall do so by
establishing that (a) ⇔(d); that (b) ⇔(c); that (b) ⇒(a); and that (d) ⇒(c).
To establish (a) ⇔(d), let g: f 	→g(f) be any integrable function satisfying (7.14b)
and (7.14c). Since both xPB and g are integrable, we can compute xPB ⋆ˇg using
Proposition 6.2.5:

(7.15)
where the ﬁrst equality follows from Proposition 6.2.5; the second because the
assumption that xPB is a passband signal implies, by Proposition 7.2.2 (cf. (c)),
that the only negative frequencies f < 0 where ˆxPB(f) can be nonzero are those
satisfying | −f −fc| ≤W/2, and at those frequencies g is zero by (7.14c); the
third by Proposition 7.2.2 (cf. (c)); and the fourth equality by (7.14b). The LHS
of (7.15) is thus equal to xA(t) if, and only if, the RHS is equal to xA(t). This
establishes that (a) ⇔(d).
The equivalence (b) ⇔(c) is an immediate consequence of Proposition 7.2.2. That
(b) ⇒(a) can be proved using Corollary 6.2.14 as follows. If (b) holds, then xA
is a continuous integrable signal whose FT is given by the integrable function on
the RHS of (7.13) and therefore, by Corollary 6.2.14, xA is the IFT of the RHS of
(7.13), thus establishing (a).
We now complete the proof by showing that (d) ⇒(c). To this end let g: f 	→g(f)
be a continuous integrable function satisfying (7.14b) & (7.14c) and additionally
satisfying that its IFT ˇg is integrable. For example, g could be the function
g(f) =

If (d) holds, then
xA = xPB ⋆ˇg

so xA is the result of feeding an integrable passband signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc (the signal xPB) through a stable ﬁlter
(of impulse response h). Consequently, by Proposition 7.2.5, xA is an integrable
passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc and
its FT is given by f 	→ˆxPB(f) ˆh(f). Hence, as we next justify,
ˆxA(f) = ˆxPB(f) ˆh(f)
= ˆxPB(f) g(f)
= ˆxPB(f) g(f) I{f ≥0}
= ˆxPB(f) I{f ≥0},
f ∈R,
thus establishing (c). Here the third equality is justiﬁed by noting that the as-
sumption that xPB is a passband signal implies, by Proposition 7.2.2 (cf. (c)),
that the only negative frequencies f < 0 where ˆxPB(f) can be nonzero are those
satisfying |−f −fc| ≤W/2, and at those frequencies g is zero by (7.16), (7.17),
and (7.1b). The fourth equality follows by noting that the assumption that xPB
is a passband signal implies, by Proposition 7.2.2 (cf. (c)), that the only positive
frequencies f > 0 where ˆxPB(f) can be nonzero are those satisfying |f −fc| ≤W/2
and at those frequencies g(f) = 1 by (7.16).
7.5.2
From xA back to xPB
Proposition 7.5.2 describes the analytic representation xA in terms of the real
passband signal xPB. This representation would have been useless if we had not
been able to recover xPB from xA. Fortunately, we can. The key is that, because
xPB is real, its FT is conjugate-symmetric
ˆxPB(−f) = ˆx∗
PB(f),
f ∈R.

Passband Signals and Their Representation
Consequently, since the FT of xA is equal to that of xPB at the positive frequencies
and to zero at the negative frequencies (7.13), we can add to ˆxA its conjugated
mirror-image to obtain ˆxPB:
ˆxPB(f) = ˆxA(f) + ˆx∗

7.5 The Analytic Signal
117
7.5.3
Relating ⟨xPB, yPB⟩to ⟨xA, yA⟩
We next relate the inner product between two real passband signals to the inner
product between their analytic representations.
Proposition 7.5.4 (⟨xPB, yPB⟩and ⟨xA, yA⟩). Let xPB and yPB be real integrable
passband signals that are bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, and
let xA and yA be their analytic representations. Then
⟨xPB, yPB⟩= 2 Re

⟨xA, yA⟩

,
(7.23)
and
∥xPB∥2
2 = 2 ∥xA∥2
2 .
(7.24)
Note that in (7.23) the inner product appearing on the LHS is the inner product
between real signals whereas the one appearing on the RHS is between complex
signals.
Proof. We ﬁrst note that the inner products and energies are well-deﬁned because
integrable passband signals are also energy-limited (Corollary 7.2.4). Next, even
though (7.24) is a special case of (7.23), we ﬁrst prove (7.24). The proof is a simple
application of Parseval’s Theorem. The intuition is as follows. Since xPB is real,
it follows that its FT is conjugate-symmetric (7.19) so the magnitude of ˆxPB is
symmetric. Consequently, the positive frequencies and the negative frequencies
of ˆxPB contribute an equal share to the total energy in ˆxPB. And since the energy
in the analytic representation is equal to the share corresponding to the positive
frequencies only, its energy must be half the energy of xPB.
This can be argued more formally as follows. Because xPB is real-valued, its FT ˆxPB
is conjugate-symmetric (7.19), so its magnitude is symmetric |ˆxPB(f)| = |ˆxPB(−f)|
for all f ∈R and, a fortiori,
 ∞

|ˆxPB(f)|2 df =

Also, by Parseval’s Theorem (applied to xPB),

|ˆxPB(f)|2 df +
 0

|ˆxPB(f)|2 df = ∥xPB∥2

 ∞

|ˆxPB(f)|2 df = 1
2 ∥xPB∥2
2 .
(7.27)
We can now establish (7.24) from (7.27) by using Parseval’s Theorem (applied
to xA) and (7.13) to obtain

where the last equality follows from (7.27).
We next prove (7.23). We oﬀer two proofs. The ﬁrst is very similar to our proof
of (7.24): we use Parseval’s Theorem to express the inner products in the fre-
quency domain, and then argue that the contribution of the negative frequencies
to the inner product is the complex conjugate of the contribution of the positive
frequencies. The second proof uses a trick to relate inner products and energies.
We begin with the ﬁrst proof. Using Proposition 7.5.3 we have
ˆxPB(f) = ˆxA(f) + ˆx∗
A(−f),
f ∈R,
ˆyPB(f) = ˆyA(f) + ˆy∗

7.6
Baseband Representation of Real Passband Signals
Strictly speaking, the baseband representation xBB of a real passband sig-
nal xPB is not a “representation” because one cannot recover xPB from xBB alone;
one also needs to know the carrier frequency fc. This may seem like a disadvantage,
but engineers view this as an advantage. Indeed, in some cases, it may illuminate
the fact that certain operations and results do not depend on the carrier frequency.
This decoupling of various operations from the carrier frequency is very useful in
hardware implementation of communication systems that need to work around
selectable carrier frequencies. It allows for some of the processing to be done us-
ing carrier-independent hardware and for only a small part of the communication
system to be tunable to the carrier frequency. Very loosely speaking, engineers
think of xBB as everything about xPB that is not carrier-dependent. Thus, one
does not usually expect the quantity fc to show up in a formula for the baseband
representation. Philosophical thoughts aside, the baseband representation has a
straightforward deﬁnition.
7.6.1
Deﬁnition and Characterization
Deﬁnition 7.6.1 (Baseband Representation). The baseband representation of
a real integrable passband signal xPB that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc is the complex signal
xBB(t) ≜e−i2πfct xA(t),
t ∈R,
(7.29)
where xA is the analytic representation of xPB.
Note that, by (7.29), the magnitudes of xA and xBB are identical
xBB(t)
 =
xA(t)
,
t ∈R.

Passband Signals and Their Representation
Consequently, since xA is integrable we also have:
Proposition 7.6.2 (Integrability of xPB Implies Integrability of xBB). The base-
band representation of a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W
Hz around the carrier frequency fc is integrable.
By (7.29) and (7.13) we obtain that if xPB is a real integrable passband signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, then
ˆxBB(f) = ˆxA(f + fc) =

ˆxPB(f + fc)
if |f| ≤W/2,
0
otherwise.
(7.31)
Thus, the FT of xBB is the FT of xA but shifted to the left by the carrier fre-
quency fc. The relationship between the Fourier Transforms of xPB, xA, and xBB
is depicted in Figure 7.9.
We have deﬁned the baseband representation of a passband signal in terms of its
analytic representation, but sometimes it is useful to deﬁne the baseband represen-
tation directly in terms of the passband signal. This is not very diﬃcult. Rather
than taking the passband signal and passing it through a ﬁlter of frequency re-
sponse g satisfying (7.14) to obtain xA and then multiplying the result by e−i2πfct
to obtain xBB, we can multiply xPB by t 	→e−i2πfct and then ﬁlter the result to
obtain the baseband representation. This procedure is depicted in the frequency
domain in Figure 7.10 and is made precise in the following proposition.
Proposition 7.6.3 (From xPB to xBB Directly). If xPB is a real integrable passband
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, then its baseband
representation xBB is given by
xBB =

|f + 2fc| ≤W

(7.32c)
Proof. The proof is all in Figure 7.10. For an analytic proof we provide the fol-
lowing details. By Deﬁnition 7.6.1 and by Proposition 7.5.2 (cf. (d)) we have for
any integrable function g: f 	→g(f) satisfying (7.14b) & (7.14c)

the FT of t 	→e−i2πfct xPB(t) is f 	→ˆxPB(f + fc).

7.6 Baseband Representation of Real Passband Signals

Corollary 7.6.4. If xPB is a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W
Hz around the carrier frequency fc, then its baseband representation xBB is given
by
xBB =

t 	→e−i2πfct xPB(t)

⋆LPFWc,
(7.35a)
where the cutoﬀfrequency Wc can be chosen arbitrarily in the range
W
2 ≤Wc ≤2fc −W
2 .
(7.35b)
Proof. Let Wc satisfy (7.35b) and deﬁne g0 as follows: if Wc is strictly smaller
than 2fc−W/2, deﬁne g0(f) = I{|f| ≤Wc}; otherwise deﬁne g0(f) = I{|f| < Wc}.
In both cases g0 satisﬁes (7.32b) & (7.32c) and
ˇg0 = LPFWc .
(7.36)
The result now follows by applying Proposition 7.6.3 with this choice of g0.
In analogy to Proposition 7.5.2, we can characterize the baseband representation
of passband signals as follows.
Proposition 7.6.5 (Characterizing the Baseband Representation). Let xPB be
a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc. Then each of the following statements is equivalent to the statement
that the complex signal xBB is its baseband representation.
(a) The signal xBB is given by
xBB(t) =
 W/2
−W/2
ˆxPB(f + fc) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(7.37)
(b) The signal xBB is a continuous integrable signal satisfying
ˆxBB(f) = ˆxPB(f + fc) I
'
|f| ≤W
2
(
,
f ∈R.
(7.38)
(c) The signal xBB is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz and that
satisﬁes (7.38).
(d) The signal xBB is given by (7.32a) for any g0 : f 	→g0(f) satisfying (7.32b)
& (7.32c).
Proof. Parts (a), (b), and (c) can be easily deduced from their counterparts in
Proposition 7.5.2 using Deﬁnition 7.6.1 and the fact that (7.30) implies that the
integrability of xBB is equivalent to the integrability of xA. Part (d) is a restatement
of Proposition 7.6.3.

7.6.2
The In-Phase and Quadrature Components
The convolution in (7.35a) is a convolution between a complex signal (the signal
t 	→e−i2πfctxPB(t)) and a real signal (the signal LPFWc). This should not alarm
you. The convolution of two complex signals evaluated at time t is expressed as an
integral (5.2), and in the case of complex signals this is an integral (over the real
line) of a complex-valued integrand. Such integrals were addressed in Section 2.3.
It should, however, be noted that since the deﬁnition of the convolution of two sig-
nals involves their products, the real part of the convolution of two complex-valued
signals is, in general, not equal to the convolution of their real parts. However, as
we next show, if one of the signals is real—as is the case in (7.35a)—then things
become simpler: if x is a complex-valued function of time and if h is a real-valued
function of time, then
Re

x ⋆h

= Re(x) ⋆h and Im

x ⋆h

= Im(x) ⋆h,
h is real-valued.
(7.39)
This follows from the deﬁnition of the convolution,
(x ⋆h)(t) =
 ∞
−∞
x(τ) h(t −τ) dτ
and from the basic properties of complex integrals (Proposition 2.3.1) by noting
that if h(·) is real-valued, then for all t, τ ∈R,
Re

We next use (7.39) to express the convolution in (7.32a) using real-number oper-
ations. To that end we ﬁrst note that since xPB is real, it follows from Euler’s
Identity
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ,

Bandwidth Considerations
The following is a simple but exceedingly important observation regarding band-
width. Recall that the bandwidth of xPB around the carrier frequency fc is deﬁned
in Deﬁnition 7.3.1 and that the bandwidth of the baseband signal xBB is deﬁned
in Deﬁnition 6.4.13.
Proposition 7.6.7 (xPB, xBB, and Bandwidth). If the real integrable passband
signal xPB is of bandwidth W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, then its baseband
representation xBB is an integrable signal of bandwidth W/2 Hz.

Recovering xPB from xBB
Recovering a real passband signal xPB from its baseband representation xBB is
conceptually simple. We can recover the analytic representation via (7.29) and
then use Proposition 7.5.3 to recover xPB:
Proposition 7.6.8 (From xBB to xPB). Let xPB be a real integrable passband

its baseband representation. Then,
ˆxPB(f) = ˆxBB(f −fc) + ˆx∗

The process of recovering xPB from xBB is depicted in the frequency domain in

tation of xPB; it is possible that xPB(t) = 2 Re

z(t) ei2πfct
hold at every time t and
that z not be the baseband representation of xPB. However, as the next proposition
shows, this cannot happen if z is bandlimited to W/2 Hz.
Proposition 7.6.9. Let xPB be a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. If the complex signal z satisﬁes
xPB(t) = 2 Re

z(t) ei2πfct
,
t ∈R,
(7.45)
and is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, then z is the baseband
representation of xPB.
Proof. Since z is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, it follows from Proposition 6.4.10 (cf. (c))
that z must be continuous and that its FT must vanish for |f| > W/2. Conse-
quently, by Proposition 7.6.5 (cf. (b)), all that remains to show in order to establish
that z is the baseband representation of xPB is that
ˆz(f) = ˆxPB(f + fc),
|f| ≤W/2,
(7.46)
and this is what we proceed to do. By taking the FT of both sides of (7.45) we
obtain that
ˆxPB(f) = ˆz(f −fc) + ˆz∗(−f −fc),
f ∈R,
(7.47)
or, upon deﬁning ˜f ≜f −fc,
ˆxPB( ˜f + fc) = ˆz( ˜f) + ˆz∗(−˜f −2fc),
˜f ∈R.

Passband Signals and Their Representation
By recalling that fc > W/2 and that ˆz is zero for frequencies f satisfying |f| > W/2,
we obtain that ˆz∗(−˜f −2fc) is zero whenever | ˜f| ≤W/2 so
ˆz( ˜f) + ˆz∗(−˜f −2fc) = ˆz( ˜f),
| ˜f| ≤W/2.
(7.49)
Combining (7.48) and (7.49) we obtain
ˆxPB( ˜f + fc) = ˆz( ˜f),
| ˜f| ≤W/2,
thus establishing (7.46) and hence completing the proof.
Proposition 7.6.9 is more useful than its appearance may suggest. It provides an
alternative way of computing the baseband representation of a signal. It demon-
strates that if we can use algebra to express xPB in the form (7.45) for some signal z,
and if we can verify that z is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, then z must be the baseband
representation of xPB.
Note that the proof would also work if we replaced the assumption that z is an
integrable signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz with the assumption that z is an
integrable signal that is bandlimited to fc Hz.
7.6.5
Relating ⟨xPB, yPB⟩to ⟨xBB, yBB⟩
If xPB and yPB are integrable real passband signals that are bandlimited to W Hz
around the carrier frequency fc, and if xA, xBB , yA, and yBB are their corre-
sponding analytic and baseband representations, then, by (7.29),
⟨xBB, yBB⟩= ⟨xA, yA⟩,
(7.50)
because
⟨xBB, yBB⟩=

tween the inner product between two real passband signals and the inner product
between their corresponding complex baseband representations.
Theorem 7.6.10 (⟨xPB, yPB⟩and ⟨xBB, yBB⟩). Let xPB and yPB be real integrable
passband signals that are bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, and
let xBB and yBB be their corresponding baseband representations. Then

(7.52)
An extremely important corollary provides a necessary and suﬃcient condition for
the inner product between two real passband signals to be zero, i.e., for two real
passband signals to be orthogonal.
Corollary 7.6.11 (Characterizing Orthogonal Real Passband Signals). Two in-
tegrable real passband signals xPB, yPB that are bandlimited to W Hz around the
carrier frequency fc are orthogonal if, and only if, the inner product between their
baseband representations is purely imaginary (i.e., of zero real part).
Thus, for two such passband signals to be orthogonal their baseband representa-
tions need not be orthogonal: it suﬃces that their inner product be purely imagi-
nary.
7.6.6
The Baseband Representation of xPB ⋆yPB
Proposition 7.6.12 (The Baseband Representation of xPB ⋆yPB Is xBB ⋆yBB).
Let xPB and yPB be real integrable passband signals that are bandlimited to W Hz
around the carrier frequency fc, and let xBB and yBB be their baseband repre-
sentations. Then the convolution xPB ⋆yPB is a real integrable passband signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc and whose baseband
representation is xBB ⋆yBB.
Proof. The proof is illustrated in Figure 7.13 on Page 130. All that remains is to
add some technical details. We begin by deﬁning
z = xPB ⋆yPB
and by noting that, by Proposition 7.2.5, z is an integrable real passband signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc and that its FT is
given by
ˆz(f) = ˆxPB(f) ˆyPB(f),
f ∈R.
(7.53)
Thus, it is at least meaningful to discuss the baseband representation of xPB ⋆yPB.
We next note that, by Proposition 7.6.5, both xBB and yBB are integrable signals
that are bandlimited to W/2 Hz. Consequently, by Proposition 6.5.2, the convolu-
tion u = xBB ⋆yBB is deﬁned at every epoch t and is also an integrable signal that
is bandlimited to W/2 Hz. Its FT is
ˆu(f) = ˆxBB(f) ˆyBB(f),
f ∈R.
(7.54)
From Proposition 7.6.5 we infer that to prove that u is the baseband representation
of z it only remains to verify that ˆu is the mapping f 	→ˆz(f + fc) I{|f| ≤W/2},
which, in view of (7.53) and (7.54), is equivalent to showing that
ˆxBB(f) ˆyBB(f) = ˆxPB(f + fc) ˆyPB(f + fc) I{|f| ≤W/2},
f ∈R.

But this follows because the fact that xBB and yBB are the baseband representa-
tions of xPB and yPB implies that
ˆxBB(f) = ˆxPB(f + fc) I{|f| ≤W/2},
f ∈R,
ˆyBB(f) = ˆyPB(f + fc) I{|f| ≤W/2},
f ∈R,
from which (7.55) follows.
7.6.7
The Baseband Representation of xPB ⋆h
We next study the result of passing a real integrable passband signal xPB that is
bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc through a real stable ﬁlter
of impulse response h. Our focus is on the baseband representation of the result.
Proposition 7.6.13 (Baseband Representation of xPB⋆h). Let xPB be a real inte-
grable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc,
and let xBB be its baseband representation. Let h ∈L1 be real. Then xPB ⋆h is
deﬁned at every time instant; it is a real integrable passband signal that is band-
limited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc; and its baseband representation
is of FT
f 	→ˆxBB(f) ˆh(f + fc),
f ∈R
(7.56)
and is given by

xPB ⋆h

BB(t) =
 ∞
−∞
ˆxBB(f) ˆh(f + fc) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(7.57)
Proof. That the convolution xPB ⋆h is deﬁned at every time instant follows from
Proposition 7.2.5. Denote xPB ⋆h by y. By the same proposition, y is a real inte-
grable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc,
and its FT is given by
ˆy(f) = ˆxPB(f) ˆh(f),
f ∈R.
(7.58)
From (7.58) (and Proposition 7.6.5 (cf. (b)) applied to the signal y), we obtain
that the baseband representation of y is of FT
f 	→ˆxPB(f + fc) ˆh(f + fc) I
'
|f| ≤W

(
,
f ∈R.
(7.59)
To establish that the mapping in (7.56) is indeed the FT of (xPB ⋆h)BB it thus
remains to establish that the mappings (7.59) and (7.56) are identical. But this
follows because, by Proposition 7.6.5 (cf. (b)) applied to the signal xPB,
ˆxBB(f) = ˆxPB(f + fc) I
'
|f| ≤W

(

f ∈R.
To justify the inversion formula (7.57), recall that (xPB⋆h)BB—being the baseband
representation of an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around fc—is an
integrable signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz (Proposition 7.6.5 (cf. (c)) applied
to xPB ⋆h), so the inversion is justiﬁed by Proposition 6.4.10 (cf. (b)).

Figure 7.14 illustrates the relationship between the frequency response of a real
ﬁlter and its response with respect to the carrier frequency fc and bandwidth W.
Heuristically, we can think of the frequency response with respect to the band-
width W around the carrier frequency fc of a ﬁlter of real impulse response h as
the FT of the baseband representation of h ⋆BPFW,fc.2
With the aid of Deﬁnition 7.6.14 we can restate Proposition 7.6.13 as stating that
the baseband representation of the result of passing a real integrable passband
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc through a
stable real ﬁlter is the product of the FT of the baseband representation of the
signal by the frequency response with respect to the bandwidth W around the
carrier frequency fc of the ﬁlter. This relationship is illustrated in Figures 7.15
2This is mathematically somewhat problematic because h⋆BPFW,fc need not be an integrable
signal.
But this can be remedied because h ⋆BPFW,fc is an energy-limited passband signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency, and, as such, also has a baseband
representation; see Section 7.7.

7.7.1
Characterization of Energy-Limited Passband Signals
Recall that energy-limited passband signals were deﬁned in Deﬁnition 7.2.1 as
energy-limited signals that are unaltered by bandpass ﬁltering.
In this subsec-
tion we shall describe alternative characterizations. Aiding us in the character-
ization is the following lemma, which can be viewed as the passband analog of
Lemma 6.4.4 (i).
Lemma 7.7.1. Let x be an energy-limited signal, and let fc > W/2 > 0 be given.
Then the signal x ⋆BPFW,fc can be expressed as

x ⋆BPFW,fc

(t) =

||f|−fc|≤W/2
ˆx(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R;
(7.61)
it is of ﬁnite energy; and its L2-Fourier Transform is (the equivalence class of) the
mapping f 	→ˆx(f) I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

.
Proof. The lemma follows from Lemma 6.4.4 (ii) by substituting for g the mapping
f 	→I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

, whose IFT is BPFW,fc.
In analogy to Proposition 6.4.5 we can characterize energy-limited passband signals
as follows.
Proposition 7.7.2 (Characterizations of Passband Signals in L2).
(i) If x is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc, then it can be expressed in the form
x(t) =

||f|−fc|≤W/2
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R,
(7.62)
for some mapping g: f 	→g(f) satisfying

||f|−fc|≤W/2
|g(f)|2 df < ∞
(7.63)
that can be taken as (any function in the equivalence class of) ˆx.
(ii) If a signal x can be expressed as in (7.62) for some function g satisfying
(7.63) with fc > W/2 > 0, then x is an energy-limited passband signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc and its FT ˆx is (the
equivalence class of) the mapping f 	→g(f) I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

.
Proof. The proof of Part (i) follows from Deﬁnition 7.2.1 and from Lemma 7.7.1 in
very much the same way as Part (i) of Proposition 6.4.5 follows from Deﬁnition 6.4.1
and Lemma 6.4.4 (i).
The proof of Part (ii) is analogous to the proof of Part (ii) of Proposition 6.4.5.
As a corollary we obtain the analog of Corollary 7.2.3:

Passband Signals and Their Representation
Corollary 7.7.3 (Energy-Limited Passband Signals Are Bandlimited). If xPB is
an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc, then it is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to fc +W/2 Hz.
Proof. If xPB is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz
around the carrier frequency fc, then, by Proposition 7.7.2 (i), there exists a func-
tion g: f 	→g(f) satisfying (7.63) such that xPB is given by (7.62). But this implies
that the function f 	→g(f) I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

is an energy-limited function such
that
xPB(t) =
 fc+W/2
−fc−W/2
g(f) I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

ei2πft df,
t ∈R,
(7.64)
so, by Proposition 6.4.5 (ii), xPB is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to
fc + W/2 Hz.
The following is the analog of Proposition 6.4.6.
Proposition 7.7.4.
(i) If xPB is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz
around the carrier frequency fc, then xPB is a continuous function and all
its energy is contained in the frequencies f satisfying
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2 in the
sense that
 ∞
−∞
|ˆxPB(f)|2 df =

||f|−fc|≤W/2
|ˆxPB(f)|2 df.
(7.65)
(ii) If xPB ∈L2 satisﬁes (7.65), then xPB is indistinguishable from the signal
xPB⋆BPFW,fc, which is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz around fc.
If in addition to satisfying (7.65) the signal xPB is
continuous, then xPB is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc.
Proof. This proposition’s claims are a subset of those of Proposition 7.7.5, which
summarizes some of the results related to bandpass ﬁltering.
Proposition 7.7.5. Let y = x⋆BPFW,fc be the result of feeding the signal x ∈L2 to
an ideal unit-gain bandpass ﬁlter of bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc.
Assume fc > W/2. Then:
(i) y is energy-limited with
∥y∥2 ≤∥x∥2 .
(7.66)
(ii) y is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc.

Proof. The proof is very similar to the proof of Proposition 6.4.7 and is thus
omitted.
7.7.2
The Analytic Representation
If xPB is a real energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc, then we deﬁne its analytic representation via (7.11). (Since
xPB ∈L2, it follows from Parseval’s Theorem that ˆxPB is energy-limited so, by
Proposition 3.4.3, the mapping f 	→ˆxPB(f) I{|f −fc| ≤W/2} is integrable and
the integral (7.11) is deﬁned for every t ∈R. Also, the integral does not depend
on which element of the equivalence class consisting of the L2-Fourier Transform
of xPB it is applied to.)
In analogy to Proposition 7.5.2 we can characterize the analytic representation as
follows.
Proposition 7.7.6 (Characterizing the Analytic Representation of xPB ∈L2).
Let xPB be a real energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc. Then each of the following statements is equivalent to the
statement that the complex signal xA is the analytic representation of xPB:

(c) The signal xA is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W

and
g(f) = 0,
f + fc

(7.73b)
Proof. The proof is not very diﬃcult and is omitted.
We note that the reconstruction formula (7.22b) continues to hold also when xPB
is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier fre-
quency fc.
7.7.3
The Baseband Representation of xPB ∈L2
Having deﬁned the analytic representation, we now use (7.29) to deﬁne the base-
band representation.
As in Proposition 7.6.3, we can also describe a procedure for obtaining the base-
band representation of a passband signal without having to go via the analytic
representation.
Proposition 7.7.7 (From xPB ∈L2 to xBB Directly). If xPB is a real energy-
limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc,
then its baseband representation xBB is given by

Proposition 7.7.8 (Characterizing the Baseband Representation of xPB ∈L2).
Let xPB be a real energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc. Then each of the following statements is equivalent to the
statement that the complex signal xBB is the baseband representation of xPB.
(a) The signal xBB is given by
xBB(t) =

W
2
−W
2
ˆxPB(f + fc) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(7.76)
(b) The signal xBB is a continuous energy-limited signal whose L2-Fourier Trans-
form is (the equivalence class of) the mapping
f 	→ˆxPB(f + fc) I{|f| ≤W/2}.
(7.77)
(c) The signal xBB is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz
and whose L2-Fourier Transform is (the equivalence class of) the mapping
(7.77).
(d) The signal xBB is given by (7.74) for any mapping g0 : f 	→g0(f) satisfying
(7.75).
The in-phase component and the quadrature component of an energy-limited
passband signal are deﬁned, as in the integrable case, as the real and imaginary
parts of its baseband representation.
Proposition 7.6.7, which asserts that the bandwidth of xBB is half the bandwidth
of xPB continues to hold, as does the reconstruction formula (7.43b). Proposi-
tion 7.6.9 also extends to energy-limited signals. We repeat it (in a slightly more
general way) for future reference.
Proposition 7.7.9.
(i) If z is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, and if the
signal x is given by
x(t) = 2 Re

z(t) ei2πfct
,
t ∈R,
(7.78)
where fc > W/2, then x is a real energy-limited passband signal that is band-
limited to W Hz around fc, and z is its baseband representation.
(ii) If x is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc and if (7.78) holds for some energy-limited signal z
that is bandlimited to fc Hz, then z is the baseband representation of x and
is, in fact, bandlimited to W/2 Hz.

Passband Signals and Their Representation
Proof. Omitted.
Identity (7.51) relating the inner products ⟨xPB, yPB⟩and ⟨xBB, yBB⟩continues to
hold for energy-limited passband signals that are not necessarily integrable.
Proposition 7.6.12 does not hold for energy-limited signals, because the convolution
of two energy-limited signals need not be energy-limited. But if we assume that at
least one of the signals is also integrable, then things sail through. Consequently,
using Corollary 7.2.4 we obtain:
Proposition 7.7.10 (The Baseband Representation of xPB ⋆yPB Is xBB ⋆yBB).
Let xPB be a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc, and let yPB be a real energy-limited passband signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. Let xBB and yBB be their
corresponding baseband representations. Then xPB ⋆yPB is a real energy-limited
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc and whose
baseband representation is xBB ⋆yBB.
Proposition 7.6.13 too requires only a slight modiﬁcation to address energy-limited
signals.
Proposition 7.7.11 (Baseband Representation of xPB ⋆h). Let xPB be a real
energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier fre-
quency fc, and let h be a real integrable signal. Then xPB ⋆h is deﬁned at every
time instant; it is a real energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W
Hz around the carrier frequency fc; and its baseband representation is given by

h ⋆xPB

BB = h′
BB ⋆xBB,
(7.79)
where h′
BB is the baseband representation of the energy-limited signal h⋆BPFW,fc.
The L2-Fourier Transform of the baseband representation of xPB ⋆h is (the equiv-
alence class of) the mapping
f 	→ˆxBB(f) ˆh(f + fc),
f ∈R,
(7.80)
where xBB is the baseband representation of xPB.
The following theorem summarizes some of the properties of the baseband repre-
sentation of energy-limited passband signals.
Theorem 7.7.12 (Properties of the Baseband Representation).
(i) The mapping xPB 	→xBB that maps every real energy-limited passband signal
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc to its baseband
representation is a one-to-one mapping onto the space of complex energy-
limited signals that are bandlimited to W/2 Hz.
(ii) The mapping xPB 	→xBB is linear in the sense that if xPB and yPB are
real energy-limited passband signals that are bandlimited to W Hz around

band representations, then for every α, β ∈R, the baseband representation of

BB= αxBB + βyBB,
α, β ∈R.

(v) The (baseband) bandwidth of xBB is half the bandwidth of xPB around the
carrier frequency fc.
(vi) The baseband representation xBB can be expressed in terms of xPB as
xBB =

W/2 ≤Wc ≤2fc −W/2.

resentation xBB as
xPB(t) = 2 Re

(7.85)
(viii) If h is a real integrable signal, and if xPB is as above, then h ⋆xPB is a real
energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc, and its baseband representation is given by

h ⋆xPB

BB = h′
BB ⋆xBB,
(7.86)
where h′
BB is the baseband representation of the energy-limited real signal
h ⋆BPFW,fc.
7.8
Shifting to Passband and Convolving
The following result is almost trivial if you think about its interpretation in the
frequency domain. To that end, it is good to focus on the case where the signal x
is a bandlimited baseband signal and where fc is positive and large. In this case
we can interpret the LHS of (7.87) as the result of taking the baseband signal x,
up-converting it to passband by forming the signal τ 	→x(τ) ei2πfcτ, and then
convolving the result with h. The RHS corresponds to down-converting h to form
the signal τ 	→e−i2πfcτh(τ), then convolving this signal with x, and then up-
converting the ﬁnal result.

Mathematical Comments
The analytic representation is related to the Hilbert Transform; see, for example,
(Pinsky, 2002, Section 3.4). In our proof that xA is integrable whenever xPB is
integrable we implicitly exploited the fact that the strict inequality fc > W/2
implies that for the class of integrable passband signals that are bandlimited to W
Hz around the carrier frequency fc there exist Hilbert Transform kernels that are
integrable. See, for example, (Logan, 1978, Section 2.5).

Chapter 8
Complete Orthonormal Systems and the
Sampling Theorem
8.1
Introduction
Like Chapter 4, this chapter deals with the geometry of the space L2 of energy-
limited signals. Here, however, our focus is on inﬁnite-dimensional linear subspaces
of L2 and on the notion of a complete orthonormal system (CONS). As an
application of this geometric picture, we shall present the Sampling Theorem as
an orthonormal expansion with respect to a CONS for the space of energy-limited
signals that are bandlimited to W Hz.
8.2
Complete Orthonormal System
Recall that L2 is the space of all Lebesgue measurable signals u: R →C satisfying
 ∞
−∞
|u(t)|2 dt < ∞.
Also recall from Section 4.3 that a subset U of L2 is said to be a linear subspace of
L2 if U is nonempty and if the signal αu1 + βu2 is in U whenever u1, u2 ∈U and
α, β ∈C. A linear subspace is said to be ﬁnite-dimensional if there exists a ﬁnite
number of signals that span it; otherwise, it is said to be inﬁnite-dimensional. The
following are some examples of inﬁnite-dimensional linear subspaces of L2.
(i) The set of all functions of the form t 	→p(t) e−|t|, where p(t) is any polynomial
(of arbitrary degree).
(ii) The set of all energy-limited signals that vanish outside the interval [−1, 1]
(i.e., that map every t outside this interval to zero).
(iii) The set of all energy-limited signals that vanish outside some unspeciﬁed
ﬁnite interval (i.e., the set containing all signals u for which there exist some
a, b ∈R (depending on u) such that u(t) = 0 whenever t /∈[a, b]).
(iv) The set of all energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to W Hz.

Complete Orthonormal Systems and the Sampling Theorem
While a basis for an inﬁnite-dimensional subspace can be deﬁned,1 this notion does
not turn out to be very useful for our purposes. Much more useful to us is the
notion of a complete orthonormal system, which we shall deﬁne shortly.2
To motivate the deﬁnition, consider a bi-inﬁnite sequence . . . , φ−1, φ0, φ1, φ2, . . .
in L2 satisfying the orthonormality condition
⟨φℓ, φℓ′⟩= I{ℓ= ℓ′},
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z,
(8.1)
and let u be an arbitrary element of L2. Deﬁne the signals
uL ≜
L

ℓ=−L
⟨u, φℓ⟩φℓ,
L = 1, 2, . . .
(8.2)
By Note 4.6.7, uL is the projection of the vector u onto the subspace spanned
by (φ−L, . . . , φL).
By the orthonormality (8.1), the tuple (φ−L, . . . , φL) is an
orthonormal basis for this subspace. Consequently, by Proposition 4.6.9,
∥u∥2
2 ≥
L

ℓ=−L
⟨u, φℓ⟩
2,
L = 1, 2, . . . ,
(8.3)
with equality if, and only if, u is indistinguishable from some linear combination
of

φ−L, . . . , φL

. This motivates us to explore the situation where (8.3) holds
with equality when L →∞and to hope that it corresponds to u being—in some
sense that needs to be made precise—indistinguishable from a limit of ﬁnite linear
combinations of . . . , φ−1, φ0, φ1, . . .
Deﬁnition 8.2.1 (Complete Orthonormal System). A bi-inﬁnite sequence of sig-
nals . . . , φ−1, φ0, φ1, . . . is said to form a complete orthonormal system or a
CONS for the linear subspace U of L2 if all three of the following conditions hold:
1) Each element of the sequence is in U
φℓ∈U,
ℓ∈Z.
(8.4)
2) The sequence satisﬁes the orthonormality condition
⟨φℓ, φℓ′⟩= I{ℓ= ℓ′},
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z.
(8.5)
3) For every u ∈U we have
∥u∥2
2 =
∞

ℓ=−∞
⟨u, φℓ⟩
2,
u ∈U.
(8.6)
1A (Hamel) basis for a subspace U is a subset of U such that any function in U is equal to a
linear combination of a ﬁnite number of elements of the subset, and such that any ﬁnite number
of elements of the subset are linearly independent. More useful to us is the notion of a complete
orthonormal system. From a complete orthonormal system we require that each function in U be
approximately equal to a linear combination of a ﬁnite number of functions in the system.
2Mathematicians usually deﬁne a CONS only for closed subspaces.
Such subspaces are
discussed in Section 8.6.

8.2 Complete Orthonormal System
149
The following proposition considers equivalent deﬁnitions of a CONS and demon-
strates that if {φℓ} is a CONS for U, then, indeed, every element of U can be
approximated by a ﬁnite linear combination of the functions {φℓ}.
Proposition 8.2.2. Let U be a subspace of L2 and let the bi-inﬁnite sequence
. . . , φ−2, φ−1, φ0, φ1, . . . satisfy (8.4) & (8.5).
Then each of the following con-
ditions on {φℓ} is equivalent to the condition that {φℓ} forms a CONS for U:
(a) For every u ∈U and every ϵ > 0 there exists some positive integer L(ϵ) and
coeﬃcients α−L(ϵ), . . . , αL(ϵ) ∈C such that
u −

(8.9)
(d) For every u, v ∈U
⟨u, v⟩=
∞

ℓ=−∞
⟨u, φℓ⟩⟨v, φℓ⟩∗.
(8.10)
Proof. Since (8.4) & (8.5) hold (by hypothesis), it follows that the additional
condition (c) is, by Deﬁnition 8.2.1, equivalent to {φℓ} being a CONS. It thus only
remains to show that the four conditions are equivalent. We shall prove this by
showing that (a) ⇔(b); that (b) ⇔(c); and that (c) ⇔(d).
That (b) implies (a) is obvious because nothing precludes us from choosing αℓin
(8.7) to be ⟨u, φℓ⟩. That (a) implies (b) follows because, by Note 4.6.7, the signal
L

ℓ=−L
⟨u, φℓ⟩φℓ,
which we denoted in (8.2) by uL, is the projection of u onto the linear subspace
spanned by (φ−L, . . . , φL) and as such, by Proposition 4.6.8, best approximates u
among all the signals in that subspace. Consequently, replacing αℓby ⟨u, φℓ⟩can
only reduce the LHS of (8.7).
To prove (b) ⇒(c) we ﬁrst note that by letting L tend to inﬁnity in (8.3) it follows
that

so to establish (c) we only need to show that if u is in U then ∥u∥2

equality by the Triangle Inequality (Proposition 3.4.1); and the ﬁnal equality by the
orthonormality assumption (8.5) and the Pythagorean Theorem (Theorem 4.5.2).
If Condition (b) holds and if u is in U, then the RHS of (8.12) converges to the
square root of the inﬁnite sum 
ℓ∈Z|⟨u, φℓ⟩|2 and thus gives us the desired upper
bound on ∥u∥2.
We next prove (c) ⇒(b). We assume that (c) holds and that u is in U and set out
to prove (8.8). To that end we ﬁrst note that by the basic properties of the inner
product (3.6)–(3.10) and by the orthonormality (8.5) it follows that

A CONS that you have probably already encountered is the one underlying the
Fourier Series representation. You may have encountered the Fourier Series in the
context of periodic functions, but we shall focus on a slightly diﬀerent view.


of energy-limited signals that vanish outside the interval [−T, T ].

Complete Orthonormal Systems and the Sampling Theorem
Note 8.3.2. The dummy argument t is immaterial in Proposition 8.3.1. Indeed, if
we deﬁne for W > 0 the linear subspace
V =

g ∈L2 : g(f) = 0 whenever |f| > W

,
(8.16)
then the functions deﬁned for every integer ℓby
f 	→
1
√
2W
eiπℓf/W I{|f| ≤W}
(8.17)
form a CONS for this subspace.
This note will be crucial when we next discuss a CONS for the space of energy-
limited signals that are bandlimited to W Hz.
8.4
The Sampling Theorem
We next provide a CONS for the space of energy-limited signals that are band-
limited to W Hz. Recall that if x is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz, then there exists a measurable function3 g: f 	→g(f) satisfying
g(f) = 0,
|f| > W
(8.18)
and
 W
−W
|g(f)|2 df < ∞,
(8.19)
such that
x(t) =
 W
−W
g(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(8.20)
Conversely, if g is any function satisfying (8.18) & (8.19), and if we deﬁne x via
(8.20) as the Inverse Fourier Transform of g, then x is an energy-limited signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz and its L2-Fourier Transform ˆx is equal to (the equivalence
class of) g.
Thus, if, as in (8.16), we denote by V the set of all functions (of frequency) satisfying
(8.18) & (8.19), then the set of all energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to W
Hz is just the image of V under the IFT, i.e., it is the set ˇV, where
ˇV ≜
ˇg : g ∈V

.
(8.21)
By the Mini Parseval Theorem (Proposition 6.2.6 (i)), if x1 and x2 are given by
ˇg1 and ˇg2, where g1, g2 are in V, then
⟨x1, x2⟩= ⟨g1, g2⟩,
(8.22)
i.e.,
⟨ˇg1, ˇg2⟩= ⟨g1, g2⟩,
g1, g2 ∈V.
(8.23)
The following lemma is a simple but very useful consequence of (8.23).
3Loosely speaking, this function is the Fourier Transform of x. But since x is not necessarily
integrable, its FT ˆx is an equivalence class of signals. Thus, more precisely, the equivalence class
of g is the L2 -Fourier Transform of x. Or, stated diﬀerently, g can be any one of the signals in
the equivalence class of ˆx that is zero outside the interval [−W, W ].

Lemma 8.4.1. If {ψℓ} is a CONS for the subspace V, which is deﬁned in (8.16),
then { ˇψℓ} is a CONS for the subspace ˇV, which is deﬁned in (8.21).
Proof. Let {ψℓ} be a CONS for the subspace V. By (8.23),
 ˇψℓ, ˇψℓ′
= ⟨ψℓ, ψℓ′⟩,
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z,
so our assumption that {ψℓ} is a CONS for V (and hence that, a fortiori, it satisﬁes
⟨ψℓ, ψℓ′⟩= I{ℓ= ℓ′} for all ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z) implies that
 ˇψℓ, ˇψℓ′
= I{ℓ= ℓ′},
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z.
It remains to verify that for every x ∈ˇV

where the ﬁrst equality follows from (8.23) (by substituting g for g1 and by sub-
stituting ψℓfor g2); the second from the assumption that {ψℓ} is a CONS for V;
and the ﬁnal equality from (8.23) (by substituting g for g1 and for g2).
Using this lemma and Note 8.3.2 we now derive a CONS for the subspace ˇV of
energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to W Hz.
Proposition 8.4.2 (A CONS for the Subspace of Energy-Limited Signals that
Are Bandlimited to W Hz).
(i) The sequence of signals that are deﬁned for every integer ℓby
t 	→

2W sinc(2Wt + ℓ)

8.4 The Sampling Theorem
155
Using Proposition 8.4.2 and Proposition 8.2.2 we obtain the following L2 version
of the Sampling Theorem.
Theorem 8.4.3 (L2-Sampling Theorem). Let x be an energy-limited signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz, where W > 0, and let
T =
1
2W.
(8.31)
(i) The signal x can be reconstructed from the sequence . . . , x(−T), x(0), x(T), . . .
of its values at integer multiples of T in the sense that

(ii) The signal’s energy can be reconstructed from its samples via the relation
 ∞
−∞
|x(t)|2 dt = T
∞

ℓ=−∞
|x(ℓT)|2.
(iii) If y is another energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then
⟨x, y⟩= T
∞

ℓ=−∞
x(ℓT) y∗(ℓT).
Note 8.4.4. If T ≤1/(2W), then any energy-limited signal x that is bandlimited
to W Hz is also bandlimited to 1/(2T) Hz. Consequently, Theorem 8.4.3 continues
to hold if we replace (8.31) with the condition
0 < T ≤
1
2W.
(8.32)
Table 8.1 on Page 167 highlights the duality between the Sampling Theorem and
the Fourier Series.
We also mention here without proof a version of the Sampling Theorem that al-
lows one to reconstruct the signal pointwise, i.e., at every epoch t. Thus, while
Theorem 8.4.3 guarantees that, as more and more terms in the sum of the shifted
sinc functions are added, the energy in the error function tends to zero, the follow-
ing theorem demonstrates that at every ﬁxed time t the error tends to zero. The
assumptions are fairly mild and are satisﬁed by any energy-limited signal that is
bandlimited to W Hz. (For such signals a proof is sketched in Exercise 8.12.)
Theorem 8.4.5 (Pointwise Sampling Theorem). If the signal x can be represented
as
x(t) =

t ∈R

Proof. See (Pinsky, 2002, Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3, Theorem 4.2.13).
The Sampling Theorem goes by various names.
It is sometimes attributed to
Claude Elwood Shannon (1916–2001), the founder of Information Theory.
But
it also appears in the works of Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kotelnikov (1908–2005),
Harry Nyquist (1889–1976), and Edmund Taylor Whittaker (1873–1956). For fur-
ther references regarding the history of this result and for a survey of many related
results, see (Unser, 2000).
8.5
The Samples of the Convolution
Digital signal processing owes much of its success to the fact that the samples of a
convolution of bandlimited signals can be expressed in terms of the samples of the
signals. This is made precise in the following theorem.

are energy-limited signals
that are bandlimited to W Hz, so their inner product can be computed from their
samples using Theorem 8.4.3 (iii).

Closed Subspaces of L2
Our deﬁnition of a CONS for a subspace U is not quite standard, because we
only assumed that U is a linear subspace; we did not assume that U is closed.
In this section we shall deﬁne closed linear subspaces and derive a condition for

a sequence {φℓ} to form a CONS for a closed subspace U. (The set of energy-
limited signals that vanish outside the interval [−T, T ] is closed, as is the class of
energy-limited signals that are bandlimited to W Hz.)
Before proceeding to deﬁne closed linear subspaces, we pause here to recall that
the space L2 is complete.4
Theorem 8.6.1 (L2 Is Complete). If the sequence u1, u2, . . . of signals in L2 is
such that for any ϵ > 0 there exists a positive integer L(ϵ) such that
∥un −um∥2 < ϵ,
n, m > L(ϵ),
then there exists some function u ∈L2 such that
lim
n→∞∥u −un∥2 = 0.
Proof. See, for example, (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 3, Theorem 3.11).
Deﬁnition 8.6.2 (Closed Subspace). A linear subspace U of L2 is said to be
closed if for any sequence of signals u1, u2, . . . in U and any u ∈L2, the condition
∥u −un∥2 →0 implies that u is indistinguishable from some element of U.
Before stating the next theorem we remind the reader that a bi-inﬁnite sequence
of complex numbers . . . , α−1, α0, α1, . . . is said to be square summable if
∞

ℓ=−∞
|αℓ|2 < ∞.
Theorem 8.6.3 (Riesz-Fischer). Let U be a closed linear subspace of L2, and let
the bi-inﬁnite sequence . . . , φ−1, φ0, φ1, . . . satisfy (8.4) & (8.5). Let the bi-inﬁnite
sequence of complex numbers . . . , α−1, α0, α1, . . . be square summable. Then there
exists an element u in U satisfying

Complete Orthonormal Systems and the Sampling Theorem
Since, by hypothesis, U is a linear subspace and the signals {φℓ} are all in U, it fol-
lows that uL ∈U. By the orthonormality assumption (8.5) and by the Pythagorean
Theorem (Theorem 4.5.2), it follows that
∥un −um∥2
2 =

min{m,n}<|ℓ|≤max{m,n}
|αℓ|2
≤

min{m,n}<|ℓ|<∞
|αℓ|2,
n, m ∈N.
From this and from the square summability of {αℓ}, it follows that for any ϵ > 0
we have that ∥un −um∥2 is smaller than ϵ whenever both n and m are suﬃciently
large. By the completeness of L2 it thus follows that there exists some u′ ∈L2
such that
lim
L→∞∥u′ −uL∥2 = 0.
(8.39)
Since U is closed, and since uL is in U for every L ∈N, it follows from (8.39) that u′
is indistinguishable from some element u of U:
∥u −u′∥2 = 0.
(8.40)
It now follows from (8.39) and (8.40) that
lim
L→∞∥u −uL∥2 = 0,
(8.41)
as can be veriﬁed using (4.14) (with the substitution (u′ −uL) for x and (u −u′)
for y). Combining (8.41) with (8.38) establishes (8.37a).
To establish (8.37b) we use (8.41) and the continuity of the inner product (Propo-
sition 3.4.2) to calculate ⟨u, φℓ⟩for every ﬁxed ℓ∈Z as follows:

(8.5); and the ﬁnal equality because αℓI{|ℓ| ≤L} is equal to αℓ, whenever L is
large enough (i.e., exceeds |ℓ|).
It remains to prove (8.37c). By the orthonormality of {φℓ} and the Pythagorean

It now follows from (8.43), (8.41), and the Sandwich Theorem5 that
lim
L→∞∥uL∥2 = ∥u∥2 ,
(8.44)
which combines with (8.42) to prove (8.37c).
By applying Theorem 8.6.3 to the space of energy-limited signals that are band-
limited to W Hz and to the CONS that we derived for that space in Proposi-
tion 8.4.2 we obtain:
Proposition 8.6.4. Any square-summable bi-inﬁnite sequence of complex numbers
corresponds to the samples at integer multiples of T of an energy-limited signal that
is bandlimited to 1/(2T) Hz. Here T > 0 is arbitrary.
Proof. Let . . . , β−1, β0, β1, . . . be a square-summable bi-inﬁnite sequence of com-
plex numbers, and let W = 1/(2T). We seek a signal u that is an energy-limited
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz and whose samples are given by u(ℓT) = βℓ,
for every integer ℓ. Since the set of all energy-limited signals that are bandlimited
to W Hz is a closed linear subspace of L2, and since the sequence { ˇψℓ} (given ex-
plicitly in (8.28) as ˇψℓ: t 	→
√
2W sinc(2Wt+ℓ)) is an orthonormal sequence in that
subspace, it follows from Theorem 8.6.3 (with the substitution of ˇψℓfor φℓand of

We now give an alternative characterization of a CONS for a closed subspace of L2.
This result will not be used later in the book.
Proposition 8.6.5 (Characterization of a CONS for a Closed Subspace).
(i) If the bi-inﬁnite sequence {φℓ} is a CONS for the linear subspace U ⊆L2,
then an element of U whose inner product with φℓis zero for every integer ℓ
must have zero energy:

5The Sandwich Theorem states that if the sequences of real number {an}, {bn} and {cn} are
such that bn ≤an ≤cn for every n, and if the sequences {bn} and {cn} converge to the same
limit, then {an} also converges to that limit.

Complete Orthonormal Systems and the Sampling Theorem
(ii) If U is a closed subspace of L2 and if the bi-inﬁnite sequence {φℓ} satisﬁes
(8.4) & (8.5), then Condition (8.47) is equivalent to the condition that {φℓ}
forms a CONS for U.
Proof. We begin by proving Part (i). By deﬁnition, if {φℓ} is a CONS for U, then
(8.6) must hold for every u ∈U. Consequently, if for some u ∈U we have that
⟨u, φℓ⟩is zero for all ℓ∈Z, then the RHS of (8.6) is zero and hence the LHS must
also be zero, thus showing that u must be of zero energy.
We next turn to Part (ii) and assume that U is closed and that the bi-inﬁnite
sequence {φℓ} satisﬁes (8.4) & (8.5). That the condition that {φℓ} is a CONS
implies Condition (8.47) follows from Part (i). It thus remains to show that if
Condition (8.47) holds, then {φℓ} is a CONS. To prove this we now assume that U
is a closed subspace; that {φℓ} satisﬁes (8.4) & (8.5); and that (8.47) holds and
set out to prove that

(8.48)
To establish (8.48) ﬁx some arbitrary u ∈U. Since U ⊆L2, the fact that u is
in U implies that it is of ﬁnite energy, which combines with (8.3) to imply that the
bi-inﬁnite sequence . . . , ⟨u, φ−1⟩, ⟨u, φ0⟩, ⟨u, φ1⟩, . . . is square summable. Since,
by hypothesis, U is closed, this implies, by Theorem 8.6.3 (with the substitution
of ⟨u, φℓ⟩for αℓ), that there exists some element ˜u ∈U such that

(8.49c)
By (8.49b) it follows that the element u −˜u of U satisﬁes
⟨u −˜u, φℓ⟩= 0,
ℓ∈Z,
and hence, by Condition (8.47), is of zero energy
∥u −˜u∥2 = 0,
(8.50)
so u and ˜u are indistinguishable and hence
∥u∥2 = ∥˜u∥2 .
This combines with (8.49c) to prove (8.48).

An Isomorphism
In this section we collect the results of Theorem 8.4.3 and Proposition 8.6.4 into a
single theorem about the isomorphism between the space of energy-limited signals
that are bandlimited to W Hz and the space of square-summable sequences. This
theorem is at the heart of quantization schemes for bandlimited signals. It demon-
strates that to describe a bandlimited signal one can use discrete-time processing to
quantize its samples and one can then map the quantized samples to a bandlimited
signal. The energy in the error signal corresponding to the diﬀerence between the
original signal and its description is then proportional to the sum of the squared
diﬀerences between the samples of the original signal and the quantized version.
Theorem 8.7.1 (Bandlimited Signals and Square-Summable Sequences). Let
T = 1/(2W), where W > 0.
(i) If u is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then the bi-
inﬁnite sequence
. . . , u(−T), u(0), u(T), u(2T), . . .
consisting of its samples taken at integer multiples of T is square summable
and

to W Hz, then

(iii) If {αℓ} is a bi-inﬁnite square-summable sequence, then there exists an energy-
limited signal u that is bandlimited to W Hz such that its samples are given
by
u(ℓT) = αℓ,
ℓ∈Z.
(iv) The mapping that maps every energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W
Hz to the square-summable sequence consisting of its samples is linear.

Chapter 9
Sampling Real Passband Signals
9.1
Introduction
In this chapter we present a procedure for representing a real energy-limited pass-
band signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around a carrier frequency fc using com-
plex numbers that we accumulate at a rate of W complex numbers per second.
Alternatively, since we can represent every complex number as a pair of real num-
bers (its real and imaginary parts), we can view our procedure as allowing us to
represent the signal using real numbers that we accumulate at a rate of 2W real
numbers per second. Thus we propose to accumulate
2W real samples per second,
or
W complex samples per second.
Note that the carrier frequency fc plays no role here (provided, of course, that
fc > W/2): the rate at which we accumulate real numbers to describe the passband
signal does not depend on fc.1
For real baseband signals this feat is easily accomplished using the Sampling The-
orem as follows. A real energy-limited baseband signal that is bandlimited to W
Hz can be reconstructed from its (real) samples that are taken 1/(2W) seconds
apart (Theorem 8.4.3), so the signal can be reconstructed from real numbers (its
samples) that are being accumulated at the rate of 2W real samples per second.
For passband signals we cannot achieve this feat by invoking the Sampling Theorem
directly. Even though, by Corollary 7.7.3, every energy-limited passband signal xPB
that is bandlimited to W Hz around the center frequency fc is also an energy-limited
bandlimited (baseband) signal, we are only guaranteed that xPB be bandlimited
to fc + W/2 Hz. Consequently, if we were to apply the Sampling Theorem directly
1But the carrier frequency fc does play a role in the reconstruction.

9.2 Complex Sampling

to xPB we would have to sample xPB every 1/(2fc + W) seconds, i.e., we would
have to accumulate 2fc + W real numbers per second, which can be much higher
than 2W, especially in wireless communications where fc ≫W.
Instead of applying the Sampling Theorem directly to xPB, the idea is to apply it to
xPB’s baseband representation xBB. Suppose that xPB is a real energy-limited pass-
band signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. By Theo-
rem 7.7.12 (vii), it can be represented using its baseband representation xBB, which
is a complex baseband signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz (Theorem 7.7.12 (v)).
Consequently, by the L2-Sampling Theorem (Theorem 8.4.3), xBB can be described
by sampling it at a rate of W samples per second. Since the baseband signal is
complex, its samples are also, in general, complex. Thus, in sampling xBB every
1/W seconds we are accumulating one complex sample every 1/W seconds. Since
we can recover xPB from xBB and fc, it follows that, as we wanted, we have found
a way to describe xPB using complex numbers that are accumulated at a rate of W
complex numbers per second.
9.2
Complex Sampling
Recall from Section 7.7.3 (Theorem 7.7.12) that a real energy-limited passband
signal xPB that is bandlimited to W Hz around a carrier frequency fc can be
represented using its baseband representation xBB as
xPB(t) = 2 Re

and where the cutoﬀfrequency Wc can be chosen arbitrarily in the range
W
2 ≤Wc ≤2fc −W
2 .
(9.3)
The signal xBB is an energy-limited complex baseband signal that is bandlimited
to W/2 Hz. Being bandlimited to W/2 Hz, it follows from the L2-Sampling The-
orem that xBB can be reconstructed from its samples taken 1/(2 (W/2)) = 1/W
seconds apart. We denote these samples by

The procedure of taking a real passband signal xPB and sampling its baseband
representation to obtain the samples (9.8) is called complex sampling.
It is
depicted in Figure 9.1.
The passband signal xPB is ﬁrst separately multiplied
by t 	→cos(2πfct) and by t 	→−sin(2πfct), which are generated using a local
oscillator and a 90◦-phase shifter. Each result is fed to a lowpass ﬁlter with cutoﬀ
frequency Wc to produce the in-phase and quadrature components respectively.
Each component is then sampled at a rate of W real samples per second.

We summarize how a passband signal can be reconstructed from the samples of its
baseband representation in the following theorem.
Theorem 9.3.1 (The Sampling Theorem for Passband Signals). Let xPB be a
real energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc. For every integer ℓ, let xBB(ℓ/W) denote the time-(ℓ/W) sample of
the baseband representation xBB of xPB; see (9.5) and (9.8).

Part (iii) is a special case of Part (iv) corresponding to yPB being equal to xPB. It
thus only remains to prove Part (iv). This is done by noting that if xBB and yBB

Chapter 10
Mapping Bits to Waveforms
10.1
What Is Modulation?
Data bits are mathematical entities that have no physical attributes. To send them
over a channel, one needs to ﬁrst map them into some physical signal, which is
then “fed” into a channel to produce a physical signal at the channel’s output. For
example, when we send data over a telephone line, the data bits are ﬁrst converted
to an electrical signal, which then inﬂuences the voltage measured at the other
end of the line. (We use the term “inﬂuences” because the signal measured at the
other end of the line is usually not identical to the channel input: it is typically
attenuated and also corrupted by thermal noise and other distortions introduced
by various conversions in the telephone exchange system.) Similarly, in a wireless
system, the data bits are mapped to an electromagnetic wave that then inﬂuences
the electromagnetic ﬁeld measured at the receiver antenna. In magnetic recording,
data bits are written onto a magnetic medium by a mapping that maps them to
a magnetization pattern, which is then measured (with some distortion and some
noise) by the magnetic head at some later time when the data are read.
In the ﬁrst example the bits are mapped to continuous-time waveforms correspond-
ing to the voltage across an impedance, whereas in the last example the bits are
mapped to a spatial waveform corresponding to diﬀerent magnetizations at dif-
ferent locations across the magnetic medium. While some of the theory we shall
develop holds for both cases, we shall focus here mainly on channels of the former
type, where the channel input signal is some function of time rather than space.
We shall further focus on cases where the channel input corresponds to a time-
varying voltage across a resistor, a time-varying current through a resistor, or a
time-varying electric ﬁeld, so the energy required to transmit the signal is propor-
tional to the time integral of its square. Thus, if x(t) denotes the channel input at
time t, then we shall refer to
 t+Δ
t
x2(τ) dτ as the transmitted energy during the
time interval beginning at time t and ending at time t + Δ.
There are many mappings of bits to waveforms, and our goal is to ﬁnd “good” ones.
We will, of course, have to deﬁne some ﬁgures of merit to compare the quality of
diﬀerent mappings. We shall refer to the mapping of bits to a physical waveform
as modulation and to the part of the system that performs the modulation as the
modulator.

10.2 Modulating One Bit
177
Without going into too much detail, we can list a few qualitative requirements of a
modulator. The modulation should be robust with respect to channel impairments,
so that the receiver at the other end of the channel can reliably decode the data bits
from the channel output. Also, the modulator should have reasonable complexity.
Finally, in many applications we require that the transmitted signal be of limited
power so as to preserve the battery. In wireless applications the transmitted signal
may also be subject to spectral restrictions so as to not interfere with other systems.
10.2
Modulating One Bit
One does not typically expect to design a communication system in order to convey
only one data bit. The purpose of the modulator is typically to map an entire bit
stream to a waveform that extends over the entire life of the communication system.
Nevertheless, for pedagogic reasons, it is good to ﬁrst consider the simplest scenario
of modulating a single bit. In this case the modulator is fully characterized by two
functions x0(·) and x1(·) with the understanding that if the data bit D is equal
to zero, then the modulator produces the waveform x0(·) and that otherwise it
produces x1(·). Thus, the signal produced by the modulator is given by
X(t) =

x0(t)
if D = 0,
x1(t)
if D = 1,
t ∈R.
(10.1)
For example, we could choose
x0(t) =

A e−t/T
if t/T ≥0,
0
otherwise,
t ∈R,
and
x1(t) =

A
if 0 ≤t/T ≤1,
0
otherwise,
t ∈R,
where T = 1 sec and where A is a constant such that A2 has units of power.
This may seem like an odd way of writing these waveforms, but we have our
reasons: we typically think of t as having units of time, and we try to avoid
applying transcendental functions (such as the exponential function) to quantities
with units. Also, we think of the squared transmitted waveform as having units
of power, whereas we think of the transcendental functions as returning unit-less
arguments. Hence the introduction of the constant A with the understanding that
A2 has units of power.
We denoted the bit to be sent by an uppercase letter (D) because we like to de-
note random quantities (such as random variables, random vectors, and stochastic
processes) by uppercase letters, and we think of the transmitted bit as a random
quantity.
Indeed, if the transmitted bit were deterministic, there would be no
need to transmit it! This may seem like a statement made in jest, but it is ac-
tually very important. In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, engineers often
analyzed the performance of (analog) communication systems by analyzing their
performance in transmitting some particular signal, e.g., a sine wave. Nobody, of

Mapping Bits to Waveforms
course, transmitted such “boring” signals, because those could always be produced
at the receiver using a local oscillator. In the second half of the twentieth century,
especially following the work of Claude Shannon, engineers realized that it is only
meaningful to view the data to be transmitted as random, i.e., as quantities that
are unknown at the receiver and also unknown to the system designer prior to the
system’s deployment. We thus view the bit to be sent D as a random variable.
Often we will assume that it takes on the values 0 and 1 equiprobably. This is a
good assumption if prior to transmission a data compression algorithm is used.
By the same token, we view the transmitted signal as a random quantity, and
hence the uppercase X. In fact, if we employ the above signaling scheme, then at
every time instant t′ ∈R the value X(t′) of the transmitted waveform is a random
variable. For example, at time T/2 the value of the transmitted waveform is X(T/2),
which is a random variable that takes on the values A e−1/2 and A equiprobably.
Similarly, at time 2T the value of the transmitted waveform is X(2T), which is a
random variable taking on the values e−2 and 0 equiprobably. Mathematicians call
such a waveform a random process or a stochastic process (SP). This will be
deﬁned formally in Section 12.2.
It is useful to think about a random process as a function of two arguments: time
and “luck” or, more precisely, as a function of time and the result of all the random
experiments in the system. For a ﬁxed instant of time t ∈R, we have that X(t)
is a random variable, i.e., a real-valued function of the randomness in the system
(in this case the realization of D).
Alternatively, for a ﬁxed realization of the
randomness in the system, the random process is a deterministic function of time.
These two views will be used interchangeably in this book.
10.3
From Bits to Real Numbers
Many of the popular modulation schemes can be viewed as operating in two stages.
In the ﬁrst stage the data bits are mapped to real numbers, and in the second stage
the real numbers are mapped to a continuous-time waveform. If we denote by k the
number of data bits that will be transmitted by the system during its lifetime (or
from the moment it is turned on until it is turned oﬀ), and if we denote the data
bits by D1, D2, . . . , Dk, then the ﬁrst stage can be described as the application of
a mapping ϕ(·) that maps length-k sequences of bits to length-n sequences of real
numbers:
ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn
(d1, . . . , dk) 	→(x1, . . . , xn).
From an engineering point of view, it makes little sense to allow for the encoding
function to map two diﬀerent binary k-tuples to the same real n-tuple, because
this would result in the transmitted waveforms corresponding to the two k-tuples
being identical.
This may cause errors even in the absence of noise.
We shall
therefore assume throughout that the mapping ϕ(·) is one-to-one (injective) so
no two distinct data k-tuples are mapped to the same n-tuple of real numbers.
An example of a mapping that maps bits to real numbers is the mapping that maps

each data bit Dj to the real number Xj according to the rule
Xj =

+1
if Dj = 0,
−1
if Dj = 1,
j = 1, . . . , k.
(10.2)
In this example one real symbol Xj is produced for every data bit, so n = k. For
this reason we say that this mapping has the rate of one bit per real symbol.
As another example consider the case where k is even and the data bits {Dj} are
broken into pairs
(D1, D2), (D3, D4), . . . , (Dk−1, Dk)
and each pair of data bits is then mapped to a single real number according to the
rule
(D2j−1, D2j) 	→
⎧
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎩
+3
if D2j−1 = D2j = 0,
+1
if D2j−1 = 0 and D2j = 1,
−3
if D2j−1 = D2j = 1,
−1
if D2j−1 = 1 and D2j = 0,
j = 1, . . . , k/2.
(10.3)
In this case n = k/2, and we say that the mapping has the rate of two bits per real
symbol.
Note that the rate of the mapping could also be a fraction. Indeed, if each data
bit Dj produces two real numbers according to the repetition law
Dj 	→

(+1, +1)
if Dj = 0,
(−1, −1)
if Dj = 1,
j = 1, . . . , k,
(10.4)
then n = 2k, and we say that the mapping is of rate half a bit per real symbol.
Since there is a natural correspondence between R2 and C, i.e., between pairs of real
numbers and complex numbers (where a pair of real numbers (x, y) corresponds
to the complex number x + iy), the rate of the above mapping (10.4) can also be
stated as one bit per complex symbol. This may seem like an odd way of stating the
rate, but it has some advantages that will become apparent later when we discuss
the mapping of real (or complex) numbers to waveforms and the Nyquist Criterion.
10.4
Block-Mode Mapping of Bits to Real Numbers
The examples we gave in Section 10.3 of mappings ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn have something
in common. In each of those examples the mapping can be described as follows: the
data bits D1, . . . , Dk are ﬁrst grouped into binary K-tuples; each K-tuple is then
mapped to a real N-tuple by applying some mapping enc: {0, 1}K →RN; and the
so-produced real N-tuples are then concatenated to form the sequence X1, . . . , Xn,
where n = (k/K)N.
In the ﬁrst example K = N = 1 and the mapping of K-tuples to N-tuples is the
mapping (10.2). In the second example K = 2 and N = 1 with the mapping (10.3).
And in the third example K = 1 and N = 2 with the repetition mapping (10.4).
To describe such mappings ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn more formally we need the notion of
a binary-to-reals block encoder, which we deﬁne next.

an encoder as a (K, N) block encoder. Also note that “one-to-one” means that
no two distinct binary K-tuples may be mapped to the same real N-tuple.
We say that an encoder ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn operates in block-mode using the
(K, N) binary-to-reals block encoder enc(·) if
1) k is divisible by K;
2) n is given by (k/K) N; and
3) ϕ(·) maps the binary sequence D1, . . . , Dk to the sequence X1, . . . , Xn by
parsing the sequence D1, . . . , Dk into consecutive length-K binary tuples and
by then concatenating the results of applying enc(·) to each such K-tuple as
in Figure 10.1.
If k is not divisible by K, we often introduce zero padding.
In this case we
choose k′ to be the smallest integer that is no smaller than k and that is divisible
by K, i.e.,
k′ =

From Real Numbers to Waveforms with Linear Modulation
There are numerous ways to map a sequence of real numbers X1, . . . , Xn to a real-
valued signal. Here we shall focus on mappings that have a linear structure. This
additional structure simpliﬁes the implementation of the modulator and demodu-
lator. It is described next.
Suppose we wish to modulate the k data bits D1, . . . , Dk, and suppose that we have
mapped these bits to the n real numbers X1, . . . , Xn. Here n can be smaller, equal,
or greater than k. In a linear modulation scheme the transmitted waveform X(·),
which we also denote X, is given by
X(t) = A
n

ℓ=1
Xℓgℓ(t),
t ∈R,
(10.6)
where the deterministic real waveforms g1, . . . , gn are speciﬁed in advance, and
where A ≥0 is a scaling factor.1
The waveform X(·) can be thus viewed as
a scaled-by-A linear combination of the tuple

g1, . . . , gn

with the coeﬃcients
X1, . . . , Xn:
X = A

The transmitted energy takes on a particularly simple form if the waveforms gℓ(·)

(10.9)
As an exercise, the reader is encouraged to verify that there is no loss in generality
in assuming that the waveforms {gℓ} are orthonormal. More precisely:
Theorem 10.5.1. Suppose that the waveform X(·) is generated from the binary
k-tuple D1, . . . , Dk by applying the mapping ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn and by then linearly
modulating the resulting n-tuple ϕ(D1, . . . , Dk) using the waveforms {gℓ}n
ℓ=1 as in
(10.6).
Then there exist an integer 1 ≤n′ ≤n; a mapping ϕ′ : {0, 1}k →Rn′; and n′
orthonormal signals {φℓ}n′
ℓ=1 such that if X′(·) is generated from D1, . . . , Dk by
applying linear modulation to ϕ′(D1, . . . , Dk) using the orthonormal waveforms
{φℓ}n′
ℓ=1, then X′(·) and X(·) are indistinguishable for every k-tuple D1, . . . , Dk.
Proof. The proof is based on the Gram-Schmidt procedure (Section 4.6.6) and is
left as an exercise (Exercise 10.7).
Motivated by this theorem, we shall focus on linear modulation with orthonormal
functions. But please note that even if the transmitted waveform satisﬁes (10.8),
the received waveform might not. For example, the channel might consist of a
linear ﬁlter that could destroy the orthogonality.
10.6
Recovering the Signal Coeﬃcients with a Matched Filter
Suppose now that the binary k-tuple (D1, . . . , Dk) is mapped to the real n-tuple
(X1, . . . , Xn) using the mapping
ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn
(10.10)
and that the n-tuple (X1, . . . , Xn) is then mapped to the waveform

Recovering the symbols from the transmitted waveform using a
matched ﬁlter when (10.14) is satisﬁed.
How can we recover the k-tuple D1, . . . , Dk from X(·)? The decoder’s problem
is, of course, harder, because the decoder usually does not have access to the
transmitted waveform X(·) but only to the received waveform, which may be a
noisy and distorted version of X(·). Nevertheless, it is instructive to consider the
noiseless and distortionless problem ﬁrst.
If we are able to recover the real numbers {Xℓ}n
ℓ=1 from the received signal X(·),
and if the mapping ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn is one-to-one (as we assume), then the data
bits {Dj}k
j=1 can be reconstructed from X(·). Thus, the question is how to recover
{Xℓ}n
ℓ=1 from X(·). But this is easy if the functions {φℓ}n
ℓ=1 are orthonormal,
because in this case, by Proposition 4.6.4 (i), Xℓis given by the scaled inner
product between X and φℓ:
Xℓ= 1
A ⟨X, φℓ⟩,
ℓ= 1, . . . , n.
(10.13)
Consequently, we can compute Xℓby feeding X to a matched ﬁlter for φℓand
scaling the time-0 output by 1/A (Section 5.8). To recover {Xℓ}n
ℓ=1 we thus need n
matched ﬁlters, one matched to each of the waveforms {φℓ}.
The implementation becomes much simpler if the functions {φℓ} have an additional
structure, namely, if they are all time shifts of some function φ(·):
φℓ(t) = φ(t −ℓTs),

ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}, t ∈R

.
(10.14)
In this case it follows from Corollary 5.8.3 that we can compute all the inner
products {⟨X, φℓ⟩} using one matched ﬁlter of impulse response ~φ by feeding X
to the ﬁlter and sampling its output at the appropriate times:
Xℓ= 1

a single matched ﬁlter if the pulses {φℓ} satisfy (10.14).

Figure 10.4 depicts a signal φ(·) whose time shifts by integer multiples of Ts are
orthonormal (when α is chosen so that it be of unit energy).
In fact, for this
signal the time shifts do not overlap in the sense that for ℓ̸= 0 the product
φ(t) φ(t −ℓTs) is zero at every epoch t ∈R. But, as we shall see in Chapter 11,
we can achieve orthonormality even if the time shifts do overlap. This is plausible
because t 	→φ(t) φ(t −ℓTs) can integrate to zero even if it is not identically zero.

ℓ=1
Xℓφ(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R,
(10.16)
which is a special case of Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), which we

ℓ=1
Xℓg(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R,
(10.17)
for some scaling factor A ≥0, some function g: R →R, and some constant Ts > 0.
The function g (always assumed Borel measurable2) is called the pulse shape; the
constant Ts is called the baud period; and its reciprocal 1/Ts is called the baud
rate.3 The units of Ts are seconds, and one often refers to the units of 1/Ts as real
symbols per second. PAM can thus be viewed as a special case of linear modulation
(10.6) with gℓbeing given for every ℓ∈{1, . . . , n} by the mapping t 	→g(t −ℓTs).
The signal (10.16) can be viewed as a PAM signal where the pulse shape φ satisﬁes
the orthonormality condition

t 	→φ(t −ℓTs), t 	→φ(t −ℓ′Ts)

= I{ℓ= ℓ′},
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , n},
(10.18)
which is implied by (10.12) and (10.14).
In this book we shall typically denote the PAM pulse shape by g. But we shall
use φ if we assume an additional orthonormality condition such as (10.18). In this
case we shall refer to 1/Ts as having units of real dimensions per second:

φ satisﬁes (10.18).
(10.19)
Note that according to Theorem 10.5.1 there is no loss in generality in assuming
that the pulses {φℓ} are orthonormal. There is, however, a loss in generality in
assuming that they satisfy (10.14).
10.8
Constellations
Recall that in PAM the data bits D1, . . . , Dk are ﬁrst mapped to the real n-tuple
X1, . . . , Xn using a one-to-one mapping ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn, and that these real
numbers are then mapped to the waveform X(·) via (10.17). Since there are only
2k diﬀerent binary k-tuples, it follows that each symbol Xℓcan take on at most
2k diﬀerent values. The set of values that Xℓcan take on may, in general, depend
on ℓ. The union of all these sets (over ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}) is called the constellation of
the mapping ϕ(·). Denoting the constellation of ϕ(·) by X, we thus have that a real
number x is in X if, and only if, for some choice of the binary k-tuple (d1, . . . , dk)
and for some ℓ∈{1, . . . , n} the ℓ-th component of ϕ

(d1, . . . , dk)

is equal to x.
For example, the constellation corresponding to the mapping (10.2) is the set
{−1, +1}; the constellation corresponding to (10.3) is the set {−3, −1, +1, +3};
2The Borel σ-algebra is the smallest σ-algebra containing the open sets. A function g : R →
R is Borel measurable if for every α ∈R the set {ξ ∈R : g(ξ) < α} is an element of the Borel
σ-algebra.
3These terms honor the French engineer Jean-Maurice-´Emile Baudot (1845–1903) who in-
vented a telegraph printing system. Some authors refer to the baud rate as “baud.” The term
baud period is also not completely standard.

The number of points in the constellation X is just # X, i.e., the number of
elements (cardinality) of the set X.
The minimum distance δ of a constellation is the Euclidean distance between
the closest distinct elements in the constellation:
δ ≜min
x,x′∈X
x̸=x′
|x −x′|.
(10.22)
The scaling of the constellation is arbitrary because of the scaling factor A in the
signal’s description. Thus, the signal A 
ℓXℓg(t −ℓTs), where Xℓtakes values in
the set {±1} is of constellation {−1, +1}, but it can also be expressed in the form

ℓtakes values in the set {−1/2, +1/2},
i.e., as a PAM signal of constellation {−1/2, +1/2}.
Diﬀerent authors choose to normalize the constellation in diﬀerent ways.

common normalization is to express the elements of the constellation as multiples

Uncoded Transmission
Classifying a coding scheme as uncoded sounds like an oxymoron, but it is not.
The term “uncoded transmission” or “uncoded communication” is important and
will be clariﬁed next. Recall that the mapping ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn maps the data
bits D1, . . . , Dk to the real symbols X1, . . . , Xn. As we have seen in Section 10.8,
the constellation X is the smallest subset of R for which—irrespective of the data
bits—each of the symbols X1, . . . , Xn is in X. Thus, the range of ϕ is contained in
X n, and X is the smallest set for which this holds. We emphasize that the range
of ϕ can be a strict subset of X n: some sequences in X n may not be producible
by the encoder irrespective of the data bits fed to it. This is the case, for example,
when the encoder is based on the repetition mapping (10.4) and X = {+1, −1},
because in this case X1 must equal X2, and sequences beginning with +1, −1 are
in X n but not in the range of ϕ.
Engineers say that the transmission is uncoded or that the system is uncoded
if the range of ϕ equals X n

ϕ(d) : d ∈{0, 1}k
= X n,
(10.28)
i.e., if every sequence in X n can be produced by the encoder by feeding it the
appropriate data sequence. To see why they use this terminology, it is instructive
to consider some examples.
Examples when (10.28) does hold are when we employ antipodal signaling (10.2)
or the mapping (10.3). More generally, it holds whenever the encoder operates in
block-mode using a (K, 1) block encoder (and k is divisible by K so no zero padding
is required). Such encoders do not rule out any output sequence in X n and they
are therefore error prone (hence “uncoded”). An example when (10.28) does not
hold is when the encoder operates in block-mode using the (1, 2) (repetition) block
encoder of (10.4). More generally, (10.28) does not hold whenever the encoder
operates in block-mode using a (K, N) block encoder that is nontrivial in the sense
that its range is a strict subset of X N. An uncoded system does not therefore
employ any such nontrivial block codes.

Mapping Bits to Waveforms
Since we are assuming throughout that ϕ is one-to-one (Section 10.3), the system
is uncoded if, and only if, ϕ: {0, 1}k →X n is one-to-one and onto, i.e., a bijection.
10.10
Bandwidth Considerations
Without knowing the data bits that produced the PAM signal, it is very diﬃcult
to say much about it. A notable exception is the bandwidth, which is essentially
determined by the pulse shape: unless A is zero or the symbols x1, . . . , xn are
all zero, the bandwidth of the PAM signal is equal to the bandwidth of the pulse
shape g. One part of the proof of this statement hinges on elementary properties of
the Fourier Transform. The other hinges on the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
(Rudin, 1987, Chapter 10, Theorem 10.25), which states that the number of roots
of a nonzero polynomial cannot exceed its degree (and, in fact, equals its degree if
we account for the multiplicity of the roots.)
We present the result in a slightly more general form.
Lemma 10.10.1. Let g: R →C be an integrable signal of bandwidth W.
Let
cm, . . . , cn be complex numbers that are not all zero, where m and n are integers
satisfying m ≤n. Let Ts be positive. Then the signal t 	→n
ℓ=m cℓg(t −ℓTs) is an
integrable signal of the same bandwidth as g, namely, W.
Proof. Let g, m, n, and cm, . . . , cn be as above, and deﬁne the signal
h: t 	→
n

ℓ=m
cℓg(t −ℓTs).
Its Fourier Transform ˆh is

ℓ=0
cℓ+m zℓ

z=e−i2πfTs
ˆg(f),
f ∈R.
(10.29)
It thus follows that at every frequency at which ˆg is zero so is ˆh, and hence the
bandwidth of h cannot exceed that of g. It remains to show that the bandwidth
of h is not smaller than that of g. We shall establish this by showing that there
can be at most a ﬁnite number of frequencies where ˆh is zero but ˆg is not.
Since ˆg is zero outside the band [−W, W ], we need to show that there are at
most a ﬁnite number of frequencies f ∈[−W, W ] where ˆh(f) is zero but ˆg(f) is
not. For f to be such a frequency, the function z 	→zm n−m
ℓ=0 cℓ+m zℓmust be
zero at e−i2πfTs. Since zm has no roots on the unit circle {z ∈C : |z| = 1}, the
only way a frequency f can satisfy this condition is if e−i2πfTs is a root of the
complex polynomial z 	→n−m
ℓ=0 cℓ+m zℓ, whose degree is at most n −m. Since, by

hypothesis, the coeﬃcients cm, . . . , cn are not all zero, this polynomial is not the
zero polynomial. Consequently, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it has at
most n −m roots. Of these roots, only some, say d, are on the unit circle. Denote
these
eiθ1, . . . , eiθd,
where θ1, . . . , θd ∈[−π, π) and d ≤n −m. We conclude that only at frequencies f
for which e−i2πfTs is equal to eiθν for some ν ∈{1, . . . , d} can ˆh(f) be zero and
ˆg(f) not. Since e−i2πfTs can equal eiθν only if f has the form
−θν
2πTs
+ η
Ts
for some integer η, it follows that there are a ﬁnite number of frequencies in the
band [−W, W ] where e−i2πfTs equals eiθν. Consequently, there are at most a ﬁnite
number of frequencies in the band [−W, W ] where ˆh is zero and ˆg is not, and the
bandwidth of h cannot be smaller than that of g.
Corollary 10.10.2 (The Bandwidth of a PAM Is that of the Pulse Shape). If a
PAM signal (with an integrable pulse shape) is not zero, then its bandwidth is equal
to the bandwidth of the pulse shape.
Proof. If the pulse shape is of ﬁnite bandwidth W, then the result follows directly
from the lemma. Otherwise, the result follows by noting that there are a count-
able number of frequencies f where e−i2πTs equals eiθν, and the ﬁnite union of a
countable number of frequencies is countable. Consequently, there are at most a
countable number of frequencies where the FT of the PAM signal is zero whereas
that of the pulse shape is not.
10.11
Design Considerations
Designing a communication system employing PAM with a block encoder entails
making choices. We need to choose the PAM parameters A, Ts, and g, and we
need to choose a (K, N) block encoder enc(·). These choices greatly inﬂuence the
overall system characteristics such as the transmitted power, bandwidth, and the
performance of the system in the presence of noise. To design a system well, we
must understand the eﬀect of the design choices on the overall system at three
levels. At the ﬁrst level we must understand which design parameters inﬂuence
which overall system characteristics.
At the second level we must understand
how the design parameters inﬂuence the system. And at the third level we must
understand how to choose the design parameters so as to optimize the system
characteristics subject to the given constraints.
In this book we focus on the ﬁrst two levels. The third requires tools from Infor-
mation Theory and from Coding Theory that are beyond the scope of this book.
Here we oﬀer a preview of the ﬁrst level. We thus brieﬂy and informally explain
which design choices inﬂuence which overall system properties.
To simplify the preview, we shall assume in this section that the time shifts of the
pulse shape by integer multiples of the baud period are orthonormal. Consequently,

Mapping Bits to Waveforms
we shall denote the pulse shape by φ and assume that (10.18) holds. We shall also
assume that k and n tend to inﬁnity as in the bi-inﬁnite block mode discussed in
Section 14.5.2. Roughly speaking this assumption is tantamount to the assumption
that the system has been running since time −∞and that it will continue running
until time +∞.
Our discussion is extremely informal, and we apologize to the reader for discussing
concepts that we have not yet deﬁned. Readers who are aggravated by this practice
may choose to skip this section; the issues will be revisited in Chapter 29 after
everything has been deﬁned and all the claims proved.
The key observation we wish to highlight is that, to a great extent,
the choice of the block encoder enc(·) can be decoupled from the
choice of the pulse shape φ. The bandwidth and power spectral
density depend hardly at all on enc(·) and very much on φ, whereas
the probability of error on the white Gaussian noise channel de-
pends very much on enc(·) and not at all on φ.
This observation greatly simpliﬁes the design problem because it means that, rather
than optimizing over φ and enc(·) jointly, we can choose each of them separately.
We next brieﬂy discuss the diﬀerent overall system characteristics and which design
choices inﬂuence them.
Data Rate:
The data rate Rb that the system supports is determined by the baud
period Ts and by the rate K/N of the encoder. It is given by
Rb = 1
Ts
K
N
 bit
sec

.
Power:
The transmitted power does not depend on the pulse shape φ (Theo-
rem 14.5.2). It is determined by the amplitude A, the baud period Ts, and the
block encoder enc(·). In fact, if the constellation is centered and the transmission
is uncoded, then the transmitted power is determined by A, Ts, and the second
moment of the constellation.
Power Spectral Density:
If the block encoder enc(·) is such that when it is fed
the data bits it produces zero-mean and uncorrelated symbols of equal variance,
then the power spectral density is determined by A, Ts, and φ only; it is unaﬀected
by enc(·) (Section 15.4).
Bandwidth:
The bandwidth of the transmitted waveform is equal to the band-
width of the pulse shape φ (Corollary 10.10.2 and Theorem 15.4.1). We will see in
Chapter 11 that for the orthonormality (10.18) to hold (for all n), the bandwidth W
of the pulse shape must satisfy
W ≥
1
2Ts

10.12 Some Implementation Considerations
191
In Chapter 11 we shall also see how to design φ so as to satisfy (10.18) and so as
to have its bandwidth as close as we wish to 1/(2Ts).4
Probability of Error:
It is a remarkable fact that the pulse shape φ does not aﬀect
the performance of the system on the additive white Gaussian noise channel. Per-
formance is determined only by A, Ts, and the block encoder enc(·) (Section 26.4.2).
The preceding discussion focused on PAM, but many of the results also hold for
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, which is discussed in Chapters 16, 18, and 28.
10.12
Some Implementation Considerations
It is instructive to consider some of the issues related to the generation of a PAM
signal
X(t) = A
n

ℓ=1
Xℓg(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R.
(10.30)
Here we focus on delay, causality, and digital implementation.
10.12.1
Delay
To illustrate the delay issue in PAM, suppose that the pulse shape g(·) is strictly
positive. In this case we note that, irrespective of which epoch t′ ∈R we consider,
the calculation of X(t′) requires knowledge of the entire n-tuple X1, . . . , Xn. Since
the sequence X1, . . . , Xn cannot typically be determined in its entirety unless the
entire sequence D1, . . . , Dk is determined ﬁrst, it follows that, when g(·) is strictly
positive, the modulator cannot produce X(t′) before observing the entire data
sequence D1, . . . , Dk. And this is true for any t′ ∈R! Since in the back of our
minds we think about D1, . . . , Dk as the data bits that will be sent during the
entire life of the system or, at least, from the moment it is turned on until it is
shut oﬀ, it is unrealistic to expect the modulator to observe the entire sequence
D1, . . . , Dk before producing any input to the channel.
The engineering solution to this problem is to ﬁnd some positive integer L such
that, for all practical purposes, g(t) is zero whenever |t| > LTs, i.e.,
g(t) ≈0,
|t| > LTs.
(10.31)
In this case we have that, irrespective of t′ ∈R, only 2L + 1 terms (approximately)
determine X(t′). Indeed, if κ is an integer such that
κTs ≤t′ < (κ + 1)Ts,
(10.32)
then
X(t′) ≈A
κ+L

ℓ=max{1,κ−L}
Xℓg(t −ℓTs),
κTs ≤t′ < (κ + 1)Ts,
(10.33)
4Information-theoretic considerations suggest that this is a good approach.

Mapping Bits to Waveforms
where the sum is assumed to be zero if κ + L < 1.
Thus, if (10.31) holds, then the approximate calculation of X(t′) can be performed
without knowledge of the entire sequence X1, . . . , Xn and the modulator can start
producing the waveform X(·) as soon as it knows X1, . . . , XL.
10.12.2
Causality
The reader may object to the fact that, even if (10.31) holds, the signal X(·) may
be nonzero at negative times. It might therefore seem as though the transmitter
needs to transmit a signal before the system has been turned on and that, worse
still, this signal depends on the data bits that will be fed to the system in the
future when the system is turned on. But this is not really an issue. It all has
to do with how we deﬁne the epoch t = 0, i.e., to what physical time instant
does t = 0 correspond. We never said it corresponded to the instant when the
system was turned on and, in fact, there is no reason to set the time origin at
that time instant or at the “Big Bang.” For example, we can set the time origin
at LTs seconds-past-system-turn-on, and the problem disappears. Similarly, if the
transmitted waveform depends on X1, . . . , XL, and if these real numbers can only
be computed once the data bits D1, . . . , Dκ have been fed to the encoder, then it
would make sense to set the time origin to the moment at which the last of these κ
data bits has been fed to the encoder.
Some problems in Digital Communications that appear like tough causality prob-
lems end up being easily solved by time delays and the redeﬁnition of the time
origin. Others can be much harder. It is sometimes diﬃcult for the novice to de-
termine which causality problem is of the former type and which of the latter. As
a rule of thumb, you should be extra cautious when the system contains feedback
loops.
10.12.3
Digital Implementation
Even when all the symbols among X1, . . . , Xn that are relevant for the calculation
of X(t′) are known, the actual computation may be tricky, particularly if the
formula describing the pulse shape is diﬃcult to implement in hardware. In such
cases one may opt for a digital implementation using look-up tables. The idea is
to compute only samples of X(·) and to then interpolate using a digital-to-analog
(D/A) converter and an anti-aliasing ﬁlter. The samples must be computed at a
rate determined by the Sampling Theorem, i.e., at least once every 1/(2W) seconds,
where W is the bandwidth of the pulse shape.
The computation of the values of X(·) at its samples can be done by choosing L
suﬃciently large so that (10.31) holds and by then approximating the sum (10.30)
for t′ satisfying (10.32) by the sum (10.33). The samples of this latter sum can be
computed with a digital computer or—as is more common if the symbols take on a
ﬁnite (and small) number of values—using a pre-programmed look-up table. The
size of the look-up table thus depends on two parameters: the number of samples
one needs to compute every Ts seconds (determined via the bandwidth of g(·) and
the Sampling Theorem), and the number of addresses needed (as determined by L
and by the constellation size).

Chapter 11
Nyquist’s Criterion
11.1
Introduction
In Section 10.7 we discussed the beneﬁt of choosing the pulse shape φ in Pulse
Amplitude Modulation so that its time shifts by integer multiples of the baud
period Ts be orthonormal. We saw that if the real transmitted signal is given by
X(t) = A
n

ℓ=1
Xℓφ(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R,
where for all integers ℓ, ℓ′ ∈{1, . . . , n}
 ∞
−∞
φ(t −ℓTs) φ(t −ℓ′Ts) dt = I{ℓ= ℓ′},
then
Xℓ= 1

−∞
X(t) φ(t −ℓTs) dt,
ℓ= 1, . . . , n,
and all the inner products
 ∞
−∞
X(t) φ(t −ℓTs) dt,
ℓ= 1, . . . , n
can be computed using one circuit by feeding the signal X(·) to a matched ﬁlter of
impulse response ~φ and sampling the output at the times t = ℓTs, for ℓ= 1, . . . , n.
(In the complex case the matched ﬁlter is of impulse response ~φ∗.)
In this chapter we shall address the design of and the limitations on signals that are
orthogonal to their time shifts. While our focus so far has been on real functions φ,
for reasons that will become apparent in Chapter 16 when we discuss Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation, we prefer to generalize the discussion and allow φ to be
complex. The main results of this chapter are Corollary 11.3.4 and Corollary 11.3.5.
An obvious way of choosing a signal φ that is orthogonal to its time shifts by
nonzero integer multiples of Ts is by choosing a pulse that is zero outside some
interval of length Ts, say [−Ts/2, Ts/2).
This guarantees that the pulse and its
time shifts by nonzero integer multiples of Ts do not overlap in time and that they

Nyquist’s Criterion
are thus orthogonal.
But this choice limits us to pulses of inﬁnite bandwidth,
because no nonzero bandlimited signal can vanish outside a ﬁnite (time) interval
(Theorem 6.8.2).
Fortunately, as we shall see, there exist signals that are orthogonal to their time
shifts and that are also bandlimited.
This does not contradict Theorem 6.8.2
because these signals are not time-limited.
They are orthogonal to their time
shifts in spite of overlapping with them in time.
Since we have in mind using the pulse to send a very large number of symbols n
(where n corresponds to the number of symbols sent during the lifetime of the
system) we shall strengthen the orthonormality requirement to
 ∞
−∞
φ(t −ℓTs) φ∗(t −ℓ′Ts) dt = I{ℓ= ℓ′},
for all integers ℓ, ℓ′
(11.1)
and not only to those ℓ, ℓ′ in {1, . . . , n}.
We shall refer to Condition (11.1) as
saying that “the time shifts of φ by integer multiples of Ts are orthonormal.”
Condition (11.1) can also be phrased as a condition on φ’s self-similarity function,
which we introduce next.
11.2
The Self-Similarity Function of Energy-Limited Signals
We next introduce the self-similarity function of energy-limited signals. This
term is not standard; more common in the literature is the term “autocorrelation
function.” I prefer “self-similarity function,” which was proposed to me by Jim
Massey, because it reduces the risk of confusion with the autocovariance function
and the autocorrelation function of stochastic processes. There is nothing random
in our current setup.
Deﬁnition 11.2.1 (Self-Similarity Function). The self-similarity function Rvv
of an energy-limited signal v ∈L2 is deﬁned as the mapping
Rvv : τ 	→
 ∞
−∞
v(t + τ) v∗(t) dt,
τ ∈R.
(11.2)
If v is real, then the self-similarity function has a nice pictorial interpretation: one
plots the original signal and the result of shifting the signal by τ on the same graph,
and one then takes the pointwise product and integrates over time.
The main properties of the self-similarity function are summarized in the following
proposition.
Proposition 11.2.2 (Properties of the Self-Similarity Function). Let Rvv be the
self-similarity function of some energy-limited signal v ∈L2.

Proof. Part (i) follows by substituting τ = 0 in (11.2).
Part (ii) follows by noting that Rvv(τ) is the inner product between the mapping
t 	→v(t + τ) and the mapping t 	→v(t); by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (Theo-
rem 3.3.1); and by noting that both of the above mappings have the same energy,
namely, the energy of v:

Part (v) follows from the integral representation of Part (iv) and the integrability

With the above deﬁnition we can restate the orthonormality condition (11.1) in
terms of the self-similarity function Rφφ of φ:
Proposition 11.2.3 (Shift-Orthonormality and Self-Similarity). If φ is energy-
limited, then the shift-orthonormality condition
 ∞
−∞
φ(t −ℓTs) φ∗(t −ℓ′Ts) dt = I{ℓ= ℓ′},
ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z
(11.8)
is equivalent to the condition
Rφφ(ℓTs) = I{ℓ= 0},
ℓ∈Z.
(11.9)
Proof. The proposition follows by substituting s ≜t −ℓ′Ts in the LHS of (11.8)
to obtain

At this point, Proposition 11.2.3 does not seem particularly helpful because Con-
dition (11.9) is not easy to verify. But, as we shall see in the next section, this
condition can be phrased very elegantly in the frequency domain.

It will then follow that the condition that v is a Nyquist Pulse of parameter Ts is
equivalent to the condition that the function in (11.15) has Fourier Series Coeﬃ-
cients that are all zero except for the zeroth coeﬃcient, which is one. The theorem
will then follow by noting that a function is indistinguishable from a constant if,
and only if, all but its zeroth Fourier Series Coeﬃcient are zero. (This can be
proved by applying Theorem A.2.3 with g1 chosen as the constant function.) The
1There is no guarantee that the sum converges at every frequency f.
2Since, by hypothesis, g is integrable, it follows that the sum in (11.15) converges in the L1

Proof. By Proposition 11.2.3, Condition (11.17) can be equivalently expressed in
terms of the self-similarity function as
Rφφ(mTs) = I{m = 0},
m ∈Z.
(11.19)
The result now follows from the integral representation of the self-similarity func-
tion Rφφ (Proposition 11.2.2 (iv)) and from Theorem 11.3.2 (with the additional
simpliﬁcation that for every j ∈Z the function f 	→
ˆφ

f + j
Ts
2 is nonnegative, so
the sum on the LHS of (11.18) converges (possibly to +∞) for every f ∈R).
An extremely important consequence of Corollary 11.3.4 is the following corollary
about the minimum bandwidth of a pulse φ satisfying the orthonormality condition
(11.1).
Corollary 11.3.5 (Minimum Bandwidth of Shift-Orthonormal Pulses). Let Ts > 0
be ﬁxed, and let φ be an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz. If the
time shifts of φ by integer multiples of Ts are orthonormal, then
W ≥

Proof. Figure 11.2 illustrates why φ cannot satisfy (11.18) if (11.20) is violated.
The ﬁgure should also convince you of the conditions for equality in (11.20).
For the algebraically-inclined readers we prove the corollary by showing that if
W ≤1/(2Ts), then (11.18) can only be satisﬁed if φ satisﬁes (11.21) (outside a set
of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero).4 To see this, consider the sum

proof is that for frequencies in this open interval, if W ≤1/(2Ts), then all the terms
in the sum (11.23) are zero, except for the j = 0 term. That is,

(11.24)
4In the remainder of the proof we assume that ˆφ(f) is zero for frequencies f satisfying |f| > W.
The proof can be easily adjusted to account for the fact that, for frequencies |f| > W, it is possible
that ˆφ(·) be nonzero on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.

11.3 Nyquist’s Criterion
203
To convince yourself of (11.24), consider, for example, the term corresponding to
j = 1, namely, |ˆφ(f + 1/Ts)|2. By the deﬁnition of bandwidth, it is zero whenever
|f + 1/Ts| > W, i.e., whenever f > −1/Ts + W or f < −1/Ts −W. Since the
former category f > −1/Ts + W includes—by our assumption that W ≤1/(2Ts)—
all frequencies f > −1/(2Ts), we conclude that the term corresponding to j = 1
is zero for all the frequencies f in the open interval

−1
2Ts , + 1
2Ts

. More generally,
the j-th term |ˆφ(f + j/Ts)|2 is zero for all frequencies f satisfying the condition
|f +j/Ts| > W, a condition that is satisﬁed—assuming j ̸= 0 and W ≤1/(2Ts)—by
the frequencies in the open interval that is of interest to us

−1
2Ts , + 1
2Ts

.
For W ≤1/(2Ts) we thus obtain from (11.24) that the condition (11.18) implies
(11.21), and, in particular, that W = 1/(2Ts).
Functions satisfying (11.21) are seldom used in digital communication because they
typically decay like 1/t so that even if the transmitted symbols Xℓare bounded,
the signal X(t) may take on very high values (albeit quite rarely). Consequently,
the pulses φ that are used in practice have a larger bandwidth than 1/(2Ts).
This leads to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 11.3.6 (Excess Bandwidth). The excess bandwidth in percent of a
signal φ relative to Ts > 0 is deﬁned as
100%
	bandwidth of φ
1/(2Ts)
−1

.
(11.25)
The following corollary to Corollary 11.3.4 is useful for the understanding of real
signals of excess bandwidth smaller than 100%.
Corollary 11.3.7 (Band-Edge Symmetry). Let Ts be positive, and let φ be a real
energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, where W < 1/Ts so φ is of excess
bandwidth smaller than 100%. Then the time shifts of φ by integer multiples of Ts
are orthonormal if, and only if, f 	→|ˆφ(f)|2 satisﬁes the band-edge symmetry

(11.26)
Proof. We ﬁrst note that, since we have assumed that W < 1/Ts, only the terms
corresponding to j = −1, j = 0, and j = 1 contribute to the sum on the LHS of
(11.18) for f ∈


. Moreover, since φ is by hypothesis real, it follows
that |ˆφ(−f)| = |ˆφ(f)|, so the sum on the LHS of (11.18) is a symmetric function
of f. Thus, the sum is equal to Ts on the interval

if, and only if, it is

5Condition (11.26) should be understood to indicate that the LHS and RHS of (11.26) are
equal for all frequencies 0 ≤f ≤1/(2Ts) outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero. Again, we ignore
this issue in the proof and assume that ˆφ(f) is zero for all |f| > W.

Using (11.29) and using the band-edge symmetry criterion (Corollary 11.3.7), it
can be readily veriﬁed that the time shifts of φ by integer multiples of Ts are
orthonormal. Moreover, by (11.29), φ is bandlimited to (1 + β)/(2Ts) Hz. It is
thus of excess bandwidth β × 100%. For every 0 < β ≤1 we have thus found a
pulse φ of excess bandwidth β × 100% whose time shifts by integer multiples of Ts
are orthonormal.

The Self-Similarity Function of Integrable Signals
This section is a bit technical and can be omitted at ﬁrst reading. In it we deﬁne
the self-similarity function for integrable signals that are not necessarily energy-
limited, and we then compute the Fourier Transform of the so-deﬁned self-similarity
function.
Recall that a Lebesgue measurable complex signal v: R →C is integrable if
 ∞
−∞|v(t)| dt < ∞and that the class of integrable signal is denoted by L1. For
such signals there may be τ’s for which the integral in (11.2) is undeﬁned. For
example, if v is not energy-limited, then the integral in (11.2) will be inﬁnite at
τ = 0. Nevertheless, we can discuss the self-similarity function of such signals by
adopting the convolution representation of Proposition 11.2.2 (vi) as the deﬁnition.
We thus deﬁne the self-similarity function Rvv of an integrable signal v ∈L1 as
Rvv ≜v ⋆~v∗,
v ∈L1,
(11.33)
but we need some clariﬁcation. Since v is integrable, and since this implies that
its mirror image ~v is also integrable, it follows that the convolution in (11.33) is
a convolution between two integrable signals. As such, we are guaranteed by the
discussion leading to (5.9) that the integral
 ∞
−∞
v(σ)~v∗(τ −σ) dσ =
 ∞
−∞
v(t + τ) v∗(t) dt
is deﬁned for all τ’s outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero. (This set of Lebesgue
measure zero will include the point τ = 0 if v is not of ﬁnite energy.) For τ’s inside
this set of measure zero we deﬁne the self-similarity function to be zero. The value
zero is quite arbitrary because, irrespective of the value we choose for such τ’s, we
are guaranteed by (5.9) that the so-deﬁned self-similarity function Rvv is integrable

Chapter 12
Stochastic Processes: Deﬁnition
12.1
Introduction and Continuous-Time Heuristics
In this chapter we shall deﬁne stochastic processes. Our deﬁnition will be general so
as to include the continuous-time stochastic processes of the type we encountered
in Section 10.2 and also discrete-time processes.
In Section 10.2 we saw that since the data bits that we wish to communicate
are random, the transmitted waveform is a stochastic process.
But stochastic
processes play an important role in Digital Communications not only in modeling
the transmitted signals: they are also used to model the noise in the system and
other sources of impairments.
The stochastic processes we encountered in Section 10.2 are continuous-time pro-
cesses. We proposed that you think about such a process as a real-valued function
of two variables: “time” and “luck.” By “luck” we mean the realization of all the
random components of the system, e.g., the bits to be sent, the realization of the
noise processes (that we shall discuss later), or any other sources of randomness in
the system.
Somewhat more precisely, recall that a probability space is deﬁned as a triple
(Ω, F, P), where the set Ω is the set of experiment outcomes, the set F is the set
of events, and where P(·) assigns probabilities to the various events. A measurable
real-valued function of the outcome is a random variable, and a function of time and
the experiment outcome is a random process or a stochastic process. A continuous-
time stochastic process X is thus a mapping
X: Ω × R →R
(ω, t) 	→X(ω, t).
If we ﬁx some experiment outcome ω ∈Ω, then the random process can be regarded
as a function of one argument: time. This function is sometimes called a sample-
path, trajectory, sample-path realization, or a sample function
X(ω, ·): R →R
t 	→X(ω, t).

Similarly, if we ﬁx an epoch t ∈R and view the stochastic process as a function of
“luck” only, we obtain a random variable:
X(·, t): Ω →R
ω 	→X(ω, t).
This random variable is sometimes called the value of the process at time t or
the time-t sample of the process.

Deﬁnition 12.2.1 (Stochastic Process). A stochastic process

X(t), t ∈T

is an
indexed family of random variables that are deﬁned on a common probability space
(Ω, F, P). Here T denotes the indexing set and X(t) (or sometimes Xt) denotes
the random variable indexed by t.
Thus, X(t) is the random variable to which t ∈T is mapped. For each t ∈T
we have that X(t) is a random variable, i.e., a measurable mapping from the
experiment outcomes set Ω to the reals.1
A stochastic process

X(t), t ∈T

is said to be centered or of zero mean if all
the random variables in the family are of zero mean, i.e., if for every t ∈T we have
E[X(t)] = 0. It is said to be of ﬁnite variance if all the random variables in the
family are of ﬁnite variance, i.e., if E

X2(t)

< ∞for all t ∈T .
The case where the indexing set T comprises only one element is not particularly
exciting because in this case the stochastic process is just a random variable with
fancy packaging. Similarly, when T is ﬁnite, the SP is just a random vector or a
tuple of random variables in disguise. The cases that will be of most interest are
enumerated below.
(i) When the indexing set T is the set of integers Z, the stochastic process is
said to be a discrete-time stochastic process and in this case it is simply
a bi-inﬁnite sequence of random variables
. . . , X−2, X−1, X0, X1, X2, . . .
1Some authors, e.g., (Doob, 1990), allow for X(t) to take on the values ±∞provided that
at each t ∈T this occurs with zero probability, but we, following (Lo`eve, 1963), insist that X(t)
only take on ﬁnite values.

Stochastic Processes: Deﬁnition
For discrete-time stochastic processes it is customary to denote the random
variable to which ν ∈Z is mapped by Xν rather than X(ν) and to refer to
Xν as the time-ν sample of the process

Xν, ν ∈Z

.
(ii) When the indexing set is the set of positive integers N, the stochastic process
is said to be a one-sided discrete-time stochastic process and it is simply
a one-sided sequence of random variables
X1, X2, . . .
Again, we refer to Xν as the time-ν sample of

Xν, ν ∈N

.
(iii) When the indexing set T is the real line R, the stochastic process is said to
be a continuous-time stochastic process and the random variable X(t)
is the time-t sample of

X(t), t ∈R

.
In dealing with continuous-time stochastic processes we shall usually denote the
process by

X(t), t ∈R

, by X, by X(·), or by

X(t)

. The random variable to
which t is mapped, i.e., the time-t sample of the process will be denoted by X(t).
Its realization will be denoted by x(t), and the sample-path of the process by x or
x(·).
Discrete-time processes will typically be denoted by

Xν, ν ∈Z

or by

Xν

.
We shall need only a few results on discrete-time stochastic processes, and those will
be presented in Chapter 13. Continuous-time stochastic processes will be discussed
in Chapter 25.
12.3
Describing Stochastic Processes
The description of a continuous-time stochastic process in terms of a random vari-
able (as in Section 10.2), in terms of a ﬁnite number of random variables (as in
PAM signaling), or in terms of an inﬁnite sequence of random variables (as in the
transmission using PAM signaling of an inﬁnite binary data stream) is particularly
well suited for describing human-generated stochastic processes or stochastic pro-
cesses that are generated using a mechanism that we fully understand. We simply
describe how the stochastic process is synthesized from the random variables. The
method is less useful when the stochastic process denotes a random signal (such
as thermal noise or some other interference of unknown origin) that we observe
rather than generate. In this case we can use measurements and statistical meth-
ods to analyze the process. Often, the best we can hope for is to be informed
of the ﬁnite-dimensional distributions of the process, a concept that will be
introduced in Section 25.2.
12.4
Additional Reading
Classic references on stochastic processes to which we shall frequently refer are
(Doob, 1990) and (Lo`eve, 1963). We also recommend (Gikhman and Skorokhod,
1996), (Cram´er and Leadbetter, 2004), and (Grimmett and Stirzaker, 2001). For
discrete-time stochastic processes, see (Pourahmadi, 2001) and (Porat, 2008).

Introduction
This chapter discusses some of the properties of real discrete-time stochastic pro-
cesses. Extensions to complex discrete-time stochastic processes are discussed in
Chapter 17.
13.2
Stationary Processes
A discrete-time stochastic process is said to be stationary if all equal-length tuples
of consecutive samples have the same joint law. Thus:
Deﬁnition 13.2.1 (Stationary Discrete-Time Processes). A discrete-time SP

Xν

is said to be stationary or strict sense stationary or strongly stationary
if for every n ∈N and all integers η, η′ the joint distribution of the n-tuple
(Xη, . . . Xη+n−1) is identical to that of the n-tuple (Xη′, . . . , Xη′+n−1):

Xη, . . . Xη+n−1
 L=

Xη′, . . . Xη′+n−1

.
(13.1)
Here
L= denotes equality of distribution (law) so X
L= Y indicates that the random
variables X and Y have the same distribution; (X, Y )
L= (W, Z) indicates that the
pair (X, Y ) and the pair (W, Z) have the same joint distribution; and similarly for
n-tuples.
By considering the case where n = 1 we obtain that if

Xν

is stationary, then the
distribution of Xη is the same as the distribution of Xη′, for all η, η′ ∈Z. That
is, if

Xν

is stationary, then all the random variables in the family

Xν, ν ∈Z

have the same distribution: the random variable X1 has the same distribution as
the random variable X2, etc. Thus,

distribution of Xη, Xη+1 for any integer η. More, however, is true. If

Xν

is

of Xη+ν, Xη+ν′:


(Xν, Xν′)
L= (Xη+ν, Xη+ν′), ν, ν′, η ∈Z

. (13.3)
To prove (13.3) ﬁrst note that it suﬃces to treat the case where ν ≥ν′ because
(X, Y )
L= (W, Z) if, and only if, (Y, X)
L= (Z, W). Next note that stationarity
implies that

Xν′, . . . , Xν
 L=

Xη+ν′, . . . , Xη+ν

(13.4)
because both are (ν −ν′ + 1)-length tuples of consecutive samples of the process.
Finally, (13.4) implies that the joint distribution of (Xν′, Xν) is identical to the
joint distribution of (Xη+ν′, Xη+ν) and (13.3) follows.
The above argument can be generalized to more samples. This yields the following
proposition, which gives an alternative deﬁnition of stationarity, a deﬁnition that
more easily generalizes to continuous-time stochastic processes.
Proposition 13.2.2. A discrete-time SP

Xν, ν ∈Z

Proof. One direction is trivial and simply follows by substituting consecutive in-
tegers for ν1, . . . , νn in (13.5). The proof of the other direction is a straightforward
extension of the argument we used to prove (13.3).

Wide-Sense Stationary Stochastic Processes
Deﬁnition 13.3.1 (Wide-Sense Stationary Discrete-Time SP). We say that a
discrete-time SP

Xν, ν ∈Z

is wide-sense stationary (WSS) or weakly
stationary or covariance stationary or second-order stationary or weak-
sense stationary if the following three conditions are satisﬁed:
1This follows because the multivariate characteristic function determines the joint distribution
(see Proposition 23.4.4 or (Dudley, 2003, Chapter 9, Section 5, Theorem 9.5.1)) and because
the characteristic functions of all the linear combinations of the components of a random vector
determine the multivariate characteristic function of the random vector (Feller, 1971, Chapter XV,
Section 7).

Var[Xν] < ∞,

2) The random variables Xν, ν ∈Z, have identical means:
E[Xν] = E[X1] ,
ν ∈Z.
(13.7b)
3) The quantity E[Xν′Xν] depends on ν′ and ν only via ν −ν′:
E[Xν′Xν] = E[Xη+ν′Xη+ν] ,
ν, ν′, η ∈Z.
(13.7c)
Note 13.3.2. By considering (13.7c) when ν = ν′ we obtain that all the samples
of a WSS SP have identical second moments. And since, by (13.7b), they also all
have identical means, it follows that all the samples of a WSS SP have identical
variances:

Proof. The proof is left as an exercise. Alternatively, see the proof of Proposi-
tion 17.5.5.
13.4
Stationarity and Wide-Sense Stationarity
Comparing (13.9) with (13.6) we see that, for ﬁnite-variance stochastic processes,
stationarity implies wide-sense stationarity, which is the content of the following
proposition. This explains why stationary processes are sometimes called strong-
sense stationary and why wide-sense stationary processes are sometimes called
weak-sense stationary.
Proposition 13.4.1 (Finite-Variance Stationary Stochastic Processes Are WSS).
Every ﬁnite-variance discrete-time stationary SP is WSS.
Proof. While this is obvious from (13.9) and (13.6) we shall nevertheless give an
alternative proof because the proof of Proposition 13.3.3 was left as an exercise. The
proof is straightforward and follows directly from (13.2) and (13.3) by noting that if
X
L= Y , then E[X] = E[Y ] and that if (X, Y )
L= (W, Z), then E[XY ] = E[WZ].

Stationary Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes
It is not surprising that not every WSS process is stationary. Indeed, the deﬁnition
of WSS processes only involves means and covariances, so it cannot possibly say
everything regarding the distribution. For example, the process whose samples
are independent with the odd ones taking on the value ±1 equiprobably and with
the even ones uniformly distributed over the interval [−
√
3, +
√
3] is WSS but not
stationary.
13.5
The Autocovariance Function
Deﬁnition 13.5.1 (Autocovariance Function). The autocovariance function
KXX : Z →R of a WSS discrete-time SP

Xν

is deﬁned by
KXX(η) ≜Cov[Xν+η, Xν] ,
η ∈Z.
(13.10)
Thus, the autocovariance function at η is the covariance between two samples of
the process taken η units of time apart. Note that because

Xν

is WSS, the RHS
of (13.10) does not depend on ν. Also, for WSS processes all samples are of equal
mean (13.7b), so
KXX(η) = Cov[Xν+η, Xν]
= E[Xν+ηXν] −E[Xν+η] E[Xν]
= E[Xν+ηXν] −

E[X1]
2,
η ∈Z.
In some engineering texts the autocovariance function is called “autocorrelation
function.” We prefer the former because KXX(η) does not measure the correlation
coeﬃcient between Xν and Xν+η but rather the covariance. These concepts are
diﬀerent also for zero-mean processes. Following (Grimmett and Stirzaker, 2001)
we deﬁne the autocorrelation function of a WSS process of nonzero variance as
ρXX(η) ≜Cov[Xν+η, Xν]
Var[X1]
,
η ∈Z,
(13.11)
i.e., as the correlation coeﬃcient between Xν+η and Xν. (Recall that for a WSS
process all samples are of the same variance (13.8), so for such a process the
denominator in (13.11) is equal to

Var[Xν] Var[Xν+η].)
Not every function from the integers to the reals is the autocovariance function of
some WSS SP. For example, the autocovariance function must be symmetric in the
sense that
KXX(−η) = KXX(η),
η ∈Z,
(13.12)
because, by (13.10),
KXX(η) = Cov[Xν+η, Xν]
= Cov[X˜ν, X˜ν−η]
= Cov[X˜ν−η, X˜ν]
= KXX(−η),
η ∈Z,

where in the second equality we deﬁned ˜ν ≜ν + η, and where in the third equal-
ity we used the fact that for real random variables the covariance is symmetric:

It turns out that (13.12) and (13.13) fully characterize the autocovariance functions
of discrete-time WSS stochastic processes in a sense that is made precise in the
following theorem.
Theorem 13.5.2 (Characterizing Autocovariance Functions).
(i) If KXX is the autocovariance function of some discrete-time WSS SP


then KXX must satisfy (13.12) & (13.13) for every positive integer n.

then there exists a discrete-time WSS SP

whose autocovariance func-
tion KXX is given by KXX(η) = K(η) for all η ∈Z.
Proof. We have already proved Part (i). For a proof of Part (ii) see, for example,
(Doob, 1990, Chapter X, § 3, Theorem 3.1) or (Pourahmadi, 2001, Theorem 5.1 in
Section 5.1 and Section 9.7).2
2For the beneﬁt of readers who have already encountered Gaussian stochastic processes, we
mention here that if K(·) satisﬁes (13.14) & (13.15) then we can even ﬁnd a Gaussian SP whose
autocovariance function is equal to K(·).

Stationary Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes
A function K: Z →R satisfying (13.14) & (13.15) is called a positive deﬁnite
function. Such functions have been extensively studied in the literature, and in
Section 13.7 we shall give an alternative characterization of autocovariance func-
tions based on these studies. But ﬁrst we introduce the power spectral density.
13.6
The Power Spectral Density Function
Roughly speaking, the power spectral density (PSD) of a discrete-time WSS
SP (Xν) of autocovariance function KXX is the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
of the bi-inﬁnite sequence . . . , KXX(−1), KXX(0), KXX(1), . . . (Appendix B). More
precisely, it is an integrable function on the interval [−1/2, 1/2) whose (−η)-th
Fourier Series Coeﬃcient is equal to KXX(η). Such a function does not always
exist. When it does, it is unique in the sense that any two such functions can
only diﬀer on a subset of the interval [−1/2, 1/2) of Lebesgue measure zero. (This
follows because integrable functions on the interval [−1/2, 1/2) that have identical
Fourier Series Coeﬃcients can diﬀer only on a subset of [−1/2, 1/2) of Lebesgue
measure zero; see Theorem A.2.3.) Consequently, we shall speak of “the” PSD but
try to remember that this does not always exist and that, when it does, it is only
unique in this restricted sense.
Deﬁnition 13.6.1 (Power Spectral Density). We say that the discrete-time WSS
SP

Xν

is of power spectral density
SXX if
SXX is an integrable mapping
from the interval [−1/2, 1/2) to the reals such that
KXX(η) =
 1/2
−1/2
SXX(θ) ei2πηθ dθ,
η ∈Z.
(13.16)
But see also Note 13.6.5 ahead.
Note 13.6.2. We shall sometimes abuse notation and, rather than say that the
stochastic process

Xν, ν ∈Z

is of PSD SXX, we shall say that the autocovariance
function KXX is of PSD SXX.
By considering the special case of η = 0 in (13.16) we obtain that
Var[Xν] = KXX(0)
=
 1/2
−1/2
SXX(θ) dθ,
ν ∈Z.
(13.17)
The main result of the following proposition is that power spectral densities are
nonnegative (except possibly on a set of Lebesgue measure zero).
Proposition 13.6.3 (PSDs Are Nonnegative and Symmetric).
(i) If the WSS SP

Xν, ν ∈Z

of autocovariance KXX is of PSD SXX, then,
except on a subset of (−1/2, 1/2) of Lebesgue measure zero,
SXX(θ) ≥0
(13.18)
and
SXX(θ) = SXX(−θ).

13.6 The Power Spectral Density Function
225
(ii) If the function S: [−1/2, 1/2) →R is integrable, nonnegative, and symmetric
(in the sense that S(θ) = S(−θ) for all θ ∈(−1/2, 1/2)), then there exists a
WSS SP

Xν

whose PSD SXX is given by
SXX(θ) = S(θ),
θ ∈[−1/2, 1/2).
Proof. The nonnegativity of the PSD (13.18) will be established later in the more
general setting of complex stochastic processes (Proposition 17.5.7 ahead). Here we
only prove the symmetry (13.19) and establish the second half of the proposition.
That (13.19) holds (except on a set of Lebesgue measure zero) follows because KXX
is symmetric. Indeed, for any η ∈Z we have
 1/2
−1/2

SXX(θ) −SXX(−θ)

−1/2
SXX(˜θ) ei2π(−η)˜θ d˜θ
= KXX(η) −KXX(−η)
= 0,
η ∈Z,
(13.20)
so all the Fourier Series Coeﬃcients of the function θ 	→SXX(θ)−SXX(−θ) are zero,
thus establishing that this function is zero except on a set of Lebesgue measure
zero (Theorem A.2.3).
We next prove that if the function S: [−1/2, 1/2) →R is symmetric, nonnegative,
and integrable, then it is the PSD of some WSS real SP. We cheat a bit because
our proof relies on Theorem 13.5.2, which we never proved. From Theorem 13.5.2
it follows that it suﬃces to establish that the sequence K: Z →R deﬁned by
K(η) =
 1/2
−1/2
S(θ) ei2πηθ dθ,
η ∈Z
(13.21)
satisﬁes (13.14) & (13.15).
Verifying (13.14) is straightforward: by hypothesis, S(·) is symmetric so
K(−η) =
 1/2
−1/2
S(θ) ei2π(−η)θ dθ
=
 1/2
−1/2
S(−˜θ) ei2πη˜θ d˜θ
=
 1/2
−1/2
S(˜θ) ei2πη˜θ d˜θ
= K(η),
η ∈Z,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from (13.21); the second from the change of variable
˜θ ≜−θ; the third from the symmetry of S(·), which implies that S(−˜θ) = S(˜θ);
and the last equality again from (13.21).

Corollary 13.6.4. If a discrete-time WSS SP

Xν

has a PSD, then it also has a
PSD SXX for which (13.18) holds for every θ ∈[−1/2, 1/2) and for which (13.19)
holds for every θ ∈(−1/2, 1/2) (and not only outside a subset of Lebesgue measure
zero).
Proof. Suppose that


is of PSD SXX. Deﬁne the mapping S: [−1/2, 1/2) →R

(13.23)
By the proposition, SXX(·) and S(·) diﬀer only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero,
so they must have identical Fourier Series Coeﬃcients. Since the Fourier Series
Coeﬃcients of SXX agree with KXX, it follows that so must those of S(·). Thus, S(·)
is a PSD for

Xν

, and it is by (13.23) nonnegative on [−1/2, 1/2) and symmetric
on (−1/2, 1/2).
Note 13.6.5. In view of Corollary 13.6.4 we shall only say that

Xν

is of PSD SXX
if the function SXX—in addition to being integrable and to satisfying (13.16)—is
also nonnegative and symmetric.
As we have noted, not every WSS SP has a PSD. For example, the SP
Xν = X,
ν ∈Z,
where X is some zero-mean unit-variance RV has the all-one autocovariance func-
tion KXX(η) = 1, η ∈Z, and this all-one sequence cannot be the Fourier Series
Coeﬃcients sequence of an integrable function because, by the Riemann-Lebesgue

lemma (Theorem A.2.4), the Fourier Series Coeﬃcients of an integrable function
must converge to zero.4
In general, it is very diﬃcult to characterize the autocovariance functions having
a PSD. We know by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma that such autocovariance func-
tions must tend to zero, but this necessary condition is not suﬃcient. A very useful
suﬃcient (but not necessary) condition is the following:
Proposition 13.6.6 (PSD when KXX Is Absolutely Summable). If the autoco-
variance function KXX is absolutely summable, i.e.,
∞

η=−∞
KXX(η)
 < ∞,
(13.24)
then its Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
S(θ) =

(13.25)
is continuous, symmetric, nonnegative, and satisﬁes
 1/2
−1/2
S(θ) ei2πηθ dθ = KXX(η),
η ∈Z.
(13.26)
Consequently, S(·) is a PSD for KXX.
Proof. First note that because |KXX(η) e−i2πθη| = |KXX(η)|, it follows that (13.24)
guarantees that the sum in (13.25) converges uniformly and absolutely. And since
each term in the sum is a continuous function, the uniform convergence of the
sum guarantees that S(·) is continuous (Rudin, 1976, Chapter 7, Theorem 7.12).
Consequently,
 1/2
−1/2
|S(θ)| dθ < ∞,
(13.27)
and it is meaningful to discuss the Fourier Series Coeﬃcients of S(·).
We next prove that the Fourier Series Coeﬃcients of S(·) are equal to KXX, i.e.,
that (13.26) holds. This can be shown by swapping integration and summation
and using the orthonormality property

ei2π(η−η′)θ dθ = I{η = η′},

4One could say that the PSD of this process is Dirac’s Delta, but we shall refrain from doing
so because we do not use Dirac’s Delta in this book and because there is not much to be gained
from this. (There exist processes that do not have a PSD even if one allows for Dirac’s Deltas.)

It remains to show that S(·) is symmetric, i.e., that S(θ) = S(−θ), and that it is
nonnegative. The symmetry of S(·) follows directly from its deﬁnition (13.25) and
from the fact that KXX, like every autocovariance function, is symmetric (Theo-
rem 13.5.2 (i)).
We next prove that S(·) is nonnegative.
From (13.26) it follows that S(·) can
only be negative on a subset of the interval [−1/2, 1/2) of Lebesgue measure zero
(Proposition 13.6.3 (i)).
And since S(·) is continuous, this implies that S(·) is
nonnegative.
13.7
The Spectral Distribution Function
We next brieﬂy discuss the case where (Xν) does not necessarily have a power
spectral density function. We shall see that in this case too we can express the
autocovariance function as the Fourier Series of “something,” but this “something”
is not an integrable function. (It is, in fact, a measure.) The theorem will also
yield a characterization of positive deﬁnite functions. The proof, which is based on
Herglotz’s Theorem (Feller, 1971, Chapter XIX, Section 6, Theorem 2), (Pourah-
madi, 2001, Theorem 9.22), is omitted. The results of this section will not be used
in subsequent chapters.
Recall that a random variable taking values in the interval [−α, α] is said to be
symmetric (or to have a symmetric distribution) if Pr[X ≤−ξ] = Pr[X ≥ξ] for
all ξ ∈[−α, α].
Theorem 13.7.1. A function ρ: Z →R is the autocorrelation function of a real
WSS SP if, and only if, there exists a symmetric random variable Θ taking values
in the interval [−1/2, 1/2] such that
ρ(η) = E

ei2πηΘ

η ∈Z.
(13.29)
The cumulative distribution function of Θ is fully determined by ρ.
Proof. See (Doob, 1990, Chapter X, § 3, Theorem 3.2), (Pourahmadi, 2001, The-
orem 9.22), (Shiryaev, 1996, Chapter VI, § 1.1), or (Porat, 2008, Section 2.8).

This theorem also characterizes autocovariance functions: a function K: Z →R
is the autocovariance function of a real WSS SP if, and only if, there exists a
symmetric random variable Θ taking values in the interval [−1/2, 1/2] and some
constant α ≥0 such that
K(η) = α E

ei2πηΘ
,
η ∈Z.
(13.30)
(By equating (13.30) at η = 0 we obtain that α = K(0), i.e., the variance of the
stochastic process.)
Equivalently, we can state the theorem as follows. If

Xν

is a real WSS SP, then
its autocovariance function KXX can be expressed as
KXX(η) = Var[X1] E

η ∈Z
(13.31)
for some random variable Θ taking values in the interval [−1/2, 1/2] according to
some symmetric distribution. If, additionally, Var[X1] > 0, then the cumulative
distribution function FΘ(·) of Θ is uniquely determined by KXX.
Note 13.7.2.
(i) If the random variable Θ above has a symmetric density fΘ(·), then the
process is of PSD θ 	→Var[X1] fΘ(θ). Indeed, by (13.31) we have for every

Chapter 14
Energy and Power in PAM
14.1
Introduction
Energy is an important resource in Digital Communications. The rate at which
it is transmitted—the “transmit power”—is critical in battery-operated devices.
In satellite applications it is a major consideration in determining the size of the
required solar panels, and in wireless systems it inﬂuences the interference that one
system causes to another. In this chapter we shall discuss the power in PAM signals.
To deﬁne power we shall need some modeling trickery which will allow us to pretend
that the system has been operating since “time −∞” and that it will continue
to operate indeﬁnitely.
Our deﬁnitions and derivations will be mathematically
somewhat informal. A more formal account for readers with background in Measure
Theory is provided in Section 14.6.
Before discussing power we begin with a discussion of the expected energy in trans-
mitting a ﬁnite number of bits.
14.2
Energy in PAM
We begin with a seemingly completely artiﬁcial problem. Suppose that K inde-
pendent data bits D1, . . . , DK, each taking on the values 0 and 1 equiprobably,
are mapped by a mapping enc: {0, 1}K →RN to an N-tuple of real numbers
(X1, . . . , XN), where Xℓis the ℓ-th component of the N-tuple enc

D1, . . . , DK

.
Suppose further that the symbols X1, . . . , XN are then mapped to the waveform

N

ℓ=1
Xℓg(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R,
(14.1)
where g ∈L2 is an energy-limited real pulse shape, A ≥0 is a scaling factor, and
Ts > 0 is the baud period. We seek the expected energy in the waveform X(·).
We assume that X(·) corresponds to the voltage across a unit-load or to the current
through a unit-load, so the transmitted energy is the time integral of the mapping
t 	→X2(t).
Because the data bits are random variables, the signal X(·) is a

with integration and by the linearity of expectation; the sixth by swapping integra-
tion and summation; and the ﬁnal equality by the deﬁnition of the self-similarity

by

(In this case one need not even go through the calculation leading to (14.3); the

The second case for which the computation of E is simpliﬁed is when the distribu-
tion of D1, . . . , DK and the mapping enc(·) result in the real symbols X1, . . . , XN
being of zero mean and uncorrelated:2
E[Xℓ] = 0,

Deﬁning the Power in PAM
If

across a unit-load or the current through a unit-load, then it is reasonable to
deﬁne the power P in

 T

(14.14)
But there is a problem. Over its lifetime, a communication system is only used
to transmit a ﬁnite number of bits, and it only sends a ﬁnite amount of energy.
Consequently, if

X(t), t ∈R

corresponds to the transmitted waveform over the
system’s lifetime, then P as deﬁned in (14.14) will always end up being zero. The
deﬁnition in (14.14) is thus useless when discussing the transmission of a ﬁnite
number of bits.
To deﬁne power in a useful way we need some modeling trickery. Instead of thinking
about the encoder as producing a ﬁnite number of symbols, we should now pretend
that the encoder produces an inﬁnite sequence of symbols

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

, which are
then mapped to the inﬁnite sum
X(t) = A
∞

ℓ=−∞
Xℓg(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R.
(14.15)
For the waveform in (14.15), the deﬁnition of P in (14.14) makes perfect sense.
Philosophically speaking, the modeling trickery we employ corresponds to mea-
suring power on a time scale much greater than the signaling period Ts but much
shorter than the system’s lifetime.
But philosophy aside, there are still two problems we must address: how to model
the generation of the inﬁnite sequence

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

, and how to guarantee that
the sum in (14.15) converges for every t ∈R. We begin with the latter. If g is of
ﬁnite duration, then at every epoch t ∈R only a ﬁnite number of terms in (14.15)
are nonzero and convergence is thus guaranteed. But we do not want to restrict
ourselves to ﬁnite-duration pulse shapes because those, by Theorem 6.8.2, cannot
be bandlimited. Instead, to guarantee convergence, we shall assume throughout
that the following conditions both hold:
1) The symbols

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

are uniformly bounded in the sense that there
exists some constant γ such that
|Xℓ| ≤γ,
ℓ∈Z.

(14.17)
Using the fact that the sum 
n≥1 n−(1+α) converges whenever α > 0 (Rudin,
1976, Theorem 3.28), it is not diﬃcult to show that if both (14.16) and (14.17)
hold, then the inﬁnite sum (14.15) converges at every epoch t ∈R.
As to the generation of

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

, we shall consider three scenarios. In the
ﬁrst, which we analyze in Section 14.5.1, we ignore this issue and simply assume
that

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

is a WSS discrete-time SP of a given autocovariance function.
In the second scenario, which we analyze in Section 14.5.2, we tweak the block-
encoding mode that we introduced in Section 10.4 to account for a bi-inﬁnite data
sequence. We call this tweaked mode bi-inﬁnite block encoding and describe
it more precisely in Section 14.5.2. It is illustrated in Figure 14.1. Finally, the
third scenario, which we analyze in Section 14.5.3, is similar to the ﬁrst except
that we relax some of the statistical assumptions on

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

. But we only
treat the case where the time shifts of the pulse shape by integer multiples of Ts
are orthonormal.
Except in the third scenario, we shall only analyze the power in the stochastic
process (14.15) assuming that the symbols

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

are of zero mean
E[Xℓ] = 0,
ℓ∈Z.
(14.18)
This not only simpliﬁes the analysis but also makes engineering sense, because it
guarantees that

X(t), t ∈R

is centered
E[X(t)] = 0,
t ∈R,
(14.19)
and, for the reasons that we outline in Section 14.4, transmitting zero-mean wave-
forms is usually power eﬃcient.

power in t 	→X(t) −c(t).
14.4
On the Mean of Transmitted Waveforms
We next explain why the transmitted waveforms in digital communications are
usually designed to be of zero mean.3 We focus on the case where the transmitted
signal suﬀers only from an additive disturbance. The key observation is that given
any transmitter that transmits the SP

X(t), t ∈R

and any receiver, we can
design a new transmitter that transmits the waveform t 	→X(t) −c(t) and a
new receiver with identical performance.
Here c(·) is any deterministic signal.
Indeed, the new receiver can simply add c(·) to the received signal and then pass
on the result to the old receiver. That the old and the new systems have identical
performance follows by noting that if

N(t), t ∈R

is the added disturbance, then
the received signal on which the old receiver operates is given by t 	→X(t) + N(t).
And the received signal in the new system is t 	→X(t) −c(t) + N(t), so after we
add c(·) to this signal we obtain the signal X(t) + N(t), which is equal the signal
that the old receiver operated on. Thus, the performance of a system transmitting
X(·) can be mimicked on a system transmitting X(·) −c(·) by simply adding c(·)
at the receiver. See Figure 14.2.
The addition at the receiver of c(·) entails no change in the transmitted power.
Therefore, if a system transmits X(·), then we might be able to improve its power
eﬃciency without hurting its performance by cleverly choosing c(·) so that the
power in X(·) −c(·) be smaller than the power in X(·) and by then transmitting
t 	→X(t) −c(t) instead of t 	→X(t). The only additional change we would need
to make is to add c(·) at the receiver.
How should we choose c(·)? To answer this we shall need the following lemma.
3This, however, is not the case with some wireless systems that transmit training sequences
to help the receiver learn the channel and acquire timing information.

With the aid of Lemma 14.4.1 we can now choose c(·) to minimize the power in

study

and note that this expression is minimized over all choices of the waveform c(·) by
minimizing the integrand, i.e., by choosing at every epoch t the value of c(t) to be
the one that minimizes E
%
X(t) −c(t)
2&
. By Lemma 14.4.1 this corresponds to
choosing c(t) to be E[X(t)]. It is thus optimal to choose c(·) as
c(t) = E[X(t)] ,
t ∈R.
(14.22)
This choice results in the transmitted waveform being t 	→X(t) −E[X(t)], i.e., in
the transmitted waveform being of zero mean.
Stated diﬀerently, if in a given system the transmitted waveform is not of zero
mean, then a new system can be built that transmits a waveform of lower (or
equal) average power and whose performance on any additive noise channel is
identical.

of length Ts and in showing that this expected energy does not depend on τ, i.e.,
that the expected energy in all intervals of length Ts are identical. We calculate
the energy in the interval [τ, τ + Ts) as follows:

Note that, indeed, the RHS of (14.27) does not depend on the epoch τ at which
the length-Ts time interval starts. This observation will now help us to compute
the power in X(·). Since the interval [−T, +T) contains ⌊(2T)/Ts⌋disjoint intervals
of the form [τ, τ + Ts), and since it is contained in the union of ⌈(2T)/Ts⌉such
intervals, it follows that

14.5.2
Bi-Inﬁnite Block-Mode
The bi-inﬁnite block-mode with a (K, N) binary-to-reals block encoder
enc: {0, 1}K →RN
is depicted in Figure 14.1 and can be described as follows. A bi-inﬁnite sequence
of data bits

Dj, j ∈Z

is fed to an encoder. The encoder parses this sequence
into K-tuples and deﬁnes for every integer ν ∈Z the “ν-th data block” Dν
Dν ≜

DνK+1, . . . , DνK+K

,
ν ∈Z.
(14.34)
Each data block Dν is then mapped by enc(·) to a real N-tuple, which we denote
by Xν:
Xν ≜enc(Dν),
ν ∈Z.
(14.35)
The bi-inﬁnite sequence

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

produced by the encoder is the concatenation
of these N-tuples so

XνN+1, . . . , XνN+N

= Xν,
ν ∈Z.
(14.36)
Stated diﬀerently, for every ν ∈Z and η ∈{1, . . . , N}, the symbol XνN+η is the
η-th component of the N-tuple Xν. The transmitted signal X(·) is as in (14.15)
with the pulse shape g satisfying the decay condition (14.17) and with Ts > 0 being
arbitrary. (The boundedness condition (14.16) is always guaranteed in bi-inﬁnite
block encoding.)
We next compute the power P in X(·) under the assumption that the data bits

Dj, j ∈Z

are IID random bits, where we adopt the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 14.5.1 (IID Random Bits). We say that a collection of random variables
comprises IID random bits if the random variables are binary, independent, and
each of them takes on the values 0 and 1 equiprobably.
The assumption that the bi-inﬁnite data sequence

Dj, j ∈Z

consists of IID
random bits is equivalent to the assumption that the K-tuples

Dν, ν ∈Z

are
IID with Dν being uniformly distributed over the set of binary K-tuples {0, 1}K.
We shall also assume that the real N-tuple enc(D) is of zero mean whenever the
binary K-tuple is uniformly distributed over {0, 1}K. We will show that, subject to
these assumptions,

This expression has an interesting interpretation.
On the LHS is the power in
the transmitted signal in bi-inﬁnite block encoding using the (K, N) binary-to-reals
block encoder enc(·). On the RHS is the quantity E/(NTs), where E, as in (14.3), is
the expected energy in the signal that results when only the K-tuple (D1, . . . , DK)
is transmitted from time −∞to time +∞.
Using the deﬁnition of the energy
per-symbol Es (14.7) we can also rewrite (14.37) as in (14.8). Thus, in bi-inﬁnite

the signaling period Ts. Also, by (14.5), we can rewrite (14.37) as

u: (x1, . . . , xN, t) 	→

η=1
xη g(t −ηTs).
(14.40)
We now make three observations. The ﬁrst is that because the law of Dν does not
depend on ν, neither does the law of Xν (= enc(Dν)):
Xν
L= Xν′,
ν, ν′ ∈Z.
(14.41)
The second is that the assumption that enc(D) is of zero mean whenever D is
uniformly distributed over {0, 1}K implies by (14.40) that
E

u

Xν, t

(14.42)
The third is that the hypothesis that the data bits


are IID implies
that

Dν, ν ∈Z

are IID and hence that

Xν, ν ∈Z

are also IID. Consequently,
since the independence of Xν and Xν′ implies the independence of u

and

the integration variable to t′ ≜t −NTs; the sixth because the sum of the integrals

Note that, indeed, the RHS of (14.44) does not depend on the starting epoch τ of
the interval. Because there are ⌊2T/(NTs)⌋disjoint length-NTs half-open intervals
contained in the interval [−T, T) and because ⌈2T/(NTs)⌉such intervals suﬃce to
cover the interval [−T, T), it follows that

Time Shifts of Pulse Shape Are Orthonormal
We next consider the power in PAM when the time shifts of the real pulse shape by
integer multiples of Ts are orthonormal. To remind the reader of this assumption,
we change notation and denote the pulse shape by φ(·) and express the orthonor-
mality condition as

φ(t −ℓTs) φ(t −ℓ′Ts) dt = I{ℓ= ℓ′},

time shifts of the pulse shape are orthogonal over the interval (−∞, ∞); they need

not be orthogonal over the interval [−T, +T ] (even for very large T). Nevertheless,
intuition suggests that if ℓTs and ℓ′Ts are both much smaller than T, then the
orthogonality of t 	→φ(t −ℓTs) and t 	→φ(t −ℓ′Ts) over the interval (−∞, ∞)
should imply that they are nearly orthogonal over [−T, T ]. Making this intuition
rigorous is a bit tricky and the calculation of the energy in the interval [−T, T ]
requires a fair number of approximations that must be justiﬁed.
To control these approximations we shall assume a decay condition on the pulse
shape that is identical to (14.17). Thus, we shall assume that there exist positive
constants α and β such that
φ(t)
 ≤
β
1 + |t/Ts|1+α ,
t ∈R.
(14.46)
(The pulse shapes used in practice, like those we encountered in (11.31), typically
decay like 1/t2 so this is not a serious restriction.) We shall also continue to assume
the boundedness condition (14.16) but otherwise make no statistical assumptions

Proof. The proof is somewhat technical and may be skipped. Both sides of (14.48)
scale like A2, so it suﬃces to prove the theorem, as we shall, for A = 1. We next
argue that it suﬃces to prove the theorem for the case where Ts = 1. To see this,
assume that Ts > 0 is not necessarily equal to 1. Deﬁne the function

t ∈R
(14.51)
for some β, α > 0.
To further simplify notation we shall assume that T is a positive integer. Indeed,
if the limit is proved for positive integers, then the general result follows from the
Sandwich Theorem by noting that for T > 0 (not necessarily an integer)

We thus proceed to prove (14.48) for the case where A = 1, where Ts = 1, and
where the limit T →∞is only over positive integers. We begin by introducing
some notation. For every integer ℓwe denote the mapping t 	→φ(t −ℓ) by φℓ, and
for every positive integer T we denote the windowed mapping t 	→φ(t−ℓ) I{|t| ≤T}
by φℓ,w. Finally, we ﬁx some integer ν > 0 and deﬁne for every T > ν, the random

14.5 Computing the Power in PAM

We begin with (14.60), which follows directly from the Triangle Inequality,
∥X1∥2 ≤

T−ν<|ℓ|≤T+ν
|Xℓ| ∥φℓ,w∥2
≤4νγ,
where the second inequality follows from the boundedness condition (14.16), from
the fact that φℓ,w is a windowed version of the unit-energy signal φℓso ∥φℓ,w∥2 ≤
∥φ∥2 = 1, and because there are 4ν terms in the sum (whenever T exceeds ν).
We next prove (14.62). To that end we upper-bound |X2(t)| for |t| ≤T as follows:
|X2(t)| =

where the equality in the ﬁrst line follows from the deﬁnition of X2 (14.55) by
noting that for |t| ≤T we have φℓ(t) = φℓ,w(t); the inequality in the second line
follows from the boundedness condition (14.16) and from the Triangle Inequality for
Complex Numbers (2.12); the inequality in the third line from the decay condition
(14.51); the inequality in the fourth line because |ξ −ζ| ≥
|ξ| −|ζ|
 whenever
ξ, ζ ∈R; the inequality in the ﬁfth line because we are only considering |t| ≤T and
because over the range of this summation |ℓ| > T + ν; the equality in the sixth line
from the symmetry of the summand; the equality in the seventh line by deﬁning
˜ℓ≜ℓ−T; the inequality in the eighth line from the monotonicity of the function

A More Formal Account
In this section we present a more formal deﬁnition of power and justify some of
the mathematical steps that we took in deriving the power in PAM signals. This
section is quite mathematical and is recommended for readers who have had some
exposure to Measure Theory.

the probability space (Ω, F, P) is said to be a measurable stochastic process
if the mapping (ω, t) 	→X(ω, t) from Ω × R to R is measurable when its codomain
R is endowed with the σ-algebra R and when its domain Ω × R is endowed with
the product σ-algebra F × R (Deﬁnition 25.9.1 ahead). Thus,

X(t), t ∈R

is
measurable if the mapping (ω, t) 	→X(ω, t) is F×R/R measurable.5
From Fubini’s Theorem it follows that if

X(t), t ∈R

is measurable and if T > 0
is deterministic, then:
(i) For every ω ∈Ω, the mapping t 	→X2(ω, t) is Borel measurable;
(ii) the mapping

Proposition 14.6.2. If the pulse shape g is a Borel measurable function satisfying
the decay condition (14.17) for some positive α, β, Ts, and if the discrete-time SP


satisﬁes the boundedness condition (14.16) for some γ ≥0, then the
stochastic process
X: (ω, t) 	→A
∞

ℓ=−∞
Xℓ(ω) g(t −ℓTs)
(14.73)
is a measurable stochastic process.
Proof. The mapping (ω, t) 	→Xℓ(ω) is F×R/R measurable because Xℓis a ran-
dom variable, so the mapping ω 	→Xℓ(ω) is F/R measurable.
The mapping
(ω, t) 	→A g(t −ℓTs) is F×R/R measurable because g is Borel measurable, so
t 	→g(t −ℓTs) is R/R measurable. Since the product of measurable functions is
measurable (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 1, Section 1.9 (c)), it follows that the mapping
(ω, t) 	→AXℓ(ω) g(t −ℓTs) is F×R/R measurable. And since the sum of measur-
able functions is measurable (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 1, Section 1.9 (c)), it follows
that for every positive integer L ∈Z, the mapping

is F×R/R measurable. The proposition now follows by recalling that the pointwise
limit of every pointwise convergent sequence of measurable functions is measurable
(Rudin, 1987, Theorem 1.14).
Having established that the PAM signal (14.73) is a measurable stochastic process
we would next like to justify the calculations leading to (14.31). To justify the
swapping of integration and summations in (14.26) we shall need the following
lemma, which also explains why the sum in (14.27) converges.
Lemma 14.6.3. If g(·) is a Borel measurable function satisfying the decay condition
|g(t)| ≤
β
1 + |t/Ts|1+α ,
t ∈R
(14.74)
for some positive α, Ts, and β, then
∞

m=−∞
 ∞
−∞
g(t) g(t −mTs)
 dt < ∞.
(14.75)
Proof. The decay condition (14.74) guarantees that g is of ﬁnite energy. From the
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality it thus follows that the terms in (14.75) are all ﬁnite.
Also, by symmetry, the term in (14.75) corresponding to m is the same as the one
corresponding to −m. Consequently, to establish (14.75), it suﬃces to prove
∞

m=2

g(t) g(t −mTs)

(14.76)
Deﬁne the function
gu(t) ≜


if |t| ≤1,
|t|−1−α
otherwise,
t ∈R.
By (14.74) it follows that |g(t)| ≤β gu (t/Ts) for all t ∈R. Consequently,
 ∞
−∞
g(t) g(t −mTs)
 dt ≤β2
 ∞
−∞
gu(t/Ts) gu(t/Ts −m) dt
= β2Ts

and to establish (14.76) it thus suﬃces to prove

m=2
 ∞

(14.77)
Since the integrand in (14.77) is symmetric around τ = m/2, it follows that

gu(τ) gu(τ −m) dτ = 2

We can now state (14.31) as a theorem.
Theorem 14.6.4. Let the pulse shape g: R →R be a Borel measurable function sat-
isfying the decay condition (14.17) for some positive α, β, and Ts. Let

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

be a centered WSS SP of autocovariance function KXX and satisfying the bound-
edness condition (14.16) for some γ ≥0. Then the stochastic process (14.73) is
measurable and is of the power P given in (14.31).
Proof. The measurability of

X(t), t ∈R

follows from Proposition 14.6.2. The
power can be derived as in the derivation of (14.31) from (14.27) with the derivation
of (14.27) now being justiﬁable by noting that (14.25) follows from (14.71) and by
noting that (14.26) follows from Lemma 14.6.3 and Fubini’s Theorem.
Similarly, we can state (14.37) as a theorem.
Theorem 14.6.5 (Power in Bi-Inﬁnite Block-Mode PAM). Let

Dj, j ∈Z

be
IID random bits. Let the (K, N) binary-to-reals encoder enc: {0, 1}K →RN be

uniformly distributed over {0, 1}K. Let

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

Dj, j ∈Z

in bi-inﬁnite block encoding mode using enc(·). Assume that the pulse shape g is a
Borel measurable function satisfying the decay condition (14.17) for some positive
α, β, and Ts.
Then the stochastic process (14.73) is measurable and is of the
power P as given in (14.37).
Proof. Measurability follows from Proposition 14.6.2. The derivation of (14.37) is
justiﬁed using Fubini’s Theorem.

Exercise 14.9 (Binary Linear Encoders Producing Pairwise-Independent Symbols). Bi-
nary linear encoders with the antipodal mapping can be described as follows. Using a de-
terministic binary K×N matrix G, the encoder ﬁrst maps the row-vector d = (d1, . . . , dK)
to the row-vector dG, where dG is computed using matrix multiplication over the binary
ﬁeld. (Recall that in the binary ﬁeld multiplication is deﬁned as 0 · 0 = 0 · 1 = 1 · 0 = 0,
and 1 · 1 = 1; and addition is modulo 2, so 0 ⊕0 = 1 ⊕1 = 0 and 0 ⊕1 = 1 ⊕0 = 1).
Thus, the ℓ-th component cℓof dG is given by
cℓ= d1 · g(1,ℓ) ⊕d2 · g(2,ℓ) ⊕· · · ⊕dK · g(K,ℓ).

(i) Unless all the entries in the ℓ-th column of G are zero, E[Xℓ] = 0.
(ii) The statement “Xℓis independent of Xℓ′” is equivalent to the statement “the ℓ-th
and ℓ′-th columns of G diﬀer or are both all-zero.”
You may ﬁnd it useful to ﬁrst prove the following.
(i) If a RV E takes value in the set {0, 1}, and if F takes on the values 0 and 1 equiprob-
ably and independently of E, then E⊕F is uniform on {0, 1} and independent of E.
(ii) If X and Y are binary random variables and X is uniform, then they are indepen-
dent if, and only if, X ⊕Y is uniform.
Exercise 14.10 (Zero-Mean Signals for Linearly Dispersive Channels). Suppose that the
transmitted signal X suﬀers not only from an additive random disturbance but also
from a deterministic linear distortion. Thus, the received signal Y can be expressed as
Y = X ⋆h + N, where h is a known (deterministic) impulse response, and where N is
an unknown (random) additive disturbance. Show heuristically that transmitting signals
of nonzero mean is power ineﬃcient. How would you mimic the performance of a system
transmitting X(·) using a system transmitting X(·) −c(·)?

Chapter 15
Operational Power Spectral Density
15.1
Introduction
The Power Spectral Density of a stochastic process tells us more about the SP than
just its power. It tells us something about how this power is distributed among
the diﬀerent frequencies that the SP occupies. The purpose of this chapter is to
clarify this statement and to derive the PSD of PAM signals. Most of this chapter
is written informally with an emphasis on ideas and intuition as opposed to math-
ematical rigor. The mathematically-inclined readers will ﬁnd precise statements
of the key results of this chapter in Section 15.5. We emphasize that this chapter
only deals with real continuous-time stochastic processes.
The classical deﬁnition of the PSD of continuous-time stochastic processes (Deﬁni-
tion 25.7.2 ahead) is only applicable to wide-sense stationary stochastic processes,
and PAM signals are not WSS.1 Consequently, we shall have to introduce a new
concept, which we call the operational power spectral density, or the op-
erational PSD for short.2 This new concept is applicable to a large family of
stochastic processes that includes most WSS processes and most PAM signals.
For WSS stochastic processes, the operational PSD and the classical PSD coin-
cide (Section 25.14). In addition to being more general, the operational PSD is
more intuitive in that it clariﬁes the origin of the words “power spectral density.”
Moreover, it gives an operational meaning to the concept.
Section 15.2 provides some motivation for our deﬁnition of the operational PSD.
Readers in a rush to get to the deﬁnition can skip it and jump directly to Sec-
tion 15.3.
Section 15.4 derives the operational PSD of PAM signals, and Sec-
tion 15.5 does so a bit more rigorously. Sections 15.6–15.8 expand on the oper-
ational PSD. Section 15.6 explores its relationship to the average autocovariance
function; Section 15.7 discusses the eﬀect of ﬁltering on the operational PSD; and
Section 15.8 explores the technical assumptions that are required for the power to
equal the integral of the operational PSD over all the frequencies.
1If the discrete-time symbol sequence is stationary then the PAM signal is cyclostationary.
But this term will not be used in this book.
2These terms are not standard. Most of the literature does not seem to distinguish between
the PSD in the sense of Deﬁnition 25.7.2 and what we call the operational PSD.

Motivation
To motivate the new deﬁnition we shall ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss other “densities” such
as charge density, mass density, and probability density.
In electromagnetism one encounters the concept of charge density, which is often
denoted by ϱ(·). It measures the amount of charge per unit volume. Since the
charge need not be uniformly distributed, ϱ(·) is typically not constant so the charge
density is a function of location. Thus, we usually write ϱ(x, y, z) for the charge
density at the location (x, y, z). This can be deﬁned diﬀerentially or integrally.
The diﬀerential deﬁnition is
ϱ(x, y, z)
= lim
Δ↓0

(x′, y′, z′) : |x −x′| ≤Δ

and the integral deﬁnition is that a function ϱ(·) is the charge density if for every
region D ⊂R3
Charge in D =

(x,y,z)∈D
ϱ(x, y, z) dx dy dz,
D ⊂R3.
Ignoring some mathematical subtleties, the two deﬁnitions are equivalent. Perhaps
a more appropriate name for charge density is “Charge Spatial Density,” which
makes it clear that the quantity of interest is charge and that we are interested in
the way it is distributed in space. The units of ϱ(x, y, z) are those of charge per
unit volume.
Mass density—or as we would prefer to call it, “Mass Spatial Density”—is analo-
gously deﬁned. Either diﬀerentially, as
ϱ(x, y, z)

or integrally as the function ϱ(x, y, z) such that for every subset D ⊂R3
Mass in D =

(x,y,z)∈D
ϱ(x, y, z) dx dy dz,
D ⊂R3.
The units are those of mass per unit volume. Since mass is nonnegative, the dif-
ferential deﬁnition of mass density makes it clear that mass density must also be
nonnegative. This is slightly less apparent from the integral deﬁnition, but (exclud-
ing subsets of R3 of Lebesgue measure zero) is true nonetheless. By convention, if
one deﬁnes mass density integrally, then one typically insists that the density be
nonnegative.
Similarly, in discussing mass line density one envisions a one-dimensional object,
and its density with respect to unit length is deﬁned diﬀerentially as
ϱ(x) = lim

or integrally as the nonnegative function ϱ(·) such that for every subset D ⊂R of
the real line
Mass in D =

x∈D
ϱ(x) dx,
D ⊂R.
The units are those of mass per unit length.
In probability theory one encounters the probability density function of a random
variable X. Here the quantity of interest is probability, and we are interested in
how it is distributed on the real line. The units depend on the units of X. Thus, if
X measures the time in days until at least one piece in your new china set breaks,
then the units of the probability density function fX(·) of X are those of probability
(unit-less) per day. The probability density function can be deﬁned diﬀerentially
as
fX(x) = lim

or integrally by requiring that for every subset E ⊂R
Pr[X ∈E] =

x∈E
fX(x) dx,
E ⊂R.
(15.1)
Again, since probabilities are nonnegative, the diﬀerential deﬁnition makes it clear
that the probability density function is nonnegative. In the integral deﬁnition we
typically add the nonnegativity as a condition. That is, we say that fX(·) is a
density function for the random variable X if fX(·) is nonnegative and if (15.1)
holds. (There is a technical uniqueness issue that we are sweeping under the rug
here: if fX(·) is a probability density function for X and if ξ(·) is a nonnegative
function that diﬀers from fX(·) only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero, then ξ(·)
is also a probability density function for X.)
With these examples in mind, it is natural to interpret the power spectral density
of a stochastic process

among the diﬀerent frequencies. See Table 15.1 on Page 258. Heuristically, we
would deﬁne the power spectral density SXX at the frequency f diﬀerentially as

Δ
or integrally by requiring that for any subset D of the spectrum
Power of X in D =

f∈D
SXX(f) df,
D ⊂R.
(15.2)
To make this meaningful we next explain what we mean by “the power of X in
the frequencies D.” To that end it is best to envision a ﬁlter of impulse response h
whose frequency response ˆh is given by
ˆh(f) =

1
if f ∈D,
0
otherwise,
(15.3)
and to think of the power of X(·) in the frequencies D as the power at the output
of that ﬁlter when it is fed X(·), i.e., the power of the stochastic process X ⋆h.3
We are now almost ready to give a heuristic deﬁnition of the power spectral density.
But there are three more points we would like to discuss ﬁrst. The ﬁrst is that
(15.2) can also be rewritten as
Power of X in D =

all frequencies
I{f ∈D} SXX(f) df,
D ⊂R.
(15.4)
It turns out that if (15.2) holds for all sets D ⊂R of frequencies, then it also holds
for all “nice” ﬁlters (of a frequency response that is not necessarily {0, 1} valued):
Power of X ⋆h =

all frequencies
|ˆh(f)|2 SXX(f) df,
h “nice.”
(15.5)
That (15.4) typically implies (15.5) can be heuristically argued as follows.
By
(15.4) the set of frequency responses ˆh for which (15.5) holds includes all frequency
responses of the form ˆh(f) = I{f ∈D}. But if (15.5) holds for some frequency
response ˆh, then it must also hold for α ˆh, where α is any complex number, because
scaling the frequency response by α merely multiplies the output power by |α|2.
Also, if (15.5) holds for two responses ˆh1 and ˆh2 for which
ˆh1(f) ˆh2(f) = 0,
f ∈R,
(15.6)
then it must also hold for h1 + h2, because Parseval’s Theorem and (15.6) imply
that X ⋆h1 and X ⋆h2 must be orthogonal. Thus, (15.6) implies that the power
in X ⋆(h1 + h2) is the sum of the power in X ⋆h1 and the power in X ⋆h2. It
thus intuitively follows that if (15.4) holds for all subsets D of the spectrum, then
it holds for all step functions ˆh(f) = 
ν αν I{f ∈Dν}, where {Dν} are disjoint.
3We are ignoring the fact that the RHS of (15.3) is typically not the frequency response of a
stable ﬁlter. Stable ﬁlters have (uniformly) continuous frequency responses (Theorem 6.2.11 (i)).

.017
14:31:45, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

15.2 Motivation
261
And since any “nice” frequency response ˆh can be arbitrarily well approximated
by such step functions, we expect that (15.5) would hold for all “nice” responses.
Having heuristically established that (15.2) implies (15.5), we prefer to deﬁne the
PSD as a function SXX for which (15.5) holds, where “nice” will be taken to mean
stable.
The second point we would like to make is regarding uniqueness. For real stochastic
processes it is reasonable to require that (15.5) hold only for ﬁlters of real impulse
response. Thus we would require
Power of X ⋆h =

all frequencies
|ˆh(f)|2 SXX(f) df,
h real and “nice.”
(15.7a)
But since for ﬁlters of real impulse response the mapping f 	→|ˆh(f)|2 is symmetric,
(15.7a) can be rewritten as
 ∞
0
|ˆh(f)|2 
SXX(f) + SXX(−f)

df,
h real and “nice.”
(15.7b)
This form makes it clear that for real stochastic processes, (15.7a) (or its equivalent
form (15.7b)) can only specify the function f 	→SXX(f)+SXX(−f); it cannot fully
specify the mapping f 	→SXX(f).
For example, if a symmetric function SXX
satisﬁes (15.7a), then so does
f 	→

2 SXX(f)
if f > 0,
0
otherwise,
f ∈R.
In fact, if SXX satisﬁes (15.7a), then so does any function ˜S(·) such that
˜S(f) + ˜S(−f) = SXX(f) + SXX(−f),
f ∈R.
Thus, for the sake of uniqueness, we deﬁne the power spectral density SXX to be
a function of frequency that satisﬁes (15.7a) and that is additionally symmetric.
It can be shown that this deﬁnes SXX (to within indistinguishability) uniquely.
In fact, once one has identiﬁed a nonnegative function S(·) such that for any real
impulse response h the integral
 ∞
−∞
S(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df
corresponds to the power in X ⋆h, then the PSD SXX of X is given by the sym-
metrized version of S(·), i.e.,
SXX(f) = 1
2

S(f) + S(−f)

,
f ∈R.
(15.8)
Note that the diﬀerential deﬁnition of the PSD would not have resolved the unique-
ness issue because a ﬁlter of frequency response f 	→I

f ∈

f0 −Δ
2 , f0 + Δ


is
not real.
The ﬁnal point we would like to make is regarding additivity. Apart from some
mathematical details, what makes the deﬁnition of charge density possible is the

fact that the total charge in the union of two disjoint regions in space is the sum
of charges in the individual regions. The same holds for mass. For the probability
densities the crucial property is that the probability of the union of two disjoint
events is the sum of the probabilities. Consequently, if D1 and D2 are disjoint
subsets of R, then Pr[X ∈D1 ∪D2] = Pr[X ∈D1] + Pr[X ∈D2].
Does this
hold for power? In general the power in the sum of two signals is not the sum of
the individual powers. But if the signals are orthogonal, then their powers do add.
Thus, while Parseval’s theorem will not appear explicitly in our analysis of the PSD,
it is really what makes it all possible. It demonstrates that if D1, D2 ⊂R are disjoint
frequency bands, then the signals X ⋆h1 and X ⋆h2 that result when X is passed
through the ﬁlters of frequency response ˆh1(f) = I{f ∈D1} and ˆh2(f) = I{f ∈D2}
are orthogonal, so their powers add. We will not bother to formulate this result
precisely, because it does not show up in our analysis explicitly, but it is this result
that allows us to deﬁne the power spectral density.
15.3
Deﬁning the Operational PSD
Recall that in (14.14) we deﬁned the power P in a SP

Y (t), t ∈R

as
P = lim
T→∞
1
2T E
5 T
−T
Y 2(t) dt

whenever the limit exists. Thus, the power is the limit, as T tends to inﬁnity, of
the ratio of the expected energy in the interval [−T, T] to the interval’s duration 2T.
We deﬁne the operational power spectral density of a stochastic process as follows.
Deﬁnition 15.3.1 (Operational PSD of a Real SP). We say that the continuous-
time real stochastic process

X(t), t ∈R

is of operational power spectral
density SXX if

X(t), t ∈R

is a measurable SP; the mapping SXX : R →R is
integrable and symmetric; and for every stable real ﬁlter of impulse response h ∈L1
the power at the ﬁlter’s output when it is fed

X(t), t ∈R

is given by
Power in X ⋆h =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df.
(15.9)
We chose our words very carefully in the above deﬁnition, and, in doing so, we
avoided two issues. The ﬁrst is whether every SP is of some operational PSD. The
answer is “no.” (But most stochastic processes encountered in Digital Communi-
cations are.) The second issue we avoided is the uniqueness issue. Our wording
did not indicate whether a SP could be of two diﬀerent operational PSDs. It turns
out that if a SP is of two diﬀerent operational PSDs, then they must be indistin-
guishable in the sense that they are equal outside a set of frequencies of Lebesgue
measure zero. Consequently, somewhat loosely, we shall speak of the operational
power spectral density of

X(t), t ∈R

even though the uniqueness is only to
within indistinguishability. The uniqueness is established in Corollary 15.3.6 af-
ter we discuss nonnegativity, which is a consequence of the following somewhat
technical lemma.

Lemma 15.3.2.
(i) If s: R →R is an integrable function such that
 ∞
−∞
s(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df ≥0
(15.10)
for every integrable complex function h: R →C, then s(f) is nonnegative
at every frequency f outside a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero.
(ii) If s: R →R is a symmetric function (~s = s) such that (15.10) holds for
every integrable real function h: R →R, then s(f) is nonnegative at every
frequency f outside a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero.
Proof. We begin with a proof of Part (i). For every λ > 0 and f0 ∈R deﬁne the
function h: R →C by
h(t) =

(15.11)
This function is in both L1 and L2.
Since it is in L2, its self-similarity func-
tion Rhh(τ) is deﬁned at every τ ∈R. In fact,
Rhh(τ) =
	
1 −|τ|
λ

I{|τ| ≤λ} ei2πf0τ,
τ ∈R.
(15.12)
And since h ∈L1, it follows from (11.35) that the Fourier Transform of Rhh is the
mapping f 	→|ˆh(f)|2. Consequently, by Proposition 6.2.3 (i) (with the substitution
of ~Rhh for g), the mapping f 	→|ˆh(f)|2 can be expressed as the Inverse Fourier
Transform of ~Rhh. Thus, by (6.8) (with the substitutions of s for x and ~Rhh for g),
 ∞
−∞
s(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df =
 ∞
−∞
ˆs(f) ~R∗

It now follows from (15.10), (15.13), and (15.12) that

Part (i) now follows from (15.14) and from Theorem 6.2.12 (ii) (with the substitu-
tion of s for x and of f0 for t).
We next turn to Part (ii). For any integrable complex function h: R →C, deﬁne
hR ≜Re(h) and hI ≜Im(h) so

metric. Since we have established (15.16) for every complex h: R →C, we can
now apply Part (i) to conclude that s(f) is nonnegative at all frequencies f outside
a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
Going back to the deﬁnition of the operational PSD and speciﬁcally to (15.9),
and noting that the power in X ⋆h is nonnegative, we conclude that if X is of
operational PSD SXX, then SXX is symmetric and satisﬁes

operational PSD SXX, then SXX(f) must be nonnegative at all frequencies f outside
a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero.

15.3 Deﬁning the Operational PSD
265
It follows from the corollary that if

X(t)

is of operational PSD SXX then the
function
S(f) =

SXX(f)
if SXX(f) ≥0,
0
otherwise
(which results when we change the values of SXX to zero at those frequencies where
it is negative) is indistinguishable from SXX. Consequently, (15.9) must also hold
when we replace SXX with S. Thus,

X(t)

is also of operational PSD S, which
is nonnegative at all frequencies.
Consequently, there is no harm in adding to
Deﬁnition 15.3.1 the requirement that SXX be a nonnegative function:
Remark 15.3.4. Henceforth we require from every operational PSD that it be
nonnegative.
Next, as promised, we address the uniqueness of the operational PSD. For that
we will need the following lemma, which is similar to Lemma 15.3.2 but with the
greater-or-equal sign in (15.10) replaced with equality.
Lemma 15.3.5.
(i) If s: R →R is an integrable function such that
 ∞
−∞
s(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df = 0
(15.18)
for every integrable complex function h: R →C, then s(f) is zero at all
frequencies f outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
(ii) If s: R →R is a symmetric function (~s = s) such that (15.18) holds for
every integrable real function h: R →R, then s(f) is zero at all frequencies
f outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
Proof. The equality sign in (15.18) implies that if s satisﬁes the hypotheses of the
lemma then both s and −s satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 15.3.2. Consequently,
by the latter lemma, s as well as −s is nonnegative outside an exception set of
frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero. Outside the union of their respective excep-
tion sets—a union which is also of Lebesgue measure zero (Exercise 2.11)—both s
and −s are nonnegative, and s must therefore be zero.
Corollary 15.3.6 (Uniqueness of the Operational PSD). If both SXX and S′
XX are
operational PSDs of some SP, then the set of frequencies at which they diﬀer is of
Lebesgue measure zero.
Proof. Apply Lemma 15.3.5 (ii) to the function s: f 	→SXX(f) −S′
XX(f).
As noted above, we make here no general claims about the existence of opera-
tional PSDs. Under certain restrictions that are made precise in Section 15.5, the
operational PSD is deﬁned for PAM signals. And by Proposition 25.7.1 and The-
orem 25.14.1, the operational PSD always exists for measurable, centered, WSS
stochastic processes of continuous and integrable autocovariance functions.

15.4
The Operational PSD of Real PAM Signals
Computing the operational PSD of PAM signals is much easier than one might
expect. This is because, as we next show, passing a PAM signal of pulse shape g
through a stable ﬁlter of impulse response h is tantamount to changing its pulse
shape from g to g ⋆h:

σ 	→A

ℓ
Xℓg(σ −ℓTs)

⋆h

(t) = A

ℓ
Xℓ(g ⋆h)(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R. (15.19)
(For a formal statement of this result, see Corollary 18.6.2, which also addresses the
diﬃculty that arises when the sum is inﬁnite.) Consequently, if one can compute
the power in a PAM signal of arbitrary pulse shape (as explained in Chapter 14),
then one can also compute the power in a ﬁltered PAM signal.
That ﬁltering a PAM signal is tantamount to convolving its pulse shape with the
impulse response follows from two properties of the convolution: that it is linear
(α u + β v) ⋆h = α u ⋆h + β v ⋆h
and that convolving a delayed version of a signal with h is equivalent to convolving
the original signal and delaying the result

We are now ready to apply the results of Chapter 14 on the power in PAM signals
to study the power in ﬁltered PAM signals and hence to derive the operational
PSD of PAM signals. We will not treat the case discussed in Section 14.5.3 where
the only assumption is that the time shifts of the pulse shape by integer multiples
of Ts are orthonormal, because this orthonormality is typically lost under ﬁltering.

The Symbols Are Centered, Uncorrelated, and of Equal
Variance
We begin with the case where the symbols

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

are of zero mean, uncor-
related, and of equal variance σ2
X. As in (15.20) we denote the PAM signal by

X(t), t ∈R

and study its operational PSD by studying the power in X ⋆h.
Using (15.21) we obtain that X⋆h is the PAM signal X but with the pulse shape g
replaced by g ⋆h. Consequently, using Expression (14.33) for the power in PAM
with zero-mean, uncorrelated, variance-σ2
X symbols, we obtain that the power in
X ⋆h is given by

where the ﬁrst equality follows from (14.33) applied to the PAM signal of pulse
shape g⋆h; the second follows from Parseval’s Theorem by noting that the Fourier
Transform of a convolution of two signals is the product of their Fourier Transforms;
and where the third equality follows by rearranging terms. From (15.22) and from
the fact that f 	→|ˆg(f)|2 is a symmetric function (because g is real), it follows
that the operational PSD of the PAM signal

X(t), t ∈R

when



Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

are not necessarily un-
correlated but form a centered, WSS, discrete-time SP can be treated with the
same ease via (14.31) or (14.32). As above, passing X through a ﬁlter of impulse
response h results in a PAM signal with identical symbols but with pulse shape
g ⋆h. Consequently, the resulting power can be computed by substituting g ⋆h
for g in (14.32) to obtain that the power in X ⋆h is given by

m=−∞
KXX(m) ei2πfmTs |ˆg(f)|2,

This symmetry follows from the symmetry of |ˆg(·)| (because the pulse shape g
is real) and from the symmetry of the autocovariance function KXX (because the
symbols

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

are real; see (13.12)). Note that (15.24) reduces to (15.23) if
KXX(m) = σ2
X I{m = 0}.
15.4.3
The Operational PSD in Bi-Inﬁnite Block-Mode
We now assume, as in Section 14.5.2, that the (K, N) binary-to-reals block encoder
enc: {0, 1}K →RN is used in bi-inﬁnite block encoding mode to map the bi-
inﬁnite IID random bits

Dj, j ∈Z

to the bi-inﬁnite sequence of real numbers

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

, and that the transmitted signal is
X(t) = A
∞

ℓ=−∞
Xℓg(t −ℓTs),
(15.25)
where Ts > 0 is the baud period, and where g(·) is a pulse shape satisfying the
decay condition (14.17). We do not assume that the time shifts of g(·) by integer
multiples of Ts are orthogonal, or that the symbols

Xℓ, ℓ∈Z

are uncorrelated.
We do, however, continue to assume that the N-tuple enc(D1, . . . , DK) is of zero
mean whenever D1, . . . , DK are IID random bits.
We shall determine the operational PSD of X by computing the power of the signal
that results when X is fed to a stable ﬁlter of impulse response h. As before, we note
that feeding X through a ﬁlter of impulse response h is tantamount to replacing
its pulse shape g by g ⋆h. The power of this output signal can be thus computed
from our expression for the power in bi-inﬁnite block encoding with PAM signaling
(14.38) but with the pulse shape being g ⋆h and hence of FT f 	→ˆg(f) ˆh(f):

Theorem 15.4.1 (The Bandwidth of PAM Is that of the Pulse Shape). Suppose
that the operational PSD in bi-inﬁnite block-mode of a PAM signal


is equal to the bandwidth of the pulse shape g.
Proof. The proof is very similar to the proof of Lemma 10.10.1. If g is bandlimited
to W Hz, then so is

X(t)

, because, by (15.26),

ˆg(f) = 0

SXX(f) = 0

We next complete the proof by showing that there are at most a countable number
of frequencies f such that SXX(f) = 0 but ˆg(f) ̸= 0.
From (15.26) it follows
that to show this it suﬃces to show that there are at most a countable number of
frequencies f such that σ(f) = 0, where

(15.30)
From (15.29) and (15.27) it follows that γ0 > 0, so the polynomial in (15.30) is
not zero. Consequently, since its degree is at most 2N −2, it has at most 2N −2
distinct roots and, a fortiori, at most 2N −2 distinct roots of unit magnitude.
Denote these roots by
eiθ1, . . . , eiθd,
where d ≤2N −2 and θ1, . . . , θd ∈[−π, π). Since f satisﬁes ei2πfTs = eiθ if, and
only if,

15.5
A More Formal Account
In this section we shall give a more formal account of the power at the output of
a stable ﬁlter that is fed a PAM signal. There are two approaches to this. The
ﬁrst is based on carefully justifying the steps in our informal derivation.4
This
approach is pursued in Section 18.6.5, where the results are generalized to complex
pulse shapes and complex symbols. The second approach is to convert the problem
into one about WSS stochastic processes and to then rely heavily on Sections 25.13
and 25.14 on the ﬁltering of WSS stochastic processes and, in particular, on the
Wiener-Khinchin Theorem (Theorem 25.14.1). For the beneﬁt of readers who have
already encountered the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem we follow this latter approach
here. We ask the readers to note that the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem is not directly
applicable here because the PAM signal is not WSS. A “stationarization argument”
is thus needed.
The key results of this section are the following two theorems.
Theorem 15.5.1. Consider the setup of Theorem 14.6.4 with the additional as-
sumption that the autocovariance function KXX of

Operational Power Spectral Density
Part (ii) is a consequence of the fact that the convolution of a bounded function
with an integrable function is deﬁned at every epoch; see Section 5.5.
We next turn to Part (iii). The proof of the measurability of the convolution of

X(t), t ∈R

with h is a bit technical. It is very similar to the proof of Theo-
rem 25.13.2 (i). As in that proof, we ﬁrst note that it suﬃces to prove the result
for functions h that are Borel measurable; the extension to Lebesgue measurable
functions will then follow by approximating h by a Borel measurable function
that diﬀers from it on a set of Lebesgue measure zero (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 8,
Lemma 1 or Chapter 2, Exercise 14) and by then noting that the convolution of
t 	→X(ω, t) with h is unaltered when h is replaced by a function that diﬀers from
it on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. We thus assume that h is Borel measur-
able. Consequently, the mapping from R2 to R deﬁned by (t, σ) 	→h(t −σ) is also
Borel measurable, because it is the composition of the continuous (and hence Borel
measurable) mapping (t, σ) 	→t −σ with the Borel measurable mapping t 	→h(t).
As in the proof of Theorem 25.13.2, we prove the measurability of the convolution
of

X(t), t ∈R

with h by proving the measurability of the mapping deﬁned by
(ω, t) 	→(1 + t2)−1  ∞
−∞X(ω, σ) h(t −σ) dσ. To this end we study the function

(ω, t), σ

	→X(ω, σ) h(t −σ)
1 + t2
,

(ω, t) ∈Ω × R, σ ∈R

.
(15.38)
This function is measurable because, as noted above, (t, σ) 	→h(t −σ) is measur-
able; because, by Proposition 14.6.2,

X(t), t ∈R

is measurable; and because the
product of Borel measurable functions is Borel measurable (Rudin, 1987, Chap-
ter 1, Section 1.9 (c)). Moreover, using (15.33) and Fubini’s Theorem it can be
readily veriﬁed that this function is integrable. Using Fubini’s Theorem again, we
conclude that the function
(ω, t) 	→
1
1 + t2
 ∞
−∞
X(ω, σ) h(t −σ) dσ
is measurable. Consequently, so is X ⋆h.
To conclude the proof we now need to compute the power in the measurable (non-
stationary) SP X ⋆h. This will be done in a roundabout way. We shall ﬁrst deﬁne
a new SP X′. This SP is centered, measurable, and WSS so the power in X′⋆h can
be computed using Theorem 25.14.1. We shall then show that the powers of X ⋆h
and X′ ⋆h are equal and hence that from the power in X′ ⋆h we can immediately
obtain the power in X ⋆h.
We begin by deﬁning the SP

X′(t), t ∈R


Operational PSD and Average Autocovariance Function
The operational PSD can often be calculated from the average autocovariance
function, which we deﬁne and study next. The main result is Theorem 15.6.6,
which provides an operational meaning to the average autocovariance function and
which relates it to the operational PSD. Its proof is somewhat technical and is
recommended for the more advanced readers. Those should read Chapter 25 ﬁrst.
Throughout this section we restrict ourselves to measurable stochastic processes
that are centered and of bounded variance, where a SP

X(t)

is said to be of
bounded variance if there exists some constant γ such that at every epoch t ∈R
the variance of the RV X(t) is bounded by γ:
Var[X(t)] ≤γ,
t ∈R.
(15.48)
From the Covariance Inequality (Corollary 3.5.2)

obtain:
Note 15.6.2 (The Power and the Average Autocovariance Function). If

X(t)

is a centered SP of power P and of average autocovariance function ¯KXX, then
P = ¯KXX(0).

for every length-Ts interval, we can establish (15.55) using the same argument we
employed in Section 14.5.1 when we computed the power in PAM; see (14.28)–
(14.30).
The main result of this section is that if ¯KXX is integrable, then its FT is the
operational PSD of

X(t)

. This shows that, when

X(t)

has an integrable average
autocovariance function, our deﬁnition of the operational PSD and the deﬁnition in
the literature of the operational PSD as the FT of ¯KXX (Yaglom, 1986, Chapter 4,
Section 26.6) coincide. It also provides a method for computing the operational
PSD: compute ¯KXX and take its FT. In the above example, this allows us to recover
the operational PSD of (15.23) by taking the FT of the RHS of (15.55).
To prove this result we shall need a technical lemma and a proposition describing
the key properties of the average autocovariance function. Readers who intend to
skip the theorem’s proof can also skip these results and proceed directly to the
theorem.
The lemma deals with the integration interval in the deﬁnition of ¯KXX (15.51).
The integral in (15.51) is over the interval [−T, T ], which is symmetric around the
origin. The lemma shows that a constant oﬀset (that does not depend on T) in the
range of integration does not alter the limit:
Lemma 15.6.4. If the SP

(15.58)
Proof. Since

X(t)

is of average autocovariance function ¯KXX, it is a fortiori of
bounded variance, and there exists some constant γ for which (15.48) holds. It
thus follows from (15.50) that
Cov

In the next proposition we shall need the concept of a positive deﬁnite function,
which is discussed in Appendix C.
Proposition 15.6.5 (Properties of ¯KXX). If the SP

X(t)

is of average autoco-
variance function ¯KXX, then ¯KXX is a measurable, real, positive deﬁnite function.
Consequently

(15.62)
for every n ∈N, epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, and real coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn ∈R.
Proof. The measurability of ¯KXX follows (using Fubini’s Theorem) from the mea-
surability of the SP

X(t)

and from the fact that the limit of measurable functions
is measurable. The details are omitted.
We shall next establish (15.61) and that (15.62) holds for every n ∈N, epochs
t1, . . . , tn ∈R, and real coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn ∈R. From this it will then follow
that ¯KXX is positive deﬁnite using Proposition C.2. Proposition C.3 (iii) will then
establish (15.60).

The key parts of the next theorem are Part (i), which provides an operational
meaning to the average autocovariance function and Part (iii) that relates it to the
operational PSD; the other parts are technical.
Theorem 15.6.6 (The Operational PSD and Average Autocovariance Function).

(15.64)
(iii) If ¯KXX is integrable, then its FT is the operational PSD of

:
ˆ¯KXX = SXX.
(15.65)
(iv) If

X(t)

is of operational PSD SXX, then, outside a set of Lebesgue measure
zero, ¯KXX equals the IFT of SXX.
Proof. Since

bounded variance, and there exists some constant γ for which (15.48) holds. It
thus follows from (15.50) and the fact that

We now turn to Part (i). Let h ∈L1 be any stable impulse response. To compute
the power in X⋆h we use Fubini’s Theorem to express the expectation of (X⋆h)2(t)
at every epoch t ∈R as

replacing α there with τ, and τ there with τ −σ). From here the proof of (15.63)

Proposition 6.2.4 and the fact that ˆRhh is real, and the last equality holds because
the FT of Rhh is f 	→
ˆh(f)
2; see (11.35).
We next turn to Part (iii). Since ¯KXX is real and symmetric, its FT ˆ¯KXX is real and
symmetric. And since it is positive deﬁnite, its FT is nonnegative (Appendix C,
Corollary C.8 (ii)). To prove that ˆ¯KXX equals SXX it thus remains to establish
that

(15.69)
This follows from Part (ii) because ¯KXX is indistinguishable from the IFT of ˆ¯KXX
(Appendix C, Corollary C.8 (i)).
We next prove Part (iv). For every h ∈L1 we can express the power in X ⋆h
either in terms of SXX (using the deﬁnition of the operational PSD) or in terms of
the average autocovariance function ¯KXX (15.63), so

(15.70)
where the second equality follows from Proposition 6.2.4.
Since ¯KXX is a measurable positive deﬁnite function (Proposition 15.6.5), it follows
from the Riesz-Crum Theorem (Appendix C, Theorem C.6 (i)), that it can be
expressed as
¯KXX = ¯K

(15.71)
where ¯K
c
XX is a positive deﬁnite function that is continuous, and ¯K
s
XX is a positive
deﬁnite function that is zero outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero. It follows
from (15.70), (15.71), and from the fact that ¯K

XX is indistinguishable from the

Since both ¯K

XX and ˇSXX are continuous, this implies that they are identical
(Lemma 25.14.2). Thus, the IFT of SXX is identical to ¯K
c
XX, and the latter is
indistinguishable from ¯KXX (because ¯K
s
XX is indistinguishable from the all-zero
function), so the IFT of SXX must be indistinguishable from ¯KXX.

15.7
The Operational PSD of a Filtered Stochastic Process
From the operational PSD of a SP X it should not be diﬃcult to compute the
operational PSD of X ⋆r whenever r is deterministic. The intuition is as follows.
To compute the operational PSD of the SP X ⋆r we need to know the power in
(X ⋆r) ⋆h for every h ∈L1. But, since convolution is (usually) associative, we
expect that the SP (X⋆r)⋆h be (usually) identical to the SP X⋆(r⋆h) and hence
of the same power. The power in the latter is easily computed from SXX: we view
r ⋆h as an impulse response of a ﬁlter; we view X ⋆(r ⋆h) as the result of passing
X through this ﬁlter; and we recall that X is of operational PSD SXX so the power
in X ⋆(r ⋆h)—and hence also in (X ⋆r) ⋆h—is
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f)
ˆr(f) ˆh(f)
2 df.
Rewriting this as
 ∞
−∞

SXX(f)
ˆr(f)
2 ˆh(f)
2 df,
we conclude that the operational PSD of X ⋆r ought to be
f 	→SXX(f)
ˆr(f)
2.
As we next show, under some very mild technical conditions, this is indeed the case.
The technical assumptions are needed to justify the claim that the convolution is
associative. This is the content of the next lemma. The proof is rather technical
and can be skipped.
Lemma 15.7.1 (Convolution Is Associative: Stochastic Processes). Let

X(t)

be a measurable SP satisfying
sup
t∈R
E

|X(t)|

< ∞.
(15.73)
Let r and h be real integrable signals, and let the epoch t ∈R be arbitrary but ﬁxed.
Then, with probability one, the two integrals

and
 ∞
−∞

X ⋆r

(15.74)
are both deﬁned and are equal.
Note 15.7.2. Condition (15.73) holds whenever

X(t)

is centered and of bounded
variance, because the nonnegativity of the variance of |X(t)| implies that E[|X(t)|]
is upper-bounded by the square root of E

X2(t)

.
Proof. Since

X(t)

is a measurable SP, and since both r and h are measurable,

(15.78)
The LHS of the above is the integral on the LHS of (15.74), and the RHS is the
integral on the RHS of (15.74).
Having established the associativity of the convolution, we are now ready for the
main result on the operational PSD of ﬁltered stochastic processes.
Theorem 15.7.3 (The Operational PSD of a Filtered SP). Let the SP

X(t)

satisfy (15.73) and be of operational PSD SXX. Let r be any real integrable deter-
ministic signal. Then the operational PSD of X ⋆r is

as we next justify. The ﬁrst equality follows from Lemma 15.7.1, which shows that
at every epoch t ∈R the random variables

The second equality holds because

X(t)

is of operational PSD SXX.
15.8
The Operational PSD and Power
It would be a sin of omission not to discuss the relationship between the operational
PSD of a stochastic process and its power. Intuition suggests that the integral of
the operational PSD ought to equal the power. To see why, recall that if X is of
operational PSD SXX, then
Power in X ⋆h =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f)
ˆh(f)
2 df,
h ∈L1.
(15.81)
Suppose we now substitute for h the impulse response of a ﬁlter whose frequency
response resembles that of an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of very large cutoﬀ
frequency W ≫1. In this case the RHS of (15.81) would resemble the integral of
SXX(f) from −W to +W, which is approximately the integral from −∞to +∞
when W is very large. And as to the LHS, if W is very large, then intuition suggests
that X will hardly be altered by the ﬁlter, and the LHS would approximately equal
the power in X.
This intuition is excellent, and for most stochastic processes of interest the opera-
tional PSD indeed integrates to the power. However, as our next example shows,
there are some pathological counter-examples.
Before presenting our example in detail, we begin with the big picture. In our
example the SP X takes on the values ±1 only, so its power is 1. However, X
changes between the values +1 and −1 progressively faster the further time is from
the origin. As we next explain, this results in the power in X⋆h being zero for every
stable ﬁlter h, so X is of zero operational PSD. The integral of the operational PSD
is thus zero, while the power is one.
We next oﬀer some intuition as to why the power in X⋆h is zero. Recall that when h
is stable, its frequency response decays to zero (Theorem 6.2.11 (i)). Consequently,
above some cutoﬀfrequency, the frequency response of the ﬁlter is nearly zero.
Since our SP varies faster and faster the further we are from the origin of time,
when we are suﬃciently far from the origin of time the dynamics of our SP are
much faster than the ﬁlter’s cutoﬀfrequency. Consequently, except for transients
that result from the behavior of our SP near the origin of time, in steady state the
response of h to X will be nearly zero. Since the transients do not inﬂuence the
power in X ⋆h, the power in X ⋆h is zero. We next present the example in greater
detail.
Example 15.8.1. Consider the SP

X(t), t ∈R

whose value in the time interval
[ν, ν +1) is deﬁned for every integer ν as follows: The interval is divided into |ν|+1

(15.82b)
This SP is centered, of power P = 1, and yet its operational PSD is zero at all
frequencies. The integral of the operational PSD of X is thus strictly smaller than
the power in X.
Analysis of Example 15.8.1. At every epoch t the RV X(t) takes on the values
±1 equiprobably and is thus centered. Moreover, X2(t) is deterministically 1, so
the power in


is one. We next show that

X(t)

is of average autocovariance
function
¯KXX(τ) =

if τ = 0,
0
otherwise,
τ ∈R.
(15.83)
For τ equal to zero this follows immediately from our observation that X2(t) is
deterministically equal to one. By symmetry, it suﬃces to establish (15.83) for
positive τ.
When τ is 1 or larger, the epochs t and t + τ fall—irrespective of
t—in diﬀerent intervals, so X(t) and X(t + τ) are uncorrelated for all t.
For
such τ’s ¯KXX(τ) is thus zero, in agreement with (15.83). It thus only remains to
establish (15.83) for 0 < τ < 1. In this case t and t + τ are guaranteed to fall in
diﬀerent subintervals whenever
τ ≥
1
⌊t⌋
 + 1,
(15.84)
where the RHS is the length of the subintervals to which the interval containing t—
namely the interval [ν, ν + 1), where ν is ⌊t⌋—is subdivided. (If this inequality is
not satisﬁed, then X(t) and X(t + τ) may or may not be in diﬀerent subintervals.)
For τ ∈(0, 1), Inequality (15.84) holds whenever
⌊t⌋
 ≥τ −1 −1. Thus, when t is
outside the ﬁnite interval

t′ ∈R :
⌊t′⌋
 < τ −1 −1

the random variables X(t) and X(t + τ) are uncorrelated. For t inside this ﬁnite
interval the correlation between X(t) and X(t + τ) is upper bounded by 1. Con-
sequently, when we average E[X(t) X(t + τ)] over t, the contribution of t’s inside
this interval washes out and the result is zero.

15.8 The Operational PSD and Power
287
Having established (15.83), we conclude from Theorem 15.6.6 (i) that the power
in X ⋆h is zero for any stable ﬁlter h. The operational PSD of

X(t)

is thus
zero.
In Example 15.8.1 the power is strictly larger than the integral of the operational
PSD, and the average autocovariance function is discontinuous at the origin. As
we shall next see this is no coincidence.
The integral of the operational PSD
never exceeds the power, and the two are equal whenever the SP has an average
autocovariance function that is continuous at the origin. To emphasize that the
prevalent case is when the two are the same, we shall state the results in two
separate theorems.
Theorem 15.8.2 (The Power and the Integral of the Operational PSD). Let

X(t)

be a centered SP of power P, of operational PSD SXX, and of an average
autocovariance function ¯KXX that is continuous at the origin. Then
P =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f) df.
(15.85)
Proof. For every stable impulse response h ∈L1 we can express the power in X⋆h
in two diﬀerent ways: as in (15.63) of Theorem 15.6.6 (i) and as in the deﬁnition
of the operational PSD (Deﬁnition 15.3.1). Consequently,
 ∞
−∞
¯KXX(τ) Rhh(τ) dτ =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f)
ˆh(f)
2 df,
h ∈L1.
(15.86)
The gist of the proof is to choose h to be a very narrow pulse centered at the origin
with Rhh integrating to 1 (i.e., with
ˆh(0)
 = 1) so that the LHS of (15.86) would
approximate ¯KXX(0)—which, by Note 15.6.2, is equal to P—and so that the RHS
would approximate the integral of the operational PSD.

The ﬁrst equality follows from Note 15.6.2; the second from the hypothesis that
¯KXX is continuous at the origin and from the explicit form of Rhh (15.87c); and
the third equality follows from (15.86). The ﬁnal equality can be justiﬁed using
the Dominated Convergence Theorem because the integrand converges to SXX(f)
at every f ∈R because
lim

ˆh(f)
2 = lim

2
= SXX(f) sinc2 (λf)

which is integrable.
To prepare for the result that the integral of the operational PSD cannot exceed the
power, we send forward the following lemma, which bounds the power ampliﬁcation
of a ﬁlter. For technical reasons it only deals with impulse responses of compact
support, i.e., impulse responses that are zero outside some interval of the form
[−Δ, Δ]. This restriction allows us to deal with inputs having ﬁnite power but
inﬁnite energy.
Lemma 15.8.3. Let

X(t)

be a SP of power P, and let h be an integrable function
of compact support. If the power in X ⋆h is deﬁned, then it is bounded by
Power in X ⋆h ≤P max
f∈R
ˆh(f)
2.
(15.89)
Proof. Denote the SP X ⋆h by Y. Since h is of compact support, we can ﬁnd
some Δ > 0 such that h(t) is zero whenever |t| > Δ. We will show that for any
T > 0 and sample-path ω ∈Ω,

The result will then follow by taking expectations of both sides of the inequality;
dividing by 2T; and letting T tend to inﬁnity.
It thus remains to prove (15.90). This inequality is obvious when its RHS is inﬁnite.
Hereafter we thus focus on the case where
 T+Δ
−T−Δ
X2(ω, t) dt < ∞.
(15.91)
Starting from the deﬁnition of the convolution and recalling that h(t) is zero when-
ever |t| exceeds Δ, we obtain
Y (t) =
 ∞
−∞
X(τ) h(t −τ) dτ
=
 t+Δ
t−Δ
X(τ) h(t −τ) dτ,
and thus establish that the value of Y (t) depends only on the values of X at epochs
in the interval [t−Δ, t+Δ]. Hence, for any T > 0, the values of Y (t) for t ∈[−T, +T ]
are determined by the values of X at epochs in the interval [−T −Δ, T + Δ]. Thus,
if we deﬁne the time-windowed SP Xw as
Xw(ω, t) = X(ω, t) I

|t| ≤T + Δ

,
(15.92)
then, rather than as X ⋆h, we can also express Y for |t| ≤T as
Y (t) = (Xw ⋆h)(t),
|t| ≤T.

The ﬁrst line follows from (15.93); the second

The desired inequality (15.98) now follows from (15.103), because the latter holds
for every ϵ > 0, and the RHS of (15.103) converges to the RHS of (15.98) when ϵ
tends to zero.
We have seen that the integral of the operational PSD never exceeds the power
(Theorem 15.8.4) and that, for stochastic processes having an average autocovari-
ance function, a suﬃcient condition for equality is that this function be continuous
at the origin (Theorem 15.8.2). The next result shows that for such stochastic
processes this is also a necessary condition. (Recall that in Example 15.8.1 this
condition does not hold and the integral of the operational PSD is strictly smaller
than the power.)
Theorem 15.8.5 (Continuity at the Origin Is Necessary). Let

X(t)

tered SP of power P, of operational PSD SXX, and of average autocovariance func-
tion ¯KXX that is discontinuous at the origin. Then

be expressed as

XX is a positive deﬁnite function that is continuous, and ¯K

XX is not identically zero. Consequently its value

because ¯K

Chapter 16
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
16.1
Introduction
We next discuss linear modulation in passband. We envision being allocated band-
width W around the carrier frequency fc, so we can only send real signals whose
Fourier Transform is zero at frequencies f satisfying
|f| −fc
 > W/2.
That
is, the FT of the transmitted signal is allowed to be nonzero only in the fre-
quency interval [fc −W/2, fc + W/2] and in its negative frequency counterpart
[−fc −W/2, −fc + W/2] (Deﬁnition 7.3.1). We assume throughout this chapter
that
fc > W
2 .
(16.1)
There are numerous ways to communicate in passband and, to complicate things
further, sometimes seemingly diﬀerent approaches lead to identical signals. Thus,
while we would like to motivate the scheme we shall focus on—Quadrature Ampli-
tude Modulation (QAM)—we cannot prove or claim that it is the only “optimal”
solution.1 Nevertheless, we shall try to motivate it by discussing some features
that one would typically like to have and by then showing that QAM has these
features.
From our studies of PAM and of Nyquist’s Criterion we recall that if we are al-
located (baseband) bandwidth W Hz and if Ts ≥1/(2W), then we can ﬁnd a
bandwidth-W pulse shape whose time shifts by integer multiples of Ts are or-
thonormal. If Ts = 1/(2W), then such a pulse is the bandwidth-W unit-energy
pulse t 	→
√
2W sinc(2Wt). (You may recall that such pulses are rarely used be-
cause they decay to zero too slowly over time, thus rendering the computation
of the PAM signal unstable and the resulting peak power unbounded.)
And if
Ts < 1/(2W), then no such pulse shape exists. (Corollary 11.3.5.)
From a somewhat more abstract perspective, PAM with the above pulse shape (or
with the square root of a raised-cosine pulse shape (11.29) with very small excess
bandwidth) allows us to send symbols arriving at rate

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
as the coeﬃcients in a linear combination of orthonormal signals whose bandwidth
does not exceed (or only slightly exceeds)
Rs
2 [Hz] .
That is, for each spectral sliver of 1 Hz at baseband we obtain 2 real dimensions
per second, i.e., we can communicate at spectral eﬃciency
2 [real dimension/sec]
[baseband Hz]
.
This is an achievement that we would like to replicate for passband signaling:
First Objective: Find a way to transmit real symbols arriving at rate Rs real sym-
bols per second as the coeﬃcients in a linear combination of orthonormal passband
signals occupying a (passband) bandwidth of W Hz around the carrier frequency fc,
where the bandwidth W is equal to (or only slightly exceeds) Rs/2. That is, we
would like to ﬁnd a communication scheme that would allow us to communicate at
2 [real dimension/sec]
[passband Hz]
.
Equivalently, since any stream of real symbols arriving at rate Rs real symbols
per second can be viewed as a stream of complex symbols arriving at rate Rs/2
complex symbols per second (simply by pairing tuples (a, b) of real numbers a, b ∈R
into single complex numbers a + ib), we can restate our objective as follows: ﬁnd
a way to transmit complex symbols arriving at rate Rs/2 complex symbols per
second as the coeﬃcients in a linear combination of orthonormal passband signals
occupying a (passband) bandwidth of W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, where
the bandwidth W is equal to, or only slightly exceeds Rs/2. That is, we would like
to ﬁnd a communication scheme that would allow us to communicate at
1 [complex dimension/sec]
[passband Hz]
.
(16.2)
In addition, we would like our modulation scheme to be of reasonable complexity.
One of the beneﬁts of the baseband PAM scheme is that we can compute all the
inner products required to reconstruct the coeﬃcients (symbols) using the matched
ﬁlter by feeding it with the transmitted signal and sampling its output at the
appropriate times.
A naive approach that does not achieve our objective is to use real baseband PAM
of the type we studied in Chapter 10 and to up-convert the PAM signal to passband
by multiplying it by the mapping t 	→cos(2πfct). The problem with this approach
is that the up-conversion doubles the bandwidth (Proposition 7.3.3).
16.2
PAM for Passband?
A natural approach to passband signaling might be to consider PAM directly with-
out any up-conversion. We merely have to look for a pulse shape φ whose Fourier

16.3 The QAM Signal
297
Transform is zero outside the band
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2 and whose self-similarity
function Rφφ is a Nyquist Pulse. It turns out that with this approach we can only
achieve our objective if 4fcTs is an odd integer. Indeed, the reader is encouraged
to use Corollary 11.3.4 to verify that if a pulse φ is an energy-limited passband
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, and if its time
shifts by integer multiples of Ts are orthonormal, then
Ts ≥
1
2W
with equality being achievable only if both
|ˆφ(f)|2 = Ts I
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2

(for all frequencies f ∈R outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero) and
4fcTs
is an odd integer.
(16.3)
In fact, it can be shown that if (16.3) is satisﬁed and if ψ is any energy-limited
signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz and whose time shifts by integer multiples
of 2Ts are orthonormal, then the passband signal
φ(t) =
√
2 cos(2πfct) ψ(t),
t ∈R
is an energy-limited passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc, and its time shifts by integer multiples of Ts are orthonormal.
It would thus seem that if (16.3) is satisﬁed, then PAM would be a viable solution
to our problem. Nevertheless, this is not the standard solution. The reason may
have to do with implementation. If the above approach is used, then the carrier
frequency inﬂuences the choice of the pulse shape. Thus, a radio with a selectable
carrier frequency would require a diﬀerent pulse shape for each frequency! More-
over, the implementation of the modulator becomes carrier-dependent and fairly
complex. This discussion motivates our second objective:
Second Objective: To allow for ﬂexibility in the choice of the carrier, it is desir-
able to decouple the pulse shape selection from the carrier frequency.
16.3
The QAM Signal
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation achieves both our objectives. It achieves our
desired spectral eﬃciency (16.2) and also decouples the signal design from the
carrier frequency. It is easiest to describe QAM by describing the baseband repre-
sentation xBB(·) of the transmitted passband signal xPB(·). Indeed, the baseband
representation of the transmitted signal has the structure of PAM but with one
important diﬀerence: we allow for complex symbols and for complex pulse shapes.2
In QAM the encoder
ϕ: {0, 1}k →Cn
(16.4)
2Allowing complex pulse shapes is not critical. Crucial is that we allow complex symbols.

portional to the real parts and the imaginary parts of the symbols {Cℓ}.
(ii) The normalization factor of 1/
√
2 in the deﬁnition of the functions {gI,ℓ} and
{gQ,ℓ} is for convenience only. Its role will become clearer in Section 16.5,
where the pulse shape is chosen to be of unit energy. In this case the factor of

√
2 guarantees that the functions {gI,ℓ} and {gQ,ℓ} are also of unit energy.
(iii) We could also view QAM slightly diﬀerently as a modulation scheme where
data bits D1, . . . , Dk are mapped to 2n real numbers X1, . . . , X2n, which are
then grouped in pairs to form the n complex numbers Cℓ= X2ℓ−1 + iX2ℓ
for ℓ= 1, . . . , n and where these complex numbers are then mapped into the
passband signal whose baseband representation is given in (16.5a). The two
views are, of course, completely equivalent.
The expression for the QAM signal XPB(·) is simpliﬁed if the pulse shape g is real.
In this case we obtain from (16.6) for every t ∈R
XPB(t) = 2A

ℓ=1
Im(Cℓ) g(t −ℓTs) sin(2πfct),
g real.
(16.10)
Thus, if the pulse shape g is real, then the QAM signal can be viewed as the
sum of two signals: the ﬁrst is the result of feeding {Re(Cℓ)} to a baseband PAM
modulator of pulse shape g and multiplying the result by cos(2πfct), and the second
is the result of feeding {Im(Cℓ)} to a baseband PAM modulator of pulse shape g
and multiplying the result by −sin(2πfct). Figure 16.1 illustrates the generation
of the QAM signal when the pulse shape g is real.
16.4
Bandwidth Considerations
The baseband representation of the QAM signal XPB(·) of (16.5c) is the baseband
PAM signal XBB(·) of (16.5a). By Corollary 10.10.2 (which also holds for complex
pulse shapes and symbols), the bandwidth of XBB(·) is the bandwidth of the pulse
shape g. Consequently, since the bandwidth of a passband signal around the carrier
frequency is twice the bandwidth of its baseband representation (Proposition 7.6.7
and Theorem 7.7.12 (i)), we conclude:
Note 16.4.1 (Bandwidth around fc of QAM). Unless the QAM signal is zero, its
bandwidth around the carrier frequency is twice the bandwidth of the pulse shape.

Orthogonality Considerations
We next study the consequences of choosing the pulse shape g(·) so that its time
shifts by integer multiples of Ts be orthonormal. As in our treatment of PAM, we
change notation and denote the pulse shape in this case by φ(·). The orthonormal-
ity condition is thus

φ(t −ℓTs) φ∗(t −ℓ′Ts) dt = I{ℓ= ℓ′},

(16.12)
for all frequencies f outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
When the pulse shape satisﬁes the orthogonality condition (16.11) we refer to 1/Ts
as having units of complex dimensions per second. In analogy to Deﬁnition 11.3.6,
we deﬁne the excess bandwidth as
100%

16.6 Spectral Eﬃciency

16.6
Spectral Eﬃciency
We next show that QAM achieves our spectral eﬃciency objective. We assume
that we are only allowed to transmit signals of bandwidth W around the carrier
frequency fc, so the transmitted signal can only occupy the frequencies f satisfying
|f| −fc
 ≤W/2.
In order for the QAM signal to meet this constraint, we choose a pulse shape φ
that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, because the up-conversion doubles the bandwidth
(Note 16.4.1). Thus, by Corollary 11.3.5, the orthogonality (16.11) can only hold
if the baud period Ts satisﬁes Ts ≥1/(2 × W/2) or
Ts ≥1
W,
with the RHS being achievable by choosing φ to be the bandwidth-W/2 unit-energy
signal t 	→
√
W sinc(Wt).
If we choose Ts equal to 1/W (or only slightly larger than that), then our modulation
will support the transmission of complex symbols arriving at a rate of 1/Ts ≈W
complex symbols per second.
And since our QAM signal only occupies W Hz
around the carrier frequency, our scheme achieves a spectral eﬃciency of 1 [complex
dimension per second] per Hz. QAM thus achieves our spectral eﬃciency objective.
This is so exciting that we highlight the achievement:
QAM with the bandwidth-W/2 unit-energy pulse shape given by
t 	→
√
W sinc(Wt) transmits a sequence of real symbols arriving at
a rate of 2W real symbols per second as the coeﬃcients in a linear
combination of orthogonal signals, with the resulting waveform
being bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. It
thus achieves a spectral eﬃciency of
2 [real dimension/sec]
[passband Hz]
= 1 [complex dimension/sec]
[passband Hz]
.
16.7
QAM Constellations
In analogy to the deﬁnition of the constellation of a PAM scheme (Section 10.8),
we deﬁne the constellation of a QAM scheme (or, perhaps more appropriately, of
the mapping ϕ(·) in (16.4)) as the smallest subset of C of which Cℓis an element
for every ℓ∈{1, . . . , n} and for every realization of the data bits.
We denote
the constellation by C. The number of points in the constellation C is just the
number of elements of C.
Important constellations include the square 4-QAM constellation (also known as
QPSK)

points. However, some engineers omit the word “square” and write 4-QAM, 16-
QAM, 64-QAM, etc. for the respective square constellations.

Finally, in analogy to our deﬁnition of uncoded PAM transmission (Section 10.9),
we say that the QAM transmission is uncoded when the range of ϕ equals Cn.

Recovering the Complex Symbols via Inner Products

are orthonormal, then the QAM signal can be written as

where the signals . . . , ψI,−1, ψQ,−1, ψI,0, ψQ,0, ψI,1, ψQ,1, . . ., which are given in
(16.15), are orthonormal. Consequently, the complex symbols can be recovered
from the QAM signal (in the absence of noise) using the inner products:
Re(Cℓ) =

Im(Cℓ) =

2A ⟨XPB, ψQ,ℓ⟩,
ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(16.23b)
We next describe circuits to compute these inner products. With a view to future
chapters where noise will be present, we shall describe more general circuits that
compute the inner products ⟨r, ψI,ℓ⟩and ⟨r, ψQ,ℓ⟩for an arbitrary (not necessarily
QAM) energy-limited signal r. Moreover, since the calculation of the inner products
will not exploit the orthogonality condition (16.11), we shall describe the more
general setting where the pulse shape is arbitrary and refer to the notation of
(16.7). Thus, we shall present circuits to compute
⟨r, gI,ℓ⟩, ⟨r, gQ,ℓ⟩,
where gI,ℓand gQ,ℓand their baseband representations are given in (16.8) and
(16.9). Here r is an arbitrary energy-limited signal. We present two approaches:
an approach based on baseband conversion and a direct approach.
16.8.1
Inner Products via Baseband Conversion
We begin by noting that if the pulse shape g is bandlimited to W/2 Hz then both
gI,ℓand gQ,ℓare bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. Conse-
quently, since they contain no energy outside the bands [fc −W/2, fc + W/2] and

[−fc−W/2, −fc+W/2], it follows from Parseval’s Theorem that the Fourier Trans-
form of r outside these bands does not inﬂuence the value of the inner products.
Thus, if s is the result of passing r through an ideal unit-gain bandpass ﬁlter of
bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc, i.e.,
s = r ⋆BPFW,fc,
(16.24)
then
⟨r, gI,ℓ⟩= ⟨s, gI,ℓ⟩,

⟨r, gQ,ℓ⟩= ⟨s, gQ,ℓ⟩.

We next describe circuits to compute the RHS of (16.26a) & (16.26b). The circuit
to produce sBB from s was already discussed in Section 7.6 on the baseband rep-
resentation of passband signals (Figure 7.11). One multiplies s(t) by e−i2πfct and
then passes the result through a lowpass ﬁlter whose cutoﬀfrequency Wc satisﬁes

front-end bandpass ﬁlter and the circuit for producing sBB. The second diagram
includes the matched ﬁltering needed to compute the RHS of (16.31a) and the
RHS of (16.31b). Notice that we have accomplished our second objective in that
the ﬁrst circuit depends only on the carrier frequency fc (and the bandwidth W)
and the second circuit depends on the pulse shape but not on the carrier frequency.

(16.33b)
The two approaches we discussed for computing the inner products are, of course,
mathematically equivalent. The former makes more engineering sense, because the
bandpass ﬁlter typically guarantees that the energy in s is signiﬁcantly smaller
than in r, thus reducing the dynamic range required from the rest of the receiver.
The latter approach is mathematically cleaner because it requires less mathemat-
ical justiﬁcation. One need not check that the various ﬁlters satisfy the required
integrability conditions.
Moreover, this approach is more useful when r is not
energy-limited and when this is compensated for by the fast decay of the pulse
shape. (See, for example, the situation addressed by Proposition 3.4.4.)
16.9
Filtering QAM Signals
With all the simpliﬁcations aﬀorded by using a real pulse shape, why use a complex
one?
Why not restrict attention to real pulse shapes?
One reason is that we
sometimes end up with a complex pulse shape through no choice of ours. This can
happen, for example, when the transmitted signal that we have carefully designed is
passed through some ﬁlter over which we have no control. Indeed, as we next show,
passing a QAM signal through a ﬁlter is tantamount to replacing its pulse shape
by a pulse shape that might be complex even when the original one is real. Thus,
a linearly-dispersive channel of the kind we shall study in Chapter 32 transforms

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
a QAM signal of a real pulse shape into one of a complex pulse shape (and adds
noise to boot).
Proposition 16.9.1 (QAM Signals through Stable Filters). Let XPB be a QAM
signal of the form (16.6), where the pulse shape g is an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W/2 Hz and where fc > W/2. Passing XPB through a stable real
ﬁlter of impulse response h ∈L1 is tantamount to replacing its pulse shape g by
the pulse shape p, which is deﬁned as
p(t) =

and which is a complex integrable signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz and whose
FT is

f ∈R.
(16.34b)
Proof. To identify the role of p, consider the signal t 	→2 Re

g(t) ei2πfct
. Since g
is an integrable signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, this signal is a real integrable
passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around fc. Its baseband representa-
tion is g. It follows from Proposition 7.6.13 that the result of convolving this signal
with some real h ∈L1 is a real integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to
W Hz around fc and whose baseband representation is p

Moreover, by the same proposition, the FT of p is given by (16.34b).
Having identiﬁed the role of p and having established (16.34b), we next proceed
to study the result of ﬁltering XPB. From Proposition 7.6.13 we conclude that
XPB ⋆h is an integrable passband signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around fc,
and that its baseband representation (XPB ⋆h)BB is of FT
f 	→ˆXBB(f) ˆh(f + fc),
f ∈R,
(16.36)
where XBB is the baseband representation of XPB and is given in (16.5a). The FT
of XBB can be readily computed from (16.5a) using the basic properties of the FT

Chapter 17
Complex Random Variables and Processes
17.1
Introduction
We ﬁrst encountered complex random variables in Chapter 16 on QAM. There we
considered an encoder that maps k-tuples of bits into n-tuples of complex numbers,
and we then considered the result of applying this encoder to random bits. The
resulting symbols were therefore random and were taking values in the complex
ﬁeld, i.e., they were complex random variables. Complex random variables are
functions that map “luck” into the complex ﬁeld: they map every outcome of the
experiment ω ∈Ω to a complex number. Thus, they are very much like regular
random variables, except that they take values in the complex ﬁeld. They can
always be considered as pairs of real variables: their real and imaginary parts.
It is perfectly meaningful to discuss their expectation and variance.

In this chapter we shall make the above deﬁnition of complex random variables
more formal and also discuss complex random vectors and complex stochastic pro-
cesses.
Complex random variables can be avoided if one treats such variables as pairs of
real variables. However, we do not recommend this approach. Many of the complex
random variables and processes encountered in Digital Communications possess ad-
ditional properties that simplify their manipulation, and complex random variables
are better suited to take advantage of these simpliﬁcations.
We begin this chapter with some notation followed by some basic deﬁnitions for
complex random variables.
We next introduce a property that simpliﬁes their

14:31:29, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

17.2 Notation
315
manipulation: properness. (Another such property, circular symmetry, is described
in Chapter 24.) Finally, we extend the discussion to complex random vectors and
conclude with a discussion of complex stochastic processes.
17.2
Notation
The notation we use in this chapter is fairly standard. The only issue that may
need clariﬁcation is the diﬀerence between three matrix/vector operations: trans-
position, conjugation, and Hermitian conjugation. These operations are described
next.
All vectors in this chapter are column vectors. Thus, a vector a whose components
are a(1), . . . , a(n) is the column vector
a =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
a(1)
a(2)
...
a(n)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠.
(17.1)
We shall sometimes refer to such a vector a as an n-vector to make the number of
its components explicit. For typesetting reasons, we shall usually use the notation
a =

a(1), . . . , a(n)T,
(17.2)
which is more space eﬃcient. Here the operator (·)T denotes the matrix trans-
pose. Thus if we think of (a(1), . . . a(n)) as a 1 × n matrix, then (a(1), . . . a(n))T is
this matrix’s transpose, i.e., an n × 1 matrix, or a vector. More generally, if A is
an n × m matrix, then AT is an m × n matrix whose Row-j Column-ℓcomponent
is the Row-ℓColumn-j component of A. We say that A is symmetric if AT = A.
We use (·)∗to denote componentwise complex conjugation. Thus, if a is as
in (17.1), then
a∗=
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝

a(1)∗

a(2)∗
...

a(n)∗
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠.
(17.3)
We use (·)† to denote Hermitian conjugation, i.e., the componentwise conjugate
of the transposed matrix. Thus, if a is as in (17.1), then a† is the 1 × n matrix
a† =

a(1)∗, . . . ,

a(n)∗
.
(17.4)
The Hermitian conjugate A† of an n×m matrix A is an m×n matrix whose Row-j
Column-ℓcomponent is the complex conjugate of the Row-ℓColumn-j component
of the matrix A. We say that a matrix A is conjugate-symmetric or self-adjoint
or Hermitian if A† = A.
Note that if a and b are n-vectors, then aTb is a scalar

Complex Random Variables
We say that C is a complex random variable (CRV) on the probability space
(Ω, F, P) if C : Ω →C is a mapping from Ω to the complex ﬁeld C such that both
Re(C) and Im(C) are random variables on (Ω, F, P).
Any CRV Z can be written in the form Z = X + i Y , where X and Y are real
random variables. But there are some advantages to studying complex random
variables over pairs of real random variables. Those will become apparent when we
discuss analytic functions of complex random variables and when we discuss com-
plex random variables that have special properties such as that of being “proper”
or that of being “circularly-symmetric.”
Many of the deﬁnitions related to complex random variables are similar to the
analogous deﬁnitions for pairs of real random variables, but some are not. We
shall try to emphasize the latter.
17.3.1
Distribution and Density
Since it makes no sense to say that one complex number is smaller than another, we
cannot deﬁne the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a CRV as in the real
case: an expression like “Pr[Z ≤1 + i]” is meaningless. We can, however, discuss
the joint distribution function of the real and imaginary parts of a CRV, which
speciﬁes Pr[Re(Z) ≤x, Im(Z) ≤y] for all x, y ∈R. We say that two complex
random variables W and Z are of equal law (or have the same distribution) and
write W
L= Z, if the joint distribution of the pair (Re(W), Im(W)) is identical to
the joint distribution of the pair (Re(Z), Im(Z)):

.
(17.6)
Similarly, we can deﬁne the density function fZ(·) (if it exists) of a CRV Z at the
point z ∈C as the joint density of the real pair (Re(Z), Im(Z)) at (Re(z), Im(z)):
fZ(z) ≜fRe(Z),Im(Z)

17.3 Complex Random Variables
317
The notions of distribution function and density of a CRV extend immediately to
pairs of complex variables and, more generally, to n-tuples.
17.3.2
The Expectation
The expectation of a CRV can be deﬁned in terms of the expectations of its real
and imaginary parts:
E[Z] = E[Re(Z)] + i E[Im(Z)] ,
(17.9)
provided that the two real expectations E[Re(Z)] and E[Im(Z)] are ﬁnite. With
this deﬁnition one can readily verify that, whenever E[Z] is deﬁned, conjugation
and expectation commute
E[Z∗] = (E[Z])∗,
(17.10)
and

(17.11a)
Im

E[Z]


Im(Z)

.
(17.11b)
If the CRV Z has a density fZ(·), then the expectation E[g(Z)] for some measurable
function g: C →C can be formally written as
E

g(Z)

=

z∈C
fZ(z) g(z) dz

(17.13)
Thus, rather than computing the distribution of g(Z) and then computing the
expectations of its real and imaginary parts, one can use (17.12).
17.3.3
The Variance
The deﬁnition of the variance of a CRV is not consistent with viewing the CRV as
a pair of real random variables. The variance Var[Z] of a CRV Z is deﬁned as
Var[Z] ≜E

Complex Random Variables and Processes
One can compute the variance of Z from the covariance matrix of (Re(Z), Im(Z)),
but not the other way around. Indeed, the variance of Z is just the trace of the
covariance matrix of (Re(Z), Im(Z)).
To derive (17.14b) from (17.14a) we note that
E

|Z −E[Z]|2
= E

(Z −E[Z])(Z −E[Z])∗

|Z|2
−|E[Z]|2,
where we only used the linearity of expectation and (17.10). Here the ﬁrst equality
follows by writing |w|2 as ww∗; the second by (17.10); the third by simple algebra;
the fourth because the expectation of Z −E[Z] is zero; and the ﬁnal by (17.10).
To derive (17.14c) from (17.14b) we write E

|Z|2
as E

(Re(Z))2 + (Im(Z))2
and
express |E[Z]|2 using (17.9) as E[Re(Z)]2 + E[Im(Z)]2.
17.3.4
Proper Complex Random Variables
Many of the complex random variables that appear in Digital Communications
are proper. This is a concept that has no natural counterpart for real random
variables.
Deﬁnition 17.3.1 (Proper CRV). We say that the CRV Z is proper if the following
three conditions are all satisﬁed: it is of zero-mean; it is of ﬁnite variance; and
E

Z2
= 0.
(17.15)
Notice that the LHS of (17.15) is, in general, a complex number, so (17.15) is
equivalent to two real equations:
E

Re(Z)2
= E

Im(Z)2
(17.16a)
and
E

Re(Z) Im(Z)

= 0.
(17.16b)
This leads to the following characterization of proper complex random variables.
Proposition 17.3.2. A CRV Z is proper if, and only if, all three of the following
conditions are satisﬁed: Z is of zero mean; Re(Z) & Im(Z) have the same ﬁnite
variance; and Re(Z) & Im(Z) are uncorrelated.
An example of a proper CRV is one taking on the four values {±1, ±i} equiprobably.
We mentioned earlier in Section 17.3.3 that the variance of a CRV is not the
same as the covariance matrix of the tuple consisting of its real and imaginary
parts.
While the covariance matrix determines the variance, the variance does

17.3 Complex Random Variables

not uniquely determine the covariance matrix. However, if a CRV is proper, then
its variance uniquely determines the covariance matrix of its real and imaginary
parts. Indeed, by Proposition 17.3.2 and (17.14c), a zero-mean ﬁnite-variance CRV
is proper if, and only if, the covariance matrix of the pair (Re(Z), Im(Z)) is

The covariance Cov[Z, W] between the complex random variables Z and W is
deﬁned by
Cov[Z, W] ≜E
%
Z −E[Z]

W −E[W]
∗&
.
(17.17)
Again, this deﬁnition is diﬀerent from the one for pairs of real random variables:
the covariance between two pairs of real random variables is a real matrix, whereas
the covariance between two CRVs is a complex scalar.
Some of the key properties of the covariance are listed next. They hold whenever
the α’s and β’s are deterministic complex numbers and the covariances on the RHS
are deﬁned.

(ii) Sesquilinearity:
Cov[αZ, W] = α Cov[Z, W] ,

Cov[Z1 + Z2, W] = Cov[Z1, W] + Cov[Z2, W] ,
(17.20)
Cov[Z, βW] = β∗Cov[Z, W] ,

17.3.6
The Characteristic Function
The deﬁnition of the characteristic function of a CRV is consistent with viewing it as
a pair of real random variables. Recall that the characteristic function ΦX : R →C
of a real random variable X is deﬁned by
ΦX : ϖ 	→E

eiϖX
,
ϖ ∈R.
(17.26)
For a pair of real random variables X, Y the joint characteristic function is the
mapping ΦX,Y : R2 →C deﬁned by
ΦX,Y : (ϖ1, ϖ2) 	→E
%
ei(ϖ1X+ϖ2Y )&
,
ϖ1, ϖ2 ∈R.
(17.27)
Note that the expectations in (17.26) and (17.27) are always deﬁned, because the
argument to the expectation operator is of modulus one (|eir| = 1, whenever r is
real). This motivates us to deﬁne the characteristic function for a complex random
variable as follows.
Deﬁnition 17.3.3 (Characteristic Function of a CRV). The characteristic func-
tion ΦZ : C →C of a complex random variable Z is deﬁned as
ΦZ(ϖ) ≜E
%
ei Re(ϖ∗Z)&
,
ϖ ∈C
= E
%
ei( Re(ϖ) Re(Z)+Im(ϖ) Im(Z))&
,
ϖ ∈C.
Here we can think of Re(ϖ) and Im(ϖ) as playing the role of ϖ1 and ϖ2 in (17.27).
17.3.7
Transforming Complex Variables
We next calculate the density of the result of applying a (deterministic) transfor-
mation to a CRV. The key to the calculation is to treat the CRV as a pair of real
random variables and to then apply the analogous result regarding the transfor-
mation of a random real tuple. To that end we recall the following basic theorem
regarding the transformation of real random vectors. In the theorem’s statement
we encounter the notion of an open subset of Rn. Loosely speaking, D ⊆Rn is an
open subset of Rn if to each x ∈D there corresponds some ϵ > 0 such that the
ball of radius ϵ and center x is fully contained in D.1
Theorem 17.3.4 (Transforming Real Random Vectors). Let g: D →R be a one-
to-one mapping from an open subset D of Rn onto a subset R of Rn. Assume
that g has continuous partial derivatives in D and that the Jacobian determinant
det (∂g(x)/∂x) is at no point of D zero.
Let the real random n-vector X have
the density function fX(·) and satisfy Pr[X ∈D] = 1. Then the random n-vector
Y = g(X) is of density
fY(y) =
fX(x)
det ∂g(x)
∂x


x=g−1(y)
· I{y ∈R}.
(17.28)
1Thus, D is an open subset of Rn if D ⊆Rn and if to each x ∈D there corresponds some
ϵ > 0 such that each y ∈Rn satisfying (x −y)T(x −y) ≤ϵ2 is in D.

17.3 Complex Random Variables

Using Theorem 17.3.4 we can relate the density of a CRV Z and the joint distri-
bution of its phase and magnitude.
Lemma 17.3.5 (The Joint Density of the Magnitude and Phase of a CRV). Let Z
be a CRV of density fZ(·), and let R = |Z| and Θ ∈[−π, π) be the magnitude and
argument of Z:
Z = R eiΘ,
R ≥0, Θ ∈[−π, π).
Then the joint distribution of the pair (R, Θ) is of density
fR,Θ(r, θ) = rfZ

r eiθ
,
r > 0, θ ∈[−π, π).
(17.29)
Proof. This result follows directly from Theorem 17.3.4 by computing the absolute
value of the Jacobian determinant of the transformation2 (x, y) 	→(r, θ) where
r =

For the next change-of-variables result we recall some basic concepts from Complex
Analysis. Given some z0 ∈C and some nonnegative real number r ≥0, we denote
by D(z0, r) the disc of radius r that is centered at z0:
D(z0, r) ≜{z ∈C : |z −z0| < r}.
We say that a subset D of the complex plane is open if to each z ∈D there
corresponds some ϵ > 0 such that D(z0, ϵ) ⊆D. Let g: D →C be some function
from an open set D ⊆C to C. Let z0 be in D. We say that g(·) is diﬀerentiable
at z0 ∈D and that its derivative at z0 is the complex number g′(z0), if for every
ϵ > 0 there exists some δ > 0 such that

(17.30)
whenever the complex number h ∈C satisﬁes 0 < |h| ≤δ. It is important to note
that here h is complex. If g is diﬀerentiable at every z ∈D, then we say that g is
holomorphic or analytic in D.3

regular. We are following here (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 10).

Proposition 17.3.6 (The Cauchy-Riemann Equations). Let D ⊆C be open and
let g: D →C be analytic in D. Let u, v be deﬁned by (17.31). Then u and v
satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations

(x,y)=( Re(z),Im(z))
,
z ∈D.
(17.33)
Moreover, the partial derivatives in (17.32) are continuous in the subset of R2
deﬁned by {x, y ∈R : x + iy ∈D}.
Proof. See (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 11, Theorem 11.2 & Theorem 11.4) or (Nehari,
1975, Chapter II, Section 5 & Chapter III, Section 3).
We can now state the change-of-variables theorem for CRVs.
Theorem 17.3.7 (Transforming Complex Random Variables). Let g: D →R be
a one-to-one mapping from an open subset D of C onto a subset R of C. Assume
that g is analytic in D and that at no point of D is the derivative of g zero. Let
the CRV have the density function fZ(·) and satisfy Pr[Z ∈D] = 1. Then the CRV
deﬁned by W = g(Z) is of density
fW (w) =
fZ(z)
|g′(z)|2

z=g−1(w)
I{w ∈R}.
(17.34)
Here g−1(w) denotes the point in D that is mapped by g to w.
Note 17.3.8. The square in (17.34) does not appear in dealing with real random
variables. It appears here because a mapping of complex numbers is essentially
two-dimensional: scaling by α ∈C translates to a scaling of area by |α|2.
Proof. To prove (17.34) we begin by expressing the function g(·) as
g(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y),

x, y ∈R, x + iy ∈D

,
where u(x, y) = Re(g(x + iy)) and v(x, y) = Im(g(x + iy)) are deﬁned in (17.31b)
and (17.31c). The density of g(Z) is, by deﬁnition, the joint density of the pair
u(Re(Z), Im(Z)), v(Re(Z), Im(Z)). And the joint density of the pair(Re(Z), Im(Z))
is just the density of Z.
Thus, if we could relate the joint density of the pair
u(Re(Z), Im(Z)), v(Re(Z), Im(Z)) to the joint density of the pair (Re(Z), Im(Z)),
then we could relate the density of g(Z) to the density of Z.
To relate the joint density of the pair u(Re(Z), Im(Z)), v(Re(Z), Im(Z)) to the
joint density of the pair (Re(Z), Im(Z)) we employ Theorem 17.3.4. To that end

the last equality follows from (17.33). The theorem now follows from (17.35) and
Theorem 17.3.4.
17.4
Complex Random Vectors
We say that Z = (Z(1), . . . , Z(n))T is a complex random vector on the probability
space (Ω, F, P) if it is a mapping from the outcome set Ω to Cn such that the real

comprising the real and imaginary parts of its components is a real random vector
on (Ω, F, P), i.e., if each of the components of Z is a CRV.
We say that the complex random vector Z = (Z(1), . . . , Z(n))T and the complex
random vector W = (W (1), . . . , W (n))T are of equal law (or have the same distri-
bution) and write Z
L= W, if the real vector taking values in R2n whose components
are the real and imaginary parts of the components of Z has the same distribution
as the analogous vector for W, i.e., if for all x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn ∈R

The expectation of a complex random vector is the vector consisting of the ex-
pectation of each of its components. We say that a complex random vector is of
ﬁnite variance if each of its components is a CRV of ﬁnite variance.
17.4.1
The Covariance Matrix
The discussion in Section 17.3.5 can be generalized to random complex vectors.
The covariance matrix KZZ of a ﬁnite-variance complex random n-vector Z is
deﬁned as the conjugate-symmetric n × n matrix
KZZ ≜E

(Z −E[Z])(Z −E[Z])†
.
(17.36)
Once again, this deﬁnition is not consistent with viewing the random complex
vector as a vector of length 2n of real random variables. The latter would have a
real symmetric 2n × 2n covariance matrix.

The reader may wonder why we have chosen to deﬁne the covariance and the covari-
ance matrix with the conjugation sign. Why not look at E

(Z −E[Z])(Z −E[Z])T
?
The reason is that (17.36) is simply much more useful in applications. For example,
for any deterministic α1, . . . , αn ∈C the variance of n
j=1 αjZj can be computed
from KZZ (using (17.25)) but not from E

(Z −E[Z])(Z −E[Z])T
.
17.4.2
Proper Complex Random Vectors
The notion of proper complex random variables extends to vectors:
Deﬁnition 17.4.1 (Proper Complex Random Vector). A complex random vector Z
is said to be proper if the following three conditions are all met: it is of zero mean;
it is of ﬁnite variance; and
E

ZZT
= 0.
(17.37)
An alternative deﬁnition can be given based on linear functionals:
Proposition 17.4.2. The complex random n-vector Z is proper if, and only if, for
every deterministic vector α ∈Cn the CRV αTZ is proper.
Proof. We begin by noting that Z is of zero mean if, and only if, αTZ is of zero
mean for all α ∈Cn. This can be seen from the relation
E

αTZ

= αTE[Z] ,
α ∈Cn.
(17.38)
Indeed, (17.38) demonstrates that if Z is of zero mean then so is αTZ for every
α ∈Cn. Conversely, if αTZ is of zero mean for all α ∈Cn, then, a fortiori, it must
also be of zero mean for the choice of α = E[Z]∗, which yields that 0 = E[Z]† E[Z]
and hence that E[Z] must be zero (because E[Z]† E[Z] is the sum of the squared
magnitudes of the components of E[Z]).
We next note that Z is of ﬁnite variance if, and only if, αTZ is of ﬁnite variance
for every α ∈Cn. The proof is not diﬃcult and is omitted.
We thus continue with the proof under the assumption that Z is of zero mean and
of ﬁnite variance. We note that for any deterministic complex vector α ∈Cn

α ∈Cn,
(17.39)
where the ﬁrst equality follows by writing the square of a random variable as the
product of the variable by itself; the second because the transpose of a scalar is
the original scalar; the third by the transpose rule
(AB)T = BTAT;
(17.40)
and the ﬁnal equality because α is deterministic.

17.4 Complex Random Vectors
325
From (17.39) it follows that if Z is proper, then so is αTZ for all α ∈Cn. Actually,
(17.39) also proves the reverse implication by substituting A = E

ZZT
in the
following fact from Matrix Theory:

αTAα = 0, α ∈Cn
=⇒

A = 0

,
A symmetric.
(17.41)
To prove this fact from Matrix Theory assume that A is symmetric, i.e., that
a(j,ℓ) = a(ℓ,j),
j, ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(17.42)
Let α = eℓwhere eℓis all-zero except for its ℓ-th component, which is one. The
equality eT
ℓAeℓ= 0 for every ℓ∈{1, . . . , n} is equivalent to
a(ℓ,ℓ) = 0,
ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(17.43)
Next choose α = ej + eℓ. The equality
(ej + eℓ)TA(ej + eℓ) = 0
for every j, ℓ∈{1, . . . , n} is then equivalent to
a(j,ℓ) + a(j,j) + a(ℓ,j) + a(ℓ,ℓ) = 0,
j, ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(17.44)
Equations (17.42), (17.43), and (17.44) guarantee that the matrix A is all-zero.
An important observation regarding complex random vectors is that a linearly-
transformed proper vector is also proper:
Proposition 17.4.3 (Linear Transformation of a Proper Random Vector). If the
complex random n-vector Z is proper, then so is the complex random m-vector AZ
for every deterministic m × n complex matrix A.
Proof. We leave it to the reader to verify that the hypothesis that Z is proper
implies that AZ must be of zero mean and of ﬁnite variance. To show that AZ
is proper, it thus remains to show that E

(AZ)(AZ)T
= 0. This we do by direct
calculation:
E

(AZ)(AZ)T
= E

AZZTAT
= AE

ZZT
AT
= 0,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the rule for the transpose of a product (17.40);
the second because A is deterministic; and the last from the hypothesis that Z is
proper, so E

ZZT
= 0.

This connection and the fact that two random 2n-vectors have identical laws if,
and only if, they have identical characteristic functions (Proposition 23.4.4) can be
used to obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 17.4.4. Two complex n-vectors are of equal law if, and only if, their
characteristic functions are identical:

Z
L= W

⇐⇒

ΦZ(ϖ) = ΦW(ϖ), ϖ ∈Cn
.
(17.45)
Corollary 17.4.5. The complex random n-vectors Z and W are of equal law if, and
only if, for every deterministic vector α ∈Cn the complex random variables αTZ
and αTW are of equal law:

Z
L= W

⇐⇒

αTZ
L= αTW,
α ∈Cn
.
(17.46)
Proof. The direction that needs proof is that equality in law of all linear combi-
nations implies equality in law between the vectors. But this readily follows from
Theorem 17.4.4, because equality in law of the linear combinations implies that the
law of ϖ†Z is equal to the law of ϖ†W for every ϖ ∈Cn. This in turn implies
that ei Re(ϖ†Z) L= ei Re(ϖ†W), from which, upon taking expectations, we obtain that
Z and W have identical characteristic functions. Thus, by the theorem, they are
equal in law.
17.4.4
Transforming Complex Random Vectors
The change of density rule (17.34) can be generalized to analytic multi-variable
mappings (Exercise 17.13). But here we shall only present a version of this result
for linear mappings:

Lemma 17.4.6 (Linearly Transforming Complex Random Vectors). Let the com-
plex random n-vector W be given by
W = AZ,
where A is a nonsingular deterministic complex n×n matrix, and where the complex
random n-vector Z has the density fZ(·). Then W is of density
fW(w) =
1
|det A|2 fZ(A−1w),
w ∈Cn.
(17.47)
Proof. The proof is based on viewing the complex n × n linear transformation
from Z to W as a 2n×2n real transformation, and on then applying Theorem 17.3.4.
Stack the real parts of the components of Z on top of the imaginary parts in a real
random 2n-vector S:

We can then express T as the result of multiplying the random vector S by a

T =

−Im(A)
Im(A)
Re(A)

S,
where Re(A) and Im(A) denote the componentwise real and imaginary parts of A.
The result will follow from Theorem 17.3.4 once we show that the absolute value
of the Jacobian determinant of this transformation is |det A|2. Using elementary
row and column operations we compute:

Discrete-Time Complex Stochastic Processes
Deﬁnition 12.2.1 of a real stochastic process extends to the complex case as follows.
Deﬁnition 17.5.1 (Complex Stochastic Process). A complex stochastic pro-
cess (CSP)

Z(t), t ∈T

is a collection of complex random variables that are
deﬁned on a common probability space (Ω, F, P) and that are indexed by some
set T .
A CSP

Z(t), t ∈T

is said to be centered if for each t ∈T the CRV Z(t) is of
zero mean. Similarly, the CSP is said to be of ﬁnite variance if for each t ∈T the
CRV Z(t) is of ﬁnite variance. A discrete-time CSP corresponds to the case where
the index set T is the set of integers Z. Discrete-time complex stochastic processes
are not very diﬀerent from the real-valued ones we encountered in Chapter 13.
Consequently, we shall present the main deﬁnitions and results succinctly with
an emphasis on the issues where the complex and real processes diﬀer.
As in
Chapter 13, when dealing with a discrete-time CSP we shall use subscripts to

A discrete-time CSP

joint distribution of the n-tuple (Zη′, . . . , Zη′+n−1). This deﬁnition is essentially
identical to the analogous deﬁnition for real processes (Deﬁnition 13.2.1). Similarly,
Proposition 13.2.2 holds verbatim also for complex stochastic processes. Proposi-
tion 13.2.3 also holds for complex stochastic processes with the slight modiﬁcation
that the deterministic coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn are now allowed to be arbitrary com-
plex numbers:
Proposition 17.5.2. A discrete-time CSP

The deﬁnition of a wide-sense stationary CSP is very similar to the analogous

Deﬁnition 17.5.3 (Wide-Sense Stationary Discrete-Time CSP). We say that
a discrete-time CSP

covariance stationary if the following three conditions all hold:
1) For every ν ∈Z the CRV Zν is of ﬁnite variance.
2) The mean of Zν does not depend on ν.
3) The expectation E[Zν Z∗

Note the conjugation in (17.50). We do not require that E[Zν′Zν] be computable
from ν −ν′; it may or may not be. Thus, we do not require that the matrix
	E[Re(Zν′) Re(Zν)]
E[Re(Zν′) Im(Zν)]
E[Im(Zν′) Re(Zν)]
E[Im(Zν′) Im(Zν)]

be computable from ν −ν′. This matrix is, however, computable from ν −ν′ if the
process is proper:
Deﬁnition 17.5.4 (Proper CSP). A discrete-time CSP

Zν

is said to be proper
if the following three conditions all hold: it is centered; it is of ﬁnite variance; and
E[Zν Zν′] = 0,
ν, ν′ ∈Z.
(17.51)
Equivalently, a discrete-time CSP

Zν

is proper if, and only if, for every positive
integer n and all ν1, . . . , νn ∈Z the complex random vector (Zν1, . . . , Zνn)T is
proper. Equivalently,

αjZνj is proper
(17.52)
(Proposition 17.4.2).
The alternative deﬁnition of WSS real processes in terms of the variance of linear
functionals of the process (Proposition 13.3.3) requires little change:
Proposition 17.5.5. A ﬁnite-variance discrete-time CSP


n

αjZνj and
n

have the same mean & variance.
(17.53)
Proof. We begin by assuming that

Zν

is WSS and prove (17.53). The equality
of expectations follows directly from the linearity of expectation and from the fact
that because

Zν

is WSS the mean of Zν does not depend on ν. In proving the
equality of the variances we use (17.25):

Complex Random Variables and Processes
We next turn to proving that (17.53) implies that

Zν

is WSS. Choosing n = 1 and
α1 = 1 we obtain, by considering the equality of the means, that E[Zν] = E[Zν+η]
for all η ∈Z, i.e., that the mean of the process is constant. And, by considering
the equality of the variances, we obtain that the random variables

Zν

all have
the same variance
Var[Zν] = Var[Zν+η] ,
ν, η ∈Z.
(17.54)
Choosing n = 2 and α1 = α2 = 1 we obtain from the equality of the variances
Var[Zν1 + Zν2] = Var[Zν1+η + Zν2+η] .
(17.55)
But, by (17.25) and (17.54),
Var[Zν1 + Zν2] = 2 Var[Z1] + 2 Re

Cov[Zν1, Zν2]

(17.56)
and similarly
Var[Zν1+η + Zν2+η] = 2 Var[Z1] + 2 Re

Cov[Zν1+η, Zν2+η]

.
(17.57)


Cov[Zν1, Zν2]

,
η, ν1, ν2 ∈Z.
(17.58)
We now repeat the argument with α1 = 1 and α2 = i:
Var[Zν1 + i Zν2] = Var[Zν1] + Var[Zν2] + 2 Re

Cov[Zν1, i Zν2]

= 2 Var[Z1] + 2 Im

Cov[Zν1, Zν2]

and similarly
Var[Zν1+η + i Zν2+η] = 2 Var[Z1] + 2 Im

Cov[Zν1+η, Zν2+η]

,
so the equality of the variances implies
Im

Cov[Zν1+η, Zν2+η]

= Im

Cov[Zν1, Zν2]

,
η, ν1, ν2 ∈Z,
which combines with (17.58) to prove Cov[Zν1+η, Zν2+η] = Cov[Zν1, Zν2].
As with real processes, a comparison of Propositions 17.5.5 and 17.5.2 yields that
any ﬁnite-variance stationary CSP is also WSS. The reverse is not true.

By mimicking the derivations of (13.12) (taking into account the conjugate symme-
try (17.18)) we obtain that the autocovariance function KZZ of every discrete-time
WSS CSP

Zν

satisﬁes the conjugate-symmetry condition
KZZ(−η) = K∗
ZZ(η) ,
η ∈Z.
(17.60)
Similarly, by mimicking the derivation of (13.13) (i.e., from the nonnegativity of

a process satisﬁes, for every positive integer n,

satisﬁes (17.62) and (17.63), then we say that K(·) is a positive deﬁnite function
from the integers to the complex ﬁeld.
Deﬁnition 13.6.1 of the power spectral density SZZ requires no change.
We
require that SZZ be integrable on the interval [−1/2, 1/2) and that
KZZ(η) =
 1/2

SZZ(θ) ei2πηθ dθ,
η ∈Z.
(17.64)
Proposition 13.6.3 does require some alteration. Indeed, for complex stochastic
processes the PSD need not be a symmetric function. However, the main result
(that the PSD is real and nonnegative) remains true:
Proposition 17.5.7 (PSDs of Complex Processes Are Nonnegative).
(i) If the discrete-time WSS CSP

Zν

is of PSD SZZ, then
SZZ(θ) ≥0,
(17.65)
except possibly on a subset of the interval [−1/2, 1/2) of Lebesgue measure
zero.
(ii) If a function S: [−1/2, 1/2) →R is integrable and nonnegative, then there
exists a proper discrete-time WSS CSP7 
Zν

whose PSD SZZ is given by
SZZ(θ) = S(θ),
θ ∈[−1/2, 1/2).
6In fact, it is the autocovariance function of some proper Gaussian stochastic process. Com-
plex Gaussian random processes will be discussed in Chapter 24.
7The process can be taken to be Gaussian; see Chapter 24.

As in the real case, by possibly changing the value of SZZ on the set of Lebesgue
measure zero where (17.65) is violated, we can obtain a power spectral density that
is nonnegative for all θ ∈[−1/2, 1/2). Consequently, we shall always assume that
the PSD, if it exists, is nonnegative for all θ ∈[−1/2, 1/2).
Proof of Proposition 17.5.7. We begin with Part (i), where we need to prove the
nonnegativity of the PSD. We shall only sketch the proof. We recommend reading
Appendix A through Theorem A.2.2 before reading this proof.
Let KZZ denote the autocovariance function of the WSS CSP

the periodic one of (A.6).

is equivalent to conjugating the integral; and the ﬁnal equality again by (17.66).

Proposition 13.6.6 needs very little alteration. We only need to drop the symmetry

The Spectral Distribution Function that we encountered in Section 13.7 has a

in Theorem 13.7.1, here Θ need not have a symmetric distribution:
Theorem 17.5.9.

for some random variable Θ taking values in the interval [−1/2, 1/2).
In
the nontrivial case where KZZ(0) > 0 the distribution function of Θ is fully
speciﬁed by KZZ.
(ii) If Θ is any random variable taking values in [−1/2, 1/2) and if α > 0, then
there exists a proper discrete-time WSS CSP

Chapter X § 3 Theorem 3.2), or (Feller, 1971, Chapter XIX, Section 6, Theorem 3).
Some authors refer to the mapping θ 	→Pr[Θ ≤θ] as the spectral distribution func-

Limits of Proper Complex Random Variables
Understanding limits is essential to understanding inﬁnite sums, and those will
appear when we discuss discrete convolutions and the response of discrete-time
ﬁlters to stochastic inputs (Chapter 31). Here we shall establish that the limit of
proper CRVs must also be proper and that this also holds for complex random
vectors. We begin with scalars.

17.6 Limits of Proper Complex Random Variables

Proposition 17.6.1. If the sequence Z1, Z2, . . . of proper complex random variables
converges to the CRV Z in the sense that
lim

|Z −Zn|2

(17.73)

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that
E

|Z|2

(17.74)
The proposition’s hypotheses guarantee that for any n ∈N the CRV Zn is proper
and hence, a fortiori,
E

|Zn|2
< ∞.
(17.75)
Expressing Z as Zn +(Z −Zn) we obtain from the Triangle Inequality for complex
random variables (Exercise 17.10) that
E

|Z|2

E[|Zn|2] +

which combines with (17.75) and (17.73) to establish (17.74).
We next prove that Z must be of zero mean. For every n ∈N the CRV Zn is
proper and hence
E[Zn] = 0.
(17.76)
This in combination with (17.73) implies that E[Z] must be zero, because
E

|Z −Zn|2
= |E[Z −Zn]|2 + Var[Z −Zn]
≥|E[Z −Zn]|2
= |E[Z]|2,
where in the last equality we used (17.76).
To conclude the proof that Z is proper, we next show that E[Z2] must be zero.
Since Zn is proper for every n ∈N,
E

n

= 0,
n ∈N.
(17.77)

where the third line follows from (17.77), the ﬁfth from the inequality |E[Z]| ≤
E[|Z|] (Exercise 17.3), and the sixth line from the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for
complex random variables (Exercise 17.9).
We will establish that E[Z2] must be zero by showing that the proposition’s hy-
potheses imply that, as n tends to inﬁnity, the RHS of (17.78) tends to zero. In
view of (17.73), we only need to show that E

|Zn|2
must be bounded in n. This
follows from the Triangle Inequality for complex random variables by expressing
Zn as Z + (Zn −Z) to obtain
E

|Zn|2

from which the desired boundedness follows using (17.74) and (17.73).
The above proposition can be easily extended to vectors by recalling that if αTZ is
proper for every deterministic vector α, then Z must be a proper complex random
vector (Proposition 17.4.2):
Proposition 17.6.2 (Limits of Proper Complex Random Vectors). If the sequence
of proper complex random n-vectors Z1, Z2, . . . converges to the complex random
n-vector Z in the sense that
lim
ν→∞E
%Z(m)
ν
−Z(m)2&
= 0,
m ∈{1, . . . , n}
(17.79)
(where Z(m)
ν
is the m-th component of Zν and Z(m) is the m-th component of Z),
then Z must be proper.
Proof. To establish that Z is proper it suﬃces to show that αTZ is proper for
every α ∈Cn (Proposition 17.4.2), which is what we now do. Let α ∈Cn be any
deterministic n-vector. Since linear functionals of proper complex random vectors
are proper CRVs (Proposition 17.4.2), the sequence αTZ1, αTZ2, . . . is a sequence
of proper CRVs. We will now argue that (17.79) implies that it converges to αTZ
in the sense that
lim
ν→∞E
%αTZν −αTZ
2&
= 0,
(17.80)
from which it will then follow using Proposition 17.6.1 that αTZ is proper.
To see that (17.79) implies (17.80), one can use the Triangle Inequality for complex
random variables (see Exercise 17.10 but extended to the sum of n CRVs) to obtain
that

This inequality demonstrates that (17.79) indeed implies (17.80), because (17.79)
implies that the RHS of the inequality tends to zero as ν tends to inﬁnity, and
hence (17.80) must hold by the Sandwich Theorem.

Chapter 18
Energy, Power, and PSD in QAM
18.1
Introduction
The calculations of the power and of the operational power spectral density in
QAM are not just repetitions of the analogous PAM calculations with complex
notation.
They contain two new elements that we shall try to highlight.
The
ﬁrst is the relationship between the power (as opposed to energy) in passband and
baseband, and the second is the fact that the energy and power in transmitting
the complex symbols {Cℓ} are only related to expectations of the form E[CℓC∗
ℓ′];
they are uninﬂuenced by those of the form E[CℓCℓ′].
The signal

X(t), t ∈R

(or X for short) that we consider is given by
X(t) = 2 Re

XBB(t) ei2πfct
,
t ∈R,
(18.1)
where
XBB(t) = A

ℓ
Cℓg(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R.
(18.2)
Here A > 0 is real; the symbols {Cℓ} are complex random variables; the pulse
shape g is an integrable complex function that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz; Ts is
positive; and fc > W/2. The range of the summation will depend on the modes
we discuss.
Our focus in this chapter is on X’s energy, power, and operational PSD. These
quantities are studied in Sections 18.2–18.4, albeit without all the ﬁne mathemat-
ical details. Those are provided in Sections 18.5 & 18.6, which are recommended
for the more mathematical readers. The deﬁnition of the operational PSD of com-
plex stochastic processes is very similar to the one of real stochastic processes
(Deﬁnition 15.3.1). It is given in Section 18.4 (Deﬁnition 18.4.1).
18.2
The Energy in QAM
As in our treatment in Chapter 14 of PAM, we begin with an analysis of the energy
in transmitting K IID random bits D1, . . . , DK.
We assume that the data bits
are mapped to N complex symbols C1, . . . , CN using a (K, N) binary-to-complex
block-encoder
enc: {0, 1}K →CN

Our interest is in the energy E in X, which is deﬁned by
E ≜E


.
(18.7)
Our assumption that the pulse shape g is bandlimited to W/2 Hz implies that
for every realization of the symbols {Cℓ}, the signal XBB(·) is also bandlimited
to W/2 Hz. And since we assume that fc > W/2, it follows from Theorem 7.6.10
that the energy in the passband signal X(·) is twice the energy in its baseband
representation XBB(·), i.e.,
E = 2E

(18.8)
We can thus compute the energy in X(·) by computing the energy in XBB(·) and
doubling the result. The energy of the baseband signal can be computed in much
the same way that the energy was computed in Section 14.2 for PAM. The only
diﬀerence is that the baseband signal is now complex:

(18.12)
Since g is an integrable function that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, it is also energy-
limited (Note 6.4.12). Consequently, by Proposition 11.2.2 (iv), we can express
the self-similarity function Rgg in (18.9) as the Inverse Fourier Transform of the
mapping f 	→|ˆg(f)|2:
Rgg(τ) =
 ∞

terms of the form E[CℓCℓ′] do not appear in this analysis.
18.3
The Power in QAM
In order to discuss the power in QAM we must consider the transmission of an
inﬁnite sequence of complex symbols

Cℓ

. To guarantee convergence, we shall
assume that the pulse shape g—in addition to being an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W/2 Hz—also satisﬁes the decay condition
|g(t)| ≤
β
1 + |t/Ts|1+α ,
t ∈R
(18.22)
for some α, β > 0.
Also, we shall only consider the transmission of bi-inﬁnite
sequences

Cℓ

that are bounded in the sense that there exists some γ > 0 such
that every realization of

Cℓ

satisﬁes
Cℓ
 ≤γ,
ℓ∈Z.
(18.23)
As for PAM, we shall treat three diﬀerent scenarios for the generation of

Cℓ

. In
the ﬁrst, we simply ignore the mechanism by which the sequence

Cℓ

is generated
and assume that it forms a wide-sense stationary complex stochastic process. In
the second, we assume bi-inﬁnite block encoding. And in the third we relax the
statistical assumptions and consider the case where the time shifts of g by integer
multiples of Ts are orthonormal. In all these cases the transmitted waveform is
given by
X(t) = 2 Re

XBB(t) ei2πfct

t ∈R,

18.3 The Power in QAM
345
It is tempting to derive the power in X(·) by using the complex version of the
PAM results of Section 14.5 to compute the power in XBB(·) and then doubling
the result. This turns out to be a valid approach, but its justiﬁcation requires some
work. The diﬃculty is that the powers are deﬁned as
lim
T→∞
1
2T E
5 T
−T
X2(t) dt
6
and
lim
T→∞
1
2T E
5 T
−T
XBB(t)
2 dt
6
,
and—Theorem 7.6.10 notwithstanding—
1
2T E
5 T
−T
X2(t) dt
6
̸= 2 1
2T E
5 T
−T
XBB(t)
2 dt
6
.
(18.26)
The reason we cannot claim equality in (18.26) is that t 	→X(t) I{|t| ≤T} is not
bandlimited around fc, so Theorem 7.6.10, which relates energies in passband and
baseband, is not applicable. Nevertheless, it turns out that the limits as T →∞of
the RHS and the LHS of (18.26) do agree:
lim
T→∞
1
2T E
5 T
−T
X2(t) dt
6
= 2 lim
T→∞
1
2T E
5 T
−T
XBB(t)
2 dt
6
.
(18.27)
Thus, the power in a QAM signal is, indeed, twice the power in its baseband
representation. This is stated more precisely in Theorem 18.5.2 and is proved in
Section 18.5. With the aid of (18.27) we can now readily compute the power in
QAM.
18.3.1

Cℓ

Is Zero-Mean and WSS
We next ignore the mechanism by which the symbols

Cℓ

are generated and merely
assume that they form a zero-mean WSS discrete-time CSP of autocovariance
function KCC:
E[Cℓ] = 0,
ℓ∈Z,
(18.28a)
E[Cℓ+mC∗
ℓ] = KCC(m) ,
m, ℓ∈Z.
(18.28b)
The calculation of the RHS of (18.27) is very similar to the analogous computation
in Section 14.5.1 for PAM. The only diﬀerence is that here XBB(·) is complex. As
in Section 14.5.1, we begin by computing the energy in a length-Ts interval:

(which can be justiﬁed by extending Theorem 14.6.4 to the case where the pulse
shape and the symbols are complex).
18.3.2

The second scenario we consider is when

is generated, as in Section 14.5.2, by
applying a binary-to-complex block-encoder enc: {0, 1}K →CN to bi-inﬁnite IID


. As in Section 14.5.2, we assume that the encoder, when fed IID
random bits, produces symbols of zero mean.
By extending the results of Section 14.5.2 to complex pulse shapes and complex
symbols, we obtain that the power in XBB(·) is given by:

Energy, Power, and PSD in QAM
Proof. Follows from Theorem 18.5.2 and by noting that Theorem 14.6.5 also ex-
tends to the case where the pulse shape and the symbols are complex.
18.3.3
Time Shifts of Pulse Shape Are Orthonormal
We ﬁnally address the third scenario where the time shifts of the pulse shape by
integer multiples of Ts are orthonormal. This situation is very prevalent in Digital
Communications and allows for signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations. In this setting we denote
the pulse shape by φ(·) and state the orthonormality as

ℓ, ℓ′ ∈Z.

18.4 The Operational PSD of QAM Signals

18.4
The Operational PSD of QAM Signals
We shall compute the operational PSD of the QAM signal

X(t), t ∈R

(18.24) by
relating it to the operational PSD of the complex signal

XBB(t), t ∈R

(18.25)
and by then computing the operational PSD of the latter using techniques similar
to the ones we employed in Chapter 15 in our study of the operational PSD of real
PAM signals. But ﬁrst we must deﬁne the operational PSD of complex stochastic
processes. The deﬁnition is very similar to that for real stochastic processes (Deﬁ-
nition 15.3.1), but there are two issues to note. The ﬁrst is that we do not require
that the operational PSD be a symmetric function, and the second is that we allow
for ﬁlters of complex impulse response.
Deﬁnition 18.4.1 (Operational PSD of a CSP). We say that a CSP

Z(t), t ∈R

is of operational power spectral density SZZ if

Z(t), t ∈R

is a measurable
CSP;1 the mapping SZZ : R →R is integrable; and for every integrable complex-
valued function h: R →C the power of the convolution of

Z(t), t ∈R

and h is
given by
Power in Z ⋆h =
 ∞
−∞
SZZ(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df.
(18.43)
By Lemma 15.3.5 (i) the PSD is unique:
Note 18.4.2 (The Operational PSD Is Unique). The operational PSD of a CSP
is unique in the sense that if a CSP is of two diﬀerent operational power spectral
densities, then the two must be indistinguishable.
The relationship between the operational PSD of the real QAM signal

X(t)

(18.24) and of the CSP

XBB(t)

(18.25) turns out to be very simple. Indeed,
subject to the conditions that are made precise in Theorem 18.6.6, if the baseband
CSP

XBB(t)

is of operational PSD SBB, then the real QAM SP

X(t)

is of
operational PSD SXX, where
SXX(f) = SBB

|f| −fc

,
f ∈R.
(18.44)
This result is proved in Section 18.6 and relies heavily on the fact that g is band-
limited to W/2 Hz and that fc > W/2. Here we shall only derive it heuristically
and then see how to apply it.
Recalling the deﬁnition of the operational PSD of a real SP (Deﬁnition 15.3.1), we
note that in order to derive (18.44) we need to show that its RHS is an integrable
symmetric function and that
Power in X ⋆h =
 ∞
−∞
ˆh(f)
2 SBB

|f| −fc

df,
(18.45)
whenever h: R →R is integrable. The integrability of f 	→SBB(|f| −fc) follows
directly from the integrability of SBB(·). The symmetry is obvious because the RHS
1A complex stochastic processes is said to be measurable if its real and imaginary parts are
measurable real stochastic processes.

Energy, Power, and PSD in QAM
of (18.44) depends on f only via |f|. Our plan for computing the power in X ⋆h
is to ﬁrst use the results of Section 7.6.7 to express the baseband representation
of X ⋆h in the form XBB ⋆h′
BB, where h′
BB is the baseband representation of the
result of passing h through a unit-gain bandpass ﬁlter of bandwidth W around
the carrier frequency fc. Using the relationship between power in passband and
baseband, this will allow us to express the power in X ⋆h as twice the power in
XBB ⋆h′
BB. Expressing the power in the latter using the operational PSD SBB(·)
of XBB will allow us to complete the calculation of the power in X ⋆h.
Before executing this plan, we pause here to heuristically argue that, loosely speak-
ing, the condition that g is bandlimited to W/2 Hz implies that we may assume
that
SBB(f) = 0,
|f| > W
2 .
(18.46)
For a precise statement of this result, see Proposition 18.6.3 in Section 18.6.2. The
intuition behind this statement is that, since g is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, in some
loose sense, all the power of the signal XBB is contained in the band |f| ≤W/2.
To heuristically justify (18.46), we shall show that if SBB(·) is an operational PSD
for

XBB(t)

, then so is the mapping f 	→SBB(f) I{|f| ≤W/2}. This follows by
noting that for every h: R →C in L1

from which the result follows from the uniqueness (to within indistinguishability)
of the operational PSD (Note 18.4.2).
Here the ﬁrst equality follows from the
deﬁnition of XBB (18.25); the second because convolving a PAM signal of pulse
shape g (in our case complex) with h is tantamount to replacing the pulse shape g
with the new pulse shape g ⋆h (see the derivation of (15.19) in Section 15.4 which
extends verbatim to the complex case); the third because, by assumption, g is
bandlimited to W/2 Hz; the fourth by the associativity of convolution (see Theo-
rem 5.6.1, which, strictly speaking, is not applicable here because LPFW/2 is not
integrable); the ﬁfth because replacing the pulse shape g by g ⋆


is
tantamount to convolving the PAM signal with (h ⋆LPFW/2); the sixth from our

assumption that SBB(·) is an operational PSD for XBB (and by ignoring the fact
that h ⋆LPFW/2 need not be integrable); and the seventh by trivial algebra.
Having established (18.46), we are now ready to compute the power in X ⋆h.
Using the results of Section 7.6.7 we obtain that for every integrable h: R →R,
the baseband representation of X ⋆h is given by XBB ⋆h′
BB where h′
BB : R →C is
the baseband representation of the result of passing h through a unit-gain bandpass
ﬁlter of bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc:
ˆh′
BB(f) = ˆh(f + fc) I{|f| ≤W/2},
f ∈R.

And since the power in passband is twice the power in baseband, we conclude that

where the ﬁrst equality follows from (18.27) because XBB ⋆h′
BB is the baseband
representation of X⋆h; the second holds because XBB is of operational PSD SBB(·);
the third by (18.47); the fourth by (18.46); the ﬁfth by changing the integration
variable to ˜f ≜f + fc; the sixth because h is real so its Fourier Transform must
be conjugate-symmetric; the seventh by changing the integration variable in the
second integral to f ′ ≜−˜f; the eighth by the linearity of integration; and the ﬁnal
equality by (18.46) and the assumption that fc > W/2. This establishes (18.45)
and thus concludes the proof of (18.44).
We next apply (18.44) to calculate the operational PSD of QAM in two scenarios:
when the complex symbols

Energy, Power, and PSD in QAM
To use (18.44) we ﬁrst need to compute the operational PSD of the CSP XBB. This
is straightforward. As in Section 15.4.2, we note that XBB ⋆h has the same form
as (18.25) with the pulse shape g replaced by g ⋆h. Consequently, by substituting
the FT of g ⋆h for the FT of g in (18.32),2 we obtain that


can be found in Section 18.6.5. We draw
the reader’s attention to the fact that the proof that we gave for the real case in
Section 15.5 is not directly applicable to the complex case because that proof relied
on Theorem 25.14.1 (Wiener-Khinchin), which we prove in Section 25.14 only for
real WSS stochastic processes.3
Figure 18.1 depicts the relationship between the pulse shape g and the operational
PSD of the QAM signal for the case where KCC(m) = I{m = 0} for every m ∈Z.
18.4.2
The Operational PSD of QAM in Bi-Inﬁnite Block-Mode
The operational PSD of QAM in bi-inﬁnite block-mode can also be computed
using (18.44).
All we need is the operational PSD of

XBB(t)

, which can be
computed from (18.36) as follows. As in Section 15.4.2, we note that XBB ⋆h has
the same form as (18.25) with the pulse shape g replaced by g ⋆h. Consequently,
by substituting the FT of g ⋆h for the FT of g in (18.36), we obtain that

In this section we formulate conditions under which (18.27) holds, i.e., under which

Proposition 18.5.1 (Triangle Inequality for Stochastic Processes). Let

This also holds when a is replaced with −∞and/or b is replaced with +∞.
Proof. Replace all integrals in the proof of (4.14) with expectations of integrals.
We can now state the main result of this section relating the power in passband to
the power in baseband.

The rest of this section is dedicated to proving this theorem.
To simplify the
notation we begin by showing that it suﬃces to prove the result for the case where
Ts = 1. If Ts > 0 is not necessarily equal to 1, then we deﬁne for every t ∈R,
˜g(t) = g(tTs),
˜W = W Ts,
˜fc = fcTs,
and note that g is bandlimited to W/2 Hz if, and only if, ˜g is bandlimited to ˜W/2
Hz; that

fc ≥W/2

⇐⇒
 ˜fc ≥˜W/2

;
and that g satisﬁes the decay condition (18.22) if, and only if,
|˜g(t)| ≤
β
1 + |t|1+α ,
t ∈R
for some positive α and β.
By deﬁning τ ≜t/Ts we obtain that

Having established that it suﬃces to prove the theorem for Ts = 1, we assume for
the remainder of this section that Ts = 1, so the decay condition (18.22) can be
rewritten as
|g(t)| ≤
β
1 + |t|1+α ,
t ∈R.
(18.58)
As in the proof of Theorem 14.5.2, we shall simplify notation and assume that—in
calculating power as the limiting ratio of the energy in the interval [−T, T ] to the
length of the interval—T is restricted to the positive integers. The justiﬁcation is
identical to the one we gave in proving Theorem 14.5.2; see (14.52).

Energy, Power, and PSD in QAM
We shall ﬁnd it convenient to introduce an additional subscript “w” to indicate
“windowing.” Thus, if we deﬁne XBB(·) as
XBB(t) =

ℓ∈Z
Cℓg(t −ℓ),
t ∈R,
then its windowed version XBB,w(·) is given by
XBB,w(t) =

ℓ∈Z
Cℓg(t −ℓ) I{|t| ≤T},
t ∈R.
Similarly XPB,w(·) is the windowed version of the SP
XPB(t) = 2 Re
	 
ℓ∈Z
Cℓg(t −ℓ) ei2πfct

,
t ∈R,
and gℓ,w is the windowed version of
gℓ: t 	→g(t −ℓ),
ℓ∈Z.
(18.59)
We can now express the power in baseband as the limit, as T tends to inﬁnity, of
E
%
∥XBB,w∥2
2
&
/(2T), and the power in passband as the limit of E
%
∥XPB,w∥2
2
&
/(2T).
Note that, since the function I{·} is real-valued,
XPB,w(t) = 2 Re

XBB,w(t) ei2πfct
,
t ∈R.
(18.60)
But (18.60) notwithstanding, the energy in XPB,w need not be twice the en-
ergy in XBB,w because the signal XBB,w—unlike its unwindowed version XBB—is
not bandlimited. It is time-limited, and as such cannot be bandlimited (Theo-
rem 6.8.2).
The diﬃculty in proving the theorem is in relating the energy in XPB,w to the
energy in XBB,w and, speciﬁcally, in showing that the diﬀerence between half the
energy in XPB,w and the energy in XBB,w, when normalized by 2T, tends to zero as
T tends to inﬁnity. Aiding us in this is the following lemma relating the energy in
passband to the energy in baseband for signals that are not necessarily bandlimited.
Lemma 18.5.3. Let z be a complex energy-limited signal that is not necessarily
bandlimited, and consider the real signal x: t 	→2 Re

(18.62)
Proof. Expressing the FT of x in terms of the FT of z, we obtain that for every
f ∈R outside a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero,
ˆx(f) I{f ≥0}
= ˆz(f −fc) I{f ≥0} + ˆz∗(−f −fc) I{f ≥0}
= ˆz(f −fc) + ˆz∗(−f −fc) I{f ≥0} −ˆz(f −fc) I{f < 0}.

We next consider the integral over f of the squared magnitude of the LHS and of
the RHS of (18.63). Since x is real, its FT is conjugate-symmetric so, by Parseval’s
Theorem, the integral of the squared magnitude of the LHS of (18.63) is 1
2 ∥x∥2
2.
The integral of the squared magnitude of the ﬁrst term on the RHS of (18.63) is
given by ∥z∥2
2. Finally, the integral of the squared magnitude of each of the last
two terms on the RHS of (18.63) is ϵ2 and, since they are orthogonal, the integral
of the squared magnitude of their sum is 2ϵ2. The result now follows from the
Triangle Inequality (4.14).
Applying Lemma 18.5.3 with the substitution of xBB,w for z and of xPB,w for x
we obtain upon noting that fc > W/2 that, in order to establish the theorem, it
suﬃces to show that the “out-of-band energy” term
e2 ≜

|f|≥W/2
ˆxBB,w(f)
2 df
(18.64)
satisﬁes
lim
T→∞

T e2 = 0,
(18.65)
with the convergence being uniform. That is, we need to show that e2/T is upper-
bounded by some function of α, β, γ, and T that converges to zero as T tends to
inﬁnity with α, β, γ held ﬁxed. Aiding us in the calculation of the out-of-band
energy is the following lemma.
Lemma 18.5.4. Let x be an energy-limited signal and let W ≥0.
(i) If u is any energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, then

|f|≥W/2
|ˆx(f)|2 df ≤∥x −u∥2
2 .
(18.66)
(ii) In particular,

|f|≥W/2
|ˆx(f)|2 df ≤∥x∥2
2 .
(18.67)
Proof. Part (ii) follows from Parseval’s Theorem. Part (i) follows by noting that
if u is an energy-limited signal that is bandlimited to W/2 Hz, then the Fourier
Transforms of x and x −u are indistinguishable for frequencies f that satisfy
|f| ≥W/2. Consequently,

|f|≥W/2
|ˆx(f)|2 df =

|f|≥W/2
|ˆx(f) −ˆu(f)|2 df
≤∥x −u∥2
2 ,
where the inequality follows by applying Part (ii) to the signal x −u.

(18.73)
Since the integer ν ≥2 is arbitrary, it follows from (18.73) that, to establish (18.65)
and to thus complete the proof of Theorem 18.5.2, it suﬃces to show that for every
ﬁxed integer ν ≥2,

(18.76)
We thus conclude the theorem’s proof by establishing (18.74), (18.75), and (18.76).
We begin with the easiest, namely (18.75).
To establish (18.75) we recall the
deﬁnition of e1 (18.72) & (18.70) and use the Triangle Inequality to obtain

where the second inequality follows from (18.23) and from Lemma 18.5.4 (ii), and
where the ﬁnal inequality holds because windowing cannot increase energy, so
∥gℓ,w∥2 ≤∥gℓ∥2, with ∥gℓ∥2 being equal to ∥g∥2 by (18.59). Inequality (18.77)
establishes (18.75).
Having established (18.75), we next turn to proving (18.74). The proof is quite
similar except that, instead of using Part (ii) of Lemma 18.5.4, we use Part (i) with
the substitutions of gℓ,w for x and of gℓfor u to obtain

A Formal Account of the PSD in Baseband and Passband
In this section we justify the derivations of Section 18.4.
18.6.1
On Limits of Convolutions
We begin with a lemma that justiﬁes the swapping of inﬁnite summation and
convolution. As a corollary we establish conditions under which feeding a (real or
complex) PAM signal of pulse shape g to a stable ﬁlter of impulse response h is
tantamount to replacing its pulse shape g with the new pulse shape g ⋆h.
Lemma 18.6.1. Let s1, s2, . . . be a sequence of measurable functions from R to C
satisfying the following two conditions:
1) The sequence is uniformly bounded in the sense that there exists some positive
number σ∞such that
sℓ(t)
 ≤σ∞,

t ∈R,
ℓ= 1, 2, . . .


(18.84)
2) The sequence converges to some function s uniformly over compact sets in
the sense that for every ﬁxed ξ > 0
lim

|t|≤ξ

 = 0.

Then for every h ∈L1,

ϵ > 0 there exists some L0 ∈N (depending on ϵ) such that
(sℓ⋆h

(t0) −(s ⋆h

(t0)
 < ϵ,
ℓ≥L0.

To that end note that our assumption that h is integrable implies that there exists
some ξ > 0 such that

And when we apply our assumption that the sequence s1, s2, . . . converges to s
uniformly over compact sets to the compact interval [t0 −ξ, t0 + ξ], we obtain that
there exists some L0 (depending on ϵ, t0, and ξ) such that

operational PSD of XBB is zero at frequencies outside the band [−W/2, W/2].

From (18.92) it is just a technicality to show that the nonnegative function SBB(·)
must be zero at all frequencies |f| > W/2 outside a set of Lebesgue measure
zero. Indeed, if, in order to reach a contradiction, we assume that SBB(·) is not
indistinguishable from the all-zero function in some interval [a, b], where a and b
are such that W/2 < a < b, then picking h as an integrable function such that
ˆh(f) is zero for |f| ≤W/2 and such that ˆh(f) = 1 for a ≤f ≤b would yield
a contradiction to (18.92). (An example of such a function h is the IFT of the
shifted-trapezoid mapping

f ∈R,
which is a frequency shifted version of the function we encountered in (7.16) and
(7.18).)
The assumption that SBB(·) is not indistinguishable from the all-zero
function in some interval [a, b] where a < b < −W/2 can be similarly contradicted.
To complete the proof we thus need to justify (18.91).
This follows from two
observations. The ﬁrst is that, by Corollary 18.6.2, for every h ∈L1

18.6.3
On the Deﬁnition of the Operational PSD
In order to demonstrate that

Z(t), t ∈R

is of operational PSD SZZ, one has
to show that (18.43) holds for every function h: R →C in L1 (Deﬁnition 18.4.1).
It turns out that it suﬃces to establish (18.43) only for functions that are in a
subset of L1, provided that the subset is suﬃciently rich. This result will allow
us to consider only functions h of compact support. To make this result precise
we need the following deﬁnition. We say that the set H is a dense subset of L1
if H is a subset of L1 such that for every h ∈L1 there exists a sequence h1, h2, . . .
of elements of H such that limν→∞∥h −hν∥1 = 0. An example of a dense subset
of L1 is the subset of functions of compact support, where a function h: R →C is
said to be of compact support if there exists some Δ > 0 such that
h(t) = 0,
|t| ≥Δ.
(18.95)
Lemma 18.6.4 (On Functions of Compact Support).
(i) The set of integrable functions of compact support is a dense subset of L1.
(ii) If h is of compact support and if g satisﬁes the decay condition (18.22) with
parameters α, β, Ts > 0, then g ⋆h also satisﬁes this decay condition with the
same parameters α and Ts but with a possibly diﬀerent parameter β′.
Proof. We begin with Part (i). Given any integrable function h (not necessarily
of compact support) we deﬁne the sequence of integrable functions of compact
support h1, h2, . . . by hν : t 	→h(t) I{|t| ≤ν} for every ν ∈N. It is then just a
technicality to show that ∥h −hν∥1 converges to zero. (This can be shown using
the Dominated Convergence Theorem, because at every t ∈R we have that hν(t)
converges to h(t) with |hν(t)| ≤|h(t)| and h being integrable.)
We next prove Part (ii). Let g satisfy the decay condition (18.22) with the positive
parameters α, β, Ts, and let Δ > 0 be such that (18.95) is satisﬁed. We shall prove
the lemma by showing that

Both (18.98) and (18.99) follow from the bound

as follows. Bound (18.98) simply follows by using (18.22) to upper-bound |g(t)|
by β. And Bound (18.99) follows by using (18.22) to upper-bound |g(t)| for |t| ≥Δ

Having established (18.98) and (18.99), we now complete the proof by showing
that the RHS of (18.96) upper-bounds the RHS of (18.98) whenever |t| ≤2Δ, and
that it upper-bounds the RHS of (18.99) for |t| > 2Δ. That the RHS of (18.96)
upper-bounds the RHS of (18.98) whenever |t| ≤2Δ follows because

And that the RHS of (18.96) upper-bounds the RHS of (18.99) whenever |t| > 2Δ
follows because the term 1 + (2Δ/Ts)1+α is larger than one.

Energy, Power, and PSD in QAM
Proof. Let h be an element of L1 (but not necessarily of H) for which we would
like to prove (18.101). Since H is a dense subset of L1, there exists a sequence
h1, h2, . . . of elements of H
hν ∈H,
ν = 1, 2, . . .
(18.102)
such that
lim
ν→∞∥h −hν∥1 = 0.
(18.103)
We shall prove that (18.101) holds for h by justifying the calculation

(18.106)
The justiﬁcation of (18.105) is that, by (18.102), each of the functions hν is in H,
and the proposition’s hypothesis guarantees that (18.101) holds for such functions.
The justiﬁcation of (18.106) is a bit technical. It is based on noting that (18.103)
implies (by Theorem 6.2.11 (i) with the substitution of h −hν for x) that
lim
ν→∞
ˆhν(f) = ˆh(f),
f ∈R
(18.107)
and by then using the Dominated Convergence Theorem to justify the swapping of
the limit and integral. Indeed, (by Theorem 6.2.11 (i)) for every ν ∈N, the function
f 	→S(f) ˆhν(f) is bounded by the function f 	→

supν ∥hν∥1

S(f), which is
integrable because S(·) is integrable (by the proposition’s hypothesis) and because
the integrability of h and (18.103) imply that the supremum is ﬁnite as can be
veriﬁed using the Triangle Inequality by writing hν as h −(h −hν).
We now complete the proof by justifying (18.104). Since Z⋆hν = Z⋆h−Z⋆(h−hν),
it follows from the Triangle Inequality for Stochastic Processes (Proposition 18.5.1)

stochastic process

(18.111)
Proof. The hypothesis that SBB(·) is integrable clearly implies that SPB(·), as
deﬁned in (18.110), is integrable and symmetric. It remains to show that if (18.109)
holds for every complex hc ∈L1, then (18.111) must hold for every real hr ∈L1.
Since the set of integrable functions of compact support is a dense subset of L1
(Lemma 18.6.4 (i)), it follows from Proposition 18.6.5 that it suﬃces to establish
(18.111) for real functions hr that are of compact support.
Let hr be such a
function. The following calculation demonstrates that passing the QAM signal X
through a ﬁlter of impulse response hr is tantamount to replacing its pulse shape g
with the pulse shape consisting of the convolution of g with the complex signal

where the ﬁfth equality follows by deﬁning the mapping

(18.113)
Note that by (18.113)
ˆhc(f) = ˆhr(f + fc),
f ∈R.
(18.114)
It follows from (18.112) that X⋆hr has the form of a QAM signal with pulse shape
g⋆hc. We note that, because g (by hypothesis) satisﬁes the decay condition (18.22)
and because the fact that hr is of compact support implies by (18.113) that hc is
also of compact support, it follows from Lemma 18.6.4 (ii) that the pulse shape

and the seventh from the conjugate symmetry of ˆhr(·).
Since hr was an arbitrary integrable real function of compact support, (18.116)
establishes (18.111) for all such functions.

On the Operational PSD in Baseband
In the calculation of the operational PSD of the QAM signal

X(t)

via (18.44)
(which is formally stated as Corollary 18.6.7) we needed the operational PSD of
the CSP

XBB(t)

of (18.25). In this section we justify the calculations of this
operational PSD that lead to Theorems 18.4.3 and 18.4.4. Speciﬁcally, we show:
Proposition 18.6.8 (Operational PSD of a Complex PAM Signal). Let the CSP

XBB(t), t ∈R

be given by (18.25), where A ≥0, Ts > 0, and where g is a
complex Borel measurable function satisfying the decay condition (18.22) for some
constants α, β > 0.
(i) If

Cℓ

is a bounded, zero-mean, WSS CSP of autocovariance function KCC,
i.e., if it satisﬁes (18.23) and (18.28), then the CSP

XBB(t), t ∈R

is of
operational PSD SBB(·) as given in (18.49).
(ii) If

Cℓ

is produced in bi-inﬁnite block-mode from IID random bits using an
encoder enc: {0, 1}K →CN that produces zero-mean symbols from IID ran-
dom bits, then

XBB(t), t ∈R

is of operational PSD SBB(·) as given in
(18.52).
Proof. We have all the ingredients that are needed to justify our derivations of
(18.49) and (18.52). All that remains is to piece them together. Let h be any
complex integrable function of compact support. Then

function g ⋆h satisﬁes the decay condition (18.96) for some β′ > 0.

(Lemma 18.6.4 (i)) and from Proposition 18.6.5 that (18.119) must hold for ev-


XBB(t), t ∈R

is of operational PSD SBB(·) as given

The proof of Part (ii) is very similar except that we compute the RHS of (18.118)
using (18.36) with the substitution of g ⋆h for the pulse shape.

(iii) Show that if we express the rate ρ of the block-encoder in both cases in bits per

Chapter 19
The Univariate Gaussian Distribution
19.1
Introduction
In many communication scenarios the noise is modeled as a Gaussian stochastic
process. This is sometimes justiﬁed by invoking a Central Limit Theorem, which
demonstrates that many small independent disturbances add up to a stochastic
process that is approximately Gaussian.
Another justiﬁcation is mathematical
convenience: while Gaussian processes may seem daunting at ﬁrst, they are actually
well understood and often amenable to analysis. Finally, particularly in wireline
communications, the Gaussian model is justiﬁed because it leads to robust results
and to good engineering design.
For other scenarios, e.g., fast-moving wireless
mobile communications, more intricate models are needed.
Rather than starting immediately with the deﬁnition and analysis of Gaussian
stochastic processes, we shall take the more moderate approach and start by ﬁrst
discussing Gaussian random variables.
Building on that, we shall later discuss
Gaussian random vectors in Chapter 23, and only then introduce continuous-time
Gaussian stochastic processes in Chapter 25.
19.2
Standard Gaussian Random Variables
We begin with a special kind of Gaussian: the standard Gaussian.
Deﬁnition 19.2.1 (Standard Gaussian). We say that the random variable W is a
standard Gaussian or that it has a standard Gaussian distribution, if its
density function fW (·) is given by
fW (w) =
1
√
2π e−w2
2 ,
w ∈R.
(19.1)
This density is depicted in Figure 19.1. For this deﬁnition to be meaningful, the
RHS of (19.1) had better be a valid density function, i.e., be nonnegative and
integrate to one. This is indeed the case. In fact, the RHS of (19.1) is positive,
and it integrates to one because, as we next show,

from Cartesian to polar coordinates:

r ≥0,

dw dv = r dr dϕ;
the fourth because the integrand does not depend on ϕ; the ﬁfth because the
derivative of −e−r2/2 is r e−r2/2; and where the ﬁnal equality follows by direct
evaluation.
Note that the density of a standard Gaussian random variable is symmetric (19.1).
Consequently, if W is a standard Gaussian, then so is −W. This symmetry also
establishes that the expectation of a standard Gaussian is zero. The variance of a

Gaussian Random Variables
We next deﬁne a Gaussian (not necessarily standard) random variable as the result
of applying an aﬃne transformation to a standard Gaussian.
Deﬁnition 19.3.1 (Centered Gaussians and Gaussians). We say that a random
variable X is a centered Gaussian or that it has a centered Gaussian distri-
bution if it can be written in the form
X = aW
(19.3)
for some deterministic a ∈R and for some standard Gaussian W. We say that
the random variable X is Gaussian or that it has a Gaussian distribution if
X = aW + b
(19.4)
for some deterministic a, b ∈R and for some standard Gaussian W.
Note 19.3.2. We do not preclude a from being zero. The case a = 0 leads to X
being deterministically equal to b. We thus include the deterministic random vari-
ables in the family of Gaussian random variables.
Note 19.3.3. The family of Gaussian random variables is closed with respect to
aﬃne transformations: if X is Gaussian and α, β ∈R are deterministic, then
αX + β is also Gaussian.
Proof. Since X is Gaussian, it can be written as X = aW + b, where W is a
standard Gaussian. Consequently
αX + β = α(aW + b) + β
= (αa)W + (αb + β),
which has the form a′W + b′ for some deterministic a′, b′ ∈R.
If (19.4) holds, then the random variables on its RHS and LHS must have the same
mean. The mean of a standard Gaussian is zero, so the mean of the RHS of (19.4)
is b. The LHS is of mean E[X], and we thus conclude that in the representation

376
The Univariate Gaussian Distribution
(19.4) the deterministic constant b is uniquely determined by the mean of X, and
in fact,
b = E[X] .
Similarly, since the variance of a standard Gaussian is one, the variance of the RHS
of (19.4) is a2. And since the variance of the LHS is Var[X], we conclude that
a2 = Var[X] .
Up to its sign, the deterministic constant a in the representation (19.4) is thus also
unique.
Based on the above, one might mistakenly think that for any given mean μ and
variance σ2 there are two diﬀerent Gaussian distributions corresponding to
σW + μ,
and
−σW + μ,
(19.5)
where W is a standard Gaussian. This, however, is not the case:
Note 19.3.4. There is only one Gaussian distribution of a given mean and variance.
Proof. This can be seen in two diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst is to note that the two
representations in (19.5) lead to the same distribution, because the standard Gaus-
sian W has a symmetric distribution, so σW and −σW have the same distribution.
The second is based on computing the density of σW + μ and showing that it is a
symmetric function of σ; see (19.6) ahead.
Having established that there is only one Gaussian distribution of a given mean μ
and variance σ2, we denote it by
N

μ, σ2
and set out to study its density. Since the distribution does not depend on the
sign of σ, it is customary to require that σ be nonnegative and to refer to it as the
standard deviation. Thus, σ2 is the variance and σ is the standard deviation.
If σ2 = 0, then the Gaussian distribution is deterministic with mean μ and has
no density.1
If σ2 > 0, then the density can be computed from the density of
the standard Gaussian distribution as follows. If X ∼N

μ, σ2
, then X has the
same distribution as μ + σW, where W is a standard Gaussian, because both X
and μ + σW are of mean μ and variance σ2 (W is zero-mean and unit-variance);
both are Gaussian (Note 19.3.3); and Gaussians of identical means and variances
have identical distributions (Note 19.3.4). The density of X is thus identical to the
density of μ + σW. The density of the latter can be computed from the density
of W (19.1) to obtain that the density of a N

μ, σ2
Gaussian random variable of
positive variance is

2πσ2 e−(x−μ)2
2σ2 ,
x ∈R.
(19.6)
This density is depicted in Figure 19.2. To derive the density of μ + σW from
1Some would say that the density of a deterministic random variable is given by Dirac’s Delta,
but we prefer not to use generalized functions in this book.

that of W, we have used the fact that if X = g(W), where g(·) is a deterministic
continuously diﬀerentiable function whose derivative never vanishes (in our case
g(w) = μ + σw) and where W is of density fW (·) (in our case (19.1)), then the
density fX(·) of X is given by:

if ξ satisﬁes x = g(ξ),
(19.7)
where g′(ξ) denotes the derivative of g(·) at ξ. (For a more formal multivariate
version of this fact see Theorem 17.3.4.)
Since the family of Gaussian random variables is closed under deterministic aﬃne
transformations (Note 19.3.3), it follows that if X ∼N

μ, σ2
with σ2 > 0, then
(X −μ)/σ is also a Gaussian random variable. Since it is of zero mean and of
unit variance, it follows that it must be a standard Gaussian, because there is only
one Gaussian distribution of zero mean and unit variance (Note 19.3.4). We thus
conclude that for σ2 > 0 and arbitrary μ ∈R,

Q(α)
Figure 19.3: Q(α) is the area to the right of α under the standard Gaussian density
plot. Here it is represented by the shaded area.
There is, alas, no closed-form expression for this integral. To handle such expres-
sions we next introduce the Q-function.
19.4
The Q-Function
The Q-function maps every α ∈R to the probability that a standard Gaussian
exceeds it:
Deﬁnition 19.4.1 (The Q-Function). The Q-function is deﬁned by
Q(α) ≜

 ∞

α ∈R.
(19.9)
For a graphical interpretation of this integral see Figure 19.3.
Since the Q-function is a well-tabulated function, we are usually happy when we can
express answers to various questions using this function. The CDF of a standard
Gaussian W can be expressed using the Q-function as follows:
FW (w) = Pr[W ≤w]
= 1 −Pr[W ≥w]
= 1 −Q(w),
w ∈R,
(19.10)
where the second equality follows because the standard Gaussian has a density,
so Pr[W = w] = 0. Similarly, with the aid of the Q-function we can express the
probability that a standard Gaussian W lies in some given interval [a, b]:
Pr[a ≤W ≤b] = Pr[W ≥a] −Pr[W ≥b]
= Q(a) −Q(b),
a ≤b.

(19.12b)
The Q-function is usually only tabulated for nonnegative arguments, because the
standard Gaussian density (19.1) is symmetric: if W ∼N(0, 1) then, by the sym-
metry of its density,
Pr[W ≥−α] = Pr[W ≤α]
= 1 −Pr[W ≥α],
α ∈R.
Consequently, as illustrated in Figure 19.4,
Q(α) + Q(−α) = 1,
α ∈R,
(19.13)
and it suﬃces to tabulate the Q-function for nonnegative arguments. Note that,
by (19.13),
Q(0) = 1

Consider the probability of the event “X ≥0 and Y ≥α” where α ≥0. Since the
two random variables are independent, it follows that

We next describe various approximations for the Q-function. We are particularly
interested in its value for large arguments.2
Since Q(α) is the probability that
a standard Gaussian exceeds α, it follows that limα→∞Q(α) = 0. Thus, large
arguments to the Q-function correspond to small values of the Q-function. The

value at ϕ = π/2. We shall see an alternative proof in Section 20.10.

(19.22)
Note that this identity is meaningless when α ≤0, because in this case the inte-
grand is not integrable. For example, if α < 0, then the integrand tends to inﬁnity
as |x| tends to ∞. If α = 0 and β ̸= 0, then the integrand tends to inﬁnity either
as x tends to +∞or as x tends to −∞(depending on the sign of β). Finally, if
both α and β are zero, then the integrand is 1, which is not integrable. Note also
that, by considering the change of variable u ≜−x, one can verify that the sign
of β on the LHS of this identity is immaterial.

The Characteristic Function of Gaussians
19.7.1
The Characteristic Function
Recall that the Characteristic Function ΦX(·) of a random variable X is deﬁned
for every ϖ ∈R by
ΦX(ϖ) = E

eiϖX
=
 ∞
−∞
fX(x) eiϖx dx,
where the second equality holds if X has density fX(·). The second equality demon-
strates that the characteristic function is related to the Fourier Transform of the
density function but, by convention, there are no 2π’s, and the complex exponential
is not conjugated. If we allow for complex arguments to the MGF (by performing
an analytic continuation), then the characteristic function can be viewed as the
MGF evaluated on the imaginary axis:
ΦX(ϖ) = MX(iϖ),
ϖ ∈R.
(19.26)
Some of the properties of the characteristic function are summarized next.
Proposition 19.7.1 (On the Characteristic Function). Let X be a random variable
of characteristic function ΦX(·).
(i) If E[Xn] < ∞for some n ∈N, then ΦX(·) is diﬀerentiable n times and the
ν-th moment of X is related to the ν-th derivative of ΦX(·) at zero via the
relation

(ii) Two random variables of identical characteristic functions must have the
same distribution.
(iii) If X and Y are independent random variables of characteristic functions
ΦX(·) and ΦY (·), then the characteristic function ΦX+Y (·) of their sum is
given by the product of their characteristic functions:

Moments
Since the standard Gaussian density decays faster than exponentially, it possesses
moments of all orders. Those can be computed from the characteristic function
(19.29) using Proposition 19.7.1 (i) by repeated diﬀerentiation. Using this approach
we obtain that the moments of a standard Gaussian are

19.7.3
Sums of Independent Gaussians
Using the characteristic function we next show:
Proposition 19.7.2 (The Sum of Two Independent Gaussians Is Gaussian). The
sum of two independent Gaussian random variables is a Gaussian RV.5
Proof. Let X ∼N

be independent. By (19.29),
ΦX(ϖ) = eiϖμx−1
2 ϖ2σ2
x,
ϖ ∈R,
ΦY (ϖ) = eiϖμy−1
2 ϖ2σ2
y,
ϖ ∈R.
Since the characteristic function of the sum of two independent random variables
is equal to the product of their characteristic functions (19.28),
ΦX+Y (ϖ) = ΦX(ϖ) ΦY (ϖ)
= eiϖμx−1
2 ϖ2σ2
x eiϖμy−1
2 ϖ2σ2
y
= eiϖ(μx+μy)−1
2 ϖ2(σ2
x+σ2
y),
ϖ ∈R.
3It does require a (small) leap of faith to accept that (19.25) also holds for complex θ. This can
be justiﬁed using analytic continuation. But there are also direct ways of deriving (19.29); see, for
example, (Williams, 1991, Chapter E, Exercise E16.4) or (Shiryaev, 1996, Chapter II, Section 12,
Paragraph 2, Example 2). Another approach is to express dΦX(ϖ)/ dϖ as E

iX eiϖX
and to
use integration by parts to verify that the latter’s expectation is equal to −ϖΦX(ϖ) and to then
solve the diﬀerential equation dΦX(ϖ)/ dϖ = −ϖΦX(ϖ) with the condition ΦX(0) = 1 to obtain
that ln ΦX(ϖ) = −1
2 ϖ2.
4The distribution of |W| is sometimes called half-normal. It is the positive square root of
the central chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom.
5More generally, as we shall see in Chapter 23, X + Y is Gaussian whenever X and Y are
jointly Gaussian. And independent Gaussians are jointly Gaussian.

their sum is Gaussian. Applying this to α1X1, . . . , αnXn, which are independent
Gaussians whenever X1, . . . , Xn are independent Gaussians, we obtain:

Central and Noncentral Chi-Square Random Variables
We summarize here some of the deﬁnitions and main properties of the central and
noncentral χ2 distributions and of some related distributions. We shall only use
three results from this section: that the sum of the squares of two independent
N(0, 1) random variables has a mean-2 exponential distribution; that the distri-
bution of the sum of the squares of n independent Gaussian random variables of
unit-variance and possibly diﬀerent means depends only on n and on the sum of
the squared means; and that the MGF of this latter sum has a simple explicit form.
These results can be derived quite easily from the MGF of a squared Gaussian RV,
an MGF which, using (19.22), can be shown to be given by

(19.34)
Using the fact that the MGF of the sum of independent random variables is the
product of their MGFs and using (19.32) with μ = 0 and σ2 = 1, we obtain that
the MGF of the central χ2 distribution with n degrees of freedom is given by

(19.35)
Similarly, by (19.33) and the fact that the characteristic function of the sum of
independent random variables is the product of their characteristic functions, (or
by substituting iϖ for θ in (19.35)), we obtain that the characteristic function of
the central χ2 distribution with n degrees of freedom is given by
E

(19.36)
Notice that for n = 2 this characteristic function is given by ϖ 	→1/(1 −i2ϖ),
which is the characteristic function of the mean-2 exponential density
1
2 e−x/2 I{x > 0},
x ∈R.
Since two random variables of identical characteristic functions must be of equal
law (Proposition 19.7.1 (ii)), we conclude:
Note 19.8.1. The central χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom χ2
2 is the
mean-2 exponential distribution.
From (19.36) and the relationship between the moments of a distribution and the
derivatives at zero of its characteristic function (19.27), one can verify that the
ν-th moment of a χ2
n RV is given by

ν ∈N,
(19.37)
so the mean is n; the second moment is n(n + 2); and the variance is 2n.
Since the sum of the squares of random variables must be nonnegative, the density
of the χ2
n distribution is zero on the negative numbers. It is given by
fχ2
n(x) =
1
2n/2 Γ(n/2) e−x/2 x(n/2)−1 I{x > 0},
(19.38)
where Γ(·) is the Gamma function, which is deﬁned by
Γ(ξ) ≜

ξ > 0.
(19.39)
If the number of degrees of freedom is even, then the density has a particularly
simple form:

thus demonstrating again that when the number of degrees of freedom is two, the
central χ2 distribution is the mean-2 exponential distribution (Note 19.8.1).

A special case of this distribution is the central χ2 distribution, which corresponds
to the case where the noncentrality parameter λ is zero.
Explicit expressions for the density of the noncentral χ2 distribution can be found
in (Johnson, Kotz, and Balakrishnan, 1995, Chapter 29, Equation (29.4)) and in
(Simon, 2002, Chapter 2). An interesting representation of this density in terms
of the density fχ2

It demonstrates that a χ2
n,λ random variable X can be generated by picking a
random integer j according to the Poisson distribution of parameter λ/2 and by
then generating a central χ2 random variable of n + 2j degrees of freedom. That
is, to generate a χ2
n,λ random variable X, generate some random variable J taking
values in the nonnegative integers according to the law
Pr[J = j] = e−λ/2 (λ/2)j

,
j = 0, 1, . . .
(19.48)
and then generate X according the central χ2 distribution with n + 2j degrees of
freedom, where j is the outcome of J.

The generalized Rice distribution corresponds to the distribution of the square
root of a noncentral χ2 distribution with n degrees of freedom and noncentrality pa-
rameter λ. The case n = 2 is called the Rice distribution. The Rice distribution
is thus the distribution of the square root of a random variable having the noncen-

The Univariate Gaussian Distribution
The following property of the noncentral χ2 is useful in detection theory. In the sta-
tistics literature this property is called the Monotone Likelihood Ratio property
(Lehmann and Romano, 2005, Section 3.4). Alternatively, it is called the Total
Positivity of Order 2 of the function (x, λ) 	→fχ2
n,λ(x).
Proposition 19.8.3 (The Noncentral χ2 Family Has Monotone Likelihood Ratio).
Let fχ2
n,λ(ξ) denote the density at ξ of the noncentral χ2 distribution with n degrees
of freedom and noncentrality parameter λ ≥0; see (19.47). Then for ξ0, ξ1 > 0

The Limit of Gaussians Is Gaussian
There are a number of useful deﬁnitions of convergence for sequences of random
variables. Here we brieﬂy mention a few and show that, under each of these deﬁ-
nitions, the convergence of a sequence of Gaussian random variables to a random
variable X implies that X is Gaussian.
Let the random variables X, X1, X2, . . . be deﬁned over a common probability space
(Ω, F, P). We say that the sequence X1, X2, . . . converges to X with probability
one or almost surely if
Pr
'
ω ∈Ω : lim
n→∞Xn(ω) = X(ω)
(
= 1.
(19.54)
Thus, the sequence X1, X2, . . . converges to X almost surely if there exists an event
N ∈F of probability zero such that for every ω /∈N the sequence of real numbers
X1(ω), X2(ω), . . . converges to the real number X(ω).
The sequence X1, X2, . . . converges to X in probability if

We refer the reader to (Shiryaev, 1996, Ch. II, Section 10, Theorem 2) for a proof
that convergence in mean-square implies convergence in probability and for a proof
that almost-sure convergence implies convergence in probability. Also, if a sequence
converges in probability to X, then it has a subsequence that converges to X with
probability one (Shiryaev, 1996, Ch. II, Section 10, Theorem 5).

19.9 The Limit of Gaussians Is Gaussian
391
Theorem 19.9.1. Let the random variables X, X1, X2, . . . be deﬁned over a common
probability space (Ω, F, P). Assume that each of the random variables X1, X2, . . .
is Gaussian. If the sequence X1, X2, . . . converges to X in the sense of (19.54) or
(19.55) or (19.56), then X must also be Gaussian.
Proof. Since both mean-square convergence and almost-sure convergence imply
convergence in probability, it suﬃces to prove the theorem in the case where the
sequence X1, X2, . . . converges to X in probability. And since every sequence con-
verging to X in probability has a subsequence converging to X almost surely, it
suﬃces to prove the theorem for almost sure convergence. Our proof for this case
follows (Shiryaev, 1996, Ch. II, Section 13, Paragraph 5).
Since the random variables X1, X2, . . . are all Gaussian, it follows from (19.29) that

2 ϖ2σ2

ϖ ∈R,
(19.57)
where μn and σ2
n are the mean and variance of Xn. By the Dominated Convergence
Theorem it follows that the almost sure convergence of X1, X2, . . . to X implies
that
lim
n→∞E

eiϖXn

lim
n→∞eiϖμn−1
2 ϖ2σ2
n = E

eiϖX

ϖ ∈R.
(19.59)
The limit in (19.59) can exist for every ϖ ∈R only if there exist μ, σ2 such that
μn →μ and σ2
n →σ2. And in this case, by (19.59),
E

eiϖX

ϖ ∈R,
so, by Proposition 19.7.1 (ii) and by (19.29), X is N

μ, σ2
.
As we have noted, convergence in mean-square implies convergence in probability
(Shiryaev, 1996, Ch. II, Section 10, Theorem 2). The reverse is not true. But it is
true for Gaussian sequences:
Theorem 19.9.2. Let X1, X2, . . . be a sequence of Gaussian random variables that
converges in probability to the random variable X. Then X is Gaussian, and
lim
n→∞E

(Xn −X)p
= 0,
1 ≤p ≤∞,
where for p = ∞the above should be interpreted as indicating that for every ϵ > 0
the absolute diﬀerence |Xn −X| is upper-bounded by ϵ with probability one when-
ever n is suﬃciently large.
Proof. See (Neveu, 1968, Ch. I, Lemma 1.5).
Another type of convergence is convergence in distribution or weak conver-
gence, which is deﬁned as follows. Let F1, F2, . . . denote the cumulative distri-
bution functions of the sequence of random variables X1, X2, . . . We say that the

Chapter 20
Binary Hypothesis Testing
20.1
Introduction
In Digital Communications the task of the receiver is to observe the channel out-
puts and to use these observations to accurately guess the data bits that were sent
by the transmitter, i.e., the data bits that were fed to the modulator. Ideally, the
guessing would be perfect, i.e., the receiver would make no errors. This, alas, is
typically impossible because of the distortions and noise that the channel intro-
duces. Indeed, while one can usually recover the data bits from the transmitted
waveform (provided that the modulator is a one-to-one mapping), the receiver has
no access to the transmitted waveform but only to the received waveform. And
since the latter is typically a noisy version of the former, some errors are usually
unavoidable.
In this chapter we shall begin our study of how to guess intelligently, i.e., how,
given the channel output, one should guess the data bits with as low a probability
of error as possible. This study will help us not only in the design of receivers but
also in the design of modulators that allow for reliable decoding from the channel’s
output.
In the engineering literature the process of guessing the data bits based on the
channel output is called “decoding.”
In the statistics literature this process is
called “hypothesis testing.” We like “guessing” because it demystiﬁes the process.
In most applications the channel output is a continuous-time waveform and we seek
to decode a large number of bits. Nevertheless, for pedagogical reasons, we shall
begin our study with the simpler case where we wish to decode only a single data
bit. This corresponds in the statistics literature to “binary hypothesis testing,”
where the term “binary” reminds us that in this guessing problem there are only
two alternatives.
Moreover, we shall assume that the observation, rather than
being a continuous-time waveform, is a vector or a scalar. In fact, we shall begin
our study with the simplest case where there are no observations at all.
20.2
Problem Formulation
In choosing a guessing strategy to minimize the probability of error, the labels
of the two alternatives are immaterial. The principles that guide us in guessing

Binary Hypothesis Testing
the outcome of a fair coin toss (where the labels are “heads” or “tails”) are the
same as for guessing the value of a random variable that takes on the values +1
and −1 equiprobably. (These are, of course, extremely simple cases that can be
handled with common sense.) Statisticians typically denote the two alternatives
by H0 and H1 and call them “hypotheses.” We shall denote the two alternatives
by 0 and 1. We thus envision guessing the value of a random variable H taking
values in the set {0, 1} with probabilities
π0 = Pr[H = 0],
π1 = Pr[H = 1].
(20.1)
The prior is the distribution of H or the pair (π0, π1). It reﬂects the state of our
knowledge about H before having made any observations. We say that the prior
is nondegenerate if
π0, π1 > 0.
(20.2)
(If the prior is degenerate, then H is deterministic and we can determine its value
without any observation. For example if π0 = 0 we always guess 1 and never err.)
The prior is uniform if π0 = π1 = 1/2.
Aiding us in the guess work is the observation Y, which is a random vector
taking values in the observation space Rd.
(When d = 1 the observation is a
random variable and we denote it by Y .) We assume that Y is a column vector,
so, using the notation of Section 17.2,
Y =

Y (1), . . . , Y (d)T.
Typically there is some statistical dependence between Y and H; otherwise, Y
would be useless. If the dependence is so strong that from Y one can deduce H,
then our guess work is very easy: we simply compute from Y the value of H and
declare the result as our guess; we never err. The cases of most interest to us
are therefore those where Y neither determines H nor is statistically independent
of H. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we shall assume that, conditional on H = 0,
the observation Y is of density fY|H=0(·) and that, conditional on H = 1, it is of
density fY|H=1(·). Here fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·) are nonnegative Borel measurable
functions from Rd to R that integrate to one.1
Our problem is how to use the observation Y to intelligently guess the value of H.
At ﬁrst we shall limit ourselves to deterministic guessing rules. Later we shall show
that no randomized guessing rule can outperform an optimal deterministic rule. A
deterministic guessing rule (or decision rule, or decoding rule) for guessing H
based on Y is a (Borel measurable) mapping from the set of possible observations
Rd to the set {0, 1}. We denote such a mapping by
φGuess : Rd →{0, 1}
(20.3)
and say that φGuess(yobs) is the guess we make after having observed that Y = yobs.
1Readers who are familiar with Measure Theory should note that these are densities with
respect to the Lebesgue measure on Rd, but that the reference measure is inessential to our
analysis. We could have also chosen as our reference measure the sum of the probability measures
on Rd corresponding to H = 0 and to H = 1. This would have guaranteed the existence of the
densities.

20.3 Guessing in the Absence of Observables
397
The probability of error associated with the guessing rule φGuess(·) is
Pr(error) ≜Pr[φGuess(Y) ̸= H].
(20.4)
Note that two sources of randomness determine whether the guessing rule φGuess(·)
errs or not: the realization of H and the generation of Y conditional on that
realization.
We say that a guessing rule is optimal if no other guessing rule
attains a smaller probability of error. (We shall later see that there always exists
an optimal guessing rule.2) In general, there may be a number of diﬀerent optimal
guessing rules.
We shall therefore try to refrain from speaking of the optimal
guessing rule. We apologize if this results in cumbersome writing. The probability
of error associated with optimal guessing rules is the optimal probability of
error and is denoted throughout by
p∗(error).
20.3
Guessing in the Absence of Observables
We begin with the simplest case where there are no observables. Common sense
dictates that in this case we should base our guess on the prior (π0, π1) as follows.
If π0 > π1, then we should guess that the value of H is 0; if π0 < π1, then we
should guess the value 1; and if π0 = π1 = 1/2, then it does not really matter what
we guess: the probability of error will be either way 1/2.
To verify that this intuition is correct note that, since there are no observables,
there are only two guessing rules: the rule “guess 0” and the rule “guess 1.” The
former results in the probability of error π1 (it is in error whenever H = 1, which
happens with probability π1), and the latter results in the probability of error π0.
Hence the former rule is optimal if π0 ≥π1 and the latter is optimal when π1 ≥π0.
When π0 = π1 both rules are optimal and we can use either one.
We summarize that, in the absence of observations, an optimal guessing rule is:
φ∗
Guess =

0
if Pr[H = 0] ≥Pr[H = 1],
1
otherwise.
(20.5)
(Here we guess 0 also when Pr[H = 0] = Pr[H = 1]. An equally good rule would
guess 1 in this case.)
As we next show, the error probability p∗(error) of this rule is
p∗(error) = min

Pr[H = 0], Pr[H = 1]

.
(20.6)
This can be veriﬁed by considering the case where Pr[H = 0] ≥Pr[H = 1] and the
case where Pr[H = 0] < Pr[H = 1] separately. By (20.5), in the former case our
guess is 0 with the associated probability of error Pr[H = 1], whereas in the latter
case our guess is 1 with the associated probability of error Pr[H = 0]. In either
case the probability of error is given by the RHS of (20.6).
2Thus, while there is no such thing as “smallest strictly positive number,” i.e., a positive
number that is smaller-or-equal to any other positive number, we shall see that there always
exists a guessing rule that no other guessing rule can outperform. Mathematicians paraphrase
this by saying that “the inﬁmum of the probability of error over all the guessing rules is achievable,
i.e., is a minimum.”

20.4
The Joint Law of H and Y
Before we can extend the results of Section 20.3 to the more interesting case where
we guess H after observing Y, we pause to discuss the joint distribution of H
and Y. This joint distribution is needed in order to derive an optimal decision rule
and in order to analyze its performance. Some care must be exercised in describing
this law because H is discrete (binary) and Y has a density. It is usually simplest
to describe the joint law by describing the prior (the distribution of H), and by
then describing the conditional law of Y given H = 0 and the conditional law of Y
given H = 1.
If, conditional on H = 0, the distribution of Y has the density fY|H=0(·) and if,
conditional on H = 1, the distribution of Y has the density fY|H=1(·), then the
joint distribution of H and Y can be described using the prior (π0, π1) (20.1) and
the conditional densities
fY|H=0(·)
and
fY|H=1(·).
(20.7)
From the prior (π0, π1) and the conditional densities fY|H=0(·), fY|H=1(·) we can
compute the (unconditional) density of Y:
fY(y) = π0fY|H=0(y) + π1fY|H=1(y),
y ∈Rd.
(20.8)
The conditional distribution of H given Y = yobs is a bit more tricky because
the probability of Y taking on the value yobs (exactly) is zero. There are two
approaches to deﬁning Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] in this case: the heuristic one that is
usually used in a ﬁrst course on probability theory and the measure-theoretic one
that was pioneered by Kolmogorov. Our approach is to deﬁne this quantity in a
way that will be palatable to both mathematicians and engineers and to then give
a heuristic justiﬁcation for our deﬁnition.
We deﬁne the conditional probability that H = 0 given Y = yobs as
Pr

H = 0
 Y = yobs

≜
 π0fY|H=0(yobs)
fY(yobs)
if fY(yobs) > 0,
1
2
otherwise,
(20.9a)
where fY(·) is given in (20.8), and analogously
Pr

H = 1
 Y = yobs

≜
 π1fY|H=1(yobs)
fY(yobs)
if fY(yobs) > 0,
1
2
otherwise.
(20.9b)
Notice that our deﬁnition is meaningful in the sense that the values we assign to
Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] and Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs] are nonnegative and sum to one:
Pr

H = 0
 Y = yobs

+ Pr

H = 1
 Y = yobs

= 1,
yobs ∈Rd.
(20.10)
Also note that our deﬁnition of Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] and Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs]
for those yobs ∈Rd for which fY(yobs) = 0 is quite arbitrary; we chose 1/2 just

20.4 The Joint Law of H and Y
399
for concreteness.3 Indeed, it is not diﬃcult to verify that the probability that yobs
satisﬁes π0fY|H=0(yobs)+π1fY|H=1(yobs) = 0 is zero, and hence our deﬁnitions in
this eventuality are not important; see (20.12) ahead.
If d = 1, then the observation is a random variable Y and a heuristic way to
motivate (20.9a) is to consider the limit
lim

Pr

the approximations

Y ∈(yobs −δ, yobs + δ)

=
 yobs+δ
yobs−δ
fY (y) dy
≈2δfY (yobs),
δ ≪1,
to argue that, under suitable regularity conditions, (20.11) agrees with the RHS of
(20.9a) when fY (yobs) > 0. A similar calculation can be carried out in the vector
case where d > 1.
We next remark on observations yobs at which the density of Y is zero. Accounting
for such observations makes the writing a bit cumbersome as in (20.9). Fortunately,
the probability of such observations is zero:
Note 20.4.1. Let H be drawn according to the prior (π0, π1), and let the con-
ditional densities of Y given H be fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·) with fY(·) given in
(20.8). Then
Pr

Y ∈
˜y ∈Rd : fY(˜y) = 0

= 0.
(20.12)
Proof.
Pr

Y ∈
˜y ∈Rd : fY(˜y) = 0

=

{˜y∈Rd:fY(˜y)=0}
fY(y) dy
=

{˜y∈Rd:fY(˜y)=0}
0 dy
= 0,
where the second equality follows because the integrand is zero over the range of
integration.
3In the measure-theoretic probability literature our deﬁnition is just a “version” (among many
others) of the conditional probabilities of the event H = 0 (respectively H = 1), conditional on
the σ-algebra generated by the random vector Y (Billingsley, 1995, Section 33), (Williams, 1991,
Chapter 9).

Binary Hypothesis Testing
We conclude this section with two technical remarks which are trivial if you ignore
observations where fY(·) is zero:
Note 20.4.2. Consider the setup of Note 20.4.1.

min


⇐⇒

Pr[H = 0|Y = y] ≥Pr[H = 1|Y = y]

.
(20.14)
Proof. Identity (20.13) can be proved using (20.9) and (20.8) by separately con-
sidering the case fY(y) > 0 and the case fY(y) = 0 (where the latter is equivalent,
by (20.8), to π0fY|H=0(y) and π1fY|H=1(y) both being zero).
To prove (20.14) we also separately consider the case fY(y) > 0 and the case
fY(y) = 0. In the former case we note that for c > 0 the condition a ≥b is
equivalent to the condition a/c ≥b/c so for fY(yobs) > 0

π0fY|H=0(y) ≥π1fY|H=1(y)


Pr[H=0|Y=y]
≥π1fY|H=1(y)
fY(y)



Pr[H=1|Y=y]

.
In the latter case where fY(y) = 0 we note that, by (20.8), both π0fY|H=0(y)
and π1fY|H=1(y) are zero, so the condition on the LHS of (20.14) is true (0 ≥0).
Fortunately, when fY(y) = 0 the condition on the RHS of (20.14) is also true,
because in this case (20.9) implies that Pr[H = 0|Y = y] and Pr[H = 1|Y = y]
are both equal to 1/2 (and 1/2 ≥1/2).
20.5
Guessing after Observing Y
We next derive an optimal rule for guessing H after observing that Y = yobs.
We begin with a heuristic argument. Having observed that Y = yobs, there are
only two possible decision rules: to guess 0 or guess 1. Which should we choose?
The answer now depends on the a posteriori distribution of H. Once it has been
revealed to us that Y = yobs, our outlook changes and we now assign the event
H = 0 the a posteriori probability Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] and the event H = 1 the
complementary probability Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs]. If the former is greater than the
latter, then we should guess 0, and otherwise we should guess 1. Thus, after it has
been revealed to us that Y = yobs the situation is equivalent to one in which we
need to guess H without any observables and where our distribution on H is not

20.5 Guessing after Observing Y

its a priori distribution (prior) but its a posteriori distribution. Using our analysis
from Section 20.3 we conclude that the guessing rule
φ∗
Guess(yobs) =

0
if Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] ≥Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs],
1
otherwise,
(20.15)
is optimal. Once again, the way we resolve ties is arbitrary: if the observation
Y = yobs results in the a posteriori distribution of H being uniform, that is, if
Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] = Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs] = 1/2, then either guess is optimal.
Using Note 20.4.2 (ii) we can also express the decision rule (20.15) as
φ∗
Guess(yobs) =

0
if π0fY|H=0(yobs) ≥π1fY|H=1(yobs),
1
otherwise.
(20.16)
Conditional on Y = yobs, the probability of error of the optimal decision rule is,
in analogy to (20.6), given by
p∗(error|Y = yobs) = min

Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs], Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs]

,
(20.17)
as can be seen by treating the case Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] ≥Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs] and
the complementary case Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] < Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs] separately.
The unconditional probability of error associated with the rule (20.15) is thus

Let φGuess(·) be an arbi-

Binary Hypothesis Testing
Proof. Conditional on H = 0 the guessing rule makes an error only if Y does not
fall in the set of observations for which φGuess(·) produces the guess “H = 0.” This
establishes (20.21). A similar argument proves (20.22). Finally, (20.23) follows
from (20.21) & (20.22) using the identity
p(error) = π0 p(error|H = 0) + π1 p(error|H = 1).
We next state the key result about binary hypothesis testing. The statement is a
bit cumbersome because, in general, there may be many observations that result
in H being a posteriori uniformly distributed, and an optimal decision rule can
map each such observation to a diﬀerent guess and still be optimal.
Theorem 20.5.2 (Optimal Binary Hypothesis Testing). Suppose that a guessing
rule φ∗
Guess : Rd →{0, 1} produces the guess “H = 0” only when yobs is such that
π0fY|H=0(yobs) ≥π1fY|H=1(yobs), i.e.,

where the second equality follows from (20.31). The theorem now follows from
(20.28) and (20.32).
Referring to a situation where the observation results in the a posteriori distribu-
tion of H being uniform as a tie we have:
Note 20.5.3. The fact that both conditional on H = 0 and conditional on H = 1
the observation Y has a density does not imply that the probability of a tie is zero.
For example, if H takes values in {0, 1} equiprobably, and if the observation Y is
given by Y = H + U, where U is uniformly distributed over the interval [−2, 2]
independently of H, then the a posteriori distribution of H is uniform whenever
Y ∈[−1, 2], and this occurs with probability 3/4.
20.6
Randomized Decision Rules
So far we have restricted ourselves to deterministic decision rules, where the guess
is a deterministic function of the observation. We next remove this restriction and
allow for some randomization in the decision rule. As we shall see in this section
and in greater generality in Section 20.11, when properly deﬁned, randomization
does not help: the lowest probability of error that is achievable with randomized
decision rules can also be achieved with deterministic decision rules.
By a randomized decision rule we mean that, after observing that Y = yobs, the
guesser chooses some bias b(yobs) ∈[0, 1] and then tosses a coin of that bias.
If the result is “heads” it guesses 0 and otherwise it guesses 1.
Note that the
deterministic rules we have considered before are special cases of the randomized
ones: any deterministic decision rule can be viewed as a randomized decision rule
where, depending on yobs, the bias b(yobs) is either zero or one.
Some care must be exercised in deﬁning the joint distribution of the coin toss with
the other variables (H, Y). We do not want to allow for “telepathic coins.” That is,

we want to make sure that once Y = yobs has been observed and the bias b(yobs)
has been accordingly computed, the outcome of the coin toss is random, i.e., has
nothing to do with H. Probabilists would say that we require that, conditional on
Y = yobs, the outcome of the coin toss be independent of H. (We shall discuss
conditional independence in Section 20.11.) We can clarify the setting as follows.
Upon observing the outcome Y = yobs, the guesser computes the bias b(yobs).
Using a local random number generator the guesser then draws a random variable Θ
uniformly over the interval [0, 1], independently of the pair (H, Y). If the outcome θ
is smaller than b(yobs), then it guesses “H = 0,” and otherwise it guesses “H = 1.”
A randomized decision rule is depicted in Figure 20.1.
We oﬀer two proofs that randomized decision rules cannot outperform the best
deterministic ones.
The ﬁrst is by straightforward calculation.
Conditional on
Y = yobs, the randomized guesser makes an error either if Θ ≤b(yobs) (resulting
in the guess “H = 0”) while H = 1, or if Θ > b(yobs) (resulting in the guess
“H = 1”) while H = 0. Consequently,

.
(20.33)
Thus, Pr(error|Y = yobs) is a weighted average of Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] and
Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs]. As such, irrespective of the weights, it cannot be smaller
than the minimum of the two. But, by (20.17), the optimal deterministic decision
rule (20.15) achieves just this minimum. We conclude that, irrespective of the bias,
for each outcome Y = yobs the conditional probability of error of the randomized
decoder is lower-bounded by that of the optimal deterministic decoder (20.15).
Since this is the case for every outcome, it must also be the case when we average
over the outcomes. This concludes the ﬁrst proof.

20.7 The MAP Decision Rule
405
In the second proof we view the outcome of the local random number generator Θ
as an additional observation.
Since it is independent of (H, Y) and since it is
uniform over [0, 1],
fY,Θ|H=0(y, θ) = fY|H=0(y) fΘ|Y=y,H=0(θ)
= fY|H=0(y) fΘ(θ)
= fY|H=0(y) I{0 ≤θ ≤1},
(20.34a)
and similarly
fY,Θ|H=1(y, θ) = fY|H=1(y) I{0 ≤θ ≤1}.
(20.34b)
Since the randomized decision rule can be viewed as a deterministic decision
rule that is based on the pair (Y, Θ), it cannot outperform any optimal de-
terministic guessing rule based on (Y, Θ).
But by Theorem 20.5.2 and (20.34)
it follows that the deterministic decision rule that guesses “H = 0” whenever
π0fY|H=0(y) ≥π1fY|H=1(y) is optimal not only for guessing H based on Y but
also for guessing H based on (Y, Θ), because it produces the guess “H = 0” only
when π0fY,Θ|H=0(y, θ) ≥π1fY,Θ|H=1(y, θ) and it produces the guess “H = 1”
only when π1fY,Θ|H=1(y, θ) ≥π0fY,Θ|H=0(y, θ). This concludes the second proof.
Even though randomized decision rules cannot outperform the best deterministic
rules, they may have other advantages. For example, they allow for more symmetric
ways of resolving ties. Suppose, for example, that we have no observations and that
the prior is uniform. In this case guessing “H = 0” will give rise to a probability of
error of 1/2, with an error occurring whenever H = 1. Similarly guessing “H = 1”
will also result in a probability of error of 1/2, this time with an error occurring
whenever H = 0. If we think about H as being an information bit, then the former
rule makes sending 0 less error prone than sending 1. A randomized test that ﬂips
a fair coin and guesses 0 if “heads” and 1 if “tails” gives rise to the same average
probability of error (i.e., 1/2) and makes sending 0 and sending 1 equally (highly)
error prone.
If Y = yobs results in a tie, i.e., if it yields a uniform a posteriori distribution
on H,
Pr

H = 0
 Y = yobs

= Pr

H = 1
 Y = yobs

= 1
2,
then the probability of error of the randomized decoder (20.33) does not depend on
the bias. In this case there is thus no loss of optimality in choosing b(yobs) = 1/2,
i.e., by employing a fair coin. This makes for a symmetric way of resolving the tie
in the a posteriori distribution of H.
20.7
The MAP Decision Rule
In Section 20.5 we presented an optimal decision rule (20.15). A slight variation
on that decoder is the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decision rule. The MAP
rule is identical to (20.15) except in how it resolves ties. Unlike (20.15), which
resolves ties by guessing “H = 0,” the MAP rule resolves ties by ﬂipping a fair

(20.35)
where we use “U


” to indicate that we guess the outcome uniformly at
random.
Note that, like the rule in (20.15), the MAP rule is optimal. This follows because
the way ties are resolved does not inﬂuence the probability of error, and because
the MAP rule agrees with the rule (20.15) for all observations which do not result
in a tie.
Theorem 20.7.1 (The MAP Rule Is Optimal). The Maximum A Posteriori deci-
sion rule (20.35) is optimal.
Since the MAP decoder is optimal,
p∗(error) = π0 pMAP(error|H = 0) + π1 pMAP(error|H = 1),
(20.36)
where pMAP(error|H = 0) and pMAP(error|H = 1) denote the conditional prob-
abilities of error for the MAP decoder.
Note that one can easily ﬁnd guessing
rules (such as the rule “always guess 0”) that yield a conditional probability of
error smaller than pMAP(error|H = 0), but one cannot ﬁnd a rule whose average
probability of error outperforms the RHS of (20.36).
Using Note 20.4.2 (ii) we can express the MAP rule in terms of the densities and
the prior as
φMAP(yobs) =
⎧
⎪
⎨

function LR(·), which is deﬁned by

of the nonnegative reals and the special symbol ∞:

Using the likelihood-ratio function and (20.37), we can rewrite the MAP rule for

Since many of the densities that are of interest to us have an exponential form, it
is sometimes more convenient to describe the MAP rule using the log likelihood-
ratio function LLR: Rd →[−∞, ∞], which is deﬁned by
LLR(y) ≜ln fY|H=0(y)

The ML Decision Rule
A diﬀerent decision rule, which is typically suboptimal unless H is a priori uniform,
is the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) decision rule. Its structure is similar to that
of the MAP rule except that it ignores the prior. In fact, if π0 = π1, then the two
rules are identical. The ML rule is thus given by

Consider the problem of guessing H based on the observation Y , where H takes
on the values 0 and 1 equiprobably and where the conditional densities of Y given
H = 0 and H = 1 are

fY |H=1(y) =

√
2πσ2 e−(y+A)2/(2σ2),
y ∈R
(20.51b)
for some deterministic A, σ > 0. Here the observable is a RV, so d = 1.
For these conditional densities the likelihood-ratio function (20.38) is given by:
LR(y) = fY |H=0(y)
fY |H=1(y)

2πσ2 e−(y−A)2/(2σ2)

√
2πσ2 e−(y+A)2/(2σ2)

y ∈R.
Since the two hypotheses are a priori equally likely, the MAP rule is equivalent to
the ML rule and both rules guess “H = 0” or “H = 1” depending on whether the
likelihood-ratio LR(yobs) is greater or smaller than one. And since
LR(yobs) > 1 ⇐⇒e4yobsA/(2σ2) > 1
⇐⇒ln

e4yobsA/(2σ2)
> ln 1
⇐⇒4yobsA/(2σ2) > 0

⇐⇒ln

e4yobsA/(2σ2)
< ln 1
⇐⇒4yobsA/(2σ2) < 0
⇐⇒yobs < 0,
it follows that the MAP decision rule guesses “H = 0,” if yobs > 0; guesses “H = 1,”
if yobs < 0; and guesses “H = 0” or “H = 1” equiprobably, if yobs = 0 (i.e., in the
case of a tie).
Note that in this example the probability of a tie is zero.
Indeed, under both
hypotheses, the probability that the observed variable Y is exactly equal to zero is
zero:
Pr

Y = 0
 H = 0

= Pr

Y = 0
 H = 1

= Pr

Y = 0

= 0.
(20.52)
Consequently, the way ties are resolved is immaterial.
We next compute the probability of error of the MAP decoder. To this end, let
pMAP(error|H = 0) and pMAP(error|H = 1) denote its conditional probabilities of
error. Its (unconditional) probability of error, which is also the optimal probability
of error, can be expressed as
p∗(error) = π0 pMAP(error|H = 0) + π1 pMAP(error|H = 1).
(20.53)
We proceed to compute the required terms on the RHS. Starting with the term
pMAP(error|H = 0), we note that pMAP(error|H = 0) corresponds to the condi-
tional probability that Y is negative or that Y is equal to zero and the coin toss

that the MAP decoder uses to resolve the tie causes the guess to be “H = 1.” By
(20.52), the conditional probability of a tie is zero, so pMAP(error|H = 0) is, in
fact, just the conditional probability that Y is negative:

computed using the Q-function; see (19.12b) and (19.13). Similarly, using (19.12a),
pMAP(error|H = 1) = Pr[Y > 0|H = 1]

(20.55)
Note that in this example the MAP rule is “fair” in the sense that the conditional
probability of error given H = 0 is the same as given H = 1. This is a coincidence
(that results from the symmetry in the problem). In general, the MAP rule need
not be fair.

Note that the optimal decision rule for this example is not unique. Another optimal
decision rule is to guess “H = 0” if yobs is positive but not equal to 17, and to
guess “H = 1” otherwise.

(Nontelepathic) Processing
To further emphasize the optimality of the Maximum A Posteriori decision rule,
and for ulterior motives that have to do with the introduction of conditional inde-
pendence, we shall next show that no processing of the observables can reduce the
probability of a guessing error. To that end we shall have to properly deﬁne what
we mean by “processing.”
The ﬁrst thing that comes to mind is to consider processing as the application of
some deterministic mapping. I.e., we think of mapping the observation yobs using
some deterministic function g(·) to g(yobs) and then guessing H based on g(yobs).
That this cannot reduce the probability of error is clear from Figure 20.3, which
demonstrates that mapping yobs to g(yobs) and then guessing H based on g(yobs)
can be viewed as a special case of guessing H based on yobs and, as such, cannot
outperform the MAP decision rule, which is optimal among all decision rules based
on yobs.
A more general kind of processing involves randomization, or “dithering.” Here we
envision the processor as using a local random number generator to generate a ran-

dom variable Θ and then producing an output of the form g(yobs, θobs), where θobs
is the outcome of Θ, and where g(·) is some deterministic function. Here Θ is
assumed to be independent of the pair (H, Y), so the processor can generate it
using a local random number generator.
An argument very similar to the one we used in Section 20.6 (in the second proof of
the claim that randomized decision rules cannot outperform optimal deterministic
rules) can be used to show that this type of processing cannot improve our guessing.
The argument is as follows. We view the application of the function g(·) to the
pair (Y, Θ) as deterministic processing of the pair (Y, Θ), so no decision rule based
on g(Y, Θ) can outperform a decision rule that is optimal for guessing H based
on (Y, Θ).
It thus remains to show that the decision rule ‘Guess “H = 0” if
π0fY|H=0(yobs) ≥π1fY|H=1(yobs)’ is also optimal when observing (Y, Θ) and not
only Y. This follows from Theorem 20.5.2 by noting that the independence of Θ
and (H, Y), implies that
fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θobs) = fY|H=0(yobs) fΘ(θobs),
fY,Θ|H=1(yobs, θobs) = fY|H=1(yobs) fΘ(θobs),
and hence that this rule guesses “H = 0” only when yobs and θobs are such that
π0fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θobs) ≥π1fY,Θ|H=1(yobs, θobs) and guesses “H = 1” only when
π1fY,Θ|H=1(yobs, θobs) ≥π0fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θobs).
Fearless readers who are not afraid to divide by zero should note that
LR(yobs, θobs) = fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θobs)

so (ignoring some technical issues) the MAP detector based on (yobs, θobs) ig-
nores θobs and is identical to the MAP detector based on yobs only.4
Ostensibly more general is processing Y by mapping it to g(Y, Θ), where the
distribution of Θ is allowed to depend on yobs. This motivates us to further extend
the notion of processing. The cleanest way to deﬁne processing is to deﬁne its
outcome rather than the way it is generated.
Before deﬁning processing we remind the reader of the notion of conditional inde-
pendence. But ﬁrst we recall the deﬁnition of (unconditional) independence. We
do so for discrete random variables using their Probability Mass Function (PMF).
The extension to random variables with a joint density is straightforward. For the
deﬁnition of independence in more general scenarios see, for example, (Billingsley,
1995, Section 20) or (Lo`eve, 1963, Section 15) or (Williams, 1991, Chapter 4).
Deﬁnition 20.11.1 (Independent Discrete Random Variables). We say that the
discrete random variables X and Y of joint PMF PX,Y (·, ·) and marginal PMFs
PX(·) and PY (·) are independent if PX,Y (·, ·) factors as
PX,Y (x, y) = PX(x) PY (y).
(20.59)
Equivalently, X and Y are independent if, for every outcome y such that PY (y) > 0,
the conditional distribution of X given Y = y is the same as its unconditional
distribution:
PX|Y (x|y) = PX(x),
PY (y) > 0.
(20.60)
Equivalently, X and Y are independent if, for every outcome x such that PX(x) > 0,
the conditional distribution of Y given X = x is the same as its unconditional
distribution:
PY |X(y|x) = PY (y),
PX(x) > 0.
(20.61)
The equivalence of (20.59) and (20.60) follows because, by the deﬁnition of the
conditional probability mass function,
PX|Y (x|y) = PX,Y (x, y)
PY (y)
,
PY (y) > 0.
Similarly, the equivalence of (20.59) and (20.61) follows from
PY |X(y|x) = PX,Y (x, y)
PX(x)
,
PX(x) > 0.
The beauty of (20.59) is that it is symmetric in X, Y . It makes it clear that X
and Y are independent if, and only if, Y and X are independent. This is less
obvious from (20.60) or (20.61).
The deﬁnition of the conditional independence of X and Y given Z is similar, except
that we condition everywhere on Z. Again we only consider the discrete case and
refer the reader to (Lo`eve, 1963, Section 25.3) or (Chung, 2001, Section 9.2) or
(Kallenberg, 2002, Chapter 6) for the general case.
4Technical issues arise when the outcome of Θ, namely θobs, is such that fΘ(θobs) = 0.

Binary Hypothesis Testing
Deﬁnition 20.11.2 (Conditionally Independent Discrete Random Variables). Let
the discrete random variables X, Y, Z have a joint PMF PX,Y,Z(·, ·, ·). We say that
X and Y are conditionally independent given Z and write
X⊸−
−Z⊸−
−Y
if
PX,Y |Z(x, y|z) = PX|Z(x|z) PY |Z(y|z),
PZ(z) > 0.
(20.62)
Equivalently, X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if, for any outcome
y, z with PY,Z(y, z) > 0, the conditional distribution of X given that Y = y and
Z = z is the same as the distribution of X when conditioned on Z = z only:
PX|Y,Z(x|y, z) = PX|Z(x|z),
PY,Z(y, z) > 0.
(20.63)
Or, equivalently, X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if
PY |X,Z(y|x, z) = PY |Z(y|z),
PX,Z(x, z) > 0.
(20.64)
The equivalence of (20.62) and (20.63) follows because, by the deﬁnition of the
conditional probability mass function,
PX|Y,Z(x|y, z) = PX,Y,Z(x, y, z)
PY,Z(y, z)
= PX,Y |Z(x, y|z)PZ(z)
PY |Z(y|z)PZ(z)
= PX,Y |Z(x, y|z)
PY |Z(y|z)
,
PY,Z(y, z) > 0,
and similarly the equivalence of (20.62) and (20.64) follows from
PY |X,Z(y|x, z) = PX,Y |Z(x, y|z)
PX|Z(x|z)
,
PX,Z(x, z) > 0.
Again, the beauty of (20.62) is that it is symmetric in X, Y . Thus X⊸−
−Z⊸−
−Y if,
and only if, Y ⊸−
−Z⊸−
−X. When X and Y are conditionally independent given Z
we sometimes say that X⊸−
−Z⊸−
−Y forms a Markov chain.
The equivalence between the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of conditional independence con-
tinues to hold in the general case where the random variables are not necessarily
discrete. We only reluctantly state this as a theorem, because we never deﬁned
conditional independence in nondiscrete settings.
Theorem 20.11.3 (Equivalent Deﬁnition for Conditional Independence). Let X,
Y, and Z be random vectors. Then the following statements are equivalent:
(a) X and Y are conditionally independent given Z.
(b) The conditional distribution of Y given (X, Z) is equal to its conditional
distribution given Z.

(c) The conditional distribution of X given (Z, Y) is equal to its conditional
distribution given Z.
Proof. For a precise deﬁnition of concepts appearing in this theorem and for a
proof of the equivalence between the statements see (Kallenberg, 2002, Chapter 6)
or (Lo`eve, 1963, Section 25.3) and particularly Theorem 25.3A therein.
We are now ready to deﬁne the processing of the observation Y with respect to
the hypothesis H.
Deﬁnition 20.11.4 (Processing). We say that Z is the result of processing Y
with respect to H if H and Z are conditionally independent given Y.
As we next show, this deﬁnition of processing extends the previous ones. We ﬁrst
show that if Z = g(Y) for some deterministic Borel measurable function g(·) then
H⊸−
−Y⊸−
−g(Y).
This follows by noting that, conditional on Y, the random
variable g(Y) is deterministic and hence independent of everything and a fortiori
of H.
We next show that if Θ is independent of (H, Y), then H⊸−
−Y⊸−
−g(Y, Θ). In-
deed, if Z = g(Y, Θ) with Θ being independent of (Y, H), then, conditionally on
Y = y, the distribution of Z is simply the distribution of g(y, Θ) so (under this
conditioning) Z is independent of H.
We next show that processing the observables cannot help decrease the probability
of error. The proof is conceptually very simple; the neat part is in the deﬁnition.
Theorem 20.11.5 (Processing Is Futile). If Z is the result of processing Y with
respect to H, then no rule for guessing H based on Z can outperform an optimal
guessing rule based on Y.
Proof. Surely no decision rule that guesses H based on Z can outperform an
optimal decision rule based on Z, let alone outperform a decision rule that is
optimal for guessing H based on Z and Y. But an optimal decision rule based on
the pair (Z, Y) is the MAP rule, which compares
Pr[H = 0|Y = y, Z = z]
and
Pr[H = 1|Y = y, Z = z].
And, because H⊸−
−Y⊸−
−Z, it follows from Theorem 20.11.3 that this is equivalent
to comparing
Pr[H = 0|Y = y]
and
Pr[H = 1|Y = y]
i.e., to an optimal (MAP) decision rule based on Y only.
The above theorem is more powerful than it seems. To demonstrate its strength,
we next use it to show that in testing for a signal in Gaussian noise—irrespective of
the prior—the optimal probability of error is monotonically nondecreasing in the
noise variance. The setup we consider is one where H is of prior (π0, π1) and aiding
us in guessing H is the observable Y , which, conditional on H = m, is N

αm, σ2
for m ∈{0, 1}. We shall argue that, irrespective of the prior (π0, π1), the optimal
probability of error is monotonically nondecreasing in σ2.

Binary Hypothesis Testing
The beauty of the argument is that it allows us to prove the monotonicity result
without having to calculate the optimal probability of error explicitly (as we did
in Section 20.10 for the case of a uniform prior with α0 = A and α1 = −A). While
we could also compute the optimal probability of error for this more general setup
and then use calculus to derive the monotonicity result, the argument we present
instead has the advantage of also being applicable to multi-dimensional multi-
hypothesis testing scenarios, where there is typically no closed-form expression for
the optimal probability of error.
To prove this result, let p∗
e(σ2) denote the optimal probability of error as a function
of σ2. We need to show that p∗
e(σ2) ≤p∗
e(σ2 + δ2), for all δ ∈R. Consider the
low-noise case where the conditional law of Y given H is N

αm, σ2
. Suppose that
the receiver generates W ∼N

0, δ2
independently of (H, Y ) and adds W to Y
to form Z = Y + W. Since Z is the result of processing Y with respect to H, it
follows that the optimal probability of error based on Y , namely p∗
e(σ2), is at least
as good as the optimal probability of error based on Z (Theorem 20.11.5). We
now complete the argument by showing that the optimal probability of error based
on Z is p∗
e(σ2 + δ2). This follows because, by Proposition 19.7.2, the conditional
law of Z given H is N

αm, σ2 + δ2
.
Stated diﬀerently, since using a local random number generator the receiver can
produce from an observation Y of conditional law N

αm, σ2
a random variable Z
whose conditional law is N

αm, σ2 + δ2
, the minimal probability of error based
on an observation having conditional law N

αm, σ2
cannot be larger than the
optimal probability of error achievable based on an observation having conditional
law N

αm, σ2 + δ2
. See Figure 20.4 for an illustration of this argument.

Suﬃcient Statistics
This section aﬀords a ﬁrst glance at the notion of suﬃcient statistics, which will be
studied in greater depth and generality in Chapter 22. We begin with the following
example. Consider the hypothesis testing problem with a uniform prior, where the
observation is a tuple of real numbers (Y1, Y2). Conditional on H = 0, the random
variables Y1, Y2 are IID N

0, σ2

, whereas conditional on H = 1 they are IID
N

0, σ2

, where
σ0 > σ1 > 0.
(20.65)
(If σ2
0 = σ2
1, then the problem is boring in that the conditional law of the observable
given H = 0 is the same as given H = 1, so the two hypotheses cannot be diﬀer-
entiated. For σ2
0 ̸= σ2
1 there is no loss in generality in assuming σ0 > σ1 because
we can always relabel the hypotheses. And if σ0 > σ1 = 0, then the problem is
trivial: we guess “H = 1” only if Y1 = Y2 = 0.) Thus, the observation space is the
two-dimensional Euclidean space R2 and, using the explicit form of the Gaussian

1) (without the need to change the
inequality direction because this constant is by (20.65) positive).
It follows from (20.68) that the ML decision rule for guessing H based on (Y1, Y2)
computes Y 2
1 + Y 2
2 and then compares the result to a threshold. It is interesting to
note that to implement this decision rule one need not observe Y1 and Y2 directly;
it suﬃces to observe the sum of their squares
T ≜Y 2
1 + Y 2
2 .
(20.69)
Of course, being the result of processing (Y1, Y2) with respect to H, no guess of H
based on T can outperform an optimal guess based on (Y1, Y2) (Section 20.11).
But what is interesting about this example is that, even though one cannot recover
(Y1, Y2) from T (so there are some decision rules based on (Y1, Y2) that cannot
be implemented if one only knows T), the ML rule based on (Y1, Y2) only requires
knowledge of T. Thus, in this example, even though pre-processing the observations
to produce T = Y 2
1 +Y 2
2 is not reversible, basing one’s decision on T incurs no loss
of optimality. An optimal decision rule based on T is just as good as an optimal
rule based on (Y1, Y2).
The reason for this can be traced to the fact that, in this example, to compute the
likelihood-ratio LR(y1, y2) one need not know the pair (y1, y2); it suﬃces that one
know the sum of their squares y2
1 + y2
2; see (20.67). In this sense T = Y 2
1 + Y 2
2
forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing H from (Y1, Y2), as we next deﬁne.
We would like to deﬁne a mapping T(·) from the observation space Rd to Rd′ as
being suﬃcient for the densities fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·) if the likelihood-ratio
LR(yobs) can be computed from T(yobs) for every yobs in Rd. However, for techni-
cal reasons, we require slightly less: we only require that LR(yobs) be computable
from T(yobs) for those observations yobs for which at least one of the densities is
positive (so the likelihood-ratio is not of the form 0/0) and that additionally lie
outside some prespeciﬁed set Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero.5 Thus, we shall
require that there exist a set Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero and a function
ζ : Rd′ →[0, ∞] such that ζ

T(yobs)

is equal to LR(yobs) whenever
yobs /∈Y0
and
fY|H=0(yobs) + fY|H=1(yobs) > 0.
(20.70)
Note that the fact that Y0 is of Lebesgue measure zero implies that
Pr[Y ∈Y0 |H = 0] = Pr[Y ∈Y0 |H = 1] = 0.
(20.71)
To convince the reader that this really is only “slightly” less, we note:
Note 20.12.1. Both conditional on H = 0 and conditional on H = 1, the proba-
bility that the observable violates (20.70) is zero.
5We allow this exception set so that the question of whether T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic
or not will not depend on our choice of the density function of the conditional distribution of the
observable. (Recall that if a RV has a probability density function, then it has inﬁnitely many
diﬀerent probability density functions, every two of which diﬀer on a set of Lebesgue measure
zero.)

Proof. We shall show that conditional on H = 0, the probability that the ob-
servable violates (20.70) is zero. The conditional probability given H = 1 can be
analogously shown to be zero. The condition that (20.70) is violated is equivalent
to the condition that either yobs ∈Y0 or fY|H=0(yobs) + fY|H=1(yobs) = 0. By
(20.71), Pr[Y ∈Y0 |H = 0] = 0. And, by the nonnegativity of the densities,
Pr

fY|H=0(Y) + fY|H=1(Y) = 0

≤Pr

fY|H=0(Y) = 0

fY|H=0(y) dy
=

{˜y∈Rd:fY|H=0(˜y)=0}
0 dy
= 0.
Conditionally on H = 0, the probability of the observable violating (20.70) is thus
the probability of the union of two events, each of which is of zero probability, and
is thus of zero probability; see Corollary 21.5.2 ahead.
Deﬁnition 20.12.2 (Suﬃcient Statistic for Two Densities). We say that a map-

Here we can take Y0 to be the empty set.7
We next show that if T(·) is a suﬃcient statistic, then there is no loss of opti-
mality in considering decision rules that base their decision on T(Y). This result
6The technical condition that T(·) is Borel measurable guarantees that T(Y) is a random
vector. See for example (Billingsley, 1995, Theorem 13.1(ii)) for a discussion of this technical
issue.
The issue is best seen in the scalar case.
Suppose that Y is a RV deﬁned over the
probability space (Ω, F, P). If T(·) is any function, then T(Y ) is a mapping from Ω to the R, but
we are not guaranteed that it be a RV, because for T(Y ) to be a RV we must have that, for every
ξ ∈R, the set {ω ∈Ω : T(Y (ω)) ≤ξ} be in F, and this is, in general, not true. However, if T(·) is
Borel measurable, then the above cited theorem guarantees that T(X) is, indeed, a RV. Note that
any continuous function is Borel measurable (Billingsley, 1995, Theorem 13.2). In practice, one
never encounters functions that are not Borel measurable. In fact, it is hard work to construct
one.
7We would have needed to choose a nontrivial set Y0 if we had changed the densities (20.66)
at a ﬁnite (or countable) number of points.

is almost obvious, because the MAP decision rule is optimal (Theorem 20.7.1);
because it can be expressed in terms of the likelihood-ratio function (20.40); and
because the suﬃciency of T(·) implies that the likelihood-ratio function LR(yobs)
is computable from T(yobs). Nevertheless, we provide a formal proof because the
result is important.
Proposition 20.12.3. If T : Rd →Rd′ is a suﬃcient statistic for the densities
fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·), then, irrespective of the prior of H, there exists a decision
rule that guesses H based on T(Y) and which is as good as any optimal guessing
rule based on Y.
Proof. We need to show that if φ∗
Guess(·) is an optimal decision rule for guessing H
based on Y, then there exists a guessing rule based on T(Y) that has the same
probability of error. We note that it is enough to prove this result for a nondegen-
erate prior (20.2), because for degenerate priors one can achieve zero probability
of error even without looking at T(Y): if Pr[H = 0] = 1 guess “H = 0,” and if
Pr[H = 1] = 1 guess “H = 1.” We thus proceed to assume a nondegenerate prior
(20.2).
Let φMAP(·) be the MAP rule for guessing H based on Y. Since this rule is optimal,
it suﬃces to exhibit a decoding rule φT (·) based on T(Y) of equal performance.
Since T(·) is suﬃcient, it follows that there exists a set of Lebesgue measure zero Y0
and a Borel measurable function ζ(·) such that ζ

(20.70) holds. Based upon the observation T(Y) = T(yobs), the desired rule is to

(20.73)
That φT (·) has the same performance as φMAP(·) now follows by noting that,
by (20.72), the two decoding rules are in agreement except perhaps for observa-
tions yobs violating (20.70), but those, by Note 20.12.1, occur with probability zero.
The performance of φMAP(·) (which is optimal based on Y) and of φT (·) (which is
based on T(Y)) are thus identical.
Deﬁnition 20.12.2 is intuitive in that it demonstrates how one typically goes about
identifying a suﬃcient statistic: one computes the likelihood-ratio and checks what
it depends on.
This deﬁnition, however, becomes a bit cumbersome in multi-
hypothesis testing, which we shall discuss in Chapter 21. A deﬁnition that is more
appropriate for that setting is given in Chapter 22 in terms of the computability
of the a posteriori probabilities from T(yobs) (Deﬁnition 22.2.1). The purpose of
the next proposition is to show that the two deﬁnitions coincide in the binary case:
ignoring sets of Lebesgue measure zero, the likelihood-ratio can be computed from
T(yobs) (whenever the ratio is not 0/0), if, and only if, for any prior (π0, π1) one can
compute the a posteriori distribution of H from T(yobs) (whenever fY(yobs) > 0).
We draw the reader’s attention to the following subtle issue. Deﬁnition 20.12.2
makes it clear that the suﬃciency of T(·) has nothing to do with the prior; it only
depends on the densities fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·). The equivalent deﬁnition of

suﬃcient statistics in terms of the computability of the a posteriori distribution
ostensibly depends also on the prior, because it is only meaningful to discuss the a
posteriori distribution if H has a prior. Nevertheless, the deﬁnitions are equivalent
because in the latter deﬁnition we require that the a posteriori distribution be
computable from T(Y) for every prior, and not just for the prior given in the
problem’s formulation.
Proposition 20.12.4 (Computability of the a Posteriori Distribution). Let the
mapping T : Rd →Rd′ be Borel measurable, and let fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·) be
densities on Rd. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
(a) T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic for the densities fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·).
(b) For some set Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero we have that for every prior
(π0, π1) there exist Borel measurable functions from Rd′ to [0, 1]

whenever both the condition yobs /∈Y0, and the condition
π0fY|H=0(yobs) + π1fY|H=1(yobs) > 0
(20.75)
are satisﬁed. Here (20.74) is computed for H having the prior (π0, π1) and
for the conditional densities fY|H=0(·) and fY|H=1(·).
Proof. We begin by proving that (a) implies (b). That is, we assume that T(·)
forms a suﬃcient statistic and proceed to prove the existence of the set Y0 and
of the functions ψ0(·), ψ1(·). Let Y0 and ζ : Rd′ →[0, ∞] be as guaranteed by the
deﬁnition of suﬃcient statistics (Deﬁnition 20.12.2) so

We next show how to construct for every pair
(π0, π1) the functions ψ0(·), ψ1(·). We consider three cases separately: the case
π0 = 1 −π1 = 1, the case π0 = 1 −π1 = 0, and the case where both π0 and π1 are
strictly positive.
In the ﬁrst case H is deterministically zero, and the functions ψ0(1, 0, t) = 1 and
ψ1(1, 0, t) = 0 meet our requirements. In the second case H is deterministically
one, and the functions ψ0(0, 1, t) = 1 −ψ1(0, 1, t) = 0 meet our requirements.

that end we ﬁrst note that ψ0(π0, π1, t) and ψ1(π0, π1, t) are nonnegative and sum
to one.
We next note that, for π0, π1 > 0, the condition (20.75) implies that
fY|H=0(yobs) and fY|H=1(yobs) are not both zero. Consequently, if yobs satisﬁes
(20.75) and also yobs /∈Y0, then it satisﬁes (20.70) and LR(yobs) = ζ

.
Thus, in the case π0, π1 > 0, we have that, whenever (20.75) and yobs /∈Y0 hold,

and since Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs] = 1 −Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs]; see (20.77) and (20.10).
We now prove that (b) implies (a), i.e., that the existence of the set Y0 and of the
functions ψ0(·), ψ1(·) imply the existence of the function ζ(·) of Deﬁnition 20.12.2.
In fact, we shall prove a stronger statement that if for some nondegenerate prior
the a posteriori distribution of H given Y = yobs is computable from T(yobs)
(whenever (20.75) and yobs /∈Y0 hold), then there exists a function ζ : Rd′ →[0, ∞]
such that LR(yobs) = ζ(T(yobs)), whenever yobs satisﬁes (20.70).
To construct ζ(·) from ψ0(·) and ψ1(·), pick some arbitrary strictly positive ˜π0, ˜π1
summing to one (e.g., ˜π0, ˜π1 = 1/2), and deﬁne ζ(·) by

(20.78)
using the convention that a/0 = ∞for all a > 0; see (20.39).
We next verify that if yobs satisﬁes (20.70) then ζ(T(yobs)) = LR(yobs).
To
this end, deﬁne H to have the law Pr[H = 0] = ˜π0 and Pr[H = 1] = ˜π1,
and let the conditional law of Y given H be as speciﬁed by the given densities.
Since ˜π0 and ˜π1 are strictly positive, it follows that whenever fY|H=0(yobs) and
fY|H=1(yobs) are not both zero, we also have ˜π0fY|H=0(yobs)+˜π1fY|H=1(yobs) > 0.
Consequently, for strictly positive ˜π0, ˜π1 we have that (20.70) implies that yobs /∈Y0

Pr[H = 0] Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs]
= LR(yobs),
where the last equality follows by dividing the equation
Pr[H = 0|Y = yobs] =
Pr[H = 0] fY|H=0(yobs)
Pr[H = 0] fY|H=0(yobs) + Pr[H = 1] fY|H=1(yobs)
(which is a restatement of (20.9a) for our case) by
Pr[H = 1|Y = yobs] =
Pr[H = 1] fY|H=1(yobs)
Pr[H = 0] fY|H=0(yobs) + Pr[H = 1] fY|H=1(yobs)
(which is a restatement of (20.9b) for our case).
Once we have identiﬁed a suﬃcient statistic T(Y), we can proceed to derive an
optimal guessing rule using two methods that we describe next. Again, we focus
on nondegenerate priors.
Method 1:
We ignore the fact that T(Y) forms a suﬃcient statistic and simply
use the MAP rule (20.40):
φMAP(yobs) =

(20.79)
(Because T(Y) is a suﬃcient statistic, the likelihood-ratio function LR(yobs) will
be computable from T(yobs) whenever LR(yobs) does not have the pathological
form 0/0 and does not lie in the exception set Y0. Such pathological observations
occur with probability zero (20.12), so we need not worry about them.)
Method 2:
By Proposition 20.12.3, there is no loss of optimality in forming our
guess based on T(Y). So we can use any optimal rule, e.g., the MAP rule, for
guessing H based on the new d′-dimensional observations tobs = T(yobs). This
method requires computing the conditional distribution of the random d′-vector
T = T(Y) conditional on H = 0 and conditional on H = 1 and deciding according
to the rule:

Binary Hypothesis Testing
Why would we want to use Method 2 when we have already computed the likelihood-
ratio function to establish the suﬃciency of the statistic? The answer is that some-
times one can demonstrate that T(Y) forms a suﬃcient statistic by methods that
are not based on the computation of the likelihood-ratio. In such cases, Method 2
may be advantageous. Also, sometimes the analysis of the probability of error in
Method 2 is easier. The choice is ours.
Returning to the example of (20.66), we demonstrate Method 2 by calculating
the law of the suﬃcient statistic T = Y 2
1 + Y 2
2 under each of the hypotheses.
Recalling that the sum of the squares of two IID zero-mean Gaussians is exponential
(Note 19.8.1) we obtain:

20.14 Multi-Dimensional Binary Gaussian Hypothesis Testing
425
Because there is a one-to-one relationship between Y and T, there is no loss of
optimality in subtracting 1/2 from Y to obtain T and in then applying an optimal
decision rule to T. Indeed, since Y = T + 1/2, it follows that Y is the result of
processing T with respect to H, so no decision rule based on Y can outperform an
optimal decision rule based on T (Theorem 20.11.5). (Of course, no decision rule
based on T can outperform an optimal one based on Y , because T is the result of
processing Y with respect to H.) In fact, using the terminology of Section 20.12,
T : y 	→y −1/2 forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing H based on Y , because the
likelihood-ratio function LR(yobs) = fY |H=0(yobs)/fY |H=1(yobs) can be expressed
as ζ

T(yobs)

for the mapping ζ : t 	→LR(t + 1/2). Consequently, our assertion
that there is no loss of optimality in forming our guess based on T(Y ) is just a
consequence of Proposition 20.12.3.
Conditional on H = 0, the random variable T(Y ) is N

−0.5, σ2
, and, conditional
on H = 1, it is N

+0.5, σ2
. Consequently, using the results of Section 20.10 (with
the substitution of 1/2 for A), we obtain that an optimal rule based on T is to guess
“H = 0” if T is negative, and to guess “H = 1” if T is positive. To summarize, the
decision rule we derived is to guess “H = 0” if Y −1/2 < 0 and to guess “H = 1”
if Y −1/2 > 0.
In the terminology of Section 20.12, we used the fact that the transformation in
(20.82) is one-to-one to conclude that T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic, and we then
used Method 2 from that section to derive an optimal decision rule.
20.14
Multi-Dimensional Binary Gaussian Hypothesis Testing
We now come closer to the receiver front end.
The kind of problem we would
eventually like to address is the hypothesis testing problem in which, conditional
on H = 0, the observable is a continuous-time waveform of the form s0(t) + N(t)
whereas, conditional on H = 1, it is of the form s1(t) + N(t), where

N(t), t ∈R

is some continuous-time stochastic process modeling the noise. This problem will
be addressed in Chapter 26. For now we only address the discrete-time version of
this problem.
20.14.1
The Setup
We consider the problem of guessing the random variable H that takes on the
values 0 and 1 with positive probabilities π0 and π1. The observable Y ∈RJ is
a random vector with J components Y (1), . . . , Y (J).8 Conditional on H = 0, the
components of Y are independent Gaussians with Y (j) ∼N

s(j)
0 , σ2
, where s0 is
some deterministic vector of J components s(1)
0 , . . . , s(J)
0 , and where σ2 > 0. Con-
ditional on H = 1, the components of Y are independent with Y (j) ∼N

s(j)
1 , σ2
,
for some other deterministic vector s1 of J components s(1)
1 , . . . , s(J)
1 . We assume
that s0 and s1 diﬀer in at least one coordinate. The setup can be described as
H = 0: Y (j) = s(j)
0
+ Z(j),
j = 1, 2, . . . , J,
8We use J rather than d in order to comply with the notation of Section 21.6 ahead.

and to guess “H = 1” otherwise. This decision rule is illustrated in Figure 20.5.
Depicted are the cases where π1/π0 is smaller than one, equal to one, and larger
than one.
It is interesting to note that the projection ⟨y, φ⟩E φ of y onto the normalized
vector φ = (s0 −s1)/ ∥s0 −s1∥forms a suﬃcient statistic for this problem. Indeed,
by (20.83), the log likelihood-ratio (and hence the likelihood-ratio) function is
computable from ⟨y, φ⟩E. The projection is depicted in Figure 20.6.
The rule (20.87) simpliﬁes if H has a uniform prior. In this case the rule is
Guess “H = 0” if
⟨y, φ⟩E ≥⟨s0, φ⟩E + ⟨s1, φ⟩E

.
(20.88)
Note that in this case the guessing rule can be implemented even if σ2 is unknown.
20.14.3
Error Probability Analysis
We next ﬁnd the error probability associated with our guessing rule. Denote the
conditional error probabilities associated with our guessing rule by p(error|H = 0)
and p(error|H = 1). Since our rule is optimal, its unconditional probability of error
is p∗(error), and thus
p∗(error) = π0 p(error|H = 0) + π1 p(error|H = 1).
(20.89)
Because in (20.87) we resolved ties by guessing “H = 0”, it follows that to evaluate
p(error|H = 0) we need to evaluate the probability that a random vector Y drawn

according to the density fY|H=0(·) is such that the a posteriori probability of H = 0
is strictly smaller than the a posteriori probability of H = 1. Thus, if ties in the a

This equality continues to hold if we replace the weak inequality (≥) in the deﬁnition
of B1,0 with a strict inequality (>).
Proof. Using a calculation identical to the one leading to (20.83) we obtain that

where the ﬁrst equality follows from (20.94) and from the observation that the
density f0(·) is the density of s0 + Z; the second because ⟨·, ·⟩E is linear in the ﬁrst
argument, so ⟨s0 + Z, φ⟩E = ⟨s0, φ⟩E+⟨Z, φ⟩E; the third by noting that multiplying
both sides of an inequality by (−1) requires changing the direction of the inequality;
the fourth by the linear relationship ⟨s1, φ⟩E−⟨s0, φ⟩E = ⟨s1 −s0, φ⟩E; the ﬁfth by
(20.86); and the ﬁnal equality because, as we next argue, ⟨Z, −φ⟩E ∼N

we can employ (19.12a). To see that ⟨Z, −φ⟩E ∼N

, note that, by (20.86),
∥−φ∥= 1 and then employ Proposition 19.7.3.
This establishes the ﬁrst part of the lemma. The result where the weak inequality
is replaced with a strict inequality follows by replacing all the weak inequalities
in the proof with the corresponding strict inequalities and vice versa. (If X has a
density, then Pr[X < ξ] = Pr[X ≤ξ].)

This has a nice geometric interpretation. It is the probability that a N

∥s0 −s1∥/σ is the number of standard deviations that separate s0 and s1, we can
express the probability of error as the probability that a standard Gaussian exceeds
half the distance between the vectors as measured in standard deviations of the
noise.

20.15
Guessing in the Presence of a Random Parameter
We now consider the guessing problem when the distribution of the observable Y
depends not only on the hypothesis H but also on a random parameter Θ, which
is independent of H. Based on the conditional densities fY|Θ,H=0(·), fY|Θ,H=1(·),
the nondegenerate prior π0, π1 > 0, and on the law of Θ, we seek an optimal rule
for guessing H. We distinguish between two cases depending on whether we must
base our guess on the observed value yobs of Y alone—random parameter not
observed—or whether we also observe the value θobs of Θ—random parameter
observed. The analysis of both cases is conceptually straightforward.
20.15.1
Random Parameter Not Observed
The guessing problem when the random parameter is not observed is sometimes
called “testing in the presence of a nuisance parameter.” Conceptually, the situ-
ation is quite simple. We have only one observation, Y = yobs, and an optimal
decision rule is the MAP rule (Theorem 20.7.1). The MAP rule entails computing
the likelihood-ratio function
LR(yobs) = fY|H=0(yobs)
fY|H=1(yobs),
(20.100)
and comparing the result to the threshold π1/π0; see (20.40).
Often, however, the densities fY|H=0(yobs) and fY|H=1(yobs) appearing in (20.100)
are not given directly. Instead we are given the density of Θ and the conditional
density of Y given (H, Θ). (We shall encounter such a situation in Chapter 27
when we discuss noncoherent communications.) In such cases we can compute the
conditional density fY|H=0(yobs) as follows:
fY|H=0(yobs) =

θ
fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θ) dθ
=

θ
fY|Θ=θ,H=0(yobs) fΘ|H=0(θ) dθ
=

θ
fY|Θ=θ,H=0(yobs) fΘ(θ) dθ,

432
Binary Hypothesis Testing
where the ﬁrst equality follows because from the joint density one obtains the
marginal density by integrating out the variable in which we are not interested;
the second by the deﬁnition of the conditional density; and the ﬁnal equality from
our assumption that Θ and H are independent. (In computations such as these
it is best to think about the conditioning on H = 0 as deﬁning a new law on
(Y, Θ)—a new law to which all the regular probabilistic manipulations, such as
marginalization and computation of conditional densities, continue to apply. We
thus simply think of the conditioning on H = 0 as specifying the joint law of (Y, Θ)
that we have in mind.)
Repeating the calculation under H = 1 we obtain that the likelihood-ratio function
is given by
LR(yobs) =

θ fY|Θ=θ,H=0(yobs) fΘ(θ) dθ

θ fY|Θ=θ,H=1(yobs) fΘ(θ) dθ.
(20.102)
The case where Θ is discrete can be similarly addressed. An optimal decision rule
can now be derived based on this expression for the likelihood-ratio function and
on the MAP rule (20.40).
20.15.2
Random Parameter Observed
When the random parameter is observed to be Θ = θobs, we merely view the
problem as a standard hypothesis testing problem with the observation consisting
of Y and Θ. That is, we base our decision on the likelihood-ratio function
LR(yobs, θobs) = fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θobs)
fY,Θ|H=1(yobs, θobs).
(20.103)
The additional twist is that because Θ is independent of H we have
fY,Θ|H=0(yobs, θobs) = fΘ|H=0(θobs) fY|Θ=θobs,H=0(yobs)
= fΘ(θobs) fY|Θ=θobs,H=0(yobs),
(20.104)
where the second equality follows from the independence of Θ and H. Repeating
for the conditional law of the pair (Y, Θ) given H = 1 we have
fY,Θ|H=1(yobs, θobs) = fΘ(θobs) fY|Θ=θobs,H=1(yobs).
(20.105)
Consequently, by (20.103), (20.104), and (20.105), we obtain that for θobs satisfying
fΘ(θobs) ̸= 0
LR(yobs, θobs) = fY|H=0,Θ=θobs(yobs)
fY|H=1,Θ=θobs(yobs).
(20.106)
An optimal decision rule can be again derived based on this expression for the
likelihood-ratio and on the MAP rule (20.40).

Exercise 20.14 (The Probability of Y Being in a Set). Consider binary hypothesis testing
with a uniform prior.
(i) Suppose that the (Lebesgue measurable) subset A of Rd is such that
Pr[Y ∈A|H = 1] −Pr[Y ∈A|H = 0] = Δ,
where Δ is some positive number.

(iii) Find a set A for which this holds with equality.
Thus, if the optimal probability of error is very close to 1/2, then for every (Lebesgue
measurable) subset A ⊆Rd the probability that Y is in A hardly depends on H.
Hint: For Part (i) compare an optimal guessing rule to a (possibly suboptimal) rule that
guesses “H = 1” if Y ∈A and “H = 0” otherwise.

if Y > y⋆for some real number y⋆.
(ii) Show that if z →log fZ(z) is a concave function, then (20.109) is satisﬁed.
Mathematicians state this result by saying that if g: R →R is positive, then the mapping

concave (Marshall, Olkin, and Arnold, 2011, Chapter 18, Section A, Example A.10).
Statisticians state this result by saying that a location family generated by a positive
PDF f(·) has monotone likelihood ratios if, and only if, f(·) is log-concave. For more on

Chapter 21
Multi-Hypothesis Testing
21.1
Introduction
In Chapter 20 we discussed how to guess the outcome of a binary random variable.
We now extend the discussion to random variables that take on more than two—but
still a ﬁnite—number of values. Statisticians call this problem “multi-hypothesis
testing” to indicate that there may be more than two hypotheses. Rather than
using H, we now denote the random variable whose outcome we wish to guess
by M. (In Chapter 20 we used H for “hypothesis;” now we use M for “message.”)
We denote the number of possible values that M can take by M and assume that
M ≥2. (The case M = 2 corresponds to binary hypothesis testing.) As before the
“labels” are not important and there is no loss in generality in assuming that M
takes values in the set M = {1, . . . , M}. (In the binary case we used the traditional
labels 0 and 1 but now we prefer 1, 2, . . . , M.)
21.2
The Setup
A random variable M takes values in the set M = {1, . . . , M}, where M ≥2,
according to the prior
πm = Pr[M = m],
m ∈M,
(21.1)
where
πm ≥0,
m ∈M,
(21.2)
and where

m∈M
πm = 1.
(21.3)
We say that the prior is nondegenerate if
πm > 0,
m ∈M,
(21.4)
with the inequalities being strict, so M can take on any value in M with positive
probability. We say that the prior is uniform if
π1 = · · · = πM = 1
M.

442
Multi-Hypothesis Testing
The observation is a random vector Y taking values in Rd. We assume that for
each m ∈M the distribution of Y conditional on M = m has the density1
fY|M=m(·),
m ∈M,
(21.6)
where fY|M=m(·) is a nonnegative Borel measurable function that integrates to
one over Rd.
A guessing rule is a Borel measurable function φGuess : Rd →M from the space
of possible observations Rd to the set of possible messages M. We think about
φGuess(yobs) as the guess we form after observing that Y = yobs.
The error
probability associated with the guessing rule φGuess(·) is given by
Pr

φGuess(Y) ̸= M

.
(21.7)
Note that two sources of randomness determine whether we err or not: the real-
ization of M and the generation of Y conditional on that realization. A guessing
rule is said to be optimal if no other guessing rule achieves a lower probability
of error.2 The optimal error probability p∗(error) is the probability of error
associated with an optimal decision rule. In this chapter we shall derive optimal
decision rules and study the optimal probability of error.
21.3
Optimal Guessing
Having observed that Y = yobs, we would like to guess M. An optimal guessing
rule can be derived, as in the binary case, by ﬁrst considering the scenario where
there are no observables.
Its extension to the more interesting case where we
observe Y is straightforward.
21.3.1
Guessing in the Absence of Observables
In this scenario there are only M deterministic decision rules to choose from: the
decision rule “guess 1”, the decision rule “guess 2”, etc. If we employ the “guess 1”
rule, then we are correct if M is indeed equal to 1 and thus with probability of
success π1 and corresponding probability of error of 1−π1. In general, if we employ
the “guess m” rule for some m ∈M, then our probability of success is πm. Thus,
of the M diﬀerent rules at our disposal, the one that has the highest probability
of success is the “guess ˜m” rule, where ˜m is the outcome that is a priori the most
likely. If this ˜m is not unique, then guessing any one of the outcomes that have
the highest a priori probability is optimal.
1We feel no remorse for limiting ourselves to conditional distributions possessing a density.
The reason is that, while the reader is encouraged to assume that the densities are with respect to
the Lebesgue measure, this assumption is never used in the text. And using the Radon-Nikodym
Theorem (Billingsley, 1995, Section 32), one can show that even in the most general case there
exists a measure on Rd with respect to which the conditional laws of Y given each of the possible
values of M are absolutely continuous. That measure can be taken, for example, as the sum of
the conditional laws corresponding to each of the possible values that M can take.
2As in the case of binary hypothesis testing, an optimal guessing rule always exists; see
Footnote 2 on Page 397.

21.3 Optimal Guessing
443
We conclude that in the absence of observables, the guessing rule “guess ˜m” is
optimal if, and only if,
π ˜m = max
m′∈M πm′.
(21.8)
For an optimal guessing rule the probability of success is
p∗(correct) = max
m′∈M πm′
(21.9)
and the optimal error probability is thus
p∗(error) = 1 −max
m′∈M πm′.
(21.10)
21.3.2
The Joint Law of M and Y
Using the prior {πm} and the conditional densities {fY|M=m(·)}, we can express
the unconditional density of Y as
fY(y) =

m∈M
πm fY|M=m(y),
y ∈Rd.
(21.11)
As in Section 20.4, we deﬁne for every m ∈M and for every yobs ∈Rd the
conditional probability that M equals m given Y = yobs by
Pr[M = m|Y = yobs] ≜
⎧
⎪
⎨
⎪
⎩
πm fY|M=m(yobs)
fY(yobs)
if fY(yobs) > 0,
1
M
otherwise.
(21.12)
By an argument similar to the one proving (20.12) we have
Pr

Y ∈
˜y ∈Rd : fY(˜y) = 0

= 0,
(21.13)
which can also be written as
Pr

fY(Y) = 0

= 0.
21.3.3
Guessing in the Presence of Observables
The problem of guessing in the presence of an observable is very similar to the
one without observables. The intuition is that after observing that Y = yobs, we
associate with each m ∈M the a posteriori probability Pr[M = m|Y = yobs] and
then guess M as though there were no observables. Thus, rather than choosing
the message that has the highest a priori probability as we do in the absence of
observables, we should now choose the message that has the highest a posteriori
probability.
After having observed that Y = yobs we should thus guess “ ˜m” where ˜m is the out-
come in M that has the highest a posteriori probability. If more than one outcome
attains the highest a posteriori probability, then we say that a tie has occurred
and we need to resolve this tie by picking one (it does not matter which) of the

444
Multi-Hypothesis Testing
outcomes that attains the maximum a posteriori probability. We thus guess “ ˜m,”
in analogy to (21.8), only if
Pr[M = ˜m|Y = yobs] = max
m′∈M

Pr[M = m′ |Y = yobs]

.
(We shall later deﬁne the Maximum A Posteriori guessing rule as a randomized
decision rule that picks uniformly at random from the outcomes that have the
highest a posteriori probability; see Deﬁnition 21.3.2 ahead.)
In analogy with (21.9), for this optimal rule
p∗(correct|Y = yobs) = max
m′∈M

Pr[M = m′ |Y = yobs]

,
and, in analogy with (21.10),
p∗(error|Y = yobs) = 1 −max
m′∈M

Pr[M = m′ |Y = yobs]

.
Consequently, the unconditional optimal probability of error can be expressed as
p∗(error) =

Rd

1 −max
m′∈M

Pr[M = m′ |Y = y]

fY(y) dy,
(21.14)
where fY(·) is the unconditional density function of Y and is given in (21.11).
We next proceed to make the above intuitive discussion more rigorous. We begin
by deﬁning for every possible observation yobs ∈Rd the set of outcomes of maximal
a posteriori probability:
˜
M(yobs) ≜
'
˜m ∈M : Pr[M = ˜m|Y = yobs] = max
m′∈M Pr[M = m′ |Y = yobs]
(
.
(21.15)
As we next argue, this set can also be expressed as
˜
M(yobs) =
'
˜m ∈M : π ˜m fY|M= ˜m(yobs) = max
m′∈M πm′ fY|M=m′(yobs)
(
.
(21.16)
This can be shown by treating the case fY(yobs) > 0 and the case fY(yobs) = 0
separately. In the former case, (21.16) is veriﬁed by noting that in this case we
have, by (21.12), that Pr[M = m′ |Y = yobs] = πm′ fY|M=m′(yobs)/fY(yobs), so
the result follows because scaling the scores of all the elements of a set by a positive
number that is common to them all (1/fY(yobs)) does not change the subset of
the elements with the highest score. In the latter case we note that, by (21.12),
we have for all m′ ∈M that Pr[M = m′ |Y = yobs] = 1/M, so the RHS of (21.15)
is M and we also have by (21.11) for all m′ ∈M that πm′ fY|M=m′(yobs) = 0 so
the RHS of (21.16) is also M.
Using the above deﬁnition of ˜
M(yobs) we can now state the main theorem regarding
optimal guessing rules.
Theorem 21.3.1 (Optimal Multi-Hypothesis Testing). Let M take values in the
set M = {1, . . . , M} with the prior (21.1), and let the observation Y be a random

Any guessing rule φ∗
Guess : Rd →M that satisﬁes
φ∗
Guess(yobs) ∈˜
M(yobs),
yobs ∈Rd
(21.17)
is optimal. Here
˜
M(yobs) is the set deﬁned in (21.15) or (21.16).
Proof. Every (deterministic) guessing rule induces a partitioning of the space of
possible outcomes Rd into M disjoint sets D1, . . . , DM:
M

m=1
Dm = Rd,
(21.18a)
Dm ∩Dm′ = ∅,
m ̸= m′,
(21.18b)
where Dm is the set of observations that result in the guessing rule producing
the guess “M = m.” Conversely, every partition D1, . . . , DM of Rd corresponds
to some deterministic guessing rule that guesses “M = m” whenever yobs ∈Dm.
Searching for an optimal decision rule is thus equivalent to searching for an optimal
way to partition Rd. For every partition D1, . . . , DM the probability of success of
the guessing rule associated with it is given by
Pr(correct) =

m∈M
πm Pr(correct|M = m)
=

dy.
To minimize the probability of error we maximize the probability of correct deci-
sion. We thus need to ﬁnd a partition D1, . . . , DM that maximizes the last integral.
To maximize the integral we shall maximize the integrand

m∈M
πm fY|M=m(y) I{y ∈Dm}.
For a ﬁxed value of y, the value of the integrand depends on the set to which we
have assigned y. If y was assigned to D1 (i.e., if y ∈D1), then all the terms in the
sum except for the ﬁrst are zero, and the value of the integrand is π1 fY|M=1(y).
More generally, if y was assigned to Dm, then all the terms in the sum except for
the m-th term are zero, and the value of the integrand is πm fY|M=m(y). For a
ﬁxed value of y, the integrand will thus be maximized if we assign y to the set D ˜m
(and correspondingly guess ˜m), only if
π ˜m fY|M= ˜m(y) = max
m′∈M

πm′ fY|M=m′(y)

.
Thus, if φ∗
Guess(·) satisﬁes the theorem’s hypotheses, then it maximizes the in-
tegrand for every y ∈Rd and thus also maximizes the probability of guessing
correctly.

Multi-Hypothesis Testing
21.3.4
The MAP and ML Rules
As in the binary hypothesis testing case, we can also consider randomized decision
rules. Extending the deﬁnition of a randomized decision rule to our setting, one
can show using arguments very similar to those of Section 20.6 that randomization
does not help: no randomized decision rule can yield a smaller probability of error
than an optimal deterministic rule. But randomized decision rules can yield more
symmetric or more “fair” rules.
Indeed, we shall deﬁne the MAP rule as the
randomized rule that resolves ties by choosing one of the messages that achieves
the highest a posteriori probability uniformly at random:
Deﬁnition 21.3.2 (The M-ary MAP Decision Rule). The Maximum A Poste-
riori decision rule is the guessing rule that, after observing that Y = yobs, forms
a guess by picking uniformly at random an element of the set
˜
M(yobs), which is
deﬁned in (21.15) or (21.16).
Theorem 21.3.3 (The MAP Rule Is Optimal). For the setting of Theorem 21.3.1
the MAP decision rule is optimal in the sense that it achieves the smallest proba-
bility of error among all deterministic or randomized decision rules. Thus,
p∗(error) =

m∈M
πm pMAP(error|M = m),
(21.19)
where p∗(error) denotes the optimal probability of error and pMAP(error|M = m)
denotes the conditional probability of error of the MAP rule.
Proof. Irrespective of the realization of the randomization that is used to pick
an element of
˜
M(yobs), the resulting decision rule is optimal (Theorem 21.3.1).
Consequently, the average probability of error that results when we average over
this source of randomness must also be optimal.
The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) rule ignores the prior. It is identical to the
MAP rule when the prior is uniform. Having observed that Y = yobs, the ML
decoder produces as its guess a member of the set
'
˜m ∈M : fY|M= ˜m(yobs) = max
m′∈M fY|M=m′(yobs)
(
that is drawn uniformly at random.
The ML decoder thus guesses “M = ˜m” only if
fY|M= ˜m(yobs) = max
m′∈M fY|M=m′(yobs).
(21.20)
(If more than one outcome achieves this maximum, it chooses uniformly at random
one of the outcomes that achieves the maximum.)

the result of processing Y with respect to M, then no decision rule based on Z can
outperform an optimal decision rule based on Y.

The Setup
Consider the case where M is uniformly distributed over the set M = {1, . . . , M}
and where we would like to guess the outcome of M based on an observation
consisting of a two-dimensional random vector Y of components Y (1) and Y (2).
Conditional on M = m, the random variables Y (1) and Y (2) are independent
with Y (1) ∼N

am, σ2
and Y (2) ∼N

bm, σ2
. We assume that σ2 > 0, so the
conditional densities can be written for every m ∈M and every y(1), y(2) ∈R as

This hypothesis testing problem is related to QAM communication over an additive
white Gaussian noise channel with a pulse shape that is orthogonal to its time shifts
by integer multiples of the baud period. The setup is demonstrated in Figure 21.1

where y = (y(1), y(2))T, sm ≜(am, bm)T for m ∈M, and ∥·∥denotes the Euclidean
distance (20.85). It is thus seen that the ML rule (which is equivalent to the MAP
rule because the prior is uniform) is equivalent to a “nearest-neighbor” decoding
rule, which chooses the hypothesis under which the mean vector is closest to the
observed vector (with ties being resolved at random).

nearest-neighbor decoding rule for 8-PSK. The shaded region corresponds to the

Exact Error Analysis for 8-PSK
The analysis of the probability of error can be a bit tricky. Here we only present
the analysis for 8-PSK. If nothing else, it will motivate us to seek more easily
computable bounds.
We shall compute the probability of error conditional on M = 4. But there is
nothing special about this choice; the rotational symmetry of the problem implies
that the probability of error does not depend on the hypothesis.
Conditional on M = 4, the observables (Y (1), Y (2))T can be expressed as

centered on the mean (a4, b4) = (−A, 0). Note that fY (1),Y (2)|M=4(·) is symmetric

The shaded region in the ﬁgure is the set of pairs (y(1), y(2)) that cause the nearest-
neighbor decoder to guess “M = 4.”3 Conditional on M = 4 an error results if
(Y (1), Y (2)) is outside the shaded region.
Referring now to Figure 21.4 we need to compute the probability that the noise
(Z(1), Z(2)) causes the received signal to lie in the union of the shaded areas. The
symmetry of fY (1),Y (2)|M=4(·) about the horizontal axis (21.23) implies that the
probability that the received vector lies in the darkly-shaded region is the same as
3It can be shown that the probability that the observation lies exactly on the boundary of
the region is zero; see Proposition 21.6.2 ahead. We shall thus ignore this possibility.

Let ψ = π/8 denote half the angle between the constellation points. To carry out

The Union-of-Events Bound
Although simple, the Union-of-Events Bound, or Union Bound for short, is an
extremely powerful and useful bound.4 To derive it, recall that one of the axioms
of probability is that the probability of the union of two disjoint events is the sum
of their probabilities.5 Given two not necessarily disjoint events V and W, we can
express the set V as in Figure 21.5 as the union of those elements of V that are not
in W and those that are both in V and in W:
V = (V \ W) ∪(V ∩W).
(21.27)
Because the sets V \ W and V ∩W are disjoint, and because their union is V, it
follows that Pr(V) = Pr(V \ W) + Pr(V ∩W), which can also be written as
Pr(V \ W) = Pr(V) −Pr(V ∩W).
(21.28)
Writing the union V ∪W as the union of two disjoint sets
V ∪W = W ∪(V \ W)
(21.29)
as in Figure 21.6, we conclude that
Pr(V ∪W) = Pr(W) + Pr(V \ W),
(21.30)
which combines with (21.28) to prove that
Pr(V ∪W) = Pr(V) + Pr(W) −Pr(V ∩W).
(21.31)
Since probabilities are nonnegative, it follows from (21.31) that
Pr(V ∪W) ≤Pr(V) + Pr(W),
(21.32)
which is the Union Bound. This bound can also be extended to derive an upper
bound on the union of more sets. For example, we can show that for three events
U, V, W we have Pr(U ∪V ∪W) ≤Pr(U)+Pr(V)+Pr(W). Indeed, by ﬁrst applying
the Union Bound to the two sets U and (V ∪W) we obtain
Pr(U ∪V ∪W) = Pr

U ∪(V ∪W)

≤Pr(U) + Pr(V ∪W)
≤Pr(U) + Pr(V) + Pr(W),
4It is also sometimes called Boole’s Inequality.
5Actually the axiom is stronger; it states that this holds also for a countably inﬁnite number
of sets.

where the last inequality follows by applying the Union Bound (21.32) to the two
sets V and W. One can continue the argument by induction for a ﬁnite6 collection
of events to obtain:

inﬁnite collection of events then
Pr

(21.33)
We can think about the LHS of (21.33) as the probability that at least one of
the events V1, V2, . . . occurs and of its RHS as the expected number of events that
occur. Indeed, if for each j we deﬁne the random variables Xj(ω) = I{ω ∈Vj} for
all ω ∈Ω, then the LHS of (21.33) is equal to Pr
 
j Xj > 0

, and the RHS is

j E[Xj], which can also be expressed as E
 

.
After the trivial bound that the probability of any event cannot exceed one, the
Union Bound is probably the most important bound in Probability Theory. What
makes it so useful is the fact that the RHS of (21.33) can be computed without
regard to any dependencies between the events.
Corollary 21.5.2.
(i) If each of a ﬁnite (or countably inﬁnite) collection of events occurs with prob-

To prove Part (ii) we assume that each of the events W1, W2, . . . occurs with
probability one and apply Part (i) to the sets V1, V2, . . ., where Vj is the set-

where the ﬁrst equality follows because the probabilities of an event and its com-

union of the complements; and the ﬁnal equality follows from Part (i) because
the events Wj are, by assumption, of probability one so their complements are of
probability zero.
21.5.1
Applications to Hypothesis Testing
We shall now use the Union Bound to derive an upper bound on the conditional
probability of error pMAP(error|M = m) of the MAP decoding rule. The bound
we derive is applicable to any decision rule that satisﬁes the hypothesis of Theo-
rem 21.3.1 as expressed in (21.17).
Deﬁne for every m′ ̸= m the set Bm,m′ ⊂Rd by
Bm,m′ =

y ∈Rd : πm′ fY|M=m′(y) ≥πm fY|M=m(y)

.
(21.34)
Notice that y ∈Bm,m′ does not imply that the MAP rule will guess m′: there may
be a third hypothesis that is a posteriori even more likely than either m or m′.
Also, since the inequality in (21.34) is not strict, y ∈Bm,m′ does not imply that
the MAP rule will not guess m: there may be a tie, which may be resolved in favor
of m. As we next argue, what is true is that if m was not guessed by the MAP rule,
.023

then some m′ which is not equal to m must have had an a posteriori probability
that is at least as high as that of m:

(21.35)
Indeed, if m was not guessed by the MAP rule, then some other message was.
Denoting that other message by m′, we note that πm′ fY|M=m′(y) must be at least
as large as πm fY|M=m(y) (because otherwise m′ would not have been guessed),
so y ∈Bm,m′.
Continuing from (21.35), we note that if the occurrence of an event E1 implies the
occurrence of an event E2, then Pr(E1) ≤Pr(E2). Consequently, by (21.35),
pMAP(error|M = m) ≤Pr

for guessing M based on Y. Then,

(21.38)
This bound is applicable to any decision rule satisfying the hypothesis of Theo-
rem 21.3.1 as expressed in (21.17).
The term Pr[Y ∈Bm,m′ |M = m] has an interesting interpretation. If ties occur
with probability zero, then it corresponds to the conditional probability of error
(given that M = m) incurred by a MAP decoder designed for the binary hypothesis

Example: The Union Bound for 8-PSK
We next apply the Union Bound to upper-bound the probability of error associated
with maximum-likelihood decoding of 8-PSK. For concreteness we focus on the
conditional probability of error, conditional on M = 4. We shall see that in this
case the RHS of (21.36) is still an upper bound on the probability of error even if
we do not sum over all m′ that diﬀer from m. Indeed, as we next argue, in upper-
bounding the conditional probability of error of the ML decoder given M = 4, it
suﬃces to sum over m′ ∈{3, 5} only.
To show this we ﬁrst note that for this problem the set Bm,m′ of (21.34) corresponds
to the set of vectors that are at least as close to (am′, bm′) as to (am, bm):
Bm,m′ =
'
y ∈R2 :

y(1) −am′2 +

y(2) −bm′2 ≤

y(1) −am
2 +

y(2) −bm
2(
.
As seen in Figure 21.7, given M = 4, an error will occur only if the observed
vector Y is at least as close to (a3, b3) as to (a4, b4), or if it is at least as close
to (a5, b5) as to (a4, b4). Thus, conditional on M = 4, an error can occur only if
Y ∈B4,3 ∪B4,5. (If Y /∈B4,3 ∪B4,5, then an error will certainly not occur. If
Y ∈B4,3 ∪B4,5, then an error may or may not occur. It will not occur in the case
of a tie—corresponding to Y being on the boundary of B4,3 ∪B4,5—provided that
the tie is resolved in favor of M = 4.)

where the ﬁrst inequality follows because, conditional on M = 4, an error can
occur only if y ∈B4,3 ∪B4,5; and where the second inequality follows from the
Union-of-Events Bound. In fact, the ﬁrst inequality holds with equality because,
for this problem, the probability of a tie is zero; see Proposition 21.6.2 ahead.
From our analysis of multi-dimensional binary hypothesis testing (Lemma 20.14.1)

This is only an upper bound and not the exact error probability because the sets
B4,3 and B4,5 are not disjoint so the events Y ∈B4,3 and Y ∈B4,5 are not
mutually exclusive and the Union-Bound is not tight; see Figure 21.7. Nevertheless,
a moment’s reﬂection will convince the reader that the bound is oﬀby no more
than a factor of two; see also (21.66) ahead.

21.5.3
Union-Bhattacharyya Bound
We next derive a bound which is looser than the Union Bound but which is of-
ten easier to evaluate in non-Gaussian settings. It is the multi-hypothesis testing
version of the Bhattacharyya Bound (20.50).
Recall that, by Theorem 21.3.1, any guessing rule whose guess after observing that
Y = yobs is in the set
˜
M(yobs) =

˜m ∈M : π ˜m fY|M= ˜m(yobs) = max

is optimal. To analyze the optimal probability of error p∗(error), we shall analyze
one particular optimal decision rule. This rule is not the MAP rule, but it diﬀers
.023
14:36:37, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at

21.5 The Union-of-Events Bound
457
from the MAP rule only in the way it resolves ties. Rather than resolving ties at
random, this rule resolves ties according to the index of the hypothesis: it chooses
the message in
˜
M(yobs) of smallest index. For example, if the messages of highest
a posteriori probability are Messages 7, 9, and 17, i.e., if ˜
M(yobs) = {7, 9, 17}, then
it guesses “7.” This decision rule may not appeal to the reader’s sense of fairness
but, by Theorem 21.3.1, it is nonetheless optimal. Consequently, if we denote the
conditional probability of error of this decoder by p(error|M = m), then
p∗(error) =

m∈M
πm p(error|M = m).
(21.45)
We next analyze the performance of this decision rule. For every m′ ̸= m let
˜Bm,m′ =

y ∈Rd : πm′ fY|M=m′(y) ≥πm fY|M=m(y)

if m′ < m,

y ∈Rd : πm′ fY|M=m′(y) > πm fY|M=m(y)

if m′ > m.
(21.46)
Notice that
˜Bm,m′ = ˜Bc

m ̸= m′.
(21.47)
Conditional on M = m, our detector will err if, and only if, yobs ∈∪m′̸=m ˜Bm,m′.

Multi-Dimensional M-ary Gaussian Hypothesis Testing
We next use Theorem 21.3.3 to study the multi-hypothesis testing version of the
problem we addressed in Section 20.14. We begin with the problem setup and then
proceed to derive the MAP decision rule. We then assess the performance of this
rule by deriving an upper bound and a lower bound on its probability of error.
21.6.1
Problem Setup
A random variable M takes values in the set M = {1, . . . , M} with a nondegen-
erate prior (21.4).
We wish to guess M based on an observation consisting of
a random column-vector Y taking value in RJ whose components are given by
Y (1), . . . , Y (J).7 For typographical reasons we denote the observed realization of
7Our observation now takes values in RJ and not as before in Rd. My excuse for using J
instead of d is that later, when we refer to this section, d will have a diﬀerent meaning and
choosing J here reduces the chance of confusion later on.

Y by y, instead of yobs. For every m ∈M we have that, conditional on M = m,
the components of Y are independent Gaussians, with Y (j) ∼N(s(j)
m , σ2), where
sm is some deterministic vector of J components s(1)
m , . . . , s(J)
m , and where σ2 > 0.
Recalling the density of the univariate Gaussian distribution (19.6) and using the
conditional independence of the components of Y given M = m, we can express the
conditional density fY|M=m(y) of the vector Y at every point y = (y(1), . . . , y(J))T
in RJ as

Optimal Guessing Rule
Using Theorem 21.3.3 we obtain that, having observed y = (y(1), . . . , y(J))T ∈RJ,
an optimal decision rule is the MAP rule, which picks uniformly at random an
element from the set
˜
M(y) =

where the second equality follows from the strict monotonicity of the logarithm.
We next obtain a more explicit description of
˜
M(y) for our setup. By (21.51),

(21.53)
The term (J/2) ln(2πσ2) is a constant term that does not depend on the hypothesis.
Consequently, it does not inﬂuence the set of messages that attain the highest score.
(The tallest student in the class is the same irrespective of whether the height of all
the students is measured when they are barefoot or when they are all wearing the
one-inch heel school uniform shoes. The heel can only make a diﬀerence if diﬀerent

where the ﬁrst equality follows because when M is uniform the additive term ln πm
is given by ln(1/M) and hence does not depend on the hypothesis; and where the
second equality follows because changing the sign of all the elements of a set changes
the largest ones to the smallest ones, and by noting that scaling the score by 2σ2
does not change the highest scoring messages (because we assumed that σ2 > 0).
If we interpret the quantity

C
J

j=1

as the Euclidean distance between the vector y and the vector sm, then we see that,
for a uniform prior on M, it is optimal to guess the message m whose corresponding
mean vector sm is closest to the observed vector y. Notice that to implement this
“nearest-neighbor” decision rule we do not need to know the value of σ2.
We next show that if, in addition to assuming a uniform prior on M, we also
assume that the vectors s1, . . . , sM all have the same norm, i.e.,
∥s1∥= ∥s2∥= · · · = ∥sM∥,
(21.54)
then

so the MAP decision rules guesses the message m whose mean vector sm has
the “highest correlation” with the received vector y. To see this, we note that
because M has a uniform prior the “nearest-neighbor” decoding rule is optimal,
and we then expand

where the ﬁrst term does not depend on the hypothesis and where, by (21.54), the

We summarize our ﬁndings in the following proposition.
Proposition 21.6.1. Consider the problem described in Section 21.6.1 of guess-
ing M based on the observation y.

(ii) If M is uniformly distributed, then this rule is equivalent to the “nearest-
neighbor” decoding rule of picking uniformly at random an element of the
set

˜m ∈M : ∥y −s ˜m∥= min
m′∈M

∥y −sm′∥

.
(iii) If, in addition to M being uniform, we also assume that the mean vectors
satisfy (21.54), then this rule is equivalent to the “maximum-correlation” rule
of picking at random an element of the set

We next show that if the mean vectors s1, . . . , sM are distinct in the sense that for
every pair m′ ̸= m′′ in M there exists at least one component where the vectors
sm′ and sm′′ diﬀer, i.e.,
∥sm′ −sm′′∥> 0,
m′ ̸= m′′,
then the probability of ties is zero. That is, we will show that the probability of
observing a vector y for which the set
˜
M(y) (21.52) has more than one element
is zero. Stated in yet another way, the probability that the observable Y will be
such that the MAP will require randomization is zero. Stated one last time:
Proposition 21.6.2. If the mean vectors s1, . . . , sM in our setup are distinct, then
with probability one the observed vector y is such that there is a unique message of
highest a posteriori probability.
Proof. Conditional on Y = y, associate with each message m ∈M the score
ln

πm fY|M=m(y)

. We need to show that the probability of the observation y
being such that at least two messages attain the highest score is zero. Instead, we
shall prove the stronger statement that the probability of two messages attaining
the same score (be it maximal or not) is zero.
We ﬁrst show that it suﬃces to prove that for every m ∈M and for every pair of
messages m′ ̸= m′′, we have that, conditional on M = m, the probability that m′
and m′′ attain the same score is zero, i.e.,
Pr

score of Message m′ = score of Message m′′  M = m

= 0,
m′ ̸= m′′.
(21.55)
Indeed, once we show (21.55), it will follow that the unconditional probability that
Message m′ attains the same score as Message m′′ is zero, i.e.,
Pr

score of Message m′ = score of Message m′′
= 0,
m′ ̸= m′′,

But (21.56) implies that the probability that any two or more messages attain the

where the ﬁrst equality follows because more than one message attains the high-
est score if, and only if, there exist two distinct messages m′ and m′′ that attain
the highest score; the subsequent inequality follows from the Union Bound (Theo-
rem 21.5.1); and the ﬁnal inequality by noting that if m′ and m′′ both attain the
highest score, then they both achieve the same score.
Having established that in order to complete the proof it suﬃces to establish
(21.55), we proceed to do so. By (21.53) we obtain, upon opening the square,
that the observation Y results in Messages m′ and m′′ obtaining the same score if,

(21.57)
We next show that, conditional on M = m, the probability that Y satisﬁes (21.57)
is zero. To that end we note that, conditional on M = m, the random variables
Y (1), . . . , Y (J) are independent random variables with Y (j) being Gaussian with
mean s(j)
m and variance σ2; see (21.51). Consequently, by Proposition 19.7.3, we
have that, conditional on M = m, the LHS of (21.57) is a Gaussian random variable
of variance
1
σ2 ∥sm′ −sm′′∥2,
which is positive because m′ ̸= m′′ and because we assumed that the mean vectors
are distinct.
It follows that, conditional on M = m, the LHS of (21.57) is a
Gaussian random variable of positive variance, and hence has zero probability of
being equal to the deterministic number on the RHS of (21.57). This proves (21.55),
and hence concludes the proof.
21.6.3

A Lower Bound
We next derive a lower bound on the optimal error probability p∗(error). We do so
by lower-bounding the conditional probability of error pMAP(error|M = m) of the
MAP rule and by then using this lower bound to derive a lower bound on p∗(error)
via (21.19).
We note that if Message m′ attains a score that is strictly higher than the one
attained by Message m, then the MAP decoder will surely not guess “M = m.”
(The MAP may or may not guess “M = m′” depending on the score associated
with messages other than m and m′.) Thus, for each message m′ ̸= m we have
pMAP(error|M = m) ≥Pr

Chapter 22
Suﬃcient Statistics
22.1
Introduction
In layman’s terms, a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on the observable Y
is a random variable or a collection of random variables that contains all the infor-
mation in Y that is relevant for guessing M. This is a particularly useful concept
when the suﬃcient statistic is more concise than the observables. For example, if
we observe the results of a thousand coin tosses Y1, . . . , Y1000 and we wish to test
whether the coin is fair or has a bias of 1/4, then a suﬃcient statistic turns out
to be the number of “heads”among the outcomes Y1, . . . , Y1000.1 Another example
was encountered in Section 20.12. There the observable was a two-dimensional
random vector, and the suﬃcient statistic summarized the information that was
relevant for guessing H in a scalar random variable; see (20.69).
In this chapter we provide a formal deﬁnition of suﬃcient statistics in the multi-
hypothesis setting and explore the concept in some detail. We shall see that our
deﬁnition is compatible with Deﬁnition 20.12.2, which we gave for the binary case.
We only address the case where the observations take value in the d-dimensional
Euclidean space Rd. Also, we only treat the case of guessing among a ﬁnite number
of alternatives. We thus consider a ﬁnite set of messages
M = {1, . . . , M},
(22.1)
where M ≥2, and we assume that associated with each message m ∈M is a density
fY|M=m(·) on Rd, i.e., a nonnegative Borel measurable function that integrates to
one.
The concept of suﬃcient statistics is deﬁned for the family of densities
fY|M=m(·),
m ∈M;
(22.2)
it is unrelated to a prior. But when we wish to use it in the context of hypothesis
testing we need to introduce a probabilistic setting. If, in addition to the family
{fY|M=m(·)}m∈M, we introduce a prior {πm}m∈M, then we can discuss the pair
1Testing whether a coin is fair or not is a more complicated hypothesis testing problem of a
kind that we shall not address. It falls under the category of “composite hypothesis testing.”

22.2
Deﬁnition and Main Consequence
In this section we shall deﬁne suﬃcient statistics for a family of densities (22.2).
We shall then state the main result about this notion, namely, that there is no loss
of optimality in basing one’s guess on a suﬃcient statistic.
Very roughly, T(·) (or sometimes T(Y)) forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M
based on Y if there exists a black box that, when fed T(yobs) (but not yobs) and
any prior {πm} on M produces the a posteriori distribution of M given Y = yobs.
For technical reasons we make two exceptions. While the black box must always
produce a probability vector, we only require that this vector be the a posteriori
distribution of M given Y = yobs for observations yobs that satisfy

m∈M
πm fY|M=m(yobs) > 0
(22.5)
and that lie outside some prespeciﬁed set Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero. Thus,
if yobs is in Y0 or if (22.5) is violated, then the output of the black box can be any
probability vector. The exception set Y0 is not allowed to depend on {πm}. Since
it is of Lebesgue measure zero, the conditional probability that the observation Y
lies in Y0 is zero:
Pr

Y ∈Y0
 M = m

= 0,
m ∈M.
(22.6)
Note that the black box need not indicate whether yobs is in Y0 and/or whether
(22.5) holds. Figure 22.1 depicts such a black box.
Deﬁnition 22.2.1 (Suﬃcient Statistics for M Densities). We say that a mapping
T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient statistic for the densities fY|M=1(·), . . . , fY|M=M(·)
on Rd if it is Borel measurable and if for some Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero we
have that for every prior {πm} there exist M Borel measurable functions from Rd′

are satisﬁed. Here (22.7) is computed for M having the prior {πm} and for the
conditional law of Y given M corresponding to the given densities.
The main result regarding suﬃcient statistics is that if T(·) forms a suﬃcient
statistic, then—even if the transformation T(·) is not reversible—there is no loss
of optimality in basing one’s guess on T(Y).
Proposition 22.2.2 (Guessing Based on T(Y) Is Optimal). If T : Rd →Rd′
is a suﬃcient statistic for the M densities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M, then, given any
prior {πm}, there exists an optimal decision rule that bases its decision on T(Y).
Proof. To prove the proposition we shall exhibit a decision rule that is based
on T(Y) and that mimics the MAP rule based on Y. Since the latter is optimal
(Theorem 21.3.3), our proposed rule must also be optimal. Let {ψm(·)} be as in
Deﬁnition 22.2.1. Given Y = yobs, the proposed decoder considers the set of all
messages ˜m satisfying

(22.9)
and picks uniformly at random from this set.
We next argue that this decision rule is optimal. To that end we shall show that,
with probability one, this guessing rule is the same as the MAP rule for guessing M
based on Y. Indeed, the guess produced by this rule is identical to the one produced

by the MAP rule whenever yobs satisﬁes (22.8) and lies outside Y0.
Since the
probability that Y satisﬁes (22.8) is, by (21.13), one, and since the probability
that Y is outside Y0 is, by (22.6), also one, it follows from Corollary 21.5.2 that
the probability that Y satisﬁes both (22.8) and the condition Y /∈Y0 is also one.
Thus, the proposed guessing rule, which bases its decision only on T(yobs) and
on the prior has the same performance as the (optimal) MAP decision rule for
guessing M based on Y.
22.3
Equivalent Conditions
In this section we derive a number of important equivalent deﬁnitions for suﬃcient
statistics. These will further clarify the concept and will also be useful in identifying
suﬃcient statistics. We shall try to state the theorems rigorously, but our proofs
will be mostly heuristic. Rigorous proofs require some Measure Theory that we
do not wish to assume. For a rigorous measure-theoretic treatment of this topic
see (Halmos and Savage, 1949), (Lehmann and Romano, 2005, Section 2.6), or
(Billingsley, 1995, Section 34).2
22.3.1
The Factorization Theorem
The following characterization is useful because it is purely algebraic. It explores
the form that the densities {fY|M=m(·)} must have for T(Y) to form a suﬃcient
statistic. Roughly speaking, T(·) is suﬃcient if the densities in the family all have
the form of a product of two functions, where the ﬁrst function depends on the
message and on T(y), and where the second function does not depend on the
message but may depend on y. We allow, however, an exception set Y0 ⊂Rd of
Lebesgue measure zero, so we only require that for every m ∈M
fY|M=m(y) = gm

T(y)

h(y),
y /∈Y0.
(22.10)
Note that if such a factorization exists, then it also exists with the additional
requirement that the functions be nonnegative. Indeed, if (22.10) holds, then by
the nonnegativity of the densities

Suﬃcient Statistics
changing the direction of the inequality. For our setting the Factorization Theorem
can be stated as follows.3
Theorem 22.3.1 (The Factorization Theorem). A Borel measurable function
T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient statistic for the M densities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M
on Rd if, and only if, there exists a set Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero and non-
negative Borel measurable functions g1, . . . , gM : Rd′ →[0, ∞) and h: Rd →[0, ∞)
such that for every m ∈M
fY|M=m(y) = gm

T(y)

h(y),
y ∈Rd \ Y0.
(22.11)
Proof. We begin by showing that if T(·) is a suﬃcient statistic then there exists a
factorization of the form (22.11). Let the set Y0 and the functions {ψm(·)} be as in
Deﬁnition 22.2.1. Pick some ˜π1, . . . , ˜πM > 0 that sum to one, e.g., ˜πm = 1/M for
all m ∈M, and let M be of the prior {˜πm}, so Pr[M = m] = ˜πm for all m ∈M.
Let the conditional law of Y given M be as speciﬁed by the given densities so, in
particular,
fY(y) =

m∈M
˜πm fY|M=m(y),
y ∈Rd.
(22.12)
Since {˜πm} are strictly positive, it follows from (22.12) that

fY(y) = 0

=⇒

fY|M=m(y) = 0,
m ∈M

.
(22.13)
(The only way the sum of nonnegative numbers can be zero is if they are all zero.
Thus, fY(y) = 0 always implies that all the terms {˜πm fY|M=m(y)} are zero. But
if {˜πm} are strictly positive, then this implies that all the terms {fY|M=m(y)} are
zero.)
By the deﬁnition of the functions {ψm(·)} and of the conditional probability (22.4),
we have for every m ∈M

(22.15)
This can be argued as follows. If fY(y) is greater than zero, then (22.15) follows
directly from (22.14). And if fY(y) is equal to zero, then the RHS of (22.15) is
equal to zero and, by (22.13), the LHS is also equal to zero.
3A diﬀerent, perhaps more elegant, way to state the theorem is in terms of probability dis-
tributions. Let Pm be the probability distribution on Rd corresponding to M = m, where m
is in the ﬁnite set M. Assume that {Pm} are dominated by the σ-ﬁnite measure μ. Then the
Borel measurable mapping T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient statistic for the family {Pm} if, and
only if, there exists a Borel measurable nonnegative function h(·) from Rd to R, and M nonneg-
ative, Borel measurable functions gm(·) from Rd′ to R such that for each m ∈M the function
y →gm(T(y)) h(y) is a version of the Radon-Nikodym derivative dPm/ dμ of Pm with respect
to μ; see (Billingsley, 1995, Theorem 34.6) and (Lehmann and Romano, 2005, Corollary 2.6.1).

We next prove that if the densities factorize as in (22.11), then T(·) forms a suﬃ-
cient statistic. That is, we show how using the factorization (22.11) we can design
the desired black box. The inputs to the black box are the prior {πm} and T(y).
The black box considers the vector

(22.16)
If all its components are zero, then the black box produces the uniform distribution
(or any other distribution of the reader’s choice). Otherwise, it produces the above
vector but normalized to sum to one. Thus, if we denote by ψm(π1, . . . , πM, T(y))
the probability that the black box assigns to m when fed π1, . . . , πM and T(y),
then

(22.17)
To verify that ψm(π1, . . . , πM, T(y)) = Pr[M = m|Y = y] whenever y is such that
y /∈Y0 and (22.8) holds, we ﬁrst note that, by the factorization (22.11),

is equal to the vector in (22.16) but scaled so that its components add to one. But
the a posteriori probability vector is also a scaled version of (22.16) (scaled by
h(y)/fY(y)) that sums to one. Thus, if y /∈Y0 and (22.8) holds, then the vector
produced by the black box is identical to the a posteriori distribution vector.
22.3.2
Pairwise suﬃciency
We next clarify the connection between suﬃcient statistics for binary hypothesis

Suﬃcient Statistics
One part of this statement is trivial, namely, that if T(·) is suﬃcient for the family
{fY|M=m(·)}m∈M then it is also suﬃcient for any pair. Indeed, by the Factoriza-
tion Theorem (Theorem 22.3.1), the suﬃciency of T(·) for the family implies the
existence of a set of Lebesgue measure zero Y0 ⊂Rd and functions {gm}m∈M, h
such that for all y ∈Rd \ Y0
fY|M=m(y) = gm

T(y)

h(y),
fY|M=m′′(y) = gm′′
T(y)

h(y),
which, by the Factorization Theorem, implies the suﬃciency of T(·) for the pair of
densities fY|M=m′(·), fY|M=m′′(·).
The nontrivial part of the proposition is that pairwise suﬃciency implies suﬃciency.
Even this is quite easy when the densities are all strictly positive. It is a bit more
tricky without this assumption.4
Proposition 22.3.2 (Pairwise Suﬃciency Implies Suﬃciency). Consider M den-
sities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M on Rd, and assume that T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient
statistic for every pair of densities fY|M=m′(·), fY|M=m′′(·), where m′ ̸= m′′ are
both in M. Then T(·) is a suﬃcient statistic for the M densities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M.
Proof. To prove that T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic for {fY|M=m(·)}M
m=1 we shall
describe an algorithm (black box) that when fed any prior {πm} and T(yobs) (but
not yobs) produces an M-dimensional probability vector that is equal to the a

To describe the algorithm we ﬁrst use the Factorization Theorem (Theorem 22.3.1)
to recast the proposition’s hypothesis as saying that for every pair m′ ̸= m′′ in M
there exists a set Y(m′,m′′)

to describe the algorithm. Note
that yobs is never fed directly to the algorithm; only T(yobs) is used. Let the prior

(22.24)
be given, and assume without loss of generality that it is nondegenerate in the
sense that
πm > 0,
m ∈M.
(22.25)
(If that is not the case, we can set the black box to produce 0 in the coordinates
of the output vector corresponding to messages of prior probability zero and then
proceed to ignore such messages.) Let yobs ∈Rd be arbitrary.
There are two phases to the algorithm. In the ﬁrst phase the algorithm produces
some m∗∈M whose a posteriori probability is guaranteed to be positive when-
ever (22.21) holds. In fact, if (22.21) holds, then no message has an a posteriori
probability higher than that of m∗(but this is immaterial to us because we are
not content with showing that from T(yobs) we can compute the message that a
posteriori has the highest probability; we want to be able to compute the entire
a posteriori probability vector). In the second phase the algorithm uses m∗to
compute the desired a posteriori probability vector.
The ﬁrst phase of the algorithm runs in M steps. In Step 1 we set m[1] = 1. In

Suﬃcient Statistics
If at least one of the components of α[·] is +∞, then we produce as the algorithm’s
output the uniform distribution on M. (The output corresponding to this case is
immaterial because it will turn out that this case is only possible if yobs is such
that either yobs ∈Y0 or 
m πmfY|M=m(yobs) = 0, in which case the algorithm’s
output is not required to be equal to the a posteriori distribution.) Otherwise, the

Since there is nothing to prove if (22.21) does not hold, we shall henceforth assume
for the rest of the proof that it does. In this case we have by (22.4)
Pr[M = m|Y = yobs] = πm fY|M=m(yobs)

m ∈M.
(22.31)
We shall prove (22.30) in two steps. In the ﬁrst step we show that the result m∗
of the algorithm’s ﬁrst phase satisﬁes
Pr[M = m∗|Y = yobs] > 0.

To establish (22.32) we shall prove the stronger statement that

or not. In the former case there is nothing to prove because (22.35) holds irrespec-
tive of whether (22.26) results in m[ν] being set to ν or to m[ν −1]. In the latter
case we have by (22.31) and (22.25) that fY|M=ν(yobs) and fY|M=m[ν−1](yobs)

where the ﬁrst equality follows because h(m[ν−1],ν)(yobs) is strictly positive; the
second because in this part of the proof we are assuming (22.21); and where the
last equality follows from (22.22) and (22.31).
This establishes (22.35), which
implies (22.34), which in turn implies (22.33), which in turn implies (22.32), and
thus concludes the proof of the ﬁrst step.
In the second step of the proof we use (22.32) to establish (22.30).
This is
straightforward because, in view of (22.31), we have that (22.32) implies that
fY|M=m∗(yobs) > 0 so, by (22.22b), we have that
h(m,m∗)(yobs) > 0,

Markov Condition
We now characterize suﬃcient statistics using Markov chains and conditional in-
dependence. These concepts were introduced in Section 20.11. The key result we
ask the reader to recall is Theorem 20.11.3. We rephrase it for our present setting
as follows.

Suﬃcient Statistics
Proposition 22.3.3. The statement that M⊸−
−T(Y)⊸−
−Y forms a Markov chain
is equivalent to each of the following statements:
(a) The conditional distribution of M given

T(Y), Y

is the same as given T(Y).
(b) M and Y are conditionally independent given T(Y).
(c) The conditional distribution of Y given

M,T(Y)

is the same as given T(Y).
Statement (a) can also be written as:
(a’) The conditional distribution of M given Y is the same as given T(Y).
Indeed, the conditional distribution of any random variable—in particular M—
given

T(Y), Y

is the same as given Y only, because T(Y) carries no information
that is not in Y.
Statement (a’) can be rephrased as saying that the conditional distribution of M
given Y can be computed from T(Y). Since this is the key requirement of suﬃcient
statistics, we obtain:
Proposition 22.3.4. A Borel measurable function T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient
statistic for the M densities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M if, and only if, for any prior {πm}
M⊸−
−T(Y)⊸−
−Y
(22.36)
forms a Markov chain.
Proof. The proof of this proposition is omitted. It is not diﬃcult, but it requires
some measure-theoretic tools.5
Using Proposition 22.3.4 and Proposition 22.3.3 (cf. (b)) we obtain that a Borel
measurable function T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on Y if,
and only if, for any prior {πm} on M, the message M and the observation Y are
conditionally independent given T(Y).
We next explore the implications of Proposition 22.3.4 and the equivalence of the
Markovity M⊸−
−T(Y)⊸−
−Y and Statement (c) in Proposition 22.3.3. These imply
that a Borel measurable function T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic if, and only if, the
conditional distribution of Y given

T(Y), M = m

is the same for all m ∈M. Or,
in other words, a Borel measurable function T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic if, and
only if, the conditional distribution of Y given T(Y) does not depend on which
of the densities in {fY|M=m(·)} governs the law of Y. This characterization has
interesting implications regarding the possibility of simulating observables. These
implications are explored next.

is a version of
the conditional probability that M = m conditional on the σ-algebra generated by Y, and it is
also measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by T(Y). The reverse direction follows
from (Lehmann and Romano, 2005, Lemma 2.3.1).

number generator as follows. Using T(yobs) and local randomness Θ, one produces
a ˜Y whose conditional law given M = m is the same as that of Y, for each m ∈M.
One then feeds ˜Y to the given detector.
22.3.4
Simulating Observables
For T(Y) to form a suﬃcient statistic, we do not require that T(·) be invertible, i.e.,
that Y be recoverable from T(Y). Indeed, the notion of suﬃcient statistics is most
useful when this transformation is not invertible, in which case T(·) “summarizes”
the information in the observation Y that is needed for guessing M. Nevertheless,
as we shall next show, if T(Y) forms a suﬃcient statistic, then from T(Y) we
can produce (using a local random number generator) a vector ˜Y that appears
statistically like Y in the sense that the conditional law of ˜Y given M is identical
to the conditional law of Y given M.
To expand on this, we ﬁrst explain what we mean by “we can produce . . . ˜Y” and
then elaborate on the consequences of the vector ˜Y having the same conditional
law given M = m as Y. By “producing” ˜Y from T(Y) we mean that ˜Y is the
result of processing T(Y) with respect to M. Stated diﬀerently, for every t ∈Rd′
there corresponds a probability distribution P ˜Y|t (not dependent on m) that can
be used to generate ˜Y as follows: having observed T(yobs), we use a local random
number generator to generate the vector ˜Y according to the distribution P ˜Y|t,
where t = T(yobs); see Figure 22.2.
By ˜Y appearing statistically the same as Y we mean that the conditional law of ˜Y
given M = m is the same as that of Y, i.e., is of density fY|M=m(·). Consequently,
anything that can be learned about M from Y can also be learned about M from ˜Y.
Also, any guessing device that was designed to guess M based on the input Y will
yield the same probability of error when, instead of being fed Y, it is fed ˜Y. Thus,
if p(error|M = m) is the conditional error probability associated with a guessing
device that is fed Y, then it is also the conditional probability of error that will be
incurred by this device if, rather than Y, it is fed ˜Y; see Figure 22.2.

Suﬃcient Statistics
Before stating this as a theorem, let us consider the following simple example.
Suppose that our observation consists of d random variables Y1, . . . , Yd and that,
conditional on H = 0, these random variables are IID Bernoulli(p0), i.e., they
each take on the value 1 with probability p0 and the value 0 with probability
1 −p0. Conditional on H = 1, these d random variables are IID Bernoulli(p1).
Here 0 < p0, p1 < 1 and p0 ̸= p1. Consequently, the conditional probability mass
functions are

PY1,...,Yd|H=1(y1, . . . , yd) = p

(1 −p1)d−d
j=1 yj,
so T(Y1, . . . , Yd) ≜d
j=1 Yj forms a suﬃcient statistic by the Factorization The-
orem.6
From T(y1, . . . , yd) one cannot recover the sequence y1, . . . , yd. Indeed,
specifying that T(y1, . . . , yd) = t does not determine which of the random vari-
ables is one; it only determines how many of them are one. There are thus
d
t

possible outcomes (y1, . . . yd) that are consistent with T(y1, . . . , yd) being equal to t.
We leave it to the reader to verify that if we use a local random number genera-
tor to pick one of these outcomes uniformly at random then the result ( ˜Y1, . . . ˜Yd)
will have the same conditional law given H as (Y1, . . . , Yd). We do not, of course,
guarantee that ( ˜Y1, . . . ˜Yd) be identical to (Y1, . . . , Yd). (The transformation T(·)
is, after all, not reversible.)
For additional insight let us consider our example of (20.66). For T(y1, y2) = y2
1+y2
2
we can generate ˜Y from a uniform random variable Θ ∼U ([0, 1)) as
˜Y1 =

T(Y) cos

2πΘ

˜Y2 =

T(Y) sin

2πΘ

.
That is, after observing T(yobs) = t, we generate
 ˜Y1, ˜Y2

uniformly over the tuples
that are at radius
√
t from the origin.
This last example also demonstrates the diﬃculty of stating the result. The random
vector Y in this example has a density, both when conditioned on H = 0 and when
conditioned on H = 1. The same applies to the random variable T(Y). However,
the distribution that is used to generate ˜Y from T(Y) is neither discrete nor has
a density. All its mass is concentrated on the circle of radius
√
t, so it cannot have
a density, and it is uniformly distributed over that circle, so it cannot be discrete.
Theorem 22.3.5 (Simulating the Observables from the Suﬃcient Statistic). Let
T : Rd →Rd′ be Borel measurable and let fY|M=1(·), . . . , fY|M=M(·) be M densities
on Rd. Then the following two statements are equivalent:
(a) T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic for the given densities.
6For illustration purposes we are extending the discussion here to discrete distributions.

22.4 Identifying Suﬃcient Statistics

(b) To every t in Rd′ there corresponds a distribution on Rd such that the fol-
lowing holds: for every m ∈{1, . . . , M}, if Y = yobs is generated according
to the density fY|M=m(·) and if the random vector ˜Y is then generated ac-
cording to the distribution corresponding to t, where t = T(yobs), then ˜Y is
of density fY|M=m(·).
Proof. For a measure-theoretic statement and proof see (Lehmann and Romano,
2005, Theorem 2.6.1). Here we only present some intuition. Ignoring some of the
technical details, the proof is very simple. The suﬃciency of T(·) is equivalent
to M⊸−
−T(Y)⊸−
−Y forming a Markov chain for every prior on M. This latter
condition is equivalent by Proposition 22.3.3 (cf. (c)) to the conditional distribution
of Y given

T(Y), M

being the same as given T(Y) only. This latter condition
is equivalent to the conditional distribution of Y given T(Y) not depending on
which density in the family {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M was used to generate Y, i.e., to the
existence of a conditional distribution of Y given T(Y) that does not depend on
m ∈M.
22.4
Identifying Suﬃcient Statistics
Often a suﬃcient statistic can be identiﬁed without having to compute and factorize
the conditional densities of the observation. A number of such cases are described
in this section.
22.4.1
Invertible Transformation
We begin by showing that, ignoring some technical details, any invertible transfor-
mation forms a suﬃcient statistic. It may not be a particularly helpful suﬃcient
statistic because it does not “summarize” the observation, but it is a suﬃcient
statistic nonetheless.
Proposition 22.4.1 (Reversible Transformations Yield Suﬃcient Statistics). If
T : Rd →Rd′ is Borel measurable with a Borel measurable inverse, then T(·) forms
a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on Y.
Proof. We provide two proofs. The ﬁrst uses the deﬁnition. We need to verify that
from T(yobs) one can compute the conditional distribution of M given Y = yobs.
This is obvious because if t = T(yobs), then one can compute Pr[M = m|Y = yobs]
from t by ﬁrst applying the inverse T −1(t) to recover yobs and by then substituting
the result in the expression for Pr[M = m|Y = yobs] (22.4).
A second proof can be based on Proposition 22.3.4. We need to verify that for any
prior {πm}
M⊸−
−T(Y)⊸−
−Y
forms a Markov chain. To this end we note that, by Proposition 22.3.3, it suﬃces
to verify that M and Y are conditionally independent given T(Y). This is clear
because the invertibility of T(·) guarantees that, conditional on T(Y), the random
vector Y is deterministic and hence independent of any random variable and a
fortiori of M.

Suﬃcient Statistics
22.4.2
A Suﬃcient Statistic Is Computable from the Statistic
Intuitively, we think about T(·) as forming a suﬃcient statistic if T(Y) contains
all the information about Y that is relevant to guessing M. For this intuition to
make sense it had better be the case that if T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic for
guessing M based on Y, and if T(Y) is computable from S(Y), then S(·) also
forms a suﬃcient statistic. Fortunately, this is so:
Proposition 22.4.2. Suppose that a Borel measurable mapping T : Rd →Rd′ forms
a suﬃcient statistic for the M densities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M on Rd. Let the mapping
S : Rd →Rd′′ be Borel measurable. If T(·) can be written as the composition ψ ◦S
of S with some Borel measurable function ψ: Rd′′ →Rd′, then S(·) also forms a
suﬃcient statistic for these densities.
Proof. We need to show that Pr[M = m|Y = yobs] is computable from S(yobs).
This follows because, by assumption, T(yobs) is computable from S(yobs) and
because the suﬃciency of T(·) implies that Pr[M = m|Y = yobs] is computable
from T(yobs).
22.4.3
Establishing Suﬃciency in Two Steps
It is sometimes convenient to establish suﬃciency in two steps: in the ﬁrst step
we establish that T(Y) is suﬃcient for guessing M based on Y, and in the second
step we establish that S(T) is suﬃcient for guessing M based on T(Y).
The
next proposition demonstrates that it then follows that S(T(Y)) forms a suﬃcient
statistic for guessing M based on Y.
Proposition 22.4.3. If T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient statistic for the M densities
{fY|M=m(·)}m∈M and if S : Rd′ →Rd′′ forms a suﬃcient statistic for the corre-
sponding family of densities of T(Y), then the composition S ◦T forms a suﬃcient
statistic for the densities {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M.
Proof. We shall establish the suﬃciency of S◦T by proving that for any prior {πm}

This follows because for every m ∈M and every yobs ∈Rd

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the suﬃciency of S(T(Y)) for guessing M
based on T(Y), and where the second equality follows from the suﬃciency of T(Y)
for guessing M based on Y.

the distribution of the observable Y is determined by the value of a k-tuple of bits
(D1, . . . , Dk). Thus, to each outcome (d1, . . . , dk) ∈{0, 1}k among the 2k diﬀer-
ent outcomes of (D1, . . . , Dk) there corresponds a distribution on Y of some given
density fY|D1=d1,...,Dk=dk(·). Suppose now that T(·) forms a suﬃcient statistic for
this family of M = 2k densities. The result we next describe guarantees that T(·)
is also suﬃcient for the binary hypothesis testing problem of guessing whether a
speciﬁc bit Dj is zero or one. More precisely, we shall show that if {π(d1,...,dk)}
is any nondegenerate prior on the 2k diﬀerent k-tuples of bits, then T(·) forms a
suﬃcient statistic for the two densities

The factorization (22.39) of the densities in (22.37) proves that T(·) is also suﬃcient

Suppose that T(·) is suﬃcient for the family {fY|M=m(·)}m∈M. Let K1, . . . , Kκ be

22.4.5
Conditionally Independent Observations
Our next result deals with a situation where we need to guess M based on two
observations: Y1 and Y2. We assume that T1(Y1) forms a suﬃcient statistic for
guessing M when only Y1 is observed, and that T2(Y2) forms a suﬃcient statistic
for guessing M when only Y2 is observed. It is tempting to conjecture that in
this case the pair (T1(Y1), T2(Y2)) must form a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M
when both Y1 and Y2 are observed. But, without additional assumptions, this is
not the case. An example where this fails can be constructed as follows. Let M
and Z be independent with M taking on the values 0 and 1 equiprobably and with
Z ∼N(0, 1). Suppose that Y1 = M +Z and that Y2 = Z. In this case the invertible
mapping T1(Y1) = Y1 forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on Y1 alone,
and the mapping T2(Y2) = 17 forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based
on Y2 alone (because M and Z are independent). Nevertheless, the pair (Y1, 17) is
not suﬃcient for guessing M based on the pair (Y1, Y2). Basing one’s guess of M on
(Y1, 17) is not as good as basing it on the pair (Y1, Y2). (The reader is encouraged
to verify that Y1 −Y2 is suﬃcient for guessing M based on (Y1, Y2) and that M
can be guessed error-free from Y1 −Y2.)
The additional assumption we need is that Y1 and Y2 be conditionally independent
given M. (It would make no sense to assume that they are independent, because
they are presumably both related to M.) This assumption is valid in many appli-
cations. For example, it occurs when a signal is received at two diﬀerent antennas
with the additive noises in the two antennas being independent.

Proposition 22.4.6 (Conditionally Independent Observations). Let the mapping

1 form a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on the observation
Y1 ∈Rd1, and let T2 : Rd2 →Rd′

then the pair (T1(Y1), T2(Y2)) forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on
the pair (Y1, Y2).
Proof. The proof we oﬀer is based on the Factorization Theorem. The hypothesis

(The suﬃciency of T(·) can also be demonstrated by ﬁrst showing pairwise suﬃ-

can use the expression for the LLR (20.83) to show that the LLR is computable
from T(y).)
If the vectors {sm} are linearly dependent, then we can ﬁnd a more succinct suf-
ﬁcient statistic. Indeed, if ˜s1, . . . ,˜sn are vectors in RJ whose span includes all the
vectors s1, . . . , sM, then for each m ∈M we can ﬁnd coeﬃcients α(1)

Consequently,

forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on Y. We have thus established:
Proposition 22.5.1 (Multi-Dimensional M-ary Gaussian Problem: Suﬃciency).
Consider the setup of Section 21.6.1. If ˜s1, . . . ,˜sn ∈RJ are such that
sm ∈span (˜s1, . . . ,˜sn) ,
m ∈M,
then
y 	→

⟨y,˜s1⟩E , . . . , ⟨y,˜sn⟩E
T
forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on Y.
22.6
Irrelevant Data
Closely related to the notion of suﬃcient statistics is the notion of irrelevant data.
This notion is particularly useful when we think about the data as consisting of
two parts.
Heuristically speaking, we say that the second part of the data is
irrelevant for guessing M given the ﬁrst, if it adds no information about M that
is not already contained in the ﬁrst part. In such cases the second part of the
data can be ignored. It should be emphasized that the question whether a part
of the observation is irrelevant depends not only on its dependence on the random
variable to be guessed but also on the other part of the observation.
Deﬁnition 22.6.1 (Irrelevant Data). We say that R is irrelevant for guessing M
given Y, if Y forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on (Y, R).
Equivalently, R is irrelevant for guessing M given Y, if for any prior {πm} on M

M⊸−

. Rather than thinking of this problem as a decision problem with a single
observation, let us think of it as a decision problem with two observations (Y1, Y2),
where Y1 is the absolute value of Y , and where Y2 is the sign of Y . Thus Y = Y1 Y2,

where Y1 ≥0 and Y2 ∈{+1, −1}. (The probability that Y = 0 is zero under each
hypothesis, so we need not deﬁne the sign of zero.) We now show that Y2 (= the
sign of Y ) is irrelevant data for guessing H given Y1 (= the magnitude of Y ). Or,
in other words, the magnitude of Y is a suﬃcient statistic for guessing H based on
(Y1, Y2). Indeed the likelihood-ratio function

can be computed from the magnitude y1 only, so Y1 is a suﬃcient statistic for

The following two notes clarify that the notion of irrelevance is diﬀerent from that
of statistical independence. Neither implies the other.
Note 22.6.3. A RV can be independent of the RV that we wish to guess and yet
not be irrelevant.
Proof. We provide an example of a RV R that is independent of the RV H that
we wish to guess and that is nonetheless not irrelevant. Suppose that H takes on
the values 0 and 1, and assume that under both hypotheses Y ∼Bernoulli(1/2):
Pr

Y = 1
 H = 0

= Pr

Y = 1
 H = 1

= 1
2.
Further assume that under H = 0 the RV R is given by 0 ⊕Y = Y , whereas under
H = 1 it is given by 1 ⊕Y . Here ⊕denotes the exclusive-or operation or mod-2
addition.
The distribution of R does not depend on the hypothesis; it is Bernoulli(1/2) both
conditional on H = 0 and conditional on H = 1.
But R is not irrelevant for
guessing H given Y . In fact, if we had to guess H based on Y only, our probability
of error would be 1/2. But if we base our decision on Y and R, then our probability
of error is zero because
H = Y ⊕R.
Note 22.6.4. A RV can be irrelevant even if it is statistically dependent on the
RV that we wish to guess.
Proof. As an example, consider the case where R is equal to Y with probability one
and that Y (and hence also R) is statistically dependent on the RV M that we wish
to guess. Since R is deterministically equal to Y , it follows that, conditional on Y ,
the random variable R is deterministic. Consequently, since a deterministic RV is
independent of every RV, it follows that M and R are conditionally independent

given Y , i.e., that (22.47) holds. Thus, even though in this example R is statistically
dependent on M, it is irrelevant for guessing M given Y . The intuitive explanation
is that, in this example, R is irrelevant for guessing M given Y not because it
conveys no information about M (it does!) but because it conveys no information
about M that is not already conveyed by Y .
Condition (22.46) is often diﬃcult to establish directly, especially when the distri-
bution of the pair (R, Y) is speciﬁed in terms of its conditional density given M,
because in this case the conditional law of (M, R) given Y can be unwieldy. In
some cases the following proposition can be used to establish that R is irrelevant.
Proposition 22.6.5 (A Condition that Implies Irrelevance). Suppose that the con-
ditional law of R given M = m does not depend on m and that, for each m ∈M,
we have that, conditionally on M = m, the observations Y and R are independent.
Then R is irrelevant for guessing M given Y.
Proof. We provide the proof for the case where the pair (Y, R) has a conditional
density given M. The discrete case or the mixed case (where one has a conditional
density and the other a conditional PMF) can be treated with the same approach.
To prove this proposition we shall demonstrate that Y is a suﬃcient statistic for
guessing H based on (Y, R) using the Factorization Theorem. To that end, we
express the conditional density of (Y, R) as
fY,R|M=m(y, r) = fY|M=m(y) fR|M=m(r)
= fY|M=m(y) fR(r)
= gm(y) h(y, r),
(22.48)
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the conditional independence of Y and R
given M; the second from the hypothesis that the conditional density of R given
M = m does not depend on m and by denoting this density by fR(·); and the
ﬁnal equality follows by deﬁning gm(y) ≜fY|M=m(y) and h(y, r) ≜fR(r). The
factorization (22.48) demonstrates that Y forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M
based on (Y, R), i.e., that R is irrelevant for guessing M given Y.
22.7
Testing with Random Parameters
The notions of suﬃcient statistics and irrelevance also apply when testing in the
presence of a random parameter.

then T(Y) is suﬃcient if, and only if, for any prior {πm} on M

The following lemma provides an easily-veriﬁable condition that guarantees that R
is irrelevant for guessing H based on Y, irrespective of whether the random pa-
rameter is observed or not.
Lemma 22.7.1. If for any prior {πm} on M we have that R is independent of the
triple (M, Θ, Y),8 then R is irrelevant for guessing M given (Θ, Y) and also for
guessing M given Y.
Proof. To prove the lemma when Θ is observed, we need to show that the inde-
pendence of R and the triple (M, Θ, Y) implies
M⊸−
−(Y, Θ)⊸−
−R,
i.e., that the conditional distribution of R given (Y, Θ) is the same as given
(M, Y, Θ).
This is indeed the case because R is independent of (M, Y, Θ) so
the two conditional distributions are equal to the unconditional distribution of R.
To prove the lemma in the case where Θ is unobserved, we need to show that the
independence of R and the triple (M, Θ, Y) implies that
M⊸−
−Y⊸−
−R.
8Note that being independent of the triple is a stronger condition than being independent of
each of the members of the triple!

Chapter 23
The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
23.1
Introduction
The multivariate Gaussian distribution is arguably the most important multi-
variate distribution in Digital Communications. It is the extension of the univariate
Gaussian distribution from scalars to vectors. A random vector of this distribu-
tion is said to be a Gaussian vector, and its components are said to be jointly
Gaussian. In this chapter we shall deﬁne this distribution, provide some useful
characterizations, and study some of its key properties.
To emphasize its con-
nection to the univariate distribution, we shall derive it along the same lines we
followed in deriving the univariate Gaussian distribution in Chapter 19.
There are a number of equivalent ways to deﬁne the multivariate Gaussian distri-
bution, and authors typically pick one deﬁnition and then proceed over the course
of numerous pages to derive alternate characterizations. We shall also proceed in
this way, but to satisfy the impatient reader’s curiosity we shall state the various
equivalent deﬁnitions in this section. The proof of their equivalence will be spread
over the whole chapter.
In the following deﬁnition we use the notation introduced in Section 17.2.
In
particular, all vectors are column vectors, and we denote the components of the
vector a ∈Rn by a(1), . . . , a(n).
Deﬁnition 23.1.1 (Standard Gaussians, Centered Gaussians, and Gaussians).
(i) A random vector W taking values in Rn is said to be a standard Gaussian
if its n components W (1), . . . , W (n) are independent and each is a zero-mean
unit-variance univariate Gaussian.
(ii) A random vector X taking values in Rn is said to be a centered Gaussian
if there exists some deterministic n × m matrix A such that the distribution
of X is the same as the distribution of AW, i.e.,
X
L= AW,
(23.1)
where W is a standard Gaussian with m components.

23.2 Notation and Preliminaries
495
(iii) A random vector X taking values in Rn is said to be Gaussian if there exists
some deterministic n × m matrix A and some deterministic vector μ ∈Rn
such that the distribution of X is equal to the distribution of AW + μ, i.e., if
X
L= AW + μ,
(23.2)
where W is a standard Gaussian with m components.
The random vectors AW + μ and X can have identical laws only if they have
identical mean vectors. As we shall see, the linearity of expectation and the fact
that a standard Gaussian is of zero mean imply that the mean vector of AW + μ
is equal to μ. Thus, AW + μ and X can have identical laws only if μ = E[X].
Consequently, X is a Gaussian random vector if, and only if, for some A and W
as above X
L= AW + E[X]. Stated diﬀerently, X is a Gaussian random vector if,
and only if, X −E[X] is a centered Gaussian.
While Deﬁnition 23.1.1 allows for the matrix A to be rectangular, we shall see in
Corollary 23.6.13 that every centered Gaussian can be generated from a standard
Gaussian by multiplication by a square matrix. That is, if X is an n-dimensional
centered Gaussian, then there exists an n×n square matrix A such that X
L= AW,
where W is a standard Gaussian.
In fact, we shall see in Theorem 23.6.14 that we can even limit ourselves to square
matrices that are the product of an orthogonal matrix by a diagonal matrix. Since
multiplying W by a diagonal matrix merely scales its components while leaving
them independent and Gaussian, it follows that X is a centered Gaussian if, and
only if, its law is the same as the law of the result of applying an orthogonal
transformation to a random vector whose components are independent zero-mean
univariate Gaussians (not necessarily of equal variance).
In view of Deﬁnition 23.1.1, it is not surprising that applying a linear transfor-
mation to a Gaussian vector results in a Gaussian vector ((23.49) ahead). The
reverse is perhaps more surprising: X is a Gaussian vector if, and only if, the re-
sult of applying any deterministic linear functional to X has a univariate Gaussian
distribution (Theorem 23.6.17 ahead).
We conclude this section with the following pact with the reader.
(i) Unless preceded by the word “random” or “Gaussian,” all scalars, vectors,
and matrices in this chapter are deterministic.
(ii) Unless preceded by the word “complex,” all scalars, vectors, and matrices in
this chapter are real.
But, without violating this pact, we shall sometimes get excited and throw in the
words “real” and “deterministic” even when unnecessary.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
Deterministic vectors are denoted by boldface lowercase letters such as w, whereas
random vectors are denoted by boldface uppercase letters such as W. When we
deal with deterministic matrices we make an exception to our rule of trying to
denote deterministic quantities by lowercase letters.1 Thus, deterministic matrices
are denoted by uppercase letters. But to make it clear that we are dealing with
a deterministic matrix and not a scalar random variable, we use special fonts to
distinguish the two. Thus A denotes a deterministic matrix, whereas A denotes a
random variable. Random matrices, which only appear brieﬂy in this book, are
denoted by uppercase letters of yet another font, e.g., H.
An n × m deterministic real matrix A is an array of real numbers having n rows
and m columns
A =
⎛
⎜
⎜
⎜
⎝
a(1,1)
a(1,2)
. . .
a(1,m)
a(2,1)
a(2,2)

...
...
...
...
a(n,1)
a(n,2)
. . .
a(n,m)
⎞
⎟
⎟
⎟
⎠.
The Row-j Column-ℓelement of the matrix A is denoted
a(j,ℓ)
or
[A]j,ℓ.
The transpose of an n×m matrix A is the m×n matrix AT whose Row-j Column-ℓ
entry is equal to the Row-ℓColumn-j entry of A:
[AT]j,ℓ= [A]ℓ,j,
j ∈{1, . . . , m}, ℓ∈{1, . . . , n}.
We shall repeatedly use the fact that if the matrix-product AB is deﬁned (i.e., if
the number of columns of A is the same as the number of rows of B), then the
transpose of the product is the product of the transposes in reverse order
(AB)T = BTAT.
(23.3)
The n × n identity matrix whose diagonal elements are all 1 and whose oﬀ-
diagonal elements are all 0 is denoted In. The all-zero matrix whose components
are all zero is denoted 0.
An n × 1 matrix is an n-vector, or a vector for short.
Thus, unless otherwise
speciﬁed, all the vectors we shall encounter are column vectors.2 The components
of an n-vector a are denoted by a(1), . . . , a(n) so
a =
⎛
⎜
⎝
a(1)
...
a(n)
⎞
⎟
⎠,
or, in a typographically more eﬃcient form,
a =

a(1), . . . , a(n)T.
1We have already made some exceptions to this rule when we dealt with deterministic con-
stants that are by convention always denoted using uppercase letters, e.g., bandwidth W, ampli-
tude A, baud period Ts, etc.
2An exception to this rule is in our treatment of linear codes where the tradition of using row
vectors is too strong to change.

23.3 Some Results on Matrices

The vector whose components are all zero is denoted by 0. The square root of the
sum of the squares of the components of a real n-vector a is denoted by ∥a∥:

(23.5)
Note the diﬀerence between aTa and aaT: the former is the scalar ∥a∥2 whereas
the latter is the n × n matrix whose Row-j Column-ℓelement is a(j)a(ℓ).
The determinant of a square matrix A is denoted by det A. We note that a matrix
and its transpose have equal determinants
det

AT
= det A,
(23.6)
and that the determinant of the product of two square matrices is the product of
the determinants
det (AB) = det (A) det (B).
(23.7)
We say that a square n × n matrix A is singular if its determinant is zero or,
equivalently, if its columns are linearly dependent or, equivalently, if its rows are
linearly dependent or, equivalently, if there exists some nonzero vector α ∈Rn
such that Aα = 0.
23.3
Some Results on Matrices
We next survey some of the results from Matrix Theory that we shall be using. Par-
ticularly important to us are results on positive semideﬁnite matrices, because, as
we shall see in Proposition 23.6.1, every covariance matrix is positive semideﬁnite,
and every positive semideﬁnite matrix is the covariance matrix of some random
vector.
3In (20.84) we denoted aTb by ⟨a, b⟩E.

23.3.1
Orthogonal Matrices
Deﬁnition 23.3.1 (Orthogonal Matrices). An n × n real matrix U is said to be
orthogonal if its transpose is its inverse
UUT = In.
(23.8)
As proved in (Axler, 2015, Section 7.C, Theorem 7.42), the condition (23.8) is
equivalent to the condition
UTU = In.
(23.9)
Thus, a real matrix is orthogonal if, and only if, its transpose is orthogonal.
If we write an n × n matrix U in terms of its columns as
U =
⎛

then (23.9) can be expressed as

ν, ν′ ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(23.10)
Using the same argument but starting with (23.8) we can prove a similar result
about the rows of an orthogonal matrix: if the rows of a real n × n matrix U are
denoted by φT

then U is orthogonal if, and only if,
φT
ν φν′ = I{ν = ν′},
ν, ν′ ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(23.11)
Recalling that the determinant of a product of square matrices is the product of
the determinants and that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant
of its transpose, we obtain that for every square matrix U
det

UUT
=

det U
2.
(23.12)
Consequently, by taking the determinant of both sides of (23.8) we obtain that the
determinant of an orthogonal matrix must be either +1 or −1. It should, however,
be noted that there are numerous examples of matrices of unit determinant that
are not orthogonal.
We leave it to the reader to verify that a 2 × 2 matrix is orthogonal if, and only if,
it is equal to one of the following matrices for some choice of −π ≤θ < π
	
cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ

,
	
cos θ

and has determinant −1.
23.3.2
Symmetric Matrices
A matrix A is said to be symmetric if it is equal to its transpose:
AT = A.
Only square matrices can be symmetric. A vector ψ ∈Rn is said to be an eigen-
vector of the matrix A corresponding to the real eigenvalue λ ∈R if ψ is nonzero
and if Aψ = λψ. The following is a key result about the eigenvectors of symmetric
real matrices.
Proposition 23.3.2 (Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues of Symmetric Real Matrices).
If A is a symmetric real n × n matrix, then A has n (not necessarily distinct)
real eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λn ∈R with corresponding eigenvectors ψ1, . . . , ψn ∈Rn
satisfying
ψT
ν ψν′ = I{ν = ν′},
ν, ν′ ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(23.14)
Proof. See, for example, (Axler, 2015, Section 7.B, Theorem 7.29), or (Herstein,
1975, Section 6.10, pp. 346–348), or (Horn and Johnson, 2013, Section 4.1, Theo-
rem 4.1.5).

The vectors ψ1, . . . , ψn are eigenvectors of the matrix A corresponding to the eigen-
values λ1, . . . , λn if

Consequently, Condition (23.15) can be written as
AU = UΛ,
(23.16)

(23.17)
Condition (23.14) is equivalent to the condition that the above matrix U is orthog-
onal. By multiplying (23.16) from the right by the inverse of U (which, because U
is orthogonal and by (23.8), is UT) we obtain the equivalent form A = UΛUT.
Consequently, an equivalent statement of Proposition 23.3.2 is:
Proposition 23.3.3 (Spectral Theorem for Real Symmetric Matrices). A sym-
metric real n × n matrix A can be written in the form
A = UΛUT
where, as in (23.17), Λ is a diagonal real n × n matrix whose diagonal elements
are the eigenvalues of A, and where U is a real n × n orthogonal matrix whose ν-th
column is an eigenvector of A corresponding to the eigenvalue in the ν-th position
on the diagonal of Λ.
The reverse is also true: if A = UΛUT for a real diagonal matrix Λ and for a real
orthogonal matrix U, then A is symmetric, its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements
of Λ, and the ν-th column of U is an eigenvector of the matrix A corresponding to
the eigenvalue in the ν-th position on the diagonal of Λ.

Deﬁnition 23.3.4 (Positive Semideﬁnite and Positive Deﬁnite Matrices).

Proposition 23.3.5 (Characterizing Positive Semideﬁnite Matrices). Let K be a
real n × n matrix. Then the statement that K is positive semideﬁnite is equivalent

(b) The matrix K is symmetric and all its eigenvalues are nonnegative.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
(c) The matrix K can be written in the form
K = UΛUT,
where Λ is a real n × n diagonal matrix with positive entries on the diagonal
and where U is a real n × n orthogonal matrix.
Given a positive semideﬁnite matrix K, how can we ﬁnd a matrix S satisfying
K = STS? In general, there can be many such matrices. For example, if K is the
identity matrix, then S can be any orthogonal matrix. We mention here two useful
choices. Being symmetric, the matrix K can be written in the form
K = UΛUT,
(23.20)
where U and Λ are as in (23.17). Since K is positive semideﬁnite, the diagonal
elements of Λ (which are the eigenvalues of K) are nonnegative. Consequently, we
can deﬁne the matrix

One choice of the matrix S is
S = Λ1/2UT.

Indeed, with this deﬁnition of S we have
STS =

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of S; the second from the rule
(AB)T = BTAT and from the symmetry of the diagonal matrix Λ1/2; the third from
the deﬁnition of Λ1/2; and where the ﬁnal equality follows from (23.20).
A diﬀerent choice for S, which will be less useful to us in this chapter, is5
UΛ1/2UT.
The following lemmas will be used in Section 23.4.3 when we study random vectors
of singular covariance matrices.
Lemma 23.3.7. Let K be a real n × n positive semideﬁnite matrix, and let α be a
vector in Rn. Then αTKα = 0 if, and only if, Kα = 0.
5This is the only choice for S that is positive semideﬁnite (Axler, 2015, Section 7.C, Theo-
rem 7.36), (Horn and Johnson, 2013, Section 7.2, Theorem 7.2.6).

Proof. One direction is trivial and does not require that K be positive semideﬁnite:
if Kα = 0, then αTKα must also be equal to zero. Indeed, in this case we have by
the associativity of matrix multiplication αTKα = αT(Kα) = αT0 = 0.
To prove the other direction, we ﬁrst note that, since K is positive semideﬁnite,
there exists some n × n matrix S such that K = STS. Hence,
αTKα = αTSTSα
= (Sα)T(Sα)
= ∥Sα∥2 ,
α ∈Rn,
where the second equality follows from the rule for transposing a product (23.3),
and where the third equality follows from (23.5). Consequently, if αTKα = 0, then
∥Sα∥2 = 0, so Sα = 0, and hence STSα = 0, i.e., Kα = 0.
Lemma 23.3.8. If K is a real n × n positive deﬁnite matrix, then αTKα = 0 if,
and only if, α = 0.
Proof. Follows directly from Deﬁnition 23.3.4 of positive deﬁnite matrices.

Random Vectors
23.4.1
Deﬁnitions
Recall that an n-dimensional random vector or a random n-vector X de-
ﬁned over the probability space (Ω, F, P) is a (measurable) mapping from the set
of experiment outcomes Ω to the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. A random
vector X is very much like a random variable, except that rather than taking values
in the real line R, it takes values in Rn. In fact, an n-dimensional random vector
can be viewed as an array of n random variables.6
The density of a random vector is the joint density of its components. The density
of a random n-vector is thus a nonnegative (Borel measurable) function from Rn
to the nonnegative reals that integrates to one.
Similarly, an n×m random matrix H is an n×m array of random variables deﬁned
over a common probability space.
23.4.2
Expectations and Covariance Matrices
The expectation E[X] of a random n-vector X = (X(1), . . . , X(n))T is a vector
whose components are the expectations of the corresponding components of X:7
E[X] ≜

E

X(1)
, . . . , E

X(n)T
.
(23.22)
6In dealing with random vectors one often abandons the “coordinate free” approach and views
vectors in a particular coordinate system. This allows one to speak of the covariance matrix in
more familiar terms.
7The expectation of a random vector is only deﬁned if the expectation of each of its compo-
nents is deﬁned.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
The j-th element of E[X] is thus the expectation of the j-th component of X,
namely, E

X(j)
. Similarly, the expectation of a random matrix is the matrix of
expectations.
If all the components of a random n-vector X are of ﬁnite variance, then we say
that X is of ﬁnite variance. We then deﬁne its n × n covariance matrix KXX
as

If n = 1 and the n-dimensional random vector X hence a scalar, then the covariance
matrix KXX is a 1 × 1 matrix whose sole component is the variance of the sole
component of X.
Note that, from the n×n covariance matrix KXX of a random n-vector X, it is easy
to compute the covariance matrix of a subset of X’s components. For example, if
we are only interested in the 2 × 2 covariance matrix of (X(1), X(2))T, then we just
pick the ﬁrst two columns and the ﬁrst two rows of KXX. More generally, the r × r
covariance matrix of (X(j1), X(j2), . . . , X(jr))T for 1 ≤j1 < j2 < · · · < jr ≤n is
obtained from KXX by picking Rows and Columns j1, . . . , jr. For example, if

We next explore the behavior of the mean vector and the covariance matrix of
a random vector when it is multiplied by a deterministic matrix. Regarding the
mean, we shall show that since matrix multiplication is a linear transformation, it
commutes with the expectation operation. Consequently, if H is a random n × m
matrix and A is a deterministic ν × n matrix, then
E[AH] = AE[H] ,
(23.25a)
and similarly if B is a deterministic m × ν matrix, then
E[HB] = E[H] B.

To prove (23.25a) we write out the Row-j Column-ℓelement of the ν × m ma-

The proof of (23.25b) is almost identical and is omitted.
The transpose operation also commutes with expectation: if H is a random matrix
then
E

HT
= (E[H])T .
(23.26)
As to the covariance matrix, we next show that if A is a deterministic matrix and
if X is a random vector, then the covariance matrix KYY of the random vector
Y = AX can be expressed in terms of the covariance matrix KXX of X as
KYY = A KXX AT,
Y = AX.
(23.27)
Indeed,
KYY ≜E

A key property of covariance matrices is that, as we shall next show, they are all
positive semideﬁnite. That is, the covariance matrix KXX of any random vector X
is a symmetric matrix satisfying
αT KXX α ≥0,
α ∈Rn.
(23.28)
(In Proposition 23.6.1 we shall see that this property fully characterizes covari-
ance matrices: every positive semideﬁnite matrix is the covariance matrix of some
random vector.)
To prove (23.28) it suﬃces to consider the case where X is of zero mean because
the covariance matrix of X is the same as the covariance matrix of X −E[X]. The

symmetry of KXX follows from the deﬁnition of the covariance matrix (23.23); from
the fact that expectation and transposition commute (23.26); and from the formula
for the transpose of a product of matrices (23.3):

The nonnegativity of αT KXX α for any deterministic α ∈Rn follows by noting
that by (23.27) (applied with A = αT) the term αT KXX α is the variance of the
scalar random variable αTX, i.e.,
αT KXX α = Var

αTX

(23.30)
and, as such, is nonnegative.
23.4.3
Singular Covariance Matrices
A random vector having a singular covariance matrix can be unwieldy because
it cannot have a probability density function. Indeed, as we shall see in Corol-
lary 23.4.2, any such random vector has at least one component that is determined
(with probability one) by the other components. In this section we shall propose
a way of manipulating such vectors. Roughly speaking, the idea is that if X has a
singular covariance matrix, then we choose a subset of its components so that the
covariance matrix of the chosen subset be nonsingular and so that each compo-
nent that was not chosen be equal (with probability one) to a deterministic aﬃne
function of the chosen components. We then manipulate only the chosen compo-
nents and, with some deterministic bookkeeping “on the side,” take care of the
components that were not chosen. This idea is made precise in Corollary 23.4.3.
To illustrate the idea, suppose that X is a zero-mean random vector of covariance
matrix
KXX =
⎛

with probability one.

Consequently, in manipulating X we can pick the two components X(2), X(3),
which are of nonsingular covariance matrix

13 19

(obtained by picking the last
two rows and the last two columns of KXX), and keep track “on the side” of the
fact that X(1) is equal, with probability one, to 2X(2) −X(3). We could, of course,
also pick the components X(1), X(2) of nonsingular covariance matrix
 3 5
5 9

and
keep track “on the side” of the relationship X(3) = 2X(2) −X(1).
To avoid cumbersome language, for the remainder of this section we shall take all
equalities between random variables to stand for equalities with probability one.
Thus, if we write X(1) = 2X(2) −X(3) we mean that the probability that X(1) is
equal to 2X(2) −X(3) is one.
The justiﬁcation of the procedure is in the following proposition and its two corol-
laries.
Proposition 23.4.1. Let X be a zero-mean random n-vector of covariance ma-
trix KXX. Then its ℓ-th component X(ℓ) is equal (with probability one) to a linear
combination of X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓη) if, and only if, the ℓ-th column of KXX is a linear
combination of Columns ℓ1, . . . , ℓη. Here ℓ, η, ℓ1, . . . , ℓη ∈{1, . . . , n} are arbitrary.
Proof. If ℓ∈{ℓ1, . . . , ℓη}, then the result is trivial. We shall therefore present a
proof only for the case where ℓ/∈{ℓ1, . . . , ℓη}. In this case, the ℓ-th component of
the random n-vector X is a linear combination of the η components X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓη)
if, and only if, there exists a vector α ∈Rn satisfying
α(ℓ) = −1,
(23.31a)
α(κ) = 0,
κ /∈{ℓ, ℓ1, . . . , ℓη} ,
(23.31b)
and
αTX = 0.
(23.31c)
Since X is of zero mean, the condition αTX = 0 is equivalent to the condition
Var

αTX

= 0. By (23.30) and Lemma 23.3.7 this latter condition is equivalent
to the condition KXX α = 0. Now KXX α is a linear combination of the columns
of KXX where the ﬁrst column is multiplied by α(1), the second by α(2), etc. Con-
sequently, the condition that KXX α = 0 for some α ∈Rn satisfying (23.31a) &
(23.31b) is equivalent to the condition that the ℓ-th column of KXX is a linear
combination of Columns ℓ1, . . . , ℓη.
Corollary 23.4.2. The covariance matrix of a zero-mean random n-vector X is
singular if, and only if, some component of X is a linear combination of the other
components.
Proof. Follows from Proposition 23.4.1 by noting that a square matrix is singular
if, and only if, its columns are linearly dependent.
Corollary 23.4.3. Let X be a zero-mean random n-vector of covariance matrix KXX.
If Columns ℓ1, . . . , ℓd of KXX form a basis for the subspace of Rn spanned by the
columns of KXX, then every component of X can be written as a linear combination
of the components X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓd), and the random d-vector

X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓd)T
has a nonsingular d × d covariance matrix.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
Proof. Since Columns ℓ1, . . . , ℓd form a basis for the subspace spanned by the
columns of KXX, every column ℓcan be written as a linear combination of these
columns. Consequently, by Proposition 23.4.1, every component of X can be writ-
ten as a linear combination of X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓd). To prove that the d × d covariance
matrix K˜X˜X of the random d-vector ˜X =

X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓd)T is nonsingular, we
note that if this were not the case, then by Corollary 23.4.2 applied to ˜X it would
follow that one of the components of ˜X is a linear combination of the other d −1
components. But by Proposition 23.4.1 applied to X, this would imply that the
columns ℓ1, . . . , ℓd of KXX are not linearly independent, in contradiction to the
corollary’s hypothesis that they form a basis.
23.4.4
The Characteristic Function
If X is a random n-vector, then its characteristic function ΦX(·) is a mapping
from Rn to C that maps each vector ϖ = (ϖ(1), . . . ϖ(n))T in Rn to ΦX(ϖ), where

2π’s and the sign of i).

random n-vectors X, Y are of the same distribution if, and only if, they have
identical characteristic functions:

(23.32)
Proof. See (Dudley, 2003, Chapter 9, Section 5, Theorem 9.5.1).
This proposition is extremely useful. We shall demonstrate its power by using it
to show that two random variables X and Y are independent if, and only if,

One direction is straightforward. If X and Y are independent, then for any Borel
measurable functions g(·) and h(·) the random variables g(X) and h(Y ) are also
independent. Thus, the independence of X and Y implies the independence of the

As to the other direction, suppose that X′ has the same law as X, that Y ′ has the

as X, it follows that

where the third equality follows from (23.34) and (23.35).
We thus see that if (23.33) holds, then the characteristic function of the vector
(X, Y )T is identical to the characteristic function of the vector (X′, Y ′)T.
By
Proposition 23.4.4 the joint distribution of (X, Y ) must then be the same as the
joint distribution of (X′, Y ′). Since according to the latter distribution the two
components are independent, it follows that the same must be true according to
the former, i.e., X and Y must be independent.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
one-dimensional Gaussian vector is a scalar N(0, 1) random variable. Conversely,
every N(0, 1) random variable can be viewed as a one-dimensional standard Gaus-
sian.
If W is a standard Gaussian random n-vector then, as we next show, its mean
vector and covariance matrix are given by
E[W] = 0,
and
KWW = In.
(23.37)
Indeed, the mean of a random vector is the vector of the means (23.22), so the
fact that E[W] = 0 is a consequence of all the components of W having zero
mean. And using (23.24) it can be easily shown that the covariance matrix of W
is the identity matrix because the components of W are independent and hence, a
fortiori uncorrelated, and because they are each of unit variance.
23.6
Gaussian Random Vectors
Recall Deﬁnition 23.1.1 that a random n-vector X is said to be Gaussian if for some
positive integer m there exists an n × m matrix A; a standard Gaussian random
m-vector W; and a deterministic vector μ ∈Rn such that
X
L= AW + μ.
(23.38)
From (23.38), from the second order properties of standard Gaussians (23.37),
and from the behavior of the mean vector and covariance matrix under linear
transformation (23.25a) & (23.27) we obtain

X
L= AW + μ and W standard

=⇒

E[X] = μ and KXX = AAT
.
(23.39)
Recall also that X is a centered Gaussian if X
L= AW for A and W as above.
Every standard Gaussian vector is a centered Gaussian because every standard
Gaussian n-vector W is equal to AW when A is the n × n identity matrix In.
The reverse is not true: not every centered Gaussian is a standard Gaussian.
Indeed, standard Gaussians have the identity covariance matrix (23.37), whereas
the centered Gaussian vector AW has, by (23.39), the covariance matrix AAT,
which need not be the identity matrix.
Also, X is a Gaussian vector if, and only if, X −E[X] is a centered Gaussian
because, by (23.39),


L= AW + μ for some μ ∈Rn and W standard Gaussian

(23.40)
From (23.40) it also follows that the centered Gaussians are the Gaussian vectors
of zero mean.8
8Thus, the name “centered Gaussian,” which we gave in Deﬁnition 23.1.1 was not misleading.
A vector is a “centered Gaussian” if, and only if, it is Gaussian and centered.

23.6 Gaussian Random Vectors

Using the deﬁnition of a centered Gaussian and using (23.39) we can readily show
that every positive semideﬁnite matrix is the covariance matrix of some centered
Gaussian. In fact, more is true:
Proposition 23.6.1 (Covariance Matrices and Positive Semideﬁnite Matrices).
The covariance matrix of every ﬁnite-variance random vector is positive semideﬁ-
nite, and every positive semideﬁnite matrix is the covariance matrix of some cen-
tered Gaussian random vector.
Proof. The covariance matrix of every random vector is positive semideﬁnite be-
cause every covariance matrix is symmetric (23.29) and satisﬁes (23.28). We next
establish the reverse. Given an n × n positive semideﬁnite matrix K we shall con-
struct a centered Gaussian X whose covariance matrix KXX is equal to K. We begin
by noting that, since K is positive semideﬁnite, it follows from Proposition 23.3.5
that there exists some n × n matrix S such that STS = K. Let W be a standard
Gaussian n-vector and consider the vector X = STW. Being the result of a linear
transformation of the standard Gaussian W, this vector is a centered Gaussian. We
complete the proof by showing that its covariance matrix KXX is the prespeciﬁed
matrix K. This follows from the calculation
KXX = STS
= K,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from (23.39) (by substituting ST for A and 0 for μ)
and the second from our choice of S as satisfying STS = K.

Examples and Basic Properties
In this section we provide some examples of Gaussian vectors and some simple
properties that follow from their deﬁnition.
(i) Every univariate N

μ, σ2
random variable, when viewed as a one dimen-
sional random vector, is a Gaussian random vector.
Proof:
Such a univariate random variable has the same law as
σW + μ, when W is a standard univariate Gaussian.
(ii) Any deterministic vector is a Gaussian vector.
Proof: Choose the matrix A as the all-zero matrix 0.
(iii) If the components of X are independent univariate Gaussians (not necessarily
of equal variance), then X is a Gaussian vector.
Proof: Choose A to be an appropriate diagonal matrix.
For the purposes of stating the next proposition we remind the reader that the ran-
dom vectors X =

Proposition 23.6.2 (Stacking Independent Gaussian Vectors). Stacking two in-
dependent Gaussian vectors on top of each other results in a Gaussian vector.
Proof. Let the random n1-vector X1 = (X(1)
1 , . . . , X(n1)
1
)T be Gaussian, and let the
random n2-vector X2 = (X(1)
2 , . . . , X(n2)

We need to show that the (n1 + n2)-vector

is Gaussian.
Let the n1 × m1 matrix A1 and the vector μ1 ∈Rn1 represent X1 in the sense that
X1
L= A1W1 + μ1,
(23.42)
whenever W1 is a standard Gaussian m1-vector. Likewise, let the n2 × m2 ma-
trix A2 and the vector μ2 ∈Rn2 represent X2 in the sense that
X2
L= A2W2 + μ2,
(23.43)
whenever W2 is a standard Gaussian m2-vector. Let W be a standard Gaussian
(m1 +m2)-vector and let W1 comprise its ﬁrst m1 components and W2 its last m2
components.
It follows from the deﬁnition of a standard Gaussian vector that
W1 and W2 are independent standard Gaussian vectors. Since they are standard,
both (23.42) and (23.43) hold. And since they are independent, so are their aﬃne
transformations, so
A1W1 + μ1 is independent of A2W2 + μ2.
(23.44)
We conclude the proof by showing that the vector (23.41) can be represented using
the (n1 +n2)×(m1 +m2) block-diagonal matrix A of diagonal components A1 and
A2, and using the vector μ ∈Rn1+n2 that results when the vector μ1 is stacked on
top of the vector μ2:

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnitions of A and μ (23.45) and of W1

equality in distribution can be argued as follows: The ﬁrst n1 components of the
vector on the RHS of (23.47) have the same joint law as the ﬁrst n1 components
of the vector on the RHS of (23.48) by (23.42), and likewise the last n2 componets
by (23.43). Additionally, in both vectors the ﬁrst n1 components and the last n2
components are independent: in the former vector this follows from (23.44) and in
the latter from the hypothesis that X1 and X2 are independent.
Proposition 23.6.3 (An Aﬃne Transformation of a Gaussian Is a Gaussian).
Let X be a Gaussian n-vector. If C is a ν × n matrix and if d ∈Rν, then the
random ν-vector CX + d is Gaussian.
Proof. If X
L= AW + μ, where A is a deterministic n × m matrix, W is a standard
Gaussian m-vector, and μ ∈Rn, then
CX + d
L= C(AW + μ) + d
= (CA)W + (Cμ + d),
(23.49)
which demonstrates that CX+d is Gaussian, because (CA) is a deterministic ν ×m
matrix, W is a standard Gaussian m-vector, and Cμ + d is a deterministic vector
in Rν.
This proposition has some important consequences. The ﬁrst is that if we permute
the components of a Gaussian vector then the resulting vector is also Gaussian.
This explains why we sometimes say of random variables that they are jointly Gaus-
sian without specifying an order. Indeed, by the following corollary, the Gaussianity
of (X, Y, Z)T is equivalent to the Gaussianity of (Y, X, Z)T, etc.
Corollary 23.6.4. Permuting the components of a Gaussian vector results in a
Gaussian vector.
Proof. Follows from Proposition 23.6.3 by choosing C to be the appropriate per-
mutation matrix, i.e., the matrix that results from permuting the columns of the
identity matrix. For example,
⎛

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
Corollary 23.6.5 (Subsets of Jointly Gaussians Are Jointly Gaussian). Construct-
ing a random p-vector from a Gaussian n-vector by picking p of its components
(allowing for repetition) yields a Gaussian vector.
Proof. Let X be a Gaussian n-vector. For any choice of j1, . . . , jp ∈{1, . . . , n},
we can express the random p-vector (X(j1), . . . , X(jp))T as CX, where C is a deter-
ministic p × n matrix whose Row-ν Column-ℓcomponent is given by
[C]ν,ℓ= I{ℓ= jν}.
For example

=
	
0
0

1

 ⎛
⎝
X(1)
X(2)
X(3)
⎞
⎠.
The result thus follows from Proposition 23.6.3.
Proposition 23.6.6. Each component of a Gaussian vector is a univariate Gaus-
sian.
Proof. Let X be a Gaussian n-vector, and let j ∈{1, . . . , n} be arbitrary. We
need to show that X(j) is Gaussian. Since X is Gaussian, there exist an n × m
matrix A, a vector μ ∈Rn, and a standard Gaussian W such that the vector X
has the same law as the random vector AW + μ (Deﬁnition 23.1.1). In particular,
the j-th component of X has the same law as the j-th component of AW + μ, i.e.,
X(j) L=
m

ℓ=1
a(j,ℓ)W (ℓ) + μ(j),
j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
The sum on the RHS is a linear combination of the independent univariate Gaus-
sians W (1), . . . , W (m) and is thus, by Proposition 19.7.3, Gaussian. The result of
adding μ(j) is still Gaussian.
We caution the reader that while each component of a Gaussian vector has a
univariate Gaussian distribution, there exist random vectors that are not Gaussian
and that yet have Gaussian components.
23.6.2
The Mean and Covariance Determine the Law of a Gaussian
From (23.39) it follows that if X
L= AW + μ, where W is a standard Gaussian,
then μ must be equal to E[X]. Thus, the mean of X fully determines the vector μ.
The matrix A, however, is not determined by the covariance of X. Indeed, by
(23.39), the covariance matrix KXX of X is equal to AAT, so KXX only determines
the product AAT.
Since there are many diﬀerent ways to express KXX as the
product of a matrix by its transpose, there are many choices of A (even of diﬀerent
dimensions) that result in AW + μ having the given covariance matrix. Prima
facie, one might think that these diﬀerent choices for A yield diﬀerent Gaussian
distributions. But this is not the case. In this section we shall show that, while the

.025

23.6 Gaussian Random Vectors
515
choice of A is not unique, all choices that result in AAT being equal to the given
covariance matrix KXX give rise to the same distribution.
We shall derive this result by computing the characteristic function ΦX(·) of a
random n-vector X whose law is equal to the law of AW + μ, where W, A, and μ
are as above and by then showing that ΦX(·) depends on A only via AAT, i.e.,
that ΦX(ϖ) can be computed for every ϖ ∈Rn from ϖ, AAT, and μ. Since, by
(23.39), AAT is equal to the covariance matrix KXX of X, it will follow that the
characteristic functions of all Gaussian vectors of a given mean vector and a given
covariance matrix are identical. Since random vectors of identical characteristic
functions must have identical distributions (Proposition 23.4.4), it will follow that
all Gaussian vectors of a given mean vector and a given covariance matrix have
identical distributions.
We thus proceed to compute the characteristic function of a random n-vector X
whose law is the law of AW + μ, where W is a standard Gaussian m-vector, A
is n × m, and μ ∈Rn. By (23.39) it follows that KXX = AAT. To that end we
need to compute E

eiϖTX
for every ϖ ∈Rn. From Proposition 23.6.3 (with the
substitution of the 1 × n matrix ϖT for C and of the scalar zero for d), it follows
that ϖTX is a Gaussian vector with only one component. By Proposition 23.6.6,
this sole component is a univariate Gaussian. Its mean is, by (23.25a), ϖTμ and
its variance is, by (23.30), ϖT KXX ϖ. Thus,
ϖTX ∼N

ϖTμ, ϖT KXX ϖ

,
ϖ ∈Rn.
(23.50)
Using the expression (19.29) for the characteristic function of the univariate Gaus-
sian distribution (with the substitution ϖTμ for μ, the substitution ϖT KXX ϖ
for σ2, and the substitution 1 for ϖ), we obtain that the characteristic func-
tion ΦX(·), which is deﬁned as E

eiϖTX
, is given by
ΦX(ϖ) = e−1
2 ϖT KXX ϖ+iϖTμ,
ϖ ∈Rn.
(23.51)
Since this characteristic function is fully determined by the mean vector and the
covariance matrix of X, it follows that the distribution is also determined by the
mean and covariance. We have thus proved:
Theorem 23.6.7 (The Mean and Covariance of a Gaussian Determine its Law).
Two Gaussian vectors of equal mean vectors and of equal covariance matrices have
identical distributions.
Note 23.6.8. Theorem 23.6.7 and Proposition 23.6.1 combine to prove that for
every μ ∈Rn and every n × n positive semideﬁnite matrix K there exists one, and
only one, Gaussian distribution of mean μ and covariance matrix K. We denote
this Gaussian distribution by N(μ, K).
By (23.51) it follows that if X ∼N(μ, K) then
ΦX(ϖ) = e−1
2 ϖTKϖ+iϖTμ,
ϖ ∈Rn.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
Theorem 23.6.7 has important consequences, one of which has to do with the
properties of independence and uncorrelatedness. Recall that any two independent
random variables (of ﬁnite mean) are also uncorrelated.
The reverse is not in
general true. But for jointly Gaussians it is: if X and Y are jointly Gaussian, then
X and Y are independent if, and only if, they are uncorrelated. More generally:
Corollary 23.6.9. Let X be a centered Gaussian (n1 + n2)-vector. Let the random
n1-vector X1 = (X(1), . . . , X(n1))T correspond to its ﬁrst n1 components, and let
X2 = (X(n1+1), . . . , X(n1+n2))T correspond to the rest of its components. Then the
vectors X1 and X2 are independent if, and only if, they are uncorrelated, i.e., if,
and only if,
E

X1XT
2

= 0.
(23.53)
Proof. The easy direction, which has nothing to do with Gaussianity, is that if
X1 and X2 are centered and independent, then (23.53) holds.
Indeed, by the
independence and the fact that the vectors are of zero mean we have
E

X1XT
2

= E[X1] E

XT
2

= E[X1] (E[X2])T
= 00T
= 0.
We now prove the reverse using the Gaussianity.
We begin by expressing the
covariance matrix of X in terms of the covariance matrices of X1 and X2 as
KXX =

where the second equality follows from (23.53).
Next, let X′
1 and X′
2 be independent random vectors such that X′
1
L= X1 and
X′
2
L= X2. Let X′ be the (n1 + n2)-vector that results from stacking X′
1 on top
of X′
2. Since X is Gaussian, it follows from Corollary 23.6.5 that X1 must also
be Gaussian, and since X′
1 has the same law as X1, it too is Gaussian. Similarly,
X′
2 is also Gaussian. And since X′
1 and X′
2 are, by construction, independent, it
follows from Proposition 23.6.2 that X′ is a centered Gaussian.
Having established that X′ is Gaussian, we next compute its covariance matrix.
Since, by construction, X′
1 and X′
2 are independent and centered,
KX′X′ =

23.6 Gaussian Random Vectors
517
Comparing (23.55) and (23.54) we conclude that X and X′ are centered Gaussians
of identical covariance matrices. Consequently, by Theorem 23.6.7, X′
L= X. And
since the ﬁrst n1 components of X′ are independent of its last n2 components, the
same must also be true for X.
Corollary 23.6.10. If the components of a Gaussian random vector are uncorrelated
and its covariance matrix therefore diagonal, then its components are independent.
Proof. Let X be a Gaussian random vector whose components are uncorrelated
and whose covariance matrix KXX therefore diagonal. Denote the diagonal ele-
ments of KXX by λ1, . . . , λn. Let μ be the mean vector of X. Another Gaussian
vector of this mean and of this covariance matrix is the Gaussian vector whose
components are independent N

μ(j), λj

. Since the mean and covariance deter-
mine the distribution of Gaussian vectors, it follows that the two vectors, in fact,
have identical laws so the components of X are also independent.
Another consequence of the fact that there is only one multivariate Gaussian distri-
bution of a given mean vector and of a given covariance matrix has to do with pair-
wise independence and independence. Recall that the random variables X1, . . . , Xn
are pairwise independent if for each pair of distinct indices ν′, ν′′ ∈{1, . . . , n}
the random variables Xν′ and Xν′′ are independent, i.e., if for all such ν′, ν′′ and
all ξν′, ξν′′ ∈R
Pr

Xν′ ≤ξν′, Xν′′ ≤ξν′′
= Pr

Xν′ ≤ξν′
Pr[Xν′′ ≤ξν′′].
(23.56)
The random variables X1, . . . , Xn are independent if for all ξ1, . . . , ξn in R
Pr

Xj ≤ξj, for all j ∈{1, . . . , n}

=
n
@
j=1
Pr

Xj ≤ξj

.
(23.57)
Independence implies pairwise independence, but the two are not equivalent. One
can ﬁnd triples of random variables that are pairwise independent but not inde-
pendent.9 But if X1, . . . , Xn are jointly Gaussian, then pairwise independence is
equivalent to independence:
Corollary 23.6.11. If the components of a Gaussian random vector are pairwise
independent, then they are independent.
Proof. If the components of a Gaussian vector are pairwise independent, then they
are uncorrelated and hence, by Corollary 23.6.10, independent.
Corollary 23.6.12. If W is a standard Gaussian n-vector, and if U is an n × n
orthogonal matrix, then UW is also a standard Gaussian vector.
9A classical example is the triple X, Y, Z where X and Y are IID each taking on the values
±1 equiprobably and where Z is their product.

518
The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
Proof. By Deﬁnition 23.1.1 it follows that the random vector UW is a centered
Gaussian. By (23.39) we obtain that the orthogonality of the matrix U implies
that the covariance matrix of this centered Gaussian is the identity matrix, which
is also the covariance matrix of W; see (23.37). Consequently, UW and W are
two centered Gaussian vectors of identical covariance matrices and hence, by The-
orem 23.6.7, of equal law. Since W is standard, this implies that UW must also
be standard.
The next corollary shows that if X is a centered Gaussian n-vector, then X
L= AW
for a standard Gaussian n-vector W and some square matrix A. That is, if the
law of an n-vector X is equal to the law of ˜A ˜
W where ˜A is an n × m matrix and
where ˜
W is a standard Gaussian m-vector, then the law of X is also identical to
the law of AW, where A is some n×n matrix and where W is a standard Gaussian
n-vector. Consequently, we could have required in Deﬁnition 23.1.1 that the matrix
A be square without changing the set of distributions that we deﬁne as Gaussian.
Corollary 23.6.13. If X is a centered Gaussian n-vector, then there exists a de-
terministic square n × n matrix A such that X
L= AW, where W is a standard
Gaussian n-vector.
Proof. Let KXX denote the covariance matrix of X. Being a covariance matrix,
KXX must be positive semideﬁnite (Proposition 23.6.1). Consequently, by Propo-
sition 23.3.5, there exists some n × n matrix S such that
KXX = STS.
(23.58)
Consider now the centered Gaussian STW, where W is a standard Gaussian n-
vector.
By (23.39), the covariance matrix of STW is STS, which by (23.58) is
equal to KXX. Thus X and STW are centered Gaussians of the same covariance,
and so they must be of the same law.
We have thus established that the law
of X is the same as the law of the product of a square matrix (ST) by a standard
Gaussian (W).
23.6.3
A Canonical Representation of a Centered Gaussian
The representation of a centered Gaussian vector as the result of the multiplication
of a deterministic matrix by a standard Gaussian vector is not unique. Indeed,
whenever the n × m matrix A satisﬁes AAT = K it follows that if W is a standard
Gaussian m-vector, then AW ∼N(0, K). (This follows because AW is a random
n-vector of covariance matrix AAT (23.39); it is, by Deﬁnition 23.1.1, a centered
Gaussian; and all centered Gaussians of a given covariance matrix have the same
law.) We saw in Corollary 23.6.13 that A can always be chosen as a square matrix.
Thus, to every K ⪰0 there exists a square matrix A such that AW ∼N(0, K). In
this section we shall focus on a particular choice of the matrix A that is useful in
the analysis of Gaussian vectors. In this representation A is a square matrix that
can be written as the product of an orthogonal matrix by a diagonal matrix. The
diagonal matrix acts on W by stretching and shrinking its components, and the
orthogonal matrix then rotates (and possibly reﬂects) the result.

Theorem 23.6.14 (A Canonical Representation of a Gaussian Vector). Let X be
a centered Gaussian n-vector of covariance matrix KXX. Then
X
L= UΛ1/2W,
where W is a standard Gaussian n-vector; the n × n matrix U is orthogonal; the
n × n matrix Λ is diagonal; the diagonal elements of Λ are the eigenvalues of KXX;
and the j-th column of U is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of KXX
that is equal to the j-th diagonal element of Λ.
Proof. By Proposition 23.6.1, KXX is positive semideﬁnite and a fortiori sym-
metric.
Consequently, by Proposition 23.3.5, there exists a diagonal matrix Λ
whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of KXX and there exists an orthogo-
nal matrix U such that KXX U = UΛ, so the j-th column of U is an eigenvector
corresponding to the eigenvalue given by the j-th diagonal element of Λ. Since
KXX ⪰0, it follows that all its eigenvalues are nonnegative, and we can deﬁne the
matrix Λ1/2 as the matrix whose components are the componentwise nonnegative
square roots of the matrix Λ. As in (23.21), choose S = Λ1/2UT. We then have
that KXX = STS. If W is a standard Gaussian, then STW is a centered Gaussian
of zero mean and covariance STS. Since STS = KXX and since there is only one
centered multivariate Gaussian distribution of a given covariance matrix, it follows
that the law of STW ( = UΛ1/2W) is the same as the law of X.
Corollary 23.6.15. A centered Gaussian vector can be expressed as the result of
an orthogonal transformation applied to a random vector whose components are
independent centered univariate Gaussians of diﬀerent variances. These variances
are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
Proof. Because the matrix Λ in the theorem is diagonal, we can write Λ1/2 W as
Λ1/2 W =
⎛
⎜
⎝
√λ1 W (1)
...
√λn W (n)
⎞
⎟
⎠,
where λ1, . . . , λn are the diagonal elements of Λ, i.e., the eigenvalues of KXX. Thus,
the random vector Λ1/2 W has independent components with the ν-th component
being N(0, λν).
Figures 23.1 and 23.2 demonstrate this canonical representation. They depict the

where W is a standard Gaussian vector with two components.
Theorem 23.6.14 can be used to ﬁnd a linear transformation that transforms a
given Gaussian vector to a standard Gaussian. The following is the multivariate
version of the univariate result showing that if X ∼N

μ, σ2
, where σ2 > 0, then
(X −μ)/σ has a N(0, 1) distribution (19.8).
Proposition 23.6.16 (From Gaussians to Standard Gaussians). Let the random
n-vector X be N(μ, K), where K ≻0 and μ ∈Rn. Let the n × n matrices Λ and U
be such that Λ is diagonal, U is orthogonal, and KU = UΛ. Then
Λ−1/2UT(X −μ) ∼N(0, In) ,
where Λ−1/2 is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the reciprocals of the
square roots of the diagonal elements of Λ.
Proof. Since an aﬃne transformation of a Gaussian vector is Gaussian (Proposi-
tion 23.6.3), it follows that Λ−1/2UT(X −μ) is a Gaussian vector. And since the
mean and covariance of a Gaussian vector fully specify its law (Theorem 23.6.7),
the result will follow once we show that the mean of Λ−1/2UT(X −μ) is the zero
vector and its covariance matrix is the identity matrix. This can be readily veriﬁed
using (23.27).

23.6.4
The Density of a Gaussian Vector
As we saw in Corollary 23.4.2, if the covariance matrix of a centered vector is
singular, then at least one of its components can be expressed as a deterministic
linear combination of its other components. Consequently, random vectors with
singular covariance matrices cannot have a density. If the covariance matrix is
nonsingular, then the vector may or may not have a density. If it is Gaussian, then
it does. In this section we shall derive the density of the multivariate Gaussian
distribution when the covariance matrix is nonsingular, i.e., when it is positive
deﬁnite
We begin with the centered case. To derive the density of a centered Gaussian
n-vector of positive deﬁnite covariance matrix K we shall use Theorem 23.6.14 to
represent the N(0, K) distribution as the distribution of UΛ1/2W where U is an
orthogonal matrix and Λ is a diagonal matrix satisfying KU = UΛ. Note that Λ
is nonsingular because its diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of K, which we
assume to be positive deﬁnite.
Let
B = UΛ1/2,
(23.59)
so the density we are after is the density of BW. Note that, by (23.59),
BBT = UΛ1/2Λ1/2UT

23.7 Jointly Gaussian Vectors
523
23.6.5
Linear Functionals of Gaussian Vectors
A linear functional on Rn is a linear mapping from Rn to R. For example, if α
is any ﬁxed vector in Rn, then the mapping
x 	→αTx
(23.63)
is a linear functional on Rn. In fact, as we next show, every linear functional on Rn
has this form. This can be proved by using linearity to verify that we can choose
the j-th component of α to equal the result of applying the linear functional to
the vector ej whose components are all zero except for its j-th component which
is equal to one.
If X is a Gaussian n-vector and if α ∈Rn, then, by Proposition 23.6.3 (applied
with the substitution of the 1×n matrix αT for C), it follows that αTX is a Gaus-
sian vector with only one component. By Proposition 23.6.6, this sole component
must have a univariate Gaussian distribution. We thus conclude that the result of
applying a linear functional to a Gaussian vector is a Gaussian random variable.
We next show that the reverse is also true: if X is of mean μ and of covariance
matrix K and if the result of applying every linear functional to X has a univari-
ate Gaussian distribution, then X ∼N(μ, K).10 To prove this result we compute
the characteristic function of X. For every ϖ ∈Rn the mapping x 	→ϖTx is
a linear functional on Rn. Consequently, our assumption that the result of the
application of every linear functional to X has a univariate Gaussian distribution
implies (23.50). From here we can follow the steps leading to (23.52) to conclude
that the characteristic function of X must be given by the RHS of (23.52). Since
this is also the characteristic function of a N(μ, K) random vector, it follows that
X ∼N(μ, K), because random vectors of identical characteristic functions must
have identical distributions (Proposition 23.4.4). We have thus proved:
Theorem 23.6.17 (Gaussian Vectors and Linear Functionals). A random vector X
is Gaussian if, and only if, every linear functional of X has a univariate Gaussian
distribution.
23.7
Jointly Gaussian Vectors
Three miracles occur when we compute the conditional distribution of X given
Y = y for jointly Gaussian random vectors X and Y. Before describing these
miracles we need to deﬁne jointly Gaussian vectors.
Deﬁnition 23.7.1 (Jointly Gaussian Vectors). Two random vectors are said to be
jointly Gaussian if the vector that results when one is stacked on top of the other
is Gaussian.
10It is not diﬃcult to show that the assumption that X is of ﬁnite variance is not necessary.
If every linear functional of X is of ﬁnite variance, then X must be of ﬁnite variance. Thus, we
could have stated the result as follows: if a random vector is such that the result of applying
every linear functional to it is a univariate Gaussian, then it is a multivariate Gaussian.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
That is, the random nx-vector X = (X(1), . . . , X(nx))T and the random ny-vector
Y = (Y (1), . . . , Y (ny))T are jointly Gaussian if the random (nx + ny)-vector

X(1), . . . , X(nx), Y (1), . . . , Y (ny)T
is Gaussian.
By Corollary 23.6.5, the random vectors X and Y can only be jointly Gaussian if
each is Gaussian. But this is not enough: both X and Y can be Gaussian without
them being jointly Gaussian.
However, if X and Y are independent Gaussian
vectors, then, by Proposition 23.6.2, they are jointly Gaussian.
Proposition 23.7.2. Independent Gaussian vectors are jointly Gaussian.
By Corollary 23.6.9 we have:
Proposition 23.7.3. If two jointly Gaussian random vectors are uncorrelated, then
they are independent.
Having deﬁned jointly Gaussian random vectors we next turn to the main result of
this section. Loosely speaking, it states that if X and Y are jointly Gaussian, then
in computing the conditional distribution of X given Y = y three miracles occur:
(i) the conditional distribution is a multivariate Gaussian;
(ii) its mean vector is an aﬃne function of y;
(iii) and its covariance matrix does not depend on y.
Before stating this more formally, we justify two simplifying assumptions. The ﬁrst
assumption is that the covariance matrix of Y is nonsingular, so
KYY ≻0.
The reason is that if the covariance matrix of Y is singular, then, by Corol-
lary 23.4.2, some of its components are with probability one aﬃne functions of
the others, and we then have to consider two cases. If the realization y satisﬁes
these aﬃne relations, then we can just pick a subset of the components of Y that
determine all the other components and that have a nonsingular covariance matrix
as in Section 23.4.3 and ignore the other components of y; the ignored components
do not alter the conditional distribution of X given Y = y. The other case where
the realization y does not satisfy the relations that Y satisﬁes with probability one
can be ignored because it occurs with probability zero.
The second assumption we make is that both X and Y are centered. There is no
loss in generality in making this assumption for the following reason. Conditioning
on Y = y when Y has mean μy is equivalent to conditioning on Y −μy = y −μy.
And if X has mean μx, then we can compute the conditional distribution of X by
computing the conditional distribution of X−μx and by then shifting the resulting
distribution by μx. Thus, the conditional density fX|Y=y(·) is given by
fX|Y=y(x) = fX−μx|Y−μy=y−μy(x −μx),

23.7 Jointly Gaussian Vectors

where X −μx & Y −μy are jointly Gaussian and centered whenever X & Y are
jointly Gaussian. It is now straightforward to verify that if the miracles hold for
the centered case
x 	→fX−μx|Y−μy=y−μy(x)
then they also hold for the general case
x 	→fX−μx|Y−μy=y−μy(x −μx).
Theorem 23.7.4. Let X and Y be centered and jointly Gaussian with covariance
matrices KXX and KYY. Assume that KYY ≻0. Then the conditional distribution
of X conditional on Y = y is a multivariate Gaussian of mean

Moreover, the deviation of X from its conditional mean is independent of Y:

YY Y is independent of Y.

Proof. Let nx and ny denote the number of components of X and Y. Let D be
any deterministic real nx × ny matrix. Then clearly
X = DY +

X −DY

(23.68)
Since X and Y are jointly Gaussian, the vector

quently, since

it follows from Proposition 23.6.3 that
(X −DY) and Y are centered and jointly Gaussian.
(23.69)
Suppose now that the matrix D is chosen so that (X−DY) and Y are uncorrelated:
E

(X −DY)YT
= 0.
(23.70)
By (23.69) and Proposition 23.7.3 it then follows that
(X −DY) is independent of Y.
(23.71)
Consequently, with this choice of D, the decomposition (23.68) expresses X as
the sum of two terms where the ﬁrst, DY, is fully determined by Y and where the
second, (X−DY), is independent of Y. It follows that the conditional distribution
of X given Y = y is the same as the distribution of (X−DY) but shifted by Dy. By
(23.69) and Corollary 23.6.5, (X −DY) is a centered Gaussian, so the conditional
distribution of X given Y = y is that of the centered Gaussian (X−DY) shifted by
the vector Dy. This already establishes the three “miracles” we discussed before:

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
the conditional distribution of X given Y = y is Gaussian; its mean Dy is a
linear function of Y; and its covariance matrix, which is the covariance matrix of
(X −DY), does not depend on the realization y of Y.
That the mean of the conditional distribution is as given in (23.65) and that the co-
variance matrix is as given in (23.66) now follow from straightforward calculations.
Indeed, by solving (23.70) for D we obtain
D = E

XYT
K−1
YY,
(23.72)
so Dy is given by (23.65). To show that the covariance of the conditional law of X

of (X −DY), which is given by

where the ﬁrst equality follows by opening the second set of parentheses; the second
by (23.3) and (23.25b); the third by (23.70); the fourth by opening the parentheses
and using the linearity of the expectation; and the ﬁnal equality by (23.72).
Finally, (23.67) follows from (23.71) and the explicit form of D (23.72).
Theorem 23.7.4 has important consequences in Estimation Theory. A key result
in Estimation Theory is that if after observing that Y = y for some y ∈Rny we
would like to estimate the random nx-vector X using a (Borel measurable) function
g: Rny →Rnx so as to minimize the estimation error

(23.73)
then an optimal choice for g(·) is the conditional expectation

y ∈Rny.
(23.74)
Theorem 23.7.4 demonstrates that if X and Y are jointly Gaussian and centered,
then E[X|Y = y] is a linear function of y and is explicitly given by (23.65). Thus,
for jointly Gaussian centered random vectors, there is no loss of optimality in
limiting ourselves to linear estimators.
The optimality of choosing g(·) as in (23.74) has a simple intuitive explanation. We
ﬁrst note that it suﬃces to establish the result when nx = 1, i.e., when estimating
a random variable rather than a random vector. Indeed, the squared-norm error in
estimating a random vector X with nx components is the sum of the squared errors
in estimating its components. To minimize the sum, one should therefore minimize
each of the terms. And the problem of estimating the j-th component of X based
on the observation Y = y is a problem of estimating a random variable. Stated

23.8 Moments and Wick’s Formula
527
diﬀerently, to estimate X so as to minimize the error (23.73) we should separately
estimate each of its components.
Having established that it suﬃces to prove the optimality of (23.74) when nx = 1,
we now assume that nx = 1 and denote the random variable to be estimated by X.
To study how to estimate X after observing that Y = y, we ﬁrst consider the
case where there is no observation. In this case, the estimate is a constant, and
by Lemma 14.4.1 the optimal choice of that constant is the mean E[X]. We now
view the general case where we observe Y = y as though there were no observables
but X had the a posteriori distribution given Y = y. Utilizing the result for the
case where there are no observables yields that estimating X by E[X |Y = y] is
optimal.
23.8
Moments and Wick’s Formula
We next describe without proof a technique for computing moments of centered
Gaussian vectors. A sketch of a proof can be found in (Zvonkin, 1997).
Theorem 23.8.1 (Wick’s Formula). Let X be a centered Gaussian n-vector and
let g1, . . . , g2k : Rn →R be an even number of (not necessarily diﬀerent) linear
functionals on Rn. Then

such that
p1 < p2 < · · · < pk
(23.76a)
and
p1 < q1,
p2 < q2,
. . . ,
pk < qk.
(23.76b)
The number of terms on the RHS of (23.75) is 1 × 3 × 5 × · · · × (2k −1).
Example 23.8.2. Suppose that n = 1, so X is a centered univariate Gaussian.
Let σ2 be its variance, and suppose we wish to compute E

X4
. We can express this
in the form of Theorem 23.8.1 with k = 2 and g1(x) = g2(x) = g3(x) = g4(x) = x.

The results of Section 19.9 on limits of Gaussian random variables extend to Gaus-
sian vectors.
In this setting we consider random vectors X, X1, X2, . . . deﬁned
over the probability space (Ω, F, P). We say that the sequence of random vectors
X1, X2, . . . converges to the random vector X with probability one or almost
surely if

23.10 Conditionally-Independent Gaussian Vectors
529
Theorem 23.9.1. Let the random d-vectors X, X1, X2, . . . be deﬁned over a com-
mon probability space. Let X1, X2, . . . each be Gaussian (with possibly diﬀerent
mean vectors and covariance matrices). If the sequence X1, X2, . . . converges to X
in the sense of (23.79) or (23.80) or (23.81), then X must be Gaussian.
Proof. The proof is based on Theorem 23.6.17, which demonstrates that it suﬃces
to consider linear functionals of the vectors in the sequence and on the analogous
result for scalars (Theorem 19.9.1). We demonstrate the idea by considering the
case where the convergence is almost sure. If X1, X2, . . . converges almost surely
to X, then for every α ∈Rd the sequence αTX1, αTX2, . . . converges almost surely
to αTX. Since, by Theorem 23.6.17, linear functionals of Gaussian vectors are
univariate Gaussians, it follows that the sequence αTX1, αTX2, . . . is a sequence of
Gaussian random variables. And since it converges almost surely to αTX, it follows
from Theorem 19.9.1 that αTX must be Gaussian. Since this is true for every α
in Rd, it follows from Theorem 23.6.17 that X must be a Gaussian vector.
In analogy to Theorem 19.9.3 we have the following result on weakly converging
Gaussian vectors.
Theorem 23.9.2 (Weakly Converging Gaussian Vectors). Let the sequence of
random d-vectors X1, X2, . . . be such that Xn ∼N(μn, Kn) for n = 1, 2, . . . Then
the sequence converges in distribution to some limiting distribution, if, and only if,
there exist some μ ∈Rd and some d × d matrix K such that
μn →μ and Kn →K.
(23.84)
And if the sequence does converge in distribution, then it converges to the multi-
variate Gaussian distribution of mean vector μ and covariance matrix K.
Proof. See (Gikhman and Skorokhod, 1996, Chapter I, Section 3, Theorem 4).
23.10
Conditionally-Independent Gaussian Vectors
Given the covariance matrix of a Gaussian vector X, it is easy to check whether two
of its components X(j) and X(ℓ) are independent: they are independent if, and only
if, the Row-j Column-ℓcomponent of the covariance matrix is zero. More generally,
the η1-vector (X(j1), . . . , X(jη1)) is independent of the η2-vector (X(ℓ1), . . . , X(ℓη2))
if, and only if, for every 1 ≤ν′ ≤η1 and 1 ≤ν′′ ≤η2 the Row-ν′ Column-ν′′
component of the covariance matrix is zero (Proposition 23.7.3).
Is there an easy check for conditional independence? It turns out that there is,
though not in terms of the covariance matrix but in terms of its inverse—the
precision matrix. Such a check is described in the next theorem, which is the
section’s main result.
Theorem 23.10.1 (Conditional Independence and the Precision Matrix). Let X
be a Gaussian n-vector of components X(1), . . . , X(n) and nonsingular covariance
matrix K. Let J , K, and L be disjoint sets whose union is the set {1, . . . , n}. Then
the following statements are equivalent.

Figure 23.3: The zeros of a precision matrix and the graph associated with it.
(a) The collections of random variables {X(j), j ∈J } and {X(k), k ∈K} are
conditionally independent given {X(ℓ), ℓ∈L}.
(b) For every j ∈J and k ∈K the Row-j Column-k entry of K−1 is zero.
This theorem shows that the conditional independencies among the components
of a Gaussian vector are determined by the locations of the zeros in the precision
matrix. These locations can be described using a graph that we associate with
the precision matrix and from which the conditional independencies are easily read
oﬀ. The graph is an undirected graph whose nodes are the elements of the set
{1, . . . , n} and where an edge connects Node j with Node k whenever j ̸= k and
the Row-j Column-k entry of K−1 is nonzero. See Figure 23.3 for an example of a
precision matrix and the graph associated with it. Statement (b) in the theorem is
equivalent to the condition that removing the nodes in L and all the edges touching
them results in a graph with no path connecting a node in J with a node in K. For
example, suppose that n = 5 and the zeros in K−1 and the associated graph are as
in Figure 23.3. In this case, X(5) and (X(1), X(3)) are conditionally independent
given (X(2), X(4)). Likewise, (X(2), X(5)) and X(3) are conditionally independent
given (X(1), X(4)).
Before proving the theorem, we ﬁrst argue that it suﬃces to prove it for the special
case where the elements of J , K, and L are consecutive:
J = {1, . . . , # J }, K = {# J + 1, . . . , # J + # K}, L = {n −# L + 1, . . . , n}.
To see why, let π(·) be a permutation on {1, . . . , n} that maps {1, . . . , # J } to J ;
that maps {# J + 1, . . . , # J + # K} to K; and that maps {n −# L + 1, . . . , n}
to L. Let ˜X be the random vector that results from permuting the components
of X
˜X(i) = X(π(i)),
i = 1, . . . , n.
(23.85)
Its covariance matrix ˜K is given (using the notation of Section 23.2) by
˜K

j,k =

K

π(j),π(k),
j, k ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(23.86)
And its precision matrix ˜K−1 is given by11
˜K−1
j,k =

K−1
π(j),π(k),
j, k ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(23.87)
11This is easily seen by deﬁning the permutation matrix P whose Row-i Column-j entry is
I{j = π(i)}; by noting that ˜X = PX; by using (23.27) to conclude that ˜K = PKPT; and by using
the inversion formula for a product of matrices and the fact that P is orthogonal.

23.10 Conditionally-Independent Gaussian Vectors
531
With these deﬁnition, Statement (a) in the theorem is equivalent to the statement
that the ﬁrst # J components of ˜X and the next # K components are conditionally
independent given the last # L components, and Statement (b) in the theorem is
equivalent to the statement that the Row-j Column-k entry of ˜K−1 is zero whenever
j ∈{1, . . . , # J } and k ∈{# J + 1, . . . , n −# L}. Proving the equivalence of the
statements about ˜X thus also proves the equivalence of the statements about X.
Before proceeding to prove the above special case, we formulate it as a proposition
using slightly diﬀerent language.
Proposition 23.10.2. Let the centered random vectors X ∈Rnx, Y ∈Rny, and
Z ∈Rnz be jointly Gaussian, and let the vector (XT, YT, ZT)T that results when
they are stacked on top of each other have a nonsingular covariance matrix K.
Represent its inverse using submatrices as
K−1 =
⎛
⎝
A
B

F
⎞
⎠,
(23.88)
where A ∈Rnx×nx, B ∈Rnx×ny, C ∈Rnx×nz, D ∈Rny×ny, E ∈Rny×nz, F ∈
Rnz×nz, and where A, D, and F are symmetric.12 Then X and Y are conditionally
independent given Z if, and only if, B is zero.
The signiﬁcance of B being zero can be understood in the following way. Recalling
the density of a centered Gaussian (Section 23.6.4),
fX,Y,Z(x, y, z) = α exp

det(K−1).
Using this and the representation (23.88), we obtain
ln fX,Y,Z(x, y, z) = ln α −1
2

xTAx + 2xTBy + 2xTCz + yTDy + 2yTEz + zTFz

.
(23.90)
We thus see that the logarithm of the Gaussian density function is always the sum
of a constant (ln α) and a quadratic form in x, y, and z. The matrix B in the
representation (23.88) is zero if, and only if, the quadratic form associated with
K−1 does not have any cross terms involving x and y.
Before we can prove Proposition 23.10.2 and thus conclude the proof of Theo-
rem 23.10.1, we need a factorization result on the joint probability density function
of conditionally independent random variables.
Suppose the random vectors X, Y, and Z have a joint probability density function.
Then X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if, and only if, X, Y, and Z
have a joint probability density function fX,Z,Y satisfying
fX,Y,Z(x, y, z) = fZ(z) fX|Z(x|z) fY|Z(y|z),
fZ(z) > 0.
(23.91)
12These matrices are symmetric because K is symmetric and hence so is its inverse.

The Multivariate Gaussian Distribution
Here fZ denotes the density of Z, and fX|Z and fY|Z denote conditional densities
(cf. Deﬁnition 20.11.2).
Clearly, if fX,Y,Z has the above form, then it can be written as the product of a
function of (x, z) and a function of (y, z). That is, fX,Y,Z factorizes as
fX,Y,Z(x, y, z) = g1(x, z) · g2(y, z).
(23.92)
Indeed, g1(x, z) can be chosen as fX,Z(x, z) and g2(y, z) as fY|Z(y|z). The next
proposition shows that the reverse is also true: a factorization of the form (23.92)
implies that X and Y are conditionally independent given Z.
Proposition 23.10.3 (Factorization and Conditional Independence). If X, Y, Z
are random vectors of joint density fX,Y,Z having the form (23.92), were g1(·, ·)
and g2(·, ·) are Borel measurable, then X and Y are conditionally independent
given Z.
Proof. Assume that fX,Y,Z has the form (23.92). Taking the absolute value of
both sides of (23.92), we conclude that if a factorization of the form (23.92) exists,
then it also exists with g1(·, ·) and g2(·, ·) nonnegative. Assume then that g1(·, ·)
and g2(·, ·) are nonnegative. (This will allow us later to use Fubini’s theorem to
change the orders of integration.)
The density of Z is obtained from the joint density by integrating over x and y
fZ(z) =

fX,Y,Z,(x, y, z) dx dy
=

g1(x, z) g2(y, z) dx dy,
(23.93)
and, for each z with fZ(z) > 0, the conditional density of X and Y given Z is
fX,Y|Z(x, y|z) = fX,Z,Y(x, z, y)
fZ(z)
= g1(x, z) g2(y, z)
fZ(z)
.
(23.94)
We conclude the proof by showing that the RHS of (23.94) is fX|Z(x|z) fY|Z(y|z).
For z with fZ(z) > 0,
fX|Z(x|z) fY|Z(y|z) = fX,Z(x, z)

where the last equality follows from (23.93). From (23.94) and (23.95) we conclude
that fX,Y,Z has the form (23.91).
We are now ready to prove Proposition 23.10.2 and to thus conclude the proof of
Theorem 23.10.1.
Proof of Proposition 23.10.2. We begin by proving that if B is zero, then X and
Y are conditionally independent given Z. Substituting 0 for B in (23.90) we obtain
ln fX,Y,Z(x, y, z) = ln α −1

2(yTDy + 2yTEz)

which implies the conditional independence of X and Y given Z (by Proposi-
tion 23.10.3).
To conclude the proof, we now assume that X and Y are conditionally independent
and prove that B must be zero. From the conditional independence and (23.91),
log fX,Y,Z(x, y, z) = log fX,Z(x, z) + log fY|Z(y|z).
(23.96)
The ﬁrst term on RHS, log fX,Z(x, z), is the logarithm of the joint density function
of X, Z and, as such, is a constant plus a quadratic form in (x, z). The second
term, log fY|Z(y|z) is the logarithm of the conditional density of Y given Z, which
is a noncentered Gaussian whose parameters are given in Theorem 23.7.4. Using its
explicit density, we conclude that log fY|Z(y|z) is a constant plus a quadratic form
in (y, z). Thus, log fX,Y,Z is the sum of a constant, a quadratic form in (x, z) and
a quadratic form in (y, z): it contains no cross terms involving x and y. Hence, B
must be zero.13

There are numerous books on Matrix Theory that discuss orthogonal matrices and
positive semideﬁnite matrices. We mention here (Zhang, 2011, Section 6.2), (Her-
stein, 1975, Chapter 6, Section 6.10), and (Axler, 2015, Chapter 7) on orthogonal
matrices, and (Zhang, 2011, Chapter 7), (Axler, 2015, Chapter 7), and (Horn and
Johnson, 2013, Chapter 7) on positive semideﬁnite matrices. Much more on the
multivariate Gaussian distribution can be found in (Tong, 1990), (Johnson and
Kotz, 1972, Chapter 35), and (Simon, 2002). For more on estimation and linear
estimation, see (Poor, 1994) and (Kailath, Sayed, and Hassibi, 2000). And for more
on quadratic forms see (Herstein, 1975, Section 6.11, pp. 350–354) and (Halmos,
1958).
13If you are worried because, technically speaking, the joint density function is not unique, do
not be: Two joint density functions of (X, Y, Z) can only diﬀer on a set of Lebesgue measure
zero. Consequently, if they are both continuous, then they must be identical.

Complex Gaussians and Circular Symmetry
24.1
Introduction
This chapter introduces the complex Gaussian distribution and the circular sym-
metry property. We start with the scalar case and then extend these notions to
random vectors. We rely heavily on Chapter 17 for the basic properties of complex
random variables and on Chapter 23 for the properties of the multivariate Gaussian
distribution.
24.2
Scalars
24.2.1
Standard Complex Gaussians
Deﬁnition 24.2.1 (Standard Complex Gaussian). A standard complex Gaus-
sian is a complex random variable whose real and imaginary parts are independent
N(0, 1/2) random variables.
If W is a standard complex Gaussian, then its density is given by
fW (w) = 1
π e−|w|2,
w ∈C,
(24.1)
because
fW (w) = fRe(W ),Im(W )

=

√π e−Re(w)2

√π e−Im(w)2
= 1
π e−|w|2,
w ∈C,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of the density fW (w) of a
CRV W at w ∈C as the joint density fRe(W ),Im(W ) of its real and imaginary
parts (Re(W), Im(W)) evaluated at

Re(w), Im(w)

(Section 17.3.1); the second
because the real and imaginary parts of a standard complex Gaussian are indepen-
dent; the third because the real and imaginary parts of a standard Gaussian are

zero-mean variance-1/2 real Gaussians whose density can thus be computed from
(19.6) (by substituting 1/2 for σ2); and where the ﬁnal equality follows because for
any complex number w we have Re(w)2 + Im(w)2 = |w|2.
Because the real and imaginary parts of a standard complex Gaussian W are of
zero mean, it follows that
E[W] = E[Re(W)] + i E[Im(W)]
= 0.
And because they are each of variance 1/2, it follows from (17.14c) that a standard
complex Gaussian W has unit-variance
Var[W] = E

|W|2
= 1.
(24.2)
Moreover, since a standard complex Gaussian is of zero mean and since its real
and imaginary parts are of equal variance and uncorrelated, a standard Gaussian
is proper (Deﬁnition 17.3.1 and Proposition 17.3.2), i.e.,
E[W] = 0
and
E

W 2
= 0.
(24.3)
Finally note that, by (24.1), the density fW (·) of a standard complex Gaussian
is radially-symmetric, i.e., its value at w ∈C depends on w only via its mod-
ulus |w|. A CRV whose density is radially-symmetric is said to be circularly-
symmetric, but the deﬁnition of circular symmetry applies also to complex ran-
dom variables that do not have a density. This is the topic of the next section.
24.2.2
Circular Symmetry
Deﬁnition 24.2.2 (Circularly-Symmetric CRV). A CRV Z is said to be circularly-
symmetric if for any deterministic φ ∈[−π, π) the distribution of eiφZ is identical
to the distribution of Z:
eiφZ
L= Z,
φ ∈[−π, π).
(24.4)
Note 24.2.3. If the expectation of a circularly-symmetric CRV is deﬁned, then it
must be zero.
Proof. Let Z be circularly-symmetric. It then follows from (24.4) that eiφZ and Z
are of equal expectation, so
E[Z] = E

eiφZ

= eiφ E[Z] ,
φ ∈[−π, π),
which, by considering a φ for which eiφ ̸= 1, implies that E[Z] must be zero.
To shed some light on the deﬁnition of circular symmetry we shall need Proposi-
tion 24.2.5 ahead, which is highly intuitive but a bit cumbersome to state. Before
stating it we provide its discrete counterpart, which is a bit easier to state: it
makes formal the intuition that if after giving the wheel-of-fortune an arbitrary

spin, you give it another fair spin, then the combined result is a fair spin that does
not depend on the initial spin. The case η = 2 is critical in cryptography. It shows
that taking the mod-2 sum of a binary source sequence with a sequence of IID
random bits results in a sequence that is independent of the source sequence.
Proposition 24.2.4. Fix a positive integer η, and deﬁne the set A = {0, . . . , η −1}.
Let N be a RV taking values in the set A.
Then the following statements are
equivalent:
(a) The RV N is uniformly distributed over the set A.
(b) For any integer-valued RV K that is independent of N, the RV (N+K) mod η
is independent of K and uniformly distributed over A.1
Proof. We ﬁrst show (b) ⇒(a). To this end, deﬁne K to be a RV that takes on
the value zero deterministically. Being deterministic, it is independent of every
RV, and in particular of N. Statement (b) thus guarantees that (N + 0) mod η is
uniformly distributed over A. Since we have assumed from the outset that N takes
values in A, it follows that (N +0) mod η = N, so the uniformity of (N +0) mod η
over A implies the uniformity of N over A.
We next show (a) ⇒(b). To this end, we need to show that if N is uniformly
distributed over A and if K is independent of N, then2

By the independence of N and K it follows that



(24.6)
This can be proved as follows. Because N is uniformly distributed over A, it follows
that N+k is uniformly distributed over the set {k, k+1, . . . , k+η−1}. And, because
the mapping m 	→(m mod η) is a one-to-one mapping from {k, k+1, . . . , k+η−1}
onto A, this implies that (N + k) mod η is also uniformly distributed over A, thus
establishing (24.6).
Proposition 24.2.5. Let Θ be a RV taking values in [−π, π). Then the following
statements are equivalent:
(a) The RV Θ is uniformly distributed over [−π, π).
1Here m mod η is the remainder of dividing m by η, i.e., the unique ν ∈A such that m −ν
is an integer multiple of η. E.g., 17 mod 8 = 1.
2Recall that the random variables X and Y are independent if, and only if, the conditional
distribution of X given Y is equal to the marginal distribution of X.

(b) For any real RV Φ that is independent of Θ, the RV (Θ + Φ) mod [−π, π) is
independent of Φ and uniformly distributed over the interval [−π, π).3
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 24.2.4 but with an added
twist. The twist is needed because if X has a uniform density and if a function g
is one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective), then g(X) need not be uniformly
distributed. (For example, if X ∼U ([0, 1]) and if g: [0, 1] →[0, 1] maps ξ to ξ2,
then g(X) is not uniform.)
To prove that (b) implies (a) we simply apply (b) to the deterministic RV Φ = 0.
We next prove that (a) implies (b). As in the discrete case, it suﬃces to show that
if Θ is uniformly distributed over [−π, π), then for any deterministic φ ∈R the
distribution of (Θ + φ) mod [−π, π) is uniform over [−π, π), irrespective of φ. To
this end we ﬁrst note that because Θ is uniform over [−π, π) it follows that Θ+φ is
uniform over [φ −π, φ + π). Consider now the mapping g: [φ −π, φ + π) →[−π, π)
deﬁned by g: ξ 	→

ξ mod [−π, π)

. This function is a one-to-one mapping onto
[−π, π) and is diﬀerentiable except at the point ξ∗∈[φ −π, φ + π) satisfying
ξ∗mod [−π, π) = π, i.e., the point ξ∗∈[φ−π, φ+π) of the form ξ∗= 2πm+π for
some integer m. At all other points its derivative is 1; see Figure 24.1. (Incidentally,
−π + φ is mapped to a negative number if φ < ξ∗and to a positive number if
φ > ξ∗. In Figure 24.1 we assume the latter.) Applying the formula for computing
the density of g(X) from the density of X (Theorem 17.3.4) we ﬁnd that if Θ + φ
is uniform over [φ −π, φ + π), then g(φ + Θ) is uniform over [−π, π).
With the aid of Proposition 24.2.5 we can now give alternative characterizations
of circular symmetry.

Complex Gaussians and Circular Symmetry
Proposition 24.2.6 (Characterizing Circular Symmetry). Let Z be a CRV with
a density. Then each of the following statements is equivalent to the statement
that Z is circularly-symmetric:
(a) The distribution of eiφZ is identical to the distribution of Z, for any deter-
ministic φ ∈[−π, π).
(b) The CRV Z has a radially-symmetric density function, i.e., a density fZ(·)
whose value at z depends on z only via its modulus |z|.
(c) The CRV Z can be written as Z = R eiΘ, where R ≥0 and Θ are independent
real random variables and Θ ∼U ([−π, π)).
Proof. Statement (a) is the deﬁnition of circular symmetry (Deﬁnition 24.2.2).
The proof of (a) ⇒(b) is slightly obtuse because the density of a CRV is not
unique.4
We begin by noting that if Z is of density fZ(·), then by (17.34) the
CRV eiφZ is of density w 	→fZ(e−iφw). Thus, if Z
L= eiφZ and if Z is of density
fZ(·), then Z is also of density w 	→fZ(e−iφw). Consequently, if Z is circularly-
symmetric, then for every φ ∈[−π, π) the mapping w 	→fZ(e−iφw) is a density
for Z. We can therefore conclude that the mapping
w 	→1
2π
 π
−π
fZ(e−iφw) dφ
is also a density for Z, and this function is radially-symmetric.
The fact that (b) ⇒(c) follows because if we deﬁne R to be the magnitude of Z
and Θ to be its argument, then Z = R eiΘ, and
fR,Θ(r, θ) = rfZ(r eiθ)
= rfZ(r)
=

2πrfZ(r)
 1
2π ,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from (17.29) and the second from our assumption
that fZ(z) depends on z only via its modulus |z|. The joint density of R, Θ is thus
of a product form, thereby indicating that R and Θ are independent. And it does
not depend on θ, thus indicating that its marginal Θ is uniformly distributed.
We ﬁnally show that (c) ⇒(a). To that end we assume that R ≥0 and Θ are
independent with Θ being uniformly distributed over [−π, π) and proceed to show
that R eiΘ is circularly-symmetric, i.e., that
R eiΘ L= R ei(Θ+φ),
φ ∈[−π, π).
(24.7)
To prove (24.7) we note that
ei(Θ+φ) = ei((Θ+φ) mod [−π,π))
L= eiΘ,
(24.8)
4And not all the functions that are densities for a given circularly-symmetric CRV Z are
radially-symmetric. The radial symmetry can be broken on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. We
can therefore only claim that there exists “a” radially-symmetric density function for Z.

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the periodicity of the complex exponentials,
and where the equality in distribution follows from Proposition 24.2.5 because
Θ ∼U ([−π, π)). The proof is now completed by noting that (24.7) follows from
(24.8) and from the independence of R and Θ. (If X is independent of Y , if X is
independent of Z, and if Y
L= Z, then (X, Y )
L= (X, Z) and hence XY
L= XZ.)
Example 24.2.7. Let the CRV Z be given by Z = eiΦ, where Φ ∼U ([−π, π)).
Then Z is uniformly distributed over the unit circle {z : |z| = 1} and is circularly-
symmetric. It does not have a density.
24.2.3
Properness and Circular Symmetry
Proposition 24.2.8. Every ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric CRV is proper.
Proof. Let Z be a ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric CRV. By Note 24.2.3 it
follows that E[Z] = 0. To conclude the proof it remains to show that E

Z2
= 0.
To this end we note that
E

,
φ ∈[−π, π),
(24.9)
where the ﬁrst equality follows by rewriting Z2 as e−i2φ 
eiφZ
2, and where the
second equality follows because the circular symmetry of Z guarantees that Z
and eiφZ have the same law, so the expectations of their squares must be equal.
But (24.9) cannot be satisﬁed for all φ ∈[−π, π) (or for that matter for any φ such
that ei2φ ̸= 1) unless E

Z2
= 0.
Note 24.2.9. Not every proper CRV is circularly-symmetric.
Proof. Consider the CRV Z that takes on the four values 1 + i, 1 −i, −1 + i, and
−1 −i equiprobably. Its real and imaginary parts are independent, each taking on
the values ±1 equiprobably. Computing E[Z] and E

Z2
we ﬁnd that they are both
zero, so Z is proper. To see that Z is not circularly-symmetric consider the random
variable eiπ/4Z. Its distribution is diﬀerent from the distribution of Z because Z
takes values in the set {1 + i, −1 + i, 1 −i, −1 −i}, and eiπ/4Z takes values in the
rotated set {
√
2, −
√
2,
√
2i, −

2i}.
The fact that not every proper CRV is circularly-symmetric is not surprising be-
cause whether a CRV is proper or not is determined solely by its mean and by the
covariance matrix of its real and imaginary parts, whereas circular symmetry has
to do with the entire distribution.

Complex Gaussians and Circular Symmetry
Deﬁnition 24.2.10 (Complex Gaussian). A complex Gaussian is a CRV whose
real and imaginary parts are jointly Gaussian real random variables. A centered
complex Gaussian is a complex Gaussian of zero mean.
An example of a complex Gaussian is the standard complex Gaussian, which we
encountered in Section 24.2.1.
The class of complex Gaussians is closed under multiplication by deterministic
complex numbers. Thus, if Z is a complex Gaussian and if α ∈C is deterministic,
then αZ is also a complex Gaussian. Indeed,
	Re(αZ)
Im(αZ)

=
	Re(α)
−Im(α)
Im(α)
Re(α)

 	Re(Z)
Im(Z)

,
so the claim follows from the fact that multiplying a real Gaussian vector by a
deterministic real matrix results in a real Gaussian vector (Proposition 23.6.3).
We leave it to the reader to verify that, more generally, if Z is a complex Gaussian
and if α, β ∈C are deterministic, then αZ +βZ∗is also a complex Gaussian. (This
is a special case of Proposition 24.3.9 ahead.)
Not every centered complex Gaussian can be expressed as the scaling of a standard
complex Gaussian by some complex number. But the following result characterizes
those that can:
Proposition 24.2.11.
(i) For every centered complex Gaussian Z we can ﬁnd coeﬃcients α, β ∈C so
that
Z
L= αW + βW ∗,
(24.10)
where W is a standard complex Gaussian.
(ii) A centered complex Gaussian Z is proper if, and only if, there exists some
α ∈C such that Z
L= αW, where W is a standard complex Gaussian.
Proof. We begin with Part (i). First note that since Z is a complex Gaussian, its
real and imaginary parts are jointly Gaussian, and it follows from Corollary 23.6.13
that there exist deterministic real numbers a(1,1), a(1,2), a(2,1), a(2,2) such that

and (24.10) is satisﬁed.
We next turn to Part (ii). One direction is straightforward: if Z
L= αW, then Z
must be proper because from (24.3) it follows that E[αW] = αE[W] = 0 and
E

(αW)2
= α2E

W 2
= 0.
We next prove the other direction that if Z is a proper complex Gaussian, then
Z
L= αW for some α ∈C and some standard complex Gaussian W. Let Z be a
proper complex Gaussian. By Part (i) it follows that there exist α, β ∈C such that
(24.10) is satisﬁed. Consequently, for this choice of α and β we have
0 = E

(αW + βW ∗)2

W 2

where the ﬁrst equality follows because Z is proper; the second because α and β
have been chosen so that (24.10) holds; the third by opening the brackets and using
the linearity of expectation; and the fourth by (24.3) and (24.2). It follows that
either α or β must be zero. Since W
L= W ∗, there is no loss in generality in assuming
that β = 0, thus establishing the existence of α ∈C such that Z
L= αW.
By Proposition 24.2.11 (ii) we conclude that if Z is a proper complex Gaussian, then
Z
L= αW for some α ∈C and some standard complex Gaussian W. Consequently,
the density of such a CRV Z (that is not deterministically zero) is given by

Complex Gaussians and Circular Symmetry
equality follows from (24.1). We thus conclude that if Z is a proper complex Gaus-
sian, then its density is radially-symmetric, and Z must be circularly-symmetric.
The reverse is also true: since every complex Gaussian is of ﬁnite variance, and since
every ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric CRV is also proper (Proposition 24.2.8),
we conclude that every circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian is proper. Thus:
Proposition 24.2.12. A complex Gaussian is circularly-symmetric if, and only if,
it is proper.
The picture that thus emerges is the following.
(i) Every ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric CRV is proper.
(ii) Some proper CRVs are not circularly symmetric.
(iii) A Gaussian CRV is circularly-symmetric, if and only if, it is proper.
We shall soon see that these observations extend to vectors too. In fact, the reader
is encouraged to consult Figure 24.2 on Page 554, which holds also for CRVs.

24.3.1
Standard Complex Gaussian Vectors
Deﬁnition 24.3.1 (Standard Complex Gaussian Vector). A standard complex
Gaussian vector is a complex random vector whose components are IID and each
of them is a standard complex Gaussian random variable.
If W is a standard complex Gaussian n-vector, then, by the independence of its n
components and by (24.1), its density is given by
fW(w) = 1
πn e−w†w,
w ∈Cn.
(24.14)
By the independence of its components and by (24.3)
E[W] = 0
and
E

WWT
= 0.
(24.15)
Thus, every standard complex Gaussian vector is proper (Section 17.4.2). By the
independence of the components and by (24.2) it also follows that
E

WW†

(24.16)
where we remind the reader that In denotes the n × n identity matrix.
24.3.2
Circularly-Symmetric Complex Random Vectors
Deﬁnition 24.3.2 (Circularly-Symmetric Complex Random Vectors). We say that
the complex random vector Z is circularly-symmetric if for every φ ∈[−π, π)
the law of eiφZ is identical to the law of Z.

An equivalent deﬁnition can be given in terms of linear functionals:
Proposition 24.3.3 (Circular Symmetry and Linear Functionals). Each of the fol-
lowing statements is equivalent to the statement that the complex random n-vector Z
is circularly-symmetric.
(a) For every φ ∈[−π, π) the law of the complex random vector eiφZ is the same
as the law of Z:
eiφZ
L= Z,
φ ∈[−π, π).
(24.17)
(b) For every deterministic vector α ∈Cn, the CRV αTZ is circularly-symmetric:
eiφαTZ
L= αTZ,

α ∈Cn, φ ∈[−π, π)

.
(24.18)
Proof. Statement (a) is just the deﬁnition of circular symmetry. We next show
that the two statements (a) and (b) are equivalent. We begin by proving that (a)
implies (b). This is the easy part because applying the same linear functional to
two random vectors that have the same law results in random variables that have
the same law. Consequently, (24.17) implies (24.18).
We now prove that (b) implies (a). We thus assume (24.18) and set out to prove
(24.17). By Theorem 17.4.4 it follows that to establish (24.17) it suﬃces to show
that the random vectors on the RHS and LHS of (24.17) have the same character-
istic function, i.e., that
E

ϖ† eiφZ

ϖ ∈Cn.
(24.19)
But this readily follows from (24.18) because upon substituting ϖ† for αT in
(24.18) we obtain that
ϖ† eiφZ
L= ϖ†Z,
ϖ ∈Cn,
and this implies (24.19), because if Z1
L= Z2, then E[g(Z1)] = E[g(Z2)] for any
measurable function g and, in particular, for the function g: ξ 	→ei Re(ξ).
The following proposition demonstrates that circular symmetry is preserved by
linear transformations.
Proposition 24.3.4 (Circular Symmetry and Linear Transformations). Let Z be a
circularly-symmetric complex random n-vector and let A be a deterministic complex
m×n matrix. Then the complex random m-vector AZ is also circularly-symmetric.
Proof. By Proposition 24.3.3 it follows that to establish that AZ is circularly-
symmetric it suﬃces to show that for every deterministic α ∈Cm the random
variable αTAZ is circularly-symmetric. To show this, ﬁx some arbitrary α ∈Cm.
Because Z is circularly-symmetric, it follows from Proposition 24.3.3 that for every
deterministic vector β ∈Cn, the random variable βTZ is circularly-symmetric.
Choosing β = ATα establishes that αTAZ is circularly-symmetric.

Complex Gaussians and Circular Symmetry
24.3.3
Proper vs. Circularly-Symmetric Vectors
We now extend the relationship between properness and circular symmetry to
vectors:
Proposition 24.3.5 (Circular Symmetry Implies Properness).
(i) Every ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric random vector is proper.
(ii) Some proper random vectors are not circularly-symmetric.
Proof. Part (ii) requires no proof because a CRV can be viewed as a complex
random vector taking values in C1, and we have already seen in Section 24.2.3 an
example of a CRV which is proper but not circularly-symmetric (Note 24.2.9).
We now prove Part (i). Let Z be a ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric random
n-vector. To establish that Z is proper we will show that for every α ∈Cn the
CRV αTZ is proper (Proposition 17.4.2). To this end, ﬁx an arbitrary α ∈Cn.
By Proposition 24.3.3 it follows that the CRV αTZ is circularly-symmetric. And
because Z is of ﬁnite variance, so is αTZ. Being a circularly-symmetric CRV of
ﬁnite variance, it follows from Section 24.2.3 that αTZ must be proper.

consisting of the real and imaginary parts of its components is a real Gaussian
vector. A centered complex Gaussian vector is a zero-mean complex Gaussian
vector.
Note that, Theorem 23.6.7 notwithstanding, the distribution of a centered complex
Gaussian vector is not uniquely speciﬁed by its covariance matrix. It is uniquely
speciﬁed by the covariance matrix if the Gaussian vector is additionally known to
be proper. This is a direct consequence of the following proposition.
Proposition 24.3.7. The distribution of a centered complex Gaussian vector Z is
uniquely speciﬁed by the matrices
K = E

ZZ†
and
L = E

ZZT
.
Proof. Let R be the real 2n-vector that results from stacking the real part of Z on
top of its imaginary part as in (24.20). We will prove the proposition by showing
that the matrices K and L uniquely specify the distribution of R.
Since Z is a complex Gaussian n-vector, R is a real Gaussian 2n-vector. Since Z is
of zero mean, so is R. Consequently, the distribution of R is fully characterized by
its covariance matrix E

(Theorem 23.6.7). The proof will thus be concluded

Corollary 24.3.8. The distribution of a proper complex Gaussian vector is uniquely
speciﬁed by its covariance matrix.
Proof. Follows from Proposition 24.3.7 by noting that by specifying that a complex
Gaussian is proper we are specifying that the matrix L is zero (Deﬁnition 17.4.1).
Proposition 24.3.9 (Linear Transformations of Complex Gaussians). If Z is a
complex Gaussian n-vector and if A and B are deterministic m × n complex ma-
trices, then the m-vector
AZ + BZ∗
is a complex Gaussian.
Proof. Deﬁne the complex random m-vector C ≜AZ + BZ∗. To prove that C is
Gaussian we recall that linearly transforming a real Gaussian vector yields a real
Gaussian vector (Proposition 23.6.3), and we note that the real random 2m-vector
whose components are the real and imaginary parts of C can be expressed as the
result of applying a linear transformation to the real Gaussian 2n-vector whose
components are the real and imaginary parts of the components of Z:

Proposition 24.3.10 (Characterizing Complex Gaussian Vectors). Each of the

n-vector.
(a) The real random vector whose 2n components correspond to the real and
imaginary parts of Z is a real Gaussian vector.

(b) For every deterministic vector α ∈Cn, the CRV αTZ is a complex Gaussian
random variable.
(c) There exist complex n × m matrices A and B and a vector μ ∈Cn such that
Z

for some standard complex Gaussian random m-vector W.
Proof. Statement (a) is just the deﬁnition of a Gaussian complex random vector.
We next prove the equivalence of (a) and (b). That (a) implies (b) follows from
Proposition 24.3.9 (by substituting αT for A and 0 for B).
To prove that (b) ⇒(a) it suﬃces (by Deﬁnition 24.3.6 and Theorem 23.6.17) to
show that (b) implies that any real linear functional of the real random 2n-vector
comprising the real and imaginary parts of Z is a real Gaussian random variable,
i.e., that for every choice of the real constants α(1), . . . , α(n) and β(1), . . . , β(n) the

where we deﬁne the real vectors α and β as α ≜(α(1), . . . , α(n))T ∈Rn and
β ≜(β(1), . . . , β(n))T ∈Rn.
Now (b) implies that (α −iβ)TZ is a Gaussian
complex random variable, so its real part Re((α −iβ)TZ) must be a real Gaus-
sian random variable (Deﬁnition 24.2.10 and Proposition 23.6.6), thus establishing
that (b) implies that (24.22) is a real Gaussian random variable.
We next turn to proving the equivalence of (a) and (c). That (c) implies (a) follows
directly from Proposition 24.3.9 applied to the Gaussian vector W. The proof of
the implication (a) ⇒(c) is very similar to the proof of its scalar version (24.10).
We ﬁrst note that since we can choose μ = E[Z], it suﬃces to prove the result for
the centered case. Now (a) implies that there exist n × n matrices D, E, F, G such

24.3.5
Proper Complex Gaussian Vectors
A proper complex Gaussian vector is a complex Gaussian vector that is also proper
(Deﬁnition 17.4.1). Thus, Z is a proper complex Gaussian vector if it is a centered
complex Gaussian vector satisfying E

ZZT
= 0.
Recall that, by Proposition 24.3.5, every ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric com-
plex random vector is also proper, but that some random vectors are proper and
not circularly-symmetric. We next show that for Gaussian vectors, circular sym-
metry is equivalent to properness. The relationship between circular symmetry,
properness, and Gaussianity is thus as illustrated in Figure 24.2.
Proposition 24.3.11 (For Complex Gaussians, Proper = Circularly-Symmetric).
A complex Gaussian vector is proper if, and only if, it is circularly-symmetric.
Proof. Every circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian is proper, because every com-
plex Gaussian is of ﬁnite variance, and every ﬁnite-variance circularly-symmetric
complex random vector is proper (Proposition 24.3.5).
We now turn to the reverse implication, i.e., that if a complex Gaussian vector
is proper, then it is circularly-symmetric. Assume that Z is a proper Gaussian
n-vector. We will prove that Z is circularly-symmetric using Proposition 24.3.3 by
showing that for every deterministic vector α ∈Cn the random variable αTZ is
circularly-symmetric.
To that end, ﬁx some arbitrary α ∈Cn. Since Z is a Gaussian vector, it follows that
αTZ is a Gaussian CRV (Proposition 24.3.9 with the substitution of αT for A and
0 for B). Moreover, since Z is proper, so is αTZ (Proposition 17.4.2). We have thus
established that αTZ is a proper Gaussian CRV and hence, by Proposition 24.2.12,
also circularly-symmetric.
We next address the existence of a proper complex Gaussian of a given covariance
matrix. We say that a complex n×n matrix K is complex positive semideﬁnite
and write K ⪰0 if α†Kα is a nonnegative real number for every α ∈Cn. The
covariance matrix KZZ (17.36) of every ﬁnite-variance complex random vector Z
is complex positive semideﬁnite, because α†Kα is the variance of α†Z and is, as
such, nonnegative. An n × n matrix K is complex positive semideﬁnite if, and only
if, there exists a complex n × n matrix S such that K = SS†; see (Axler, 2015,
Section 7.C, Theorem 7.35).

of all proper random vectors. The slanted lines indicate the circularly-symmetric
vectors, and the gray area corresponds to the Gaussian vectors. The same relations
hold for scalars and for stochastic processes.
Proposition 24.3.12 (Existence of Proper Gaussians). Given any n × n complex
positive semideﬁnite matrix K, there exists a proper complex Gaussian n-vector
whose covariance matrix is K.
Proof. Since K is positive semideﬁnite, it follows that there exists an n×n matrix S
such that
K = SS†.
(24.27)
Consider now the vector
Z = SW,
(24.28)
where W is a standard complex Gaussian n-vector. We will show that Z has the
desired properties. First, it must be Gaussian because it is the result of applying
a deterministic linear mapping to the Gaussian vector W (Proposition 24.3.9). It
is centered because W is centered (24.15) and because E[SW] = SE[W]. It is
proper because it is the result of linearly transforming the proper complex random
vector W (Proposition 17.4.3 and (24.15)). Finally, its covariance matrix is

Note 24.3.13. Since the distribution of a proper Gaussian complex vector is fully
speciﬁed by its covariance matrix (Corollary 24.3.8), we can denote the distribution
of a proper Gaussian complex vector of covariance matrix K by
NC(0, K) .
We next show that linearly transforming a proper Gaussian yields a proper Gaus-
sian.
Proposition 24.3.14 (Linearly Transforming Proper Gaussians). Multiplying a
proper complex Gaussian vector by a deterministic matrix yields another proper
complex Gaussian vector.
Proof. Let Z be a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian n-vector, and let A be
a deterministic m × n complex matrix. Then, being the result of linearly trans-
forming a complex Gaussian vector, AZ is a complex Gaussian m-vector (Propo-
sition 24.3.9). And since Z is proper, so is AZ (Proposition 17.4.3). Thus, AZ is
a proper complex Gaussian vector and hence also circularly-symmetric (Proposi-
tion 24.3.11).
The characteristic function of a proper Gaussian n-vector has a simple form:

To establish (24.29) we shall compute the characteristic function of a NC(0, K)
complex Gaussian n-vector and then invoke Theorem 17.4.4. But we begin with
the simpler computation of the characteristic function of a scalar standard complex
Gaussian W (Deﬁnition 24.2.1).

which establishes (24.29).
Like their real counterparts (Theorem 23.6.14) proper Gaussians have a natural
canonical representation:
Theorem 24.3.15 (Canonical Representation of Proper Complex Gaussian).
Let Z be a proper complex Gaussian n-vector of covariance matrix KZZ. Then
Z
L= UΛ1/2W,
where W is a standard complex Gaussian n-vector; the n × n matrix U is unitary;
the n × n matrix Λ is diagonal; the diagonal elements of Λ are the eigenvalues of
KZZ; and the j-th column of U is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of
KZZ that is equal to the j-th diagonal element of Λ.

Proof. Let Z ∼NC(0, K) be a complex n-vector, i.e., a circularly-symmetric com-
plex Gaussian n-vector of covariance matrix K. Being a covariance matrix, K must
be complex positive semideﬁnite. As such, it has a spectral representation analo-
gous to the one described for real matrices in Proposition 23.3.3:
K = UΛU†,
where U is a unitary n × n matrix (UU† = U†U = In), and Λ is an n × n diagonal
matrix whose diagonal elements λ1, . . . , λn are nonnegative.
Let W be a standard complex Gaussian n-vector. We next argue that
Z
L= UΛ1/2W,
where Λ1/2 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the square roots of
those of Λ, i.e., λ1/2
1
, . . . , λ1/2
n . To this end note that because W is standard, it
is proper (24.15). Consequently, UΛ1/2W must also be proper because applying
a linear transformation to a proper random vector yields a proper random vector
(Proposition 17.4.3). And UΛ1/2W is Gaussian by Proposition 24.3.9. Thus, both
Z and UΛ1/2W are circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian vectors. To establish
that they are of the same law it thus suﬃces to establish that they have iden-
tical covariance matrices (Corollary 24.3.8). This is indeed the case because the
covariance matrix of UΛ1/2W is given by

We conclude by computing the density of proper Gaussians. We only consider those
that have a nonsingular covariance matrix because otherwise the density does not
exist.

Chapter 25
Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
25.1
Notation
Recall from Section 12.2 that a continuous-time stochastic process

X(t), t ∈R

is a family of random variables that are deﬁned on a common probability space
(Ω, F, P) and that are indexed by the real line (time). We denote by X(t) the
time-t sample of

X(t), t ∈R

, i.e., the random variable to which t is mapped
(the RV indexed by t). This RV is sometimes also called the state at time t.
Rather than writing

X(t), t ∈R

, we sometimes denote the SP by

X(t)

or
by X. Perhaps the clearest way to denote the process is as a mapping:
X: Ω × R →R,
(ω, t) 	→X(ω, t).
For a ﬁxed t ∈R, the time-t sample X(t) is the mapping X(·, t) from Ω to the real
line, i.e., the RV ω 	→X(ω, t) indexed by t. If we ﬁx ω ∈Ω and view X(ω, ·) as a
mapping t 	→X(ω, t), then we obtain a function of time. This function is called a
trajectory, sample-path, path, sample-function, or realization.
ω 	→X(ω, t)
time-t sample for a ﬁxed t ∈R
(random variable)
t 	→X(ω, t)
trajectory for a ﬁxed ω ∈Ω
(function of time)
Recall also from Section 12.2 that the process is centered if for every t ∈R the
RV X(t) is of zero mean. It is of ﬁnite variance if for every t ∈R the RV X(t)
is of ﬁnite variance.
25.2
The Finite-Dimensional Distributions
The ﬁnite-dimensional distributions (FDDs) of a continuous-time SP

X(t)

are all
the joint distributions of n-tuples of the form (X(t1), . . . , X(tn)), where n can be
any positive integer and t1, . . . , tn ∈R are arbitrary epochs. To specify the FDDs
of a SP

X(t)

one must thus specify, for every n ∈N and for every choice of
the epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, the distribution of the n-tuple

X(t1), . . . , X(tn)

. This

25.2 The Finite-Dimensional Distributions
561
is a conceptually clear if formidable task. We denote the cumulative distribution
function of the n-tuple (X(t1), . . . , X(tn)) by
Fn

ξ1, . . . , ξn; t1, . . . , tn

≜Pr

X(t1) ≤ξ1, . . . , X(tn) ≤ξn

.
We next show that the FDDs of every SP

X(t)

must satisfy two key properties:
the symmetry property and the consistency property. The symmetry property
is that Fn(·; ·) is unaltered when we simultaneously permute its right arguments
(the t’s) and its left arguments (the ξ’s) by the same permutation. That is, for
every n ∈N; every choice of the epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R; every ξ1, . . . , ξn ∈R; and
every permutation π on {1, . . . , n}
Fn

ξπ(1), . . . , ξπ(n); tπ(1), . . . , tπ(n)

= Fn

ξ1, . . . , ξn; t1, . . . , tn

.
(25.1)
This property is a generalization to n-tuples of the obvious fact that if X and Y are
random variables, then Pr[X ≤x, Y ≤y] = Pr[Y ≤y, X ≤x] for every x, y ∈R.
The consistency property is that whenever n ∈N and t1, . . . , tn, ξ1, . . . , ξn ∈R,
lim
ξn→∞Fn

ξ1, . . . , ξn−1, ξn; t1, . . . , tn−1, tn

= Fn−1

ξ1, . . . , ξn−1; t1, . . . , tn−1

.
(25.2)
This property is a consequence of the fact that the set

ω ∈Ω : X(ω, t1) ≤ξ1, . . . , X(ω, tn−1) ≤ξn−1, X(ω, tn) ≤ξn

is increasing in ξn and converges as ξn tends to inﬁnity to the set

ω ∈Ω : X(ω, t1) ≤ξ1, . . . , X(ω, tn−1) ≤ξn−1

.
The key result on the existence of stochastic processes of given FDDs is Kol-
mogorov’s Existence Theorem, which states that the symmetry and consistency
properties suﬃce for a family of ﬁnite-dimensional distributions to correspond to
the FDDs of some SP.
Theorem 25.2.1 (Kolmogorov’s Existence Theorem). Let G1(·; ·), G2(·; ·), . . . be
a sequence of functions Gn : Rn × Rn →[0, 1] satisfying the following properties:
1) For every n ≥1 and every t1, . . . , tn ∈R, the function Gn(·; t1, . . . , tn) is a
valid joint distribution function.1
2) The symmetry property
Gn

ξπ(1), . . . , ξπ(n); tπ(1), . . . , tπ(n)

ξ1, . . . , ξn; t1, . . . , tn

,
t1, . . . , tn, ξ1, . . . , ξn ∈R, π a permutation on {1, . . . , n}.
(25.3)
1 A function F : Rn →[0, 1] is a valid joint distribution function if there exist random variables
X1, . . . , Xn whose joint distribution function is F(·), i.e.,
Pr[X1 ≤ξ1, . . . , Xn ≤ξn] = F(ξ1, . . . , ξn),
ξ1, . . . , ξn ∈R.
Not every function F : Rn →[0, 1] is a valid joint distribution function. For example, a valid joint
distribution function must be monotonic in each variable. See, for example, (Billingsley, 1995,
Theorem 12.5) for a characterization of joint distribution functions.

Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
3) The consistency property
lim
ξn→∞Gn(ξ1, . . . , ξn−1, ξn; t1, . . . , tn−1, tn)
= Gn−1(ξ1, . . . , ξn−1; t1, . . . , tn−1),
t1, . . . , tn, ξ1, . . . , ξn−1 ∈R.
(25.4)
Then there exists a SP

X(t)

whose FDDs are given by {Gn(·; ·)} in the sense
that
Pr

X(t1) ≤ξ1, . . . , X(tn) ≤ξn

= Gn

ξ1, . . . , ξn; t1, . . . , tn

for every n ∈N, all t1, . . . , tn ∈R, and all ξ1, . . . , ξn ∈R.
Proof. See, for example, (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 7, Section 36), (Cram´er and
Leadbetter, 2004, Section 3.3), (Grimmett and Stirzaker, 2001, Section 8.6), or
(Doob, 1990, Chapter I § 5).
In the study of n-tuples of random variables we can use the joint distribution
function to answer, at least in principle, most of our probability questions. When it
comes to stochastic processes, however, there are interesting questions that cannot
be answered using the FDDs. For example, it can be shown that the probability
of the event that the SP

X(t)

produces a sample-path that is continuous at time
zero cannot be computed from the FDDs. This is not due to our limited analytic
capabilities but rather because there exist two stochastic processes of identical
FDDs where for one process this event is of zero probability whereas for the other
it is of probability one (Cram´er and Leadbetter, 2004, Section 3.6). Fortunately,
most of the questions of interest to us in Digital Communications can be answered
based on the FDDs.
Another example is a very subtle question related to measurability. From the FDDs
alone one cannot determine whether the trajectories are measurable functions of
time, i.e., whether it makes sense to talk about integrals of the form
 ∞
−∞x(ω, t) dt.
This issue will be revisited in Section 25.9.
The above discussion motivates us to deﬁne the set of events whose probability
can be determined from the FDDs using the axioms of probability, i.e., using the
rules that the probability of the set of all possible outcomes Ω is one and that
the probability of a countable union of disjoint events is the inﬁnite sum of the
probabilities of the events. In the mathematical literature what we are deﬁning is
called the σ-algebra generated by

X(t), t ∈R

or the σ-algebra generated
by the cylindrical sets of

X(t), t ∈R

.2 For the classical deﬁnition see, for
example, (Billingsley, 1995, Section 36).
Deﬁnition 25.2.2 (σ-Algebra Generated by a SP). The σ-algebra generated
by a SP

X(t), t ∈R

which is deﬁned over the probability space (Ω, F, P) is
the set of events (i.e., elements of F) whose probability can be computed from the
FDDs of

X(t)

using only the axioms of probability.
2It is the smallest σ-algebra with respect to which all the random variables

X(t), t ∈R

are
measurable.

25.3 Deﬁnition of a Gaussian SP
563
We now rephrase our previous statement about continuity as saying that the set
of ω ∈Ω for which the function t 	→X(ω, t) is continuous at t = 0 is not in the
σ-algebra generated by

X(t)

. The probability of such sets cannot be inferred
from the FDDs alone. If such sets are assigned a probability, it must be based on
some additional information that is not captured by the FDDs.
The FDDs provide a natural way to deﬁne independence between stochastic pro-
cesses.
Deﬁnition 25.2.3 (Independent Stochastic Processes). Two stochastic processes

X(t)

and

Y (t)

, deﬁned on the same probability space (Ω, F, P), are said to
be independent stochastic processes if for every n ∈N and any choice of the
epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, the n-tuples (X(t1), . . . , X(tn)) and (Y (t1), . . . , Y (tn)) are
independent.
25.3
Deﬁnition of a Gaussian SP
By far the most important processes for modeling noise in Digital Communications
are the Gaussian processes. Fortunately, these processes are among the mathemat-
ically most tractable. The deﬁnition of a Gaussian SP builds on that of a Gaussian
vector (Deﬁnition 23.1.1).
Deﬁnition 25.3.1 (Gaussian Stochastic Processes). A SP

X(t)

is said to be a
Gaussian stochastic process if, for every n ∈N and every choice of the epochs
t1, . . . , tn ∈R, the random vector (X(t1), . . . , X(tn))T is Gaussian.
Note 25.3.2. Gaussian stochastic processes are of ﬁnite variance.
Proof. If

X(t)

is a Gaussian process, then a fortiori at each epoch t ∈R, the
random variable X(t) is a univariate Gaussian (choose n = 1 in the above deﬁni-
tion) and hence, by the deﬁnition of the univariate distribution (Deﬁnition 19.3.1),
of ﬁnite variance.
One of the things that make Gaussian processes tractable is the ease with which
their FDDs can be speciﬁed.
Proposition 25.3.3 (The FDDs of a Gaussian SP). If

X(t)

is a centered Gaus-
sian SP, then all its FDDs are determined by the mapping that speciﬁes the covari-
ance between any two of its samples:
(t1, t2) 	→Cov

X(t1), X(t2)

,
t1, t2 ∈R.
(25.5)
Proof. Let

X(t)

be a centered Gaussian SP. We shall show that, for any choice of
the epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, we can compute the joint distribution of X(t1), . . . X(tn)
from the mapping (25.5). To this end we note that since

X(t)

is a Gaussian
SP, the random vector (X(t1), . . . X(tn))T is Gaussian (Deﬁnition 25.3.1). Conse-
quently, its distribution is fully speciﬁed by its mean vector and covariance matrix
(Theorem 23.6.7). Its mean vector is zero, because we assumed that

X(t)

is cen-
tered. To conclude the proof we thus only need to show that the covariance matrix
.027

564
Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
of (X(t1), . . . X(tn))T is determined by the mapping (25.5). But this is obvious
because the covariance matrix of (X(t1), . . . X(tn))T is the n × n matrix

(25.6)
and each of the entries in this matrix is speciﬁed by the mapping (25.5).
Things become even simpler if the Gaussian process is wide-sense stationary
(Deﬁnition 25.4.2 ahead). In this case the RHS of (25.5) is determined by t1 −t2,
so the mapping (25.5) (and hence all the FDDs) is determined by the mapping
τ 	→Cov[X(t), X(t + τ)]. But before discussing wide-sense stationary Gaussian
stochastic processes in Section 25.5, we ﬁrst deﬁne stationarity and wide-sense
stationarity for general processes that are not necessarily Gaussian.
25.4
Stationary Continuous-Time Processes
With an eye to deﬁning stationarity for continuous-time stochastic processes, we
deﬁne the time shift by τ of a SP X: (ω, t) 	→X(ω, t) as the SP
(ω, t) 	→X(ω, t −τ).
(25.7)
A SP is stationary if its time shifts all have the same FDDs. More formally, we
have the following continuous-time analogue of Deﬁnition 13.2.1:
Deﬁnition 25.4.1 (Stationary Continuous-Time SP). We say that a continuous-
time SP

X(t)

is stationary (or strict sense stationary, or strongly sta-
tionary) if for every n ∈N, any epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, and every τ ∈R,

X(t1 + τ), . . . , X(tn + τ)
 L=

X(t1), . . . , X(tn)

.
(25.8)
By considering the case where n = 1 we obtain that if

X(t)

is stationary, then
all its samples have the same distribution
X(t)
L= X(t + τ),
t, τ ∈R.
(25.9)
That is, the distribution of the random variable X(t) does not depend on t. By
considering n = 2 we obtain that if

X(t)

is stationary, then the joint distribution
of any two of its samples depends on how far apart they are and not on the absolute
time at which they are taken

X(t1), X(t2)
 L=

X(t1 + τ), X(t2 + τ)

,
t1, t2, τ ∈R.
(25.10)
That is, the joint distribution of

X(t1), X(t2)

can be computed from t2 −t1.
As we did for discrete-time processes (Deﬁnition 13.3.1), we can also deﬁne wide-
sense stationarity of continuous-time processes. Recall that a process

X(t)

is
said to be of ﬁnite variance if at every time t ∈R the random variable X(t) is of
ﬁnite variance.

25.4 Stationary Continuous-Time Processes
565
Deﬁnition 25.4.2 (Wide-Sense Stationary Continuous-Time SP). A continuous-
time SP

X(t)

is said to be wide-sense stationary (or weakly stationary or
second-order stationary) if the following three conditions are met:
1) It is of ﬁnite variance.
2) Its mean is constant
E

X(t)

= E

X(t + τ)

,
t, τ ∈R.
(25.11)
3) The covariance between its samples satisﬁes
Cov

X(t1), X(t2)

= Cov

X(t1 + τ), X(t2 + τ)

,
t1, t2, τ ∈R.
(25.12)
By considering the case where t1 = t2 in (25.12), we obtain that all the samples of
a WSS SP have the same variance:
Var

X(t)

= Var

X(0)

,
t ∈R.
(25.13)
Note 25.4.3. Every ﬁnite-variance stationary SP is WSS.
Proof. This follows because (25.9) implies (25.11), and because (25.10) implies
(25.12).
The reverse is not true: some WSS processes are not stationary.
(Wide-sense
stationarity concerns only means and covariances, whereas stationarity has to do
with distributions.)
The following deﬁnition of the autocovariance function of a continuous-time WSS
SP is the analogue of Deﬁnition 13.5.1.
Deﬁnition 25.4.4 (Autocovariance Function). The autocovariance function
KXX : R →R of a WSS continuous-time SP

X(t)

is deﬁned for every τ ∈R by
KXX(τ) ≜Cov

X(t + τ), X(t)

,
(25.14)
where the RHS does not depend on t because

X(t)

is assumed to be WSS.
By evaluating (25.14) at τ = 0 and using (25.13), we can express the variance
of X(t) in terms of the autocovariance function KXX as
Var

X(t)

= KXX(0),
t ∈R.
(25.15)
We end this section with a few simple inequalities related to WSS stochastic pro-
cesses and their autocovariance functions.
Lemma 25.4.5. Let

X(t)

Stationary Gaussian Stochastic Processes
For Gaussian stochastic processes we do not distinguish between stationarity and
wide-sense stationarity. The reason is that, while for general processes the two
concepts are diﬀerent (in that every ﬁnite-variance stationary SP is WSS, but not
every WSS SP is stationary), for Gaussian stochastic processes the two concepts are
equivalent. These relationships between stationarity and wide-sense stationarity for
general stochastic processes and for Gaussian stochastic processes are illustrated
in Figure 25.1.
Proposition 25.5.1 (Stationary Gaussian Stochastic Processes).
(i) A Gaussian SP is stationary if, and only if, it is WSS.
(ii) The FDDs of a centered stationary Gaussian SP are fully speciﬁed by its
autocovariance function.
Proof. We begin by proving (i). One direction has only little to do with Gaus-
sianity. Since every Gaussian SP is of ﬁnite variance (Note 25.3.2), and since every

Figure 25.1: The relationship between wide-sense stationarity, Gaussianity, and
strict-sense stationarity. The outer region corresponds to all stochastic processes.
Within it is the set of all ﬁnite-variance processes and within that the set of all wide-
sense stationary processes. The slanted lines indicate the strict-sense stationary
processes, and the gray area corresponds to the Gaussian stochastic processes. Not
all strict-sense stationary SPs are WSS, but those of ﬁnite variance are.
ﬁnite-variance stationary SP is WSS (Note 25.4.3), it follows that every stationary
Gaussian SP is WSS.
Gaussianity plays a much more important role in the proof of the reverse direction,
namely, that every WSS Gaussian SP is stationary. We prove this by showing that
if

X(t)

is Gaussian and WSS, then for every n ∈N and any t1, . . . , tn, τ ∈R
the joint distribution of X(t1), . . . , X(tn) is identical to the joint distribution of
X(t1 + τ), . . . , X(tn + τ). To this end, let n ∈N and t1, . . . , tn, τ ∈R be ﬁxed.
Because

X(t)

is Gaussian, (X(t1), . . . , X(tn))T and (X(t1 + τ), . . . , X(tn + τ))T
are both Gaussian vectors (Deﬁnition 25.3.1). And since

X(t)

is WSS, the two
are of the same mean vector (see (25.11)). The former’s covariance matrix is

Since

X(t)

is WSS, the two covariance matrices are identical (see (25.12)). But
two Gaussian vectors of equal mean vectors and of equal covariance matrices have
identical distributions (Theorem 23.6.7), so the distribution of (X(t1), . . . , X(tn))T
is identical to that of (X(t1+τ), . . . , X(tn+τ))T. Since this has been established for
all choices of n ∈N and all choices of t1, . . . , tn, τ ∈R, the SP

X(t)

is stationary.
Part (ii) follows from Proposition 25.3.3 and the deﬁnition of wide-sense stationar-
ity. Indeed, by Proposition 25.3.3, all the FDDs of a centered Gaussian SP

X(t)

are determined by the mapping (25.5). If

X(t)

is additionally WSS, then the
RHS of (25.5) can be computed from t1 −t2 and is given by KXX(t1 −t2), so the
mapping (25.5) is fully speciﬁed by the autocovariance function KXX.
25.6
Properties of the Autocovariance Function
Many of the deﬁnitions and results on continuous-time WSS stochastic processes
have analogous discrete-time counterparts. But some technical issues are encoun-
tered only in continuous time. For example, most results on continuous-time WSS
stochastic processes require that the autocovariance function of the process be
continuous at the origin, i.e., satisfy
lim
δ→0 KXX(δ) = KXX(0),
(25.19)
and this condition has no discrete-time counterpart. As we next show, this condi-
tion is equivalent to the condition
lim

X(t + δ) −X(t)

where the ﬁrst equality follows by opening the square; the second by the linearity of
expectation; the third by the deﬁnition of KXX; and the ﬁnal equality by collecting
terms.
We note here that if the autocovariance function of a WSS process is continuous
at the origin, then it is continuous everywhere. In fact, it is uniformly continuous:
Lemma 25.6.1. If the autocovariance function of a WSS continuous-time SP is
continuous at the origin, then it is a uniformly continuous function.

where the equality in the ﬁrst line follows from the deﬁnition of the autocovariance

is centered; the equality in the second line by the linearity

between two zero-mean random variables; the inequality in the fourth line by the
Covariance Inequality (Corollary 3.5.2); the equality in the ﬁfth line by (25.21);
and the ﬁnal equality by trivial algebra.
The uniform continuity of KXX now
follows from (25.22) by noting that its RHS does not depend on τ and that, by our
assumption about the continuity of KXX at zero, it tends to zero as δ →0.
We next derive two important properties of autocovariance functions and then
demonstrate in Theorem 25.6.2 that these properties characterize those functions
that can arise as the autocovariance functions of a WSS SP. These properties are
the continuous-time analogues of (13.12) & (13.13), and the proofs are almost
identical. We ﬁrst state the properties and then proceed to prove them.
The ﬁrst property is that the autocovariance function KXX of any continuous-time
WSS process

is a symmetric function
KXX(−τ) = KXX(τ),
τ ∈R.

The next theorem demonstrates that Properties (25.23) and (25.24) characterize
the autocovariance functions of WSS stochastic processes (cf. Theorem 13.5.2).
Theorem 25.6.2. Every symmetric positive deﬁnite function is the autocovariance
function of some stationary Gaussian SP.
Proof. The proof is based on Kolmogorov’s Existence Theorem (Theorem 25.2.1)
and is only sketched here. Let K(·) be a symmetric and positive deﬁnite function
from R to R. The idea is to consider, for every n ∈N and for every choice of the
epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, the joint distribution function Gn(·; t1, . . . , tn) corresponding
to the centered multivariate Gaussian distribution of covariance matrix

25.7
The Power Spectral Density of a Continuous-Time SP
Under suitable conditions, engineers usually deﬁne the power spectral density of a
WSS SP as the Fourier Transform of its autocovariance function. There is nothing
wrong with this deﬁnition, and we encourage the reader to think about the PSD
in this way.4 We, however, prefer a slightly more general deﬁnition that allows us
also to consider discontinuous spectra and, more importantly, allows us to infer
that any integrable, nonnegative, symmetric function is the PSD of some Gaus-
sian SP (Proposition 25.7.3). Fortunately, the two deﬁnitions agree whenever the
autocovariance function is continuous and integrable.
Before deﬁning the PSD, we pause to discuss the Fourier Transform of the auto-
covariance function. If the autocovariance function KXX of a WSS SP

X(t)

is
integrable, i.e., if
 ∞
−∞
KXX(τ)
 dτ < ∞,
(25.26)
then we can discuss its FT ˆKXX. The following proposition summarizes the main
properties of the FT of continuous integrable autocovariance functions.
Proposition 25.7.1. If the autocovariance function KXX is continuous at the origin
and integrable, then its Fourier Transform ˆKXX is nonnegative
ˆKXX(f) ≥0,
f ∈R
(25.27)
and symmetric
ˆKXX(−f) = ˆKXX(f),
f ∈R.
(25.28)
Moreover, the Inverse Fourier Transform recovers KXX in the sense that5
KXX(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
ˆKXX(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R.
(25.29)
Proof. This result can be deduced from three results in (Feller, 1971, Chap-
ter XIX): the theorem in Section 3, Bochner’s Theorem in Section 2, and Lemma 1
in Section 2.
Deﬁnition 25.7.2 (The PSD of a Continuous-Time WSS SP). We say that the
WSS continuous-time SP

X(t)

is of power spectral density (PSD) SXX if SXX
is a nonnegative, symmetric, integrable function from R to R whose Inverse Fourier
Transform is the autocovariance function KXX of

X(t)

:
KXX(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R.
(25.30)
4Engineers can, however, be a bit sloppy in that they sometimes speak of a SP whose PSD
is discontinuous, e.g., the Brickwall function f →I{|f| ≤W}. This is inconsistent with their
deﬁnition because the FT of an integrable function must be continuous (Theorem 6.2.11), and
consequently if the autocovariance function is integrable then its FT cannot be discontinuous.
Our more general deﬁnition does not suﬀer from this problem and allows for discontinuous PSDs.
5Recall that without additional assumptions one is not guaranteed that the Inverse Fourier
Transform of the Fourier Transform of a function will be identical to the original function. Here we
need not make any additional assumptions because we already assumed that the autocovariance
function is continuous and because autocovariance functions are positive deﬁnite.

Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
A few remarks regarding this deﬁnition:
(i) By the uniqueness of the IFT (the analogue of Theorem 6.2.12 for the IFT) it
follows that if two functions are PSDs of the same WSS SP, then they must be
equal except on a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero. Consequently,
we shall often speak of “the” PSD as though it were unique.
(ii) By Proposition 25.7.1, if KXX is continuous and integrable, then

X(t)

has
a PSD in the sense of Deﬁnition 25.7.2, and this PSD is the FT of KXX.
There are, however, autocovariance functions that are not integrable and
that nonetheless have a PSD in the sense of Deﬁnition 25.7.2. For example,
τ 	→sinc(τ).
Thus, every continuous autocovariance function that has a PSD in the en-
gineers’ sense (i.e., that is integrable) also has the same PSD according to
our deﬁnition, but our deﬁnition is more general in that some autocovariance
functions that have a PSD according to our deﬁnition are not integrable and
therefore do not have a PSD in the engineers’ sense.
(iii) By substituting τ = 0 in (25.30) and using (25.15) we can express the variance
of X(t) in terms of the PSD SXX as
Var

X(t)

= KXX(0) =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f) df,
t ∈R.
(25.31)
(iv) Only processes with continuous autocovariance functions have PSDs, because
the RHS of (25.30), being the IFT of an integrable function, must be contin-
uous (Theorem 6.2.11 (ii)).
(v) It can be shown that if the autocovariance function can be written as the
IFT of some integrable function, then this latter function must be nonneg-
ative (except on a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero). This is the
continuous-time analogue of Proposition 13.6.3.
The nonnegativity, symmetry, and integrability conditions characterize PSDs in
the following sense:
Proposition 25.7.3. Every nonnegative, symmetric, integrable function is the PSD
of some stationary Gaussian SP whose autocovariance function is continuous.
Proof. Let S(·) be some integrable, nonnegative, and symmetric function from R
to the nonnegative reals. Deﬁne K(·) to be its IFT
K(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
S(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R.
(25.32)
We shall verify that K(·) satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 25.6.2, namely, that
it is symmetric and positive deﬁnite. It will then follow from Theorem 25.6.2 that
.027
14:53:20, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at

25.8 The Spectral Distribution Function
573
there exists a stationary Gaussian SP

X(t)

whose autocovariance function KXX
is equal to K(·) and is thus given by
KXX(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
S(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R.
(25.33)
This will establish that

X(t)

is of PSD S(·). The continuity of KXX will follow
from the continuity of the IFT of integrable functions (Theorem 6.2.11).
To conclude the proof we need to show that the function K(·) deﬁned in (25.32)
is symmetric and positive deﬁnite. The symmetry follows from our assumption
that S(·) is symmetric:
K(−τ) =
 ∞

S(f) ei2πf(−τ) df
=

S(−˜f) ei2π ˜

τ ∈R,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from (25.32); the second from the change of variable
˜f ≜−f; the third by the symmetry of S(·); and the ﬁnal equality again by (25.32).
We next prove that K(·) is positive deﬁnite. To that end we ﬁx some n ∈N, some
constants α1, . . . , αn ∈R, and some epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R and compute:

positive deﬁnite functions and discuss its application to continuous autocovariance

functions. We shall then deﬁne the spectral distribution function of WSS stochastic
processes. The concept of a spectral distribution function is more general than
that of a PSD, because every WSS with a continuous autocovariance function has
a spectral distribution function, but only some have a PSD. Nevertheless, for our
purposes, the notion of PSD will suﬃce, and the results of this section will not be
used in the rest of the book.
Recall that the characteristic function ΦX(·) of a RV X is the mapping from R
to C deﬁned by
ϖ 	→E

eiϖX
,
ϖ ∈R.
(25.34)
If X is symmetric (i.e., has a symmetric distribution) in the sense that
Pr[X ≥x] = Pr[X ≤−x],
x ∈R,
(25.35)
then ΦX(·) only takes on real values and is a symmetric function, as the following
argument shows. The symmetry of the distribution of X implies that X and −X
have the same distribution, which implies that their exponentiations have the same
law
eiϖX
L= e−iϖX,
ϖ ∈R,
(25.36)
and a fortiori that the expectation of the two exponentials are equal
E

eiϖX
= E

e−iϖX
,
ϖ ∈R.
(25.37)
The LHS of (25.37) is ΦX(ϖ), and the RHS is ΦX(−ϖ), thus demonstrating the
symmetry of ΦX(·). To establish that (25.35) also implies that ΦX(·) is real, we
note that, by (25.37),
ΦX(ϖ) = E

which is real. Here the ﬁrst equality follows from (25.34); the second from (25.37);
and the third from the linearity of expectation.
Bochner’s Theorem establishes a correspondence between continuous, symmetric,
positive deﬁnite functions and characteristic functions.
Theorem 25.8.1 (Bochner’s Theorem). Let the mapping Φ(·) from R to R be
continuous. Then the following two conditions are equivalent:
a) Φ(·) is the characteristic function of some RV having a symmetric distribu-
tion.
b) Φ(·) is a symmetric positive deﬁnite function satisfying Φ(0) = 1.
Proof. See (Feller, 1971, Chapter XIX, Section 2) or (Lo`eve, 1963, Chapter IV,
Section 14) or (Katznelson, 2004, Chapter VI, Section 2.8).

25.8 The Spectral Distribution Function
575
Bochner’s Theorem is the key to understanding autocovariance functions:
Proposition 25.8.2. Let

X(t)

be a WSS SP whose autocovariance function KXX
is continuous. Then:
(i) There exists a symmetric RV S such that
KXX(τ) = KXX(0) E

ei2πτS
,
τ ∈R.
(25.38)
(ii) If KXX(0) > 0, then the distribution of S in (25.38) is uniquely determined
by KXX, and

X(t)

has a PSD if, and only if, S has a density.
Proof. If KXX(0) = 0, then

X(t)

is deterministic in the sense that for every
epoch t ∈R the variance of X(t) is zero. By the inequality |KXX(τ)| ≤KXX(0)
(Lemma 25.4.5, (25.16)) it follows that if KXX(0) = 0 then KXX(τ) = 0 for all
τ ∈R, and (25.38) holds in this case for any choice of S and there is nothing else
to prove.
Consider now the case KXX(0) > 0. To prove Part (i) we note that because KXX is
by assumption continuous, and because all autocovariance functions are symmetric
and positive deﬁnite (see (25.23) and (25.24)), it follows that the mapping
τ 	→KXX(τ)
KXX(0),
τ ∈R
is a continuous, symmetric, positive deﬁnite mapping that takes on the value one
at τ = 0. Consequently, by Bochner’s Theorem, there exists a RV R of a symmetric
distribution such that
KXX(τ)
KXX(0) = E

eiτR
,
τ ∈R.
It follows that if we deﬁne S as R/(2π) then (25.38) will hold, and Part (i) is thus
also established for the case where KXX(0) > 0.
We conclude the treatment of the case KXX(0) > 0 by proving Part (ii). That the
distribution of S is unique follows because (25.38) implies that
E

eiϖS
= KXX(ϖ/(2π))
KXX(0)
,
ϖ ∈R,
so KXX determines the characteristic function of S and hence also its distribution
(Theorem 17.4.4).
Because the distribution of S is symmetric, if S has a density then it also has a
symmetric density. Denote by fS(·) a symmetric density function for S. In terms
of fS(·) we can rewrite (25.38) as
KXX(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
KXX(0) fS(s) ei2πsτ ds,
τ ∈R,
so the nonnegative symmetric function KXX(0) fS(·) is a PSD of

Proposition 25.8.2 motivates us to deﬁne the spectral distribution function of a
continuous autocovariance function (or of a WSS SP having such an autocovariance
function) as follows.
Deﬁnition 25.8.3 (Spectral Distribution Function). The spectral distribution
function of a continuous autocovariance function KXX is the mapping
ξ 	→KXX(0) Pr[S ≤ξ],
(25.41)
where S is a random variable for which (25.38) holds.

The Average Power
We next address the average power in the sample-paths of a SP. We would like to
better understand formal expressions of the form


X(t)

deﬁned on the probability space (Ω, F, P). Recalling that if we ﬁx
ω ∈Ω then we can view the trajectory t 	→X(ω, t) as a function of time, we would
like to think about the integral above as the time-integral of the square of the
trajectory t 	→X(ω, t). Since the result of this integral is a (nonnegative) number
that depends on ω, we would like to view this result as a nonnegative RV
ω 	→1
T
 T/2
−T/2
X2(ω, t) dt,
ω ∈Ω.
Mathematicians, however, would object to our naive approach on two grounds. The
ﬁrst is that it is prima facie unclear whether for every ﬁxed ω ∈Ω the mapping
t 	→X2(ω, t) is suﬃciently well-behaved to allow us to discuss its integral. (It may
not be Lebesgue measurable.) The second is that, even if this integral could be
carried out for every ω ∈Ω, it is prima facie unclear that the result would be a
RV. While it would certainly be a mapping from Ω to the extended reals (allowing
for +∞), it is not clear that it would satisfy the technical measurability conditions
that random variables must meet.6
To address these objections we shall assume that

X(t)

is a “measurable stochastic
process.” This is a technical condition that will be foreign to most readers and
6By “X is a random variable possibly taking on the value +∞” we mean that X is a mapping
from Ω to R ∪{+∞} with the set {ω ∈Ω : X(ω) ≤ξ} being an event for every ξ ∈R and with
the set {ω ∈Ω : X(ω) = +∞} also being an event.

that will be inessential to the rest of this book. We mention it here because, in
order to be mathematically honest, we shall have to slip this attribute into some
of the theorems that we shall later state. Nothing will be lost on readers who
replace “measurable stochastic process” with “stochastic process satisfying a mild
technical condition.”
Fortunately, this technical condition is, indeed, very mild. For example, Propo-
sition 25.7.3 still holds if we slip in the attribute “measurable” before the words
“Gaussian process.” Similarly, in Theorem 25.6.2, if we add the hypothesis that
the given function is continuous at the origin, then we can slip in the attribute
“measurable” before the words “stationary Gaussian stochastic process.”7
For the beneﬁt of readers who are familiar with Measure Theory, we provide the
following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 25.9.1 (Measurable SP). Let

X(t), t ∈R

be a SP deﬁned over the
probability space (Ω, F, P). We say that the process is a measurable stochastic
process if the mapping (ω, t) 	→X(ω, t) is a measurable mapping from Ω × R
to R when the codomain R is endowed with the Borel σ-algebra on R and when the
domain Ω × R is endowed with the σ-algebra deﬁned by the product of F on Ω and
the Borel σ-algebra on R.
The nice thing about measurable stochastic processes is that if

X(t)

is a measur-
able SP, then for every ω ∈Ω the trajectory t 	→X(ω, t) is a Borel (and hence also
Lebesgue) measurable function of time; see (Halmos, 1950, Chapter 7, Section 34,
Theorem B) or (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 3, Section 18, Theorem 18.1 (ii)). More-
over, for such processes we can sometimes use Fubini’s Theorem to swap the order
in which we compute time-integrals and expectations; see (Halmos, 1950, Chap-
ter 7, Section 36) or (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 3, Section 18, Theorem 18.3 (ii)).
We can now state the main result of this section regarding the average power in a
WSS SP.
Proposition 25.9.2 (Power in a Centered WSS SP). If

X(t)

is a measurable,
centered, WSS SP deﬁned over the probability space (Ω, F, P) and having the au-
tocovariance function KXX, then, for every a, b ∈R satisfying a < b, the mapping
ω 	→
1
b −a

X2(ω, t) dt
(25.42)
deﬁnes a RV (possibly taking on the value +∞) satisfying
1
b −a E
 b
a
X2(t) dt

= KXX(0).
(25.43)
Proof. The proof of (25.43) is straightforward and merely requires swapping the
order of integration and expectation. This swap can be justiﬁed using Fubini’s The-
orem. Heuristically, the swapping of expectation and integration can be justiﬁed by
7These are but very special cases of a much more general result that states that given FDDs
corresponding to a WSS SP of an autocovariance that is continuous at the origin, there exists
a SP of the given FDDs that is also measurable. See, for example, (Doob, 1990, Chapter II,
Section § 2, Theorem 2.6). (Replacing the values ±∞with zero may ruin the separability but
not the measurability.)

is centered implies
that, for every t ∈R, the RV X(t) is centered and by (25.14); and the ﬁnal equality
holds because the integrand is constant.
That (25.42) is a RV (possibly taking on the value +∞) follows from Fubini’s

Stochastic Integrals and Linear Functionals
For the problem of detecting continuous-time signals corrupted by noise, we shall
be interested in stochastic integrals of the form
 ∞
−∞
X(t) s(t) dt
(25.44)
for WSS stochastic processes

X(t)

deﬁned over a probability space (Ω, F, P)
and for properly well-behaved deterministic functions s(·). We would like to think
about the result of such an integral as a RV
ω 	→
 ∞
−∞
X(ω, t) s(t) dt
(25.45)
that maps each ω ∈Ω to the real number that is the result of the integration
over time of the product of the trajectory t 	→X(ω, t) corresponding to ω by the
deterministic function t 	→s(t). That is, each ω is mapped to the inner product
between its trajectory t 	→X(ω, t) and the function s(·).
This is an excellent way of thinking about such integrals, but we do run into
some mathematical objections similar to those we encountered in Section 25.9.

579
For example, it is not obvious that for each ω ∈Ω the mapping t 	→X(ω, t) s(t)
is a suﬃciently well-behaved function for the time-integral to be deﬁned. As we
shall see, for this reason we must impose certain restrictions on s(·), and we will
not claim that t 	→X(ω, t) s(t) is integrable for every ω ∈Ω but only for ω’s in
some subset of Ω having probability one. Also, even if this issue is addressed, it is
unclear whether the mapping of ω to the result of the integration is a RV: while it
is clearly a mapping from Ω to the reals, it is unclear that it satisﬁes the additional
mathematical requirement of measurability, i.e., that for every ξ ∈R the set
1
ω ∈Ω :
 ∞
−∞
X(ω, t) s(t) dt ≤ξ
2
be an event, i.e., an element of F.
We ask the reader to take it on faith that these issues can be resolved and to focus
on the relatively straightforward computation of the mean and variance of (25.45).
The resolution of the measurability issues is provided in Proposition 25.10.1, whose
proof is recommended only to readers with background in Measure Theory.
We shall assume throughout that

X(t)

is WSS and that the deterministic function
s: R →R is integrable. We begin by heuristically deriving the mean:

(25.46)
with the following informal justiﬁcation. The ﬁrst equality follows by swapping
the expectation with the time-integration; the second because s(·) is deterministic;
and the last equality from our assumption that

X(t)

is WSS, which implies that

X(t)

is of constant mean: E[X(t)] = E[X(0)] for all t ∈R.
We next heuristically derive the variance of the integral in terms of the autocovari-
ance function KXX of the process

X(t)

. We begin by considering the case where

X(t)

Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
where the ﬁrst equality follows because (25.46) and our assumption that

X(t)

is centered combine to guarantee that

X(t) s(t) dt is of zero mean; the second
by writing a2 as a times a; the third by writing the product of integrals over R
as a double integral (i.e., as an integral over R2); the fourth by swapping the
double-integral with the expectation; and the ﬁnal equality by the deﬁnition of the
autocovariance function (Deﬁnition 25.4.4) and because

X(t)

is centered.
There are two equivalent ways of writing the RHS of (25.47) that we wish to point
out. The ﬁrst is obtained from (25.47) by changing the integration variables from
(t, τ) to (σ, τ), where σ ≜t −τ and by performing the integration ﬁrst over τ and
then over σ:

(25.48)
where Rss is the self-similarity function of s (Deﬁnition 11.2.1 and Section 11.4).
The second equivalent way of writing (25.47) can be derived from (25.48) when

X(t)

is of PSD SXX. Since (25.48) has the form of an inner product, we can use
Proposition 6.2.4 to write this inner product in the frequency domain by noting
that the FT of Rss is f 	→|ˆs(f)|2 (see (11.35)) and that KXX is the IFT of its
PSD SXX. The result is that

We next show that (25.47) (and hence also (25.48) & (25.49), which are equivalent
ways of writing (25.47)) remains valid also when

X(t)

is of mean μ (not neces-

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of ˜X(t) as X(t) −μ; the second
by the linearity of integration; the third because adding a deterministic quantity
to a RV does not change its covariance; the fourth by (25.47) applied to the zero-
mean process
 ˜X(t)

; and the ﬁnal equality because the autocovariance function
of
 ˜X(t)

is the same as the autocovariance function of

X(t)

(Deﬁnition 25.4.4).
As above, once a result is proved for centered stochastic processes, its extension
to WSS stochastic processes with a mean can be straightforward. Consequently,
we shall often derive our results for centered WSS stochastic processes and leave
it to the reader to extend them to mean-μ stochastic processes by expressing such
stochastic processes as the sum of a zero-mean SP and the deterministic constant μ.
As promised, we now state the results about the mean and variance of (25.45) in
a mathematically defensible proposition.
Proposition 25.10.1 (Mean and Variance of Stochastic Integrals). Let

X(t)

be a measurable WSS SP deﬁned over the probability space (Ω, F, P) and having
the autocovariance function KXX. Let s: R →R be some deterministic integrable
function. Then:
(i) For every ω ∈Ω, the mapping t 	→X(ω, t) s(t) is Lebesgue measurable.
(ii) The set
N ≜
1
ω ∈Ω :
 ∞
−∞

(25.51)
is an event and its probability is zero.
(iii) The mapping from Ω \ N to R deﬁned by

which can also be expressed as
 ∞

KXX(σ) Rss(σ) dσ,
(25.56)
where Rss is the self-similarity function of s.
(vii) If

is of PSD SXX, then the variance of this RV can be expressed as
 ∞

(25.57)
Proof. Part (i) follows because the measurability of the process

X(t)

guarantees
that for every ω ∈Ω the mapping t 	→X(ω, t) is Borel measurable and hence a
fortiori Lebesgue measurable; see (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 3, Section 18, Theo-
rem 18.1 (ii)).
If s happens to be Borel measurable, then Parts (ii)–(v) follow directly by Fubini’s
Theorem (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 3, Section 18, Theorem 18.3) because in this
case the mapping (ω, t) 	→X(ω, t) s(t) is measurable (with respect to the product
of F by the Borel σ-algebra on the real line) and because

E[X2(0)]
 ∞
−∞
|s(t)| dt
< ∞,
where the ﬁrst inequality follows from (25.17), and where the second inequality
follows from our assumption that s is integrable.
To prove Parts (i)–(v) for the case where s is Lebesgue measurable but not Borel
measurable, recall that every Lebesgue measurable function is equal (except on
a set of Lebesgue measure zero) to a Borel measurable function (Rudin, 1987,
Chapter 8, Lemma 1 or Chapter 2, Exercise 14), and note that the RHS of (25.51)
and the mappings in (25.52) and (25.53) are unaltered when s is replaced with a
function that is identical to it outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
We next prove Part (vi) under the assumption that

X(t)

is centered. The more
general case then follows from the argument leading to (25.50). To prove Part (vi)
we need to justify the steps leading to (25.47). For the reader’s convenience we
repeat these steps here and then proceed to justify them.

The ﬁrst equality follows from Part (v) and the assumption that

the second follows by writing a2 as a times a; the third follows because for ω’s sat-
isfying

|X(ω, t) s(t)| dt < ∞we can use Fubini’s Theorem to replace the iterated
integrals with a double integral and because other ω’s occur with zero probability
and therefore do not inﬂuence the expectation; the fourth equality entails swap-
ping the expectation with the integration over R2 and can be justiﬁed by Fubini’s
Theorem because, by (25.18),

and the ﬁnal equality follows from the deﬁnition of the autocovariance function
(Deﬁnition 25.4.4).
Having derived (25.55) we can derive (25.56) by following the steps leading to
(25.48). The only issue that needs clariﬁcation is the justiﬁcation for replacing
the integral over R2 with the iterated integrals. This is justiﬁed using Fubini’s
Theorem by noting that, by (25.16), | KXX(σ)| ≤KXX(0) and that s is integrable:

Finally, Part (vii) follows from (25.56) and from Proposition 6.2.4 by noting that,
by (11.34) & (11.35), Rss is integrable and of FT
ˆRss(f) =
ˆs(f)

f ∈R,
and that, by Deﬁnition 25.7.2, if SXX is the PSD of

instead of the mathematically more explicit (25.53) & (25.51). Sometimes,
however, we shall make the argument ω ∈Ω more explicit:

(ii) If s1 and s2 are indistinguishable integrable real signals (Deﬁnition 2.5.2),
then the random variables

(iv) We caution the very careful readers that if s1 and s2 are integrable func-
tions, then there may be some ω’s in Ω for which the stochastic integral

integrals
 ∞

that either

|X(ω, t) s1(t)| dt or

|X(ω, t) s2(t)| dt is inﬁnite, but not both.
Fortunately, as we shall see in Lemma 25.10.3, such ω’s occur with zero prob-
ability.
(v) The value that we have chosen to assign to the integral in (25.53) when ω is
in N is immaterial. Such ω’s occur with zero probability, so this value does
not inﬂuence the distribution of the integral.8

By the Union Bound (or more speciﬁcally by Corollary 21.5.2 (i)), the set on the
RHS is of probability zero. The proof is concluded by noting that, outside this
set, the random variables (25.59) and (25.60) are identical. This follows because,
for ω’s outside this set, all the integrals are ﬁnite so linearity holds.
In view of the linearity of stochastic integration (Lemma 25.10.3), we shall adopt
the following terminology.9
Deﬁnition 25.10.5 (Linear Functional of a SP). A linear functional of a SP

X(t)

is an expression of the form
 ∞
−∞
X(t) s(t) dt +
n

ν=1
αν X(tν),
(25.62)
where s: R →R is some deterministic integrable function; n is a nonnegative
integer; the constants α1, . . . , αn are real; and so are the epochs t1, . . . , tn. When n
is zero the linear functional reduces to a stochastic integral.
25.11
Linear Functionals of Gaussian Processes
We continue our discussion of linear functionals of stochastic processes, but this
time with the additional assumption that the underlying SP is Gaussian.
The
main result of this section is Proposition 25.11.1, which states that, subject to
some technical conditions, linear functionals of Gaussian stochastic processes are
Gaussian random variables. That is, if

X(t)

is a stationary Gaussian SP, then
 ∞

reals has the form (25.62).

is a Gaussian RV. Consequently, the distribution of such a functional is fully speci-
ﬁed by its mean and variance, which, as we shall see, can be easily computed from
the autocovariance function KXX of

X(t)

.
The proof of the Gaussianity of (25.63) (Proposition 25.11.1 ahead) is technical,
so we encourage the reader to focus on the following heuristic argument. Suppose
that the integral is a Riemann integral and that we can therefore approximate it
with a ﬁnite sum
 ∞
−∞
X(t) s(t) dt ≈
K

k=−K
δ X(δk) s(δk)
for some large enough K and small enough δ > 0. (Do not bother trying to sort
out the exact sense in which this approximation holds. This is, after all, a heuristic
argument.) Consequently, we can approximate (25.63) by
 ∞
−∞
X(t) s(t) dt +
n

ν=1
αν X(tν) ≈
K

k=−K
δ s(δk) X(δk) +
n

ν=1
αν X(tν).
(25.64)
But the RHS of the above is just a linear combination of the random variables
X(−Kδ), . . . , X(Kδ), X(t1), . . . , X(tn),
which are jointly Gaussian because

X(t)

is a Gaussian SP. Since a linear func-
tional of jointly Gaussian random variables is Gaussian (Theorem 23.6.17), the
RHS of (25.64) is Gaussian, thus making it plausible that its LHS is also Gaussian.
Before stating the main result of this section in a mathematically defensible way,
we now proceed to compute the mean and variance of (25.63). We assume that s(·)
is integrable and that

X(t)

is measurable and WSS. (Gaussianity is inessential
for the computation of the mean and variance.) The computation is very similar
to the one leading to (25.46) and (25.47). For the mean we have:

where the ﬁrst equality follows from the linearity of expectation and where the
second equality follows from (25.46) and from the wide-sense stationarity of

X(t)

,
which implies that E[X(t)] = E[X(0)], for all t ∈R.
For the purpose of computing the variance of (25.63), we assume that

X(t)

is
centered. The result continues to hold if

X(t)

has a nonzero mean, because the
mean of

X(t)

does not inﬂuence the variance of (25.63). We begin by expanding
the variance as

We now state the main result about linear functionals of Gaussian stochastic pro-
cesses. The proof is recommended for mathematically-inclined readers only.
Proposition 25.11.1 (Linear Functional of a Stationary Gaussian SP). Consider
the setup of Proposition 25.10.1 with the additional assumption that

X(t)

is a
Gaussian SP. Additionally introduce the coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn ∈R and the epochs
t1, . . . , tn ∈R for some n ∈N. Then there exists an event N ∈F of zero probability
such that for all ω /∈N the mapping t 	→X(ω, t) s(t) is a Lebesgue integrable
function:

X(t)

and that is equal to the RV in (25.71b) with probability one.10
10In the future, when we write (25.63) we shall refer to such a RV.

Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
Proof. We prove this result when

X(t)

is centered. The extension to the more
general case follows by noting that adding a deterministic constant to a zero-mean
Gaussian results in a Gaussian. We also assume that s(·) is Borel measurable,
because once the theorem is established for this case it immediately also extends
to the case where s(·) is only Lebesgue measurable by noting that every Lebesgue
measurable function is equal almost everywhere to a Borel measurable function.
The existence of the event N and the fact that the mapping (25.71b) is a RV follow
from Proposition 25.10.1. We next show that the RV

It follows from (25.74) that the sequence Y1, Y2, . . . converges almost surely to Y .
To prove that Y is Gaussian, it thus suﬃces to prove that for every k ∈N the RV
Yk is Gaussian (Theorem 19.9.1).
To prove that Yk is Gaussian, we begin by showing that it is of ﬁnite variance. To
that end, it suﬃces to show that the RV

where the equality in the ﬁrst line follows from the deﬁnition of ˜Yk (25.76); the
equality in the second line from the deﬁnition of sk(·) (25.73); the inequality in the
third line from the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality; and the ﬁnal inequality again by
(25.73). Since N is an event of probability zero, it follows from this inequality that
E
 ˜Y 2
k

≤4k3 KXX(0) < ∞,
thus establishing that ˜Yk, and hence also Yk, is of ﬁnite variance.
To prove that Yk is Gaussian, we shall use some results about the Hilbert space
L2(Ω, F, P) of (the equivalence classes of) the random variables that are deﬁned
over (Ω, F, P) and that have a ﬁnite second moment; see, for example, (Shiryaev,
1996, Chapter II, Section 11). Let G denote the closed linear subspace of L2(Ω, F, P)
that is generated by the random variables

X(t), t ∈R

. Thus, G contains all ﬁ-
nite linear combinations of the random variables

X(t), t ∈R

as well as the
mean-square limits of such linear combinations. Since the process

X(t), t ∈R

is
Gaussian, all such linear combinations are Gaussian. And since mean-square lim-
its of Gaussian random variables are Gaussian (Theorem 19.9.1), it follows that G
contains only random variables that have a Gaussian distribution (Shiryaev, 1996,
Chapter II, Section 13, Paragraph 6). To prove that Yk is Gaussian, it thus suﬃces
to show that it is an element of G.
To prove that Yk is an element of G, decompose Yk as
Yk = Y G
k + Y ⊥
k ,
(25.77)
where Y G
k is the projection of Yk onto G and where Y ⊥
k is consequently perpendic-
ular to every element of G and a fortiori to all the random variables

an application of Fubini’s Theorem that we shall justify shortly; the ﬁfth because
sk(·) is a deterministic function; and the ﬁnal equality again by (25.78).
This
establishes (25.81) subject to a veriﬁcation that the conditions of Fubini’s Theorem
are satisﬁed, a veriﬁcation we conduct now. That (ω, t) 	→X(ω, t) Y ⊥
k (ω) sk(t) is
measurable follows because

X(t), t ∈R

is a measurable SP; Y ⊥
k , being a RV,
is measurable with respect to F; and because the Borel measurability of s(·) also
implies the Borel measurability of sk(·). The integrability of this function follows
from the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for random variables

where the second inequality follows from the deﬁnition of sk(·) (25.73), and where
the third inequality follows from (25.79). This justiﬁes the use of Fubini’s Theorem
in the proof of (25.81). We have thus demonstrated that Yk is in G, and hence, like
all elements of G, is Gaussian. This concludes the proof of the Gaussianity of Yk
for every k ∈N and hence the Gaussianity of Y .
We next verify that the mean and variance of Y are as stated in the theorem. The
only part of the derivation of (25.70) that we have not yet justiﬁed is the derivation
of (25.69) and, in particular, the swapping of the expectation and integration. But
this is easily justiﬁed using Fubini’s Theorem because, by (25.18),

25.12 The Joint Distribution of Linear Functionals
591
We now conclude the proof by showing that there exists a RV that is measurable
with respect to the σ-algebra generated by

X(t)

and that is equal to Y with
probability one. The elements of G are all (equivalence classes of) random variables
that are measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by

X(t)

, because
they are all linear combinations of the random variables

X(t), t ∈R

or limits
thereof. Consequently, by (25.77) and (25.80), the RV Yk is equal with probability
one to a RV that is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by

X(t)

.
Since Yk converges almost surely to Y , the same must be true of Y .
Proposition 25.11.1 is extremely powerful because it allows us to determine the
distribution of a linear functional of a Gaussian SP from its mean and variance.
In the next section we shall extend this result and show that any ﬁnite number of
linear functionals of a Gaussian SP are jointly Gaussian. Their joint distribution
is thus fully determined by the mean vector and the covariance matrix, which, as
we shall see, can be readily computed from the autocovariance function.
25.12
The Joint Distribution of Linear Functionals
Let us now shift our focus from the distribution of a single linear functional to the
joint distribution of a collection of such functionals. Speciﬁcally, we consider m

nals s1, . . . , sm are integrable, n1, . . . , nm are in N, and αj,ν, tj,ν are deterministic
constants for all ν ∈{1, . . . , nj}.
The main result of this section is that if

X(t)

is a Gaussian SP, then the random
variables in (25.83) are jointly Gaussian.
Theorem 25.12.1 (Linear Functionals of a Gaussian SP Are Jointly Gaussian).

gers {nj} are nonnegative; and the coeﬃcients {αj,ν} and the epochs {tj,ν} are
deterministic real numbers for all j ∈{1, . . . , m} and all ν ∈{1, . . . , nj}.
Proof. It suﬃces to show that any linear combination of these linear function-
als has a univariate Gaussian distribution (Theorem 23.6.17). This follows from
Proposition 25.11.1 and Lemma 25.10.3 because, by Lemma 25.10.3, for any choice

which, by Proposition 25.11.1, has a univariate Gaussian distribution.
It follows from Theorem 25.12.1 that if

X(t)

is a measurable, stationary, Gaussian
SP, then the joint distribution of the random variables in (25.83) is fully speciﬁed
by their means and their covariance matrix. If

is centered, then by (25.65)
these random variables are centered, so their joint distribution is determined by
their covariance matrix. We next show how this covariance matrix can be computed
from the autocovariance function KXX.
To this end we assume that

Proof. Most of these claims have already been proved. Indeed, (25.88) was proved
in Proposition 25.10.1 (vi), and (25.89) was proved in Proposition 25.11.1 using
Fubini’s Theorem and (25.82).
However, (25.90) was only derived heuristically
in (25.85) and (25.86). To rigorously justify this derivation one can use Fubini’s
Theorem, or use the relation
Cov[X, Y ] = 1


Var[X + Y ] −Var[X] −Var[Y ]

and the result for the variance, namely, (25.88).
All the results in Part (ii) of this theorem follow from the corresponding results in
Part (i) using the deﬁnition of the PSD and Proposition 6.2.4.
25.13
Filtering WSS Processes
We next discuss the result of passing a WSS SP through a stable ﬁlter, i.e., the
convolution of a SP with a deterministic integrable function. Our main result is
that, subject to some technical conditions, the following hold:
(i) Passing a WSS SP through a stable ﬁlter produces a WSS SP.
(ii) If the input to the ﬁlter is of PSD SXX, then the output of the ﬁlter is of
PSD f 	→SXX(f) |ˆh(f)|2, where ˆh(·) is the ﬁlter’s frequency response.
(iii) If the input to the ﬁlter is a Gaussian SP, then so is the output.
We state this result in Theorem 25.13.2. But ﬁrst we must deﬁne the convolution
of a SP with an integrable deterministic signal. Our approach is to build on our
deﬁnition of linear functionals of WSS stochastic processes (Section 25.10) and to
deﬁne the convolution of

with h(·) as the SP that maps every epoch t ∈R

where

(25.102)
We are now ready to prove Part (i).

t, τ ∈R,
(25.105)
where the RHS does not depend on t. This establishes that

Y (t)

is WSS and
proves (25.95).13
To conclude the proof of Part (i) we now show that

Y (t)

is measurable. The proof
is technical and requires background in Measure Theory. Readers are encouraged
to skip it and move on to the proof of Part (ii).
We ﬁrst note that, as in the proof of Proposition 25.10.1, it suﬃces to prove the
result for impulse response functions h that are Borel measurable; the extension
to Lebesgue measurable functions will then follow by approximating h by a Borel
measurable function that diﬀers from it on a set of Lebesgue measure zero (Rudin,
1987, Chapter 8, Lemma 1 or Chapter 2, Exercise 14) and by then applying Part (ii)
of Note 25.10.2. We hence now assume that h is Borel measurable.
We shall prove that

Y (t)

is measurable by proving that the (nonstationary)
process (ω, t) 	→Y (ω, t)/(1 + t2) is measurable. This we shall prove using Fubini’s
Theorem applied to the function from (Ω × R) × R to R deﬁned by

(ω, t), σ

	→X(ω, σ) h(t −σ)
1 + t2
,

(ω, t) ∈Ω × R, σ ∈R

.
(25.106)
This function is measurable because, by assumption,

X(t)

is measurable and
because the measurability of the function h(·) implies the measurability of the
function (t, σ) 	→h(t −σ) (as proved, for example, in (Rudin, 1987, p. 171)). We
next verify that this function is integrable.
To that end, we ﬁrst integrate its
absolute value over (ω, t) and then over σ. The integral over (ω, t) is given by
 ∞
t=−∞
E[|X(σ)|] |h(t −σ)|
1 + t2
dt ≤

KXX(0)
 ∞
t=−∞
|h(t −σ)|
1 + t2
dt,
where the inequality follows from (25.17) and from our assumption that

X(t)

is
centered. We next need to integrate the RHS over σ. Invoking Fubini’s Theorem
to exchange the order of integration over t and σ we obtain that the integral of the
absolute value of the function deﬁned in (25.106) is upper-bounded by
 ∞

Having established that the function in (25.106) is measurable and integrable, we
can now use Fubini’s Theorem to deduce that its integral over σ is measurable as
13That

Y (t)

is of ﬁnite variance follows from (25.105) by setting τ = 0 and noting that
the convolution on the RHS of (25.105) is between a bounded function (KXX) and an integrable
function (Rhh) and is thus deﬁned and ﬁnite at every τ ∈R and a fortiori at τ = 0.

(ω, t) 	→
 ∞
σ=−∞
X(ω, σ) h(t −σ)

(25.107)
is measurable. This mapping is no other than the mapping (ω, t) 	→Y (ω, t)/(1+t2),
so the latter must also be measurable, and hence also (ω, t) 	→Y (ω, t).
We next prove Part (ii) using (25.95) and Proposition 6.2.5. Because h is integrable,
its self-similarity function Rhh is integrable and of FT
ˆRhh(f) =
ˆh(f)
2,
f ∈R
(25.108)
(Section 11.4). And since, by assumption,

X(t)

is of PSD SXX, it follows that SXX
is integrable and that its IFT is KXX:
KXX(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
SXX(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R.
(25.109)
Consequently, by Proposition 6.2.5,

KXX ⋆Rhh

(τ) =
 ∞
−∞
ˆh(f)
2 SXX(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R.
Combining this with (25.95) yields
KYY (τ) =
 ∞
−∞
ˆh(f)
2 SXX(f) ei2πfτ df,
τ ∈R,
and thus establishes that the PSD of

Y (t)

is as given in (25.96).
We next turn to Part (iii). To establish (25.97) we use the representation (25.100)
& (25.102) and Theorem 25.12.2:

τ ∈R,
where μ ≜σ −t, and where we have used the symmetry of the autocovariance
function.
Finally, we prove Part (iv). The proof is a simple application of Theorem 25.12.1.
To prove that

Y (t)

is a Gaussian process we need to show that, for every pos-
itive integer n and for every choice of the epochs t1, . . . , tn, the random variables
.027
14:53:20, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at

25.13 Filtering WSS Processes
599
Y (t1), . . . , Y (tn) are jointly Gaussian. This follows directly from Theorem 25.12.1
because Y (tν) can be expressed as
Y (tν) =
 ∞
−∞
X(σ) h(tν −σ) dσ
=
 ∞
−∞
X(σ) sν(σ) dσ,
ν = 1, . . . , n,
where
sν : σ 	→h(tν −σ),
ν = 1, . . . , n
are all integrable.
The joint Gaussianity of the random variables in (25.98) can also be deduced from
Theorem 25.12.1. Indeed, X(tν) can be trivially expressed as the functional
X(tν) =
 ∞
−∞
X(σ) sν(σ) dσ + ανX(tν),
ν = 1, . . . , n
when sν is chosen to be the zero function and when αν is chosen as 1, and Y (tν)
can be similarly expressed as
Y (tν) =
 ∞
−∞
X(σ) sν(σ) dσ + ανX(tν),
ν = n + 1, . . . , n + m
when sν : σ 	→h(tν −σ) and αν = 0.
The mathematically astute reader may have noted that, in deﬁning the result of
passing a WSS SP through a stable ﬁlter of impulse response h, we did not preclude
the possibility that for every ω there may be some epochs t for which the mapping
σ 	→X(ω, σ) h(t −σ) is not integrable.
So far, we have only established that
for every epoch t the set Nt of ω’s for which this mapping is not integrable is of
probability zero.
We next show that if h is well-behaved in the sense that it is not only integrable
but also satisﬁes
 ∞
−∞
h2(t) (1 + t2) dt < ∞,
(25.110)
then whenever ω is outside some set N ⊂Ω of probability zero, the mapping
σ 	→X(ω, σ) h(t −σ) is integrable for all t ∈R. Thus, for ω’s outside this set of
probability zero, we can think of the response of the ﬁlter as being the convolution
of the trajectory t 	→X(ω, t) and the impulse response t 	→h(t). For such ω’s this
convolution never blows up.
To prove this note that if h satisﬁes (25.110) and if the trajectory t 	→X(ω, t)
satisﬁes
 ∞
−∞
X2(ω, t)
1 + t2
dt < ∞,
(25.111)
then the function σ 	→X(ω, σ) h(t −σ) is integrable for every t ∈R (Proposi-
tion 3.4.4). To prove the claim it thus remains to prove that outside a set of ω’s of
probability zero, all the trajectories t 	→X(ω, t) satisfy (25.111):

(25.115)

The PSD Revisited
Theorem 25.13.2 describes the PSD of the output of a stable ﬁlter that is fed a
WSS SP

X(t)

. By integrating this PSD, we obtain the value at the origin of the
autocovariance function of the ﬁlter’s output (see (25.31)). Since the latter is the
power of the ﬁlter’s output (Corollary 25.9.3), we have:
Theorem 25.14.1 (Wiener-Khinchin). If a measurable, centered, WSS SP

X(t)

of autocovariance function KXX is passed through a stable ﬁlter of impulse response
h: R →R, then the average power of the ﬁlter’s output is given by

(25.117)
Proof. To prove (25.116), we note that by (25.95) the autocovariance function of
the ﬁltered process is KXX ⋆Rhh, which evaluates at the origin to (25.116). The
result thus follows from Proposition 25.9.2, which shows that the power in the
ﬁltered process is given by its autocovariance function evaluated at the origin.
To prove (25.117), we note that KXX is the IFT of SXX and that, by (11.35),
ˆRhh(f) = |ˆh(f)|2, so the RHS of (25.117) is equal to the RHS of (25.116) by
Proposition 6.2.4.
We next show that for WSS stochastic processes, the operational PSD (Deﬁni-
tion 15.3.1) and the PSD (Deﬁnition 25.7.2) are equivalent. That is, a WSS SP
has an operational PSD if, and only if, it has a PSD, and if the two exist, then they
are equal (outside a set of frequencies of Lebesgue measure zero). Before stating
this as a theorem, we present a lemma that will be needed in the proof. It is very
much in the spirit of Lemma 15.3.5.
Lemma 25.14.2. Let g: R →R be a symmetric continuous function satisfying the
condition that for every integrable real signal h: R →R
 ∞
−∞
g(t) Rhh(t) dt = 0.
(25.118)
Then g is the all-zero function.
Proof. For every a > 0 consider the function

√a I{|t| ≤a/2},
t ∈R
whose self-similarity function is
Rhh(t) =
	
1 −|t|

I{|t| ≤a},
t ∈R.

Since h is integrable, it follows from (25.118) that

Theorem 25.14.3 (The PSD and Operational PSD of a WSS SP). Let

X(t)

be a measurable, centered, WSS SP of a continuous autocovariance function KXX.
Let S(·) be a nonnegative, symmetric, integrable function. Then the following two
conditions are equivalent:
(a) KXX is the Inverse Fourier Transform of S(·).
(b) For every integrable h: R →R, the power in X ⋆h is given by
Power of X ⋆h =
 ∞
−∞
S(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df.
(25.123)
Proof. That (a) implies (b) follows from the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem because
(a) implies that

X(t)

is of PSD S(·). It remains to prove that (b) implies (a). We
thus assume that Condition (b) is satisﬁed and proceed to prove that KXX must
then be equal to the IFT of S(·). By Theorem 25.14.1, the power in X ⋆h is given
by (25.116). Consequently, Condition (b) implies that
 ∞
−∞
S(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df =
 ∞
−∞
KXX(τ) Rhh(τ) dτ,
(25.124)
for every integrable h: R →R.
If h is integrable, then the FT of Rhh is the mapping f 	→|ˆh(f)|2 (see (11.35)). If,
in addition, h is a real signal, then Rhh is a symmetric function, and its IFT is thus
identical to its FT (Proposition 6.2.3 (ii)). Thus, if h is real and integrable, then
the IFT of Rhh is the mapping f 	→|ˆh(f)|2. (Using the dummy variable f for the
IFT is unusual but legitimate.) Consequently, by Proposition 6.2.4 (applied with
the substitution of S(·) for x and of Rhh for g),
 ∞

S(f) |ˆh(f)|2 df =

White Gaussian Noise
The most important continuous-time SP in Digital Communications is white
Gaussian noise (WGN), which is often used to model the additive noise in com-
munication systems. In this section we deﬁne this process and study its key proper-
ties. Our deﬁnition diﬀers from the one in most textbooks, most notably in that we
deﬁne WGN only with respect to some given bandwidth W. We give our reasons
and comment on the implications in Section 25.15.3 after providing our deﬁnition
and deriving the key results.
25.15.1
Deﬁnition and Main Properties
The parameters deﬁning WGN are the bandwidth W with respect to which the
process is white and the double-sided power spectral density N0/2.
Deﬁnition 25.15.1 (White Gaussian Noise). We say that

N(t)

is white Gaus-
sian noise of double-sided power spectral density N0/2 with respect to
the bandwidth W if

N(t)

is a measurable, stationary, centered, Gaussian SP
that has a PSD SNN satisfying
SNN(f) = N0
2 ,
f ∈[−W, W ].
(25.127)
An example of the PSD of white Gaussian noise of double-sided PSD N0/2 with
respect to the bandwidth W is depicted in Figure 25.3. Note that our deﬁnition
of WGN only speciﬁes the PSD for frequencies f satisfying |f| ≤W. We leave the
value of the PSD at other frequencies unspeciﬁed. But the PSD should, of course,
be a valid PSD, i.e., it must be nonnegative, symmetric, and integrable (Deﬁni-
tion 25.7.2). Recall also that by Proposition 25.7.3 every nonnegative, symmetric,
integrable function is the PSD of some measurable stationary Gaussian SP.14
The following proposition summarizes the key properties of WGN. The reader is
encouraged to recall the deﬁnition of an integrable function that is bandlimited to
W Hz (Deﬁnition 6.4.9); the deﬁnition of the inner product between two energy-
limited real signals (3.1); the deﬁnition of ∥s∥2 as

⟨s, s⟩; and the deﬁnition of
orthonormality of the functions φ1, . . . , φm (Deﬁnition 4.6.1).
14As we have noted in the paragraph preceding Deﬁnition 25.9.1, Proposition 25.7.3 can be
strengthened to also guarantee measurability.
Every nonnegative, symmetric, and integrable
function is the PSD of some measurable, stationary, and Gaussian SP whose autocovariance
function is continuous.

lows from Theorem 25.12.1.
We ﬁrst note that since {sj} are assumed to be
integrable and bandlimited to W Hz, and since Note 6.4.12 guarantees that every
bandlimited integrable signal is also of ﬁnite energy, it follows that the functions
{sj} are energy-limited and the inner products ⟨sj, sk⟩are well-deﬁned. To ap-
ply Theorem 25.12.1 it remains to calculate the covariance between the diﬀerent
functionals. By (25.93),

Proposition 6.4.10 (cf. (b)).
25.15.2
Projecting White Gaussian Noise
A natural way to deﬁne the projection of a stochastic process is pathwise. Ignoring
integrability issues, we would deﬁne the projection as follows: Suppose we are
given orthonormal deterministic signals φ1, . . . , φd and a SP X that we would like
to project onto span(φ1, . . . , φd). For each ω ∈Ω we could consider the sample-
path t 	→X(ω, t) and deﬁne its projection, like we did for deterministic signals (see
Deﬁnition 4.6.6 and Note 4.6.7), as the signal
t 	→
d

ℓ=1
	 ∞
−∞
X(ω, τ) φℓ(τ) dτ

φℓ(t),
(25.130a)
i.e., as
t 	→
d

ℓ=1
⟨X, φℓ⟩(ω) φℓ(t).
(25.130b)
Diﬀerent sample-paths will, of course, have diﬀerent projections, thus resulting in
the projection being a stochastic process
(ω, t) 	→
d

ℓ=1
⟨X, φℓ⟩(ω) φℓ(t).
(25.130c)
For this to make mathematical sense we need to make sure that the stochastic
integrals in (25.130a) exist (with probability one). We shall therefore limit ourselves
to scenarios where φ1, . . . , φd are integrable so that the existence of the integrals
be guaranteed by Proposition 25.10.1. And, of course, for orthonormality to make
sense we shall also require that they be energy-limited. (The latter condition is
superﬂuous when they are bandlimited; see Note 6.4.12.)

Deﬁnition 25.15.3 (Projecting a Stochastic Process). If X is a measurable WSS
SP, and if φ1, . . . , φd ∈L1 ∩L2 are orthonormal, then the projection of X onto
span(φ1, . . . , φd) is the SP
(ω, t) 	→
d

ℓ=1
⟨X, φℓ⟩(ω) φℓ(t),
which we write more succinctly as
d

ℓ=1
⟨X, φℓ⟩φℓ.
(25.131)
We refer to
X −
d

ℓ=1
⟨X, φℓ⟩φℓ
(25.132)
as the part of X that is orthogonal to span(φ1, . . . , φd).
Note 25.15.4. If ˜φ1, . . . , ˜φd ∈L1 ∩L2 are orthonormal and have the same linear
span as φ1, . . . , φd, then one can show using the “almost” linearity of stochastic
integration (Lemma 25.10.3) that outside a set of probability zero, the stochastic
processes d
ℓ=1⟨X, φℓ⟩φℓand d
ℓ=1⟨X, ˜φℓ⟩˜φℓare identical.
Hence there is no
harm in referring to (25.131) as “the” projection.
Note 25.15.5. Even if X is stationary, its projection onto span(φ1, . . . , φd) is
typically not stationary. Nor is its part that is orthogonal to span(φ1, . . . , φd).
The following result on the projection of WGN is of paramount importance in dig-
ital communications. It, and its restatement in Theorem 25.15.7, are fundamental
to the design of optimal receivers for communication in the presence of WGN.
Theorem 25.15.6 (Projecting White Gaussian Noise). Let N be WGN of double-
sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W, and let φ1, . . . , φd be orthonormal
integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz. Then
d

ℓ=1
⟨N, φℓ⟩φℓ

N −

Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
We need to show that for every n ∈N and epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R the random vectors

N1(t1), . . . , N1(tn)
T
and

N2(t1), . . . , N2(tn)

(25.134)
are independent Gaussian vectors. To that end, we ﬁrst note that the 2n-vector

N1(t1), . . . , N1(tn), N2(t1), . . . , N2(tn)
T
is Gaussian because its components are linear functionals of the Gaussian SP N
(Theorem 25.12.1). This establishes that the random vectors in (25.134) are Gaus-
sian (Corollary 23.6.5) and are, in fact, jointly Gaussian (Deﬁnition 23.7.1). It
also establishes that to prove their independence it suﬃces to prove that they are
uncorrelated (Proposition 23.7.3). To conclude the proof it thus remains to show
that
Cov

N1(tν), N2(tν′)

= 0,
ν, ν′ ∈{1, . . . , n}.
(25.135)
Since both N1(tν) and N2(tν′) are linear functionals of the centered SP N, they
are centered (Proposition 25.10.1), and their covariance is thus E[N1(tν) N2(tν′)].

properties of WGN (Proposition 25.15.2).
Theorem 25.15.6 has far-reaching consequences in digital communications. But
before we can reap its beneﬁts, we must restate it slightly diﬀerently. To motivate
the restatement, let us write N as the sum of its projection onto span(φ1, . . . , φd)
and the part of N that is orthogonal to span(φ1, . . . , φd):

In this representation, N is the sum of two independent stochastic processes,
each of which is computed from N: the ﬁrst is computed by projecting N onto
span(φ1, . . . , φd), and the second by computing the part of N that is orthogonal
to this projection. To get a sense of the implications of this decomposition, let
us imagine a simpler scenario where stochastic processes are replaced by random
variables and projections by functions. Thus, imagine that we are told that a RV
X is such that X = g(X) + h(X), with g(X) and h(X) being independent. (In
this cartoon X plays the role of N; the mapping g: R →R plays the role of the
projection; and h(X) plays the role of the part of N that is orthogonal to the
subspace.) We could then infer that if we generate U independently of g(X) ac-
cording to the distribution of h(X), then the sum g(X) + U would have the same
law as X. How could we generate such a U? One way would be to compute the
distribution of h(X) (from that of X) and to then generate U independently of X
(and hence also independently of g(X)) according to this distribution. But there
is another way: we could generate some X′ of the same law as X but independent
of it, and then set U to equal h(X′). Since X′ is independent of X, so is h(X′),
and, because X′ is of the same law as X, it follows that h(X′) has the same law as
h(X). Adopting this approach we could conclude that g(X) + h(X′) has the same
law as X whenever X′ is generated independently of X but with same law.
Going back to stochastic processes and our WGN, we would expect the same: if
N′ is generated independently of N but with the same FDDs, then
d

ℓ=1
⟨N, φℓ⟩φℓ+
	
N′ −
d

ℓ=1
⟨N′, φℓ⟩φℓ

should have the same FDDs as N. This is the restatement of the theorem that we
are after:
Theorem 25.15.7 (Simulating WGN of a Given Projection). Let the SP N be
WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W. Let the SP N′
be of the same law as N but independent of it. Let φ1, . . . , φd be orthonormal
integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz. Then the SP
d

ℓ=1
⟨N, φℓ⟩φℓ+ N′ −
d

ℓ=1
⟨N′, φℓ⟩φℓ
is a measurable SP of the same FDDs as N.
The heuristic argument we gave above nearly proves that this theorem follows
directly from Theorem 25.15.6.
Some of the missing subtle details are related
to the deﬁnition of independence for stochastic processes (Deﬁnition 25.2.3). For
example, it is prima facie not clear from this deﬁnition that linear functionals of
independent stochastic processes are independent random variables. (They are; see
Proposition 25.15.8 ahead.) And it is therefore not obvious that if N′ and N are
independent, then so are
d

⟨N, φℓ⟩φℓ
and
N′ −

Continuous-Time Stochastic Processes
(They are.) The rest of this subsection is dedicated to a rigorous proof of this
theorem.
We begin with the basic result on independent stochastic processes that we need
in order to prove Theorem 25.15.7. The proof is technical, and readers without
some background in Measure Theory should probably skip it.
Proposition 25.15.8 (Linear Functionals of Independent SPs are Independent).
Let

X(t)

and

Y (t)

be independent WSS measurable stochastic processes. Let
sx and sy be integrable functions, and let α1, . . . , αn, β1, . . . , βn and t1, . . . , tn be
real. Then
 ∞

X(t) sx(t) dt +
n

ν=1
ανX(tν)
and
 ∞
−∞
Y (t) sy(t) dt +
n

ν=1
βνY (tν)
are independent random variables.
More generally, a random vector whose components are such linear functionals of

X(t)

is independent of any random vector whose components are such linear
functionals of

Y (t)

.
Proof. This result is reminiscent of the result that if the random variables U
and V are independent then so are g(U) and h(V ) for any (Borel measurable)
functions g, h: R →R. Here things are a bit trickier because we are dealing with
stochastic processes, which are uncountable collections of random variables. The
proof therefore requires some Measure Theory.
The independence of the stochastic processes implies the independence of the σ-
algebras generated by their cylindrical sets (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 1, Section 4,
Theorem 4.2). By Proposition 25.10.1 (iii) the above linear functionals are mea-
surable with respect to the respective σ-algebras. The result now follows by noting
that if a RV U is measurable with respect to a σ-algebra Fu, if a RV V is measurable
with respect to a σ-algebra Fv, and if the σ-algebras Fu and Fv are independent,
then U and V are independent (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 4, Section 20).
Proof of Theorem 25.15.7. Denote the autocovariance function of N by KNN.
Since N′ has the same FDDs as N, its autocovariance function is also KNN. Denote
the projection of N onto span(φ1, . . . , φd) by N1,
N1 =
d

ℓ=1
⟨N, φℓ⟩φℓ,
(25.138)
and the part of N′ that is orthogonal to span(φ1, . . . , φd) by N′

2 = N′ −

⟨N′, φℓ⟩φℓ.
(25.139)
Because the FDDs of a centered stationary Gaussian SP are fully determined by its
autocovariance function (Proposition 25.5.1 (ii)), to prove the theorem it suﬃces
to establish that, like N, the SP N1 + N′
2 is a measurable Gaussian stochastic

process of autocovariance function KNN. We ﬁrst show that N1 + N′
2 is Gaussian,
by establishing that N1 and N′
2 are independent Gaussian stochastic processes,
i.e., by arguing that for every n ∈N and epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R the random vectors

N1(t1), . . . , N1(tn)
T
and

N ′
2(t1), . . . , N ′
2(tn)
T
(25.140)
are independent Gaussian vectors.
Indeed, independence follows from Proposi-
tion 25.15.8 (because the components of the ﬁrst vector are linear functionals of
N, whereas those of the second are linear functionals of N′), and Gaussianity fol-
lows from Theorem 25.12.1 (because the components of each of the vectors are
linear functionals of a Gaussian SP). Having established that N1 + N′
2 is a Gaus-
sian SP, it only remains to show that it is stationary with autocovariance function
KNN.
Denote N1 + N′
2 by ˜N. Since N1 and N′
2 are independent and centered, it follows
that for all t, τ ∈R

Here the ﬁrst term on the RHS of (25.143) is computed using the deﬁnition of
the autocovariance function (Deﬁnition 25.4.4), and the second term is computed
as in (25.142) but with N replaced by N′. The last two terms in (25.144) are
computed using Proposition 25.15.2 (v).
It follows from (25.141), (25.142), and (25.145) that the autocovariance function
of ˜N is identical to that of N.
25.15.3
Other Deﬁnitions
As we noted earlier, our deﬁnition of WGN is diﬀerent from the one given in most
textbooks on Digital Communications. The key diﬀerence is that we deﬁne white-
ness with respect to a certain bandwidth W, whereas most textbooks do not add this
qualiﬁer. Thus, while we require that the PSD SNN(f) be equal to N0/2 only for
frequencies f satisfying |f| ≤W (leaving SNN(f) unspeciﬁed at other frequencies),
other textbooks require that SNN(f) be equal to N0/2 for all frequencies f ∈R.
With our deﬁnition of WGN we can only prove that (25.128) holds for integrable
signals that are bandlimited to W Hz, whereas with the other textbooks’ deﬁnition
one could presumably derive this relationship for all integrable functions.
We prefer our deﬁnition because there does not exist a Gaussian SP

N(t)

whose
PSD is equal to N0/2 at all frequencies. Indeed, the function of frequency that is
equal to N0/2 at all frequencies is not integrable and therefore does not qualify
as a PSD (Deﬁnition 25.7.2). Were such a PSD to exist, we would obtain from
(25.31) that such a process would have inﬁnite variance and thus be neither WSS
(Deﬁnition 25.4.2) nor Gaussian (Note 25.3.2).
Requiring that (25.128) hold for all integrable (continuous) signals would require
that KNN be given by the product of N0/2 and Dirac’s delta, which opens a whole
can of worms. Nevertheless, the reader should be aware that in some books WGN
is deﬁned as a centered, stationary Gaussian noise whose autocovariance function
is given by Dirac’s Delta scaled by N0/2 or, equivalently, whose PSD is equal to
N0/2 at all frequencies.

bandlimited to W Hz with the requirement that they be integrable functions that
are bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. Likewise for Theorems

Chapter 26
Detection in White Gaussian Noise
26.1
Introduction
In this chapter we ﬁnally address the detection problem in continuous time. The
setup is described in Section 26.2. The key result of this chapter is that—although
the observation in this setup is a stochastic process, i.e., a continuum of ran-
dom variables—the problem can be reduced without loss of optimality to a ﬁnite-
dimensional problem where the observation is a random vector.
This result is
presented in Section 26.3. In Section 26.4 we analyze the conditional law of the
random vector under each of the hypotheses.
This analysis enables us in Sec-
tion 26.5 to derive an optimal guessing rule and in Section 26.6 to analyze its
performance. Section 26.7 addresses the front-end ﬁlter, which is a critical element
of any practical implementation of the decision rule. Extensions to passband detec-
tion are then described in Section 26.8, followed by some examples in Section 26.9.
Section 26.10 treats the problem of detection in “colored” noise, and Section 26.11
treats systems with multiple antennas. The chapter concludes with a discussion of
the detection problem for mean signals that are not bandlimited.
26.2
Setup
A discrete random variable M (“message”) takes values in the set M = {1, . . . , M},
where M ≥2, according to the a priori probabilities
πm = Pr[M = m],
m ∈M,
(26.1)
where π1, . . . , πM are positive1
πm > 0,
m ∈M
(26.2)
and sum to one

m∈M
πm = 1.
(26.3)
1There is no loss in generality in addressing the detection problem only for strictly positive
priors. Hypotheses that have a zero prior can be ignored at the receiver without loss in optimality.

26.3 From a Stochastic Process to a Random Vector
621
We observe a continuous-time SP

Y (t), t ∈R

, which, conditional on M = m,
can be expressed as
Y (t) = sm(t) + N(t),
t ∈R,
(26.4)
i.e.,
Y = sm + N,
(26.5)
where the “mean signals” s1, . . . , sM are real, deterministic, integrable signals that
are bandlimited to W Hz (Deﬁnition 6.4.9), and where the “noise”

N(t)

is inde-
pendent of M and is WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the band-
width W (Deﬁnition 25.15.1). Based on the observation

Y (t)

we wish to guess M
with the smallest possible probability of error.2
26.3
From a Stochastic Process to a Random Vector
The next theorem allows us to reduce the detection problem from one where the
observation is a SP to one where it is a random vector. The reduction is done
“without loss in optimality” in the sense that to every measurable decision rule
that is based on the SP there corresponds a (randomized) decision rule that is
based on the random vector and that is of identical performance: for every message
m ∈M, the conditional probabilities of error given M = m of the two decision
rules are identical and, consequently, so are the (unconditional) probabilities of
error, because
p(error) =

m∈M
πm p(error|M = m).
(26.6)
Before stating this key result we recall that the linear subspace span(s1, . . . , sM)
is the collection of all linear combinations of the mean signals s1, . . . , sM (Sec-
tion 4.3); that this subspace is ﬁnite dimensional; that its elements are all inte-
grable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz (because s1, . . . , sM are); and that
it has an orthonormal basis (Deﬁnition 4.6.3, Note 6.4.12, Note 6.4.2, and Propo-
sition 4.6.10). Such an orthonormal basis can be found using the Gram-Schmidt
Procedure (Section 4.6.6). If (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal basis for the subspace
span(s1, . . . , sM), then this subspace is of dimension d; by Proposition 4.6.4
sm =
d

ℓ=1
⟨sm, φℓ⟩φℓ,
m ∈M;
(26.7)
and, by Proposition 4.6.9,
∥sm∥2
2 =
d

ℓ=1
⟨sm, φℓ⟩2,
m ∈M.
(26.8)
2In mathematical terms we are looking for a mapping from Ω to M that is measurable with
respect to the σ-algebra generated by

Y (t)

and that minimizes the probability of error among
all such functions.

622
Detection in White Gaussian Noise
Theorem 26.3.1 (From a SP to a Random Vector). Consider the setup of Sec-
tion 26.2.
(i) If (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal basis for span(s1, . . . , sM), then to every
decision rule based on Y that is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra
generated by Y there corresponds a randomized decision rule based on the
random d-vector

⟨Y, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨Y, φd⟩
T
(26.9)
of identical performance in the sense that the conditional probabilities of error
given M of the two rules are identical. Consequently, no measurable decision
rule for guessing M based on Y can have a probability of error that is smaller
than that of an optimal rule for guessing M based on the random vector
(26.9).
(ii) If ˜s1, . . . ,˜sn are integrable signals satisfying
span(s1, . . . , sM) ⊆span(˜s1, . . . ,˜sn),
(26.10)
then, in the above sense, it is optimal to guess M based on

⟨Y,˜s1⟩, . . . , ⟨Y,˜sn⟩
T.
(26.11)
(iii) In the above sense there is also no loss of optimality in guessing M based on

⟨Y, s1⟩, . . . , ⟨Y, sM⟩
T.
(26.12)
Proof. The main result of the theorem is Part (i), with which we begin. The other
parts are simple corollaries. We begin with a technicality. Since the mean signals
s1, . . . , sM are integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz, it follows that so
are all the signals in span(s1, . . . , sM), including φ1, . . . , φd. Consequently, the
stochastic integrals in (26.9) are well-deﬁned.
Having gotten this out of the way, we now proceed to the main part of the proof,
which is illustrated in Figure 26.1 on Page 623. At the top of the ﬁgure is some
arbitrary given (measurable) decision rule φGuess that produces the guess φGuess(Y)
based on the observed SP Y. We next construct a randomized decision rule of
identical performance but that is based on the vector of inner products (26.9). The
randomized rule ﬁrst uses its local randomness and the vector of inner products
to produce a new continuous-time SP Y′, and it then feeds Y′ to the given rule
φGuess to produce the guess φGuess(Y′). The SP Y′ is constructed so that, for
every m ∈M, its conditional law given M = m be identical to the conditional law
of Y given M = m. Consequently,
Pr

φGuess(Y) ̸= m
 M = m

= Pr

φGuess(Y′) ̸= m
 M = m

,
m ∈M, (26.13)
with the result that the two rules have identical performance. It remains to con-
struct Y′ and to demonstrate that its conditional law is identical to the conditional
law of Y.

consequently, so are the conditional probabilities of error.

Detection in White Gaussian Noise
The construction of Y′ is depicted at the bottom of Figure 26.1.
We use the
local randomness to produce a measurable SP N′ whose law is identical to that
of the noise N. Thus, N′ is a measurable, centered, stationary, Gaussian SP of
autocovariance function KNN—the autocovariance function of the WGN on the
channel. The SP Y′ is
Y′ =
d

ℓ=1
⟨Y, φℓ⟩φℓ+ N′ −
d

ℓ=1
⟨N′, φℓ⟩φℓ.
(26.14)
The ﬁrst summand, which is based on the inner products, reconstructs the projec-
tion of Y onto span(φ1, . . . , φd)—the linear subspace spanned by the mean signals.
The sum of the remaining terms is of the same law as the part of N that is or-
thogonal to span(φ1, . . . , φd) but, of course, independent of it. (It was generated
from N′, which was generated from the local randomness, which is independent
of N.)
We next verify that, conditional on M = m, the stochastic processes Y and Y′ have
identical laws (FDDs) for every m ∈M. We begin by verifying that the conditional
means are identical. It is here that we use the hypothesis that (φ1, . . . , φd) is an
orthonormal basis for span(s1, . . . , sM):

ℓ=1
⟨sm, φℓ⟩φℓ

Here the ﬁrst equality holds because N′ is centered; the second because, conditional
on M = m, the received waveform Y is sm+N; the third by writing ⟨sm + N, φℓ⟩as
⟨sm, φℓ⟩+⟨N, φℓ⟩and by noting that ⟨N, φℓ⟩is of zero mean because N is centered;
and the last equality follows from (26.7), which holds because (φ1, . . . , φd) is an
orthonormal basis for span(s1, . . . , sM).
If we subtract the conditional mean from Y, we obtain N, whereas if we subtract
the conditional mean from Y′ we obtain
d

ℓ=1
⟨N, φℓ⟩φℓ+ N′ −
d

ℓ=1
⟨N′, φℓ⟩φℓ.
The two have the same conditional laws given M = m by Theorem 25.15.7.
We next prove Part (ii) by showing that (26.10) implies that, if φ1, . . . , φd are
as above, then from the inner-products vector (26.11) we can compute the inner-
products vector (26.9). To see this we note that since φ1, . . . , φd is an orthonormal
basis for span(s1, . . . , sM),
φℓ∈span(s1, . . . , sM),
ℓ∈{1, . . . , d},
(26.15)

625
and hence, by the assumption (26.10),
φℓ∈span(˜s1, . . . ,˜sn),
ℓ∈{1, . . . , d}.
(26.16)
Consequently, for each such ℓthere exist n constants α(1)
ℓ, . . . , α(n)
ℓ
∈R such that
φℓ=

(26.17)
This and the “almost” linearity of stochastic integration (Lemma 25.10.3) implies
that with probability one
⟨Y, φℓ⟩=
n

j=1
α(j)
ℓ
⟨Y,˜sj⟩,
ℓ∈{1, . . . , d},
(26.18)
and the inner-products vector (26.9) is indeed computable from the inner-products
vector (26.11).
Part (iii) follows from Part (ii) by substituting M for n and s1, . . . , sM for ˜s1, . . . ,˜sn.
The fact that there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess of M on the vector of
inner products (26.9) has a beautiful geometric interpretation. In order to present
it, we ﬁrst note that there is a one-to-one relationship between the inner-products
vector and the projection
d

ℓ=1
⟨Y, φℓ⟩φℓ
(26.19)
of the received SP Y onto the subspace spanned by the mean vectors (Deﬁni-
tion 25.15.3).
Indeed, we can compute this projection from the inner-products
vector using (26.19), and from this projection we can compute the inner-products
vector via the relation
⟨Y, φℓ⟩=
L
d

ℓ′=1
⟨Y, φℓ′⟩φℓ′, φℓ
M
,
ℓ∈{1, . . . , d}.
(26.20)
By Theorem 26.3.1 (i), it is optimal to guess M based on the inner-products vector,
and since this vector is computable from the projection of the received SP onto
the linear subspace spanned by the mean signals, we conclude that it is optimal
to guess M based on this projection. This is one of the most important results in
Digital Communications, so we repeat:
When guessing which of M integrable signals that are bandlimited
to W Hz is being observed in Gaussian noise that is white with
respect to the bandwidth W, there is no loss of optimality in basing
the guess on the projection of the observed waveform onto the
linear subspace spanned by the signals.

hypotheses. Obtaining these conditional laws is, fortunately, straightforward:

Figure 26.2: Computing the inner products ⟨Y, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨Y, φd⟩from the received
waveform using d matched ﬁlters and feeding the result to a guessing device.
Proof. We shall only prove Part (ii); the other parts are special cases. Conditional
on M = m, the SP Y is sm + N, and the inner-products vector in (26.22a) is thus

⟨sm,˜s1⟩, . . . , ⟨sm,˜sn⟩
T +

⟨N,˜s1⟩, . . . , ⟨N,˜sn⟩
T.
(26.24)
Here the ﬁrst vector is deterministic, and the second is a centered Gaussian because
its components are linear functionals of WGN (Proposition 25.15.2 (ii)).
This
establishes that the vector is Gaussian (Proposition 23.6.3). Since the second vector
is centered, the mean vector equals the ﬁrst vector, i.e., is as given in (26.22b).
It remains to compute the covariance matrix, which is the covariance matrix of

⟨N,˜s1⟩, . . . , ⟨N,˜sn⟩
T.
This matrix is the one in (26.22c) by Proposition 25.15.2 (ii) on linear functionals
of WGN.
Theorems 26.3.1 and 26.4.1 suggest two diﬀerent (equivalent) receiver architec-
tures: the one depicted in Figure 26.2, where the inner-products vector (26.21a) is
computed using d matched ﬁlters, and the result is then fed to a guessing device,
and the one depicted in Figure 26.3 where we ﬁrst compute the M inner products
between Y and each of the mean signals and we then feed the result to a (diﬀerent)
decision device.
For the purpose of deriving an optimal decision rule, it is usually easier to adopt the
ﬁrst architecture and to work with the inner-products vector (26.21a), because its
conditional law is so simple. Moreover, this architecture requires only d matched
ﬁlters, and d ≤M. In contrast, the vector (26.23a) can be cumbersome because its
covariance matrix may be singular, so it need not have a density. Nevertheless, it
does have the advantage that it is “coordinate free,” in the sense that its deﬁnition
does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis. This makes some of the
results more transparent. With an eye to this, we note the following immediate
consequence of Theorem 26.4.1 (iii):

The PSD of the noise at frequencies outside the band [−W, W ] is immaterial.
26.4.2
It Is all in the Geometry!
By Theorem 26.3.1 (iii), the performance of the best decision rule based on Y is the
same as the performance of the best rule based on the inner-products vector (26.25).
The performance of the latter is determined by the prior and by the conditional
laws of the vector given the diﬀerent messages. By Note 26.4.2, these conditional
laws are determined by the PSD N0/2 of the noise in the band [−W, W ] and
by the pairwise inner products between the mean signals (26.26). Other than in
determining these inner products, the nature of the mean signals is immaterial
(provided that they are integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz). The
PSD of the noise outside the band [−W, W ] is also immaterial. We thus conclude:
Proposition 26.4.3. For the setup of Section 26.2, the minimal probability of error
that can be achieved in guessing M based on


is determined by N0, the inner
products (26.26), and the prior {πm}m∈M.

It follows from Theorem 26.4.1 (i) that for every m ∈M the conditional distribu-

and covariance matrix (N0/2) Id, where Id denotes the d × d identity matrix. The
components of T are thus conditionally independent and of equal variance N0/2
(but not of equal mean). Consequently, we can express the conditional density
of T, conditional on M = m, at every point t = (t(1), . . . , t(d))T ∈Rd using
this conditional independence and the explicit form of the univariate Gaussian
density (19.6) as

Note that with proper translation (Table 26.1, Page 630) the conditional distri-
bution of T is very similar to the one we addressed in Section 21.6; see (21.51).
In fact, it is a special case of the distribution studied in Section 21.6: Y there
corresponds to T here; J there corresponds to d here; σ2 there corresponds to N0/2
here; and the mean vector sm associated with Message m there corresponds to the

Note that, because (φ1, . . . , φd) is an orthonormal basis for span(s1, . . . , sM), the
signals sm′ and sm′′ diﬀer, if, and only if, the vectors (⟨sm′, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨sm′, φd⟩)T

The Decision Rule without Reference to a Basis
We next derive a “coordinate-free” representation of our decision rule, i.e., a rep-

Since the term

and likewise for ˜m. Here the ﬁrst equality follows by linearity (Lemma 25.10.3)
and the second by substituting m′ for m in (26.7).
Part (ii) follows by noting that if M is uniform, then ln πm′ does not depend on
the hypothesis m′.
Part (iii) follows from Part (ii) because if all the mean signals are of equal energy,
then the term

Performance Analysis
The decision rule we derived in Section 26.5.1 uses the observed SP

Y (t)

to
compute the vector T of inner products with an orthonormal basis (φ1, . . . , φd)
via (26.28), with the result that the vector T has the conditional law speciﬁed
in (26.30).
Our decision rule then performs MAP decoding of M based on T.
Consequently, the performance of our decoding rule is identical to the performance
of the MAP rule for guessing M based on a vector T having the conditional law
(26.30). The performance of this latter decoding rule was studied in Section 21.6.
All that remains is to translate the results from that section in order to obtain
performance bounds on our decoder.

26.6 Performance Analysis
633
To translate the results from Section 21.6 we need to substitute N0/2 for σ2 there;
d for J there; and (26.31) for the mean vectors there (see Table 26.1). But there is
one more translation we need: the bounds in Section 21.6 are expressed in terms
of the Euclidean distance between the mean vectors, and here we prefer to express
the bounds in terms of the “distance” between the mean signals.
Fortunately,
as we next show, the translation is straightforward. Because (φ1, . . . , φd) is an
orthonormal basis for span(s1, . . . , sM), it follows from Proposition 4.6.9 that
d

ℓ=1
⟨v, φℓ⟩2 = ∥v∥2
2 ,
v ∈span(s1, . . . , sM).
(26.40)
Substituting sm′ −sm′′ for v and hence ⟨sm′, φℓ⟩−⟨sm′′, φℓ⟩for ⟨v, φℓ⟩in this
identity yields

(26.42)
Thus, the squared Euclidean distance between two mean vectors in Section 21.6
is equal to the energy in the diﬀerence between the corresponding mean signals in
our setup.
Denoting by pMAP(error|M = m) the conditional probability of error of our decoder
conditional on M = m, and denoting by p∗(error) its unconditional probability of
error (which is the optimal probability of error)
p∗(error) =

26.7
The Front-End Filter
Receivers in practice rarely have the structure depicted in Figure 26.3 because—
although mathematically optimal—its hardware implementation is challenging.
The diﬃculty is related to the “dynamic range” problem in implementing the
matched ﬁlter: it is very diﬃcult to design a perfectly-linear system to exact speciﬁ-
cation. Linearity is usually only guaranteed for a certain range of input amplitudes.
Once the amplitude of the signal exceeds a certain level, the circuit often “clips”
the input waveform and no longer behaves linearly. Similarly, input signals that
are too small might be below the sensitivity of the circuit and might therefore
produce no output, thus violating linearity. This is certainly the case with circuits
that employ analog-to-digital conversion followed by digital processing, because
analog-to-digital converters can only represent the input with ﬁnite precision. The
problem with the structure depicted in Figure 26.3 is that the noise

N(t)

is typ-
ically much larger than the mean signal, so it becomes very diﬃcult to design a
circuit to exact speciﬁcations that will be linear enough to guarantee that its action
on the received waveform (consisting of the weak transmitted waveform and the
strong additive noise) be the sum of the required responses to the mean signal and
to the noise-signal. (That the noise is typically much larger than the mean signals
can be seen from the heuristic plot of its PSD in Figure 25.3. White Gaussian
noise is often of PSD N0/2 over frequency bands that are much larger than the
band [−W, W ] so, by (25.31), the variance of the noise can be extremely large.)
The engineering solution to the dynamic range problem is to pass the received
waveform through a “front-end ﬁlter” and to then feed this ﬁlter’s output to the
matched ﬁlter as in Figure 26.4. Except for a few very stringent requirements,
the speciﬁcations of the front-end ﬁlter are relatively lax. The ﬁrst requirement
is that the ﬁlter be linear over a very large range of input levels. This is usually
accomplished by using only passive elements in its implementation. The second

requirement is that the front-end ﬁlter’s frequency response be of unit gain over
the mean signals’ frequency band [−W, W ] so that it will not distort the mean
signals.4 Additionally, we require that the ﬁlter be stable and that its frequency
response decay to zero sharply for frequencies outside the band [−W, W ]. This
latter condition guarantees that the ﬁlter’s response to the noise be of small variance
so that the dynamic range of the signal at the ﬁlter’s output be moderate. If we
denote the front-end ﬁlter’s impulse response by hFE, then the key mathematical
requirements are linearity; stability, i.e.,

Detection in White Gaussian Noise
In the rest of this section we shall prove that, as long as these assumptions are met,
there is no loss of optimality in introducing the front-end ﬁlter as in Figure 26.4.
(In the ideal mathematical world there is, of course, nothing to be gained from this
ﬁlter, because the architecture depicted in Figure 26.3 is optimal.)
The crux of the proof is in showing that—like

Y (t)

—the front-end ﬁlter’s output
is the sum of the transmitted signal and WGN of PSD N0/2 with respect to the
bandwidth W. Once this is established, the result follows by recalling that the
conditional joint distribution of the matched ﬁlters’ outputs does not depend on
the PSD of the noise outside the band [−W, W ] (Note 26.4.2).
We thus proceed to analyze the front-end ﬁlter’s output, which we denote by
 ˜Y (t)

:
 ˜Y (t)

=

Y (t)

⋆hFE.
(26.54)
We ﬁrst note that (26.53) and the assumption that sm is an integrable signal that
is bandlimited to W Hz guarantee that
sm ⋆hFE = sm,
m ∈M
(26.55)
(Proposition 6.5.2 and Proposition 6.4.10 cf. (b)). By (26.55) and by the linearity
of the ﬁlter we can thus express the ﬁlter’s output (conditional on M = m) as
 ˜Y (t)

=

Y (t)

⋆hFE
= sm ⋆hFE +

N(t)

⋆hFE
= sm +

N(t)

⋆hFE.
(26.56)
We next show that the SP

N(t)

⋆hFE on the RHS of (26.56) is WGN of PSD N0/2
with respect to the bandwidth W. This follows from Theorem 25.13.2. Indeed,
being the result of passing a measurable centered stationary Gaussian SP through
a stable ﬁlter, it is a measurable centered stationary Gaussian SP. And its PSD is
f 	→SNN(f)
ˆhFE(f)
2,
(26.57)
which is equal to N0/2 for all frequencies f ∈[−W, W ], because for these frequen-
cies SNN(f) is equal to N0/2 and ˆhFE(f) is equal to one. At frequencies outside
the band [−W, W ] the PSD of

N(t)

⋆hFE may diﬀer from that of

N(t)

.
We thus conclude that the front-end ﬁlter’s output, like its input, can be expressed
as the transmitted signal corrupted by WGN of PSD N0/2 with respect to the
bandwidth W. Note 26.4.2 now guarantees that for every m ∈M we have that,
conditional on M = m, the distribution of
	 ∞
−∞
˜Y (t) s1(t) dt, . . . ,
 ∞
−∞
˜Y (t) sM(t) dt

T
is identical to the conditional distribution of the random vector in (26.12).
The advantage of the front-end ﬁlter becomes apparent when we re-examine the
PSD of the noise at its output. If the front-end ﬁlter’s frequency response decays
very sharply to zero for frequencies outside the band [−W, W ], then, by (26.57),
.028
14:52:52, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at

26.8 Detection in Passband
637
this PSD will be nearly zero outside this band. Consequently, the variance of the
noise at the front-end ﬁlter’s output—which is the integral of this PSD—will be
greatly reduced. This will guarantee that the dynamic range at the ﬁlter’s output
be much smaller than at its input, thus simplifying the implementation of the
matched ﬁlters.
26.8
Detection in Passband
The detection problem in passband is very similar to the one in baseband. The
diﬀerence is that the mean signals {sm} are now assumed to be integrable signals
that are bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc (Deﬁnition 7.2.1)
and that the noise is now assumed to be WGN of PSD N0/2 with respect to the
bandwidth W around fc (Deﬁnition 25.15.9).
Here too, there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on the vector

⟨Y,˜s1⟩, . . . , ⟨Y,˜sn⟩
T
(26.58)
whenever the signals ˜s1, . . . ,˜sn are integrable signals that are bandlimited to W
Hz around fc and satisfy
sm ∈span(˜s1, . . . ,˜sn),
m ∈M.
Conditional on M = m, this vector is Gaussian with mean vector (26.22b) and
covariance matrix (26.22c). The latter covariance matrix can also be written in
terms of the baseband representation of the mean signals using the relation
⟨˜sj′,˜sj′′⟩= 2 Re

⟨˜sj′,BB,˜sj′′,BB⟩

,
(26.59)
where ˜sj′,BB and ˜sj′′,BB are the baseband representations of ˜sj′ and ˜sj′′ (Theo-
rem 7.6.10).
The computation of the inner products (26.11) can be performed in passband
by feeding the signal Y directly to ﬁlters that are matched to the passband sig-
nals {˜sj}, or in baseband by expressing the inner product ⟨Y,˜sj⟩in terms of the
baseband representation ˜sj,BB of ˜sj as follows:

of

and cos(2πfct), and one that is matched to Im(˜sj,BB) and that is fed the

(26.60)
with the frequency response decaying drastically at other frequencies to guarantee
that the ﬁlter’s output be of small dynamic range. Moreover, we typically prefer to
use matched ﬁlters that do not depend on the carrier frequency in order to allow
it to be tunable. This issue is discussed in greater detail in Section 32.5.

We observe the SP

given by the sum of the transmitted signal and WGN
of PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W, and we wish to guess which signal
was sent. How should we form our guess?
By Theorem 26.3.1 there is no loss of optimality in forming our guess based on
the RV T = ⟨Y, φ⟩. Conditional on H = 0, we have T ∼N


, whereas,
conditional on H = 1, we have T ∼N

−√Es, N0/2

. How to guess H based on T
is the problem we addressed in Section 20.10. There we showed that it is optimal
to guess “H = 0” if T ≥0 and to guess “H = 1” if T < 0. (The case T = 0 occurs
with probability zero, so we need not worry about it.) An optimal decision rule for
guessing H based on

is thus:

W Hz around the carrier frequency fc is integrable (Proposition 7.6.2), it follows that our as-

Let pMAP(error|s) denote the conditional probability of error of this decision rule
given that s was sent; let pMAP(error|−s) be similarly deﬁned; and let p∗(error)
denote the optimal probability of error of this problem. By the optimality of our
rule,
p∗(error) = 1

(26.65)
which, in view of (26.62), can also be written as

(26.66)
Note that, as expected from Section 26.4.2 and in particular from Proposition 26.4.3,
the probability of error is determined by the “geometry” of the problem, which in
this case is summarized by the energy in s.
There is also a nice geometric interpretation to (26.66). The distance between the
mean signals s and −s is ∥s −(−s)∥2 = 2√Es. Half the distance is √Es. The
inner product between the noise and the unit-length vector φ pointing from −s
to s is N(0, N0/2). Half the distance thus corresponds to √Es/

N0/2 standard
deviations of this inner product. The probability of error is thus the probability
that a standard Gaussian is greater than half the distance between the signals as
measured by standard deviations of the inner product between the noise and the
unit-length vector pointing from −s towards s.
Consider now the more general binary hypothesis testing problem where both hy-
potheses are still equally likely, but where the mean signals s0 and s1 are not
antipodal, i.e., they do not sum to zero. Our approach to this problem is to reduce
it to the antipodal case we already treated. We begin by forming the signal
 ˜Y (t)

by subtracting (s0 + s1)/2 from the received signal, so
˜Y (t) = Y (t) −1
2

s0(t) + s1(t)

,
t ∈R.
(26.67)
Since Y (t) can be recovered from ˜Y (t) by adding

s0(t) + s1(t)

/2, the smallest
probability of a guessing error that can be achieved based on
 ˜Y (t)

is no larger
than that which can be achieved based on

Y (t)

. (The two are, in fact, the same
because
 ˜Y (t)

can be computed from

Y (t)

.)
The advantage of using
 ˜Y (t)

becomes apparent once we compute its conditional
law given H. Conditional on H = 0, we have ˜Y (t) = (s0(t) −s1(t))/2 + N(t),
whereas conditional on H = 1, we have ˜Y (t) = −(s0(t)−s1(t))/2+N(t). Thus, the
guessing problem given
 ˜Y (t)

is exactly the problem we addressed in the antipodal
case with (s0 −s1)/2 playing the role of s. We thus obtain that an optimal decision

The error probability associated with this decision rule is obtained from (26.65) by
substituting (s0 −s1)/2 for s:
p∗(error) = Q

⎠.
(26.69)
This expression too has a nice geometric interpretation. The inner product between
the noise and the unit-norm signal that is pointing from s1 to s0 is N(0, N0/2). The
“distance” between the signals is ∥s0 −s1∥2. Half the distance is ∥s0 −s1∥2 /2,
which corresponds to
∥s0 −s1∥2 /2

N0/2
standard deviations of a N(0, N0/2) random variable. The probability of error
(26.69) is thus the probability that the inner product between the noise and the
unit-norm signal that is pointing from s1 to s0 exceeds half the distance between
the signals.

8-PSK
We next present an example of detection in passband. For concreteness we consider
8-PSK, which stands for “8-ary Phase Shift Keying.” Here the number of hypothe-
ses is eight, so M = {1, 2, . . . , 8} and M = 8. We assume that M is uniformly
distributed over M. Conditional on M = m, the received signal is given by
Y (t) = sm(t) + N(t),

as can be veriﬁed using the relationship between energy in passband and baseband
(Theorem 7.6.10) and using (26.73).
The transmitted waveform sm can also be written in a form that is highly suggestive

From Theorem 7.6.10 on inner products in passband and baseband, it follows that
φ1 and φ2 are orthogonal. Also, from that theorem and from (26.73), it follows
that they are of unit energy. Thus, the tuple (φ1, φ2) is an orthonormal basis for
span(s1, . . . , sM). Consequently, there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess
on the random vector T = (⟨Y, φ1⟩, ⟨Y, φ2⟩)T, and conditional on M = m, the
components of T are independent with T (1) ∼N

and with
T (2) ∼N
√

. We have thus reduced the guessing problem to
that of guessing M based on a two-dimensional vector T.
The problem of guessing M based on T was studied in Section 21.4. To lift the
results from that section, we need to substitute
√
2α for A and to substitute N0/2
for σ2. For example, the region where we guess “M = 1” is given in Figure 26.6.
For the scenario we described, some engineers prefer to use complex random vari-
ables (Chapter 17).
Rather than viewing T as a two-dimensional real random
vector, they prefer to view it as a (scalar) complex random variable whose real
part is ⟨Y, φ1⟩and whose imaginary part is ⟨Y, φ2⟩. Conditional on M = m, this
CRV has the form

2cm + Z,
Z ∼NC(0, N0) ,

Detection in White Gaussian Noise
where NC(0, N0) denotes the circularly-symmetric variance-N0 complex Gaussian
distribution (Note 24.3.13).
The expression for the probability of error of our detector can also be lifted from
Section 21.4.
Substituting, as above,
√
2α for A and N0/2 for σ2, we obtain
from (21.26) that the conditional probability of error pMAP(error|M = m) of our
proposed decision rule is given for every m ∈M by

The conditional probability of error can also be expressed in terms of the trans-
mitted energy Es using (26.74).
Doing that and recalling that the conditional
probability of error does not depend on the transmitted message, we obtain that

Note 26.9.1. The expression (26.76) continues to hold also for M-PSK where
cm = α ei2πm/M for M ≥2 not necessarily equal to 8, provided that we deﬁne
ψ = π/M in (26.76).
26.9.3
Orthogonal Keying
We next consider M-ary orthogonal keying. We assume that the RV M that we
wish to guess is uniformly distributed over the set M = {1, . . . , M}, where M ≥2.
The mean signals are assumed to be orthogonal and of equal (strictly) positive
energy Es:
⟨sm′, sm′′⟩= Es I{m′ = m′′},
m′, m′′ ∈M.
(26.77)
Since M is uniform, and since the mean signals are of equal energy, it follows
from Theorem 26.5.3 that to minimize the probability of guessing incorrectly, it is
optimal to correlate the received waveform

Y (t)

with each of the mean signals
and to pick the message whose mean signal gives the highest correlation:
Guess “m” if ⟨Y, sm⟩= max
m′∈M ⟨Y, sm′⟩
(26.78)
with ties (which occur with probability zero) being resolved by picking a random
message among those that attain the highest correlation.
We next address the probability of error of this optimal decision rule. We ﬁrst
deﬁne the vector (T (1), . . . , T (M))T by
T (ℓ) =
 ∞
−∞
Y (t) sℓ(t)

ℓ∈{1, . . . , M}
and recast the decision rule as guessing “M = m” if T (m) = maxm′∈M T (m′), with
ties being resolved at random among the components of T that are maximal.

26.9 Some Examples
643
Let pMAP(error|M = m) denote the conditional probability of error of this decoding
rule, conditional on M = m. Conditional on M = m, an error occurs in two cases:
when m does not attain the highest score or when m attains the highest score but
this score is also attained by some other message and the tie is not resolved in m’s
favor. Since the probability of a tie is zero (Note 26.5.4), we may ignore the second
case and only compute the probability that an incorrect message is assigned a score
that is (strictly) higher than the one associated with m. Thus,
pMAP(error|M = m)
= Pr

T (1), . . . , T (m−1), T (m+1), . . . , T (M)

(26.79)
From (26.30) and the orthogonality of the signals (26.77) we have that, condi-
tional on M = m, the random vector T is Gaussian with the mean of its m-th
component being √Es, the mean of its other components being zero, and with all
the components being of variance N0/2 and independent of each other. Thus, the
conditional probability of error given M = m is “the probability that at least one
of M −1 IID N(0, N0/2) random variables exceeds the value of a N
√Es, N0/2

random variable that is independent of them.” Having recast the probability of
error conditional on M = m in a way that does not involve m (the clause in quotes
makes no reference to m), we conclude that the conditional probability of error
given that M = m does not depend on m:
pMAP(error|M = m) = pMAP(error|M = 1),
m ∈M.

The M-ary Simplex
We next describe a detection problem that is intimately related to the problem we
addressed in Section 26.9.3. To motivate the problem we ﬁrst note:
Proposition 26.9.2. Consider the setup described in Section 26.2.
If s is any
integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then the probability of error associated
with the mean signals {s1, . . . , sM} and the prior {πm} is the same as with the mean
signals {s1 −s, . . . , sM −s} and the same prior.

Detection in White Gaussian Noise
Proof. We have essentially given a proof of this result in Section 14.3 and also
in Section 26.9.1 in our analysis of nonantipodal signaling. The idea is that, by
subtracting the signal s from the received waveform, the receiver can make the
problem with mean signals {s1, . . . , sM} appear as though it were the problem
with mean signals {s1 −s, . . . , sM −s}.
Conversely, by adding s, the receiver
can make the latter appear as though it were the former. Consequently, the best
performance achievable in the two settings must be identical.
The expected transmitted energy when employing the mean signals {s1, . . . , sM}
may be diﬀerent than when employing the mean signals {s1 −s, . . . , sM −s}. In
subtracting the signal s one can change the average transmitted energy for better
or worse. As we argued in Section 14.4, to minimize the expected transmitted
energy, one should choose s to correspond to the “center of gravity” of the mean
signals:
Proposition 26.9.3. Let the prior {πm} and mean signals {sm} be given. Let
s∗=

Then, for any energy-limited signal s

The decision rule for the simplex constellation can also be derived by exploiting the
relationship to orthogonal keying. For example, if ψ is a unit-energy integrable sig-

tion of the process of obtaining an orthogonal constellation with M = 2 signals by
adding a signal ψ to each of the signals in a binary simplex constellation.) Conse-
quently, in order to decode the simplex signals contaminated by WGN with respect
to the bandwidth W, we can add

√Es ψ to the received waveform and then
feed the result to an optimal detector for orthogonal keying.

Bi-Orthogonal Keying
Starting with an orthogonal constellation, we can double the number of signals
without reducing the minimum distance. This construction, which results in the
“bi-orthogonal signal set” is the topic of this section. To construct the bi-orthogonal
signal set with 2κ signals, we start with κ ≥1 orthonormal signals (φ1, . . . , φκ)
and deﬁne the 2κ bi-orthogonal signal set {s1,u, s1,d, . . . , sκ,u, sκ,d} by

“up signal” that corresponds to multiplying √Esφν by +1 and the “down signal”
that corresponds to multiplying √Esφν by −1. Only bi-orthogonal signal sets with

Since the signal was chosen equiprobably, and since all the signals in the signal set
are of the same energy, it is optimal to consider the inner products
⟨Y, s1,u⟩, ⟨Y, s1,d⟩, . . . , ⟨Y, sκ,u⟩, ⟨Y, sκ,d⟩
(26.100)
and to pick the signal in the signal set corresponding to the largest of these in-
ner products. By (26.98) we have for every ν ∈{1, . . . , κ} that sν,u = −sν,d so
⟨Y, sν,u⟩= −⟨Y, sν,d⟩and hence

To ﬁnd the maximum of the 2κ terms in (26.100) we can ﬁrst compute for each

and then, after you have found ν∗, guess “sν∗,u” if ⟨Y, φν∗⟩> 0 and guess “sν∗,d”
if ⟨Y, φν∗⟩≤0.
We next compute the probability of error of this optimal guessing rule. It is not
diﬃcult to see that the conditional probability of error does not depend on the
message we condition on. For concreteness, we shall analyze the probability of
error associated with the message corresponding to the signal s1,u, a probability
that we denote by pMAP(error|s1,u), with the corresponding conditional probability
of correct decoding pMAP(correct|s1,u) = 1 −pMAP(error|s1,u).
To simplify the
typesetting, we shall denote the conditional probability of the event A given that
s1,u is sent by Pr(A|s1,u).

with the following justiﬁcation. The ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of
our optimal decoder and from the fact that ties occur with probability zero. The
second equality follows by trivial algebra (−ξ ≤ξ if, and only if, ξ ≥0). The third
equality follows by conditioning on ⟨Y, s1,u⟩being equal to t and integrating t
out while noting that a correct decision can only be made if t ≥0, in which case
the condition ⟨Y, φ1⟩≥0 is satisﬁed automatically. The fourth equality follows
because, conditional on the signal s1,u being sent, the random variable ⟨Y, s1,u⟩is
independent of the random variables {|⟨Y, φν⟩|}2≤ν≤κ. The ﬁfth equality follows
because, conditional on s1,u being sent, the random variables {|⟨Y, φν⟩|}2≤ν≤κ are

The probability of error associated with an orthogonal constellation with κ signals
is better than that of the bi-orthogonal constellation with 2κ signals and equal
average energy. But the comparison is not quite fair because the bi-orthogonal
constellation is richer.
26.10
Detection in Colored Gaussian Noise
26.10.1
Overview
We next consider the problem of detecting known signals in noise that is Gaussian
but possibly “colored,” i.e., not white. Our setup is thus as in Section 26.2 except
that the noise N, while still stationary and Gaussian, is no longer assumed to be
white. Instead, we assume a general PSD SNN.
The solution is based on a “whitening ﬁlter” for the PSD SNN with respect to the
bandwidth W. This is a stable ﬁlter that when fed Gaussian noise of PSD SNN
produces WGN of double-sided PSD 1 with respect to the bandwidth W (Def-
inition 26.10.1 and Proposition 26.10.4 ahead).
It turns out that when such a
ﬁlter exists—and it usually does (Proposition 26.10.12)—an optimal solution to
our problem is to feed the observed SP Y to a whitening ﬁlter and to then base
our guess on the ﬁlter’s output.
The proof that there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on the ﬁlter’s
output is nontrivial (Theorem 26.10.9). But how to guess based on the ﬁlter’s
output is straightforward. Indeed, as we next argue, this guessing problem is of
the kind we already studied, i.e., that of detecting known signals (the response of
the ﬁlter to the mean signals) in WGN. To see this, let h be the impulse response of
a whitening ﬁlter. Conditional on M = m, we can then express the ﬁlter’s output
Y ⋆h as
Y ⋆h =

sm + N) ⋆h
= sm ⋆h + N ⋆h.
(26.105)
Here, because the ﬁlter is whitening, N⋆h is WGN of double-sided PSD 1 with re-
spect to the bandwidth W (Proposition 26.10.4 ahead). Thus, the guessing problem
based on the ﬁlter’s output is that of guessing which of the signals s1⋆h, . . . , sM⋆h
is being observed in WGN of double-sided PSD 1 with respect to the band-
width W. This is the setting addressed in Theorem 26.3.1 (with the substitution
of s1 ⋆h, . . . , sM ⋆h for the mean signals and of 1 for N0/2). From this theorem
it thus follows that for guessing M based on the whitening ﬁlter’s output Y ⋆h,
there is no loss of optimality in basing the decision on the inner-products vector

Y ⋆h, φ1

,
(26.106)
whenever (φ1, . . . , φd) is any orthonormal basis for
span(s1 ⋆h, . . . , sM ⋆h).
(26.107)
The solution is thus conceptually very simple. Most of the work will go into showing
that this procedure is optimal, i.e., that there is indeed no loss of optimality in
.028

26.10 Detection in Colored Gaussian Noise
653
guessing M based on the whitening ﬁlter’s output. This is prima facie not obvious
because the whitening ﬁlter need not be invertible. (But see Lemma 26.10.8 ahead.)
26.10.2
Whitening Filters
Deﬁnition 26.10.1 (Whitening Filter for SNN with respect to W). A ﬁlter of
impulse response h: R →R is said to be a whitening ﬁlter for SNN (or for N)
with respect to the bandwidth W if it is stable and its frequency response ˆh
satisﬁes
SNN(f)
ˆh(f)
2 = 1,
|f| ≤W.
(26.108)
Only the magnitude of the frequency response of the whitening ﬁlter is speciﬁed in
(26.108) and only for frequencies in the band [−W, W ]. The response is unspeciﬁed
outside this band. Consequently:
Note 26.10.2. There may be many diﬀerent whitening ﬁlters for SNN with respect
to the bandwidth W.
If SNN is zero at some frequencies in [−W, W ], then there is no whitening ﬁlter
for SNN with respect to W. Likewise, a whitening ﬁlter for SNN does not exist
if SNN is discontinuous in [−W, W ] (because the frequency response of a stable
ﬁlter must be continuous (Theorem 6.2.11), and if SNN is discontinuous, then so is
f 	→1/

|SNN(f)| ). Thus:
Note 26.10.3. A whitening ﬁlter for SNN with respect to W need not exist.
We shall see, however, that a whitening ﬁlter exists whenever throughout the inter-
val [−W, W ] the PSD SNN is strictly positive and is twice continuously diﬀerentiable
(Proposition 26.10.12).
The ﬁlter is called “whitening” because, by (26.108) and Theorem 25.13.2, we have:
Proposition 26.10.4. If

N(t), t ∈R

is a measurable, stationary, Gaussian SP
of PSD SNN, and if
h is the impulse response of a whitening ﬁlter for SNN with
respect to W, then

N(t)

⋆h is WGN of PSD 1 with respect to the bandwidth W.
From this proposition and (26.105) we obtain:
Corollary 26.10.5 (The Output of the Whitening Filter). If N and h are as above,
and Y ⋆h is the whitening ﬁlter’s response to the observed SP Y, then, conditional
on M = m,
Y ⋆h = sm ⋆h + ˜N,
(26.109)
where ˜N is WGN of double-sided PSD 1 with respect to the bandwidth W.
26.10.3
Optimality
Rather than proving the optimality of basing our guess on the whitening ﬁlter’s
output and then invoking Theorem 26.3.1 to prove the optimality of basing our
guess on the vector (26.106), we shall adopt a more direct approach and prove the
optimality of basing our guess on this vector directly. But ﬁrst we shall rewrite

Lemma 26.10.6 (The Adjoint of the Convolution: Deterministic Signals). Let h

u ⋆h, v

=

u, ~h∗⋆v

,
u, v ∈L2,
(26.112)
where h, u, and v may be complex.
Proof. The proof is based on changing the order of integration:

.
The change can be justiﬁed using Fubini’s Theorem: we integrate |h(t−τ) u(τ) v∗(t)|
ﬁrst over τ to obtain (|h| ⋆|u|)(t) |v(t)|; we use Inequality (5.11) to conclude that
|h|⋆|u| is energy-limited; and we then use this and the hypothesis that v is energy-
limited to argue that the integral of t 	→(|h|⋆|u|)(t) |v(t)| is ﬁnite (Cauchy-Schwarz
Inequality).
The result above extends to stochastic processes. Since we only deal here with real
stochastic processes and real whitening ﬁlters, we consider the real case only. The
next lemma allows us to replace u in Lemma 26.10.6 with a SP X. We only need
the lemma for WSS stochastic processes, but we shall state it a bit more generally.

Lemma 26.10.7 (The Adjoint of the Convolution: Stochastic Processes). Let X
be a measurable SP for which the function t 	→E[|X(t)|] is bounded. Let h and v
be real, deterministic, integrable signals. Then
⟨X ⋆h, v⟩= ⟨X, ~h ⋆v⟩
with probability one.
(26.113)
Proof. The inner product ⟨X ⋆h, v⟩can also be expressed as

(X ⋆h) ⋆~v

(0).
Likewise, ⟨X, ~h ⋆v⟩can be expressed as the convolution, evaluated at zero, of X
with the mirror image of (~h⋆v), i.e., as

X⋆(h⋆~v)

(0). The result thus follows from
the associativity of the convolution for stochastic processes (Lemma 15.7.1).
Using Lemma 26.10.7 and the fact that the union of a ﬁnite number of events
having probability zero also has probability zero (Corollary 21.5.2 (i)), we conclude
that (26.111) holds with probability one. Hence, upon substituting φ’s for q’s,

(26.115)
To prove this, we begin by exploring conditions that guarantee that the input to the
whitening ﬁlter be recoverable from its output. Such conditions are needed because
the ﬁlter’s frequency response could be zero outside the band [−W, W ], in which
case all input signals whose FT vanishes in this band produce the same all-zero
output, and their recovery from the ﬁlter’s output is thus impossible. However, if
the input is known to be bandlimited to W Hz, then recovery is possible:
Lemma 26.10.8 (Recovering the Input to a Whitening Filter from its Output).
Let h be the impulse response of a whitening ﬁlter for SNN with respect to the
bandwidth W. Let q be the ﬁlter’s response to the input s. If s is an integrable
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, then it can be recovered from q via the relation
s(t) =
 W
−W
ˆq(f)
ˆh(f)
ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(26.116)
Proof. Since q equals s ⋆h, where s is an integrable signal that is bandlimited
to W Hz and h is integrable, it follows that q is an integrable signal that is band-
limited to W Hz (Proposition 6.5.2) whose FT ˆq(f) is ˆs(f) ˆh(f) for all f ∈R
(Theorem 6.3.2). Since ˆh(f) is nonzero for all |f| ≤W (because h is a whitening
ﬁlter for SNN with respect to the bandwidth W) this implies—upon dividing by
ˆh(f) and restricting f to |f| ≤W—that
ˆs(f) = ˆq(f)
ˆh(f)
,
|f| ≤W.

Theorem 26.10.9 (Detecting Known Signals in Colored Gaussian Noise). Let M

Proof. We begin with Part (i). Let qm be the response of the whitening ﬁlter to
the mean signal sm:
qm = sm ⋆h,
m ∈M.
(26.127)
Since, by assumption, the mean signals are integrable signals that are bandlimited
to W Hz, it follows that so are the signals q1, . . . , qM (Proposition 6.5.2) and hence
also all the signals in span(q1, . . . , qM) including φ1, . . . , φd.
Since h is a whitening ﬁlter for SNN with respect to the bandwidth W, it is stable
h ∈L1,

The integrability of φℓimplies that ˆφℓis bounded (Theorem 6.2.11), which com-
bines with (26.128c) to show that the integrand in (26.130) is square integrable.
Consequently, the signals g1, . . . , gd are energy-limited signals that are bandlimited
to W Hz (Proposition 6.4.5 (ii)). By (26.130) and Proposition 6.5.1
gℓ⋆h = φℓ,

Let N′ be a measurable SP of the same law as N but independent of it. Thus,

We will show that, conditional on every message m ∈M, the FDDs of Y and Y′
are identical. This will show that there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess
of M on the vector (26.118) because the decoder can use its local randomness to

(which it can synthesize because the vector (26.118) is at its disposal) to form

Since Y and Y′ have the same conditional FDDs, this would result in the same
performance as if Y and not Y′ were fed to the guessing device.

the third by swapping summation and integration; the fourth by the deﬁnition of
gℓ(26.130); and the ﬁfth by (26.127) and Lemma 26.10.6.
Having established that Y and Y′ have identical conditional means, we next show
that, conditional on M = m, they also have identical autocovariance functions.
Since both Y and Y′ are Gaussian (conditional on M = m), this will establish
that Y and Y′ have identical FDDs given M = m. Subtracting the means, we

It now follows from (26.136) that the RHS of (26.133) equals KNN(τ), thus demon-
strating that conditional on M the autocovariance function of Y′ is KNN, and
hence concluding the proof that the conditional laws of Y and Y′ given M = m
are identical.
To conclude the proof of Part (i) it remains to compute the conditional law of
the vector (26.118) given M = m. Since (26.114) holds with probability one, this
conditional law is equal to the conditional law of

The conditional law of the latter can be easily computed, because the conditional
law of Y ⋆h given M = m is that of sm ⋆h + ˜N where ˜N is WGN of double-sided
PSD 1 with respect to W (Corollary 26.10.5), so the result follows directly from
Proposition 25.15.2 on linear functionals of WGN (with the substitution of 1 for
the double-sided PSD N0/2).
Part (ii) is a consequence of the linearity of the stochastic integral (Lemma 25.10.3).
It can be proved as follows. Let (φ1, . . . , φd) be, as before, an orthonormal ba-
sis for span(s1 ⋆h, . . . , sM ⋆h). Since, by assumption, each signal in the latter
subspace can be written as a linear combination of the signals ˜q1, . . . , ˜qn so can
the signals φ1, . . . , φd. Consequently, by the linearity of stochastic integration, the
vector (26.118) can be computed from (26.121). And since it is optimal to base our
guess of M on the former, it must also be optimal to base our guess on the latter.
Part (iii) follows from Part (ii) by deﬁning ˜qj as ˜sj ⋆h for every j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
As to Part (iv), the optimality of basing our guess on the vector (26.123) follows
from Part (iii), and its conditional law can be computed as follows: by Theo-
rem 25.12.1 it is conditionally Gaussian, and its conditional mean (26.124) and
conditional covariance (26.125) are readily derived using Theorem 25.12.2. To de-
rive (26.126), we note that by (26.123b) and Proposition 6.5.2 we have for every
m ∈M
qm(t) =
 W
−W
ˆsm(f) ˆh(f) ei2πft df,
t ∈R.
(26.137)
This, the Mini Parseval Theorem (Proposition 6.2.6 (i)), and (26.108) combine to
establish (26.126).
A diﬀerent way to compute the conditional distribution is to use (26.111): we
ﬁrst substitute M for n and q1, . . . , qM for q1, . . . , qn in (26.111) to infer that the
conditional law of the vector (26.123) is the same as the conditional law of

Y ⋆h, q1

, . . . ,

Y ⋆h, qM
T
.
(26.138)
We then compute the conditional law of the latter by noting that, conditional on
M = m, the law of Y ⋆h is that of sm ⋆h + ˜N, where ˜N is WGN of double-
sided PSD 1 with respect to W (Corollary 26.10.5), and by then invoking Propo-
sition 25.15.2 on linear functionals of WGN (with the substitution of 1 for the
double-sided PSD N0/2).
Since the conditional law of the random vector (26.123) is fully determined by the
inner products ⟨qm′, qm′′⟩for m′, m′′ ∈M (see (26.124) and (26.125)), and since,
by (26.126), the inner product ⟨qm′, qm′′⟩does not depend on the choice of the
whitening ﬁlter we obtain:
Note 26.10.10 (The Choice of the Whitening Filter Is Immaterial). Neither the
conditional distribution of the random vector in (26.123) nor the optimal proba-
bility of error depends on the choice of the whitening ﬁlter.
Using Theorem 26.10.9 we can now derive an optimal rule for guessing M. Indeed,
in analogy to Theorem 26.5.1 we have:

26.10.4
Existence of A Whitening Filter
Before concluding our discussion of detection in the presence of colored noise we
derive here a suﬃcient condition for the existence of a whitening ﬁlter.
Proposition 26.10.12 (Existence of a Whitening Filter). Let W > 0 be ﬁxed. If
throughout the interval [−W, W ] the PSD SNN is strictly positive and twice con-
tinuously diﬀerentiable, then there exists a whitening ﬁlter for SNN with respect to
the bandwidth W.
Proof. The proof hinges on the following basic result from harmonic analysis
(Katznelson, 2004, Chapter VI, Section 1, Exercise 7): if a function f 	→g(f)
is twice continuously diﬀerentiable and is zero outside some interval [−Δ, Δ], then
it is the FT of some integrable function.
To prove the proposition using this result we begin by picking some Δ > W. We
now deﬁne a function g: R →R as follows.
For f ≥Δ, we deﬁne g(f) = 0.
For f in the interval [0, W], we deﬁne g(f) = 1/

SNN(f). And for f ∈(W, Δ),
we deﬁne g(f) so that g be twice continuously diﬀerentiable in [0, ∞). We can
thus think of g in [W, Δ] as an interpolation function whose values and ﬁrst two
derivatives are speciﬁed at the endpoints of the interval. Finally, for f < 0, we
deﬁne g(f) as g(−f). Figure 26.11 depicts SNN, g, W, and Δ.
A whitening ﬁlter for SNN with respect to the bandwidth W is the integrable
function whose FT is g and whose existence is guaranteed by the quoted result.
26.11
Multiple Antennas
In some applications the receiver can guess the message based on more than one
received waveform. For example, the receiver may employ a number of antennas,
each of which receives the desired signal contaminated by diﬀerent noise. More
generally, we consider nR received waveforms Y1, . . . , YnR and assume that con-
ditional on M = m, they are given by
Yη = sm,η + Nη,
η = 1, . . . , nR,

where the nR stochastic processes N1, . . . , NnR are independent stochastic pro-
cesses, each of which is WGN of spectral density N0/2 with respect to the band-
width W, and where sm,η—which is assumed to be an integrable signal that is
bandlimited to W Hz—is the mean-signal in the η-th antenna corresponding to the
m-th message.
Theorem 26.3.1 extends to this setup as follows:
Theorem 26.11.1 (Detection with Multiple Antennas). Consider the setup above
and assume that for each antenna η ∈{1, . . . , nR}, the dη signals φ1,η, . . . , φdη,η
form an orthonormal basis for
span(s1,η, . . . , sM,η).
Then, in the same sense as in Theorem 26.3.1, there is no loss of optimality in
guessing M based on the d1 + · · · + dnR inner products

Proof. We only sketch the proof because it is just a small variation on that of
Theorem 26.3.1. Given any (measurable) decoder that is based on Y1, . . . , Yη we
propose a randomized decision rule of identical performance that is based on the
inner products only. The proposed decoder uses its local randomness to produce
nR independent WGN processes N′

26.12
Detecting Signals of Inﬁnite Bandwidth
So far we have only dealt with the detection problem when the mean signals are
bandlimited. What if they are not? The diﬃculty in this case is that we can no
longer assume that the noise PSD is constant over the bandwidth occupied by the
mean signals, or that the noise can be whitened with respect to this bandwidth.
We can address this issue in three diﬀerent ways. In the ﬁrst we can try to ﬁnd the
optimal detector by studying this more complicated hypothesis testing problem. It
will no longer be optimal to base our guess on the inner-products vector (26.12).
The optimal detector will greatly depend on the relationship between the rate of
decay of the PSD of the noise as the frequency tends to ±∞and the rate of decay of
the FT of the mean signals. This approach will often lead to bad designs, because
the structure of the receiver will depend greatly on how we model the noise, and
inaccuracies in our modeling of the noise PSD at ultra-high frequencies might lead
us completely astray in our design.
A more level-headed approach that is valid if the noise PSD is “essentially ﬂat
over the bandwidth of interest” is to ignore the fact that the mean signals are not
bandlimited and to base our decision on the inner-products vector, even if this is
not fully justiﬁed mathematically. This approach leads to robust designs that are
insensitive to inaccuracies in our modeling of the noise process. If the PSD is not
essentially ﬂat, we can whiten it with respect to a suﬃciently large band [−W, W ]
that contains most of the energy of the mean signals.
The third approach is to use very complicated mathematical machinery involving
the Itˆo Calculus (Karatzas and Shreve, 1991) to model the noise in a way that will
result in the optimality of basing our decision on the inner-products vector. We
have chosen not to pursue this approach because it requires modeling the noise as
a process of inﬁnite power, which is physically unappealing. This approach just
swaps one diﬃculty for another: the Itˆo Calculus can now prove for us that it is
optimal to base our decision on the inner-products vector, but we need a leap of
faith in modeling the noise as a process of inﬁnite power.
In the future, in dealing with mean signals that are not bandlimited, we shall refer
to the “white noise paradigm” as the paradigm under which the receiver forms
its decision based on the inner-products vector (26.12) and under which these inner
products have the conditional law derived in Section 26.4.1.

Chapter 27
Noncoherent Detection and Nuisance
Parameters
27.1
Introduction and Motivation
This chapter discusses a detection problem that arises in noncoherent communi-
cations.
For motivation, consider a transmitter that sends one of two diﬀerent
passband waveforms
t 	→2 Re

s0,BB(t) ei2πfct
or
t 	→2 Re

s1,BB(t) ei2πfct
,
where s0,BB and s1,BB are integrable baseband signals that are bandlimited to W/2
Hz, and where the carrier frequency fc satisﬁes fc > W/2. To motivate our problem
it is instructive to consider the case where
fc ≫W.
(27.1)
(In wireless communications it is common for fc to be orders-of-magnitude larger
than W.)
Let X(t) denote the transmitted waveform at time t.
Suppose that
the received waveform

Y (t)

is a delayed version of the transmitted waveform
corrupted by WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W
around the carrier frequency fc (Deﬁnition 25.15.9):
Y (t) = X(t −tD) + N(t),
t ∈R,
where tD denotes the delay (typically proportional to the distance between the
transmitter and the receiver) and

N(t)

is the additive noise. Suppose further
that the receiver estimates the delay to be t′
D and moves its clock back by deﬁning
t′ ≜t −t′
D.
(27.2)
If ˜Y (t′) is what the receiver receives when its clock shows t′, then by (27.2)
˜Y (t′) = Y (t′ + t′
D)
= X(t′ + t′
D −tD) + N(t′ + t′

= X(t′ + t′

, also WGN of
double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W around fc. The term
X(t′ + t′

(27.3)
where ν is either zero or one, depending on which waveform is sent.
We next argue that if
t′
D −tD
 ≪1
W,
(27.4)
then
sν,BB(t′ + t′
D −tD) ≈sν,BB(t′),
t′ ∈R.
(27.5)
This can be seen by considering a Taylor Series expansion for sν,BB(·) around t′
sν,BB(t′ + t′
D −tD) ≈sν,BB(t′) + dsν,BB(τ)

and by then using Bernstein’s Inequality (Theorem 6.7.1) to heuristically argue
that the magnitude of the derivative of the baseband signal is of the same order of
magnitude as W, so its product by the timing error is, by (27.4), negligible.
From (27.3) and (27.5) we obtain that, as long as (27.4) holds,
X(t′ + t′
D −tD) ≈2 Re

t′ ∈R,
(27.6a)
where
θ = 2πfc(t′
D −tD)
mod [−π, π).
(27.6b)
(Recall that ξ mod [−π, π) is the element in the interval [−π, π) that diﬀers from ξ
by an integer multiple of 2π.) Note that even if (27.4) holds, the term 2πfc(t′
D−tD)
may be much larger than 1 when fc ≫W.
We conclude that if the error in estimating the delay is negligible compared to the
reciprocal of the signal bandwidth but signiﬁcantly larger than the reciprocal of
the carrier frequency, then the received waveform can be modeled as
˜Y (t′) = 2 Re

sν,BB(t′) ei(2πfct′+θ)
+ ˜N(t′),
t′ ∈R,
(27.7)
where the receiver needs to determine whether ν is equal to zero or one;
 ˜N(t′)

is additive WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W
around fc; and where the phase θ is unknown to the receiver. Since the phase is
unknown to the receiver, the detection is said to be noncoherent. In the statistics
literature an unknown parameter such as θ is called a nuisance parameter.
It would make engineering sense to ask for a decision rule for guessing ν based
on
 ˜Y (t′)

that would work well irrespective of the value of θ, but this is not the
question we shall ask. This question is related to “composite hypothesis testing,”

Noncoherent Detection and Nuisance Parameters
which is not treated in this book.1 Instead we shall adopt a probabilistic approach.
We shall assume that θ is a random variable—and therefore henceforth denote it
by Θ and its realization by θ—that is uniformly distributed over the interval [−π, π)
independently of the noise and the message, and we shall seek a decision rule that
has the smallest average probability of error. Thus, if we denote the probability
of error conditional on Θ = θ by p(error|θ), then we seek a decision rule based
on
 ˜Y (t)

that minimizes

−π
p(error|θ) dθ.
(27.8)
The conservative reader may prefer to minimize the probability of error on the
“worst case θ”
sup
θ∈[−π,π)
p(error|θ)
(27.9)
but, miraculously, it will turn out that the decoder we shall derive to minimize (27.8)
has a conditional probability of error p(error|θ) that does not depend on the real-
ization θ so, as we shall see in Section 27.7, our decoder also minimizes (27.9).
27.2
The Setup
We next deﬁne our hypothesis testing problem.
We denote time by t and the
received waveform by

Y (t)

(even though in the scenario we described in Sec-
tion 27.1 these correspond to t′ and
 ˜Y (t′)

, i.e., to the time coordinate and to the
corresponding signal at the receiver). We denote the RV we wish to guess by H
and assume a uniform prior:
Pr[H = 0] = Pr[H = 1] = 1
2.
(27.10)
For each ν ∈{0, 1} the observation

Y (t)

is, conditionally on H = ν, of the form
Y (t) = Sν(t) + N(t),
t ∈R,

is WGN of positive double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the

27.3 From a SP to a Random Vector

Notice that by (27.13) and by the relationship between inner products in baseband
and passband (Theorem 7.6.10),
⟨sν,c, sν,s⟩= 0,
ν = 0, 1.
(27.14)
We assume that the baseband signals s0,BB, s1,BB are integrable complex signals
that are bandlimited to W/2 Hz and that they are orthogonal:
⟨s0,BB, s1,BB⟩= 0.
(27.15)
Consequently, by (27.13) and Theorem 7.6.10,

From a SP to a Random Vector
To derive an optimal guessing rule, we begin by exhibiting a random 4-vector, which
is computable from the observed SP

Y (t)

and on which we can base our decision
without loss of optimality. This will transform the problem from one where the
observation is a SP to one where it is a random 4-vector. (For the latter problem
we shall later exhibit a suﬃcient statistic vector with only two components.) We
denote random vector by T and its four components by T0,c, T0,s, T1,c, and T1,s:
T =

T0,c, T0,s, T1,c, T1,s

We denote its realization by t with corresponding components

We now prove that there is no loss of optimality in guessing H based on T. It is
interesting to note that this holds for Θ of arbitrary distribution (not necessarily
uniform) provided that the pair (H, Θ) is independent of the additive noise. More-
over, it holds even if the baseband signals s0,BB and s1,BB are not orthogonal. The
key is that, irrespective of the realization of Θ and of the value of ν, the signal Sν
lies in the four-dimensional subspace spanned by the signals s0,c, s0,s, s1,c, and s1,s.
The result thus follows from a generalization of Theorem 26.3.1 that we state next.
Theorem 27.3.1 (White Gaussian Noise with Nuisance Parameters). Let V be
a d-dimensional subspace of the space of all integrable signals that are bandlimited
to W Hz, and let (φ1, . . . , φd) be an orthonormal basis for V. Let the RV M take
values in a ﬁnite set M. Suppose that, conditional on M = m, the SP

Y (t)

is
given by
Y (t) =
d

ℓ=1
A(ℓ)φℓ(t) + N(t),
t ∈R,
(27.23)
where A = (A(1), . . . , A(d))T is a random d-vector whose law typically depends
on m, and where the SP

N(t)

is WGN with respect to the bandwidth W and
independent of the pair (M, A). Then no measurable rule for guessing M based on

Y (t)

can outperform an optimal rule for guessing M based on the d-vector
T =

⟨Y, φ1⟩, . . . , ⟨Y, φd⟩
T.
(27.24)
The theorem also holds in passband, i.e., if V is a d-dimensional subspace of the
space of all integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier
frequency fc and if

N(t)

is WGN with respect to the bandwidth W around fc.
Note 27.3.2. Theorem 27.3.1 continues to hold even if (φ1, . . . , φd) is not or-
thonormal; it suﬃces that it be a basis for V. Indeed, if (u1, . . . , ud) is a basis
(not necessarily orthonormal) for V and if (v1, . . . , vd) is another basis (possibly
orthonormal) for V, then the inner products {⟨Y, vℓ⟩}d
ℓ=1 are computable from the
inner products {⟨Y, uℓ⟩}d
ℓ=1 (Lemma 25.10.3).
Before presenting the proof of Theorem 27.3.1 we show how it can be applied to
the noncoherent detection problem at hand. Here d = 4 and
V = span(s0,c, s0,s, s1,c, s1,s),
(27.25)
with φ1 ≜s0,c/√Es, φ2 ≜s0,s/√Es, φ3 ≜s1,c/√Es, and φ4 ≜s1,s/√Es. We note
that, conditional on H = 0, the received waveform

form (27.23) where A(3) & A(4) are deterministically zero and the pair

A(1), A(2)
is uniformly distributed over the unit circle:

A(1)2 +

A(2)2 = 1.
Similarly, conditional on H = 1, the random variables A(1) and A(2) are deter-
ministically zero and the pair

A(3), A(4)
is uniformly distributed over the unit
circle. Thus, once we prove Theorem 27.3.1, it will follow that there is no loss of
optimality in forming our guess based on the 4-vector in (27.22).
Proof of Theorem 27.3.1. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 26.3.1.
We prove the result by showing that, given any measurable guessing rule φGuess(·)
that is based on Y, we can ﬁnd a randomized decision rule of identical performance
that is based on T. As in the proof of Theorem 26.3.1, our decision rule uses local
randomness to generate a SP N′ of the same FDDs as N and independent of
(M, A, N). From T and N′ it then generates
Y′ =
d

ℓ=1
⟨Y, φℓ⟩φℓ+ N′ −
d

ℓ=1
⟨N′, φℓ⟩φℓ
(27.26)
and produces φGuess(Y′). To see that our rule has the same performance as the rule
that guesses φGuess(Y), we note that, as in the proof of Theorem 26.3.1, Y and Y′
have identical conditional FDDs given (M = m, A = a).
Consequently, upon
taking the expectation over A, we obtain that they also have the same conditional
FDDs given M = m. Hence the guesses φGuess(Y) and φGuess(Y′) have identical
performance.
27.4
The Conditional Law of the Random Vector
Having established in the previous section that there is no loss of optimality in
basing our guess on the vector T in (27.21), we next proceed to calculate its
conditional distribution given H. This will allow us to compute the likelihood-
ratio fT|H=0(t)/fT|H=1(t) and to thus obtain an optimal guessing rule.
Rather than computing the conditional distribution directly, we begin with the
simpler conditional distribution of T given (H, Θ).
Conditional on (H, Θ), the
vector T is Gaussian (Theorem 25.12.1). Consequently, to compute its conditional
distribution we only need to compute its conditional mean vector and covariance
matrix, which we proceed to do.
Conditional on (H, Θ) = (ν, θ), the observed
process

Y (t)

can be expressed as
Y (t) = sν,c(t) cos θ + sν,s(t) sin θ + N(t),
t ∈R.
(27.27)
Hence, since

the conditional mean of each of four random variables conditional on each of two
hypotheses, thus requiring eight calculations, which are all very similar but not
identical. We shall carry out only one calculation:

by writing ⟨s0,c, s0,c⟩as ∥s0,c∥2
2; and the ﬁnal equality from (27.20).
We next compute the conditional covariance matrix of T given (H, Θ) = (ν, θ). By
the orthonormality (27.20) and the whiteness of the noise (Proposition 25.15.2) we
have that, irrespective of ν and θ, this conditional covariance matrix is given by
the 4 × 4 matrix (N0/2)I4, where I4 is the 4 × 4 identity matrix.
Using the explicit form of the Gaussian distribution (19.6) and deﬁning

which is computable from t0 and t1. This proves that the pair (T0, T1) deﬁned in
(27.31) forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing H based on T (Deﬁnition 20.12.2).
Having identiﬁed (T0, T1) as a suﬃcient statistic, we now proceed to derive an
optimal decision rule using two diﬀerent methods.
The ﬁrst method, which is
summarized in (20.79), ignores the fact that (T0, T1) is suﬃcient and proceeds to
base the decision on the likelihood-ratio of T (27.37). The second method, which
is summarized in (20.80), bases the decision on the likelihood-ratio of the pair
(T0, T1).
Method 1:
Since we assumed a uniform prior (27.10), an optimal decision rule
is to guess “H = 0” whenever fT|H=0(t)/fT|H=1(t) ≥1, which, by (27.37) is
equivalent to

This rule can be further simpliﬁed by noting that I0(ξ) is (strictly) increasing in ξ
for ξ ≥0. (This can be veriﬁed by computing the derivative from (27.35)

is also (strictly) increasing and the guessing rule
(27.38) is thus equivalent to the rule
Guess “H = 0” if t0 ≥t1.

27.5 An Optimal Detector
679
Method 2:
We can obtain the same result by considering the likelihood-ratio
function of the suﬃcient statistic (T0, T1)
fT0,T1|H=0(t0, t1)
fT0,T1|H=1(t0, t1).
We begin by arguing that, conditional on H = 0, the random variables T0, T1,
and Θ are independent with
fT0,T1,Θ|H=0(t0, t1, θ) = 1
2π fχ2
2,λ1(t0) fχ2
2,λ0(t1),
(27.40)
where fχ2
n,λ(x) denotes the density at x of the noncentral χ2 distribution with n
degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter λ (Section 19.8.2), and where
λ0 = 0
and
λ1 = Es
σ2 .
(27.41)
To prove (27.40) we compute for every t0, t1 ∈R and θ ∈[−π, π)
fT0,T1,Θ|H=0(t0, t1, θ) = fΘ|H=0(θ) fT0,T1|H=0,Θ=θ(t0, t1)
= 1
2π fT0,T1|H=0,Θ=θ(t0, t1)

= 1
2π fχ2
2,λ1(t0) fχ2
2,λ0(t1),
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the deﬁnition of the conditional density; the
second because Θ is independent of H and is uniformly distributed over the interval
[−π, π); the third because, conditional on (H, Θ) = (0, θ), the random variables
T0,c, T0,s, T1,c, T1,s are independent (Section 27.4), and because T0 is a function
of (T0,c, T0,s) whereas T1 is a function of (T1,c, T1,s) (see (27.31)); and the ﬁnal
equality follows because, conditional on (H, Θ) = (0, θ), the random variables
T0,c, T0,s, T1,c, T1,s are variance-σ2 Gaussians with means speciﬁed in (27.28a) (Sec-
tion 19.8.2).
Integrating out θ in (27.40) we obtain that, conditional on H, the random variables
T0 and T1 are independent with
fT0,T1|H=0(t0, t1) = fχ2
2,λ1(t0) fχ2
2,λ0(t1)
(27.42a)
fT0,T1|H=1(t0, t1) = fχ2
2,λ0(t0) fχ2
2,λ1(t1),
(27.42b)
where the expression for fT0,T1|H=1(t0, t1) is obtained using analogous steps.
Since H has a uniform prior, an optimal decision rule is thus to guess “H = 0”
whenever
fχ2
2,λ1(t0) fχ2
2,λ0(t1) ≥fχ2
2,λ0(t0) fχ2
2,λ1(t1).
Since λ1 > λ0, this will hold, by Proposition 19.8.3, whenever t0 ≥t1. And by the
same proposition the inequality

2,λ1(t0) fχ2
2,λ0(t1) ≤fχ2

Noncoherent Detection and Nuisance Parameters
will hold whenever t0 ≤t1. It is thus optimal to guess “H = 0” whenever t0 ≥t1
and to guess “H = 1” whenever t0 < t1. (It does not matter how we guess when
t0 = t1.) The decision rule (27.39) has thus been recovered.
27.6
The Probability of Error
In this section we compute the probability of error for the optimal guessing rule
(27.39). Since the probability of a tie (i.e., of T0 = T1) is zero both conditional on
H = 0 and conditional on H = 1, we shall analyze a slightly simpler guessing rule
that guesses “H = 0” if T0 > T1, and guesses “H = 1” if T1 > T0.
We begin with the conditional probability of error given that H = 0, i.e., with
Pr[T1 ≥T0 |H = 0]. Conditional on H = 0, the question of whether our decoder
errs depends prima facie not only on the realization of the additive noise

N(t)

but also on the realization of Θ. But this is not the case because, conditionally on
H = 0, the pair (T0, T1) is independent of Θ (see (27.40)), so the realization of Θ
does not play a role in the sense that for every θ ∈[−π, π)
Pr

T1 ≥T0
 H = 0, Θ = θ

= Pr

T1 ≥T0
 H = 0, Θ = 0

(27.43)
Conditional on (H, Θ) = (0, θ) we have by (27.40) that T0 and T1 are independent
with T0 ∼χ2
2,λ1 and with T1 ∼χ2
2,λ0, i.e., with T1 having a mean-2 exponential
distribution (Note 19.8.1)

Thus, if we denote by pMAP(error|Θ = θ) the conditional probability of error of

by (27.45) & (27.46)

Discussion
The detector we derived has the property that its error probability does not depend
on the realization of the nuisance parameter Θ; see (27.47). This property makes
the detector robust with respect to the distribution of Θ: since the conditional
probability of error does not depend on the realization of Θ, neither does the
average performance depend on the distribution of Θ.
(Of course, if Θ is not
uniform, then our decoder need not be optimal.)
We next show that our guessing rule is also conservative in the sense that it mini-
mizes the worst-case performance:
sup
θ∈[−π,π)
p(error|Θ = θ).

pMAP(error|Θ = θ) = 1

(27.50)
Thus, while other decoders may outperform our decoder for some realizations of Θ,
for other realizations their probability of error will be at least as high. Indeed, if
p′(error|Θ = θ) is the conditional probability of error associated with any guessing
rule, then

where the ﬁrst inequality follows because the average (over θ) cannot exceed the
supremum; the second inequality because the decoder we designed minimizes the
unconditional probability of error; and the last two equalities follow from (27.47),
i.e., from the fact that the conditional probability of error pMAP(error|Θ = θ) of
our decoder does not depend on θ and is equal to the RHS of (27.47).
It is interesting to assess the degradation in performance due to our ignorance
of Θ. To that end we now compare the performance of our decoder with that of
the “coherent decoder.” The coherent decoder is an optimal decoder for the setting
where the realization of Θ is known to the receiver, i.e., when the receiver can form
its guess based on both

Y (t)

and Θ. If the receiver knows Θ, it can compute
S0 and S1, and the problem reduces to the problem of guessing which of the two
known signals is being observed in WGN. Irrespective of Θ, the signals S0 and S1
are orthogonal and of energy Es (by (27.12), (27.16), and (27.19)). Consequently,
the coherent guessing problem is the binary version of the problem we discussed in
Section 26.9.3. An optimal coherent guessing rule is thus
guess “H = 0” if

27.8 Extension to M ≥2 Signals
683
Comparing (27.52) with (27.48) we see that if Es/σ2 is large, then we pay only
a small penalty for not knowing the phase.3 Of course, if the phase were known
precisely we might have used antipodal signaling with the resulting probability of
error being lower; see (26.66).4
27.8
Extension to M ≥2 Signals
We next brieﬂy address the M-ary version of the problem of noncoherent detec-
tion of orthogonal signals. We now denote the RV to be guessed by M and re-
place (27.10) with the assumption that M is uniformly distributed over the set
M = {1, . . . , M}, where M ≥2.
We wish to guess the value of M based on
the observation

Y (t)

(27.11), where ν now takes values in M and where the
orthogonality conditions (27.15) & (27.18) are now written as
⟨sν′,BB, sν′′,BB⟩= 1
2 Es I{ν′ = ν′′},
ν′, ν′′ ∈M.
(27.53)
We ﬁrst argue that no measurable decision rule that is based on Y can outperform
an optimal rule for guessing M based on the vector

T1, . . . , TM
T,
(27.54)
where, in analogy to (27.31), we deﬁne
Tν = T 2

ν ∈M,
and where
Tν,c =
#
Y, sν,c

$
and
Tν,s =

$
,
ν ∈M.
To this end, we ﬁrst note that, by Theorem 27.3.1, we can base our decision on the
collection
'
(Tν,c, Tν,s)
(
ν∈M.
(27.55)
To show that (T1, . . . , TM)T forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing M based on this
collection, it is enough to show pairwise suﬃciency (Proposition 22.3.2). Pairwise
suﬃciency can be proved using Proposition 22.4.2 because for every m′ ̸= m′′
in M our analysis of the binary problem shows that the tuple (Tm′, Tm′′) forms
a suﬃcient statistic for testing between m′ and m′′, and this tuple is computable
from the vector in (27.54).
Our analysis of the binary case shows that, after observing

Y (t)

, the a posteriori
probability of the event M = m is larger than the a posteriori distribution of the
3Although p∗(error)/p∗
coherent(error) tends to inﬁnity as Es/σ2 →∞, it does so only subex-
ponentially.
4Comparing (26.87) and (26.66) we see that, to achieve the same probability of error, binary
orthogonal keying requires twice as much energy as antipodal signaling.

event M = m′ whenever Tm > Tm′. Consequently, Message m has the highest a
posteriori probability if Tm = maxm′∈M Tm′. Thus, the decision rule
Guess “M = m” if Tm = max
m′∈M Tm′
(27.56)
is optimal. The probability of a tie is zero, so it does not matter how ties are
resolved.
We next turn to the analysis of the probability of error. We shall assume that
a tie results in an error, so, conditional on M = m, an error occurs whenever
max{T1, . . . , Tm−1, Tm+1, . . . , TM} ≥Tm.
We ﬁrst show that, as in the binary
case, the probability of error associated with this guessing rule depends neither on
the realization of Θ nor on the message, i.e., that for every m ∈M and θ ∈[−π, π)
pMAP(error|M = m, Θ = θ) = pMAP(error|M = 1, Θ = 0).
(27.57)
To see this note that, conditional on (M, Θ) = (m, θ), the components of the vec-
tor (27.54) are independent, with the m-th component being χ2
2,Es/σ2 and with the
other components being χ2
2,0. Consequently, irrespective of θ and m, the condi-
tional probability of error is the probability that a χ2
2,Es/σ2 RV is exceeded by, or
is equal to, at least one of M −1 IID χ2
2,0 random variables that are independent
of it. In the analysis of the probability of error we shall thus assume that M = 1
and that θ = 0.
The probability that the maximum among the random variables T2, . . . , TM exceeds
or is equal to ξ is given for every ξ ≥0 by
Pr

max{T2, . . . , TM} ≥ξ

where the ﬁrst equality follows because the probabilities of an event and of its
complement sum to one; the second because the maximum is smaller than ξ if,
and only if, all the random variables are smaller than ξ; the third because, con-
ditionally on M = 1 and Θ = 0, the random variables T2, . . . , TM are IID; the
fourth because conditional on M = 1 and Θ = 0, the RV T2 is a mean-2 exponen-
tial (Note 19.8.1); and the ﬁnal equality follows from the binomial formula (26.85)
with the substitution a = 1, b = −e−ξ/2, and n = M −1. The probability of error

Chapter 28
Detecting PAM and QAM Signals in White
Gaussian Noise
28.1
Introduction and Setup
In Chapter 26 we addressed the problem of detecting one of M bandwidth-W sig-
nals corrupted by additive Gaussian noise that is white with respect to the band-
width W. Except for assuming that the mean signals are integrable signals that
are bandlimited to W Hz, we made no assumptions about their structure. In this
chapter we study the implication of the results of Chapter 26 for Pulse Amplitude
Modulation, where the mean signals correspond to diﬀerent possible outputs of a
PAM modulator. The conclusions we shall draw are extremely important for the
design of receivers for systems employing PAM.
The key result of this chapter is that when PAM signals are observed in WGN, there
is no loss of optimality in the receiver basing its guess on the inner products between
the received waveform and the time shifts of the pulse shape by integer multiples of
the baud period Ts. These inner products can be computed by feeding the received
waveform to a matched ﬁlter that is matched to the pulse shape deﬁning the PAM
signals and by then sampling the ﬁlter’s output at integer multiples of the baud
period Ts (Corollary 5.8.3).
Using this result we can reduce the guessing problem from one where the observa-
tion is a continuous-time stochastic process to one where it is a discrete-time SP.
In fact, since we shall only consider the problem of detecting a ﬁnite number of
data bits, the reduction will be to a ﬁnite number of random variables. This will
justify the canonical structure of a PAM receiver where the received continuous-
time waveform is fed to a matched ﬁlter whose sampled output is then used by the
decision circuitry to produce its guess. We shall derive the results ﬁrst for PAM
and then brieﬂy describe their extension to QAM in Section 28.5.
In our setup k data bits D1, . . . , Dk are mapped by an encoder ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn to
the real symbols X1, . . . , Xn, which are then mapped to the transmitted waveform
X(t) = A


X(t)

. Based
on the received waveform

Y (t)

we wish to guess the data bits D1, . . . , Dk.
To simplify the typesetting we stack the k data bits D1, . . . , Dk in a binary vector
D = (D1, . . . , Dk)T,
(28.3)
the n symbols X1, . . . , Xn in a vector
X = (X1, . . . , Xn)T,
(28.4)
and we write
X = ϕ(D).
(28.5)
We express the n-tuple ϕ(d) that the encoder produces when D = d as
ϕ(d) =

x1(d), . . . , xn(d)
T,
(28.6)
where xν(d) is the ν-th real symbol that the encoder produces when it is fed d.
We denote the waveform that is transmitted to convey d by x(·; d), so
x(t; d) = A

ℓ=1
xℓ(d) g(t −ℓTs),

Conditional on D = d, the received waveform is thus
Y (t) = x(t; d) + N(t),
t ∈R.
(28.8)
28.2
A Random Vector and Its Conditional Law
We can view the vector D = (D1, . . . , Dk)T as a message and view the 2k diﬀerent
values it can take as the set of messages. To promote this view we deﬁne
D ≜{0, 1}k
(28.9)
to be the set of all 2k binary k-tuples, and we view D as the set of possible mes-
sages. In Chapter 21 on multi-hypothesis testing we denoted the set of hypotheses
(messages) by M and we labeled them 1, . . . , M, but we never attached a meaning
to the labels. So there is no harm in now labeling the hypotheses (messages) by
the binary k-tuples.

(28.10)
If we assume that the data bits are IID random bits (Deﬁnition 14.5.1), then
πd = 2−k for every k-tuple d ∈D, but this assumption is inessential to our
derivation.
Conditional on D = d, the transmitted waveform is x(·; d) of (28.7). Thus, the
problem of guessing D is equivalent to guessing which of the 2k signals
'
t 	→x(t; d)
(
d∈D
(28.11)
is being observed in WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the band-
width W. From (28.7) it follows that for every message d ∈D the transmitted
waveform t 	→x(t; d) is a (deterministic) linear combination of the n functions
{t 	→g(t −ℓTs)}n
ℓ=1. Moreover, if the pulse shape g(·) is an integrable function
that is bandlimited to W Hz, then so is each waveform t 	→x(t; d) . Consequently,
from Theorem 26.3.1 (ii) and Theorem 26.4.1 (ii) we obtain:
Proposition 28.2.1 (Reducing the Output to a Random Vector: PAM in WGN).
Let the conditional law of

Y (t)

given D = d be given by (28.5), (28.7), and (28.8),
where the pulse shape g is a real integrable signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, and
where

N(t)

is WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W.
Then no measurable rule for guessing D based on

Other Optimality Criteria
Proposition 28.2.1 establishes that if our objective is to minimize the probability of
a message error, then there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on the vector
of inner products T = (T (1), . . . , T (n))T. But what if our objective is diﬀerent? We
shall next consider other design criteria and show that, for those too, there is no
loss of optimality in basing our guess on T. Readers who can recall the proof of
Theorem 26.3.1 on which Proposition 28.2.1 is based will surely not be surprised.
We ﬁrst elaborate on what a message error is. If we denote our guess by
˜d =
 ˜d1, . . . , ˜dk
T,
then a message error occurs if our guess diﬀers from the message d in at least one
component, i.e., if ˜dℓ̸= dℓfor some ℓ∈{1, . . . , k}. The probability of a message
error is thus
Pr
 ˜D ̸= D

.
(28.16)
Designing the receiver to minimize the probability of a message error is reason-
able, for example, when the k data bits constitute a computer ﬁle, and we wish to
minimize the probability that the ﬁle is corrupted. In such applications the user’s
primary concern is whether the ﬁle was successfully received (no error occurred)
or whether it was corrupted (at least one error occurred). Minimizing the proba-
bility of a message error corresponds to minimizing the probability that the ﬁle is
corrupted.
In other applications, engineers are more interested in the average probability
of a bit error or bit error rate (BER). That is, they may wish to minimize
1
k
k

j=1
Pr
 ˜Dj ̸= Dj

.
(28.17)
To better appreciate the diﬀerence between the BER (28.17) and the probability
of a message error (28.16), deﬁne the RV
Ej = I
 ˜Dj ̸= Dj

,
j ∈{1, . . . , k},
which indicates whether the j-th bit was incorrectly decoded.

(28.18)
Thus, minimizing the probability of a message error is equivalent to minimizing
the probability that one or more of the data bits are in error, whereas minimizing
the BER is equivalent to minimizing the expected number of data bits in error.
We next argue that there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on T also
when we wish to minimize the BER (28.17). We ﬁrst note that to minimize (28.17)
we should choose for each j ∈{1, . . . , k} our guess ˜Dj to minimize
Pr
 ˜Dj ̸= Dj

.
That is, we should consider the binary hypothesis testing problem of guessing
whether Dj is equal to zero or one, and we should guess ˜Dj to minimize the
probability of error associated with this problem. To conclude our argument we
next show that for the purpose of minimizing Pr
 ˜Dj ̸= Dj

, there is no loss of
optimality in basing our decision on T.
To prove this we will show that for every measurable guessing rule φGuess(·) for
guessing Dj based on Y, we can ﬁnd a randomized decision rule based on T of
identical probability of error. As in the proof of Theorem 26.3.1, the randomized
decision rule uses its local randomness and T to generate a SP Y′ whose conditional
FDDs given D are identical to those of Y. It then produces the guess φGuess(Y′).
Since the conditional FDDs of Y and Y′ given D = d are identical for every d ∈D,
Pr
%
φGuess(Y) ̸= Dj
 D = d
&
= Pr
%
φGuess(Y′) ̸= Dj
 D = d
&
,
d ∈D.
(28.19)
Since this is true for every d ∈D, we can take the expectation over D to obtain
Pr
%
φGuess(Y) ̸= Dj
&
= Pr
%
φGuess(Y′) ̸= Dj
&
,
(28.20)
i.e., that the randomized decoder that is based on T has the same performance as
φGuess(·).
This argument can be applied also to more general performance measures:
Proposition 28.3.1. Consider the setup of Proposition 28.2.1. Let ψ: d 	→ψ(d)
be any function of the data bits, and let D have an arbitrary prior.
Then no
measurable guessing rule for guessing ψ(D) based on

Y (t)

can outperform an
optimal rule for guessing ψ(D) based on

T (1), . . . , T (n)
.
Proof. The proof is almost identical to the one we used above to treat the bit-
error-rate criterion. Once again we consider any measurable decision rule φGuess(·)
for guessing ψ(D), and we mimic its performance by guessing φGuess(Y′), where Y′
is generated using local randomness from T. Analogously to (28.19),
Pr
%
φGuess(Y) ̸= ψ(D)
 D = d
&
= Pr
%
φGuess(Y′) ̸= ψ(D)
 D = d
&
,
d ∈D.
(28.21)
from which the result follows by taking expectation over D.

The examples we have seen so far correspond to the case where ψ: d 	→d (with the

case ψ: d 	→dj (with the probability of guessing ψ(D) incorrectly corresponding
to the probability that the j-th bit Dj is incorrectly decoded). Another useful
example is when ψ: d 	→

for some given ν, ν′ ∈N satisfying ν′ ≥ν.
This situation corresponds to the case where (Dν, . . . , Dν′) constitutes a packet
and we are interested in the probability that the packet is erroneously decoded.
Yet another example arises in block-mode transmission—which is described in Sec-
tion 10.4 and which is depicted in Figure 28.1—where the data bits D1, . . . , Dk are
mapped to the symbols X1, . . . , Xn using a (K, N) binary-to-reals block encoder
enc: {0, 1}K →RN.
Here we assume that k is divisible by K and that n = N k/K.
If we wish to guess the K-tuple

with the smallest
probability of error, then there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on

Proposition 28.4.2. In addition to the assumptions of Corollary 28.4.1, assume
that X1, . . . , Xn are generated from D1, . . . , Dk in block-mode using a (K, N) binary-
to-reals block encoder. Further assume that the K-tuples in (28.28) are independent.
Then for every ν ∈{1, . . . , k/K}, the N-tuple



D(ν−1)K+1, . . . , DνK

(28.30)
based on (T (1), . . . , T (n)).
Proof. Fix some ν ∈{1, . . . , k/K}.
The statement that the N-tuple (28.29) is
suﬃcient for guessing the K-tuple (28.30) based on the n-tuple (T (1), . . . , T (n)) is
equivalent to the irrelevancy of

T
for guessing the K-tuple (28.30) based on the N-tuple (28.29). To prove this irrele-
vancy, it suﬃces to prove two claims: that R is independent of the K-tuple (28.30)
and that, conditionally on this K-tuple, R is independent of the N-tuple (28.29)
(Proposition 22.6.5). These claims follow from three observations: that, by the
orthonormality assumption (28.23), R is determined by the data bits
D1, . . . , D(ν−1)K, DνK+1, . . . , Dk
(28.31)
and by the random variables
Z1, . . . , Z(ν−1)N, ZνN+1, . . . , Zn;
(28.32)
that the N-tuple (28.29) is determined by the K-tuple (28.30) and by the random
variables
Z(ν−1)N+1, . . . , ZνN;
(28.33)
and that the tuples in (28.30), (28.31), (28.32), and (28.33) are independent.
Having established that the N-tuple (28.29) forms a suﬃcient statistic for guessing
the K-tuple (28.30), it now follows, using arguments very similar to those employed
in proving Proposition 28.3.1, that the N-tuple (28.29) is also suﬃcient for guessing
the value of any function ψ(·) of the K-tuple (28.30).
In combination with Corollary 28.4.1 and Exercise 28.10, Proposition 28.4.2 im-
plies:
Corollary 28.4.3. Under the assumptions of Proposition 28.4.2, no measurable rule
for guessing the value of a function of the K-tuple in (28.30) can outperform an
optimal rule for guessing that value based on the N-tuple in (28.29).

28.4.3
The Discrete-Time Single-Block Model
Corollary 28.4.3 is the starting point of much of the literature on block codes, upon
which we shall touch in Chapter 29. In Coding Theory N is usually called the
blocklength, and K/N is called the rate in bits per dimension. Coding theorists
envision that the function enc(·) is used to map k bits to n real numbers using
the block-encoding rule of Figure 10.1 (with k being divisible by K) and that the
resulting real symbols are then transmitted over a WGN channel using PAM with
a pulse shape satisfying the orthogonality condition (28.23). Assuming that the
data tuples are independent, and by then resorting to Corollary 28.4.3, they then
focus on the problem of decoding the K-tuple (28.30) from the N matched ﬁlter
outputs (28.29).
In this problem the index ν of the block is immaterial, and coding theorists re-
label the data bits of the K tuple (28.30) as D1, . . . , DK; they re-label the symbols
to which they are mapped as X1, . . . , XN; and they re-label the corresponding
observations as Y1, . . . , YN.
The resulting model is the discrete-time single-
block model where

,
η ∈{1, . . . , N},
(28.34c)
and where Z1, . . . , ZN are IID and independent of D1, . . . , DK.
We recall that
this model is appropriate when the pulse shape φ satisﬁes the orthonormality
condition (28.22); the data bits are “block IID” in the sense that the k/K tuples in
(28.28) are independent; and the additive noise is WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2
with respect to the bandwidth occupied by the pulse shape φ. It is customary to
additionally assume that D1, . . . , DK are IID random bits (Deﬁnition 14.5.1). This
is a good assumption if, prior to transmission, the data bits are compressed using
an eﬃcient data compression algorithm.

From a SP to a Random Vector

{gI,ℓ}n

{gQ,ℓ}n

(28.39)
Since these signals are integrable signals that are bandlimited to W Hz around
the carrier frequency fc, it follows (see Section 26.8) that no measurable rule for
guessing D based on

can outperform an optimal rule for guessing D based

We summarize our results on QAM detection in WGN as follows.
Proposition 28.5.1 (Reducing the Output to a Random Vector: QAM in WGN).
Let a QAM signal (28.37) of an integrable pulse shape g(·) that is bandlimited
to W/2 Hz be observed in WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the
bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc. Then:

(ii) Conditional on D = d with corresponding transmitted symbols as is (28.35),

The advantage of the complex notation is that—as we shall see in Proposition 28.5.2
ahead—conditional on D = d, the random vector T−E[T|D = d] is proper (Deﬁ-
nition 17.4.1). And since conditionally on D = d it is also Gaussian, it follows from
Proposition 24.3.11 that, conditional on D = d, the random vector T−E[T|D = d]
is a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian (Deﬁnition 24.3.2). Its conditional law
is thus determined by its conditional covariance matrix (Corollary 24.3.8). This
covariance matrix is an n × n (complex) matrix, whereas the covariance matrix for
the 2n real variables in Proposition 28.5.1 is a (2n) × (2n) (real) matrix.
We summarize our results for QAM detection with complex notation as follows.
Proposition 28.5.2 (A Complex Random Vector for QAM in WGN). Consider
the setup of Proposition 28.5.1.

Proof. Part (i) follows directly from Proposition 28.5.1 because there is a one-to-

mean. Moreover, from Proposition 28.5.1 and from the deﬁnition of a complex
Gaussian random vector as one whose real and imaginary parts are jointly Gaussian
(Deﬁnition 24.3.6), it follows that, conditional on D = d, the vector Z is Gaussian.

tered complex random variables (17.17); the second by (28.50); the third by (28.44);
and the last equality by the conjugate-symmetry of the self-similarity function
(Proposition 11.2.2 (iii)).
Conditional on D = d, the complex n-vector Z is thus a proper Gaussian, and its
conditional law is thus fully speciﬁed by its conditional covariance matrix (Corol-
lary 24.3.8). By (28.51), this conditional covariance matrix does not depend on d,
and we thus conclude that the conditional law of Z conditional on D = d does not
depend on d, i.e., that Z is independent of D.
Part (iii) follows from Part (ii).

Chapter 29
Linear Binary Block Codes with Antipodal
Signaling
29.1
Introduction and Setup
We have thus far said very little about the design of good encoders. We mentioned
block encoders but, apart from deﬁning and studying some of their basic prop-
erties (such as rate and energy per symbol), we have said very little about how
to design such encoders. The design of block encoders falls under the heading of
Coding Theory and is the subject of numerous books such as (MacWilliams and
Sloane, 1977), (van Lint, 1998), (Blahut, 2003), (Roth, 2006) and (Richardson and
Urbanke, 2008). Here we provide only a glimpse of this theory for one class of such
encoders: the class of binary linear block encoders with antipodal pulse amplitude
modulation.
Such encoders map the data bits D1, . . . , DK to the real symbols
X1, . . . , XN by ﬁrst applying a one-to-one linear mapping of binary K-tuples to
binary N-tuples and by then applying the antipodal mapping
0 	→+1
1 	→−1
to each component of the binary N-tuple to produce the {±1}-valued symbols
X1, . . . , XN.
Our emphasis in this chapter is not on the design of such encoders, but on how
their properties inﬂuence the performance of communication systems that employ
them in combination with Pulse Amplitude Modulation. We thus assume that the
transmitted waveform is given by
A

ℓ
Xℓφ(t −ℓTs),
t ∈R,
(29.1)
where A > 0 is a scaling factor, Ts > 0 is the baud period, φ(·) is a real integrable
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz, and where the time shifts of φ(·) by integer
multiples of Ts are orthonormal

Linear Binary Block Codes with Antipodal Signaling
The summation in (29.1) can be ﬁnite, as in the block-mode that we discussed
in Section 10.4, or inﬁnite, as in the bi-inﬁnite block-mode that we discussed in
Section 14.5.2. We shall further assume that the PAM signal is transmitted over
an additive noise channel where the transmitted signal is corrupted by Gaussian
noise that is white with respect to the bandwidth W. We also assume that the
data are IID random bits (Deﬁnition 14.5.1).
In Section 29.2 we brieﬂy discuss the binary ﬁeld F2 and discuss some of the basic
properties of the set of all binary κ-tuples when it is viewed as a vector space
over this ﬁeld. This allows us in Section 29.3 to deﬁne linear binary encoders and
codes. Section 29.4 introduces binary encoders with antipodal signaling, and Sec-
tion 29.5 discusses the power and power spectral density when they are employed
in conjunction with PAM. Section 29.6 begins the study of decoding with a dis-
cussion of two performance criteria: the probability of a block error (also called
message error) and the probability of a bit error. It also recalls the discrete-
time single-block channel model (Section 28.4.3). Section 29.7 contains the design
and performance analysis of the guessing rule that minimizes the probability of a
block error, and Section 29.8 contains a similar analysis for the guessing rule that
minimizes the probability of a bit error. Section 29.9 explains why performance
analysis and simulation are often done under the assumption that the transmitted
data are the all-zero data. Section 29.10 discusses how the encoder and the PAM
parameters inﬂuence the overall system performance. The chapter concludes with
a discussion of the (suboptimal) Hard Decision decoding rule in Section 29.11 and
of bounds on the minimum distance of a code in Section 29.12.

The Binary Field F2 and the Vector Space Fκ
2
29.2.1
The Binary Field F2
The binary ﬁeld F2 consists of two elements that we denote by 0 and 1.
An
operation that we denote by ⊕is deﬁned between any two elements of F2 through
the relation
0 ⊕0 = 0,
0 ⊕1 = 1,
1 ⊕0 = 1,
1 ⊕1 = 0.
(29.3)
This operation is sometimes called “mod 2 addition” or “exclusive-or” or “GF(2)
addition.” (Here GF(2) stands for the Galois Field of two elements after the French
mathematician ´Evariste Galois (1811–1832) who did ground-breaking work on ﬁnite
ﬁelds and groups.) Another operation—“GF(2) multiplication”—is denoted by a
dot and is deﬁned via the relation
0 · 0 = 0,
0 · 1 = 0,
1 · 0 = 0,
1 · 1 = 1.
(29.4)
Combined with these operations, the set F2 forms a ﬁeld, which is sometimes
called the Galois Field of size two. We leave it to the reader to verify that the ⊕
operation satisﬁes
a ⊕b = b ⊕a,
a, b ∈F2,
(a ⊕b) ⊕c = a ⊕(b ⊕c),
a, b, c ∈F2,
a ⊕0 = 0 ⊕a = a,
a ∈F2,

29.2.2
The Vector Field Fκ
2
We denote the set of all binary κ-tuples by Fκ
2 and deﬁne the componentwise-⊕
operation between κ-tuples u =

u1, . . . , uκ

∈Fκ
2 and v =

v1, . . . , vκ


u ⊕v ≜

u1 ⊕v1, . . . , uκ ⊕vκ

,
u, v ∈Fκ
2.
(29.5)
We deﬁne the product between a scalar α ∈F2 and a κ-tuple u =

u1, . . . , uκ

∈Fκ
2
by
α · u ≜

α · u1, . . . , α · uκ

.
(29.6)
With these operations the set Fκ
2 forms a vector space over the ﬁeld F2. The all-zero
κ-tuple is denoted by 0.
29.2.3
Linear Mappings
A mapping T: Fκ
2 →Fη
2 is said to be linear if
T(α · u ⊕β · v) = α · T(u) ⊕β · T(v),

α, β ∈F2, u, v ∈Fκ
2

.
(29.7)
The kernel of a linear mapping T: Fκ
2 →Fη
2 is denoted by ker(T) and is the set of
all κ-tuples in Fκ
2 that are mapped by T(·) to the all-zero η-tuple 0:
ker(T) =

u ∈Fκ
2 : T(u) = 0

.
(29.8)
The kernel of every linear mapping contains the all-zero tuple 0.
The range of T: Fκ
2 →Fη
2 is denoted by range(T) and consists of those elements
of Fη
2 to which some element of Fκ
2 is mapped by T(·):
range(T) =

T(u) : u ∈Fκ
2

.
(29.9)
The key results from Linear Algebra that we need are summarized in the following
proposition.
Proposition 29.2.1. Let T: Fκ
2 →Fη
2 be linear.
(i) The kernel of T(·) is a linear subspace of Fκ
2.
(ii) The mapping T(·) is one-to-one if, and only if, ker(T) = {0}.
(iii) The range of T(·) is a linear subspace of Fη
2.
(iv) The sum of the dimension of the kernel and the dimension of the range space
is equal to the dimension of the domain:
dim

ker(T)

+ dim

range(T)

= κ.
(29.10)
(v) If U is a linear subspace of Fη
2 of dimension κ, then there exists a one-to-one
linear mapping from Fκ
2 to Fη
2 whose range is U.

29.2.4
Hamming Distance and Hamming Weight
The Hamming distance dH(u, v) between two binary κ-tuples u and v is deﬁned
as the number of components in which they diﬀer. For example, the Hamming
distance between the tuples (1, 0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1, 1) is two. It is easy to prove
that for u, v, w ∈Fκ
2:
dH(u, v) ≥0 with equality if, and only if, u = v;
(29.11a)
dH(u, v) = dH(v, u);
(29.11b)
dH(u, w) ≤dH(u, v) + dH(v, w).
(29.11c)
The Hamming weight wH(u) of a binary κ-tuple u is deﬁned as the number of
its nonzero components. Thus,
wH(u) = dH(u, 0),
u ∈Fκ
2,
(29.12)
and
dH(u, v) = wH(u ⊕v),
u, v ∈Fκ
2.
(29.13)
29.2.5
The Componentwise Antipodal Mapping
The antipodal mapping Υ: F2 →{−1, +1} maps the zero element of F2 to the
real number +1 and the unit element of F2 to −1:
Υ(0) = +1,
Υ(1) = −1.
(29.14)
This rule is not as arbitrary as it may seem. Although one might be somewhat
surprised that we do not map 1 ∈F2 to +1, we have our reasons: we prefer the
mapping (29.14) because it maps mod-2 sums to real products. Thus,
Υ(a ⊕b) = Υ(a)Υ(b),
a, b ∈F2,
(29.15)
where the operation on the RHS between Υ(a) and Υ(b) is the regular real-numbers
multiplication. This extends by induction to any ﬁnite number of elements of F2:
Υ

c1 ⊕c2 ⊕· · · ⊕cν

=
ν
@
ℓ=1
Υ(cℓ),
c1, . . . , cν ∈F2.
(29.16)
The componentwise antipodal mapping Υη : Fη
2 →{−1, +1}η maps elements
of Fη
2 to elements of {−1, +1}η by applying the mapping (29.14) to each component:
Υη :

c1, . . . , cη

	→

Υ(c1), . . . , Υ(cη)

.
(29.17)
For example, Υ3 maps the triple (0, 0, 1) to (+1, +1, −1).

29.3 Binary Linear Encoders and Codes

29.2.6
Hamming Distance and Euclidean Distance
We next relate the Hamming distance dH(u, v) between any two binary η-tuples
u = (u1, . . . , uη) and v = (v1, . . . , vη) to the squared Euclidean distance between
the results of applying the componentwise antipodal mapping Υη to them. We
argue that
d2
E

Υη(u), Υη(v)

= 4 dH(u, v),
u, v ∈Fη
2,
(29.18)
where dE(·, ·) denotes the Euclidean distance, so
d2
E

Υη(u), Υη(v)

=
η

ν=1

Υ(uν) −Υ(vν)
2.
(29.19)
To prove (29.18) it suﬃces to consider the case where η = 1, because the Hamming
distance is the sum of the Hamming distances between the respective components,
and likewise for the squared Euclidean distance. To prove this result for η = 1 we
note that if the Hamming distance is zero, then u and v are identical and hence so
are Υ(u) and Υ(v), so the Euclidean distance between them must be zero. And if
the Hamming distance is one, then u ̸= v, and hence Υ(u) and Υ(v) are of opposite
sign but of equal unit magnitude, so the squared Euclidean distance between them
is four.
29.3
Binary Linear Encoders and Codes
Deﬁnition 29.3.1 (Linear (K, N) F2 Encoder and Code). Let N and K be positive
integers.
(i) A linear (K, N) F2 encoder is a one-to-one linear mapping from FK
2 to FN
2 .
(ii) A linear (K, N) F2 code is a linear subspace of FN
2 of dimension K.1
In both deﬁnitions N is called the blocklength and K is called the dimension.
For example, the (K, K + 1) systematic single parity check encoder is the
mapping

d1, . . . , dK

	→

d1, . . . , dK, d1 ⊕d2 ⊕· · · ⊕dK

.
(29.20)
It appends to the data tuple a single bit that is chosen so that the resulting (K+1)-
tuple be of even Hamming weight. The (K, K+1) single parity check code is the
subset of FK+1
2
consisting of those binary (K + 1)-tuples whose Hamming weight is
even.
Recall that the range of a mapping g: A →B is the subset of B comprising those
elements y ∈B to which there corresponds some x ∈A such that g(x) = y.
1The terminology here is not standard. In the Coding Theory literature a linear (K, N) F2
code is often called a “binary linear [N, K] code.”

Linear Binary Block Codes with Antipodal Signaling
Proposition 29.3.2 (F2 Encoders and Codes).
(i) If T: FK
2 →FN
2 is a linear (K, N) F2 encoder, then its range is a linear (K, N)
F2 code.
(ii) Every linear (K, N) F2 code is the range of some (nonunique) linear (K, N)
F2 encoder.
Proof. We begin with Part (i). Let T: FK
2 →FN
2 be a linear (K, N) F2 encoder.
That its range is a linear subspace of FN
2
follows from Proposition 29.2.1 (iii).
That its dimension must be K follows from Proposition 29.2.1 (iv) (see (29.10))
because the fact that T(·) is one-to-one implies, by Proposition 29.2.1 (ii), that
ker(T) = {0} so dim

ker(T)

= 0.
To prove Part (ii) we note that FK
2 is of dimension K and that, by deﬁnition, every
linear (K, N) F2 code is also of dimension K. The result now follows by noting
that there exists a one-to-one linear mapping between any two subspaces of equal
dimensions over the same ﬁeld (Proposition 29.2.1 (v)).
Any linear transformation from a ﬁnite-dimensional space to a ﬁnite-dimensional
space can be represented as matrix multiplication. A linear (K, N) F2 encoder is
no exception. What is perhaps unusual is that coding theorists use row vectors
to denote the data K-tuples and the N-tuples to which they are mapped. They
consequently use matrix multiplication from the left. This tradition is so ingrained
that we shall begrudgingly adopt it.
Deﬁnition 29.3.3 (Matrix Representation of an Encoder). We say that the linear
(K, N) F2 encoder T: FK
2 →FN
2 is represented by the generator matrix G if G
is a K × N matrix whose elements are in F2 and
T(d) = dG,
d ∈FK
2 .
(29.21)
Note that in the matrix multiplication in (29.21) we use F2 arithmetic, so the η-th
component of dG is d(1)·g(1,η)⊕· · ·⊕d(K)·g(K,η), where g(κ,η) is the Row-κ Column-η
component of the generator matrix G, and where d(κ) is the κ-th component of d.
For example, the (K, K + 1) F2 systematic single parity check encoder (29.20) is
represented by the K × (K + 1) generator matrix

(29.22)
The generator matrix G in (29.21) is uniquely speciﬁed by the linear transformation
T(·): its η-th row is the result of applying T(·) to the K-tuple (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0)
(the K-tuple whose components are all zero except for the η-th, which is one).

29.3 Binary Linear Encoders and Codes
713
Moreover, every K × N binary matrix G deﬁnes a linear transformation T(·) via
(29.21), but this linear transformation need not be one-to-one. It is one-to-one if,
and only if, the subspace of FN
2 spanned by the rows of G is of dimension K.
Deﬁnition 29.3.4 (Generator Matrix). A matrix G is a generator matrix for a
given linear (K, N) F2 code if G is a binary K × N matrix such that the range of
the mapping d 	→dG is the given code.
Note that there may be numerous generator matrices for a given code. For example,
the matrix (29.22) is a generator matrix for the single parity check code.
But
there are others. Indeed, replacing any row of the above matrix by the sum of
that row and another diﬀerent row results in another generator matrix for this
code. Likewise, swapping two rows of a generator matrix for a code yields another
generator matrix for the code.
Coding theorists like to distinguish between a code property and an encoder
property.
Code properties are properties that are common to all encoders of
the same range. Encoder properties are speciﬁc to an encoder. Examples of code
properties are the blocklength and dimension. We shall soon encounter more. An
example of an encoder property is the property of being systematic:
Deﬁnition 29.3.5 (Systematic Encoder). A linear (K, N) F2 encoder T: FK
2 →FN
2
is said to be systematic (or strictly systematic) if, for every K-tuple

d1, . . . , dK

in FK
2 , the ﬁrst K components of T

(d1, . . . , dK)

are equal to d1, . . . , dK.
For example, the encoder (29.20) is systematic. An encoder whose range is the
single-parity check code and which is not systematic is the encoder

d1, . . . , dK

	→

d1, d1 ⊕d2, d2 ⊕d3, . . . , dK−1 ⊕dK, dK

.
(29.23)
The reader is encouraged to verify that if a linear (K, N) F2 encoder T: FK
2 →FN
2
is represented by the matrix G, then T(·) is systematic if, and only if, the K × K
matrix that results from deleting the last N −K columns of G is the K × K identity
matrix.
Deﬁnition 29.3.6 (Parity-Check Matrix). A parity-check matrix for a given
linear (K, N) F2 code is a binary matrix H with N columns such that a (row) N-
tuple c is in the code if, and only if, cHT is the all-zero (row) vector.
For example, a parity-check matrix for the (K, K + 1) single-parity check code is
the 1 × (K + 1) matrix
H = (1, 1, . . . , 1).
(Codes typically have numerous diﬀerent parity-check matrices, but the single-
parity check code is an exception.)

Linear Binary Block Codes with Antipodal Signaling
29.4
Binary Encoders with Antipodal Signaling
Deﬁnition 29.4.1.
(i) We say that a (K, N) binary-to-reals block encoder enc: {0, 1}K →RN is a
linear binary (K, N) block encoder with antipodal signaling if
enc(d) = ΥN

T(d)

,
d ∈FK
2 ,
(29.24)
where T: FK
2 →FN
2 is a linear (K, N) F2 encoder, and where ΥN(·) is the
componentwise antipodal mapping (29.17). Thus, if (X1, . . . , XN) denotes
the N-tuple produced by enc(·) when fed the data K-tuple (D1, . . . , DK), then
Xη =

+1
if the η-th components of T

(D1, . . . , DK)

is zero,
−1
otherwise.
(29.25)
(ii) A linear binary (K, N) block code with antipodal signaling is the range
of some linear binary (K, N) block encoder with antipodal signaling.
In analogy to Proposition 29.3.2, the range of every linear binary (K, N) block
encoder with antipodal signaling is a linear binary (K, N) block code with antipodal
signaling.
If enc(·) can be represented by the application of T(·) to the data K-tuple followed
by the application of the componentwise antipodal mapping ΥN, then we shall
write
enc = ΥN ◦T.
(29.26)
Since ΥN is invertible, there is a one-to-one correspondence between T and enc.
An important code property is the distribution of the result of applying an encoder
to IID random bits.
Proposition 29.4.2. Let T: FK
2 →FN
2 be a linear (K, N) F2 encoder.
(i) Applying T to a K-tuple of IID random bits results in a random N-tuple that
is uniformly distributed over range(T).
(ii) Applying ΥN ◦T to IID random bits produces an N-tuple that is uniformly
distributed over the range of range(T) under the componentwise antipodal
mapping ΥN.
Proof. Part (i) follows from the fact that the mapping T(·) is one-to-one. Part (ii)
follows from Part (i) and from the fact that ΥN(·) is one-to-one.
For example, it follows from Proposition 29.4.2 (ii) and from (29.16) that if we

29.5 Power and Operational Power Spectral Density
715
Corollary 29.4.3. Any property that is determined by the joint distribution of the
result of applying the encoder to IID random bits is a code property.
Examples of such properties are the power and operational power spectral density,
which are discussed next.
29.5
Power and Operational Power Spectral Density
To discuss the transmitted power and the operational power spectral density we
shall consider bi-inﬁnite block encoding (Section 14.5.2). We shall then use the
results of Section 14.5.2 and Section 15.4.3 to compute the power and operational
PSD of the transmitted signal in this mode.
The impatient reader who is only interested in the transmitted power for pulse
shapes satisfying the orthogonality condition (29.2) can apply the results of Sec-
tion 14.5.3 directly to obtain that, subject to the decay condition (14.46), the
transmitted power P is given by
P = A2
Ts
.
(29.27)
We next extend the discussion to general pulse shapes and to the operational PSD.
To remind the reader that we no longer assume the orthogonality condition (29.2),
we shall now denote the pulse shape by g(·) and assume that it is bandlimited
to W Hz and that it satisﬁes the decay condition (14.17). Before proceeding with
the analysis of the power and PSD, we wish to characterize linear binary (K, N)
block encoders with antipodal signaling that map IID random bits to zero-mean
N-tuples. Note that by Corollary 29.4.3 this is, in fact, a code property. Thus, if
enc = ΥN ◦T, then the question of whether enc(·) maps IID random bits to zero-
mean N-tuples depends only on the range of T. Aiding us in this characterization
is the following lemma on linear functionals. A linear functional on Fκ
2 is a linear
mapping from Fκ
2 to F2. The zero functional maps every κ-tuple in Fκ
2 to zero.
Lemma 29.5.1. Let L: FK
2 →F2 be a linear functional that is not the zero func-
tional. Then the RV X deﬁned by

if L

is the set of all K-tuples in FK
2 that are mapped by L(·) to 0, where L−1(1) is anal-
ogously deﬁned, and where # A denotes the number of elements in the set A. It
follows that to prove that E[X] = 0 it suﬃces to show that if L(·) is not determin-
istically zero, then the sets L−1(0) and L−1(1) have the same number of elements.
We prove this by exhibiting a one-to-one mapping from L−1(0) onto L−1(1). (If
there is a one-to-one mapping from a ﬁnite set A onto a ﬁnite set B, then A and B
must have the same number of elements.) To exhibit this mapping, note that the
assumption that L(·) is not the zero transformation implies that the set L−1(1) is
not empty. Let d∗be an element of this set, so
L(d∗) = 1.
(29.29)
The required mapping maps each d0 ∈L−1(0) to d0 ⊕d∗:
L−1(0) ∋d0 	→d0 ⊕d∗.
(29.30)
We next verify that it is a one-to-one mapping from L−1(0) onto L−1(1). That it is
one-to-one follows because if d0 ⊕d∗= d′
0 ⊕d∗then by adding d∗to both sides we
obtain d0 ⊕d∗⊕d∗= d′
0 ⊕d∗⊕d∗, i.e., that d0 = d′
0 (because d∗⊕d∗= 0). That
this mapping maps each element of L−1(0) to an element of L−1(1) follows because,
as we next show, if d0 ∈L−1(0), then L(d0 ⊕d∗) = 1. Indeed, if d0 ∈L−1(0), then
L(d0) = 0,
(29.31)
and consequently,
L(d0 ⊕d∗) = L(d0) ⊕L(d∗)
= 0 ⊕1
= 1,
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the linearity of L(·), and where the second
equality follows from (29.29) and (29.31). That the mapping is onto follows by
noting that if d1 is any element of L−1(1), then d1 ⊕d∗is in L−1(0) and it is
mapped by this mapping to d1.
Using this lemma we can show:
Proposition 29.5.2. Let (X1, . . . , XN) be the result of applying a linear binary
(K, N) block encoder with antipodal signaling to a binary K-tuple comprising IID
random bits.

(ii) For every η, η′ ∈{1, . . . , N}, the random variables Xη and Xη′ are either
deterministically equal to each other or else E[XηXη′] = 0.
Proof. Let the linear binary (K, N) block encoder with antipodal signaling enc(·)
be given by enc = ΥN ◦T, where T: FK
2 →FN
2 is one-to-one and linear. Let
(X1, . . . , XN) be the result of applying enc to the K-tuple D = (D1, . . . , DK),
where D1, . . . , DK are IID random bits.
To prove Part (i), ﬁx some η ∈{1, . . . , N}, and let L(·) be the linear functional that
maps d to the η-th component of T(d), so Xη = Υ

L(D)

, where D denotes the
row vector comprising the K IID random bits. If L(·) maps all data K-tuples to zero,
then Xη is deterministically equal to +1. Otherwise, E[Xη] = 0 by Lemma 29.5.1.
To prove Part (ii), let the matrix G represent the mapping T(·), so Xη = Υ

DG(·,η)
,
where G(·,η) denotes the η-th column of G. Expressing Xη′ in a similar way, we

Consequently, if we deﬁne the linear functional L: d 	→d

G(·,η) ⊕G(·,η′)
, then
XηXη′ = Υ

L(D)

. This linear functional is the zero functional if the η-th column
of G is identical to its η′-th column, i.e., if Xη is deterministically equal to Xη′.
Otherwise, it is not the zero functional, and E[XηXη′]

Proposition 29.5.3 (Producing Zero-Mean Uncorrelated Symbols). A linear bi-
nary (K, N) block encoder with antipodal signaling enc = ΥN ◦T produces zero-
mean uncorrelated symbols when fed IID random bits if, and only if, the columns
of the matrix G representing T(·) are distinct and neither of these columns is the
all-zero column.
Proof. The η-th symbol Xη produced by enc = ΥN ◦T when fed the K-tuple of
IID random bits D = (D1, . . . , DK) is given by

is the zero functional if, and only if,
G(1,η) = · · · = G(K,η) = 0,

it follows that Xη is deterministically zero if, and only if, the η-th column of G is
zero. From this and Lemma 29.5.1 it follows that all the symbols produced by enc
are of zero mean if, and only if, none of the columns of G is zero.
A similar argument shows that the product XηXη′, which by (29.32) is given by

is deterministically zero if, and only if, the functional
d 	→d1 · (G(1,η) ⊕G(1,η′)) ⊕· · · ⊕dK · (G(K,η) ⊕G(K,η′))
is zero, i.e., if, and only if, the η-th and η′-th columns of G are equal. Otherwise,
by Lemma 29.5.1, we have E[XηXη′] = 0.
Note 29.5.4. By Corollary 29.4.3 the property of producing zero-mean uncorre-
lated symbols is a code property.
Proposition 29.5.5 (Power and PSD). Let the linear binary (K, N) block encoder
with antipodal signaling enc = ΥN ◦T produce zero-mean uncorrelated symbols
when fed IID random bits, and let the pulse shape g satisfy the decay condition
(14.17). Then the transmitted power P in bi-inﬁnite block-encoding mode is given
by
P = A2

(29.34)
and the operational PSD is
SXX(f) = A2
Ts
ˆg(f)
2,
f ∈R.
(29.35)
Proof. The expression (29.34) for the power follows either from (14.33) or (14.38).
The expression for the operational PSD follows either from (15.23) or from (15.26).
Engineers rarely check whether an encoder produces uncorrelated symbols when
fed IID random bits. The reason may be that they usually deal with pulse shapes
φ satisfying the orthogonality condition (29.2) and the decay condition (14.46).
For such pulse shapes, the power is given by (29.27) without any additional as-
sumptions. Also, by Theorem 15.4.1, the bandwidth of the PAM signal is typically
equal to the bandwidth of the pulse shape. In fact, by that theorem, for linear
binary (K, N) block encoders with antipodal signaling
bandwidth of PAM signal = bandwidth of pulse shape,
(29.36)
whenever A ̸= 0; the pulse shape g is a Borel measurable function satisfying the
decay condition (14.17) for some α, β > 0; and the encoder produces zero-mean

29.6 Performance Criteria

symbols when fed IID random bits. Thus, if one is not interested in the exact form
of the operational PSD but only in its support, then one need not check whether
the encoder produces uncorrelated symbols when fed IID random bits.
29.6
Performance Criteria
Designing an optimal decoder for linear binary block encoders with antipodal sig-
naling is conceptually very simple but algorithmically very diﬃcult. The structure
of the decoder depends on what we mean by “optimal.” In this chapter we focus
on two notions of optimality: minimizing the probability of a block error—also
called message error—and minimizing the probability of a bit error. Referring
to Figure 28.1, we say that a block error occurred in decoding the ν-th block if
at least one of the data bits

D(ν−1)K+1, . . . , D(ν−1)K+K

was incorrectly decoded.
We say that a bit error occurred in decoding the j-th bit if Dj was incorrectly
decoded.
We consider the case where IID random bits are transmitted in block-mode, and
the transmitted waveform is corrupted by additive Gaussian noise that is white
with respect to the bandwidth W of the pulse shape. The pulse shape is assumed
to satisfy the orthonormality condition (29.2) and the decay condition (14.17).
From Proposition 28.3.1 it follows that for both optimality criteria, there is no
loss of optimality in feeding the received waveform to a matched ﬁlter for φ and
in basing the decision on the ﬁlter’s output sampled at integer multiples of Ts.
Moreover, for the purposes of decoding a given message, it suﬃces to consider only
the samples corresponding to the symbols that were produced when the encoder
encoded the given message (Proposition 28.4.2). Similarly, for decoding a given
data bit it suﬃces to consider only the samples corresponding to the symbols that
were produced when the encoder encoded the message of which the given bit is part.
These observations lead us (as in Section 28.4.3) to the discrete-time single-block
model (28.34). For convenience, we repeat this model here (with the additional
assumption that the data are IID random bits):

Minimizing the Block Error Rate
29.7.1
Optimal Decoding
To minimize the probability of a block error, we need to use the random N-vector
Y = (Y1, . . . , YN) to guess the K-tuple D =

D1, . . . , DK

. This is the type of
problem we addressed in Section 21.6. The translation between the setup of that
section and our current setup is summarized in Table 29.1: the number of observa-
tions, which was there J, is here N; the number of hypotheses, which was there M,
is here 2K; the set of possible messages, which was there M = {1, . . . , M}, is here
the set of binary K-tuples FK
2 ; the dummy variable for a generic message, which
was there m, is here the binary K-tuple d; the prior, which was there {πm}, is
here uniform; the mean tuple corresponding to the m-th message, which was there


Ax1(d), . . . , AxN(d)

(see (29.38)); and the conditional
variance of each observation, which was there σ2, is here N0/2.
Because all the symbols produced by the encoder take value in {−1, +1}, it follows
that

so all the mean tuples are of equal Euclidean norm. From Proposition 21.6.1 (iii)

with ties being resolved uniformly at random among the data tuples that achieve
the maximum. Our guess should thus be the data sequence that when fed to the
encoder produces the {±1}-valued N-tuple of highest correlation with the observed
tuple Y.
Note that, by deﬁnition, all block encoders are one-to-one mappings
and thus the mean tuples are distinct. Consequently, by Proposition 21.6.2, the
probability that more than one tuple d∗satisﬁes (29.41) is zero.
Since guessing the data tuple is equivalent to guessing the N-tuple to which it is
mapped, we can also describe the optimal decision rule in terms of the encoder’s
output.
Proposition 29.7.1 (The Max-Correlation Decision Rule). Consider the problem
of guessing D based on Y for the setup of Section 29.6.

tuple from the set

(29.43)
minimizes the probability of error. This set contains more than one element
with probability zero.
Conceptually, the problem of ﬁnding an N-tuple that has the highest correlation
with (Y1, . . . , YN) among all the N-tuples in the range of enc(·) is very simple: one
goes over the list of all the 2K N-tuples that are in the range of enc(·) and picks
the one that has the highest correlation with (Y1, . . . , YN). But algorithmically
this is very diﬃcult because 2K is in most applications a huge number. It is one of
the challenges of Coding Theory to come up with encoders for which the decoding
does not require an exhaustive search over all 2K tuples.
As we shall see, the
single parity check code is an example of such a code. But the performance of this
encoder is, alas, not stellar.
29.7.2
Wagner’s Rule
For the (K, K + 1) systematic single parity check encoder (29.20), the decoding can
be performed very eﬃciently using a decision algorithm that is called Wagner’s
Rule in honor of C.A. Wagner. Unlike the brute-force approach that considers all
possible data tuples and which thus has a complexity which is exponential in K,
the complexity of Wagner’s Rule is linear in K.

722
Linear Binary Block Codes with Antipodal Signaling
Wagner’s Rule can be summarized as follows. Consider the (K + 1) tuple
ξη ≜

+1
if Yη ≥0,
−1
otherwise,
η = 1, . . . , K + 1.
(29.44)
If this tuple has an even number of negative components, then guess that the en-
coder’s output is (ξ1, . . . , ξK+1) and that the data sequence is thus the inverse of
(ξ1, . . . , ξK) under the componentwise antipodal mapping ΥK, i.e., that the data
tuple is (1 −ξ1)/2, . . . , (1 −ξK)/2. Otherwise, ﬂip the sign of ξη∗corresponding to
the Yη∗of smallest magnitude. I.e., guess that the encoder’s output is
ξ1, . . . , ξη∗−1, −ξη∗, ξη∗+1 . . . , ξK+1,
(29.45)
and that the data bits are
1 −ξ1
2
, . . . , 1 −ξη∗−1
2
, 1 + ξη∗
2
, 1 −ξη∗+1
2
. . . , 1 −ξK
2
,
(29.46)
where η∗is the element of {1, . . . , K + 1} satisfying
|Yη∗| =
min
1≤η≤K+1 |Yη|.
(29.47)
Proof that Wagner’s Rule is Optimal. Recall that the (K, K + 1) single parity
check code with antipodal signaling consists of all ±1-valued (K + 1)-tuples having
an even number of −1’s. We seek to ﬁnd the tuple that among all such tuples max-
imizes the correlation with the received tuple (Y1, . . . , YK+1). The tuple deﬁned in
(29.44) is the tuple that among all tuples in {−1, +1}K+1 has the highest correla-
tion with (Y1, . . . , YK+1). Since ﬂipping the sign of ξη reduces the correlation by
2|Yη|, the tuple (29.45) has the second-highest correlation among all the tuples in
{−1, +1}K+1. Since the tuples (29.44) and (29.45) diﬀer in one component, exactly
one of them has an even number of negative components. That tuple thus maxi-
mizes the correlation among all tuples in {−1, +1}K+1 that have an even number
of negative components and is thus the tuple we are after.
Since the encoder is systematic, the data tuple that generates a given encoder
output is easily found by considering the ﬁrst K components of the encoder output
and by then applying the mapping +1 	→0 and −1 	→1, i.e., ξ 	→(1 −ξ)/2.
29.7.3
The Probability of a Block Error
We next address the performance of the detector that we designed in Section 29.7.1
when we sought to minimize the probability of a block error. We continue to assume
that the encoder is a linear binary (K, N) block encoder with antipodal signaling,
so the encoder function enc(·) can be written as enc = ΥN ◦T where T: FK
2 →FN
2
is a linear one-to-one mapping and ΥN(·) is the componentwise antipodal mapping.

An Upper Bound
It is usually very diﬃcult to precisely evaluate the probability of a block error. A
very useful bound is the Union Bound, which we encountered in Section 21.6.3.
Denoting by pMAP(error|D = d) the probability of error of our guessing rule con-
ditional on the binary K-tuple D = d being fed to the encoder, we can use (21.60),
Table 29.1, and (29.18) to obtain

29.8
Minimizing the Bit Error Rate
In some applications we want to minimize the number of data bits that are incor-
rectly decoded. This performance criterion leads to a diﬀerent guessing rule, which
we derive and analyze in this section.
29.8.1
Optimal Decoding
We next derive the guessing rule that minimizes the average probability of a bit
error, or the Bit Error Rate. Conceptually, this is simple. For each κ ∈{1, . . . , K}
our guess of the κ-th data bit Dκ should minimize the probability of error. This
problem falls under the category of binary hypothesis testing, and, since Dκ is a
priori equally likely to be 0 or 1, the Maximum-Likelihood rule of Section 20.8 is
optimal. To compute the likelihood-ratio function, we treat the other data bits
D1, . . . , Dκ−1, Dκ+1, . . . , DK as unobserved random parameters (Section 20.15.1).
Thus, using (20.101) with the random parameter Θ now corresponding to the tuple
(D1, . . . , Dκ−1, Dκ+1, . . . , DK) we obtain2
fY|Dκ=0(y1, . . . , yN)
= 2−(K−1)

d∈Aκ,0

and that guesses at random in case of equality minimizes the probability of guessing
the data bit Dκ incorrectly.
The diﬃculty in implementing this decision rule is that, unless we exploit some
algebraic structure, the computation of the sums above has exponential complexity
in K, because the number of terms in each sum is 2K−1.
It is interesting to note that, unlike the decision rule that minimizes the probability
of a block error, the above decision rule depends on the value of N0/2.
29.8.2
The Probability of a Bit Error
We next obtain bounds on the probability that the detector of Proposition 29.8.1
errs in guessing the κ-th data bit Dκ. We denote this probability by p∗
κ.
An Upper Bound
Since the detector of Proposition 29.8.1 is optimal, the probability that it errs
in decoding the κ-th data bit Dκ cannot exceed the probability of error of the
suboptimal rule whose guess for Dκ is the κ-th bit of the message produced by the
detector of Section 29.7. Thus, if φMAP(·) denotes the decision rule of Section 29.7,
then

Assuming the All-Zero Codeword
When simulating linear binary block encoders with antipodal signaling over the
Gaussian channel we rarely simulate the data as IID random bits.
Instead we
assume that the message that is fed to the encoder is the all-zero message and that
the encoder’s output is hence the N-tuple whose components are all +1. In this
section we shall explain why it is correct to do so. More speciﬁcally, we shall show
that pMAP(error|D = d) does not depend on the message d and is thus equal to
pMAP(error|D = 0). We shall also prove an analogous result for the decoder that

Part (iii) follows from Parts (i) and (ii). Part (iv) follows from Part (iii) or di-
rectly by computing the partial derivative matrix and noting that it is diagonal
with the diagonal elements being ±1 only. Part (v) follows from (29.75). To prove

With the aid of this lemma we can now justify the all-zero assumption in the
analysis of the probability of a block error. We shall state the result not only for
the Gaussian setup but also for the more general case where the conditional den-
sity fY|X(·) corresponds to a memoryless binary-input/output-symmetric channel.
Theorem 29.9.3. Consider the setup of Section 29.6 with the conditional den-
sity fY|X(·) corresponding to a memoryless binary-input/output-symmetric chan-
nel. Let pMAP(error|D = d) denote the conditional probability of a block error for
the detector of Proposition 29.7.1, conditional on the data tuple being d. Then,
pMAP(error|D = d) = pMAP(error|D = 0),
d ∈FK
2 .
(29.82)
Proof. The proof of this result is not very diﬃcult, but there is a slight technicality
that arises from the way ties are resolved. Since on the Gaussian channel ties occur
with probability zero (Proposition 21.6.2), this issue could be ignored. But we
prefer not to ignore it because we would like the proof to apply also to channels
satisfying (29.76) that are not necessarily Gaussian.

assume that they are resolved at random as in Proposition 29.7.1 (i.e., as in the
Deﬁnition 21.3.2 of the MAP rule).
For every d ∈FK

those y ∈RN for which the following two conditions hold:

29.10
System Parameters
We next summarize how the system parameters such as power, bandwidth, and
block error rate are related to the parameters of the encoder. We only address the
case where the pulse shape φ satisﬁes the orthonormality condition (29.2). As we
next show, in this case the bandwidth W in Hz of the pulse shape can be expressed
as
W = 1
2 Rb
N
K (1 + excess bandwidth),
(29.92)
where Rb is the bit rate at which the data are fed to the modem in bits per
second, and where the excess bandwidth, which is deﬁned in Deﬁnition 11.3.6, is
nonnegative. To verify (29.92) note that if the data arrive at the encoder at the
rate of Rb bits per second and if the encoder produces N real symbols for every K
bits that are fed to it, then the encoder produces real symbols at a rate
Rs = N
K Rb
real symbol
second

,
(29.93)
so the baud period must be
Ts = K
N
1
Rb
.
(29.94)
It then follows from Deﬁnition 11.3.6 that the bandwidth of φ is given by (29.92)
with the excess bandwidth being nonnegative by Corollary 11.3.5.

29.11 Hard vs. Soft Decisions
735
As to the transmitted power P, by (29.27) and (29.94) it is given by
P = Eb Rb,
(29.95)
where Eb denotes the energy per data bit and is given by
Eb = N
K A2.
(29.96)
It is customary to describe the error probability by which one measures performance
as a function of the energy-per-bit Eb.3 Thus, for example, one typically writes the
upper bound (29.55) on the probability of a block error using (29.96) as
pMAP(error|D = d)

⎞
⎠.
(29.97)
29.11
Hard vs. Soft Decisions
In Section 29.7 we derived the decision rule that minimizes the probability of a block
error. We saw that, in general, its complexity is exponential in the dimension K of
the code because a brute-force implementation of this rule requires correlating the
N-tuple Y with each of the 2K tuples in range(enc). For the single parity check
rule we found a much simpler implementation of this rule, but for general codes
the decoding problem can be very diﬃcult.
A suboptimal decoding rule that is sometimes implemented is the Hard Decision
decoding rule, which has two steps. In the ﬁrst step one uses the observed real-
valued N-tuple (Y1, . . . , YN) to form the binary tuple ( ˆC1, . . . , ˆCN) according to
the rule
ˆCη =

0
if Yη ≥0,
1
if Yη < 0,
η = 1, . . . , N,
and in the second step one searches for the message d for which T(d) is closest in
Hamming distance to ( ˆC1, . . . , ˆCN). The advantage of this decoding rule is that
the ﬁrst step is very simple and that the second step can be often performed very
eﬃciently if the code has a strong algebraic structure.

The Varshamov and Singleton Bounds
Motivated by the approximation (29.56) and by (29.58), a fair bit of eﬀort in
Coding Theory has been invested in ﬁnding (K, N) codes that have a large minimum
Hamming weight and reasonable decoding complexity. One of the key existence

results in this area is the Varshamov Bound. We state here a special case of this
bound pertaining to our binary setting.
Theorem 29.12.1 (The Varshamov Bound). Let K and N be positive integers,
and let d be an integer in the range 2 ≤d ≤N −K + 1. If
d−2

ν=0
	N −1
ν

< 2N−K,
(29.98)
then there exists a linear (K, N) F2 code whose minimum distance dmin,H satisﬁes
dmin,H ≥d.
Proof. See, for example, (MacWilliams and Sloane, 1977, Chapter 1, Section 10,
Theorem 12) or (Blahut, 2003, Chapter 12, Section 3, Theorem 12.3.3).
A key upper bound on dmin,H is given by the Singleton Bound.
Theorem 29.12.2 (The Singleton Bound). If N and K are positive integers, then
the minimum Hamming distance dmin,H of any linear (K, N) F2 code must satisfy
dmin,H ≤N −K + 1.
(29.99)
Proof. See, for example, (Blahut, 2003, Chapter 3, Section 3, Theorem 3.2.6) or
(van Lint, 1998, Chapter 5, Section 2, Corollary 5.2.2) or Exercise 29.11.

Additional Reading
We have only had a glimpse of Coding Theory.
A good starting point for the
literature on Algebraic Coding Theory is (Roth, 2006). For more on the modern
coding techniques such as low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) and turbo-codes,
see (Richardson and Urbanke, 2008) and (Ryan and Lin, 2009).
For more bounds on the error probabilities, see (Sason and Shamai, 2006).
The degradation resulting from hard decisions is addressed, e.g., in (Viterbi and
Omura, 1979, Chapter 3, Section 3.4).
The results of Section 29.9 can be extended also to nonbinary codes with other
mappings. See, for example, (Loeliger, 1991) and (Forney, 1991).
For some of the literature on the minimum distance and its asymptotic behavior
in the block length, see, for example, (Roth, 2006, Chapter 4)
For more on the decoding complexity see the notes on Section 2.4 in Chapter 2 of
(Roth, 2006).

Chapter 30
The Radar Problem
The radar problem is to guess whether an observed waveform is noise or a signal
corrupted by noise.
In its simplest form, the signal—which corresponds to the
reﬂection from a target—is deterministic. In the more general setting of a moving
target at an unknown distance or velocity, some of the signal’s parameters (e.g.,
delay or phase) are either unknown or random.
Unlike the hypothesis-testing problem that we encountered in Chapter 20, here
there is no prior. Consequently, it is meaningless to discuss the probability of er-
ror, and a new optimality criterion must be introduced. Typically one wishes to
minimize the probability of missed-detection (guessing “no target” in its presence)
subject to a constraint on the maximal probability of false alarm (guessing “tar-
get” when none is present). More generally, one studies the trade-oﬀbetween the
probability of false alarm and the probability of missed-detection.
There are many other scenarios where one needs to guess in the absence of a prior,
e.g., in guessing whether a drug is helpful against some ailment or in guessing
whether there is a housing bubble. Consequently, although we shall refer to our
problem as “the radar problem,” we shall pose it in greater generality.
The radar problem is closely related to the Knapsack Problem in Computer
Science. This relation is explored in Section 30.2.
Readers who prefer to work on their jigsaw puzzle after peeking at the picture on
the box should—as recommended—glance at Section 30.11 (without the proofs and
referring to Deﬁnition 30.5.1 if they must) after reading about the setup and the
connection with the Knapsack Problem (Sections 30.1–30.2) and before proceeding
to Section 30.3. Others can read in the order in which the results are derived.
30.1
The Setup
Two probability density functions f0(·) and f1(·) on the d-dimensional Euclidean
space Rd are given. A random vector Y is drawn according to one of them, and
our task is to guess according to which. We refer to Y as the observation and to
the space Rd, which we denote by Y, as the observation space. We refer to the
hypothesis that Y was drawn according to f0(·) as the null hypothesis. In the
radar problem this corresponds to the hypothesis that no target is present and that
740

15:01:42, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

30.1 The Setup
741
we are therefore observing only noise; the other hypothesis—the alternative—
corresponds to the hypothesis that a target is present.
A (deterministic) guessing rule is speciﬁed by a (Borel measurable) mapping
φGuess : Y →{0, 1}
(30.1)
as follows. Having observed that Y = yobs, our guess is determined by φGuess(yobs):
if φGuess(yobs) is 0, then we guess that Y was drawn according to f0(·), and oth-
erwise we guess that it was drawn according to f1(·). We refer to guessing that Y
was drawn according to f0(·) as guessing “H = 0,” and to guessing that it was
drawn according to f1(·) as guessing “H = 1.” The mapping φGuess(·)—and hence
also the guess—can also be speciﬁed in terms of the subset D ⊆Y that it maps to
zero
D =

y ∈Y : φGuess(y) = 0

.
(30.2)
The event that we guess that Y was drawn according to f1(·) when it was in fact
drawn according to f0(·) is called a false alarm, because it corresponds to the
event that we erroneously guess that a target is present. The probability pFA of
this event is
pFA =

{y∈Y : φGuess(y)=1}
f0(y) dy
(30.3a)
=

Dc f0(y) dy
(30.3b)
=

Y
f0(y) I{y ∈Dc} dy,
(30.3c)
where in the second equality we have used (30.2).
The other error event of guessing that Y was drawn according to f0(·) when it was
in fact drawn according to f1(·) is called a missed-detection, because it corre-
sponds to the event that we fail to detect that a target is present. Its probability
pMD is
pMD =

{y∈Y : φGuess(y)=0}
f1(y) dy
(30.4a)
=

D
f1(y) dy
(30.4b)
=

Y
f1(y) I{y ∈D} dy.

Rather than specifying the missed-detection probability, it is more common in the
radar community to specify the probability of detection pD, which is deﬁned as
pD = 1 −pMD.

The Radar Problem
We would like the probability of detection to be high and the probability of false
alarm to be small, but there is a tension between these objectives. This tension is
best seen by comparing (30.6) with (30.3c): for pD to be large, the set Dc should
be “large” so that the integral in (30.6) be large; but for pFA to be small, the same
set Dc should be “small” so that the integral in (30.3c) be small. Stated diﬀerently,
by including an inﬁnitesimal region around y in Dc we increase pD by f1(y) dy,
but at the cost of increasing pFA by f0(y) dy. The radar problem is to study the
trade-oﬀbetween pD and pFA and to identify the guessing rules that achieve the
best trade-oﬀ.
We say that a pair (pFA, pMD) is achievable if there exists a decision rule of these
probabilities of false alarm and missed-detection. The set of all achievable pairs is
denoted R. We say that a pair (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) is Pareto-optimal if it is achievable
and there does not exist a “better” achievable pair. More precisely, (p∗
FA, p∗
MD)
is Pareto-optimal if it is achievable and there does not exist an achievable pair
(p′
FA, p′
MD) satisfying both p′
FA < p∗
FA and p′
MD ≤p∗
MD nor an achievable pair
(p′
FA, p′
MD) satisfying both p′
FA ≤p∗
FA and p′
MD < p∗
MD. Thus, (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) is Pareto-
optimal if it is achievable and if for every other achievable pair (p′

(30.7)
The radar problem is to identify the Pareto-optimal pairs and the guessing rules
that achieve them.
Examples of various achievable regions (shadowed) and their corresponding Pareto-
optimal pairs (solid lines) can be found in Figure 30.1. In (b) the support of f0 is
strictly contained in that of f1, so—by guessing “H = 0” whenever the observation
falls in the support set of f0— we can achieve zero pFA with pMD strictly smaller
than 1. In (c) the support of f1 is strictly contained in that of f0, so—by guessing
“H = 1” whenever the observation falls in the support set of f1— we can achieve
zero pMD with pFA strictly smaller than 1. In (d) the support sets are disjoint. In
this case all probability pairs (pFA, pMD) are achievable, and the sole Pareto-optimal
pair is (0, 0).
In the radar literature the problem is often formulated slightly diﬀerently. For a
given maximal tolerated false-alarm probability πFA, we seek the highest probabil-
ity of detection p∗
D(πFA). Thus,1
p∗
D(πFA) = max

Y
f1(y) I{y ∈Dc} dy,
(30.8a)
where the maximization is over all (Borel measurable) subsets D for which

Y
f0(y) I{y ∈Dc} dy ≤πFA.
(30.8b)
1Strictly speaking, it is prima facie not clear that the supremum is achieved, and it would
have been more appropriate to replace the maximum with a supremum. However, the maximum
is achieved: see Lemma 30.4.1 and Proposition 30.5.5 ahead.

other words, (πFA, p∗

able that the same missed-detection probability could be achievable with a smaller

In this case (p∗

is a fortiori achievable, and p∗
MD(p∗
FA) cannot be larger than p∗
MD because the
rule that achieves (p∗

MD) is in the feasible set of the minimization (30.9) that
deﬁnes p∗
MD(p∗

MD because if it were, then the rule
that achieves p∗
MD(p∗
FA) would have false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities
that are “better” than (p∗

(p∗

The relationship between Pareto-optimality and the function pFA 	→p∗

illustrated in Figure 30.2. The shaded region corresponds to pairs (pFA, pMD) that

30.1 The Setup
745
As in Section 20.6, we can extend the class of decision rules to allow randomization.
A randomized decision rule is speciﬁed by a mapping b: Y →[0, 1] with the
understanding that if we observe yobs then we guess “H = 0” with probability
b(yobs) and we guess “H = 1” with probability 1 −b(yobs); cf. Figure 20.1 on
Page 404. For such a rule the probability of false alarm pFA(b) is
pFA(b) =

Y

1 −b(y)

f0(y) dy;
(30.12)
the probability of missed-detection pMD(b) is
pMD(b) =

Y
b(y) f1(y) dy,
(30.13)
and the probability of detection is
pD(b) = 1 −pMD(b) =

Y

1 −b(y)

f1(y) dy.
(30.14)
The set of all pairs that are achievable by some randomized guessing rule is de-
noted Rrnd. Since every deterministic rule that guesses “H = 0” when y ∈D can
be viewed as a randomized rule with b(y) = I{y ∈D},
R ⊆Rrnd.
(30.15)
A pair (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) is said to be Pareto-optimal with respect to the class
of randomized guessing rules if it is achievable by some randomized guessing
rule and if (30.7) holds for all pairs (p′
FA, p′
MD) that are achievable with a possibly-
randomized guessing rule. A guessing rule is said to be Pareto-optimal with respect
to the class of randomized guessing rules if the error probabilities (pFA, pMD) asso-
ciated with it are Pareto-optimal with respect to the class of randomized guessing
rules.
In analogy to p∗
MD(πFA), we deﬁne p∗
MD,rnd(πFA) as the minimal2 probability of
missed-detection that can be achieved by a randomized rule whose probability of
false alarm does not exceed πFA:
p∗
MD,rnd(πFA) =
min
b: pFA(b)≤πFA pMD(b).
(30.16)
Using arguments similar to those justifying (30.10) we conclude:
Proposition 30.1.1. If (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) is Pareto-optimal with respect to the class of
randomized guessing rules, then p∗
MD,rnd(p∗
FA) = p∗
MD.
Since every pair (pFA, pMD) that is achievable with a deterministic guessing rule is
also achievable with a randomized decision rule (30.15),
p∗
MD,rnd(πFA) ≤p∗
MD(πFA).
(30.17)
Later we shall see (Corollary 30.5.6) that, because the observation has a density
under both hypotheses, this inequality is in fact an equality.
2Again, prima facie the minimum need not exist, and we should replace the minimum
in (30.16) with an inﬁmum.
However, it turns out that the inﬁmum can be achieved:

Lemma 30.4.1 and Lemma 30.5.4.

The Radar Problem
30.2
The Radar and the Knapsack Problems
Among all guessing rules whose false-alarm probability does not exceed πFA, which
one has the highest probability of detection? For some intuition, let us think about
each y in Y as an object of weight f0(y) and of monetary value f1(y). (The set of
objects is uncountable, but let us ignore this.) Rather than focusing on the set D,
which deﬁnes the guessing rule via (30.2), let us focus on its complement Dc, which
also deﬁnes the guessing rule. And let us think of Dc as a bag of objects. The
problem of choosing Dc—and hence a guessing rule—is then the problem of picking
which objects to place in the bag. The total weight of the bag is the sum of the
weights of the objects in the bag and, as such, corresponds to the RHS of (30.3c).
The weight of the bag is thus the probability of false alarm of the rule it deﬁnes.
Similarly, the total monetary value of the bag corresponds to the RHS of (30.6)
and is thus the probability of detection of the rule it deﬁnes. Viewed this way,
our problem is similar to the one encountered by a robber who breaks into a home
containing many objects of various weights and values. The robber must decide
which objects to put in the bag with the goal of maximizing the bag’s value subject
to the maximal weight the robber can carry.
A natural approach is the greedy one, according to which the robber ﬁrst places
in the bag the object whose value-to-weight ratio is highest (diamond?), followed
by the one whose value-to-weight ratio is the second highest, etc. The robber thus
continues to place objects in the bag in descending order of value-to-weight ratio
until the bag reaches the maximal weight the robber can carry. Stated diﬀerently,
in the greedy approach the robber judiciously chooses a threshold to which the
robber compares the value-to-weight ratios of the diﬀerent objects: any object
having a higher ratio is placed in the bag, and any object of a lower ratio is not.
While perfectly reasonable, in some scenarios this approach is suboptimal. For
example, suppose there are three objects in the home, the ﬁrst of which weighs 6
kilograms and is worth $1, 200, whereas each of the other two weighs 5 kilograms
and is worth $900. If the maximal weight the robber can carry is 10 kilograms, then
the greedy approach is suboptimal: after placing in the bag the object of highest
value-to-weight ratio (the ﬁrst) the bag is worth $1, 200 and weighs 6 kilograms;
nothing more will ﬁt in the bag, and the robber’s loot is $1, 200. The robber could
do better by forgoing the ﬁrst object and placing the other two objects in the bag
with a combined value of $1, 800.
Of course, an even better approach is to place the ﬁrst object in the bag and to
then place 80% of the second (whatever this may mean). This would result in a bag
of weight 6+0.8×5 (= 10) kilograms and of value $1, 200+0.8×$900 (= $1, 920).
In the Computer Science literature the robber’s problem is called the Knapsack
Problem. If the robber can take a fraction of each object, the problem is called
the Fractional Knapsack Problem; otherwise it is called the 0-1 Knapsack
Problem.3
The Fractional Knapsack Problem can indeed be solved using the
greedy approach; the 0-1 Knapsack Problem is harder and is often solved using
Dynamic Programming techniques.
3Computer scientists also assume that the number of objects is ﬁnite and that the weights
and values are positive integers.

30.3 Pareto-Optimality and Linear Functionals
747
The radar problem with deterministic decision rules is reminiscent of the 0-1 Knap-
sack Problem, because for each “object” (y) we must decide whether to place it
in the bag (Dc) or not (i.e., place it in D). When randomized rules are allowed
the problem is reminiscent of the Fractional Knapsack Problem, because specifying
some b(y) is tantamount to contributing

1 −b(y)

f0(y) to the weight of the bag
(cf. (30.12)) and (1 −b(y)) f1(y) to its value (cf. (30.14)).
Nevertheless, as we shall see, in the radar problem the greedy approach is optimal
even when we do not allow randomization. This is because we have assumed a
continuum of objects and densities for the observation (under both hypotheses).
The greedy approach is optimal even if we do not assume densities, provided we
allow for randomization. Either way, randomization makes the solution a bit more
elegant in allowing us to describe the guessing rule in terms of the likelihood-ratio
function, LR: Y →[0, ∞], which we encountered in (20.38)–(20.39):
LR(y) = f0(y)
f1(y),

30.3
Pareto-Optimality and Linear Functionals
Some of the properties of Pareto-optimal pairs have less to do with the radar prob-
lem and more with the fact that if (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) is Pareto-optimal then it is achievable
and no other achievable pair can be “better” than it. For example, there cannot
be two diﬀerent Pareto-optimal pairs of equal false-alarm probabilities, because
otherwise the pair of smaller missed-detection probability would be “better” than
the other and thus contradict the latter’s Pareto-optimality. Hence:
Note 30.3.1. Two Pareto-optimal pairs of equal false-alarm probabilities must also
have equal missed-detection probabilities.
Another such property is related to the minimization of linear functionals with
positive coeﬃcients. If (p′
FA, p′
MD) is “better” than (pFA, pMD), and if α and β are
both positive, then α p′
FA + β p′
MD must be smaller than α pFA + β pMD. Turn-
ing this around, if α and β are positive and for no achievable pair (p′
FA, p′
MD) is
α p′
FA +β p′
MD smaller than α pFA +β pMD, then no achievable pair is “better” than
(pFA, pMD). Thus, if (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) minimizes α pFA + β pMD among all achievable
pairs (pFA, pMD), then (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) must be Pareto-optimal. We have thus proved:
Proposition 30.3.2 (Minimizers of Positive Functionals Are Pareto-Optimal).
(i) If, among all guessing rules, a given guessing rule minimizes α pFA + β pMD
for some positive α and β, then this rule’s probabilities of false alarm and
missed-detection are Pareto-optimal.
(ii) If, among all randomized guessing rules, a given guessing rule minimizes
α pFA +β pMD for some positive α and β, then this rule’s probabilities of false

The Radar Problem
alarm and missed-detection are Pareto-optimal with respect to the class of
randomized guessing rules.
Proof. It is probably easier to prove this on one’s own than to follow someone
else’s proof. But we provide a proof nonetheless. We begin with the deterministic
case, i.e., with Part (i). Let (pFA, pMD) be the probabilities of error associated with
the given guessing rule. This part’s hypothesis guarantees that if (p′
FA, p′
MD) are
the probabilities of error associated with any other guessing rule, then
α pFA + β pMD ≤α p′
FA + β p′
MD.
(30.19)
Equivalently,
α(p′
FA −pFA) + β(p′
MD −pMD) ≥0.
(30.20)
Consequently, if p′
FA ≤pFA then p′
MD cannot be smaller than pMD because in
this case the ﬁrst term on the LHS of (30.20) is nonpositive, so for (30.20) to
hold β(p′
MD −pMD) cannot be negative and hence, since β is strictly positive,
(p′
MD −pMD) cannot be negative. Similarly, if p′
MD ≤pMD then p′
FA cannot be
smaller than pFA because in this case the second term on the LHS of (30.20) is
nonpositive, so for (30.20) to hold α(p′
FA −pFA) cannot be negative and hence,
since α is strictly positive, (p′
FA −pFA) cannot be negative. This concludes the
proof of Part (i).
The proof of Part (ii) is nearly identical.
Simply replace “guessing rule” with
“possibly-randomized guessing rule.”
30.4
One Type of Error Is Not Allowed
Suppose no false alarms are allowed. What is then the least probability of missed-
detection p∗
MD(0) we can achieve? In this section we compute this probability and
provide a guessing rule that achieves it. The analogous problem when no missed-
detections are allowed and we seek the least probability of false alarm p∗
FA(0) has
a similar solution.
At ﬁrst sight one might erroneously think that to preclude false alarms we must
never guess “H = 1,” i.e., that we must choose Dc to be the empty set. But this is
not always the case: it suﬃces that we only guess “H = 1” when f0(yobs) is zero,
i.e., that Dc only contain observations yobs for which f0(yobs) is zero. Indeed,

Dc ⊆

y ∈Y : f0(y) = 0

=⇒

pFA = 0

,
(30.21)
because if the LHS of (30.21) holds, then the integrand in (30.3b) is zero over
the range of integration, and pFA is zero. To minimize the probability of missed-
detection, we choose Dc to be the largest we can while satisfying the condition on
the LHS of (30.21). Thus, we choose
Dc =

y ∈Y : f0(y) = 0

(30.22)
with the result that
p∗
MD(0) =

30.4 One Type of Error Is Not Allowed
749
For example, in the one-dimensional case with the densities f0(y) = I{0 ≤y ≤1}
and f1(y) = I{0.25 ≤y ≤1.25} a rule that achieves p∗
MD(0) is to guess “H = 0”
whenever yobs is in the interval [0, 1], i.e., to choose D to be the interval [0, 1] with
the result that p∗
MD(0) = 0.75.
The optimality of (30.22) is almost self-evident, but not quite. The slight technical
diﬃculty is that the LHS of (30.21) is suﬃcient to guarantee no false alarms, but
it is not necessary. Are there other decision rules that also guarantee zero false
alarms? As we shall see in the next lemma, there are, but they diﬀer from (30.22)
only on sets of Lebesgue measure zero, which do not inﬂuence the probability of
missed-detection. The lemma also shows that randomized guessing rules are no
better for this problem than the best deterministic ones.
Lemma 30.4.1 (Optimal Rule with No False Alarms). Among all randomized
guessing rules whose probability of false alarm is zero, the deterministic guessing
rule (30.22) minimizes the probability of missed-detection and yields the missed-
detection probability in (30.23). Thus,
p∗
MD(0) = p∗
MD,rnd(0) =

{y∈Y : f0(y)>0}
f1(y) dy.
(30.24)
Moreover,

0, p∗
MD(0)

is Pareto-optimal
(30.25)
both with respect to the class of deterministic rules and of randomized rules.
Proof. Consider any randomized decision rule that is determined by a function
b: Y →[0, 1] and whose false-alarm probability is zero, i.e., (see (30.12))

Y

1 −b(y)

f0(y) dy = 0.
(30.26)
The integral of a nonnegative function can be zero only if the set over which the
function is positive is of Lebesgue measure zero (Proposition 2.5.3 (i)).
Thus,
(30.26) implies that the set

y ∈Y : 1 −b(y) > 0 and f0(y) > 0

(30.27)
must be of Lebesgue measure zero. Consequently, the integral of any function—
and in particular the function y 	→

f1(y)—over this set’s complement is
identical to the integral over all Y, and

The Radar Problem
where the second line holds because when 1 −b(y) is zero so is the integrand;
the third line holds because the integrand is nonnegative, so inﬂating the set over
which we integrate cannot decrease the integral; and the fourth line follows by
upper-bounding 1 −b(y) by 1.
Since the LHS of (30.28) is the probability of
detection of the rule deﬁned by b(·), if we subtract both sides of (30.28) from 1 we
obtain
pMD(b) ≥1 −

{y∈Y : f0(y)=0}
f1(y) dy
=

{y∈Y : f0(y)>0}
f1(y) dy.
(30.29)
Since this inequality holds for every randomized rule b(·) whose false-alarm prob-
ability is zero, it establishes the optimality of the guessing rule (30.22) whose
false-alarm probability is zero and whose missed-detection probability is the RHS
of (30.29).
The Pareto-optimality of

0, p∗
MD(0)

is almost self-evident. To prove it for deter-
ministic rules using (30.7), we consider any achievable pair (p′
FA, p′
MD) satisfying
p′
FA ≤0 and p′
MD ≤p∗
MD(0) and prove that both inequalities must hold with equal-
ity. Clearly p′
FA ≤0 implies equality, i.e., p′
FA = 0, because probabilities are non-
negative. And the achievability of (p′
FA, p′
MD)—which by the above is (0, p′
MD)—
implies (by the deﬁnition of p∗
MD(0) as the lowest missed-detection probability that
can be achieved by a deterministic guessing rule of zero false-alarm probability)
that p′
MD ≥p∗
MD(0), which, in combination with the assumption p′
MD ≤p∗
MD(0),
implies equality.
The proof for randomized rules is almost identical: simply replace “deterministic”
with “randomized” and p∗
MD(0) with p∗
MD,rnd(0) (which, by (30.24), is identical to
it).
We can analyze the case where no missed-detections are allowed in a similar way.
In this case it is optimal to guess “H = 0” whenever f1(yobs) is zero. This leads to
D =

y ∈Y : f1(y) = 0

(30.30)
with the result that
p∗
FA(0) =

{y∈Y : f1(y)>0}
f0(y) dy.
(30.31)
And like Lemma 30.4.1 we have:
Lemma 30.4.2 (Optimal Rule with No Missed-Detections). Among all random-
ized guessing rules whose probability of missed-detection is zero, the deterministic
guessing rule (30.30) minimizes the probability of false alarm and yields the false-
alarm probability in (30.31). Thus,

both with respect to the class of deterministic rules and of randomized rules.
Note 30.4.3. In view of Lemma 30.4.1, we shall no longer distinguish between
p∗
MD(0) and p∗
MD,rnd(0). Likewise, in view of Lemma 30.4.2, we shall no longer
distinguish between p∗
FA(0) and p∗
FA,rnd(0).
The achievability of the pair (p∗
FA(0), 0) using a deterministic guessing rule shows
that p∗
MD(πFA) is zero whenever πFA ≥p∗
FA(0).
And since p∗
MD,rnd(πFA) never
exceeds p∗
MD(πFA), we conclude:
Corollary 30.4.4. If πFA is larger than p∗
FA(0), then both p∗
MD(πFA) and p∗

are zero:
p∗
MD(πFA) = p∗
MD,rnd(πFA) = 0,
πFA ≥p∗
FA(0).

Corollary 30.4.5. There are no Pareto-optimal pairs (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) (be it with respect
to deterministic or randomized rules) with p∗
FA larger than p∗
FA(0).
Proof. Let (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) be Pareto-optimal.
Then the achievability of (p∗
FA(0), 0)
using a deterministic guessing rule implies that if both p∗
FA(0) ≤p∗
FA and 0 ≤p∗
MD
then both must hold with equality (cf. (30.7)). But the inequality 0 ≤p∗
MD always
holds. We thus conclude that if the inequality p∗
FA(0) ≤p∗
FA holds, then it must
hold with equality. Thus p∗
FA cannot exceed p∗
FA(0).

Likelihood-Ratio Tests
A key role in the radar problem is played by likelihood-ratio tests, which we deﬁne
next.
Deﬁnition 30.5.1 (Likelihood-Ratio Test). We say that a deterministic guessing
rule φGuess(·) speciﬁed by the set D is a likelihood-ratio test with the threshold
0 ≤Υ ≤∞if it guesses “H = 0” whenever LR(yobs) is strictly larger than Υ, and
it guesses “H = 1” whenever LR(yobs) is strictly smaller than Υ, i.e, if

LR(y) > Υ

=⇒

y ∈D

(30.35a)

LR(y) < Υ

=⇒

y /∈D

.
(30.35b)
(There are no restrictions on φGuess(yobs) when LR(yobs) is equal to Υ.)
A similar deﬁnition holds for randomized guessing rules with (30.35) replaced by

LR(y) > Υ

=⇒

b(y) = 1

(30.36a)

LR(y) < Υ

=⇒

b(y) = 0

.
(30.36b)
Although there is no prior in the radar problem, from every radar problem and
every α ∈(0, 1) we can construct a binary hypothesis-testing problem with a
nondegenerate prior (of the kind we encountered in Chapter 20) by setting
Pr[H = 0] = α,
Pr[H = 1] = 1 −α,

The Radar Problem
and by setting for every y ∈Y
fY|H=0(y) = f0(y),
fY|H=1(y) = f1(y).
(30.37b)
Any guessing rule for the radar problem can also be used for the hypothesis-
testing problem (30.37) and vice versa.
If φGuess(·) is a guessing rule that on
the hypothesis-testing problem yields the error probabilities p(error|H = 0) and
p(error|H = 1), then on the radar problem it will yield
pMD = p(error|H = 1),
pFA = p(error|H = 0).
(30.37c)
As we saw in Chapter 20 (see Theorem 20.5.2 and the discussion of randomized
decision rules in Section 20.6), if the prior is nondegenerate, then
Pr[H = 0] p(error|H = 0) + Pr[H = 1] p(error|H = 1)
is minimized by a guessing rule that compares the likelihood-ratio function LR(yobs)
to the ratio Pr[H = 1]/ Pr[H = 0] and guesses H accordingly. This rule minimizes
the probability of error irrespective of how it resolves ties. In view of (30.37a), the
ratio Pr[H = 1]/ Pr[H = 0] can be expressed as (1 −α)/α. We can also turn this
around: a likelihood-ratio test of threshold Υ ∈(0, ∞) minimizes
α p(error|H = 0) + (1 −α) p(error|H = 1)
whenever α is such that
1 −α
α
= Υ.
(30.38)
Solving (30.38) for α in terms of Υ, we conclude that among all guessing rules
(deterministic or randomized) any likelihood-ratio test of threshold Υ ∈(0, ∞)
minimizes
1
Υ + 1 p(error|H = 0) +
Υ
Υ + 1 p(error|H = 1).
Stated in terms of the radar problem using (30.37c): irrespective of how it resolves
ties, a likelihood-ratio test of threshold 0 < Υ < ∞minimizes
1
Υ + 1 pFA +
Υ
Υ + 1 pMD
(30.39)
among all randomized guessing rules. It thus follows from Proposition 30.3.2 (ii)
that likelihood-ratio tests are Pareto-optimal. This result, which we state next,
is sometimes called the Neyman-Pearson Lemma after the statisticians Jerzy
Neyman (1894–1981) and Egon Pearson (1895–1980).
Proposition 30.5.2 (Likelihood-Ratio Tests Are Pareto-Optimal). Irrespective of
how it resolves ties, any likelihood-ratio test of ﬁnite positive threshold Υ minimizes
1
Υ + 1 pFA +
Υ
Υ + 1 pMD
(30.40)
among all randomized guessing rules and is thus Pareto-optimal with respect to the
class of randomized guessing rules.

Υ+1 pMD among all achievable pairs. It is Pareto-optimal and marked

it minimizes
1
Υ+1 pFA +
Υ
Υ+1 pMD among all achievable pairs. But for this value of
Υ it is not the unique minimizer: all the (Pareto-optimal) points that lie on the
solid line segment going through it are also minimizers. For no value of Υ is the
point marked by a bullet the unique minimizer. Incidentally, the point marked by
a square is Pareto-optimal, and it is the unique minimizer of
1
Υ+1 pFA +
Υ
Υ+1 pMD
for a whole range of values of Υ.
To gain some geometric insight into the minimization of (30.40), recall that given
any number c, the loci of pairs (pFA, pMD) satisfying
1
Υ + 1 pFA +
Υ
Υ + 1 pMD = c
is a straight line of slope −1/Υ. Depending on the value of c, the line may or
may not contain pairs (pFA, pMD) that are achievable. For example, if c is zero,
then the line contains an achievable pair only if we can simultaneously achieve
zero false alarms and zero missed-detections. For larger values of c, the line may
contain achievable pairs even if (0, 0) is not achievable. Figure 30.3 (a) depicts an
achievable region and some such lines. The lines that do not contain achievable
pairs are dashed, and those that do are solid. Of all the lines that contain achievable
pairs, the one whose value of c is smallest is drawn thick. This line intersects (in
this example) the achievable region at a single point, which is marked by a bullet
and at which the line is tangent to the curve of Pareto-optimal pairs. But, as
Figure 30.3 (b) shows, the minimizing line may intersect the achievable region at
more than one point. Moreover, the curve of Pareto-optimal pairs may contain
“corners” at which the tangent is undeﬁned.

The Radar Problem
Having shown that every likelihood-ratio test of ﬁnite positive threshold yields a
Pareto-optimal pair, we now ask the reverse question: is every Pareto-optimal pair
(p∗
FA, p∗
MD) achievable by some likelihood-ratio test of some ﬁnite threshold? As
we shall see—in the range 0 < p∗
FA < p∗
FA(0)—the answer is “yes.” To prove this
requires a bit more than just showing that every Pareto-optimal pair minimizes
some functional of the form α pFA + β pMD with α, β > 0: it is possible that a pair
that we wish to achieve minimizes α pFA + β pMD but that another undesired pair
also minimizes it. In this case we need to show that a likelihood-ratio test exists
that achieves the desired and not the undesired pair. This will require a judicious
choice of the mechanism for resolving ties.
Figure 30.3 (b) depicts a situation
where there is a unique value of Υ for which
1
Υ+1 pFA +
Υ
Υ+1 pMD is minimized at
the (desired) point marked by a bullet, but for this value of Υ all the points on
the thick line segment containing the bullet are also minimizers. Incidentally, this
ﬁgure also shows that a given point (in this example the one marked by a square)
may be the minimizer of (30.40) for a whole range of values of Υ.
To overcome these diﬃculties, we shall adopt a somewhat less geometric and more
algebraic approach.
To this end we ﬁrst introduce the cumulative distribution
function of LR(Y) under the null hypothesis and study some of its properties. This
function is key to the study of the performance of likelihood-ratio tests. Deﬁne

(30.43)
Proof. Being the distribution function of the random variable LR(Y) (when Y
is drawn according to f0(·)), the function ξ 	→P0[LR(Y) ≤ξ] is monotonically
nondecreasing and continuous from the right (Billingsley, 1995, Chapter 2, Sec-
tion 14).4
4Strictly speaking, LR(Y) is not a random variable, because it can take on the value +∞. As
such, it is a “generalized random variable,” but the distribution function of a generalized random
variable is also nondecreasing and continuous from the right.

To establish (30.42) we note that the convention 0/0 = 1—which we adopted when
we deﬁned the likelihood-ratio function in (20.39) and (30.18)—implies that

y : LR(y) = 0} =

y : f0(y) = 0

\

y : f0(y) = f1(y) = 0

(30.44)
Consequently,
P0

LR(Y) = 0

Y ∈{y : LR(y) = 0}

Y ∈{y : f0(y) = 0} \ {y : f0(y) = f1(y) = 0}

≤P0

Y ∈{y : f0(y) = 0}

= 0.
We next turn to proving (30.43). Our convention (30.18b) implies that

y : LR(y) < ∞} =

y : f1(y) > 0

∪

y : f0(y) = f1(y) = 0

Since
P0

Y ∈{y : f0(y) = f1(y) = 0}

≤P0

Y ∈{y : f0(y) = 0}

= 0,
(30.46)
it follows from (30.45) and (30.46) that
P0

LR(Y) < ∞

= P0

Y ∈{y : LR(y) < ∞}

= P0

Y ∈{y : f1(y) > 0}

= p∗
FA(0),
where the last equality follows from (30.32).
With the aid of Lemma 30.5.3 we can now analyze likelihood-ratio tests and prove
that any Pareto-optimal pair whose false-alarm probability is (strictly) between 0
and p∗
FA(0) can be achieved by such a test.
Lemma 30.5.4. For every 0 < πFA < p∗

The Radar Problem
there is a choice of the threshold Υ ∈(0, ∞) and of γ ∈[0, 1] that results in
the test (30.47) having false-alarm probability πFA. Denoting this test’s missed-
detection probability by p∗
MD, it will then follow from the Pareto-optimality of
all likelihood-ratio tests (Proposition 30.5.2) that the pair (πFA, p∗
MD) is Pareto-
optimal with respect to the class of randomized guessing rules and hence that p∗
MD
equals p∗
MD,rnd(πFA) (Proposition 30.1.1).
Using the notation we introduced in (30.41), the probability of false alarm of the
likelihood-ratio test (30.47) can be expressed as
P0

LR(Y) < Υ

+ (1 −γ) P0

LR(Y) = Υ

.
(30.49)
We shall conclude the proof by showing that for every πFA in the range (30.48)
there exist Υ > 0 and γ ∈[0, 1] for which this expression equals πFA.
We begin with Υ, which we would like to choose so that (30.52) and (30.54) ahead
will hold. To this end, we deﬁne Υ as
Υ = min
'
ξ ∈R : P0

LR(Y) ≤ξ

≥πFA
(
.
(30.50)
Here the set whose smallest element we seek is not empty because, by (30.43),
lim
ξ→∞P0

LR(Y) ≤ξ

= P0

LR(Y) < ∞

= p∗
FA(0),
(30.51)
and we are only considering the case (30.48) where πFA is smaller than p∗
FA(0). This
set has a smallest element because ξ 	→P0[LR(Y) ≤ξ] is continuous from the right
(Lemma 30.5.3). The minimum is thus deﬁned and ﬁnite. Also, since the smallest
element is in the set, it cannot be zero, because—by (30.42) and (30.48)—zero is
not in the set. Thus, indeed, 0 < Υ < ∞.
With this deﬁnition, Υ has the following properties: Since Υ is in the set,
P0

LR(Y) ≤Υ

≥πFA.
(30.52)
And since it is the smallest element in the set, no number smaller than Υ is in the
set, so
P0

LR(Y) ≤Υ −ϵ

< πFA,
ϵ > 0.
(30.53)
From (30.53) we obtain upon letting ϵ tend to zero from above that
P0

LR(Y) < Υ

≤πFA.
(30.54)
Having deﬁned Υ and derived its salient properties, we next describe our choice of γ.
It depends on whether or not P0[LR(Y) = Υ] is zero. If P0[LR(Y) = Υ] is zero,
then the left-hand sides of (30.52) and (30.54) are equal, so one can be smaller-or-
equal πFA and the other greater-or-equal πFA only if they are both equal to πFA. In
this case, the likelihood-ratio test with threshold Υ has false-alarm probability πFA
irrespective of how we resolve ties (see (30.49)).
We can choose γ as zero for
concreteness.
Suppose now that P0[LR(Y) = Υ] is not zero. In this case we choose 1 −γ as
1 −γ = πFA −P0

LR(Y) < Υ

LR(Y) = Υ

30.5 Likelihood-Ratio Tests

The number on the RHS is nonnegative by (30.54), and it does not exceed one
because
πFA −P0

LR(Y) < Υ

= πFA −P0

LR(Y) ≤Υ

+ P0

LR(Y) = Υ

≤P0

LR(Y) = Υ

,
(30.56)
where the inequality follows from (30.52). Substituting this choice of γ in (30.49)
shows that the false-alarm probability of the likelihood-ratio test deﬁned by Υ and
by γ is πFA.
We next show that randomization is not essential for obtaining the Pareto-optimal
pairs: if we do not insist that the likelihood-ratio test depend on the observable yobs
only via LR(yobs), then randomization is not needed. This result relies heavily on
the assumption that under both hypotheses Y has a density. Had we allowed for
point masses, this result would not have held.
Proposition 30.5.5. For every 0 < πFA < p∗
FA(0), the pair

πFA, p∗
MD,rnd(πFA)

can be achieved using a deterministic likelihood-ratio test.
Proof. The randomized likelihood-ratio test in (30.47) is not deterministic when γ
is strictly between 0 and 1. Inspecting the proof of Lemma 30.5.4 we see that this
is the case whenever P0

LR(Y) = Υ

is nonzero and the RHS of (30.55) is strictly
between 0 and 1, i.e., whenever
0 < πFA −P0

LR(Y) < Υ

< P0

LR(Y) = Υ

,
(30.57)
where the threshold Υ is deﬁned in (30.50).
We shall thus conclude the proof
by showing that when (30.57) holds, we can ﬁnd an alternative deterministic
likelihood-ratio test of false-alarm probability πFA.
Our proposed deterministic likelihood-ratio test will also be of threshold Υ. But it
will not treat all the observations yobs for which LR(yobs) equals Υ in the same way:
some such observations will result in the guess “H = 0,” and others in “H = 1.”
To be more speciﬁc, denote the ﬁrst component of the observed vector Y by Y (1)
and the ﬁrst component of its realization yobs by y(1)
obs. The deterministic rule we
propose guesses “H = 0” whenever yobs is in the set
D =
'
yobs : LR(yobs) > Υ
(
∪
'
yobs : LR(yobs) = Υ and y(1)
obs ≥ξ
(
(30.58)
for some judicious choice of ξ that will guarantee a false-alarm probability πFA.
The false-alarm probability of this rule is
P0

LR(Y) < Υ

+ P0

LR(Y) = Υ and Y (1) < ξ

(30.59)
For this to equal πFA, we need to choose ξ so that
P0

LR(Y) = Υ and Y (1) < ξ

LR(Y) < Υ

The Radar Problem
This function is monotonically nondecreasing;
lim
α→∞g(α) = P0

LR(Y) = Υ

(30.62a)
(as can be proved using the Monotone Convergence Theorem); and
lim
α→−∞g(α) = 0
(30.62b)
(as can be proved by noting that g(·) is bounded from above by the cumulative
distribution function of Y (1), which tends to zero as its argument tends to −∞).
Once we show that g is continuous, the existence of a ξ satisfying (30.60) will
follow from (30.62) and (30.57) using the Intermediate Value Theorem (Rudin,
1976, Theorem 4.23, p. 93), (Royden and Fitzpatrick, 2010, Section 1.6).
It thus only remains to prove that g is continuous.
Since g is monotonically
nondecreasing, |g(α + h) −g(α)| is upper-bounded by g(α + |h|) −g(α −|h|),
and to prove continuity at α it suﬃces to prove that g(α + h) −g(α −h) tends
to zero when h tends to zero from above. To establish this, we note that for any
positive h,
0 ≤g(α + h) −g(α −h)
= P0

LR(Y) = Υ and Y (1) < α + h

LR(Y) = Υ and Y (1) < α −h

LR(Y) = Υ and α −h ≤Y (1) < α + h

≤P0

α −h ≤Y (1) < α + h

,
and the RHS tends to zero as h ↓0 because the hypothesis that Y has a density
implies that so does its ﬁrst component Y (1), and consequently the cumulative
distribution function of Y (1) is continuous.
Combining this result with (30.24) and (30.34) we obtain:
Corollary 30.5.6. The functions p∗

30.6 A Gaussian Example

30.6
A Gaussian Example
How do we guess whether an observed random variable Y was generated from a
centered or from a mean-A Gaussian distribution? Here we answer this question
for the case where the observed random variable has the same variance under the
two hypotheses. We denote this variance by σ2, and we assume that σ > 0 so
f0(y) =
1
√
2πσ2 e−y2
2σ2 ,
y ∈R,
(30.64a)
f1(y) =
1
√
2πσ2 e−(y−A)2
2σ2
,
y ∈R.
(30.64b)
We further assume that A is positive. (If it is zero, then f0(·) and f1(·) are identical
and the observation is of no use. And if it is negative, we can consider −Y as our
observation.)
Since f0(·) is positive, it follows from Lemma 30.4.1 that p∗
MD(0) = 1. Likewise,
since f1(·) is positive, it follows from Lemma 30.4.2 that p∗
FA(0) = 1. The pairs
(0, 1) and (1, 0) are thus Pareto-optimal. We next ﬁnd the more interesting pairs.
Any guessing rule that guesses “H = 0” whenever LR(yobs) ≥Υ is Pareto-optimal
for every value of Υ ∈(0, ∞) (Proposition 30.5.2). Consequently, so is the rule
that guesses “H = 0” whenever LLR(yobs) ≥log Υ (because the logarithm is a
monotonic function, so the two rules are, in fact, identical). As Υ varies over the
positive reals, its logarithm varies over all the reals. In other words, every υ in R is
the logarithm of some positive Υ. Hence, the rule that guesses “H = 0” whenever
LLR(yobs) ≥υ is Pareto-optimal for every υ ∈R (because, it is identical to the rule
that guesses “H = 0” whenever LR(yobs) ≥eυ, and the latter is Pareto-optimal
because it is a likelihood-ratio test with positive ﬁnite threshold). We next explore
such rules and show that with a judicious choice of υ ∈R they can achieve any
prespeciﬁed false-alarm probability that is strictly between zero and one. There is
no need to randomize or scrutinize ties.
For the densities in (30.64) the log likelihood-ratio function is
LLR(y) = −Ay

y ∈R,

The Radar Problem
We thus see that to every υ ∈R there corresponds some ˜υ (which is given in (30.67))
such that the rule of guessing “H = 0” whenever yobs ≤˜υ is Pareto-optimal. But
we can strengthen the statement and claim that this rule is Pareto-optimal for every
˜υ ∈R, because to every ˜υ ∈R there corresponds some υ ∈R for which (30.67)
holds.
The probability of false alarm of the rule (30.66) is

(30.68)
where in the second line we have noted that under the null hypothesis Y has a
N(0, σ) distribution and hence exceeds ˜υ with the probability speciﬁed in (19.12a).
Since the Q-function maps R onto (0, 1), for each prespeciﬁed false-alarm probabil-
ity pFA (strictly) between 0 and 1 we can ﬁnd some ˜υ ∈R for which (30.68) holds.
For this choice of ˜υ ∈R the decision rule (30.66) is not only Pareto-optimal, but
also of the desired false-alarm probability. Its missed-detection probability is

(30.69)
because, under the alternative hypothesis the observation Y has a N(A, σ) distribu-

We can now characterize the Pareto-optimal pairs of error probabilities. Those
comprise the pair (0, 1), the pair (1, 0), and all the pairs that have the form

Detecting a Signal in White Gaussian Noise
In our next example the observation consists of a stochastic process

Y (t), t ∈R

.
Under the null hypothesis, it is the realization of white Gaussian noise N of double-
sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the bandwidth W, whereas under the alternative
hypothesis it is the sum of such noise N and some integrable signal s that is
bandlimited to W Hz. Given the signal s and the PSD SNN of the noise, our task
is to design a guessing rule that bases its decision on the observed SP.5
We ﬁrst argue that there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on ⟨Y, φ⟩,
where
φ =
s
∥s∥2
(30.71)
is a unit-vector collinear with s. We do so by showing that, given any guessing
rule that bases its guess on Y, we can construct a randomized rule of identical
performance that bases its decision on ⟨Y, φ⟩. The argument is very similar to the

erated by the cylindrical sets of Y (Deﬁnition 25.2.2).

one we employed in proving Theorem 26.3.1 and which was illustrated in Figure 26.1
on Page 623.
The rule we construct uses ⟨Y, φ⟩and local randomness to generate a SP Y′, which
is then fed to the given guessing rule. Since Y′ will be generated in a way that will
guarantee that its FDDs equal those of Y under both hypotheses, the constructed
rule and the given rule will have identical performance.
To generate Y′, the rule we construct ﬁrst uses the local randomness to generate
a SP N′ of the same law as N but independent of it. In terms of ⟨Y, φ⟩and N′,
we can express Y′ as
Y′ = ⟨Y, φ⟩φ + N′ −⟨N′, φ⟩φ
(30.72)
=

⟨N, φ⟩φ + N′ −⟨N′, φ⟩φ
if Y = N,
⟨N, φ⟩φ + N′ −⟨N′, φ⟩φ + s
if Y = s + N,
(30.73)
where in the last line we have used the fact that ⟨s + N, φ⟩= ⟨s, φ⟩+ ⟨N, φ⟩
and ⟨s, φ⟩φ = s. We see from (30.73) that, under both hypotheses, Y′ and Y
have identical laws, because N and ⟨N, φ⟩φ + N′ −⟨N′, φ⟩φ have identical laws
(Theorem 25.15.7).
Having established that there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on ⟨Y, φ⟩,
we next proceed to study the guessing problem when this is our observation. Us-
ing the properties of WGN (Proposition 25.15.2), we conclude that ⟨Y, φ⟩has a

Suﬃcient Statistics
We have seen that, when randomized guessing rules are allowed, any Pareto-
optimal pair (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) with 0 < p∗
FA < p∗
FA(0) can be achieved by a (random-
ized) likelihood-ratio test that bases its decision on the likelihood ratio LR(yobs)
(Lemma 30.5.4). It therefore stands to reason that if T(·) is a suﬃcient statistic for
f0(·) and f1(·) so LR(yobs) is computable from T(yobs) (Deﬁnition 20.12.2), then
basing our (randomized) guess on T(yobs) should incur no loss of optimality. This
is true, but before we can prove this we need to show that also the Pareto-optimal
pairs (0, p∗
MD(0)) and (p∗
FA(0), 0) can be achieved using guessing rules that depend
only on LR(yobs). (The rules in Lemma 30.4.1 and Lemma 30.4.2 are not quite of
this kind because of the convention we adopted to handle the case of 0/0 in the
deﬁnition of the likelihood-ratio function (30.18).)
Proposition 30.8.1 (Rules Based on LR(yobs) for pFA = 0 and for pMD = 0).
(i) Guessing “H = 0” whenever LR(yobs) > 0 achieves the pair (0, p∗
MD(0)).
(ii) Guessing “H = 0” whenever LR(yobs) = ∞achieves the pair (p∗
FA(0), 0).
Proof. We begin with Part (i). In view of our convention that 0/0 is 1,

y : f0(y) > 0

(30.76b)
we conclude that the events Y ∈{y : LR(y) > 0} and Y ∈{y : f0(y) > 0} have
identical probabilities under both hypotheses. Consequently, the rule of guessing
“H = 0” when yobs ∈{y : f0(y) > 0} and the rule of guessing “H = 0” when
yobs ∈{y : LR(y) > 0} have identical performance. And since the former achieves
(0, p∗
MD(0)) (Lemma 30.4.1), so does the latter.

30.9 A Noncoherent Detection Problem
763
We are now ready to state the main result on suﬃcient statistics.
Proposition 30.8.2 (Suﬃcient Statistics and the Radar Problem). If the mapping
T : Rd →Rd′ forms a suﬃcient statistic for the densities f0(·) and f1(·), then any
Pareto-optimal pair that can be achieved by a possibly-randomized guessing rule
that is based on Y can also be achieved by a randomized guessing rule that is based
on T(Y).
Proof. Let (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) be Pareto-optimal with respect to the class of randomized
guessing rules that are based on Y.
By Corollary 30.4.5, Lemma 30.5.4, and
Proposition 30.8.1 the pair (p∗
FA, p∗
MD) is achievable by a guessing rule that forms
its guess based on local randomness and the value of LR(yobs) that it is fed. Since
T : Rd →Rd′ is a suﬃcient statistic for the densities f0(·) and f1(·), there exists a
set Y0 ⊂Rd of Lebesgue measure zero and a Borel measurable function ζ : Rd′ →
[0, ∞] such that for all yobs ∈Rd satisfying
yobs /∈Y0
and
f0(yobs) + f1(yobs) > 0
(30.78)
we can express LR(yobs) in terms of T(yobs) as
LR(yobs) = ζ

T(yobs)

.
(30.79)
Suppose now that instead of LR(yobs) we feed ζ

T(yobs)

to the above rule. This
would result in a randomized rule that bases its decision on T(yobs). We claim
that this rule has the same performance as the one that is fed LR(yobs) and hence
also achieves (p∗
FA, p∗
MD). Indeed, under both hypotheses, the probability that the
observable yobs violates (30.78) is zero (cf. Note 20.12.1), so under both hypotheses
ζ

T(Y)

and LR(Y) are equal with probability one.

A Noncoherent Detection Problem

detection. The observation is a SP

(the “null hypothesis”) or the sum of noise and a passband signal of random phase
(the “alternative hypothesis”). We model the random passband signal S as

The Radar Problem
The noise is assumed to be WGN of double-sided PSD N0/2 with respect to the
bandwidth W around the carrier frequency fc (Deﬁnition 25.15.9). Notice that, by
Theorem 7.6.10,
⟨sc, ss⟩= 0.
(30.82)
Also, if we deﬁne Es as
Es = 2 ∥sBB∥2
2 ,
(30.83)
then, by Theorem 7.6.10 on the energy in baseband and passband,
Es = ∥S∥2
2 = ∥sc∥2
2 = ∥ss∥2
2
(30.84)
for every realization of Θ. The signals sc/√Es and ss/√Es are thus orthonormal.
The motivation for studying this problem is similar to the one in Section 27.1: We
envision a scenario where the distance to the target is known only approximately,
and we therefore only have an estimate of the arrival time of the reﬂected signal.
Our model is plausible when our estimation error is small compared to 1/W but
large compared to 1/fc.
As in Section 30.7, here too we can reduce the problem to a ﬁnite-dimensional one:
there is no loss of optimality in basing our guess on the tuple (Tc, Ts), where
Tc ≜
#
Y, sc
√Es
$
,
Ts ≜
#
Y, ss
√Es
$
.
(30.85)
Indeed, the performance of any given guessing rule that bases its decision on the
waveform Y can also be achieved by a randomized decision rule that bases its
decision on (Tc, Ts) in the following way.
It uses local randomness to generate
noise N′ of the same law as N; it uses (Tc, Ts) and N′ to synthesize Y′, where
Y′ = Tc

+ N′ −

$ sc

;
(30.86)
and it then feeds Y′ to the given rule. Using arguments very similar to those in
Section 30.7, it can be shown that the laws of Y′ and Y are identical both under
the null hypothesis and under the alternative hypothesis.
To derive Pareto-optimal rules based on the tuple (Tc, Ts), we next derive the
tuple’s densities under the two hypotheses.

(30.88)
(We deﬁne t not only to simplify the typesetting but also for ulterior motives that
have to do with the further reduction of the suﬃcient statistic from a random
vector of two components (Tc, Ts) to a scalar.)
Since the signals tuple

sc/√Es, ss/√Es

is orthonormal (by (30.82) and (30.84)),
it follows that under the null hypothesis Tc and Ts are independent variance-σ2

Having computed the density of (Tc, Ts) under both the null hypothesis (30.89) and
the alternative hypothesis (30.91), we can now derive the Pareto-optimal decision
rules. But before rushing to do so, we pause to note that both fTc,Ts|H=0(tc, ts)
and fTc,Ts|H=1(tc, ts) are computable from t (30.88). Consequently, so is their ratio,
and we conclude that

(30.94)
In analogy to the two methods we presented in Section 27.5, we can now proceed to
derive the Pareto-optimal pairs using two diﬀerent methods. The ﬁrst is to ignore
the suﬃciency of T and to work with the likelihood-ratio function

The second method is to compute the density of T under the two hypotheses and de-
rive the Pareto-optimal pairs via the likelihood-ratio function fT |H=0(t)/fT |H=1(t).
We shall use the ﬁrst method, but we shall nonetheless ﬁrst compute the densities
fT |H=0(·), fT |H=1(·), because those will be needed when we analyze the perfor-
mance of the proposed guessing rules. Under the null hypothesis, T is the sum of
the squares of two independent standard Gaussians (Tc/σ and Tc/σ). As such, it
has a central χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom (Section 19.8.1),
T ∼χ2

(the null hypothesis),
(30.96)
i.e., a mean-2 exponential distribution (Note 19.8.1):

30.9 A Noncoherent Detection Problem

To compute the distribution of T under the alternative hypothesis, we ﬁrst condi-
tion on Θ = θ, with the result that T is distributed as the sum of the squares
of two independent unit-variance Gaussians, where the ﬁrst, Tc/σ, is of mean
σ−1√Es cos θ and the second, Ts/σ, is of mean σ−1√Es sin θ.
Thus, under the
alternative hypothesis, the conditional distribution of T given Θ = θ is a non-
central χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter
Es/σ2 (Note 19.8.2). Since the parameters of this distribution do not depend on θ,
we conclude that, under the alternative hypothesis, T is independent of Θ and
T ∼χ2
2,Es/σ2
(the alternative hypothesis).
(30.98)
This concludes the derivation of the distribution of T under the two hypotheses.
We next derive the Pareto-optimal pairs using the ﬁrst method, i.e., by ignoring
the suﬃciency of T and by considering our observation as being the pair (Tc, Ts)
and using the likelihood-ratio function (30.95).
Under both hypotheses the joint density of (Tc, Ts) is positive ((30.89) and (30.91)),
so p∗
MD(0) = 1 (Lemma 30.4.1) and p∗
FA(0) = 1 (Lemma 30.4.2). The pairs (0, 1)
and (1, 0) are thus Pareto-optimal. Any guessing rule that guesses “H = 0” when-
ever LR(y) ≥Υ is Pareto-optimal, irrespective of the value of Υ ∈(0, ∞) (Propo-
sition 30.5.2). Using the explicit form of the likelihood-ratio function (30.95), we

υ ∈(0, ∞).
(30.100)
To each prespeciﬁed pFA ∈(0, 1), we can thus ﬁnd a corresponding υ ∈(0, ∞)
so that the Pareto-optimal rule (30.99e) will be of this false-alarm probability.
Consequently, as we vary υ over (0, ∞) we swipe over all Pareto-optimal rules of
nontrivial false alarm.
The probability of missed-detection of the rule (30.99e) is, by (30.98), the proba-
bility that a χ2
2,Es/σ2 RV does not exceed υ. Equivalently, it is the probability that
the square root of a χ2
2,Es/σ2 RV (which has a Rice distribution) does not exceed
√υ. Using (19.51) (with the substitution of Es/σ2 for λ and of √υ for x) we thus

Randomization Is Not Needed
We have seen that all the pairs that are Pareto-optimal with respect to the class
of randomized guessing rules can also be achieved by deterministic rules (Corol-
lary 30.5.7). Here we present a stronger result: any pair—be it Pareto-optimal
or not—that is achievable by a randomized guessing rule can also be achieved by
a deterministic one. Like the aforementioned result on Pareto-optimal pairs, this
result too relies heavily on the assumption that the observable Y has a density
under both hypotheses. This section’s main result can be stated as follows:
Proposition 30.10.1 (Rrnd = R). Every pair (pFA, pMD) that can be achieved by
some randomized rule can also be achieved by a deterministic rule:
Rrnd = R.
(30.103)
Since Rrnd ⊇R (30.15), to prove (30.103) it remains to prove that
Rrnd ⊆R,
(30.104)
i.e., that every pair that is achievable by a randomized rule can also be achieved
by a deterministic rule. The proof of this result relies on an important theorem

30.10 Randomization Is Not Needed

due to Alexey Liapunov (1911–1973) on the convexity of vector-valued measures.
To state the theorem we ﬁrst recall that a subset K of R2 is a convex set if for
every 0 < λ < 1 and every pair of tuples r1, r2 in K, the tuple λr1 + (1 −λ)r2 is
also in K. We can now state Liapunov’s theorem for our setting as follows:
Theorem 30.10.2 (Liapunov). Let f0(·) and f1(·) be two densities on Rn. The
subset of R2 comprising all pairs that can be expressed as
	
A
f0(y) dy,

A
f1(y) dy

for some (Lebesgue measurable) subset A of Rn is convex.
If a set K ⊆R2 is convex, then so is the set
'
1 −r(1), r(2)
:

r(1), r(2)
∈K
(
.
By using this observation, by substituting in Liapunov’s Theorem the set D (the
subset of Rn where we guess “H = 0”) for A, and by recalling the representa-
tions (30.3b) and (30.4b) of pFA and pMD we obtain:
Corollary 30.10.3 (R Is Convex). The set of pairs (pFA, pMD) that can be achieved
by deterministic guessing rules is convex.
Before we can prove the inclusion (30.104) using Corollary 30.10.3, we need some
more groundwork. Recall that in (30.9) we deﬁned p∗
MD(πFA) to be the least proba-
bility of missed-detection that can be achieved by a deterministic rule whose false-
alarm probability does not exceed πFA. We did not require that (πFA, p∗
MD(πFA))
be achievable. But we did show that (πFA, p∗
MD(πFA)) is in R (i.e., is achievable)
whenever πFA is in the range 0 ≤πFA ≤p∗
FA(0). (For πFA = 0 the result fol-
lows from Lemma 30.4.1; for 0 < πFA < p∗
FA(0) it follows from Proposition 30.5.5;
and for πFA = p∗
FA(0) it follows from Lemma 30.4.2.) We next use the convexity
of R to show that this also holds for p∗
FA(0) < πFA ≤1, i.e., that it holds for all
0 ≤πFA ≤1.6
Lemma 30.10.4. For every 0 ≤πFA ≤1, the pair

πFA, p∗
MD(πFA)

is achievable
by a deterministic guessing rule:

πFA, p∗
MD(πFA)

∈R,
0 ≤πFA ≤1.
(30.105)
Proof. For πFA = 0 the result follows from Lemma 30.4.1; for 0 < πFA < p∗
FA(0) it
follows from Proposition 30.5.5; and for πFA = p∗
FA(0) it follows from Lemma 30.4.2.
The remaining case is when πFA is in the range
p∗
FA(0) < πFA ≤1.
(30.106)
For such πFA we can express (πFA, 0) as a convex combination of (p∗
FA(0), 0) and
(1, 0), both of which are in R (the former by Lemma 30.4.2 and the latter by
6This result does not need the full power of Liapunov’s Theorem. We could have also proved
it using the technique we used in the proof of Proposition 30.5.5.

considering the deterministic guessing rule of always guessing “H = 1”).
The
convexity of R thus implies that (πFA, 0) is in R:
(πFA, 0) ∈R,
p∗
FA(0) < πFA ≤1.
(30.107)
For πFA in the range (30.106), p∗
MD(πFA) is zero (30.34), so (30.107) is equivalent
to

πFA, p∗


∈R,
p∗
FA(0) < πFA ≤1,
(30.108)
thus verifying the lemma in this range too.
Before we can prove (30.104) we also need the following symmetry result:
Proposition 30.10.5. Both R and Rrnd are invariant under rotation by 180 degrees
around the pair (1/2, 1/2):

(pFA, pMD) ∈R

⇐⇒

(1 −pFA, 1 −pMD) ∈R

,
(30.109)

(pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd

⇐⇒

(1 −pFA, 1 −pMD) ∈Rrnd

.
(30.110)
Proof. Consider ﬁrst Rrnd. To establish (30.110) it suﬃces to prove that

(pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd

=⇒

(1 −pFA, 1 −pMD) ∈Rrnd

,
(30.111)
because the reverse implication will then follow by applying (30.111) to the pair
(1 −pFA, 1 −pMD). To prove (30.111) suppose that (pFA, pMD) is achieved by the
randomized guessing rule determined by the function b(·). Consider now a new
rule that is determined by the function ¯b(·), where
¯b(y) = 1 −b(y),
y ∈Y.
Denoting the probability of false alarm of this new guessing rule by ¯pFA,
¯pFA =

MD,rnd(1 −pFA), which
is obtained from the graph of p∗
MD,rnd(·) by rotating it around the point (1/2, 1/2)
by 180 degrees.
Thus, the probabilities of error of the new rule are (1−pFA, 1−pMD), and the pair
is thus achievable. This concludes the proof of (30.111) and hence of (30.110).
The proof for R is very similar. The only diﬀerence is that the function b(·) and
hence also ¯b(·) are zero-one valued.
We next use Proposition 30.10.5 to show that if (pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd then we can
bound pMD from below and from above using the function p∗
MD,rnd(·) as follows:
p∗
MD,rnd(pFA) ≤pMD ≤1 −p∗
MD,rnd(1 −pFA),
(pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd.
(30.112)
The lower bound pMD ≥p∗
MD,rnd(pFA) follows directly from the deﬁnition (30.16)
of p∗
MD,rnd(pFA), which implies that no achievable pair of false alarm pFA can have
a missed-detection probability smaller than p∗
MD,rnd(pFA). More interesting is the
upper bound, i.e., the statement that

(pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd

=⇒

pMD ≤1 −p∗
MD,rnd(1 −pFA)

.
(30.113)
This relation is illustrated in Figure 30.5. The shadowed region corresponds to
the achievable region Rrnd. The dashed line is the graph of p∗
MD,rnd(·), and the
irregularly-dashed line is the graph of pFA 	→1 −p∗
MD,rnd(1 −pFA). (It is obtained
from the dashed line by rotating it by 180 degrees around the point (1/2, 1/2).)
No achievable pair lies above the irregularly-dashed line.
To prove (30.113), suppose that (pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd.
Proposition 30.10.5 then
implies that also (1 −pFA, 1 −pMD) ∈Rrnd. This and the deﬁnition of p∗
MD,rnd(1 −
pFA) imply that p∗
MD,rnd(1−pFA) ≤1−pMD and hence pMD ≤1−p∗
MD,rnd(1−pFA).
Having established (30.112), we now recall that the functions p∗
MD,rnd(·) and p∗
MD(·)
are identical (Corollary 30.5.6), and we can thus substitute p∗
MD(·) for p∗

in (30.112) to obtain
p∗
MD(pFA) ≤pMD ≤1 −p∗
MD(1 −pFA),
(pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd.
(30.114)
The inequalities in (30.114) imply that every (pFA, pMD) ∈Rrnd can be written as
a convex combination of the pairs

pFA, p∗
MD(pFA)

and

pFA, 1 −p∗
MD(1 −pFA)

.
Once we show that these two pairs are both in R, it will follow from the convexity
of R (Corollary 30.10.3) that this convex combination is in R, and (30.104) will
be established.
Beginning with the ﬁrst pair, we note that

pFA, p∗
MD(pFA)

∈R,
0 ≤πFA ≤1,
(30.115)
by Lemma 30.10.4, i.e., by (30.105). As to the second pair, we note that substi-
tuting 1 −pFA for pFA in (30.115) yields

1 −pFA, p∗
MD(1 −pFA)

∈R,
0 ≤πFA ≤1,
(30.116)
from which the achievability of the second pair, namely,

pFA, 1 −p∗
MD(1 −pFA)

∈R,
0 ≤πFA ≤1
(30.117)
follows using Proposition 30.10.5. We have thus established the achievability of
the two pairs using deterministic guessing rules and have thus concluded the proof
of (30.104).
As we have noted, the assumption that Y has a density under both hypotheses is
essential for R to equal Rrnd. (We used this assumption in the proof of Proposi-
tion 30.5.5, and it is also key in Liapunov’s Theorem.) To see this, consider the
case where under both hypotheses the observation is deterministically equal to 17.
In this case the observation is clearly useless. Depending on whether or not we
guess “H = 0” after observing 17, we either achieve (pFA, pMD) equal to (1, 0) or
to (0, 1). There are no other pairs that are achievable with a deterministic rule.
However, with randomized guessing rules we can guess “H = 0” with probability b
and thus achieve all pairs of the form (1 −b, b) where b is any number satisfying
0 ≤b ≤1.
30.11
The Big Picture
To see the big picture, we collect here the key results on Pareto-optimal pairs
and the rules that achieve them. In some places we also expand. For example,
Theorem 30.11.1 (ii) explains how we drew the achievable regions in the diﬀerent
ﬁgures in this chapter. As noted earlier, some of the results rely heavily on the
assumption that the observable has a density under both hypotheses.
Theorem 30.11.1 (Achievable Pairs and Pareto-Optimal Pairs).
(i) Every pair of error probabilities that is achievable by a randomized guessing
rule can also be achieved by a deterministic one:

Proof. Part (i) is from Proposition 30.10.1. As to Part (ii), the convexity result
is from Corollary 30.10.3. That every pair (pFA, pMD) in R must satisfy (30.119)
follows from (30.114). And that every pair (pFA, pMD) satisfying (30.119) must be
in R follows from the convexity of R, because every such pair can be written as
a convex combination of the pairs

both of which are in R by (30.115) and (30.117).
As to Part (iii), all the pairs in (30.120) are Pareto-optimal by Lemma 30.4.1,
Lemma 30.5.4, and Lemma 30.4.2. There are no additional Pareto-optimal pairs
of false alarm in the interval [0, p∗
FA(0)] by Note 30.3.1, and there are none outside
this interval by Corollary 30.4.5.
Part (iv) is from Proposition 30.5.2. We ﬁnally prove Part (v). The achievability of
every Pareto-optimal pair using a deterministic likelihood-ratio test follows from
Part (iii), Proposition 30.5.5, and Proposition 30.8.1. The achievability using a
randomized likelihood-ratio test that bases its decision only on LR(yobs) follows
from Part (iii), Lemma 30.5.4, and Proposition 30.8.1.

p∗
MD(πFA) = 0.
(30.124)
(vi) The function p∗

over the closed interval [0, 1].
Proof. Part (i) is a restatement of Corollary 30.5.6; see (30.63).
Part (ii) is
a restatement of Lemma 30.10.4; see (30.105).
Part (iii) is a restatement of

sition 30.5.5. Part (v) is a restatement of Corollary 30.4.4; see (30.34).
We next turn to Part (vi). Monotonicity is proved by noting that increasing the
maximal-allowed false-alarm probability enlarges (or leaves unchanged) the class
of allowed decision rules in (30.8b) and hence can only decrease (or not change) the
least probability of missed-detection in the class (30.9). Convexity is a consequence
of the convexity of R and the achievability of (πFA, p∗

The proof of continuity is a bit technical, so we will be terse.
Convexity over
the closed interval [0, 1] implies continuity over the open interval (0, 1) (see, for
example, (Royden and Fitzpatrick, 2010, Section 6.6, Corollary 17), so it remains
to establish continuity at the end points. We ﬁrst consider the endpoint πFA = 1,
where continuity follows from monotonicity and convexity: Monotonicity implies
that
lim
πFA↑1 p∗
MD(πFA) ≥p∗
MD(1).
(30.128)
And convexity implies that (30.128) must hold with the reverse inequality, because

This combines with (30.128) to establish continuity at πFA = 1.
It thus remains to establish continuity at the endpoint πFA = 0, i.e., to prove
lim
πFA↓0 p∗
MD(πFA) = p∗
MD(0).
(30.131)
Monotonicity implies that the above limit exists, and we now proceed to show
that it equals p∗
MD(0). To this end, consider the likelihood-ratio test that guesses
“H = 0” whenever LR(yobs) > ϵ, and denote its false-alarm and missed-detection
probabilities by pFA(ϵ) and pMD(ϵ):
pFA(ϵ) = P0

0 ≤LR(Y) ≤ϵ

,
(30.132)
pMD(ϵ) = P1

LR(Y) > ϵ

,
(30.133)
where P1[·] is deﬁned as in (30.41d) but with the density f0 replaced by f1. Since
this is a likelihood-ratio test, the pair

pFA(ϵ), pMD(ϵ)

is Pareto-optimal (Propo-
sition 30.5.2), and hence, by (30.10),
p∗

pFA(ϵ)

ϵ > 0.
(30.134)
We next study the limits of pFA(ϵ) and pMD(ϵ) as ϵ ↓0. Starting with the former,
lim
ϵ↓0 pFA(ϵ) = lim
ϵ↓0 P0

0 ≤LR(Y) ≤ϵ

= P0

LR(Y) = 0

= 0,
(30.135)
where the last equality follows from (30.42). As to the latter,
lim
ϵ↓0 pMD(ϵ) = lim

LR(Y) > ϵ

LR(Y) > 0

30.12
Relative Entropy
Any useful lower bound on the missed-detection probability must also take into
account the false-alarm probability, because we can always achieve zero pMD by
ignoring the observation and guessing that the target is present. In this section we
shall derive a necessary condition that all achievable pairs (pFA, pMD) must satisfy.
The condition will help us to understand the trade-oﬀbetween the two types of
error, and it will often allow us to rule out the possibility that both are very low.
The condition will be expressed in terms of the relative entropy between the
densities of the observable under the two hypotheses.
Relative entropy, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence or divergence,
is central to Statistics, Probability, and Information Theory. It can be deﬁned
between any pair of probability distributions, but we will focus on two special
cases only: when both distributions have densities, and when both are deﬁned over
a ﬁnite set. In the next deﬁnition and, in fact, throughout, we adopt the convention

0 ln 0
β = 0,
β ≥0

and


Deﬁnition 30.12.1 (Relative Entropy).
(i) Let p = (p1, . . . , pn) and q = (q1, . . . , qn) be n-tuples having nonnegative
entries that sum to one. The relative entropy is deﬁned as
D(p∥q) ≜

(30.141)
(ii) Let f(·) and g(·) be probability density functions on Rn. The relative entropy
is deﬁned as7
D(f∥g) ≜

f(x) ln f(x)
g(x) dx.
(30.142)
Relative entropy is not symmetric: D(p∥q) is typically diﬀerent from D(q∥p).
Example 30.12.2 (The Relative Entropy between Equi-Variance Gaussians).
Suppose that f(·) is the density of the N

μ1, σ2
distribution, and g(·) is the
density of the N

μ2, σ2
distribution, where σ > 0 and μ1, μ2 ∈R. Then

generally, the integral

A

should be interpreted as follows: If the integrand is +∞on a subset of A of positive Lebesgue
measure, then the integral is deﬁned as being +∞. (This is reasonable, because the contribution
of the other points in A to the integral is lower-bounded by −1; see Exercise 30.14.) Otherwise,
the integral is computed by excluding from A the points where the integrand is inﬁnite.

A key property of D(p∥q) is that it is nonnegative, and that it is zero if, and only
if, the tuples p and q are identical. Likewise for densities, D(f∥g) is nonnegative
and is equal to zero if, and only if, the densities f(·) and g(·) diﬀer on a set of
Lebesgue measure zero. We shall only prove nonnegativity:
Theorem 30.12.3 (Relative Entropy Is Nonnegative).
(i) If p and q are as in Deﬁnition 30.12.1, then
D(p∥q) ≥0.
(30.144)
(ii) If f(·) and g(·) are probability densities on Rn, then
D(f∥g) ≥0.
(30.145)
Proof. We shall only prove Part (ii); the proof of the discrete version merely re-
quires replacing the integrals with sums. The key is the inequality
ln ξ ≤ξ −1,
ξ > 0,
(30.146)
which also holds when ξ is zero provided that we interpret ln 0 as −∞. Starting

where the second line follows from the identity −ln(a/b) = ln(b/a); the third
from (30.146) by substituting g(x)/f(x) for ξ; the fourth from the linearity of
integration; the ﬁfth because extending the domain of integration does not change
the integral if we only add points where the integrand is zero; the sixth because
f(·) is a density (and hence integrates to one) and because g(·) is nonnegative so
extending the domain of integration cannot decrease the integral; and the ﬁnal
equality because, being a density, g(·) integrates to one.
We call the next inequality the “Log-Integral Inequality” because the standard
name for its discrete counterpart is the “Log-Sum Inequality” (Cover and Thomas,
2006, Chapter 2, Section 7, Theorem 2.7.1).

We shall prove the inequality for the case where both a and b are positive. (If a is
zero, then both sides of the inequality are zero, and if a is positive and b is zero,
then both sides are inﬁnite.) Deﬁne the two densities

beneﬁt of readers who have skipped the proposition’s proof, those will be considered later too.

probabilities (pFA, pMD) must satisfy irrespective of the set D that deﬁnes them.
One necessary condition is in terms of D(f0∥f1) and the other in terms of D(f1∥f0).
To derive the ﬁrst necessary condition we apply the Log-Integral Inequality twice.
In both applications we substitute in (30.147) the densities f0(·) for f(·) and f1(·)
for g(·). In the ﬁrst application, we substitute the decision region D for A to obtain

(30.153)
Before turning to the second necessary condition, we next argue that (30.153)
also holds for randomized guessing rules. As we have seen in Section 20.6, any
randomized guessing rule that guesses “H = 0” with probability b(yobs) can be
viewed as a deterministic rule that bases its decision on an observation consisting of
the pair (yobs, θobs) ∈Rn×[0, 1] and that guesses “H = 0” whenever θobs ≤b(yobs),
where Θ ∼U

is the outcome of a uniform random-number generator that is
independent of the observation so the corresponding two densities are
f0(y) I{0 ≤θ ≤1},
f1(y) I{0 ≤θ ≤1}.

The Radar Problem
Applying the result on deterministic rules to the setting where the densities are
those in (30.154) and using (30.155) establishes the bound for randomized rules.
Condition (30.152) was derived from the Log-Integral Inequality by substituting
the densities f0(·) for f(·) and f1(·) for g(·). A diﬀerent condition can be derived
in a similar way by swapping f0(·) and f1(·), i.e., by substituting in (30.147) f1(·)
for f(·) and f0(·) for g(·). If we substitute the decision region D for A we obtain

Like (30.152) this bound too can be extended to randomized rules. To summarize:

able by some possibly-randomized decision rule, then

As an example of the use of Theorem 30.12.5, we next revisit the Gaussian problem
we discussed in Section 30.6. Using the expression for the relative entropy between
two Gaussians (30.143) we conclude that in this example D(f0∥f1) happens to equal
D(f1∥f0) and both are equal to A2/(2σ2). We thus conclude from the theorem that,

These necessary conditions are depicted in Figure 30.6. The darkly-shaded area cor-
responds to the achievable pairs. Lightly shaded are the pairs that satisfy (30.161a)
(Figure 30.6 (a)) and those that satisfy (30.161b) (Figure 30.6 (b)). In this very
special case, D(f1∥f0) is equal to D(f0∥f1), so Condition (30.161b) is identical to
the result of swapping pMD and pFA in (30.161a). The lightly-shaded regions in
Figure 30.6 can thus be obtained from each other by reﬂection with respect to the

We have not considered the radar problem for signals with unknown parameters.
Good starting points for the literature on this are (Poor, 1994) and (Helstrom,

Stein, 2009, Chapter 16, Section 2). For various extensions of Liapunov’s Theorem
see (Karlin and Studden, 1966, Chapter VIII, Section 12), and for a simpliﬁed

A Glimpse at Discrete-Time Signal
Processing
Once we have reduced the detection problem from one where the observable is a
continuous-time SP to one where it is a random vector, we can harness the power of
digital signal processing to form our guess. This approach is particularly suitable
for intersymbol interference channels—“ISI channels”—which we shall encounter in
Chapter 32, and where the required digital signal processing is quite sophisticated.
The more basic and more general elements of discrete-time signal processing are
treated here. The main concepts are similar to their continuous-time counterparts,
so the reading should be fairly easy.
31.1
Discrete-Time Filters
In Chapter 5 we discussed the convolution between waveforms and the result of ﬁl-
tering them. Here we discuss the analogous results for bi-inﬁnite sequences. In view
of the notation we adopted for discrete-time stochastic processes (Section 12.2), we
denote the bi-inﬁnite sequence . . . , a−2, a−1, a0, a1, a2, . . . by

aν, ν ∈Z

or simply
by (aν). But sometimes we use ν 	→aν because a bi-inﬁnite sequence is a mapping
from the integers to the real or complex ﬁeld. For this reason we shall also some-
times denote the sequence by a. In that case the sequence ~a maps ν to a−ν and is
thus the “mirror image” of a.
We say that a sequence (aν) is absolutely summable if
∞

ν=−∞
|aν| < ∞.
Here |·| denotes the absolute value for real sequences and the modulus for complex
sequences. The class of all absolutely summable sequences is denoted ℓ1. This
notation does not make it explicit whether the sequences are real or complex. A
sequence (aν) is square summable if
∞

ν=−∞
|aν|2 < ∞,

and the class of square-summable sequences is denoted ℓ2. Note that
ℓ1 ⊂ℓ2,
(31.1)
because if a sequence is in ℓ1 then all but a ﬁnite number of its elements are of
modulus smaller than one, and if a modulus is smaller than one, then it cannot
exceed its square:
|ξ|2 ≤|ξ|,

|ξ| < 1

.
The inclusion in (31.1) is strict: there are sequences, such as ν 	→1/(|ν|+1), which
are in ℓ2 but not in ℓ1.
The convolution of the bi-inﬁnite sequences (aν) and (bν) is a bi-inﬁnite sequence
that we denote (aν) ⋆(bν) or a ⋆b. Its η-th symbol is denoted

(aν) ⋆(bν)

η
or
(a ⋆b)η
and is formally given by
(a ⋆b)η =
∞

ν=−∞
aν bη−ν.
(31.2)
The convolution of two square-summable sequences (aν), (bν) ∈ℓ2 is deﬁned at
every η ∈Z and is a bounded sequence. Indeed, the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality
for sequences (Exercise 3.12) shows that for sequences (aν), (bν) ∈ℓ2 and any η ∈Z
the sequence ν 	→aν bη−ν is absolutely summable and its sum, which is (a ⋆b)η,
can be bounded by

ν∈Z
|aν|2

1/2	 
ν∈Z
|bν|2

,
η ∈Z.
(31.3)
Since ℓ1 ⊂ℓ2, the convolution of two absolutely summable sequences is also always
deﬁned. In fact, as we next show, the result is absolutely summable with

A Glimpse at Discrete-Time Signal Processing
All the properties listed in Theorem 5.6.1 hold whenever the sequences involved
are in ℓ1. To those we add that if (eν) is the sequence deﬁned by
eν ≜I{ν = 0},
ν ∈Z,
(31.5)
then
(aν) ⋆(eν) = (aν).
(31.6)
In analogy to Deﬁnition 11.2.1, we deﬁne the self-similarity sequence as follows:
Deﬁnition 31.1.1 (Self-Similarity Sequence). The self-similarity sequence Raa(·)
of a (possibly-complex) square-summable sequence a is deﬁned as
Raa(η) ≜

A
discrete-time ﬁlter of impulse response (hν) is a device that when fed
the input sequence (aν) produces the output sequence (aν) ⋆(hν). A discrete-time
ﬁlter is said to be stable if its impulse response is absolutely summable. It is said
to be causal if hν is zero whenever ν < 0.
The Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) of an absolutely summable
sequence a ∈ℓ1 is discussed in Appendix B. It is denoted ua and is the mapping
from R to C
ua: θ 	→

ν∈Z
aν e−i2πνθ.
The frequency response of a stable discrete-time ﬁlter of impulse response (hν)
is the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform of its impulse response: it is the mapping
from R to C
uh: θ 	→

ν∈Z
hν e−i2πνθ.
(31.8)
This function is continuous and periodic with its value at θ + 1 being equal to its
value at θ. Consequently, it is often restricted to the interval I, where, as in (A.1),
I ≜
'
θ ∈R : −1
2 ≤θ < 1
2
(
.
(31.9)
From its restriction to I we can, of course, recover its value everywhere via the
periodic extension: The periodic extension SP of a function S: I →C, is a
function that agrees with S on I and that satisﬁes SP(θ + 1) = SP(θ) for every
θ ∈R. Thus,
SP(ν + θ) = S(θ),

A stable discrete-time ﬁlter of impulse response (hν) is said to have a stable
inverse if there exists a sequence (aν) ∈ℓ1 such that (hν) ⋆(aν) =

Theorem 31.1.2 (Existence of a Stable Inverse). If the frequency response of a
stable discrete-time ﬁlter is never zero, then the ﬁlter has a stable inverse.
Proof. See (Rudin, 1987, Chapter 18, Theorem 18.21).
31.2
Processing Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes
We next discuss linear functionals of discrete-time stochastic processes as well as the
result of ﬁltering such processes. We treat the real and complex cases separately,
with the latter addressed in Section 31.4.
31.2.1
Linear Functionals of Discrete-Time SPs
If an absolutely summable sequence is multiplied term-by-term by a bounded se-
quence, then the result is also absolutely summable. But what if the latter is only
bounded in some probabilistic sense? The next proposition shows that this is often
enough. In this proposition we require that the SP (Xν) have a bounded second
moment, i.e., that there exist some γ > 0 that upper-bounds E[X2
ν] for every
ν ∈Z:
E

X2
ν

≤γ,
ν ∈Z.
(31.12)
Note 31.2.1. Every WSS SP is also of bounded second moment.
Proof. If

is WSS, then

E[X0]

and (31.12) thus holds (with equality) with
γ =

E[X0]
2 + Var[X0] .
The following proposition is the discrete-time counterpart of Proposition 25.10.1.
Proposition 31.2.2 (Linear Functional of a Discrete-Time SP). Let (Xν) be a SP
of bounded second moment, and let (aν) be an absolutely summable real sequence.

requires replacing integrals with sums. It is thus omitted.
We will need the following corollary when we discuss the time-η value

of the convolution (Xν) ⋆(hν). It shows that we can ﬁnd an event of probability
zero outside of which the convolution sum converges at all (integer) epochs: “one
null event ﬁts all.” It has no continuous-time counterpart because it relies heavily
on the fact that, when time is discrete, the set of epochs is countable.

Proof. For any η ∈Z we can substitute ν 	→hη−ν for

to obtain from Part (i) that the event
1
ω ∈Ω :

has probability zero. And since the union of a countable collection of events having
probability zero is also of probability zero (Corollary 21.5.2 (i)), the event in (31.21)
must also have probability zero.
31.2.2
Filtering Discrete-Time SPs
With the aid of Corollary 31.2.3, we can now deﬁne the convolution between a WSS
SP and a deterministic absolutely summable sequence, i.e., the response of a stable
ﬁlter to a WSS input. This is the discrete-time counterpart to Deﬁnition 25.13.1.
Deﬁnition 31.2.4 (Filtering a Discrete-Time SP). The convolution (Xν) ⋆(hν)
between a discrete-time SP of bounded second moment (Xν) and an absolutely
summable sequence (hν) is the SP (Yν) that is deﬁned as
Yη(ω) =
⎧
⎨

ν∈Z
Xν(ω) hη−ν

(31.22b)
As in Deﬁnition 25.13.1, the deﬁnition of the convolution for ω in N is arbitrary
and was chosen for concreteness. Ignoring the minor technical issue of how the
convolution is deﬁned when ω ∈N, the convolution is “almost linear” in the sense
of Lemma 25.10.3. This minor technicality will be ignored in the future.
As we next argue, the convolution is “almost” associative. By this we mean that for
ω’s outside an event whose probability is zero, the following two calculations yield
identical sequences. In the ﬁrst calculation we convolve the sequence ν 	→Xν(ω)
with (hν) and then convolve the result with the sequence (gν).
In the second
we convolve ν 	→Xν(ω) with the result of convolving (hν) with (gν), i.e., with
(hν) ⋆(gν).
Proposition 31.2.5 (The Convolution Is “almost” Associative). Let

Xν

be of
bounded second moment, and let the deterministic sequences h and g be absolutely
summable. Then there exists an event N of probability zero such that for every


⋆h

⋆g =

ν 	→Xν(ω)

⋆(h ⋆g).
(31.23)
Proof. Since h and g are absolutely summable, so are the sequences ν 	→|hν| and
ν 	→|gν|, which we denote |h| and |g|. Consequently, their convolution is also
absolutely summable, i.e.,
|h| ⋆|g| ∈ℓ1,

Discrete-Time Gaussian SPs
Discrete-time Gaussian stochastic processes are deﬁned like their continuous-time
counterparts (Deﬁnition 25.3.1):

is said
to be Gaussian if for every positive integer m and every choice of the integers
ν1, . . . , νm, the random vector

is a Gaussian vector.
In analogy to Proposition 25.11.1 and Theorem 25.12.1 we have:
Theorem 31.2.8 (Linear Functionals of a Discrete-Time Gaussian SP). Let


then the m random variables

Since

is a Gaussian RV (Theorem 23.6.17). Since, by Proposition 31.2.2, Sn converges

31.3
Discrete-Time Whitening Filters
A whitening ﬁlter is lossless in the sense of Corollary 31.2.6 and allows us to trans-
form a Gaussian SP with memory to one that is memoryless (IID). For this to
hold, the magnitude of the ﬁlter’s frequency response must be inversely propor-
tional to the square root of the SP’s PSD; the phase is immaterial. Consequently,
the whitening ﬁlter, when it exists, is not unique.
Deﬁnition 31.3.1 (Discrete-Time Whitening Filter). A discrete-time whiten-
ing ﬁlter for a WSS SP (Xν) of PSD SXX is a stable ﬁlter whose frequency re-
sponse uh satisﬁes

31.3 Discrete-Time Whitening Filters
795
The existence of a whitening ﬁlter is a technical issue. It is natural to assume that
the PSD of the SP be positive so that the square root of its reciprocal be ﬁnite.
But we typically require a bit more, because we need to guarantee that this square
root correspond to the magnitude of some stable ﬁlter.
The next theorem provides suﬃcient conditions for the existence of a whitening
ﬁlter. In its statement we shall require that some function be absolutely continuous
on ¯I.2 Most readers have probably not encountered this notion before, and it is
inessential here. Interested readers can read up on this topic, for example, in (Roy-
den and Fitzpatrick, 2010, Section 6.4). Here we merely note that every function
that is continuously diﬀerentiable on [a, b] is also absolutely continuous on [a, b].
And to deal with functions that are continuous but only piecewise continuously
diﬀerentiable, we note that if a < b < c and if g(·) is absolutely continuous on both
[a, b] and [b, c], then g(·) is absolutely continuous on [a, c]. This extends to any
ﬁnite number of intervals [a, b1], [b1, b2], . . . , [bn, c].
Finally, we note that if g(·) is absolutely continuous on [a, b] then it is continuous
on [a, b] and that, excluding a set of Lebesgue measure zero, it is diﬀerentiable at
every point in [a, b]. Moreover, irrespective of how we deﬁne its derivative g′ in the
exception set

A Glimpse at Discrete-Time Signal Processing
Proof. Before presenting the details, we give an overview of the proof. Our ap-
proach is to deﬁne hν to be the (−ν)-th Fourier Series Coeﬃcient of the mapping

ν ∈Z.
(31.33)
(When S is symmetric the ﬁlter is thus real.) From this it will then be merely a
technicality to show that this ﬁlter has the desired discrete-time frequency response,
i.e., that
∞

ν=−∞
hν e−i2πνθ =


S(θ)
,
θ ∈I.
(31.34)
(Some technical assumptions are needed for (31.33) to imply (31.34).)
The other technical issue will be to show that the ﬁlter is stable, i.e., that
∞

ν=−∞
|hν| < ∞.
(31.35)
The existence of a stable inverse will then follow from (31.34) using Theorem 31.1.2,
because the RHS of (31.34) is never zero.
To address some of the above technicalities, we begin by showing that the theorem’s
hypotheses guarantee that the mapping (31.32) is absolutely continuous on ¯I. Since
S(θ) is positive and continuous on ¯I, we can ﬁnd constants smin and smax such that
0 < smin ≤S(θ) ≤smax,
θ ∈¯I.
(31.36)
Since smin is positive, the function ξ 	→ξ−1
2 is continuously diﬀerentiable on
[smin, smax]. And S(·) is absolutely continuous on ¯I by assumption. Consequently,
since the composition of a Lipschitz function with an absolutely continuous function
is absolutely continuous (Royden and Fitzpatrick, 2010, Section 6.4, Exercise 44),
(Bogachev, 2007, Section 5.3, Lemma 5.3.2), the mapping (31.32) is absolutely
continuous on ¯I.
Having established that the mapping (31.32) is absolutely continuous on ¯I, we next
show that its derivative is square integrable. By the chain rule for diﬀerentiation
(Rudin, 1976, Chapter 5, Theorem 5.5), the derivative of the mapping (31.32) is
−1
2 S(θ)−3
2 dS(θ)
dθ
(31.37)
at every θ at which S(·) is diﬀerentiable. Since, by assumption, S(·) is absolutely
continuous, it is diﬀerentiable for all θ ∈¯I outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero,
and the derivative of the mapping (31.32) is thus given by (31.37) for all θ ∈¯I
outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.

Using (31.36) we thus conclude that, outside a subset of ¯I of Lebesgue measure

This, combined with the theorem’s hypothesis that the derivative of S(·) is square
integrable over ¯I implies that the derivative of the mapping (31.32) is also square
integrable.
We are now ready to tackle the technicalities. Since the mapping (31.32) is abso-
lutely continuous and its derivative square integrable, its Fourier Series Coeﬃcients
are absolutely summable (Katznelson, 2004, the theorem in Chapter I, Section 6.2)
and (31.35) is thus established.
As to (31.34), it simply follows from the absolute continuity of the mapping (31.32)
(Katznelson, 2004, the corollary in Chapter II, Section 2.2).
The existence of a stable inverse follows from Theorem 31.1.2.
31.4
Processing Discrete-Time Complex Processes
Linear functionals of complex stochastic processes are very similar to their real
counterparts. But proper complex stochastic processes have no real counterparts
and thus require some attention. The same applies to the ﬁltering of such complex
stochastic processes.
As in the real case, we shall need an assumption on the second moment of the
CSP. We say that a CSP (Zν) is of bounded second moment if there exists
some γ > 0 that upper-bounds E

|Zν|2
for every ν ∈Z:
E

|Zν|2
≤γ,
ν ∈Z.
(31.38)
Every WSS CSP satisﬁes this condition because if (Zν) is WSS then
E

|Zν|2
=
E[Zν]
2 + Var[Zν]
=
E[Z0]
2 + Var[Z0] ,
and (31.38) thus holds with
γ =
E[Z0]
2 + Var[Z0] .
Note also that (31.38) implies
E

(Re(Zν))2
, E

(Im(Zν))2
≤γ,
(31.39)
so the real and imaginary parts of

Zν

satisfy our underlying assumption for real
stochastic processes (31.12).
Finally note that, by the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for complex random variables
(Exercise 17.9), Inequality (31.38) implies
E[ZνZ∗
ν′]
 ≤γ,
ν, ν′ ∈Z.

A Glimpse at Discrete-Time Signal Processing
The deﬁnition of a Gaussian SP requires little change. It builds on the notion of a
complex Gaussian vector (Deﬁnition 24.3.6):
Deﬁnition 31.4.1 (Discrete-Time Gaussian CSP). A discrete-time CSP (Zν) is
said to be Gaussian if for every positive integer m and every choice of the integers
ν1, . . . , νm, the random vector

Zν1, . . . , Zνm
T
is a complex Gaussian vector.
Also recall the deﬁnitions of a wide-sense stationary (Deﬁnition 17.5.3) and of a
proper (Deﬁnition 17.5.4) discrete-time CSP.
The following theorem is the complex counterpart of Proposition 31.2.2 and The-
orem 31.2.8. Note the additional part pertaining to proper CSPs.
Theorem 31.4.2 (Linear Functional of a CSP). Let (aν) be an absolutely summable
complex sequence, and let the CSP (Zν) be of bounded second moment.

where the second inequality follows from (31.40). The RHS of (31.48) tends to
zero, because (aν) was assumed to be absolutely summable. Consequently, since
its LHS is nonnegative, it too must tend to zero as n tends to inﬁnity.

A Glimpse at Discrete-Time Signal Processing
Part (iv) can be proved as follows: Since (Zν) is proper, the vector

Z−n, . . . , Z−1, Z0, Z1, . . . , Zn
T
(31.49)
is a proper complex random vector (Deﬁnition 17.5.4). Consequently, if we de-
ﬁne Wn as the partial sum
Wn =
n

ν=−n
aν Zν,
then, being a linear functional of the above proper vector, Wn must be a proper
CRV (Proposition 17.4.2). This combines with the fact that E

|W −Wn|2
→0
(Part (iii)) to imply that W must also be proper (Proposition 17.6.1).
As to (v), we note that since (Zν) is a Gaussian CSP, the real SP
. . . , Re(Z−1), Im(Z−1), Re(Z0), Im(Z0), Re(Z1), Im(Z1), . . .
(31.50)
must be Gaussian. By (31.39), it is of bounded second moment. And since Re(Z)
and Im(Z) are linear functionals of this Gaussian SP, they must be jointly Gaussian
by Theorem 31.2.8 (ii).
We can deﬁne the ﬁltering of a discrete-time CSP like we did in the real case in
Deﬁnition 31.2.4. In analogy to Theorem 31.2.9 we have:
Theorem 31.4.3 (Filtering a Discrete-Time CSP). Let (Zν) be a centered WSS
discrete-time CSP of autocovariance function KZZ, and let (hν) be an absolutely

Proof. Parts (i), (ii), and (iii) are similar to those in Theorem 31.2.9, so we shall
only prove Part (iv). Recalling Deﬁnition 17.5.4, we set out to prove that E[Yν Yν′]

Additional Reading
Digital Signal Processing is a huge ﬁeld, and we have only presented the very
basics that we shall need in Chapter 32 to study the Linearly-Dispersive Channel.
Interested readers can consult (Porat, 2008) and (Pourahmadi, 2001) for much
more. Our treatment of the whitening ﬁlter is a bit diﬀerent from the standard
one because we require that the ﬁlter be stable, whereas other authors often only
require that its impulse response be square summable.

Exercise 31.1 (Time- and Frequency-Limited Sequences). Prove the discrete-time coun-

where η is some positive integer, and if its DTFT ua(θ) is zero whenever ξ ≤|θ| < 1/2,
where ξ ∈[0, 1/2), then the sequence must be the all-zero sequence.
Hint: Recall the proof of Theorem 15.4.1.

The Linearly-Dispersive Channel
The linearly-dispersive channel—also known as the intersymbol interfer-
ence channel or ISI channel—ﬁlters its input and adds white Gaussian noise to
the result. It serves, inter alia, as a model for communication over copper wires
as in communications over telephone lines.
Such a channel is depicted in Fig-
ure 32.1. In this chapter we shall discuss PAM (Sections 32.2 and 32.3) and QAM
(Section 32.4) over such channels with special emphasis on the receiver structure.
In Figure 32.1 and throughout this chapter we use the subscript “c” for continuous-
time waveforms, e.g., xc for the channel input and hc for the ﬁlter’s impulse re-
sponse. This is to avoid confusion with a related discrete-time channel that we
shall encounter later. We assume throughout that the ﬁlter is stable, i.e., that hc
is integrable:
hc ∈L1.

We have thus reduced the continuous-time linearly-dispersive channel with PAM
signaling to a discrete-time ISI channel whose time-ℓoutput Yℓis
Yℓ= α

ℓ′=−∞
Xℓ′ hℓ−ℓ′ + Zℓ,
ℓ∈Z,
(32.22)
where α is a positive constant (32.18); the sequence (hk) (32.20) is absolutely
summable; the noise sequence (Zℓ) is IID N(0, 1) and independent of D; the sym-
bol Xℓis zero whenever ℓ∈Z \ {1, . . . , n}; and all the quantities are real. We
refer to hκ as the κ-th ISI coeﬃcient, and to the sequence (hκ) as the ISI
coeﬃcients.
We emphasize that the ISI coeﬃcients (hκ) of (32.20) are determined not only
by the pulse shape gc and the channel response hc (through pc): they are also
inﬂuenced by the choice of the whitening ﬁlter, which is not unique.
Diﬀerent
choices of the whitening ﬁlter lead to diﬀerent ISI coeﬃcients.
The coeﬃcients (hκ) corresponding to positive values of κ are called postcursor
coeﬃcients because through them the symbol Xℓ′ inﬂuences Yℓfor ℓ> ℓ′, i.e.,
for values of ℓthat are in the “future” relative to ℓ′. For example, if h1 is nonzero,
then Xℓ′ inﬂuences the future output Yℓ′+1 because, by (32.22),
α−1
Yℓ′+1 −Zℓ′+1

= · · · + h1Xℓ′ + h0Xℓ′+1 + · · · .
(32.23)
Similarly, the coeﬃcients (hκ) corresponding to negative values of κ are called
precursor coeﬃcients because through them the symbol Xℓ′ inﬂuences Yℓfor
ℓ< ℓ′, i.e., for values of ℓthat are in the “past” relative to ℓ′. For example, if h−1
is nonzero, then Xℓ′ inﬂuences the past output Yℓ′−1 because, by (32.22),
α−1
Yℓ′−1 −Zℓ′−1

= · · · + h0Xℓ′−1 + h−1Xℓ′ + · · · .

Postulating a Model
Engineers are sometimes reluctant to implement the MAP rule, either because the
implementation is too complex or because they seek a one-for-all solution that
works in many diﬀerent scenarios. To ﬁnd a reasonable guessing rule, they some-
times postulate a diﬀerent set of densities { ˜fY|M=m(·)} (perhaps simpler) and

Intersymbol Interference
a diﬀerent prior {˜πm}, and they then implement the MAP for the “postulated
model,” i.e., the guessing rule that guesses “M = ˜m” whenever ˜m achieves
max
m′∈M ˜πm′ ˜fY|M=m′(yobs)
(32.26)
(with ties being resolved arbitrarily). In other words, they pretend that the densi-
ties and prior are { ˜fY|M=m(·)} and {˜πm}—knowing full-well that they are not—
and they then implement the MAP for this “pretend model.”
For example, if ˜fY|M=m(·) is the same as fY|M=m(·) for every m ∈M and if {˜πm}
is uniform, then this approach leads to the ML rule (Sections 20.8 and 21.3.4).
More interesting, of course, is when the postulated densities are diﬀerent from the
true ones.
We shall refer to the postulated densities and prior as the postulated model and
to the true densities {fY|M=m(·)} and the true prior {πm} as the true model. We
emphasize that the postulated model need not be consistent with the mathematical
assumptions we made in deriving the true model, and it may not resemble the
truth. But we hope that if it does, then using the MAP rule corresponding to the
postulated model may yield good results on the true model.
Instead of providing the densities explicitly, we sometimes describe them by how
the observables are generated. For example, instead of saying that we pretend that
“under H = 0 the observable is N(A, σ2) and that under H = 1 it is N(−A, σ2),”
we could say that we pretend that “the observable Y is given by Y = (1−2H)A+Z,
where Z ∼N(0, σ2) is independent of H.”
For the ISI channel we shall postulate a model that is also an ISI channel, but
one whose ISI coeﬃcients

ℏκ

are simpler in the sense that ℏκ is zero for every
integer κ that is either negative or exceeds some κmax ∈N:
ℏκ = 0,
κ /∈{0, . . . , κmax}.
(32.27)
The ISI coeﬃcients (hκ) of the true model, which are given in (32.20), do not
typically have this simple form. However, as we next show, if κmax is allowed to
be suﬃciently large, then a judicious choice of the phase of the whitening ﬁlter
can lead to the true coeﬃcients being “nearly” of this simple form: hκ will be
approximately zero whenever κ is negative or exceeds κmax.
To this end, we ﬁrst note that the sequence (hκ) of ISI coeﬃcients corresponding
to any whitening ﬁlter hDT-Wh is absolutely summable (32.21), so it tends to
zero as κ tends to ±∞. Consequently, hκ is approximately zero whenever κ /∈
{κ1, . . . , κ2}, where κ1, κ2 are appropriately chosen integers. If κ1 is zero, we set
κmax to be κ2 and we are done. Otherwise, we change our whitening ﬁlter so that
the new ISI coeﬃcients be equal to the result of shifting (hκ) by κ1. To be more
explicit, if hDT-Wh is the original whitening ﬁlter that yielded (hκ), we consider
the new whitening ﬁlter ν 	→hDT-Wh
ν+κ1
. (This is also a whitening ﬁlter because the
Discrete-Time Fourier Transform of ν 	→hDT-Wh
ν+κ1
has the same magnitude as that
of hDT-Wh.) Substituting ν 	→hDT-Wh
ν+κ1
for hDT-Wh in (32.20) shows that employing
ν 	→hDT-Wh
ν+κ1
instead of hDT-Wh yields the ISI coeﬃcients κ 	→hκ+κ1, which are
approximately zero whenever κ is negative or exceeds κmax, where κmax = κ2 −κ1.

32.3 Guessing the Data Bits
809
To complete the description of the postulated model we need to address the prior.
Recall that X = ϕ(D), where ϕ: {0, 1}k →Rn is a one-to-one mapping that maps
the k data bits to the n real symbols; see (28.3), (28.4), and (28.5). Let X denote
the constellation of ϕ (Section 10.8), so ϕ(D) ∈X n. For the purpose of deriving
our decision rule, we shall postulate that
D1, . . . , Dk ∼IID random bits
(32.28a)
and that the system is uncoded (Section 10.9), i.e., that the range of ϕ is X n

ϕ(d) : d ∈{0, 1}k
= X n.
(32.28b)
Since we are assuming throughout that ϕ is one-to-one, postulating that it is also
onto is equivalent to postulating that it is a one-to-one mapping of {0, 1}k onto X n
(Section 10.9). Such a mapping maps uniform inputs to uniform outputs. And
since (32.28a) is equivalent to (D1, . . . , Dk) being uniform over {0, 1}k, we can
conclude that (32.28) (together with the assumption that ϕ is one-to-one) implies
that
(X1, . . . , Xn) ∼U (X n) ,
(32.29)
i.e., that the symbols X1, . . . , Xn are independent with each being uniformly dis-
tributed over X:
X1, . . . , Xn ∼IID U (X).
(32.30)
(In fact, since ϕ is one-to-one, the conditions (32.30), (32.29), and (32.28) are
equivalent.)
32.3.2
States and Dynamic Programming
We next derive a guessing rule for the postulated model. We pretend that our
observations came from this model, and we ﬁnd the guessing rule that minimizes
the probability of a message error (28.16).
We begin by noting that, since the postulated ISI coeﬃcients (ℏν) satisfy (32.27),
the outputs . . . , Y−1, Y0 and the outputs Yn+κmax+1, . . . are not inﬂuenced by the
symbols (X1, . . . , Xn), and they are merely independent noise. Under the postu-
lated model we can therefore ignore these outputs and base our guess of D only on
the observed y1, . . . , yn+κmax. For typographical reasons, it is convenient to deﬁne
n′ = n + κmax.
(32.31)
Since X is a deterministic function of the data D,
˜fY1,...,Yn′|D=d(y1, . . . , yn′) = ˜fY1,...,Yn′|X=ϕ(d)(y1, . . . , yn′).
Hence, given y1, . . . , yn′, the Maximum-Likelihood decoder for the postulated model
searches over all d ∈{0, 1}k for the data vector that maximizes the value of
˜fY1,...,Yn′|X=ϕ(d)(y1, . . . , yn′). Since the range of ϕ is X n (32.28b), we can per-
form this search in two steps: ﬁrst search over all sequences in X n for some ˜x for
which
˜fY1,...,Yn′|X=˜x(y1, . . . , yn′) = max
x′∈X n ˜fY1,...,Yn′|X=x′(y1, . . . , yn′)

(resolving ties arbitrarily), and then produce the data sequence ϕ−1(˜x) that ϕ
maps to it.
To ﬁnd a maximizer ˜x, we need the postulated densities in an explicit form. Sub-
stituting in (32.22) the postulated ISI coeﬃcients (ℏν) for the true ones (hν) and
recalling that the Zℓ’s are IID N(0, 1), we obtain the explicit form

with xℓtaken as zero if ℓ/∈{1, . . . n}.
(32.33)
Taking logarithms, discarding the term −n′
2 log(2π) (which is common to all the
hypotheses), and scaling by −2α−2, we conclude that the maximization of the
likelihood under the postulated model is equivalent to the minimization of Υ(x; y),
where x and y stand for x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn′, and

with xℓtaken as zero if ℓ/∈{1, . . . n}. We refer to Υ(x; y) as the “cost of x1, . . . , xn.”
(More precise but too cumbersome would have been “cost of x1, . . . , xn given
y1, . . . , yn′.”)
The diﬃculty in minimizing the cost Υ(x; y) over x1, . . . , xn is that each symbol xℓ
inﬂuences a number of diﬀerent terms in the sum, so we cannot minimize the sum
term-by-term. To address this issue, we introduce the notion of a state. We will
deﬁne the states so that the time-ℓstate sℓwill be a deterministic function of the
time-(ℓ−1) state sℓ−1 and the symbol xℓ
sℓ= ψ(sℓ−1, xℓ)
(32.35a)
(where the time-zero state s0 is chosen arbitrarily) and so that the cost Υ(x; y)
will be expressible as
Υ(x; y) =
n

ℓ=1
γℓ(xℓ, sℓ−1; yℓ) + γn+1(sn; yn+1, . . . , yn′)
(32.35b)
for some functions γ1, . . . , γn+1. Once we have cast the problem in this form, we
will be able to use Dynamic Programming or the Viterbi Algorithm to minimize
the cost.
Ideally, we would like the time-(ℓ−1) state sℓ−1 to correspond to the symbols
xℓ−1, . . . , xℓ−κmax, which are needed in addition to xℓin order to compute the ℓ-th
term in (32.34) (for 1 ≤ℓ≤n). This would allow us to express this term as a
function of xℓand sℓ−1 (and yℓ). But there are some slight technicalities stemming
from edge eﬀects. We must therefore be a bit more formal.
A state s is a κmax-tuple in X κmax of components s(1), s(2), . . . , s(κmax):

The collection of all states, namely X κmax, is denoted S:
S = X κmax.
(32.37)
We choose from S some arbitrary state s0 ∈S and call it “the state at time zero.”
We next deﬁne the state transition law. As in a shift-register, feeding the symbol x1
at time 1 results in the transition of the state from s0 to the time-1 state
s1 =

We express this by writing

Thus,

In general, if the time-(ℓ−1) state is sℓ−1, then feeding xℓleads to the time-ℓstate

where
ψ(sℓ−1, xℓ) =

(The second case accounts for the edge eﬀect we mentioned earlier.) From sℓwe

Having established that our problem of minimizing (32.34) can be cast as in (32.35),
we next propose an algorithm to solve it. For typographical reasons we shall no
longer make the dependence of the cost on y1, . . . , yn′ explicit as in (32.35b), and
we shall write the cost instead as
n

ℓ=1
γℓ(xℓ, sℓ−1) + γn+1(sn).
Let us deﬁne the cost-to-go of xj, . . . , xn from the state s at time j −1 as
n

ℓ=j
γℓ(xℓ, sℓ−1) + γn+1(sn),
(32.52)
where the state evolves according to (32.40a) with sj−1 taken to be s. Let us denote
by cj−1(s) the minimum of (32.52) over all choices of xj, xj+1, . . . , xn. We refer to
cj−1(s) as the minimum cost-to-go from s at time j −1. With this notation the
minimum of (32.35b) that we seek can be expressed as c0(s0)
min
x∈X n Υ(x; y) = c0(s0).
(32.53)
Moreover,
cn(s) = γn+1(s),
s ∈S.
(32.54)
To be formal, we say that cn(s) is achieved by the empty string of symbols.
To get a sense of what the next proposition is about, let us imagine that we did not
know that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. Even without
knowing this, it would be fairly easy to convince ourselves that if the shortest
path from A to B goes through C, then its segment from C to B ought to be along
the shortest path from C to B. This is the analog of the following proposition,
which can also be stated extremely informally as follows: “Whether or not a path
achieving cν(˜s) goes at time j through the state s we do not know. But if it does,
then it must continue from there along a path that achieves cj(s), and any path
achieving cj(s) will do.”
Proposition 32.3.1 (Principle of Optimality: Cost-to-Go). Let s,˜s ∈S be ar-
bitrary states, and let ν, j ∈{0, . . . , n} be intermediate times with ν < j.

Proof. Let x⋆

the cost-to-go of xν+1, . . . , xn and the cost-to-go of xν+1, . . . , xj, x⋆

as follows:

(32.58)
Our assumption that xν+1, . . . , xn minimizes the cost-to-go from ˜s at time ν rules
out the possibility that xν+1, . . . , xj−1, x⋆
j, . . . , x⋆
n has a lower cost, and (32.56)
must hence hold with equality, thus proving that xj+1, . . . , xn must achieve cj(s)
and hence establishing Part (i). Moreover, the fact that (32.56) holds with equality
implies that the cost-to-go of xν+1, . . . , xj, x⋆
j+1, . . . , x⋆
n from ˜s at time ν is the same
as that of xν+1, . . . , xn, so it too achieves cν(˜s), thus establishing Part (ii).
We have already seen in (32.54) how to compute cn(s) for every state s ∈S. We
will now use Proposition 32.3.1 to show that knowing cj(s) for every state s ∈S
allows us to compute cj−1(˜s) eﬃciently for every state ˜s ∈S. This will allow us to
compute c0(s0) as follows: start by computing cn(s) for every state s ∈S; proceed
to compute cn−1(s) for every state s ∈S; and continue in this fashion until you
have computed c0(s0). We will also see that with little additional work we can also
ﬁnd inputs x1, . . . , xn that achieve c0(s0).
Assume then that we have computed cj(s) for every state s ∈S, and ﬁx some
state ˜s for which we would like to compute cj−1(˜s).
Here j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
To
compute cj−1(˜s) we need to ﬁnd some sequence x′
j, . . . , x′
n that achieves it. There
are # X n−j+1 such sequences, but our search turns out to be easier: once we have
found x′
j, the rest is easy, and there are only # X possible choices for x′
j. To see
why x′
j holds the key, suppose that x′
j, . . . , x′
n achieves cj−1(˜s). Since

we can infer from Proposition 32.3.1 (with the substitution of j −1 for ν and of
ψ(˜s, x′

j+1, . . . , x′
n must achieve cj

(32.59)
As promised, the minimization in (32.59) is over x in X, and the latter contains
only # X elements.
The algorithm for ﬁnding c0(s0) can be thus described as
follows: For each s ∈S compute cn(s). Then use (32.59) to compute cn−1(˜s) for
every ˜s ∈S. Continue using (32.59) until you have computed c0(s0). (In the last
step one need not compute c0(s) for every state: it suﬃces to compute c0(s0).)
To guess the symbols, we also need to ﬁnd a sequence achieving c0(s0) and not
just the latter’s value. This requires just a simple change to our algorithm. Again
we start out with the calculation of cn(s) for every s ∈S. But we also keep track
of the sequence that achieves it: in this case the empty sequence. Suppose now
that we have computed cj

s

for every s ∈S and that we have found a sequence
x⋆
j+1, . . . , x⋆
n that achieves it. For each ˜s ∈S we next calculate cj−1(˜s) according
to (32.59). If the minimum in (32.59) is achieved by some x⋆, then we record that
cj−1(˜s) is achieved by the concatenation of x⋆with the sequence that achieves
cj

ψ(˜s, x⋆)

.
We continue until we have computed c0(s0) and a sequence that
achieves it.
The complexity of this procedure is roughly proportional to n (# S) (# X), i.e., to
n (# X)κmax+1,
(32.60)
because in going from j to j −1 we use (32.59) for every ˜s ∈S, and in each use we
search over a set of cardinality # X.
This algorithm is not very suitable for real-time applications, because it is a “back-
ward algorithm” that can only begin once all the symbols y1, . . . , yn′ have been
received. Instead, engineers usually implement the Viterbi Algorithm, which is a
“forward algorithm,” that we describe next. It is very similar to the algorithm we
described above, except that, instead of working down from n, it works up to n.
32.3.3
The Viterbi Algorithm
Instead of studying the cost-to-go, we shall study the cost-to-reach, which we
deﬁne next. The cost-to-reach of x1, . . . , xj (from s0) is
j

ℓ=1
γℓ(xℓ, sℓ−1) + γn+1(sn) I{j = n},
(32.61)
where the state evolves according to (32.40a), and the last term γn+1(sn) is added
only if j is equal to n. Let us denote by ˜cj(s) the minimum cost-to-reach over
all sequences x1, . . . , xj reaching s at time j, i.e., satisfying s0
x1

such sequence exists, then we say that s cannot be reached from s0 in j steps, and

we set ˜cj(s) to be +∞. For j = 0 we deﬁne
˜c0(s) =

0
if s = s0,
+∞
otherwise,
(32.62)
and we say that ˜c0(s0) is achieved by the empty string of inputs.
In terms of the minimal cost-to-reach, the minimum of (32.35b) that we seek is
min
x∈X n Υ(x; y) = min
s∈S ˜cn(s),
(32.63)
and our task is to ﬁnd this minimum and a sequence x1, . . . , xn that achieves it.
The following proposition is the analog of Proposition 32.3.1 for the cost-to-reach.
Informally, it can be stated as follows: “Whether or not a path achieving ˜cν(˜s)
goes at time j < ν through the state s we do not know. But if it does, then it does
so along a path that achieves ˜cj(s), and any path achieving ˜cj(s) will do.” The
formal version is as follows:
Proposition 32.3.2 (Principle of Optimality: Cost-to-Reach). Let s,˜s ∈S be
arbitrary states, and let ν, j ∈{0, . . . , n} be intermediate times with j < ν. Let
x1, . . . , xν achieve ˜cν(˜s) and go through the state s at time j

Then:

(ii) If x⋆
1, . . . , x⋆
j achieves ˜cj(s), then x⋆
1, . . . , x⋆
j, xj+1, . . . , xν achieves ˜cν(˜s).
Proof. Let x⋆
1, . . . , x⋆
j achieve ˜cj(s).
The proof is very similar to the proof of
Proposition 32.3.1 and compares the cost-to-reach of x1, . . . , xν with the cost-to-
reach of x⋆
1, . . . , x⋆
j, xj+1, . . . , xν. The details are omitted.
With the aid of Proposition 32.3.2 (with the substitution of j + 1 for ν) we shall
next show how knowing ˜cj(s) for every state s ∈S allows us to compute ˜cj+1(˜s)
eﬃciently. We ﬁrst show that
˜cj+1(˜s) =

We do not know s′, but we do know from (32.66) that
s′ x′
j+1
⇝˜s.
(32.67)
Since the inputs x′
1, . . . , x′
j+1 achieve ˜cj+1(˜s) and go through s′ at time j, it follows
from Proposition 32.3.2 (i) that the cost-to-reach of x′
1, . . . , x′
j is ˜cj(s′). Conse-
quently, ˜cj+1(˜s), which is the cost-to-reach of x′
1, . . . , x′
j+1, can also be expressed
as
˜cj+1(˜s) = ˜cj(s′) + γj+1(x′
j+1, s′) + γn+1(˜s) I{j + 1 = n}.
(32.68)
By (32.67), the pair s′, x′
j+1 are in the feasible set of (32.65), and we thus conclude
that ˜cj+1(˜s) is lower-bounded by the RHS of (32.65). (The RHS of (32.65), which
is the minimum over all choices of s and x satisfying s
x⇝˜s cannot be higher than
when we make a particular choice for s to be s′ and of x to be x′
j+1.) However,
equality must hold, because if s⋆and x⋆achieve the minimum in (32.65), and if
x⋆
1, . . . , x⋆
j achieve ˜cj(s⋆), then the concatenated sequence x⋆


s⋆
+ γj+1(x⋆, s⋆) + γn+1(˜s) I{j + 1 = n},
which is the RHS of (32.65).
The minimization in (32.65) is over all states s and symbols x satisfying s
x⇝˜s.
Given some state ˜s ∈S, under what conditions on x ∈X and s ∈S does this hold?
In other words, given ˜s ∈S, from which states s and with which inputs x can we
go from s to ˜s? Using (32.40b) it is readily seen that s
x⇝˜s holds if, and only if,
the following two conditions hold:
1) The state s has the form
s =

˜s(2), ˜s(3), . . . ˜s(κmax−1), ξ

(32.69a)
for some ξ ∈X.
2) The input x is given by
x = ˜s(1).
(32.69b)
Here ξ can be viewed as the right-most entry in the shift register s, i.e., as the
entry that is “forgotten” as x enters the shift-register from the left.
Thus, in the minimization on the RHS of (32.65) we can ﬁx x to be ˜s(1), and we
can restrict the minimization over s to states s that are of the form (32.69a), of
which there are only # X.
We can thus describe the Viterbi Algorithm as follows: Initialize using (32.62).
Assume now that you have computed ˜cj(s) for every state s ∈S. Compute ˜cj+1(˜s)
for every ˜s ∈S as follows: for each ξ ∈X compute
˜cj(s) + γj+1(x, s) + γn+1(˜s) I{j + 1 = n},
where x and s are given in (32.69), and ﬁnd one, say ξ⋆, that among all those ξ’s
minimizes this expression. If s⋆is the result of substituting ξ⋆for ξ in (32.69a),
then
˜cj+1(˜s) = ˜cj(s⋆) + γj+1

Continue until ˜cn(s) has been computed for every state s and then take its minimum
over all s. This is the minimum of (32.35b).
A minor alteration to the algorithm allows us to ﬁnd not only the minimum of ˜cn(s)
but also a path that achieves it. The idea is to compute not only ˜cj(s) but also
a path that achieves it. Such a path is called a survivor for the state s at
time j. The survivor for the state s0 at time 0 is the empty path. Suppose now
that for some j ∈{0, . . . , n −1} we have found both ˜cj(s) and a survivor achieving
it for every s ∈S. To compute ˜cj+1(˜s) we use (32.65). If the minimum in (32.65)
is achieved by s⋆and x⋆(with the latter being equal to ˜s(1) by (32.69b)), then a
survivor for the state ˜s at time j + 1 is the concatenation of the survivor for the
state s⋆at time j and the symbol x⋆.
At the heart of the Viterbi Algorithm is (32.65), which engineers sometimes call
the add-compare-select step: For each choice of s and x satisfying s
x⇝˜s, we
add to ˜cj

s

the term γj+1(x, s) + γn+1(˜s) I{j + 1 = n} and we compare the
results. We then select the pair s⋆and x⋆for which the result is minimal. We
ﬁnally set ˜cj+1(˜s) to be this minimum, and we set the survivor of ˜cj+1(˜s) to be the
concatenation of the survivor of ˜cj

s⋆
with x⋆.
We have chosen to derive the Viterbi Algorithm via Dynamic Programming. A
diﬀerent approach is graph theoretic. We imagine a directed graph with weights
whose vertices are pairs of times and states (j, s). More speciﬁcally, it has the
vertex (0, s0) and all the vertices of the form (j, s) where j ∈{1, . . . , n} and s ∈S.
There is an edge from the vertex (j, s) to the vertex (j + 1,˜s) if s
x⇝˜s, in which
case its weight is
γj+1(x, s) + γn+1(˜s) I{j + 1 = n},
(32.71)
i.e.,
γj+1

˜s(1), s

+ γn+1(˜s) I{j + 1 = n}.
(32.72)
Note that the graph contains no cycles. In this setting the Viterbi Algorithm ﬁnds
the path of least weight from s0 to each of the vertices that has the form (n, s)
for some s ∈S (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, 2009, Section 24.2). The
graph, without the weights, is sometimes called a trellis. An example of a trellis
is depicted in Figure 32.2. (Only the vertices (j, s) that are reachable from (0, s0)
are depicted.)
Our description of the Viterbi Algorithm has us decode only after n steps. Since n
is typically very large (corresponding to the total number of symbols transmitted
during the transmitter’s lifetime), this delay is intolerable. Instead engineers often
decode Xℓafter running the Viterbi Algorithm for ℓ+ j steps, where j is chosen to
be “suﬃciently large.” They pick some arbitrary state s and look at its time-(ℓ+j)
survivor. This survivor’s time-ℓsymbol is then their guess of Xℓ.

QAM on the ISI Channel
We next consider QAM for the ISI channel. As in Section 28.5, we envision that k
data bits D1, . . . , Dk, which we stack in a vector D, are mapped by ϕ: {0, 1}k →Cn
to n complex symbols C1, . . . , Cn, which we stack in a vector C, so ϕ(D) = C.

We can hence view the received waveform as the sum of a QAM signal (of pulse

also identiﬁed a real random vector (Section 28.5.2) and a complex random vector

The similarities between the discrete-time model for PAM (32.22) and for QAM
(32.86) are striking. The only diﬀerence is that in the former the symbols (Xℓ)
and ISI coeﬃcients (hκ) are real, whereas in the latter the symbols (Cℓ) and ISI
coeﬃcients (hκ) are complex, and that the Gaussians in the former are real and in
the latter complex.
As we did in the real case, we shall now assume that the data D1, . . . , Dk are IID
random bits and that transmission is uncoded, so
(C1, . . . , Cn) ∼U (Cn) ,
(32.87)

Under the postulated model the outputs Yj for j < 0 or j > n + κmax can thus
be ignored, and the decision can be based on Y1, . . . , Yn′, where n′ = n + κmax.
Since the Gaussians in (32.86c) are standard complex Gaussians (Section 24.2.1),

Taking logarithms, discarding the term −n′ log π (which is common to all the
hypotheses), and scaling by −α−2, we conclude that the maximization of the like-
lihood under the postulated model is equivalent to the minimization of Υ(c; y),
where c and y stand for c1, . . . , cn and y1, . . . , yn′, and

with cℓtaken as zero if ℓ/∈{1, . . . n}. We refer to this quantity as the “cost of
c1, . . . , cn.” Notice that Υ(c; y) is very similar to its PAM counterpart (32.34):
the only diﬀerence is that the symbols are denoted cℓinstead of xℓand that the
squared parentheses are replaced with the squared magnitude.
As for PAM, we next deﬁne states so that the time-ℓstate sℓwill be a deterministic
function of the time-(ℓ−1) state sℓ−1 and the symbol cℓ
sℓ= ψ(sℓ−1, cℓ)
(32.91a)
(where the time-zero state s0 is chosen arbitrarily); and so that the cost (32.90)
will be expressible as
Υ(c; y) =
n

ℓ=1
γℓ(cℓ, sℓ−1; yℓ) + γn+1(sn; yn+1, . . . , yn′).
(32.91b)
Once we have cast the problem in this form, we will be able to use Dynamic
Programming or the Viterbi Algorithm to minimize the cost just as we did for
PAM.
The states are now elements of Cκmax (instead of elements of X κmax in the PAM
case), and the transition law analogous to (32.40) is
sℓ= ψ(sℓ−1, cℓ),

32.5 From Passband to Baseband
823
With these new deﬁnitions, the Dynamic Programming algorithm and the Viterbi
Algorithm require no change.
32.5
From Passband to Baseband
The QAM receiver that we described in Section 32.4 is mathematically elegant but
not very practical. The diﬃculty is in computing T (ℓ)
I
and T (ℓ)
Q , which are needed to
calculate Tℓ(32.80). In principle, we could compute them using matched ﬁlters, but
the impulse responses of these ﬁlters would depend on the carrier frequency. For
this frequency to be tunable, we would need a whole set of matched ﬁlters for all the
diﬀerent carrier frequencies, and this would have dire implications on the required
hardware. Also, designing such ﬁlters can be very tricky when fc is large. Instead,
engineers prefer to convert the received waveform to baseband (Section 7.6) or to
some intermediate frequency, and to then perform the required signal processing
on the converted signal, which does not depend on the carrier frequency.2 There
are numerous diﬀerent designs along these lines, and we cannot possibly analyze
them all. Instead, we shall focus on one and present the mathematical tools that
are needed to analyze it and many of its ilk.

Figure 32.3: Converting the received signal to baseband. The diagram uses com-
plex notation; if h is real (which it usually is), then a real implementation would
be reminiscent of Figure 7.11.
Our design is depicted with complex notation in Figure 32.3. The received signal
is denoted Yc and is assumed to be the sum of a mean signal sc and centered
noise Nc.
For the ISI channel the mean signal is xc ⋆hc, but for the sake of
generality we prefer to denote it sc.
We shall assume that sc is an integrable
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc. The received
signal Yc is fed to a stable real nonideal bandpass ﬁlter of impulse response hFE.
This ﬁlter serves two purposes. The ﬁrst is to serve as a front-end ﬁlter of the
kind we discussed in Section 26.7 and brieﬂy in Section 26.8. For this purpose it
2Applying the results of Chapter 7 directly is, however, mathematically dubious, because the
noise component of the received signal is neither energy-limited nor integrable. Nevertheless, the
results of Chapter 7 do provide the right intuition; see Appendix D.

is typically required to satisfy
ˆhFE(f) = 1,
|f| −fc
 ≤W
2
(32.97)
so as to pass the mean signal sc unaltered; cf. (26.60). The second is to convert the
received waveform Yc into a (random) passband signal that can be then converted
to baseband. For this purpose we typically require that
ˆhFE(f) = 0,
|f| −fc
 > WFE
2
(32.98a)
for some
0 < WFE
2
< fc.
(32.98b)
The front-end ﬁlter does depend on the carrier frequency, but only very coarsely.
And it is typically not required to reject all the out-of-band noise, so its impulse
response need not be very precise.
The output Yc ⋆hFE of the front-end ﬁlter is next converted to baseband using
the following procedure: it is multiplied by t 	→e−i2πfct, and the result is then fed
to a stable ﬁlter—possibly-complex, but usually real— of impulse response h. We
denote the CSP that the procedure produces ˜Yc so
˜Yc =

t 	→e−i2πfct(Yc ⋆hFE)(t)

⋆h.
(32.99)
This is reminiscent of the procedure described in Proposition 7.6.3 with ˇg0 replaced
by h. (In practice, engineers often choose h to be the impulse response of a stable
ﬁlter that closely resembles an ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter of cutoﬀfrequency
W/2. The ideal unit-gain lowpass ﬁlter itself is, alas, not stable.) For the ﬁlter to
“reject the image,” we shall assume that
ˆh(f) = 0,
|f| > WBB,
(32.100a)
where WBB, in analogy to (7.35b), satisﬁes
0 < WBB ≤2fc −WFE
2
.
(32.100b)
And for the procedure to produce the baseband representation of sc in the absence
of noise, we require that
ˆh(f) = 1,
|f| ≤W
2 .
(32.101)
Our main result is that from the baseband ﬁlter’s output ˜Yc we can recover Tℓusing
a (complex) matched ﬁlter. More precisely, if the front-end ﬁlter satisﬁes (32.97)
and the baseband lowpass ﬁlter satisﬁes (32.101), then

32.5.1
Computing Inner Products in Baseband
To derive (32.102) we shall begin by showing that—as long as the front-end ﬁlter
is of unit gain over the frequency band of interest (32.97)— we can compute the
passband inner products T (ℓ)
I
and T (ℓ)
Q
of (32.80) from Yc ⋆hFE.
Proposition 32.5.1 (

Y, gPB

and

Y ⋆hFE, gPB

). Let gPB be a real integrable
signal that is bandlimited to W Hz around the carrier frequency fc, and let hFE be
the real impulse response of a stable ﬁlter satisfying (32.97). If Y is a SP satisfying
sup

(32.103)
then

Y, gPB

Y ⋆hFE, gPB

with probability 1.
(32.104)
Proof. Using Lemma 15.7.1 on the associativity of the convolution with the sub-
stitution of hFE for r; of Y for

X(t)

; of ~gPB for h; and of 0 for t, we obtain that

and

(−σ)~gPB(σ) dσ
(32.105)
are both deﬁned and are equal. The integral on the right in (32.105) is the inner
product on the right in (32.104). And since the front-end ﬁlter has unit gain over
the bandwidth of interest (32.97), hFE ⋆~gPB equals ~gPB, and the integral on the
left in (32.105) is the inner product on the left in (32.104).
Applying Proposition 32.5.1 twice—once by substituting pc,I,ℓfor gPB and once
by substituting pc,Q,ℓfor gPB—we obtain that, with probability one, T (ℓ)

This expression for Tℓis the one we promised in (32.102).
We state this as a
theorem:
Theorem 32.5.3. Let pc be some integrable complex signal that is bandlimited to
W/2 Hz, and let the passband signals pc,I,ℓand pc,Q,ℓbe given in (32.79). Let Yc
be some SP satisfying

and let ˜Yc be given by (32.99), where hFE ∈L1 is real and satisﬁes (32.97) and
h ∈L1 is possibly complex and satisﬁes (32.101). Then Tℓof (32.80) is given
by (32.102).
In some applications the baseband signal ˜Yc is used not only to compute inner
products but also for timing recovery or for estimating other parameters. For such
applications it is important to characterize the distribution of the baseband noise.
This is explored in Appendix D.

Additional Reading
The literature on communication over linearly-dispersive channels is vast. Good
starting points are (Proakis and Salehi, 2007) and (Barry, Lee, and Messerschmitt,
2004). These texts deal inter alia with suboptimal receiver designs for scenarios
where κmax is too large for the implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm. They
also deal with additional properties of the whitening ﬁlter (such as minimum-
phase) that are sometimes desirable. But please note that some of the results in
the literature do not guarantee the existence of a stable ﬁlter with these additional
properties but only one whose impulse response is square summable.
For more on Dynamic Programming, see (Bertsekas, 2005) and (Cormen, Leiserson,
Rivest, and Stein, 2009).

On the Fourier Series
A.1
Introduction and Preliminaries
We survey here some of the results on the Fourier Series that are used in the book.
The Fourier Series has numerous other applications that we do not touch upon.
For those we refer the reader to (Katznelson, 2004), (Dym and McKean, 1972),
and (K¨orner, 1988).
To simplify typography, we denote the half-open interval [−1/2, 1/2) by I:

Deﬁnition A.1.1 (Fourier Series Coeﬃcient). The η-th Fourier Series Coef-
ﬁcient of an integrable function g: I →C is denoted by ˆg(η) and is deﬁned for
every integer η by
ˆg(η) ≜

I
g(θ) e−i2πηθ dθ.
(A.2)
The periodic extension of the function g: I →C is denoted by gP : R →C and
is deﬁned as
gP(n + θ) = g(θ),

n ∈Z, θ ∈I

.
(A.3)
We say that g: I →C is periodically continuous if its periodic extension gP is
continuous, i.e., if g(·) is continuous in I and if, additionally,
lim
θ↑1/2 g(θ) = g(−1/2).

A degree-n trigonometric polynomial is a function of the form

Finally, for every function h: I →C and ϑ ∈R we deﬁne the mapping hϑ : R →C

θ ∈R, then

(A.16)
Proof. This is easy to see if g is continuous, because in this case it is also uniformly
continuous (due to its periodicity). The general result follows from this case by
picking a periodic continuous function h that approximates g in the sense that
∥g −h∥I,1 < ϵ/2; by computing
∥g −gϑ∥I,1 = ∥g −h + h −gϑ∥I,1
= ∥g −h + h −hϑ + hϑ −gϑ∥I,1
≤∥g −h∥I,1 + ∥h −hϑ∥I,1 + ∥hϑ −gϑ∥I,1
= ∥g −h∥I,1 + ∥h −hϑ∥I,1 + ∥h −g∥I,1
≤ϵ + ∥h −hϑ∥I,1 ;
(A.17)
and by then applying the result to h, which is continuous.

Inequality (A.23) establishes the theorem as follows. For every ϵ > 0 we can ﬁnd
by Lemma A.2.1 some δ > 0 such that
max
|ϑ|≤δ

I
gP(θ −ϑ) −gP(θ)
 dθ < ϵ,
(A.24)
and keeping this δ > 0 ﬁxed we have by (A.11c)
lim

δ<|ϑ|< 1

kn(ϑ) dϑ = 0.

It thus follows from (A.23), (A.24), and (A.25) that
lim
n→∞

I
g(θ) −σn(g, θ)
 dθ < ϵ,
(A.26)
from which the theorem follows because ϵ > 0 was arbitrary.
From Theorem A.2.2 we obtain:
Theorem A.2.3 (Uniqueness Theorem). Let g1, g2 : I →C be integrable. If
ˆg1(η) = ˆg2(η),
η ∈Z,
(A.27)
then g1 and g2 are equal except on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
Proof. Let g = g1 −g2. By (A.27)
ˆg(η) = 0,
η ∈Z,
(A.28)
and consequently, by (A.13), σn(g, θ) = 0 for every n ∈N and θ ∈I. By Theo-

lim


I
g(θ) −σn(g, θ)
 dθ = 0,
(A.29)
which combines with (A.28) to establish that

I
|g(θ)| dθ = 0.
Thus, g is zero except on a set of Lebesgue measure zero (Proposition 2.5.3 (i)),
and the result follows by recalling that g = g1 −g2.

A.3
Geometric Considerations
Every square-integrable function that is zero outside the interval [−1/2, 1/2] is also
integrable (Proposition 3.4.3). For such functions we can discuss the inner product
and some of the related geometry. The main result is the following.
Theorem A.3.1 (Complete Orthonormal System). The bi-inﬁnite sequence of
functions . . . , φ−1, φ0, φ1, . . . deﬁned for every η ∈Z by
φη(θ) = ei2πηθ I

θ ∈I

,
θ ∈R
forms a complete orthonormal system (CONS) for the subspace of L2 consisting of
those energy-limited functions that are zero outside the interval I.
Proof. The orthonormality follows by direct calculation

836
On the Fourier Series
To show completeness it suﬃces by Proposition 8.6.5 (ii) to show that a square-
integrable function g: I →C that satisﬁes
⟨g, φη⟩= 0,
η ∈Z
(A.34)
must be equal to the all-zero function except on a subset of I of Lebesgue measure
zero. To show this, we note that
⟨g, φη⟩= ˆg(η),
η ∈Z,
(A.35)
so (A.34) is equivalent to
ˆg(η) = 0,
η ∈Z,
(A.36)
and hence, by Theorem A.2.3, g must be zero except on a set of Lebesgue measure
zero.
Recalling Deﬁnition 8.2.1 and Proposition 8.2.2 (d) we obtain that, because the
functions . . . , φ−1, φ0, φ1, . . . form a CONS and because ⟨g, φη⟩= ˆg(η), the fol-
lowing holds:

Appendix B
On the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
The Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) is to absolutely summable bi-inﬁnite
sequences what the Fourier Transform is to integrable functions. Here we summa-
rize its basic properties.
Recall that a bi-inﬁnite sequence . . . , a−1, a0, a1, . . . is absolutely summable if
∞

ν=−∞
|aν| < ∞,
and that the set containing all such sequences is denoted ℓ1. Recall also that I
denotes the half-closed interval
I =

and that its closure ¯I is thus

Deﬁnition B.1 (The Discrete-Time Fourier Transform). The Discrete-Time
Fourier Transform (DTFT) of a complex absolutely summable bi-inﬁnite se-
quence (aν) is the mapping ua: R →C deﬁned by
ua: θ 	→
∞

ν=−∞
aν e−i2πνθ.
(B.1)
The key properties of the DTFT are summarized below.
Theorem B.2 (Properties of the DTFT). Let (aν) be a complex absolutely summable
bi-inﬁnite sequence.
(i) The sum in (B.1) converges uniformly on R.
(ii) The function ua(·) is continuous and periodic with
ua(θ + 1) = ua(θ),
θ ∈R.

Ő
a ⋆b(θ) = ua(θ) ub(θ),
θ ∈R.
(B.6)
Proof. Part (i) follows by observing that, since the complex exponentials are of
modulus one,
aν e−i2πνθ ≤|aν|,
θ ∈R
and, since the RHS of the above is summable, the uniform convergence of the sum
follows from Weierstrass’s test (Rudin, 1976, Ch. 7, Theorem 7.10).
As to Part (ii), the continuity of ua follows from the continuity of the complex
exponentials and from Part (i) as follows: the former implies that the partial sums
are continuous, the latter implies that they converge uniformly, and if a sequence
of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit must be a continuous
function (Rudin, 1976, Theorem 7.12). The periodicity follows from the periodicity
of the complex exponentials:
e−i2πν(θ+1) = e−i2πνθ,
(θ ∈R, ν ∈Z).

where the term-by-term integration is justiﬁed by the uniform convergence (Rudin,

We next turn to Part (iv). By Part (iii) we can express a−ν as the ν-th Fourier
Series Coeﬃcient of ua, i.e.,
a−ν = ˆua(ν),
ν ∈Z.
Likewise,
b−ν = ˆub(ν),

so Part (iv) follows from Theorem A.3.2.

Every absolutely summable sequence is square summable (31.1), but some se-
quences are square summable but not absolutely summable.1 The next theorem
allows us to deﬁne the discrete-time analog of the L2-Fourier Transform (Sec-
tion 6.2.3): it allows us to deﬁne the DTFT of any square-summable sequence,
even if is not absolutely summable.

On the Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
The function g is unique in the sense that two functions that satisfy (B.7)

Appendix C
Positive Deﬁnite Functions
Complex positive deﬁnite functions appear inter alia as the characteristic func-
tions of random variables (Sections 19.7.1 and 17.3.6) and as the autocovariance
functions of complex stochastic processes. Real positive deﬁnite functions appear
as the characteristic functions of symmetric RVs or as the autocovariance functions
of (real) SPs.
Deﬁnition C.1 (Positive Deﬁnite Function). A function h: R →C is said to be
positive deﬁnite if for every positive integer n and all choices of x1, . . . , xn ∈R
and α1, . . . , αn ∈C
n

j=1
n

k=1
αj α∗
k h(xj −xk) ≥0.
(C.1)
Allowing the coeﬃcients α1, . . . , αn in (C.1) to be complex is not very natural when
h(·) is real. The following proposition shows that if h(·) is real and symmetric, then
it suﬃces to establish (C.1) for real α’s.
Proposition C.2 (Real Positive Deﬁnite Functions). A real function h: R →R
is positive deﬁnite if, and only if, it satisﬁes the following two conditions: it is
symmetric (i.e., ~h = h) and (C.1) holds for all x1, . . . , xn ∈R and α1, . . . , αn ∈R.
The basic properties of positive deﬁnite functions are summarized below (Feller,
1971, Chapter XIX, Section 2, Lemma 3).
Proposition C.3 (Basic Properties). If h: R →C is positive deﬁnite, then
(i) it is conjugate symmetric
h(−x) = h∗(x),
x ∈R;
(ii) its value at zero h(0) is nonnegative (and hence real)
h(0) ≥0;
(iii) it attains its maximum at zero in the sense that
|h(x)| ≤h(0),
x ∈R;

h(0) −Re(h(x −y))

,
x, y ∈R.
Theorem C.4 (Bochner). If h: R →C is a continuous positive deﬁnite function,
then h is proportional to a characteristic function of some RV V in the sense that
h(x) = h(0) · E

ei2πxV 
,
x ∈R.
If additionally h is real-valued, then it can be expressed as above with the RV V
having a symmetric distribution.
Since the Inverse Fourier-Stieltjes Transform is injective (Rudin, 1962, Chapter 1,
Section 1.3, Theorem 1.3.6), Bochner’s Theorem has the following corollary.
Corollary C.5. If h: R →C is a positive deﬁnite function that is equal to the IFT
of some integrable function S: R →C, then S(·) must be nonnegative outside a set
of Lebesgue measure zero.
Theorem C.6 (Riesz-Crum).
(i) Every Lebesgue measurable positive deﬁnite function h: R →C can be ex-
pressed uniquely as
h(x) = hc(x) + hs(x),
x ∈R,
where hc(·) is a positive deﬁnite function that is continuous, and hs(·) is a
positive deﬁnite function that is zero outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero.
(ii) If h is real valued, then so are hc and hs; if h is integrable, then so is hc
(and hs); if h is symmetric (i.e., ~h = h) then so are hc and hs.
Proof. See Crum (1956).
If a nonzero positive deﬁnite function is continuous and also integrable, then it is
proportional to the characteristic function of a RV with a density, and the density
can be computed using the Fourier Transform (Feller, 1971, Chapter XV, Section 3,
Theorem 3, and Chapter XIX, Section 2, Lemma 1). Hence:
Proposition C.7 (Integrable Positive Deﬁnite Functions). A continuous integrable
positive deﬁnite function is equal to the IFT of its FT.
Dropping the continuity assumption yields a slightly weaker conclusion:

Positive Deﬁnite Functions
847
Corollary C.8. Let h: R →C be a positive deﬁnite integrable function, and let hc
and hs be as in Theorem C.6 (i).
(i) The IFT of the FT of h is equal to hc
ˇˆh = hc
(C.2)
and is thus indistinguishable from h
ˇˆh ≡h.
(C.3)
(ii) The FT of h is nonnegative
ˆh(f) ≥0,
f ∈R.
(C.4)
Proof. Since h = hc+hs and hs is zero outside a set of Lebesgue measure zero, the
functions h and hc are indistinguishable and thus of identical Fourier Transforms
ˆh = ˆhc.
(C.5)
To prove (C.2) we note that (C.5) implies that the IFT of the FT of h is equal to
the IFT of the FT of hc, and the latter is equal to hc by Proposition C.7.
From (C.5) we infer that to establish (C.4) it suﬃces to establish that
ˆhc(f) ≥0,
f ∈R.
(C.6)
This is trivial when hc is zero. When it is not, we can establish (C.6) by applying
Bochner’s Theorem to hc and by using the inversion formula for characteristic func-
tions (Shiryaev, 1996, Chapter II, § 12, Theorem 3) or (Feller, 1971, Chapter XV,
Section 3, Theorem 3).

Appendix D
The Baseband Representation of Passband
Stochastic Processes
Many of the results of Chapter 7 on the baseband representation of passband signals
also apply to stationary stochastic processes. But the proofs must be altered to
avoid applying the Fourier Transform to sample-paths, because those are typically
neither integrable nor of ﬁnite energy.
To state the results we need to extend the deﬁnition of a Gaussian CSP (Deﬁni-
tion 31.4.1) and of a proper CSP (Deﬁnition 17.5.4) from discrete time to contin-
uous time. The extensions are obvious but are provided nonetheless.
Deﬁnition D.1 (Gaussian, Proper, and Circularly-Symmetric CSP). A continuous-
time CSP

Z(t), t ∈R

is said to be Gaussian if every complex random vector
of the form

Z(t1), . . . Z(tn)
T,
where n ∈N and t1, . . . , tn ∈R, is a complex Gaussian vector (Deﬁnition 24.3.6).
It is said to be proper if every such complex random vector is proper (Deﬁni-
tion 17.4.1). And it is said to be circularly-symmetric if every such complex
random vector is circularly-symmetric (Deﬁnition 24.3.2).
Since a complex Gaussian vector is proper if, and only if, it is circularly-symmetric
(Proposition 24.3.11) we have:
Note D.2. A Gaussian CSP is proper if, and only if, it is circularly-symmetric.
We shall also need the deﬁnition of a WSS CSP in continuous time (the counterpart
to Deﬁnition 17.5.6).
Deﬁnition D.3 (WSS Continuous-Time CSP). A continuous-time CSP

Z(t)

is
said to be wide-sense stationary if it is of ﬁnite variance; the mean E[Z(t)] does
not depend on t; and Cov[Z(t + τ), Z(t)] does not depend on t. Its autocovariance
function KZZ is the mapping τ 	→Cov[Z(t + τ), Z(t)]. The CSP or the autocovari-
ance function is said to be of PSD SZZ if SZZ is nonnegative, integrable, and its
IFT is KZZ.
Using Proposition 24.3.7 we can mimick the proof of Proposition 25.5.1 to conclude:

Note D.4 (For Proper Gaussians, WSS = stationary). A proper Gaussian CSP
is wide-sense stationary if, and only if, it is stationary.
The ﬁrst result is on the synthesis of a passband SP from a baseband CSP. It is
particularly useful for computer simulations of passband systems.
Theorem D.5 (Synthesizing a Passband SP from a Baseband CSP). Let



(D.3)
(iii) If

XBB(t)

is Gaussian, then so is

X(t)

.
Proof. We begin by rewriting (D.1) in the form
X(t) = XBB(t) ei2πfct + X∗
BB(t) e−i2πfct,
t ∈R
(D.4)
to emphasize that X(t) is a linear functional of the pair XBB(t) and X∗
BB(t). We
now proceed to prove Part (i). Since

XBB(t)

is WSS, it is of ﬁnite variance and
therefore so is

X(t)

, because (D.1) implies that
X(t)
 ≤2
XBB(t) ei2πfct
and hence that
E

X2(t)

≤4 E

.
Since

XBB(t)

is proper, it is centered, and therefore so is

X(t)

(see (D.4)).
To complete the proof of Part (i) we next compute E[X(t + τ) X(t)].
We ﬁrst
substitute t + τ for t in (D.4), to obtain
X(t + τ) = XBB(t + τ) ei2πfc(t+τ) + X∗
BB(t + τ) e−i2πfc(t+τ).

where the second equality follows from the hypothesis that

To prove Part (ii) we note that since KBB is the IFT of SBB, the mapping in (D.2)

Proof. Let KPB be the autocovariance function of XPB. To establish that XBB is
proper and WSS, we need to show inter alia that it is of bounded variance. This
can be established using Fubini’s Theorem as in the proof of Proposition 25.10.1.
The details are therefore omitted.
In the course of the proof we shall repeatedly use the fact that the theorem’s

we have already established that XBB is centered, and since (D.26) holds for all

(D.31)
where the last equality follows from (D.8b). The RHS of (D.31) depends on t1 and
on t2 only via their diﬀerence t1 −t2, so XBB is WSS. From (D.31) we also see
that the autocovariance function of XBB is the IFT of the mapping in (D.10), so
the latter is the PSD of XBB.
To prove Part (ii) we shall establish (D.11), which implies that the power in XPB
is twice the power in XBB (Proposition 25.9.2 and its complex version). The LHS
of (D.11) is the integral of SPB over all the frequencies f ∈R. The RHS is twice
the integral of the mapping in (D.10) (because this mapping is by Part (i) the PSD
of XBB). The two are equal because XPB is real and its PSD is hence symmetric.
We next turn to Part (iii). For every epoch t ∈R we deﬁne the error

vBB is the baseband representation of vPB.
To establish Part (v) note that XPB is a Gaussian SP so

is a Gaussian CSP. Consequently, XBB, which is the result of ﬁltering this CSP, is
also a Gaussian CSP.1
We ﬁnally proceed to Part (vi). To establish independence and Gaussianity we need
to show that, for every n ∈N and epochs t1, . . . , tn ∈R, the random n-vectors

Moreover, to establish their independence it suﬃces to establish that they are
