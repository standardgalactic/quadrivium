SPEAKETH...

 n Sunday 27th August 1989 I was invited to participate in the computer industry
event of the year. Grandslam Entertainments had hired Luton Town's football
ground for the day, and ran a charity soccer tournament in aid of the Hillsborough
disaster fund and the baby care unit at Liverpool Maternity Hospital.
Needless to say that although the journalists came runners-up on the day, due to
a rather exciting penalty shoot-out, both Paul Kavanagh and myself thoroughly enjoyed
our day out and we look forward to competing next year. Apparently over 1:8,000 was
raised on the day and congratulations must go to Stephen Hall of Grandslam and everybody
else involved in the organisation for making it a successful venture.
This brings me nicely to the subject o f football related games. Although we shall
be exploring these in much greater detail in a later issue, I just ﬁnd i t quite startling
that this year so many !incensed soccer games are being released.
There's the Liverpool, Arsenal and Saint and Greavsie games from Grandslam Gazza's
Super Soccer from Empire: Manchester United from Krisalis; and Super League Boss
from Audiogenic (being programmed with advice from Lou Macari). As soon as \Tinny
Jones' boxing comes out my life will be complete.
Look after yourselves until next issue and don't let your shin-pads slip...

It's all systems Go for a trip
to Taiwan for Switzerland's
Anders Kierulf, the winner
of the ﬁrst Acer Computer
Olympiad which was held on
15 August at London's Park
Lane Hotel, All Kierulf had
to do to win was to program
the most challenging version
of the popular oriental game
of Go.
Each year Acer sponsors
the world's computer Go
championships in Taipei,
Taiwan and the Olympiad
was devised partly as a
qualiﬁer for this event. Con-
ceived and organised by
David Levy, an Interna-
tional Chess Master, the
Olympiad also invites entries
for other events such as
Chess, Scrabble and 10x10
draughts and this debut
attracted 85 programs from
17 countries.
In the Olympiad, pro-
grams compete against each
other in a  death or glory
battle to the death and the
medals are awarded to the
winners in each category. In
the I9x199 Go event the
competition was expected to
he stiff because the prize
means a trip to compete in
the world ﬁnal, the winner
of which can then try his
program against the skills of
a human expert. If the game
wins, t h e  programmer
stands to claim a El million
prize so Kierulf stands to
gain a  lot with his Swiss
Explorer program.
Any companies or bud-
ding whizz-kids who think
they can beat the world's
experts can get further

AZURE BONDS
Curse of the Azure Bonds continues
the series of games based on the
Advanced Dungeons and Dragons
role playing system and starts with
parties of 5th level and over.
SSI - PC E29.99, C64 Disk E24.99
URSE of the Azure
Bonds continues the
AD&D ta l e  t h a t
ended with a great victory
over the dark forces in the
city o f PhIan. Now with a
party of 5th and oth level
characters you thought you
were ready fo r anything.
Unfortunately you were
wrong, as you now ﬁnd you
party coming round in the
city of Tilverton and all is
far from well. All magic and
equipment is gone and now
you have ﬁve blue symbols
just under the skin of your
sword arm. These you will
soon learn are the handy
work of the ﬁve evil leaders
of the New Alliance. Each
one bonds you to do their
will upon call and your only
way out o f this curse is to
destroy the New Alliance.
Your party o f  brave
adventurers can include up
to six 5th level characters
and can be loaded in from
a Pool of Radiance of Hills-
far save disk, although you
may want to roll some new
ones as existing characters
could have race level restric-
tion: Or you may want to
try out a Paladin or Ranger
as these can now enter the
fray. Luckily your hijackers
have left the party with some
money to  purchase new
equipment but upon attack-
ing the king's carriage you
ﬁnd yourself thrown in jail
only to escape in the sewers
that have become the base
for the Fire Knives (a group
of thieves). Here you will
encounter your ﬁrst chal-
lenge as one of your bonds
matches their ﬂaming blade
symbol
The game system will be
familiar to those who have
played Pool o f  Radiance
(this game's prequel) and has
the same SD views, top down
combat screens, slow but
tactically accurate combat
system a n d  duckshoot
menus to control your char-
acters. However there have
been some additions t o
speed up gameplay. The ﬁrst
is the FIX option included
in the camp menu that is
used to take the pain out of
memorising and casting
"cure light wound" spells.
Select F I X  and it's done
automatically although i t
does take up game time. In
Pool you could spend ages
wandering around the wil-
derness, b u t now a  full
manual to try and ﬁnd the
best way to deal with crea-
tures such as elemantals,
salamanders and beholders,
as these are your new foes.
You may ﬁnd enemy clerics
and magic users to  be a
problem but wait until you

assume that almost every-
where is hostile and i f you
meet one of your "masters"
things can get tricky.
Curse o f  th e  Azure
Bonds also has a very dif-
ferent style of gameplay, as
due to your attack on the
king you don't have a ﬁxed
base to work on, so there's
no systematic clearing o f
areas. Instead you must
follow the trail of clues and
rumours to confront each of
your masters and their min-
ions in turn.
It may take time to adjust
to combat with 5th, oth, 7th
and 8th levels characters as
you have so many other
options to  think about -
such as which spells to use
and how and when to attack.
You'll also ﬁnd it useful i f
you had an AIMED monster

There are few differences
between the two versions of
the game except that PC
hard disk owners can do
away with all the disk swap-
ping associated with a game
with 8 disk sides.
Curse o f  th e  Azure
Bonds is the fourth game
based o n  Advanced Dun-
geons and Dragons that
began w i t h  P o o l  o f

that there are more to come.

The ultimate in gutter pres* has
started an intergalactic war with its
jingoistic outpourings. No y o u  have
to save the day.
Below: When you've killed the blob-like aliens...
P

•;,

T
haps the worst scene-
rio in the history of
computer games. It is both
unlikely and unrealistic and
shows no regard for the laws
of physics, logic or common
sense. Unfortunately, it's the
best part o f an otherwise
forgettable game.
The scenario centres
around an Earth newspaper
known as the SoonDay
Spirit (I wonder what that
could be?) and its silly stories
about aliens turning girl-
friends into potatoes and so
on. According to  Virgin
these headlines had upset the
aliens in question and when
the Soonday Spirit went too
far with the heading "Die
Mutant Alien Scum" the
entire forces of every planet
in the galaxy arrived to
destroy the Earth. But wait!
Is it a bird, is it a plane? No,
it's you. Armed with only a
single laser Gemini ﬁghter
you take o f f  to  destroy
everything else in the galaxy
to save the day and rack up
a high score. Oh yeah? You
have a  smuch chance o f
knitting fog or leading Eng-
land to  victory i n  a  Test
series.
This takes you to  the
game itself which would be
reasonable as a El.99 budget
release but not as a  full
priced game. It's yet another
shoot the aliens to collect
extra weapons style of game.
This apparently was caused
by a "strange paradox in the
fabric o f  reality" which
probably also explains how
Virgin can follow up a classic
like Silkworm with a game
like this.
Tony Hetherington
Back in the dawn o f com-
puter lime Virgin created a

All was quiet, all was still. Darkness
prevailed and neither good nor evil
was present; until the monitor probes
moved in to investigate an unknown
power source.
F

dank recesses o f an
underground complex on a
distant planet. There was no
light and n o  sound, and
nothing moved.
Nor h a d  a n y th i n g
thought of moving for quite
some time, but they were still
charged up and, high above
the planets surface, a probe
was watching, listening,
monitoring and unidentiﬁed
power source.
But the planet lay dor-
mant. Nothing moved upon
it's surface, no birds ﬂew and
no ﬁsh swam in the seas, and
yet, an electrical force was
being detected.
Relaying the data back
to base, the probe was
replaced b y a  transporter
ship which landed ﬁve
droids upon the surface.
They set about ﬁnding the
power and eventually traced
it to a subterranean city.
Going underground, the
proble begins transmitting
pictures of it's surroundings
and switches tomanual con-
trol for you to maneuver it
around the mazes of corri-
dors which have revealed
themselves.

onto your trail. Following
you they will launch projec-
tiles at your probe and can

However, the design o f
these mobile robots has one
major ﬂaw in i t they are
easily re-programmed using
a standard code. Utilising
this ﬂaw, your probe can
issue instructions to  the
robots which causes a
change o f heart and they
rebel against their creator
and protect you. Once rep-
rogramming is complete,
they will still follow but they
will get in your way and act
as a shield. However, squab-
bles still break out i f you
decide to  have more than
one born-again robot fol-
lowing i n  your footsteps.
Newcomers will run into the
back of those already estab-
lished and cause them to
explode.
There are various levels
to navigate and each one
contains a different breed of
robots. Some seem to  be
armour plated and require
more hits to destroy, others
seem to be able to shrug off
the new programming and
turn against you once more.
And the dangerous bit is that
you can't tell when they have
lost their friendship.

OF ARAGON
SSI (US Gold) - E29.99
Roleplaying, politics and war are all
part of this fantasy epic.
T
has died leaving you,
his son, to your des-
tiny. A destiny that demands
for you to lead your people
against the orc and goblin
hordes and into battle with
your enemies to the East.
Only when you are liberator
and leader of all Aragon will
you fulﬁll your father's will.
Your ﬁrst decision may
be your most difﬁcult as you
must choose a  character
class to be throughout the
game. You can be a great
Warrior, Knight, Ranger,
Priest or Mage -  the last
three making up their lack
of ﬁghting strength with
magic.
Your choice of class also
effects the type of armies you
will raise as, for example, a
Warner can build infantry
for half the cost of others.
Money plays an impor-
tant part of the game as you
must manage your city's
affairs by setting tax rates
and choosing between rais-
ing an army or developing
trade and industry. Both
have their priorities since
you need an army to defend
your city and expand, but
you need resources t o
develop, train and pay for it.
You also have to remember
that the townsfolk may not
like paying taxes at 80% and
may strike, leave or rebel,
scuppering your chances of
success.
As Duke you must prove
yourself as a leader and a
statesman by dealing with
envoys from other towns
and resolving local disputes
that can have an effect on
your people's health, morale
and loyalty. These in turn
effect your revenue and the
upkeep or expansion of your
army.
Each turn represents a
month of time in which you
must manage your resour-
ces, defend your territory
and expand to liberate the
land. Which will inevitably
lead to battles. When a battle
erupts you must organise
your forces for the fray.
Obviously, your tactics will
vary depending on the oppo-
sition you fact and the units
you have at your disposal.
Personally, I  favour bow-
men that can weaken an
opponent before it reaches
you. Where they can be
crushed by cavalry charges
or by infantry armed with
swords, javelins or spears.
Priests, M  ages a n d
Rangers should be kept safe
behind the line where they
can use their magic t o
greater effect. (Although
you represent one class you
can hire members of  the
others to supplement your
armies). Unlike other SSI
games where magic users
cast lightning bolts and hurl
ﬁreballs the magic in this
game is more subtle. These
spells effect the movement
and ﬁghting ability of friend
and foe by changing the
terrain o r  slowing a n
advance. Stamina can be
restored or  drained and
armies can be healed, con-
fused, terriﬁed or tele ported.
As the battle continues in
turns (up to a maximum of
23) victory points a r e
awarded for losses inﬂicted
and territory gained, which
ﬁnally decide the outcome of
the battle. A loss will cause
a drop in morale and loyalty
but a great win will bring
plundered gold, new recruits
for your army and expe-
rience for your troops. After
a few battle these points will
amass to form increases in
levels which will bring more
spells to your magic users
and better ﬁghting skills to
your units. For  example,
level 4  mounted bowmen
cause more damage with
every attack than level I, 2
or 3.
The result is a fascinating
game in which you gradually
explore the resources and
forces that you have and
learn how to use them to
expand your empire. The
incredibily high Lastibility
factor is well earned as it's
the style of game that you
actually enjoy the more your
play. Starting with a  lost
period when you're not quite
sure what you're doing you
gain military and character
experience which sends you
back for more and more. I'm
afraid I'm not going to get
much sleep until Aragon is
free and I've earned the 600
points needed to complete
the game.

Our eponymous hero,
part time explorer, part time
stamp collector and whole
time good guy has been on
the trail of a long lost South
American tribe for many a
long year. B y  a  strange
coincidence, when his plane
runs Out o f fuel over the
jungle, he just happens to
land at the entrance to the
very Aztec temple he was
searching for.
Getting in proved to  e
easy. Getting out at the other
end was decidedly more
problematical. N o  sooner
had th e  d o o r slammed
behind him than a  huge
stone ball starts to chase him
down the passage. With no
time to change your name
from Rick Dangerous to
Rick Moss (because as we
all know, a  rolling stone
gathers no Moss!) (Ha ha,
very droll. Get on with it -

option is to throw yourself
off the cliff at the end of the
tunnel. Surprise surprise,

follows you...

of spears shooting out the
walls, before you ﬁnally
reach the other end. Then
you can try your hand at
three other scenarios includ-
ing a mighty fortress and an
Egyptian tomb.
In order to defend your-
self, you can poke things
with your stick. Timing is all
important here and I found
the technique useful only
against bats. Natives are best
dispatched w i th  a  swift
bullet but you only carry a
few o f these and the noise
they make is all too likely
to set off a trap. You will
also need dynamite to blast
your way past rock falls and
the like.

game is the lack of variety.
Problems are usually only
solved by trial and error -
you frequently have to throw
yourself into the unknown.
Once you have solved that
part of the game though, it
is unlikely to  cause you
further stress and soon
becomes repetitive. Fun and
simple to  play, I  would
suggest that it is overpriced
somewhat. It would make a
very good budget game.

land's most famous bird,
they are totaly incapable of
ﬂight, n o t very good a t
swimming and pretty ugly to
boot. They d o  have one
redeeming quality though,
they are extremely loyal. So
when 20 o f  Ti ki  Kiwi's
friends are captured by a
psychotic walrus, he doesn't
hesitate. Armed only with
his bow and arrow, he sets
off to rescue his friends
before they experience a

The game is a variation
on the old ladder arid plat-
form theme, but is none the
worse for that, having been
skillfully converted from the
arcade original.
You must reach all o f
your friends within a certain
time allowance. A  rader

price of one is always
worth a  look as i t
often offers great value for
money. This one bundles
together Gremlins football
games starring two of the top
names i n  football, Gary
Lineker and Roy o f  the
Rovers. However, before
you think that all football
games are the same, check-
out these as each one offers
an unique challenge.
Gary Lineker's Superstar
Soccer is the traditional style
of football game with a
scrolling side on view of the
pitch and joystick controlled
players. In the game you can
take control o f the centre
forward, goalkeeper and
manager - as which you can
pick your team from a squad
of players and decide team
tactics by telling forwards to
shoot or pass, and defence
to either stay back or sup-
port the forwards. Perhaps,
the best part of the game is
that the forwards don't just
shoot at goal willy nilly they
can also attempt spectacular
goal attempts with headers
and overhead kicks i f the
ball's at the right height.
Gary Lineker's Super-
skills is a selection of train-
ing exercises, that inclues
gym training (such a s
pushups and squat thrusts),
ﬁeld work (including drib-
bling, chipping and shoot-
ing) and ball control - where
you must keep the ball off
the ground by bouncing it
off various parts o f  your
anatomy.
Roy of the Rovers is a
curious m i x  o f  football
action and arcade adven-
ture, as some unscrupulous
gang has kidnapped the
Meichester Rovers team just
before a big exhibition game
that could save the club from
the developer's bulldozers.
In a race against time you
must avoid enemy suppor-
ters, hoodlums, traps and
ambushes and ﬁnd the other
four players, otherwise you
will have to face the oppo-
sition alone.
The fourth game is the
intriguing Footballer of the
Year which plays like a
board game and casts you
as a 17 year old just entering
football. Through taking the
limited scoring chances that
fall your way i n  action
sequences you will earn
money and be spotted by
scouts from other teams.
gradually taking you from
fourth division obscurity to
ﬁrst division and interna-
tional football, and perhaps
the ultimate accolade as the
Footballer of the Year.
Although together they
represent a good footballing
package they are, at best,
2nd division games as they
lack the quality and depth
of the top of the genre.

Despite the ridiculous
waddle our heroes are mean,
if a little limited. As they
move through the maze
complex of the Xybots their
progress is shown on a small,
colourless section o f  the
screen. This fault typiﬁes
two player games o f  this

players to  play simultane-
ously, the loss o f playing
area often spoils the game-
play. And when nearly half
the screen is taken up with
stats and a  map, things
become a  little ridiculous.
The only advantage in this
game when playing with two
players is the ability to shoot
each other in the back and
the combined ﬁrepower.
The Xybots are a mechan-
ical race and not conﬁned to
the usual limitation o f the
humble organic body. This
means they can move a lot
faster. carry more armour
and pack twice as much
punch into their shots. Des-

searching for criminals to
apprehend. However, these
crooks are far from danger-

enough of these to meet your

Your job is made easier
by the fact that these crooks

drive up behind them. sound

help you, you can also pull
into a gas station for more

give you more time and visit
a speed shop to soup up your
patrol car by adding armour,
extra speed, acceleration,
and even a  gun to  shoot
more serious crooks.
By day three o f  your

called to track down a more
serious criminal going under
a subtle pseudonym, such as

only would we have brains the size of amoebas, but we would be led
to think that Michael Jackson has committed every strange act known
to man, short of living on the moon.
Luckily most people have the sense to shun such comments and try to
understand the man as a human being. He was born in 1960 in Gary, Indiana.
where he. and four of his brothers, formed a band which was to take the
world by storm.
The Jackson 5 were ﬁrst brought to attention in 1968 when they auditioned
for Motown Records. And it was their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show
in 1969 that brought them ﬁrmly into the public eye. Michael was the lead

singer, and was but 9 years of age when they experienced their ﬁrst number
one hit,
When Michael was 12 he recorded 'Ben', which was the ﬁrst solo hit of
many, and it was in 1978 that he split from his family group to explore the
world of music, and superstardom, on his own, This was after appearing in
the pop remake of The Wizard of Oz, entitled The Wiz.
Although he was already at this point a star in the genre, the album Thriller
placed him in the record books. He received 58 platinum records in 28 countries,
F E A T U R E  •

•  FEATURE
and in America he was awarded no less than 8 grammys. To date Thriller
has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, and is still selling.
How does one follow that? Easy, one makes ones ﬁrst feature length movie
based on ones own records.
Moonwalker is Michael's ﬁrst feature length ﬁlm (having previously only
done shorts, such as Thriller) and is titled after his best-selling autobiography
— which is named after the dance that he has perfected so well. It deals with
all the subjects that Michael has shown as being dear to his heart y o u t h ,
friendship, drug abuse, bad journalism, and villainy — and in true fairy-tale
fashion, he takes many obstacles and shows how to overcome them (yep kids,
this is all believable stuff. If  you are confronted by a drug baron and his
troops, just transform into a large robot and blow the heck out of them).
The plot follows Michael and three friends (one of which is Sean Lennon)
through various sub-plots, all of which are interlinked by Mr. Big — an evil
drug baron with an evil haircut. First prob that Mike faces is the journalists
at a Hollywood studio, they are hungry for blood and wish to grab some
Jackson negative (any resemblance between these journos and the cut-throats
found at Argus is purely intentional).
He manages to elude them by wearing a rabbit mask, and in some smooth
puppetry, he speeds away on a motorcycle until he ﬁnally escapes their ruthless
pencils. This is not the only transformation that he undertakes in Moonwalker.
Like I said earlier, he also transforms himself into a very large Transformer-
like robot, and even more unbelievably, a mammoth space ship, as which
he ﬁnishes the battle with a few deft swivels of his thrusters. Moonwaiker
is deﬁnitely intended for kids, and has many charms which makes it ideal
for such an audience.
It also makes it ideal for a computer game. Which is just as well as US
Gold has secured the licence and will pixelise Michael Jackson's exploits in
time for November, and thus Christmas.
The game follows the plot of the ﬁlm very closely and is split into 4 levels.
The action is played in a maze-like game with a top-down view, although
in-between each level there is a moderately large action sequence. It follows
all the transformations, climaxing in a VERY large action sequence featuring
the Spaceship Jackson.
The music throughout the movie is also going to be converted onto the
home computer, with relevant song appearing in relevant sections, and the
whole game is going to be very movie-esque. US Gold is very excited about
this project and, with the help of the Keypunch Corporation of Minneapolis.
Moonwalker is likely to be a success Worldwide (much like Michael himself).
If US Gold only sell I% the amount of copies as the record Bad did,
everybody up in Birmingham will be happy likkle bunnies.

DOS users, whether ﬂedglings or old hand. This month it's a mixed
bag of mainly software reviews, plus an intro to batch ﬁles. First
though, I'm going to kick off with a couple of news items.
Lotus corp (sec Magellan review) has been busy lately. Not only has it
got both 123 releases 2.2 and 3.0 onto the streets, but has upgraded the help
available through its dealer network. The new system uses a CD-ROM disk
called unimaginatively, CD/PROMPT. With over 10,000 pages of information
on the disk, that time honoured excuse of 'Oh it's not in the manual, we'll
have to check with head ofﬁce' no longer holds any water.
With the intel 80486 chip now becoming available as upgrades for systems
such as the IBM PS2, and AST Premium 386 machines, speculation over
processor upgrades for other machines is rife. It seems however that commodore
who only has 20Mhz '386 is not yet to be tempted, or was it caught out?
Certainly the much rumoured 386SX machine is on the stocks, but what else?
Batch File Fun
It is often thought that MSDos computers do not have a programming language
built in. In fact they do, the so-called Batch language, which really is just
an extension of MSDos.
Batch programs are just like those you may have written in Basic, but
there are differences, The commands available are somewhat limited, and each
program is really a text ﬁle. However, some useful things can be done, For
example with Autoexec.bat. This is the Batch program that controls the
computer at start up, so it's very important M u c h  can be done with

Autoexec,bat, and 1 may cover the options in Luton: columns, but tor now
here is a simple mod for you single drive users. The following text should
be prepared with whatever editor you use, and saved as a text-only ﬁle.
echo off
path=a:
prompt SpSg
copy command.com c:
You should also prepare another text ﬁle with the following command:
Files = 20
Buffers = 20
device = Ramdrive.sys
Set comspec = C: command. corn
Next, make a working copy o f your
to it. Also copy the ﬁle Ramdrive.sys
Autoexec.bat, and the second Conﬁg.sys
as normal, except for a message similar to
boot disk and copy both text ﬁles
to the disk. Rename the ﬁrst ﬁle
Reboot, and everything should go
this:
Microsoft Ramdrive Version 2.01 virtual disk c:
Disk size 64k
Sector size 512 bytes
Allocation unit 1 sectors
Directory entries 64
What you have done is created a RAM disk which becomes drive c;, and
copied Command.com to it. You may well be wondering what this will do
for you. The answer is that you should no longer see messages like this:
Invalid Command.com
Insert Command.com disk in default drive and strike any key when ready.
Command.com will always be available to the system, and irritating disk
swaps kept to a minimum. Hard disk owners can still use this trick incidentally,
as it does speed things up somewhat. The one drawback of course being that
memory is lost to the system. Note, this is only meant as an example and
some programs will not work under this conﬁguration of DOS.
Typogratica
Just about everybody these days has heard of DTP, however fewer people
actually put the theory into practice. Reasons for this are complex. An important
factor has been the gap between low-priced low-performance systems, and
the more exclusive Postscript based kit. Some might regard this state of affairs
as a bonus, preventing the perpetration of typographic disasters on the world.
One way of narrowing the gap is to provide the low end user with some
of the excellent fonts hitherto only available to Postscript users. This GST
have done, with their Typograﬁca range of outline fonts. The normal way
of acquiring these is by purchasing one of the two collections. Prime, consists
of Sans, Serif, and Courier which is the equivalent of Helvetica, Times and
Courier on Postscript printers. Standard, has all the rest, and is much more
interesting, with such things as Zapf Dingbats and Sans Narrow. Together
they make up the equivalent of the 13 fonts available as standard on Postscript
printers. The two collections come complete with a three ring binder, manual,
disks and poster showing the fonts available. Individual fonts are also available.
If you want to make use of the fonts, you have to install them ﬁrst. This
is a clumsy process at best, and irritating at worst. Everything has to be speciﬁed
from menus and sub-menus, you can't just whizz around the screen selecting
items at will. Also, as the program generates bit-mapped fonts, the time taken
can be excessive. For example, I speciﬁed an extensive range of point sizes
from 6 to 72 in a single style of one outline font. Typograﬁca suggested 18
minutes 31 seconds to generate the fonts, which then occupied 3Mbyte on
my hard drive. Of this, the 72 point style occupied no less than 1.5Mbyte.
Simple mathematics then gave me a ﬁgure of 72M bytes for the six fonts supplied
as part of the standard collection. The moral has to be, use the minimum
7 1 1
YOUR COMMODORE

number of fonts necessary to do the job, unless you have a massive hard
disk. Unfortunately you are then severely hampered in your choice of fonts,
effectively back to square one. And what happens if you wish to use the fonts
with two or three different applications?
On the plus side, a large number of applications and output devices are
supported including typesetting machines. These however can only be used
if you specify the postscript names for the fonts when generating them.
My overall verdict; a cost-effective way of widening the scope of your DTP
work, but really needs a large hard disk to get the most out of it.
Lotus Magellan
Magellan has been hailed as one of a new breed o f DOS shells. What's a
DOS shell you ask? Strictly speaking, they are a way o f controlling DOS
without using the system prompt. That includes everything from simple batch
programs to MS Windows. A stricter deﬁnition however, would add the fact
that some part should remain in memory while your programs are running.
This allows the main section to be reloaded when your program terminates.
By that deﬁnition, Magellan is the Rolls Royce of DOS shells. It has elements
of artiﬁcial intelligence with its 'fuzzy
that allow you to treat all the ﬁles on disk as one enormous database.
Magellan builds an Index of ﬁles stored on your hard disk, knows from
a list of templates what is in those ﬁles displaying the contents accordingly.
Dbase and Lotus 123 ﬁles are just two types it knows about.
You can search for data in ﬁles in several ways using the Explore option.
Magellan's ﬁle viewers allows it to display the contents of the ﬁles in a form
near to that of the creating applications. Thus Lotus 123 ﬁles are displayed
in row and column format, DBase ﬁles as tables, and so on. Launch (F7)
is another powerful command, because i t not only allows you to start up
programs from within Magellan, but also gives extensive control over the
process. It does this by making use of the powerful Macro facility built into
Magellan. Of course it's not perfect, but it could save you a lot of key strokes
over the year.
All the other facilities, such as copying, deleting, renaming and printing
ﬁles are also present. and as you would expect from such a polished product
are well implemented.
Documentation is probably the most sumptuous I have ever seen. There
is a ring bound manual, plus two small booklets, and all reek of class. However
I found the content pedestrian, if thorough. Full marks though for Index and
Glossary, essential for this kind of product.
Magellan is a well ﬁnished program, but what will be its uses? Clearly
Lotus intends the product to ﬁt in with its current base o f corporate 123
users, but who else? Certainly anyone who needs to organise their hard disk,
or where a number of people need to access data on one machine. But, the
kind of disorganised people who do need Magellan are, by deﬁnition, the
least likely to purchase it.

the dictionary entry above contains a phrase which sums up its deﬁnition
perfectly. "Pictorial publication full of horrors" may not say 'Beano'
to you, but we're moving into the 1990s. And the comic industry is coming
with us.
Long gone are the days when children ﬂocked to the newsagents to see
if Spiderman had vanquished Doctor Octopus (again) and i f Superman had
pulverised Lex Luthor (again). Now dark landscapes are the settings for brutal
crimes and many superheroes keep their boxer shorts inside their trousers,
Batman has acquired weaponry (and lost a partner). Dan Dare (the great,
great, great, great, etc. grandson of the original that is) has died and been
resurrected. And even Judge Dredd has turned from being a facist psychotic
killer into an old facist psychotic killer.
This can be put down to one thing: Comics are no longer for children
only. A fact that became apparent when Viz was launched in December 1979.
The publishers now claim to sell around 800,000 copies every two months.
The content is crude, barbaric, and at best can be described as toilet humour,
which goes half way to explaining why [(and another 799,999 dedicated readers)
love it so much.
YOUR COMMODORE

Another recent comic which has conformed one famous character to a
more adult status is The Dark Knight Returns'. Written by Frank Miller
- who is, at this very moment, writing the script and screenplay for Robocop
2 - it looks at the future of Batman, and plots a ﬁtting end to the caped
crusaders career. Many scenes from The Dark Knight were converted into
cellular format via Tim Burton's Batman masterpiece, thus proving what a
strong plot Frank had devised.
But these were just the ﬁrst of the 'mature' readers comics. There was
an enormous ﬂood of them in 1987 and '88, and we can expect many more
to come. One other of honourable note is 'Watchmen' by British comic author
Alan Moore. It examines superheroes in a realistic society and comes to the
conclusion that heroics is something frowned upon by a majority of 'real'
people. Of course, like Dark Knight became Batman, Terry Gilliam has already
signed on the dotted line to convert this piece of comic literature onto the
Both of these products catne from American based DC Comics. There
are of course many British comics that hold their own in the UK market.
One such comic is 2000AD. Founded in 1977, it sought to replace The Eagle
as a space-age action paper for young and old, fortunately it did far more
than that.
It has established itself as the top of it's kind (although competition is
very scarce) and it's characters are now household names (in my household
anyway!). As from it's 650th issue, they should all become household names
in America too, as it will be in the shops there at the same time as here.
Also under the 2000AD name is Crisis, a comic that seeks to educate whilst
remaining enjoyable and not too heavy. Dealing with political and social values,
it is incredibly well-drawn and it is a rare comic that will get me into a newsagent
cinema screens.

Another new magazine to come our way is Deadline, which is edited by
two of 2000A Ds greatest artists. It can be described as a more down-to-earth, ) t
pop-culture version of 2000AD, more than anything else, and it seems to be
doing extremely well (having just held it's ﬁrst birthday party at the Limelight
club in London's West End). It contains several strips, such as the now infamous
'Tank Girl' by Jamie Hewlett, and a few interviews and features on up-to-
the-minute items. Deadline is monthly and it comes highly recommended.

Where DC are seeking to update their characters, Marvel haven't quite
got the idea yet. That said, Marvel UK has recently released an amusing little
monthly titled The Sleeze Brothers'. This is a sort o f Blues Brothers in the
future. it follows the exploits of two private eyes in a city full of debauchery,
crime, sex and violence (although not necessarily in that order). It is very!
humourous and is well worth seeking out.

down as this may ruin the feel of the game, but the cover will display a sign
to the effect of 'mature garners only'.
Ocean, of course, has Batman -  the movie, but it also has the rights to
Watchmen.
The Edge has The Punisher (a vigilante driven by his family's death at
the hands o f a crime organisation) and The X-Men (a superhero troupe
gaining many rough and ready characters). It has also announced a few
more to come next year -  Daredevil (a blind superhero who is anti-drugs,
and just about anti everything else as well), and Wolverine (a character who
has large, very sharp claws that he can extend from his knuckles).O

Empire has Doctor Doom's Revenge, which is based around the Fantastic
Four's oldest and most feared enemy.
Rumour also has it that there will be new games based on (wait for it):
Captain America, Judge Dredd, The Swamp Thing, X-Factor, The New
Mutants, and Rogue Trooper. We can be guaranteed though that this will
not be the end, thete is a whole universe of licenses just waiting to be grabbed.

three-dimensional quality to

useful routine for your to use. It's
very short, so there isn't endless lists
of data to type in.
Examples o f  three-dimensional
sprites which spring to mind are the
Nrarious sport simulations, such as
'International Soccer.'
As you probably know, sprites
have a deﬁnite priority arrangement
in that the lower the sprite number

the higher is its priority. This means
that sprite 0 has the highest, through
to sprite 7 which has the lowest.
Sprites w i th  higher priority
always display in front of those with
a lower priority. This is ﬁxed within
the hardware o f the VIC I I  chip,
which means i f you want to create
a three-dimensional illusion, then a
routine needs to  be constructed
which will manage the sprites by
keeping 'foreground' sprites higher in
priority.
To handle this, I  decided that
sprites lower down the screen would
be considered as 'foreground' to those
higher up the screen. I'm sure you
know that the pixel map is arranged
with the 'Y• coordinate running from
0 at the top of the screen, to 255 at
the bottom. The Machine Language
routine, SPRITE PRIORITIES,
uses the 'Y' coordinate information
to decide which sprite should be
where the sprite with the greater 'Y'
value becoming sprite 0, and so on.

together with all data relevent to each
(ie: Image, Mcm, Xpos, Ypos,
Colours etc). This neatly holds
together the illusion that a sprite's
priority is changing - ﬁrst passing in
front of, then behind another sprite.
This does, however, pose a tricky
problem! Let's say that the joystick
is being used to control one particular
sprite element. Normally that control
would be deﬁned and controlled
using one particular sprite -  say,
sprite O. All that needs to be done
is to peek and poke (or M L  equi-
valent) with 'Y' coordinate informa-
tion into sprite O. However, should
sprite 0 move up the screen and pass
the next sprite, then CONTROL
shifts to sprite I, and if CONTROL
carries on up the screen i t might
become sprite 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7.
2. BASIC  D E M O  -  F o r  p ro -
grammers, and to show the system
working, the basic demo program
outlines a demonstration of SPRITE
PRIORITIES in action, as well as
useful routines for the controlling of
which sprites are where. When you
'RUN' the program (that is after
loading SPRITE PRIORITIES, and
typing 'NEW', then loading BASIC
DEMO), eight sprites are displayed
diagonally across the screen. The
images are simple coloured blocks.
Their default values are:
Block I = White
Block 2 = Red
Block 3 = Cyan
Block 4 = Purple
Block 5 = Green
Block 6 = Blue
Block 7 = Yellow
Block 8 = Orange
You can use the numerical keys
(1-8) to select any one of the eight
blocks. That block will now be under
CONTROL, and can be manipulated
around the screen using the joystick
plugged into port 2.
If you study the listing, you will
see that in the INITALISE routine
(lines 68-78) variables 'N' and 'K '
have been declared, and the two
arrays F() and DS() dimensioned. At
line 76 the arrays are ﬁlled F ( )  with
0 to 7 and DSO with the 'Y' coor-
dinate value of each sprite, from 0
to 7.
he array F() holds the current
position o f  the BLOCK (not the
sprite) on the screen, and DSO -
which derives from 'Dummy sprite'
- holds the current 'Y' location o f
where each sprite would be, should
there be no SPRITE PRIORITIES
manipulation.
The variable 'K' is used to shift
joystick CONTROL over the block
selected from the numerical key
input. A loop checks through the F()
array to  ﬁnd the current screen
position in relationship to the sprite.
For example, BLOCK 5 might be at
the bottom of the screen, and so it
would be sprite O. Where 'N' is set
to equal the actual sprite value i n
the foregoing example, O. When the
joystick i s moved u p  o r  down,
program control will call either
JOYSTICK UP (commencing at line
21) or JOYSTICK DOWN (line 32).
Let's say 'up' is the selection. First
DS(K) is decremented (K=Block
being moved), and th e  screen

parameters are checked (line 22).
Then the updated value in DS(K) is
poked into the 'Y' register o f the
sprite holding the data fo r that
BLOCK: 'N' holds the sprite number.
Next, the CONTROL sprite's 'Y'
coordinate is checked against the
next lesser prioritised sprite ' Y '
coordinate. If CONTROL is greater,
then it maintains priority and so the
program skips lines 25-27 and returns
to MAINLOOP - no more needing
to be done. However, should the
coordinate value now be less, then
line 25 calls the ML routine SPRITE
PRIORITIES, where priority and all
relevent sprite data is toggled from
one to the other. On return from the
ML routine, 'N' is now incremented
to the next highest sprite number.
This is followed by an error trap, and
UPDATE F(lag) ARRAY (line 64),
vvhich will update F(N) fo r the
current sprite position. Moving down
the screen is the reverse of the above
- check out lines 32-39. Left and right
have no effect upon priority, and so
these are standard routines to Peek
and Poke 'X' coordinates.
A Stage Further
To take things a stage further and
have multiple sprite movement on the
screen, the variable 'N' would need
to become an eight element array.
Each image, block, o r  whatever.
would be given a constant value from
0 to 7, and when the program updates
'Y' coordinates fo r each element.
N(Element Number) would be used.
This could be followed by a line such
as:
ON ( E L E M E N T  N U M B E R )
GOSUB (PARAMETERS)
Here subroutines would handle
differing images, or elements, and/
or situations.
I have not incorporated a colli-
sion detect routine within the Basic
demo as the main purpose is to show
how effective SPRITE PRIORI-
TIES is, and to offer a demonstration
of a method o f  control. Collision
detect should operate quite normal
without any problems. Fo r  M L
programmers, the conversion of the
Basic demo routines into source
should prove to be quite elementary.

Should you decide to  use these

will now have to make some changes

you can now know for sure that the
ﬁrms you deal with are decent, honest
and true, Well, actually you can only
use it to ﬁnd out whether the VAT
numbers they put on their invoices
are genuine or not. But this does go
quite a long way towards proving
their crudentials. You will, once you
start using this program as a regular
part of your book keeping routine,
sleep more easily at night, safe in the
knowledge that you haven't forked
out ﬁfteen per cent over the odds for
your goods, and that the Taxman
won't be claiming you've cheated him
with phony invoices.
The program is written in Basic,
and will run on the CM, Cl28, Plus
4 and C16. To use it, simply enter
the nine digit VAT number and press
return. The program will respond
with the appropriate message:
VAT number is valid
or:
VAT number is not valid
Simplicity itself! The program is
foolproof, objecting to  any input
which is not a nine digit number. If
such an input i s attempted, an
appropriate error message will be

printed before the program reports
that the VAT number is not valid.
The program is in two parts, to
make customisation or integration as
a subroutine into your own programs
easier. The ﬁrst pan, lines 100 to 180,
inputs the VAT number, sends it to
the subroutine that actually checks
the number, and then interprets and
prints the result. It then asks whether
the user wishes to  check another
number. I f  they do, the process is
repeated. If not, the program ENDs
on line 180. The second part of the
program, line 200-260, contains the
checking routine itself.
The checking routine returns the
result of its check in two variables:
V and E. If V=0, the VAT number
is not valid. If V=-1, the VAT number
is valid. However, before the validity
of the number is checked, the input
itself is checked for errors. If E is
not equal to zero upon return from
the routine, it means that such an
error has been detected. If E=1 the
input contains less than nine char-
acters (the length o f  any V A T
number). If E=2 the input contains
more than nine characters. If E=3 the
input contains non-numeric charac-
ters. I f  any o f  these errors are
detected, V is always set to zero, since
the input could not have been a
genuine VAT number. It should be
noted that spaces are stripped from
the input before it is checked. This
usefully enables VAT numbers to be
input inclusive of spaces, as they so
often appear on invoices. Upon
return from the surbourine, VS will
contain the original input, stripped
of spaces.
The whole program can be turned
into a single subroutine by simply
replacing EN D  i n  line 180 with
RETURN. However, should you
wish to use only the checking sub-
routine (lines 200-260), then the VAT
number to be checked must ﬁrst be
put into A $  before executing a
GOSUB to the routine. As we have
seen, the result of the check will be
returned in variables V and E. Since
there are n o  GOTOs within the
checking subroutine, renumbering it
for incorporation into one's own
programs is simplicity itself.
The calculation used i n  this
program has been extensively tested,
and is a form of the calculation used
by the Tax Ofﬁce to create the VAT
numbers i n  the ﬁrst place. Fo r
obvious reasons, i t  was thought
rather counter productive to include
that calculation in this program. As
an incidental observation, it would
appear that using their present
system, it is only possible for the Tax
Ofﬁce to issue a maximum o f ten
million VAT numbers.

the world such as Atlantis,
UFO's and, probably the grea-
test o f them all, the difﬁculty o f
moving the te xt and character
memory round. This program has
been written to end the last of those
myths.
Moving the text screen has many
uses, take fo r example menus i n
adventures and windows i n  word
processors. These must not harm the
text beneath them and one method
of doing this is to move the screen
under interrupts (if the menu isn't
over the text it can't harm it). This
program will also allow you to make
small alterations to the character set
without needing to use a character
designer.
I have included two versions of
this program in the listings. The ﬁrst
is a machine code version (for speed)
and the second a Basic listing (for
ease o f understanding). A l l  lazy
readers should note that the Basic
listing can be typed in and compiled
to save messing around with data
statements.
The programme requires 3 var-
iables:-
1. A  Complex Interface Adaptor
Bank (CIA)
2. A  screen pointer within the bank
3. A  character pointer

The C.I.A. bank picks out a block
of I6K The screen pointer cuts this
into 1K blocks which mark the start
of each screen.
CHARACTER POINTER:
This is like the screen pointer except
that, as the primary character set is
2K long, it is cut into 2K blocks (I
haven't copied the second set so try
changing to  i t when you run the
program).
This is all you need to know to
run the program (the addresses of the
parameters are in the listing). But if
you wish to understand the program,
read on. -
Changing the C.I.A. BANK
(lines 270-290)
The ﬁrst thing to note about this is
that the bank numbers run in the
wrong order. The number 0 denotes
the fourth block (49152-65535) and
the number 3 denotes the ﬁrst block
(0-16384). This is sorted on line 80
by subtracting three from the bank
number.
It should also be noted that before
the bank can be changed, the C.I.A.
must be set for input. This is done
by °Ring 56578 (and 252) with the
bank number (0-3). The only thing
left to do is to inform the ROM that
you have moved the screen (it is
another bank now). The location 648
holds the screen address dividedby
255. To inform the ROM, you need
to OR 648 (and 63) with 64* the video
bank. Once this is done the bank is
changed and you can change the
screen address.
Changing the Screen
Address (lines 340-50)
This is easier than changing the
C.I.A. bank. The upper 4 bits o f
address 53272 hold the screen pointer
so you just OR 53272 (and 15) with
16* the screen pointer. Again, the
ROM must be informed o f  the
screen's movement. This is accomp-
lished by °Ring 648 (and 192) with
4* the screen pointer. The screen has
now been moved and you can now
move the character set.
Changing the character
address (line 400)
This is the easiest part of the pro-
gram. The lower 4 bits of 53272 hold
the character pointer. As the char-
acter pointer rises in 2K blocks, twice
the pointer is stored there. This is
done by °Ring 53272 (and 241) with
2* the character pointer.
The C.I.A. screen and characters
have now been moved but you still
can't use this program because you
have not copied the character set yet.

Copying the character data
(lines 180-230)
While this is not difﬁcult, it is the
most difﬁcult part of this program.
The difﬁculty is in looking at the
character ROM and making sure you
are not interrupted. These problems
are solved by two pokes, one to
address 56334, to ensure that you are
not interrupted, and the other to
address I to allow you to look at the
character ROM. The rest of this part
of the program just copies memory
and sets addresses I and 56334 back
to their original values.

128 Users
Doing this in Basic is much easier
for 128 users. The process of copying
the character ROM only requires you
to use the command Bank14 to gain
access to the character ROM but a
full guide to this can be found on
pages 260-263 o f the 128 reference
guide.
The Machine code program
This is a short program encoded in
data statements which has only 2
major differences from the Basic
program.
The ﬁrst difference is that while
in the basic program numbers are
entered from 1 to n, in the machine
code version they must be in the form
0 to N or the program will not work.
The second difference is in the
order o f the subroutines. I n  this
program, the screen moving routine
is last, so i t can be called upon
independently by an SYS command
(SYS49364).
The position o f the parameters
(addresses 49152-54) is shown in the
listing, as are the SYS addresses, so
all I  ca n  say n o w  i s  "happy
programming".

Produce those colour
fades with this simple
to use program
By R. Hoben
I
bit closer at a piece of software,
you w i l l  notice many little
touches that add a little bit more to
the presentation. These touches can
be anything from swirling sprites to
colour effects. In this article I would
like to discuss the use of colours to
produce a fade effect, which when
used in conjunction with your own
program can create great title and
instruction screens.
The ﬁrst thing we must deﬁne is:
What exactly is a fade? A  fade is
basically where something, be it a
sprite, gradually appears or disap-
pears into the background. When an
item appears, it is known as a fade-
in and when it disappears, a fade-
out.
FADE THEORY: DIAGRAM 1
NOTHING VISIBLE.
THE LETTER IS THE
SAME COLOUR AS
THE BACKGOUND.
YOUR COMMODORE
In order to make the item fade,
we must cycle it through a sequence
of colours. To help you understand
this, we will take a practical example.
I want an instruction screen faded
in from a black background and the
instructions to end up in the colour
yellow. We  must now create the
necessary colour sequence. The ﬁrst
colour should be the background
colour - which in this case is black
($OO). We  now want the text to
gradually move from dark to light.
The colours best suited for this are
the three grey colours. So we add:
Dark grey (SOB), Medium grey (WC)
and light grey (SOF).
Next we have an intermediate
colour, which in this case is white
($00). This intermediate colour is
LETTER GRADUALLY BECOMES BRIGHTER AS
IT RUNS THROUGH THE 3 SHADES OF GREY
preferably the opposite of the back-
ground. Lastly we put our ﬁnal
colour in which is yellow ($07)'. I f
we had chosen the ﬁnal colour to be
light red then we could have put dark
red in after white and then light red
in order to provide a smoother colour
transition. If you look at diagram I
then you will see this whole example
simpliﬁed.
Hopefully you should have fol-
lowed all that. If you look at diagram
2, you will see the complete sequence
for our example. So how do you use
this sequence in your own programs?
If y o u  t y p e  i n  F A D E R
LOADER, which is in Basic, and run
it, it will generate a program on disk
called FADER.MC. Now in your
Basic or Mi C program all you have

to do is load FADER.MC and then
poke the values for your sequence
into location $CO35 (49205) onwards,
terminating the sequence with $FF
(255). Now all you have to do is print
the text you want to be faded onto
the screen in the SAME colour as
the background. E.g. i f  you are
fading the text i n  from a  black
background, then print the text onto
the screen in black. It is then only
a matter of typing SYS49I52 and hey
presto!
If you want to see this in action,
then type in FADER DEMO and run
it. Note, you must have FAD ER.MC
on the tape or disk ﬁrst. I have preset
the demo to do the fade in as in the
example I have just given. Now that
Forty Two
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
you know how to fade-in, you can
fade-out simply b y reversing the
sequence.
This fade technique can be app-
lied to  sprites and high resolution
screens. Hopefully you should be
able to develop your own programs
to do this. An example of doing a
fade with sprites is given i n  the
program SPRITE FADE.
On a ﬁnal note, you should have
no problems typing in the programs
as they are all in Basic. Also for those
of you interested, I  have given a
rough now diagram for FADER, MC
which is shown in diagram 3. So there
you have everything you need and
hopefully you should be able to put
this excellent technique to good use

the best o f times This problem may have put many people off trying
to program for themselves. One of the main inadequacies in the language
is the functions designed to handle string variables, that is, LEFTS, RIGHTS
and MIDS. I will describe the use of these functions in detail later. Basically,
they allow the programmer to  extract 'chunks' from string variables to
manipulate within the program. Very well, you say, so what is wrong with
that? Well, the problem is that while you can use LEFTS etc. to extract bits
from strings, see ﬁgure I. you are not allowed to surgically change parts of
a string, see ﬁgure 2,
Figure I
AS="ABC"
PRINT LEFTS (A$,2)
the result would be: AB
Figure 2
AS-7-"ABC"
Now, supposing you wanted to change the 'AB' to 'DE' you might type:
LEFTS(AS,2)="DE"
the result would be: ?syntax error
As you can see, the computer will let you see what is there, but you are
not permitted to change it. Many other forms of Basic do allow this function.
Wouldn't it be nice if, just like using DEF FN in arithemetic, we could deﬁne
functions to allow us to alter strings?. But, you have guessed it, C64 Basic
will not allow it. I thought that this was inconvenient to say the least, and
so I produced a series of subroutines which would allow me to alter my strings.
I will start at the beginning and describe to you how each function works,
and how the surgical version of it works.
LEFTS
This function lets you take the leftmost characters from a string. The syntax
is: LEFTS (stringS, elements), where elements = the amount of characters you
wish to extract. This number can obviously not be greater than the number
of characters in the string.

strings with this clear,
concise explanation

RIGHTS
This function is very similar to LEFTS, in that it takes the rightmost characters
from the string. The syntax is identical to that of LEFTS.
MIDS
This function allows you to take characters from the MIDdle of a string,
starting at the character that you specify. It is a very useful function and
has many applications. For example, searching through a string to ﬁnd a key
character (perhaps T h e  syntax is: MIDS (stringS, start, elements) where
start is the start character and elements is the amount of characters you wish
to extract. Figure 3 shows a very simple example.
Figure 3
AS="ABCDE"
PRINT MIDS(AS,2,3)
the result would be: BCD
Now you know how to use the main functions, we can use these functions
to help us deﬁne routines to alter strings at our leisure. Let's start with LEFTS.
If we are altering the LEFTS part of a string, we are obviously leaving alone
the RIGHTS part of the string. With this in mind, we can say that:
altered STRINGS=NEW BITS+RIGHTS (OLD STRINGS,X)
But, we do not know how many characters to change in the LEFTS, and
consequently, how many RIGHTS characters (represented by x) to put on
the end of the altered string to make it complete. For this, we need to use
another function: LEN. This returns the number of characters in a string,
referring to Figure 3 the instruction:
PIIINT LEN (AS)
would result in 5
If we can call the number of characters we want to leave intact is LEN
(STRINGS) minus N. We can put this into our program using LEFTS surgery:
altered STRINGS:NEW BITS-I-RIGHTS (OLD STRINGS,N)
But, it is a 'pain to have to state both the NEW BITS, so we obviously
need to use our friend LEN, and deﬁne N as LEN (NEW BITS). So, our
revised program looks like this:
ALTERED STRINGS=NEW BITS+RIGHTS (OLD STRINGS, (LEN (OLD
STRINGS)-LEN (NEW BITS)
Complicated isn't it? No, not really! Here is a breakdown of the ugly looking
RIGHTS function I  used. What it does is to take the original string, and
to chop o ff the LEFTS that is to be replaced by NEW BITS. The length
of the bit remaining intact (the RIGHTS) is given by subtracting the length
of the changed bit (NEW BITS) from the length of the original string.
Whew!
Now that we have struggled through that, we can actually do something
with it, and write a routine to use in our programs.
Here is a simple example of the routine and how to call it:

,

f
 you now run with GOT0200, then type PRINT LS, hey presto!, the
string L$ will have changed to DAN SAT ON THE MAT. Just a few notes
, a b o u t  the routine: You will always have to use LS and N$ for the strings
to be speciﬁed, as there is no way of creating a new function. What we are
doing is making a program that uses global variables, and there is no way
of making values of variables stay ONLY inside the routine (LOCAL) as there
is in other basics. That is the major limitation of the routine. So if, for example,
you are using the variable WS, and wished to alter it, you would need to
; m a k e  L S
For this reason, you may ﬁnd it more convenient to include line 100 as part
of the main program, instead of using it as part of the subroutine. This too
has its disadvantages, such as getting a sore ﬁnger from repeatedly typing
brackets!
The subroutine for a surgical RIGHTS is obviously going to be much the
same, but we must exchange the RIGHTS in the routine for a LEFTS, as
' i t  will be the LEFTS that we will now want to leave intact!
Here is the routine for a surgical RIGHTS

110 RETURN

The use of this routine is much the same as the one above. How simple
you cry! Doesn't it look easy? Well, yes it does, but then we discover a stumbling
block in the form of MIDS. However, with a bit of logical thought we can
overcome it.
Just as a string is composed of LEFTS and RIGHTS, it is also composed
of LEFTS, MID$ and RIGHTS. Therefore, we now get:
ALTERED STRINGS=LEFTS(OLDS,X)+NEW BITS+RIGHTS(OLDS,X)
•
As with MIDS, we can't get away with 2 parameters, N$ and L$, but
, w e  need a third, S, which is the character at which the NEWS will start being
inserted.
From that S, we can calculate all the information that we may need:
•
number of characters in L E F
• n u mb e r of characters in RIGHTS=LEN(LS)-S-LEN(NS)

is the line numbers. Since computers are very good at doing regular,
monotonous tasks, it makes sense to let the computer do the line
numbering. All you have to do then, is worry about designing your program!
Automatic line numbering is pretty easy. All we have to do is intercept
the ﬂow of Basic in the ROM after a line has been entered into the textﬁle,
or before a new line is started off - whichever way you want to look at it.
For this let me elaborate on how Commodore Basic deals with a newly entered
line.
The whole process starts at SA483, the so called Basic Warm Start routine.
This is the central point to which Basic loops back each time a line has been
entered into the textﬁle or a direct command has been executed.
This point is so important, that i t has been vectored by those clever
Commodore ROM designers. That is, instead of jumping straight to $A483,
the computer fetches the address it has to jump to from the vector at $0302.
Under normal circumstances this location which lies in RAM and can be changed
by the programmer, contains SA483 - the Basic Warm Start routine.
This will be the point where we will intercept Basic to introduce our auto
line numbering routine. More about this in a minute.
At the beginning o f the Warm Start routine, the computer goes into a
loop which waits for the user to enter a character on the keyboard. This character,
which can be anything at this point, is stored in a location, called the input
buffer ($0200). Next the computer waits for the user to enter another character,
this is stored in the following location in the input buffer, and so on until
the user presses the return key (ASCII 13). This ﬁnishes this loop and terminates
the characters in the input buffer with a zero.
Now, the computer ﬁnds out, i f the line entered has a line number in
front o f it or not. I f  it hasn't got a line number, the "statement", as it is
called, is interpreted and executed immediately as a direct command.
If the line starts with a line number, the keywords in the line are converted
into tokens and then the computer looks if a line with the same line number
is already present in the textﬁle.
If a line with that line number exists already, the old line is deleted.
Finally, the new line is inserted into the textﬁle.
If the line has nothing after the line number, nothing is inserted into the
textﬁle, thus if this line already exists it will be deleted.

Auto Line Numbering
C 6 4  P R O G R A M M I N G
To introduce auto line numbering we ﬁrst need a new command which starts
it off.
I have chosen to use the standard extended command AUTO. Note, when
testing for AUTO, the last two letters of the command will be tokenized by
the computer into $A4, since TO is a Commodore Basic function.
To produce line numbers automatically we need to know two things:
Which line number does the user want to start automatic line numbering
What step or increment does he want the line numbers to use.
AUTO therefore needs two parameters:
The line number to start with;
The increment up to the next line number.
Both parameters should be separated with a comma. I haven't bothered
to build in any error checks. If  you want to be perfect, you should know
by now how to foolproof something like this and force the computer to give
a syntax error report.
The auto routine itself starts by collecting these two parameters and saving
them into the zero page locations 251/252 (ﬁrst line number) and 253/254
(step) (lines 1640-1780).
Next we change the Warm Start vector so that it points at our routine,
instead of the usual routine in the ROM (lines 1820-1850).
Now we print a carriage return, which puts the cursor onto the beginning
of the next line (lines 1890-1900).
Now we are all set to do auto line numbering.
The overall mechanics of auto line numbering is as follows: The current
line number, contained in 2511252 is printed on the screen (lines 1990-2040).
Then it is copied into the beginning of the input buffer (lines 2080-2130).
To print the number on screen we use the normal ROM routine $BDCD,
which prints any number whose low byte is in X  and whose high byte is
in the accumulator. So that the routine can print the number onto the screen,
it naturally has to convert it into ASCII digits. It does this and stores the
ASCII digits at location $0100, terminated with a zero.
The reason why I explain all this is, that we make use of this fact when
we have to move the line number (in ASCII digits!) into the input buffer
(lines 2080-2130).
Now the computer enters the usual loop in ROM, which I have explained
above, and which waits for the user to enter a full line (line 2170). In this
routine the X-register is used for the index to the input buffer. Normally the
loop starts with X=0, but since we have already entered a line numer into
the input buffer, X contains whatever number of digits the line number consists
of. We have the correct amount in X from the loop which we used earlier
on to move the ASCII digits from location £0100 into the input buffer.
After this, we test for direct or line numbered statement (lines 2210-2280).
This is a little superﬂous here, since there is no question about a direct statement
being given at this point.
Line 2390 calls a routine in ROM which converts the line number at the
beginning of the input buffer from ASCII into the more useful low byte,'
high byte sequence and stores the result in zero page $14/15. This is used
later to search the textﬁle to see if the line number already exists.
Now all Basic keywords in the line are tokenized (line 2440).
Then the computer searches through the textﬁle to see if a line with this
number already exists (line 2450). If it does, the line is deleted (line 2500).
In lines 2540-2600 we calculate the next line number by adding the step
contained in 253./254 to the previous line number contained in 251/252.
Then there are two further ROM routines (lines 2650 and 2660) which
re-organize the Basic textﬁle and reset all the necessary pointers.
In lines 2710-2720 comes an important test which sees if there is something
after the line number.
Most of the previous code I have copied straight from the ROM. Why
this seemingly unneccessary duplication of code, you may ask?
Well, as I have already pointed out, it would be pretty annoying if we
couldn't switch auto line numbering off sine while auto line numbering is on
you can't give a direct command. Furthermore, the vectors at $0300 to $0332

having just written your latest
masterpiece, t o  'lock' the
computer so that, say, the kids
cannot spoil all your hard toils.
Before leaving your computer, i t
simply requires that you press 'f I 'and
enter any 6-digit password. Before
the computer will return back to the
language (eg BASIC), the correct
code must be entered. This idea has
been used before on expensive utility
cartridges - well now you have it at
little if no cost!
How it all works
The program is written in machine
code. Obviously, if it were written in
Basic, i t would not be compatible
with your masterpiece. I t  resides
below Basic, from $1300 to S14C1,
in the application or cartridge pro-
gram area. This means that Basic
does not have to be moved about,
but the program MAY clash with
some cartridges which uses this area
as a workspace.
When you ﬁrst use the program,
it sets up function key 'I' to call itself,
and then returns back to Basic. When
you wish to 'lock' the computer, press
The program ﬁrst deactivates the
restore key, prints up its title, and
some prompts. It does this using a
kernal call called 'PRIMM' - print
message. This works as follows:
JSR primm
.byt "Message goes here",0
(rest of program follows.)
Having called PRI M M, the coin-
•
C 128 P R O G R A M M I N G
Stop prying eyes and
itchy ﬁngers with this
handy program
puter will print out everything that
follows until it comes across a '0' byte.
Then it jumps back to your subrou-
tine. This useful message-printer
resides at 65405, SFF713.
Proglok, having printed its titles
and prompts will then ask for any
6 character code. This is implemented
by subroutine 'getcod', which inputs
6 characters, storing them in buffer
'buff'. Then the program stores the
contents into the password storage
space, 'pass'.
Next, prompts are printed (label
'rest), to  tell the user that the
computer has been locked, and that
to use it he has to enter a 6 character
password. Using 'getcod', an attempt
is entered into the buffer 'buff', and
the contents of 'buff' are compared
with the password 'pass'. I f  any
discrepancies are found, the compu-
ter jumps back to 'rest'. Otherwise,
the restore key is reactivated, and the
computer returns to the language (eg
BASIC).
Using the Program
Type in the program (see getting it
all in). Next, type the following:
SYS4864 and press return
This will intialise function key I
to read 'SYS489I' + chrS (13) as the
command 'KEY' will show.
Pressing 'ﬂ' in direct mode will
call up the program, executing a call
to address 4891. You can now enter
your keyword, using any of the keys
on the keyboard, including Line Feed
and those on the keypad at the right
of the 128. I  feel six characters
provide a fairly secure code, who
wants their computer to  be Fort
Knox?
The password having been
entered, the computer is immune to
the restore key, and can only be
accessed b y typing in your code.
When you come to want to use the
machine again, press any key and up
will come a screen asking you to enter
your code. Entering the right code
will take you into BASIC, entering
the wrong one will take you back to
the press any key screen again.
Should you forget the code, there
is a useful little trick to enable you
to recover your program. Follow the
below instructions carefully:-
1. Hold down the RUN/STOP key;
3. Press in the reset button whilst
holding RUN/STOP;
3. When the computer powers up,
you will be in the monitor. Release
RUN/ STOP now!
4. Type: X and press return.
5. You will be back i n  BASIC.
Typeing LIST and pressing return
should give you your program back.
Getting it in
The Basic loader is easy to use. Just
type it all in very carefully, and save
it to tape or disk. Then run it. I f
you've made a mistake, ?TYPING
ERROR will appear. I f  everything
is alright, you can save the code using
the following BASIC line:
BSAVE "(ﬁlename)", B15, P4864 TO
P53I3
When you want to use the pro-
gram next time, use:
BLOAD "(ﬁlename)"
SYS 4864
And then follow the instructions
under 'Using the Program...'.
And that's it...

THE USER PORT
W
be used purely for RS232 communications, but instead to form a
link between the computer and the outside world.
Despite the fact that there are twenty four lines available from the user
port, only ten are actually required to connect -
PBO-PB7, 5v, GND,
The 5v and Ground (GND) lines can usually be used to power anything
which is connected to the CM, but you must be careful not to draw more
than 100m amps because this will damage the computer.
The theory
You should already know that there are eight lines in the user port (called
PBO-PB7) which are available for the use of the individual. However, to actually
use these lines they mu st be set t o  either input o u r output (they are set t o
input on power up). Luckily, the Commodore operating system makes this
an extremely simple process. At location 56579 there is a bit for each line.
To set a line to input make the bit zero, to set a line to output the bit must
be one. (ie if you set bit 3 to one then line PB3 will be set to output). The
following example should make this easier to understand.

You can see that lines 6, 3 and 2 are going to be set to output, and lines
7, 5, 4, 1 and 0 set to input. To actually achieve this conﬁguration, the binary
number, next to the value, must be translated into decimal so that i t can
be entered into the computer, using the 'poke' statement. The necessary
calculation is as follows:
2 to the power of 6 + 2 to the power of 3 + 2 to the power of 2.
In other words 64+8+4 which equals 76. Therefore, to  achieve the
conﬁguration in the example we would have to POKE 56579,76.
Output
Now that the lines have been set, assuming some have been set to output,
it becomes necessary to have a way of controlling the state of the lines (either
low or high), which again is an extremely simple process. A  bit has been
allocated to each line at location 56577. To make a line go high you set it
to zero (i.e. i f you set bit 6 to I  then line PB6 will be taken to be high).
You must remember not to try and output through a line set to input because
this will just confuse the (764.
The following example should make this clear:
Bit no: 7  6 5 4 3 2 1 0
Value 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
As you can see, lines 6 and 2 are required to go high, leaving the other
lines low, Again, this binary ﬁgure must be translated into decimal. Using
the same process as above we discover that the ﬁgure required is 68. Therefore
the following statement must be entered:

POKE 56577, 68
To enable you to see for yourselves what effect the contents of location
56577 has on the state o f the lines, you might like to construct Circuit 1,
(refer to Figure 1 for the pin conﬁguration of the user port). The device consists
of a ULN280IA ocatal darlington driver which ampliﬁes the signal from the
user port, to light the LEDs on the lines which have been taken high (before
using the device you must enter POKE 56579, 255 to set all the lines to output).
In order to see the speed and accuracy at which the computer can control
the lines, you might like to enter Listing I. (As the program gains speed whilst
it is running, you must remember that there is only ever 1 LED lit at a time,
the reason for you seeing more than I is because the effect of the image lasts
on your retina for approximatelay I/ loth of a second.)
Input
Assuming that some of the lines have been set to input, it becomes necessary
to have a method o f reading the state of the lines. As you already know,
there is a bit allocated to each line at location 56577, so to read the lines
all you have to do is PEEK this location, remembering that i f some of the
lines have been set to output then part of this ﬁgure will correspond to output.
Because of this, and having to know which lines have been forced low by
an external device, you will have to convert the original number from decimal
to binary. The easiest way of doing this is shown below:
To use this table to convert decimal to binary, you take your decimal
number and look at the chart. Take the largest number (from the bottom
row) which is smaller than your number. You then simply repeat this process
until your number is reduced to zero, when you put a 0 by the bit numbers
which do not have a 1 by them. You now have your binary ﬁgure. Where
you see a 1 the line is high, and a 0 shows a line which is low.
For my second example circuit, I thought it might be nice to come up
with something which might be useful to other programmers. Circuit 2 gives
the necessary details to connect a numeric keypad to the C64. In order to
see what effect pressing keys on the keypad has on the state o f the lines.
you should enter Listing 2. To actually use the keypad, enter and run Listing
3 (An IRQ driven program which reads the keypad and then displays the
relevant character on the screen, because of which it will only work when
the computer is in direct mode).

•  REVIEW
Could Duncan Evans
be confucius? Not
likely, but he has

neither of them played
full-back for Liverpool.
He also runs his

Swift 24-pin printer.
Above: A rather decorative little number, don't you think?
C
all in the memory." Well I lie, he didn't really, I made that up. He
would probably have had a printer though, I mean how else are you
going to output your mind boggling philosophical doctrines unless you can
get a hard copy. Oh, it was easy enough in Confucius' day, you just ordered
the nearest monk to start scrawling on a slate and before you could say, "The
analects of Confucius", you were ﬁve generations down the line and your
life's work was being published posthumously.
Unfortunately there aren't that many monks willing to spend their lives
scrawling out my reviews for Your Commodore, and alas, very few nuns either,
so in order to support myself and my football team of starving children I
needed the hi-tech equivalent. Citizen Europe also realised that monks were
in short supply, and that they wrote as quickly as a Commodore Printer,
and thus released the 120-D, a relatively cheap 9-pin printer, This combined
low cost with decent performance and became the biggest selling 9-pin printer
in Europe.
Fair enough, but what has that to do with the price of cheese you may
ask, and quite rightly too. Well, good old Citizen, ﬂushed by the success of
the 120-D has launched something of a successor, the Swift 24, which it hopes
will swamp the 24-pin market in a similar manner to the 120-D and the 9-
pin market.
The Swift 24 offers the reasonably low price of E389 ex VAT and the
power of a 24-pin printer, plus the convenience of no dip switches. Interested?
Then read on.
Amongst the many claims made for the Swift 24 by Citizen, is one of
sturdiness, Okay, let's sec I thought, and dropped it on the ﬂoor from a foot.
Apart from the top ﬂapping around like a ﬁsh in the sea outside Sellaﬁeld,
the Swift was unperturbed by its ﬂying lesson. But then again, who has their
printed situated only a foot off the ﬂoor? I tried two feet, and was rewarded
with an unidentiﬁable piece of plastic whizzing past my ear as the shock wave
set alarm bells ringing all over North London. The printer wasn't too happy
with this treatment, and had to be calmed down and reassembled before it
was up to printing out this article. I still don't know where that piece of plastic
came from.

The Swift has a two year warranty from Citizen, as long as they don't
catch you dropping it on the ﬂoor, and the print head is guaranteed to give
you 200 million dots before dying, while the rest of the moving internals will
last approximately 4500 hours before ceasing to function. As long as you aren't
rough with it, it should last ﬁve years with ease.
There's a tractor feed and an excellent single sheet paper feeder, and the
printer is equipped with a Centronics parallel interface as standard wth a serial
RS232C as an optional extra,
Printing speed is another great claim in the advertising blurb, but at only
192 characters per second (at 12cpi) in draft mode its performance is only
average against 9-pin printers in this price range, That's the fastest it gets,
you should also take into consideration 160 CPS (at 10cpi) in draft, and more
importantly 53 CPS at 10cpi and 64 CPS at 12cpi in NLQ mode. The NLQ
fonts are presumably why you want this printer, otherwise I assure you, you
are wasting your money. An 8K buffer helps the printing process, and a snappy
little display tells you how much of the buffer is full of incoming data.
The inbuilt fonts are Times Roman (okay), Courier (very good), Helvetica
(sans serif and excellent) and Prestige Elite (horrible). There is a cut away
section of the printer where optional font cards can be plugged in to extend
the range, and of course your software may be able to create additional fonts
anyway. The dot density is 120 DPI in draft mode, and 360 DIP for NLQ
and graphics modes.
Instead of dip switches, the Swift has a two line, eight character LCD,
and eight button keypad. This can be used to alter all sorts of printer functions
including character set (from UK toJapan to Latin American), page layout
(size and lines per inch), printer emulation (Epson LQ850, IBM Proprinter
X24 and NEC P6+), font, colour or standard ribbon, pitch (proportional and
up to 20CPI), and interface options.
The control panel also allows you access to four macros, which contain
predeﬁned settings. You can redeﬁne any of these and save them into the
Swift's electronically eraseahle programmable read only memory (EEPROM),
so that when the printer is next switched on, your settings are automatically
loaded as the default.
The Citizen Swift 24 is an excellent printer, offering the power of 24-pin
printing, but with a low cost, considerable ease of use, a resilience to the
sort of damage the average can inﬂict upon it, and it's backed up by a two
year warranty. If Confucius was alive today, the Swift could have saved ﬁve
generations of monk an awful lot of hard work.

just ﬁnished a marathon typing session entering one of the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers reach for the keyboard and press
the letters R, U and N. You press RETURN, sit back and nothing happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does happen it's a
matter of spending hours searching through the program for any typing mistakes.
No matter how long you look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little but slips through unnoticed.
The Your commodore Software Service makes available all of the programs

with the software since it is all available in the relevant magazine. Should
you not have the magazine then back issues are available from the following

MEON ZONE
I
that's what all the major publishers decided a few years back anyway and
as the punters have responded with wopping the wads of green stuff on
counters all around the country, I guess they must have been right.
You can count the home format hits over the years — Gauntlet, Outrun,
Operation Wolf — just three of the titles that took the elusive number one
spot over the festive season on consecutive years, with a whole trail of others
not far behind, all riding on the back of phemoninal arcade success.
Christmas '86, Gauntlet, the ﬁrst four-player game ever in the arcades,
'87 gave us Outrun the best and most glamerous driving game at the time
and in '88 came Op Wolf the not particularly ideologically sound electronic
shooting gallery that virtually caused a world shortage of 10p pieces.
If you are an afﬁcionado of coin-ops, you'll notice that there's a signiﬁcant
time lag between a machine hitting the arcades themselves and appearing on
home formats. The reason for this is pretty obvious. Coin-op manufacturers
program and manufacture the games to an almost ﬁnished state (bear in mind
the scale of the operations here — Sega alone have a workforce of 400 engineers
working on the next Afterburner), they then offer the licence to program the
game on home formats to the various software houses.
Decisions are made, deals — whereby obscenely large amounts of money
change hands — are struck, and then the programming must begin. Yes, some
poor son-of-a-bitch has now got to get down to the brass tacks of ﬁtting
some 4 Meg extravaganza into 512, 64...or if he's done something particularly
nasty in a past life, 48K.
How the hell do you start doing that, you might ask yourself? Well, in
some cases it's quite simple. You don't. Many of the present generation of
games, particularly the Sega titles, work by throwing tonnes of hardware at
the thing, pre-shifting loadsa sprites and just (just!) blatting them up on the
screen very, very fast, And you can't do that on any affordable home machine
available today. So what do you do?
Some conversion houses take the view that if you can't do it properly,
you don't do it at all and turn such work down. Others, bear in mind that
there is a fair bit of dosh being ﬂung around for these jobs, not to mention
possible prestige, set to work on cutting the original game down like a crazed
plastic surgeon, so it can work on common home micros, after a fashion.
In the days when all that was in an arcade machine was a 6809 processor,
32K or memory and a sound chip, true coin-op conversions were possible.
Now, the coin-op hardware has accellerated away into the distance, way out
of reach of even the high end home machines, like the Amiga. What you
get now are coin-op facimalies and anyone that thinks you get the same as
the original deserves to get disappointed!
Maybe this is one of the reasons that coin-ops seem to be slightly less
prevalent this year than previously. Activision are at it the same as ever though.
Last year it was Afterburner and R-Type — this year it's Altered Beast and
a very ambitious conversion of Power Drift
Power Drift in particular is going to pose very, very signiﬁcant problems,
being a selection of blindingly fast sprite routines. Cut down the colours, take
out the scenery, is it really going to be the same kind of experience as the
original which was primarily designed to be a sit-in, throw you around, assault
you with ear shattering decibels job? I think not, Brian.
How about US Gold, who must be piqued about failing to make the hat-
trick with Thunderblade last time around? Only Capcom titles on release this
year with a creditable version of Strider hitting the streets about now and
Gouls 'n Ghosts coming in on the run up to December. There's a near perfect
version of this on the Sega Mega-Drive console, so this is certainly a possible
in the authenticity stakes, but the gameplay is a bit unspectacular and too
similar to the original Ghosts 'n Goblins that did so well for Elite way back.
But maybe the punters will be rushing back for more of the same.
Perhaps it's Ocean again who are in with the best strike at the top spot,
as Chase HQ made a good enough impression in the arcades and, although
challenging to write, is basically a driving game where you can bash into the
opposition. Got to be a contender along with Op Wolf follow up, Operation

But in the Dark Horse department, you have to consider Domark who'll
be releasing on all formats the biggie, Hard Drivin', from Atari Games. Now
this title was the ﬁrst coin-op to use ﬁlled polygon graphics (like Carrier
Command) - not counting the weird 1-Robot - and is a great game to boot.
hoot.
Due to  some dodgy programming stateside, the coin-op hasn't got a
startlingly fast frame rate and the 16 Bit version should come out about the
same, with the 8-Bits suffering but still, probably acceptable... and in trendy
3-D too, That's my tip for the top for this Chrissy, for what it's worth. But
what about next year.. .for now is the time that next years coin-op conversion
hits start making their way into the arcades.
Driving games have, again, been making the arcade operators feel warm
inside as the pennies drop noisily into the coin slots. The award for most
technically advanced has to go to Winning Run from a company called Name°.

fast. Very, very fast with some heartbreakingly beautiful touches, such as fading
the pallate of background objects up as they proceed towards you. Just like
in real life.
It's a race game par excellence as well with smart and quick opposition
plus car handling you'd normally dream about. In two modes of difﬁculty
— hard and bloody impossible — there's plenty of life in the thing, so get
yourself along to an arcade and try it out now and good luck to the guy
that has to put it on home format.
Sega is probably the single most successful arcade company. Its "I've got
a hardware expanded sprite routine and I'm going to use it" approach has
spawned many hits, along with some sophisticated sit-in units. Its  latest is
also its best — Super Monaco Grand Prix.
SMGP is also a racing game — but with a different breed compared to
something like Winning Run. If the latter were an elegant gymnast, SMGP
would be Mike Tyson. The thing impresses by sheer power of volume and
speed and is guaranteed to leave you breathless and wanting more! Can't see
the software houses turning this one down.
Capcom has come up with a new hardware conﬁguration called its CP System,
based on a couple of super custom chips that were developed in-house.
This board can obviously do great things S tr i d e r  and the newer Willow
and Dynasty Wars being three o f them — but the feeling is that the best
is yet to come.
In the beat em-up stakes, the sprites are becoming bigger and bigger —
in game such as Violence Fight and Data East's fantasy combat bash, but
nothing new beyond that.
After the success of Op Wolf, there have been many similarily inspired
games, the white knuckled Mechanised Attack from SNK, Cabal and the latest,
Dynamite Duke. The only surprising thing was that the ofﬁcial follow-up from
Tafto, the two player Operation Thunderbolt was such ﬂop. Overall, however,
89 has established that the common or garden hardware used in the everyday
PCB games has vastly outstripped the capability of the most popular home
computers.
A simple game such as SNK's Prehistoric isle has so much going on, in
so many colours, even that would he difﬁcult to undertake. The pace of
technological change — the one that spawned home computers and video games
almost simultaneously — is so fast that in coin-op terms, the machine you
bought last year, let alone ﬁve years ago, is now obsolete in arcade terms.
Which begs the question — if that is the case, what will we all be playing
in two Christmas's time? And on what machines? Enter stage left a Commodore
games console, maybe? Well, whatever, keep that joystick handy, Player One,
and give those aliens hell! Until then, i f you have been, ta very much... Kirk

Mark Evering ham is back with the
concluding part of his Introduction to
Plus/4 Machine Language
7501 Machine Language Instruction Set
The instruction set o f the 7501 processor is simply the
collection of commands which the processor can under-
stand, just like all the BASIC commands PRINT, LIST
etc. What follows is a list of commands, each three characters
long and requiring one operand. The action of the command
is shown in symbolic form, with a brief explanation and
example. A l l  the examples can be entered into the
TEDMON monitor using the method explained earlier. The
valid addressing modes are shown along with the listing
of any o f the ﬂags of the status register altered by the
command. The meaning o f  each addressing mode is
explained in the section entitled "The 7501 Addressing
Modes". The conventions below are used in the symbolic
representation of the operations. In order to conserve on
space, only short examples have been included. Many such
examples can be found in back issues of Your Commodore
or in the future FourGround articles.
- Hex digit of number " M "  - A memory/ immediate
byte
"N" -
"V" -
"A" - The Accumulator
"B" - The BRK Flag
"C" - The Carry Flag
- The Decimal Flag
"I" - Interrupt Enable Flag
"[a] — [b] - Byte/Bit move from [a] to [b]
l a ] — [b] - Byte/Bit move from [b] to [al
"[n]" - Bit n (0-7) in a byte
The Negative Flag
The Overﬂow Flag
The .X Register

The Zero Flag
ADC (Add With Carry)
Operation: A + M + C  — A,CFlags Altered: N ,Z,C ,V
Addressing Modes: ADC tt Shh A D C  Shh AD C  Shhh,X
ADC Shhh,Y ADC A D C  ($hh),Y
(Shh,X)
Function: The ADC instruction is used to add two numbers
together, using the accumulator. The operand + the setting
of the carry ﬂag (1 or 0) is added to the accumulator and
the reult is left in the accumulator. Any carry neccesary
is shifted into the carry ﬂag. I f  the result is > 127 then
the N ﬂag is set. If the result is zero, Z is set. If the result
is > +127 or < -128, the V ﬂag is set. Normally prior to
use, you should clear the carry ﬂag. The example below
calculates the sum of 16 and 48.
Example: .6000 LDA t; $10 ' L o a d  •A with value 16
CLC ' C l e a r  Carry ﬂag for addition

Function: Those bits which are both set to  I  i n  the
accumulator and in the operand are left as I in the result.
All other bits are set to zero. If the result is >127, N is
set and if the result is zero, Z is set. The example below
sets alternate bits in the byte 255 to zero.
Example: .6000 LDA S E E  ' L o a d  .A with value 255

Function: All the bits within either the accumulator or
a memory location are shifted left. Big 7 is shifted into the
carry ﬂag and Bit 0 is replaced with zero. The N and Z
ﬂags are set as for the AND instruction. Shifting a byte
left has the effect in binary of multiplying it by two. The
example below calculates 24

Example: .6000 : LDA $A5
Addressing Modes: B C S  Shhh
'Load .A with value 24
'Shift .A left (
'Shift .A left (*2)
'Return to TEDMON
Function: The BCC instruction examines the status of the
carry ﬂag and i f it is set to zero, jumps to the speciﬁed
address. Note that the address must be within -128 or +127
of the command address. This is automatically checked by
TEDMON. The below example adds two numbers and if
a carry does not occur, sotres the result on the screen.
'Load .A from addres's EA5

CLC ' C l e a r  carry ﬂag for addition

BCS (Branch If Carry Flag Set)
Operation: Branch  If C=1 Flags Altered: N o n e
The BCS does the opposite of the BCC instruction. It
tests the carry ﬂag and if it is set, jumps to the speciﬁed
address. Again, this address must be within -128 and +127
of the current address. See the example for BCC,
substituting BCS for BCC. This stores the result in the
screen memory if a carry did occur.
BEQ (Branch If Equal To Zero)
Operation: Bra n ch  If Z=I Flags Altered: N o n e
Addressing Modes: B E Q  Shhhh
F OU R  G R O U N D  •
Function: The BEQ instruction jumps to  the speciﬁed
address if the last result set the Z ﬂag because it was equal
to zero. The example below adds the value in SDO to the
value in SDI and i f the result is zero (they are both zero)
then it stores an" "symbol on the screen.
Example: MOO LDA $1)0 ' L o a d  .A with value in $DO

BIT (Test Bits In Memory)
Operation: [7] of M. — N, [6] of M - - V ,  Flags Altered:
N,Z,V A and M— Z
Addressing Modes: B I T  Shh 
B

 Shhhh
Function: The BIT instruction tests the bits of a memory
location against the value in the accumulator. Bit 7 of the
memory value is transfered to N and Bit 6 to Z. If the
result o f ANDing .A with the memory location is zero,
the Z  ﬂag is set. Neither the values in the accumulator
or in the memory location are changed. The example below
looks at the ﬁrst character on the screen and if it is reversed.
replaces it with a space.
Example: .6000 BIT SOCOO ' T e s t  bits of value on screen
BMI $6006 ' I f  character is reversed, jump

BMI (Branch On Minus)
Operation: Bra n ch  if N=1 Flags Altered: N o n e
Addressing Modes: B M I  Shhhh
Function: The BMI instruction tests the setting of the N
(minus) ﬂag and if it is set, jumps to the speciﬁed address.
The N ﬂag is set by other instructions where the resultant
byte is >  127 (bit 7 set). As for all other branches, the
destination address must be within -128 or +127 o f the
current address. The example below counts from 128 to
254 in steps of two in the accumulator.
Example: .6000 LDA $OO ' L o a d  .A with value 0
CLC ' C

ADC al $02 ' A d d  2 to accumulator

BRK 'Result < 128 - return to TEDMON
BN E (Branch If Not Equal To Zero)
Operation: Bra n ch  If Z=0 Registers Altered: None

BR K (Break Interrupt)
Operation:PC Stack, SR— Stack, I— B F l a g s  N o n e
Altered:
Function: The BRK instruction, which needs no operand
forces a Break interrupt to occur. On the Plus/4, this causes
control to  be transferred to  TEDMON. I n  fact, the
instruction jumps to the address found in $0316 like a JMP
($0316) command. The PC and SR settings before the
command may be pulled off the stack using PLA.
BVC (Branch If Overﬂow Flag Clear)
Operation: Bra n ch  If V=0 Flags Altered: N o n e
Addressing Modes: B V C  Shhhh
Function: The BVC instruction tests the status of the V
ﬂag in the status register and i f it is clear (no overﬂow
has occured), does a jump to the speciﬁed address. There
is no equivalent BVS instruction. The example loops until
Bit 6 of the value in $A3 (Clock) is set.
Example: .6000 BIT SD()
CLC (Clear Carry Flag)
Operation: 0  —C F l a g s  Altered: 
C
'Test bits of value in $DO
BVC $6000 'Overﬂow (Bit 6) clear - loop
'to $6000
BRK 'Overﬂow set - Return to TEDMON
Function: The CLC instruction which requires no operand
resets the value in the carry ﬂag of the status register to
zero. The is most useful i n preparation for an AD C
instruction. See any o f the examples using ADC for a
demonstration.
CLD (Clear Decimal Mode)
Operation: 0  —D
Flags Altered: 
D
Function: The CLD instruction resets the D  ﬂag to zero,
taking the Plus/ 4 out of decimal mode back into standard
binary arithmetic. For an explanation of the decimal mode,
see the SED instruction.
CLI (Clear Interrupt Disable Flag)
Operation: 0  —I F l a g s  Altered:
Function: The CLI instruction clears the I ﬂag and thus
enables IRQ interrupts. No other ﬂag is affected. For an
explanation of interrupts, see the relevant section.
CLV (Clear Overﬂow Flag)
Operation: 0  —V F l a g s  Altered: 
V
Function: The CLV instruction simply resets the overﬂow
ﬂag of the SR to zero. Although this is not of any use
for arithmetic operations, it can be used to produce a JMP
effect using a CLV followed by a BVC. The use of this
is that such a command can work when it is placed anywhere
in memory whereas a JMP instruction will only work in
the address for which it was intended. The example below
is equivalent to J MP $6010.
Example: .6000 CLV ' C
l
e
a
r

BVC $6010 ' B r a n c h  to $6010

#
 Shh 
S
h
h
,
X
 S h h h h
CMP C M P  C M P  C M P
Shhhh,X Shhhh,Y (Shh,X) ($ h h ),Y
Function: The CMP instruction is used to compare a value
with the accumulator in order to ﬁnd which is larger, smaller,
or if they are the same. The bits of the status ﬂag are set
thus:-
IF <  Value THEN N=1, Z=0, C=0
IF .A = Value THEN N=0, Z=1, C l
IF .A > Value THEN N=0, Z=0, C l
Combinations of these values are also possible, for instance
just testing C shows that .A is greater than or equal to
the operand value. Once the CMP instruction has been
carried out, you can test the settings of the ﬂags and perform
a branch accordingly. The example adds three to  the
accumulator until the result reaches 160.
Example: .6000 LDA # $OO ' L o a d  .A with value 0
CLC ' C l e a r  carry ﬂag for addition
DC # $03 ' A d d  value 3 to accumulator
CMP # $AO 'C o m p a r e  .A to value 160
BCC $6002 ' I f  .A < 160 jump to $6002
BRK 'value > =160 - return to TEDMON
CPX (Compare Value Against .X)
Operation: N o  Effect F l a g s  Altered: N , Z , C
Addressing C P X  # Shh C P X  Shh C P X  Shhhh
Modes:
Function: The CPX instruction performs an identical
operation to CMP except that the comparison takes place
between the .X register and the speciﬁed operand value.
The settings of the ﬂags are identical to those for CMP.
CPY (Compare Value Against .Y)
Operation: N o  Effect F l a g s  Altered: N , Z , C
Addressing C P Y  # Shh C P Y  Shh C P Y  Shhhh
Modes:
Function: The CPY instruction performs an identical
operation to CMP except that the comparison takes place
between the .3/ register and the speciﬁed operand value.
The settings of the ﬂags are identical to those for CMP.
DEC (Decrement Memory)
Operation: M - I  — M F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Addressing DEC D E C  SIth,X D E C  Shhhh D E C
Modes: S h h  
S

X
Function: The DEC instruction is used to decrease the value
stored in a memory location by 1, as if you had subtracted
one from it. The result of the decrement is stored back
in the source location. If the value is decremented past zero
it becomes 255. The N ﬂag is set i f the result is >  127,
and the Z ﬂag set if the result after the decrement is zero.
The instruction does not set the carry ﬂag like ADC and
SRC. The example below decreases the border colour until
it becomes black (value 0).

BR K 'R e su l t = 0 - Return to TEDMON
DEX (Decrement .X)
Operation: X - I  — X F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function. The value currently in the .X register is decreased
by one and returned to the X register. As for DEC, if the
result goes below zero, it becomes 255. The N and Z ﬂags
are set in the same way as by the DEC command. The
example below uses the DEX instructions to provide short
pause in the running of a program.
Example: .6000 LOX 0  ' L o a d  w i t h  initial value 0
DEX ' D e c r e m e n t  value in .X
BNE $6002 ' I f  result<>0 jump to $6002
BR K 'R e tu r n  = 0 - return to TEDMON
DEY (Decrement .Y)
Operation: Y - 1  — Y F l a g s  Altered: N , X
Function: The DEY instruction performs an identical action
to DEX except that it operates on the Y. index register.
The example program for DEX will work equally well if
LOX and DEX are replaced by LDY and DEY. Settings
of ﬂags are as for DEX.
(EOR (Perform Exclusive-Or On Accumulator)
Operation: 
A
 EOR M A  Fl a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: Those bits that are set to  one in either the
accumulator or the speciﬁed operand are set to one. Those
bits which are both zero in accumulator and operand are
set to  zero. Those bits which are set to  one i n  both
accumulator and operand are set to zero. The resultant
byte is left in the accumulator. l i th e  result is > 127, N
is set, and if the result is zero, Z is set. The EOR instruction
has the effect of toggling bits in a byte.
INC (INcrement Memory)

AddressingINC I N C  Shh,X I N C  Shhhh I N C
Modes: $ h h

tation is stored back in the source location. If the value
is incremented past 255, it returns to zero. The N ﬂag is
set i f the result is > 127, and the Z ﬂag i f the result is
zero. The example below increments the border colour until
it goes past 255 back to 0 (black).
Example: .6000 INC SET19 'Increment border colour in
SEEN
BNE $6000 ' I f  result<>0 jump to $6000
BR K 'Result =0 - return to TEDM ON
INX (INcrement .X)
Operation: X + I  — X F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: The INX instruction performs the same operation
as INC except that it increments the .X register rather than
a memory location. The operation and ﬂag settings other
than this are identical to  INC. The example below
YOUR COMMODORE
increments the
reaches 192.
Example: .6000

BNE $6000 ' I f  .X < >192 jump to $6000
BRK ' . X  = 192 - return to TEDMON
JMP (Jump To Location)
Operation: M  — PC F l a g s  Altered: N o n e
Function: The JMP instruction is used to change program
ﬂow to  a  speciﬁed address, like the BASIC GOTO
command. None of the ﬂag or register settings are changed.
The jump is unconditional and is not limited to the -128,
+127 range imposed on branch instructions. The example
below just jumps back to itself for ever!
Example: .6000 JMP $6000 'Jump unconditionally to
to $6000
JSR (Jump To Sub-Routine)
Operation: P C  +2—Stack, M— PC F l a g s  N o n e
Altered:
Addressing Modes: J S R  Shhhh
Function: The JSR instruction is equivalent to the GOSUB
command in BASIC. First the address to which control
must return after the sub-routine is pushed onto the stack,
and then a jump is carried out to the speciﬁed absolute
address. When a subsequent RTS is found, the return
address is pulled back off the stack and jumped to. The
example below calls a short routine to increment the border
volour, then ends.
Example: .6000 JSR $6004

LDA Stih,X
LDA Shhhh,Y
Function: The LDA instruction is used to transfer a value
to the accumulator. The speciﬁed operand value is loaded
into the accumulator. The N ﬂag is set if the value is >127,
and Z is set if the value is zero. The source value is not
affected. For examples, see any of the example programs
using the instruction.

Modes:

Function: The LSR instruction performs the opposite of
the ASL instruction. All the bits within the accumulator
or memory location are shifted to the right. Bit 0 falls out
into the carry ﬂag, and bit 7 is replaced with zero. This
has the effect of dividing a number by two with the binary
carry bit being left in the carry ﬂag. The example below
calculates 192/8.

Function: The NOP instruction simply does nothing -  it
does not affect any register or ﬂag, and creates a time delay
of 2 clock cycles. The instruction is often used either to
give a space between sections of a program or to replace
other instructions airing debugging.
ORA (Perform Logical OR)

Function: Al l  the bits which are set to  zero in both
accumulator and operand byte are set to zero. All bits which
are set to one in either or both of the accumulator and
operand are set to one. The result is left in the accumulator.
The N and Z ﬂags are set as for the AND instruction.
The exampole below sets bit 7 of the character at the start
of the screen, so reversing it.

PHA (Push Accumulator Onto Stack)
Operation: A  -  Stack F l a g s  Altered: N o n e
Function: The PHA instruction is used to push the value
currently in the accumulator onto the machine stack. Once
there, it can be pulled back into the accumulator using PLA.
For information on the stack, see the relevant section. The
example below uses a push and then pull to set up the
status register ﬂags.
Example: .6000 PHA

BRL
PHP (Push Processor Status Reigster Onto Stack)
Operation: S R  -  Stack Fl a g s Altered: N o n e
Function: The PHP instruction does the same as the PHA
instruction except that it is the status register which is pushed
onto the stack rather than the accumulator. This is useful
for two purposes: retaining the status register when calling
a sub-routine and examining the status register by pushing
PHP and pulling PLA.
PLA (Pull Accumulator From Stack)
Operation: S ta c k  -  A F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: The PLA instruction pulls a value off the stack
into the accumulator previously pushed on using the PHA
instruction. The N and Z ﬂags are set in accordance with
the manner for the LDA instruction. For an example, see
PHA.
ROL (Rotate Left)
Operation: C  - [7 O l -  C
Addressing R O L
Modes:
ROL
Shhhh,X
'Push value in accumulator onto
'Pull value back of stack & set ﬂags

Flags Altered: N,Z,C
ROL Shh R OL  R O L
Shh,X S h h h h
Function: Bit 7 of the accumulator or memory location
is shifted into the carry ﬂag. Bits 6 through I are shifted
left one bit, and the carry ﬂag before the operation is shifted
into bit O. The result is left either in the accumulator or
in the memory location speciﬁed. I f  the result is 1 2 7 ,
N is set and i f the result is zero, Z is set. The example
below uses ROL and ASL to multiply a I6-bit number
by two. The low byte (Shhi.,L) is stored in SDO and the
high byte (SHHI I) in SDI.
Example: .6000 ASL WO ' S h i f t  low byte in SDi left (*2)

ROR (Rotate Right)
Operation: C -  [7 0 ] -  C F l a g s  Altered: N,Z,C
Function: The ROR command does the opposite of ROL.
Bit 0 is shifted into the carry ﬂag. Bits 6 through I are
shifted right one bit, and bit 7 is replaced by the carry
ﬂag prior to the operation. This can be used in conjunction
with LSR to perform two-byte division by two. The example
below divides the 16-bit value in $DO (low) and SDI (high)
by two.

RTI (Return From Interrupt)
Operation: Slack—'SR, Stack —PC F l a g s  A l  I
Altered:
Addressing Modes: Imp l i e d
Function: The RTI instruction is used like RTS but to
return control to the main program after an interrupt has
been serviced. It is usually not used on the Plus/4 as the
Plus/4's own interrupt handler is normally used. For more
information, see the section on interrupts.
SEC (Set Carry Flag)
Operation: I  — C F l a g s  Altered:
Function: The SEC instruction simply sets the carry ﬂag
in the status register to  one. This is mostly used as
preparation for the SBC instruction which requires the ﬂag
to be set before subtraction. See SBC for an example of
its use.
SED (Set Decimal Mode)
Operation
Function: The SED instruction puts the 7501 processor
in your Plus/4 into its decimal emulation or BCD (Binary
Coded Decimal) mode. Normally, numbers are represented
in binary, 8 bits holding a number up to 255. In decimal
mode, each byte hold a number between 0 and 99. The
numbers are represented by two hex digits: $99 is 99 decimal,
S23 is 23 decimal and $67 is 67 decimal, digits over $9
not being allowed. The mode is of limited use. The only
time I have used it myself is for an on-screen clock in my
OOPS! program to be printe din "Your Commodore" in
the future. All the arithmetic (ADC and SBC) instructions
work while in decimal mode. The example below uses
decimal mode to add 23 and 54 togdther, giving a BCD
result.
Example: .6000 SED ' E n

SEI (Set Interrupt Disable Flag)
Operation: I  — I F l a g s  Altered:
Function: The SEI instrucvtion disables all IRQ interrupts
by setting the interrupt disable ﬂag in the status register.
For a full discussion, see the section on interrupts.
TAX (Transfer Accumulator to .X)
Operation: A  — X  F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: The TAX instruction simply moves the value in
the accumulator into the .X index register. The command
also sets the N and Z registers accordinglyu, as if a LDA
instruction had been performed. The example below pulls
a value off the stack and transfers it to the .X register.
This is useful as there are no PLX, PLY instructions.

Example: .6000 PLA 'Pull byte off stack into accumulator
TAX ' T r a n s f e r  value into .X
BRK ' R

TAY (Transfer Accumulator to .Y)
Operation: A  — Y F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: The TAY instruction works in exactly the same
way as the TAX instruction, transferring the value in ther
accumulator into the .X register and setting the N and Z
ﬂags as for LDA. See TAX for an equivalent example.
TSX (Transfer Stack Pointer to .X)
Operation: S P  — X F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: As mentioned in the section on the stack, the
pushing and pulling values on the stack is handled by an
index register, the stack pointer (SP). The value in the stack
pointer may be transferred into . X  using the TSX
instruction. This provides an alternative means of accessing
the stack, not needing the accumulator. The example below
pushes a value onto the stack and then retrieves it in ,Y
without using the accumulator.
Example: .6000 PHA
TSX
INX
LDY $0100,X
TXS
BRL
'Push accumulator onto stack
'Transfer SP to .X register
'Increment .X register
'Pull .Y from stack area
'Restore new SP setting
'Return to TEDMON
TXA (Transfer.X To Accumulator)
Operation: X  — AFlags N , Z
Altered:
Function: TXA works just like TAX except here the value
stored in .X is transfered to the accumulator instead o f
vice-versa. This can be especially useful when you want
to store the value in .X on the stack temporarily. The
example below shows this,
Example: .6000 TXA 'Transfer value in .X to accumulator

BRK ' R

 to TEDMON
TSX (Transfer .X To Stack Pointer)
Operation: 
X
 — SP F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: As the reverse of TSX, the value in the .X index
register is transferred to the stack pointer. This insruction
should be used with care as incorrect setting of the stack
pointer can cause a program to crash. For an example of
correct use, see TSX,
TYA (Transfer T o  Accumulator)
Operation: 
Y
 — A F l a g s  Altered: N , Z
Function: The TYA works just like TAX and TAY except
that the value i n  the .1' register is transferred to  the
accumulator. For an applicable example, see TAX and
TAY.
7501 Addressing Modes
Most of the 7501 instructions just covered require a number
as their operand. However, this number can take many
forms, all of which lead to a simple byte-long number. The
way in which this ﬁnal number is speciﬁed is called an
addressing mode. In all operations except stores and jumps,
YOUR COMMODORE

e

e

•  FOUR G R O U N D
the actual number is the contents of the address speciﬁed
and not the address itself.
Implied Mode. With implied mode, no operand is
speciﬁed. In a command like TXA or PHA, the location
of the data byte is implied by the command. Also, commands
like ASL or ROL can be used implied because omitting
the operand chooses the accumulator as the data location.
Immediate Mode [  % h ] .  In  immediate mode, you
specify the byte number directly rather than as an address.
Absolute Mode [Shhhh]. In absolute mode, you simply
specify an address of a memory location in the range 0-
65535. The byte operand is then deﬁned as the contents
of the location you have speciﬁed.
Zero Page Mode [Shia Zero page mode is identical
to abs3lute mode except that the address you specify can
only be between 0 and 255. The advantage of using this
mode is that it is faster, and because the operand is 8-
bit instead of 16-bit, the command takes up one byte less
than when using absolute mode,
Relative Mode. Relative mode is that used for all branch
instructions. The idea is that instead o f  specifying an
absolute address, you provide an offset which is added to
the current address to ﬁnd the destination. The programmer
never has to worry about how this offset is calculated as
TEDMON does the calculation for you.
Indirect Mode [(Shhh)]. Indirect mode can only be used
by one command, the JMP instruction. The 7501 looks
at the absolute address you specify, and gets its jump address
from there. The ﬁnal address is stored with low byte (Shh LL)
at the location speciﬁed, and the high byte (SH 1-14) at
the tleAt location on.
Absolute Indexed Mode [Shhhh,X/Thhhh,1]. Absolute
indexed mode calculates the address from which to get a
byte by adding the value stored in the index register you
specify to the base address. Thus if .X is set to 3 4 ,  LDA
$1200,X would get a byte from the address $1234.
Zero Page Indexed Mode [Shh,X/Shh,Y1. Zero Page
indexed addressing is the same as absolute indexed except
that the base address can be between 0 and 255 instead
of 0 and 65535. The advantage is speed and compactness,
Indirect Indexed Mode [(Shh),Y1. Indirect indexed
mode, sometimes called post-index indcrect mode is a little
more complex. The address Shh is a zero page address (0-
255). The base address is found in Shh (low byte) and Shh+ I
(high byte). From then on, the mode works like absolute
indexed mode. Shhhh,Y with Shhhh being the address found
at Shh in zero page. The .1' register is added to the address
to give the ﬁnal address.
Indexed Indirect Mode Ohh,X)]. Indexed indirect
mode, sometimes called pre-indexed indirect mode is.a little
strange. The address location is calculated thus: The zero
page address Shh is added to the value in .X. A base address
is then loaded from the zero page address Shh+X, and this
forms the ﬁnal 16-bit address. The mode seems of limited
value, and I have never myself seen a program on any 7501-
type processor using the mode!
Plus/4 R O M/ R A M Paging Considera-
tions For Data Transfer
Most computers, such as the BBC Micro have only one
memory map. That is to say that RAM extends from $0000-
$7FFFT and R OM  from $8000-$EFFF. The Plus/ 4
however is more ﬂexible than that. It has RAM from $0000-
$71;FF, but the area from $8000 onwards can either be
RAM or ROM, giving the computer a full 64K of RAM.
You can choose to have ROM at $8000- by doing a STA
$FF3E, and ROM by doing a STA SFF3F. A l I LDA,
JSR etc. operations work on the current type of memory,
ROM or RAM. Note that when using RAM at $8000
onwards, you must disable interrupts ﬁrst. The two
programs below would appear at ﬁrst to do the same thing,
but the ﬁrst loads the accumulator with a byte from ROM
and the second from RAM, by using the STA instructions
to page RAM or ROM in.

LDA $8000
STA SET3E

BRK
Program 2: S E I

The simple method o f choosing between ROM and
RAM conﬁgurations makes the Plus 4 far more powerful
than standard single memory map computers.
An Introduction To Plus/4 7501
Interrupts
Interrupts seem to frighten many people, but are really
nothing to fear. Interrupts are just what they sound like
interrupts! You can program your Plus/ 4 so that whenever
a speciﬁc event occurs, it interrupts the main program which
is running, and says "Hang on a minute, I'm sorry to
interrupt but I've got something important to do now so
you'll have to wait until I've ﬁnished." Your program, called
the interrupt handler can then do whatever it wants, then
it returns control back to the main program which continues
running as if nothing had happened.
There are several different events which can be used
to generate interrupts, but here we will c
simplest, what are called raster interrupts. Normally,
interrupts are used on the Plus/ 4 to keep the system clock
read by TI and TIS running. Every time the screen on your
TV or monitor is redrawn, an interrupt is generated. This
occurs every 50th of a second in the UK. When this interrupt
is generated, a JMP instruction is done: i M P  ($0314),
$0314 being a "vector" containing the address at which
an interrupt handler can be found. Then, a routine in the
ROM of your Plus/ 4 updates the clock, scans the keyboard
and does miscellaneous other work. This means that you
can get your own program to run at the same time as Basic,
by changing the address stored in $0314. The program below
sets up interrupts so that every 50th of a second, the border
colour is incremented.
'Disable interrupts for setup

called by eXiting to Basic and doing a SYS DEC ("6000')
to enable the routine (equivalent to G$6000). From then
on, everything works normally, but the border colour
changes colour rapidly. This is how the program works.
The ﬁrst section just changes the address at S031440315
to point to our program at %ND. When you change this
address, you should always stop interrupts ﬁrst, and re-
enable them when you're done. The interrupt handler
routine now in action ﬁrst saves the SR on the stack. Any
routine used as an interrupt handler must preserve the
contents of all the registers so they should be pushed into
the stack and then restored at the end of the routine, hence
the PLP. Control is then returned to the ROM by a .IMP
SCEOE into the ROM interrupt handler. This allows the
ROM's routine to work, to keep the keyboard active and
to update the clock.
And that's really all there is to it! Obviously, there are
many ways in which interrupts can be used other than this
simple demonstration, and the scope of the subject is really
beyond this magazine, but once you grasp the basic

Bibliography And Final Word...
I hope from this short series I have given you an appetising
taste of machine code and a foundation knowledge. We
have only covered the simpler aspects of machine language
programming due to lack of space, and you will probably
ﬁnd this course most useful accompanied by a few reference
books. The books I  used to  write the introduction to
machine-code, and which I would recommend are:

us your news, views and
groans
Dear YC
I feel that I must write and express my views.
I purchased a CI6 in 1984 and enjoyed the scope of this machine so much
that the following year I  bought a Plis14, and am still impressed by its
capabilities.
However, things might have been different i f I had known at the time
that both of these machines were only a stop-gap until the C128 and Amiga
werer developed more.
Although I am satisﬁed with the Plus14, the software manufacturers appear
not to be, support for the machine has been poor. It is picking up slowly
now but the demand will never be as great as for the C64, because it lacks
the numbers game.
So, why not help all those CI6 and Plus/4 owners and compile a C16-
Plus/ 4 edition of Your Commodore, you already have the material to hand,
so why not re-cycle and up-date a selection of articles from the last ﬁve years'
magazines. -Your range of material must be vast, therefore this edition would
appeal to all levels of operators.
Perhaps if you did run such an edition, you might inﬂuence some software
manufacturers to think again - not such a bad idea!!
K. Williams, Gt. Yarmouth, Nolrolk
I agree wholeheartedly with you. The Plus/4 is a very much underrated machine.
However, you cannot simply just produce a one o ff magazine like this
every so often. In fact, we have already published the Your Commodore CI6
and Plus/4 essential guide', back in 1988. On top o f this, we have to date
got no less than 5 disks o f Plus/4 software available through our Readers
Services department. The fact of the matter is this, like any other commodity,
computers and computer software rely on supply and demand. t h i n k  that
the following will clearly show what I mean.
Al the moment, I  have 154 readers submissions awaiting publication. This
ﬁgure can be broken down as follows:
C64 = 141: C128 4 :  Amiga = 1: Plus/4 = 8. (C'est la vie).

Dear YC
Could you, through your letters pages, please help me solve one of life's great
mysteries.
I have been searching this fair land of ours for some 18 months now,
for a  copy of the instruction manual for the Currah Speech Cartridge.
Unfortunately, my efforts have proved fruitless. I  am turning to you as a
last resort. Could you please publish my plea for any help in this matter.
Thank you.
Ken Cole, 33 Ramsfort House, Roseherry Street, London SE16 3NZ
Thanks for the letter. Here goes...
Come on now you lot out there, someone must be able to help our Ken.
Any help would be must appreciated. Please send all replies direct to Ken
and not to Your Commodore. Thank you.
Dear YC
The reason for this letter is simple. I am a dedicated C16-Plus14 user. Therefore,
I have started a C16-Plus14 club. The club intends to produce a monthly
magazine which will include Program listings, Tips, Hints, Pokes and Reviews.
If there are any C16-Plus14 owners that would like to join the club, they
can write to me at the address below for details. I  would like to add that
any C16-Plus14 users can join, no mater what age, sex, level of competance
you are,
R. Robinson, 112 Cliff Road, Hornsea, North Humberside, HUI8 LIE.
Thanks for your letter. Ills nice to see that someone is actually doing something
positive for a change. Good luck with the venture.
Dear YC
I was interested to read your review article about the LC-IOC colour printer.
I purchased one about a month ago. On arrival, a small part of the membrane
key system was dented, which was of course no matter to the control or print
output. But after 3-4 colour printouts, two hex dumps in colour, then 8-9
test ones (in Black), in NLQ, the NLQ faded to below draft quality! I therefore
phoned Star and spoke to someone that sounded like a young girl assistant.
I do not think she understood what I explained to her. I later spoke to someone
that appeared to be more technicallay minded. We both agreed that the ribbon
should last for more than trhose few printouts at NLQ. this was at 11:30
in the morning. At 11:45 the next morning a replacement colour ribbon arrived
by post. How's that for excellent after sales service?? (11 out of 10 to Star).
I wrote back with my thanks, and the following suggestions:
/. The clear part of the plastic cover should be removable in addition to the
rest of the plastic cover. This lets one see the print as it is made.
2. As far as I know, only fanfold paper can be scrolled back by the printer,
to the top of the page. Single sheets do not obey the command. It should
be made possible for single sheets.
3. I found out that if one pulls the release lever to one then 'backs' the single
sheet with the ﬁrst sheet of fanfold paper, then the command for the printer
to return both the single sheet together with the ﬁrst sheet of the fanfold
paper does work. The fanfold sheet is the ﬁrst of several sheets of the fanfold
stack. The purpose of all this??? One can print in more detailed graphics to
pin detail.
J. Bradley, Lanarkshire, Scotland.
Thank you for your comments regarding the review. Ihave tried your suggestion
regarding the scrolling and it does appear to work just ﬁne. Thanks for the
tips.

Cry for help
Dear 128 Corner,
I wonder i f you or any of your readers can help me. When using my 128
in CP/ M mode I am unable to display the Pound sterling sign on either the
Screen or the printer.
On pressing the POUND key I get a Hash sign (#  ) displayed instead.
Just as if I had pressed the Hash key.
If you can solve this problem it would make life easier for me as at the
moment when in CP/ M I have to type Pounds sterling.
I use a Wordprocessor called VDE13 which I obtained from the Public
domain, (I am writing this with it) which I  think is very good, but would
be even better if I could use the POUND sign.
I would also like to know if it is possible to change the Character colour
from purple on booting CP/ M. Can I change the colour from within a proﬁle.sub
ﬁle, as I have put this ﬁle on my CP/ M boot disk so as to ask me the Date
and time on booting CP/ M.
Your Commodore is a brilliant Mag for Commodore users and the 128
Corner is a great idea, its encouraged me to write to you, and I hope you
are able to keep it going.
Steve Travis,
Barnsley
After much experimenting in the ofﬁce I'm afraid that we've come up with
a blank regarding your pound sign. You can alter the keymap using the KEY DEF
program that is on your system disk to alter the code that any key on the
keyboard prints. Al l  we can suggest is that you change the character code
that is assigned to the pond key to the same code that your printer expects
for this character. You may ﬁnd that the character does not appear as a pound
on the screen, chances are it will be a back slash, but as long as your printer
is set up to print a pound you should have no problems. See your printer
manual for details on the code to use for a pound sign.
The same program KEY DEF can be used to set the screen colours upon
boot up. Don't make changes to the system disk supplied with your Cl28,
make them on a copy o f it. KEY DEF
with it so you should have no problems using it.
If anyone knows o f a better way to allow Mr Travis to have a pound
sign please let us know.
Glad to hear that you like the mag and Cl28 Corner. Remember keep
writing in with any tips, hits, views on software and general queries and we'll
do our best to keep this page both topical and informative.
Video Memory Expansion
Dear 128 Corner,
In the July issue o f Your Commodore you mentioned the video memory
expansion from ESSL that brings the video memory of the VDC up to 64
K and you said that you don't know an order company that sells such an
expansion.
There is a company in Switzerland that sells such an expansion and also
a special Basic that supports the new memory. With this Basic you will be
able to reach a resolution of 700,020 pixels.
The program is called Graphic Booster and it is available with the memory
expansion for the C128113 in the plastic case and without the expansion for
the C 128 D  in the metal case. Contact Combo AG, Tugginerweg 3, CH-
4500 Solothurn, Switzerland.

Is g o o d  to see that Your Commodore reaches parts that other computer
mags cannot reach!
Thanks for the info on the Swedish company, other readers may wish
to contact them directly at the address quoted. I  have writte to the company
myself and will let you know through these pages about prices and any other
Cl28 goodies that they may have available as soon as I get a reply.

18 into 8 won't go
Dear 128 Corner,
have just read your article C128 Corner in the recent edition o f Your
Commodore, and must congratulate you upon taking the initiative to set up
a regular page for C128 users.
I have been a Commodore fan for a number of years, and earlier this
year decided to upgrade from the old faithful CM which had served its purpose
well but was stretched to its limits. Although the Amiga and PC clones looked
very attractive, the initial outlay fo r both hardware and software was
prohibitive!! so the C128D was bought, and CM sold, the prospect of wider
horizons for myself, and lots of old C M software to keep the kids happy.
Then the bubble burst w h e re  was all the software and support for this
machine o h  dear I've bought a dud!!! etc etc.
However 1 can now say how pleased I  am with the Cl28D, with real
wordprocessing courtesy of Superscript, and a machine which can offer the
budding programmer 2 processors to play with. I  have progressed now to
the stage of writing small Z80 routines in 128 mode and transfering them
over into CP/ M, and feel that the opportunities for learning are once agaain
wide open. OK my pals with the PC clones can still boast massive memories,
terriﬁc speeds, and huge cost for software!!, but many admit when having
seen the Cl28 in action that its presentation and results are virtually as good,
but the Cl28 is far more versatile and offers the learner far more scope.
Is it beyond the bounds of possibility for an MS DOS emulator to be
constructed with the Z80, or is it exclusive to the 16 bit machines??. I have
looked at a few MS DOS books for hints on how the system is put together
but all that I can ﬁnd is user instructions.., no nitty gritty!!. Does anyone
have any thoughts on this???
I have tried CP/ M software from Digital which has been written for a
Rainbow computer but the 1571 is unable to read the discs, should I be looking
at modifying the disk parameter table or am I expecting the impossible here??,
any hints??
I will certainly do my best to keep the comments ﬂowing in to l u p p a r t - - -
Cl28 corner, and I  hope many of my fellow C128—u
Well done to YOUR CO

 you're a Cl28 fan M r  Allan. Here at this ofﬁce we still
think that much o f the software written for the Cl28 is far superior to that
written for the 16-bit machines like the PC or Amiga. I f  you're into using
CP1 M why not get writing in with tips and articles as I'm sure that CP1
M is an ability of the Cl28 that most users never use.
I'm afraid that MSDOS is designed for 16-bit computers Itot 8-bit Itk i
