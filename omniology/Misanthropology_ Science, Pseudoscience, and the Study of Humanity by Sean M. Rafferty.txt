MISANTHROPOLOGY
Misanthropology: Science, Pseudoscience, and the Study of Humanity introduces 
students to key concepts in critical thinking across the four core branches of 
anthropology: cultural, linguistic, biological, and archaeological. It combines 
a critical analysis of anthropology as a field with current concepts in scientific 
skepticism.
By deconstructing a range of global case studies in which anthropological 
research runs aground, the book teaches students to distinguish between legitimate 
science and pseudoscience. It covers key concepts in critical thinking and rigorous 
research, such as cognitive biases and logical fallacies, data collection and consensus, 
probabilistic thinking, as well as political, nationalist, racist biases. Students learn 
not only how to apply these concepts to anthropological research and fieldwork, 
but also to their consumption of everyday information.
This book will appeal to anthropology students and will be particularly useful 
for instructors of introductory anthropology courses, as well as instructors of 
courses across the humanities and social sciences focused on inculcating critical 
thinking skills.

BIAS AND FALLACY IN   
ANTHROPOLOGY AND BEYOND
The Demarcation Problem in Anthropology
Science has always faced what Karl Popper termed “the demarcation problem” 
(Popper 1999): what is the distinction between scientific and unscientific inquiry? 
How does one reliably tell science from nonscience, the fact-​based from the fan­
ciful? This problem became more pressing since the latter twentieth century as 
postmodernist philosophy became more popular in the academy, questioning the 
idea of truth and facts themselves. For Popper, the answer was simple, if strict. For 
something to be scientific, it must be falsifiable. To know if something might be 
right, it must be at least possible to prove it wrong. Ideas that are not disproven 
live to fight another day, and those that live the longest become the theories and 
laws of science. Ideas that cannot be falsified belong to the realm of pseudoscience.
While simple, or perhaps because of it, Popper’s demarcation is misleading. 
In fact, there is no simple, clear demarcation between science and nonscience 
(Reisch 1998:335–​336). It is also true that what is considered nonscience one day 
may become science, if supporting facts are discovered (Pigliucci 2010). Science 
is a complex, fractious, and constantly evolving social endeavor that defies the 
easy and simple characterizations that people tend to prefer. But in the end, given 
adequate time, science is based on a consensus regarding facts.
Anthropology faces unique problems in terms of the demarcation problem. 
For one, anthropology in the American tradition includes four subfields: cultural 
anthropology, biological anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics. These four 
fields use very different evidentiary standards, ranging from idealist to empiricist. 
Within any one anthropology department you are likely to see very hard science 
of the sort Popper would have warmed up to, and also more interpretative analyses 
that would have likely caused him to wrinkle his nose and cringe.

What, then, do these disparate fields share in terms of scientific rigor, given the 
huge range in of their respective subject matter? Is there a demarcation line that 
separates all of anthropology from nonscience, from pseudoscience? The answer 
happily is yes, and it is simply that all anthropology is evidence based. True, some 
aspects of the subfields are more fundamentally based in empirical evidence than 
others. The work of the ethnographer is more qualitative than that of the paleo­
anthropologist. But even for those subfields where there is a significant element of 
interpretation, those interpretations are still based on and constrained by physical 
evidence. And interpretations are always provisional, pending possible refutation 
by contradictory evidence.
Pseudoscience, by comparison, is scornful of evidence. The pseudoscientist 
reaches a preferred conclusion in advance, then selects evidence, often removed 
from any relevant context, to lend supposed support for their conclusion. Often 
the preconceived conclusion is one that justifies some closely held identity or 
ideology. Contradictory evidence is waved away or ignored, and as a last resort, 
one can always claim some conspiracy to keep pseudoscientific ideas suppressed. 
Pseudosciences exploit the relatively poor scientific literacy of the general public, 
providing sensational but baseless interpretations that may “feel good to think” but 
which leave the thinker mentally impoverished.
Pseudoscience has always played a problematic role in shaping the public dis­
course on science, but modern media, particularly cable TV, the internet, and social 
media, have elevated the problem to alarming levels (Harrison 2017; Schiele 2020). 
While the diversification of television channels in the 1980s was initially promising, 
with numerous production companies creating educational content, competition for 
viewers and advertisers spurred a race to the bottom. As noted by Schiele (2020:4):
The role played by [media] producers, who are rarely aware of the current 
state of science, should under no circumstances be minimized: they allocate 
airtime, judge relevance and, therefore, grant visibility, all the while filtering, 
formatting and adapting statements according to the norms of media dis­
course, including success and profitability criteria.
The abandonment of the “fairness doctrine” that mandated that television 
programs provide all sides of a debate exacerbated the path do dominance of 
pseudoscientific narratives of the nation’s airwaves. Education gave way to “edu­
tainment” as sensationalism and drama outperformed facts and theories in the 
hunt for advertising dollars. A viewer would be hard pressed to find much legit­
imate science programing on TV today, and it is not uncommon to find rank 
pseudoscience masquerading as educational content.
The explosion of online content has accelerated this trend. Now every type 
of pseudoscience can have its own home on the web, with each providing its 
own self-​reinforcing echo chamber. The internet provides the ideal technology for 
reinforcing bias and enabling the selecting of only the information that supports

the preferred narrative. Freedom of information online is a net good, but the cost 
is that much of that information is unrefereed, distorted, misleading, or simply 
wrong. The modern twist of the old “if it bleeds it leads” maxim might be “bull­
shit gets clicks” and the unfortunate truth is that pro-​science, skeptical content is 
often overshadowed by a virtual ocean of nonsense. The intellectual battleground 
of today is online, and scientists are starting with a significant disadvantage. Most 
scientists prefer not to fight at all. Public engagement by scientists is a notoriously 
rarity (Stilgoe et al. 2014), even when the public is willing to engage, let alone 
when it is actively resistant to science’s gifts.
Science itself, or rather, the scientists that practice it, are not blameless. In one 
sense we live in a golden age of science popularization, with a growing skep­
tical movement online, a wide choice of excellent online and conventional print 
venues for science with a public focus, and even a few examples of high quality, 
pro-​science television. However, my own experiences in academia, skepticism, and 
public outreach tell me most academics choose not to engage with pseudoscience. 
In their defense, there are some compelling arguments on their side. Some fear 
engaging with pseudoscientists lends false credibility to their specious arguments, 
for example.
Many scientists are also concerned about the likelihood that their time might 
be “wasted” when confronting pseudoscience, since you can’t really use rational 
arguments to dissuade someone from a position they didn’t arrive at through logic 
in the first place. Thomas Paine (1995) in 1776 wrote “To argue with a man who 
has renounced the use and authority of reason … is like administering medi­
cine to the dead”. The scientist, and the pseudoscientist, view the world based on 
incompatible premises, making any real understanding between the two unlikely 
or impossible. Also, those who have studied the psychology of pseudoscience 
might have legitimate concerns about a “backfire effect” (Nyhan and Reifler 
2010) where criticizing counterfactual ideas can actually reinforce those ideas, 
especially if those ideas are of great significance to a person’s identity and/​or 
ideology. To have any hope of success in such interactions takes specific training 
and skills, which most of us lack.
When Bill Nye, “The Science Guy”, chose to debate noted creationist Ken 
Ham, many scientists and science educators criticized him for essentially giving 
free publicity and unwarranted attention to “the other side” (Schulson 2014). 
I felt the same way until I heard Nye’s response (Nye 2014). Essentially, he has 
since argued that vast majority of those who have since viewed the debate online 
are neither scientists, nor ardent creationists, but simply interested people who 
are probably genuinely curious about the issues in question and don’t have any 
other sources of information. In essence, he argues that in fighting the committed 
pseudoscientist, you’re not fighting against them so much as for the minds of those 
witnessing the argument.
Finally, there are pragmatic concerns that I suspect hold many academics 
back from fighting against pseudoscience. Engaging with the public, and with

pseudoscientists especially, takes time, energy, and resources, and relatively few aca­
demic institutions sufficiently reward their scientists for doing so. Administrations 
at some institutions may even look at such efforts as a waste of time, and not factor 
such efforts into promotion or tenure decisions. This leaves the task mostly to 
those of us who are relatively late in our careers, with sufficient job security to take 
on the potentially thankless task their junior counterparts cannot afford to. This 
is surely disheartening for researchers, especially those new to the avocation, and 
reduces the desire to engage in public outreach in general if for no other reason 
than professional self-​preservation.
However sensible avoiding public engagement may seem in the short term, 
I argue that this attitude is ultimately self-​defeating. Science is ultimately 
supported by public money and by private industry. The bulk of private science 
funding goes into research and development toward saleable products or services, 
and while market forces operate to keep this research on track to creating func­
tional, science-​based products, it also tends to leave little room for funding that is 
open-​ended—​“pure” research without an immediate, practical outcome. General 
research of that sort tends to be far more dependent on public funding dispensed 
through government institutions. But that funding is ultimately controlled by 
the public through their elected representatives. Their understanding of science 
matters to us, or at least it should.
When anti-​intellectualism and pseudoscience is allowed to take roots, and 
scientists do little to speak out or intervene, they shoot themselves in their meta­
phorical foot. I would argue that all scientists, or for that matter all academics and 
educators, have a moral and ethical duty to speak out against, expose, and actively 
combat, pseudoscience in all its myriad forms. But for those in the academy less 
convinced by abstract, moral arguments, know that in fighting against pseudo­
science, you are also fighting for science, for rational inquiry, and quite possibly, 
for your livelihood.
Goals of this Book
In writing this volume I had two major goals. First, I want to provide a reader with a 
representative array of pseudoscientific ideas that are, at their core, anthropological. 
Most attention in this area has been focused on the subfield of archaeology, and 
there are several excellent, comprehensive texts that cover “pseudoarchaeology” 
in all its glory. Feder’s Frauds, Myths and Mysteries (2018) remains the standard text 
for this topic. There has been less attention to the other subfields of anthropology, 
though each has been afflicted with their own pseudoscientific interpretations. So, 
in the chapters that follow, I try to give a selection of what I have found to be the 
most significant pseudoscientific hypotheses for anthropological data. I have tried 
to include both the absurd, ideas that no reasonable anthropologist would enter­
tain, but also ideas which have gained a foothold in the discipline despite their lack 
of plausibility and evidentiary support.

Second, I am hoping to convince the reader that skepticism and critical 
thinking should have a home in anthropology. In the past, critical thinking has 
typically featured as a listed priority in the general education curricula of most 
colleges and universities. However, it has most often been taught in relation to 
the canon of specific fields or academic departments. Psychology majors learn to 
think critically about claims regarding psychology, history majors learn skepticism 
regarding historic documents, and so forth. Exposure to the ideas of generalized 
critical thinking, of how to recognize any pseudoscience, not just that relevant to 
one’s chosen profession, has largely been limited to philosophy programs. This is 
not to denigrate these general efforts, or philosophy specifically, but I do think that 
in today’s world it is no longer sufficient.
College students increasingly will go on to careers that are not directly related 
to their undergraduate majors. Preparing them to apply critical concepts pri­
marily of relevance to areas in which they will not spend the major of their 
careers does little good. Attempts to instill general critical thinking skills within 
the siloed structure of the modern university are more often lip-​service efforts, 
as already overworked faculty lack the time, energy, and resources to do so, not to 
mention the relevant skill sets. Most professors would say their class teaches critical 
thinking, but relatively few have likely thought explicitly about what that means, 
or what the general applications of thinking critically outside of class might be.
For this reason, I have been teaching critical thinking and skepticism classes 
within an anthropology department. The classes are explicitly designed to teach 
core concepts in critical thinking that are universally applicable, but many of the 
examples are drawn from anthropological data. Anthropology makes an ideal 
setting for teaching critical thinking skills and skeptical concepts. Many diverse 
concepts are involved in skepticism, ranging from neurology, psychology, culture, 
society, and elements of the natural sciences. Anthropology’s holistic, interdiscip­
linary approach to the study of humanity ideally disposes it to the discussion 
of skepticism, to a greater degree than other social sciences. Anthropology in its 
coverage includes neurological and psychological concepts significant to skepti­
cism. Also included is the underlying framework of evolutionary theory that can 
explain how those neuropsychological elements came to be. Anthropology, how­
ever, also focuses on the key idea of culture, about how human beliefs and ideolo­
gies affect the way we perceive and relate to the world around us.
My own training and research have been in the field of archaeology. Some 
might reasonably question why is a book on skepticism in anthropology being 
written by someone whose background is so focused on the material elements of 
humanity? Somewhat to my own surprise I have found that my background as 
an archaeologist provided ideal training for presenting skepticism and debunking 
pseudoscience. Archaeology is “privileged” among the subfields by being com­
monly subjected to pseudoscientific interpretations. So, many archaeologists must 
learn basic skeptical and critical thinking concepts, if only as a matter of discip­
linary self-​defense.

In the chapters that follow I will present prominent, pseudoscientific inter­
pretations specific to each of the subfields of anthropology. Some of these baseless 
explanations may be well known to the reader. Other specious interpretations are 
likely less familiar. For each pseudoscientific example, I not only present the scien­
tific counterarguments, but also present them in the context of skeptical concepts. 
For example, many anthropological pseudosciences are ultimately based on cog­
nitive biases, errors of cognition or perception, or logical fallacies. In this, I hope 
to point not just how these ideas are wrong, but also why, and in doing so, present 
broad concepts that are of use beyond anthropology.
My goal is to use case studies to build an argument for how one can reliably 
discern science from nonscience. I make it a point to tell every class I teach that 
it probably won’t matter much a few years after graduation if they remember the 
specifics of the course material, for example, the dates of archaeological cultures 
or sites, or the types of artifacts associated with them. However, it will matter very 
much whether or not they have learned to discern a valid explanation of some­
thing from an invalid explanation. It is my primary goal, I say, to teach them to 
be “good consumers of information”, regardless of whether that information is a 
scientific theory, a sales pitch, or a political message.
We can define a series of characteristics that a scientific explanation should 
embody. None of these is necessarily a pass/​fail for the science/​nonscience test, 
but taken in total, they build a case for the acceptability of an argument or even an 
entire field of inquiry. These include the following principles.
Science should be testable. For something to be science, it should be possible 
to apply some sort of test. Explanations must hold up under scrutiny. This is not as 
simple as it sounds, however. Some explanations lend themselves to experimental 
verification. Early physicists such as Robert Boyle or Isaac Newton hypothesized 
the presence of a “luminiferous aether”, a basic medium through with all objects 
in the universe moved. However, repeated scientific experiments failed to show 
the presence of such a medium, and Einstein’s theory of special relativity later 
proved mathematically that it could not exist. The theory, long accepted, even­
tually failed the test, and was falsified. Some fringe researchers still cling to the 
notion, but they are not practicing science, they are pseudoscientists.
However, some explanations do not lend themselves to experimental falsifi­
cation in such a straightforward manner. Modern string theory, which holds that 
all matter in the universe is composed of vibrating strings so small they defy any 
possibility of direct observation, by its very nature resists experimental verification. 
Some physicists thus argue that string theory is a pseudoscience, but most do not. 
What seems to be untestable today could someday be verified or falsified. Current 
lack of testability does not in itself disqualify an explanation from scientific status, 
though it does relegate it to something of a scientific purgatory while appropriate 
testing methods are developed.
Archaeology has a problem in this regard. The phenomena it studies exist only 
in the past, and so cannot be directly observed. We are left with the physical

residues of past activities to draw our conclusions of what actually happened and 
why, like a detective combing through clues at a crime scene. But those residues 
are always incomplete due to the vagaries of deposition and the ravages of time. 
The data is often equivocal, lending itself to support more than one explanation. 
Archaeology is not alone in this constraint; much the same can be said of paleon­
tology for example. This does not make archaeology or paleontology unscientific, 
however, it simply means that there is unlikely to be a single “acid test” for any one 
archaeological explanation. Instead, archaeologists must build a supporting case 
for their explanations based on a preponderance of evidence. Explanations that 
explain the preponderance of existing evidence are deemed scientifically plausible. 
Explanations that, over time, are found to be at odds with most of the available 
data must be discarded.
Scientific explanations should be plausible. A scientific explanation should fit 
with what we already know about a subject. No explanation exists in a vacuum 
but is presented to be compared with a wide range of existing explanations and 
general understandings within the relevant field. Ideas and explanations that are 
glaringly out of place in comparison to what we already know should be viewed 
with extreme skepticism.
As with testability, lack of immediate plausibility does not absolutely rule out 
an explanation as being scientific. The concept of plate tectonics contradicted all 
accepted geologic understanding when it was first proposed by a small number 
of scientists in the early twentieth century and was therefore generally rejected 
as implausible. It didn’t help that one major proponent of the hypothesis, Alfred 
Wegener, was not a geologist but instead a meteorologist. Later geologic discov­
eries, particular that of mid-​oceanic ridges, would eventually refute orthodoxy 
and establish plate tectonics as a fundamental of modern geology.
Plausibility, however, should still be seen as a hugely desirable trait in any scien­
tific explanation. Plate tectonics was an anomaly, and such seismic paradigm shifts 
in what is acceptable as science are rare in the extreme (Kuhn 1962). Most scien­
tific work builds incrementally on what we already know, adding one more piece 
to an emerging puzzle, rather than throwing out all the pieces in favor of a new 
pattern. We shall see as we get to case studies that many pseudoscientists refer to 
such rare occasions to support their own unscientific explanations. “Wegener was 
proved right, so my ideas must be right as well”. This is a fallacy and ignores the 
fact that Wegener and others were eventually proved right through adherence to 
the scientific process, not its avoidance. Perhaps the most important aspect of the 
scientific process is its self-​checking nature.
Nonscientists often find the ways scientists evaluate their ideas harsh and 
uncompromising. That is no misapprehension: it is harsh and uncompromising, 
and it must be so. Any scientific proposal must pass a rigorous and extensive period 
of probation where one’s peers try their best to falsify that proposal, and generally 
poke holes in one’s logic. There can be no lessening of the critique out of con­
cern for one’s feelings or one’s position. Only those ideas that pass this criticism

are worthy of being admitted to scientific cannon. Most ideas are rejected, some­
times soon after their proposal, sometimes long after as new, refuting evidence 
is uncovered. This is how science checks itself. It is arguably the most important 
aspect of science and a key factor in distinguishing science from nonscience.
A protocol has developed in science through which new ideas are subjected 
to this cross-​examination. A scientist who develops a novel interpretation of some 
phenomenon generally submits their findings to a professional journal. The most 
prestigious journals are peer-​reviewed, meaning every paper submitted must be 
evaluated and approved by a generally anonymous and independent group of 
scientists with relevant expertise. Most papers are rejected or require extensive 
revisions. Peer-​reviewed journals with the broadest readership and most general 
subject matter, such as Science or Nature, are generally the most prestigious, and 
therefore the most selective in their publication criteria. There is a wide variety of 
more specific, less widely read journals in any science that are still well-​regarded 
peer-​reviewed publications. At the lowest end of the scale are journals that are not 
peer-​reviewed at all, journals managed by industries or organizations with vested 
interests in the published subject, or even predatory journals that will publish 
nearly anything for an exorbitant fee.
The self-​checking nature of science does not end at publication. In fact, most 
published scientific studies are eventually proven to be flawed or simply wrong, 
and in extreme cases are retracted by the publishing journal, literally stricken from 
the public record.
Any researcher who attempts to circumvent the self-​checking process must be 
viewed with grave criticism. For example, it is not uncommon for high-​profile 
research projects to have press releases sent out in conjunction with journal pub­
lication. However, there have been some notorious examples where scientists 
have gone public to the press, making sensationalist claims, prior to any real peer 
review of their ideas. The “cold fusion” fiasco of 1989 is a prime example. Martin 
Fleischman and Stanley Pons first presented the results of their research at a press 
conference prior to even submitting their results for peer review. Upon further 
evaluation, Pons and Fleischman’s research methods were found to be highly 
problematic, their supposed results have never been replicated, and the entire field 
of inquiry has now been totally discredited. Such a flagrant avoidance of the self-​
checking mechanism of science has become the poster child of pseudoscience. 
pre-publication press conferences or self-​publication are red flags of bad science. 
Internet publication is today the mainstay of the pseudoscientist, where anyone 
with a web-​domain can publicize their ideas free of any pesky expert oversight or 
independent evaluation.
Science should follow the parsimony principle. More commonly known as 
“Occam’s Razor”, the parsimony principle states that, when multiple explanations 
of the same phenomenon are in competition, the explanation that requires the 
fewest prior assumptions is most likely correct. I chose to use the term “parsimony

principle” as opposed to “Occam’s Razor” because the later term has become 
distorted over time. Occam’s Razor is now often explained as favoring the sim­
plest explanation, because “simple” is an easier concept to express than “parsi­
mony”. This is a distortion because simple explanations are not always the same as 
parsimonious explanations.
Science is not authority or personality based. In science, it’s the process, not the 
person. To be sure, a given researcher’s background, level of education, expertise 
in a given field, and so forth, are factors that must be taken into account in 
considering the validity of their claims. But by themselves, these factor do not 
ensure that validity. Just because someone is an expert does not mean they’re right. 
This is especially true when scientists offer interpretations in areas outside of their 
expertise. The classic example in this regard is Linus Pauling. Pauling is a leading 
father of modern chemistry and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 for 
his work on chemical bonds. He was also the only person to win two Nobel 
prizes in unrelated fields, with his later antinuclear political activism winning him 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962. Few scientists could match Pauling’s professional 
prestige and authority in his time. Regrettably, later in life Pauling became a major 
proponent of megadosing vitamin C as a treatment for a range of ailments ranging 
from the common cold to cancer (Pauling 1970). Megadosing vitamin therapy 
can be most favorably described as highly controversial, relegated to sham medi­
cine and quackery, though its practice survives in the “complementary and alter­
nate medicine” (aka “CAM”) community today. Pauling’s scientific authority lent 
credibility to vitamin therapy, even though repeated scientific trials have shown it 
to be no better than a placebo and can result in serious illness such as kidney dis­
ease. To most, a Nobel Prize, let alone two, is enough to justify heeding a scientist’s 
arguments uncritically, ignoring the fact that nearly all modern scientists’ actual 
region of expertise is narrow and highly focused. The farther one strays from that 
focus, the less their opinions are worth, regardless of stature within their field.
Science, for all its safeguards, is still a human practice. Even the most objective-​
minded scientist still has their share of personal biases and preconceptions. What 
is significant is that science and good scientists recognize this and take systematic 
steps to account for and neutralize these biases as much as possible.
Key Concepts in Skepticism
Before we set out to engage with pseudoscience in anthropology, we need to 
devote attention to basic concepts that apply to skeptical thinking. The modern 
skeptical movement is large and diverse, including members and content from 
across academia and also the general public. I shall not attempt to be compre­
hensive but will refer the reader to more detailed work, both current and seminal 
(Novella et al. 2018; Sagan 1995). Instead, I will focus on fundamental concepts 
that will recur throughout the text.

Cognitive Biases
Thinking is hard work. I don’t mean that metaphorically; the brain is among the 
most energy hungry organs in the body, and complex cognition is one of its most 
taxing processes. Rational thinking also takes time to evaluate data and come to 
a reasoned conclusion. Humans evolved in conditions where the maintenance of 
a strict energy budget was a major concern. If you are not entirely sure where 
your next meal is coming from, it makes evolutionary sense to expend the energy 
you have as efficiently as possible. Also, we evolved in conditions that selected for 
rapidity in decision making. Very often it wasn’t possible to take time to weigh 
the evidence; a hungry lion isn’t going to wait. These factors favored the evolu­
tion of a range of cognitive heuristics, or shortcuts that allowed our ancestors to 
make a good decision most of time. Acting efficiently and quickly likely provided 
a greater selective advantage than acting rationally and correctly. We call these 
heuristics today “cognitive biases”.
Cognitive biases, while they may have conferred a selective advantage during 
the evolution of our species, have become increasingly problematic as humanity 
has grown in population and sociocultural complexity. While an error rooted in 
a cognitive bias in the past had most of its effect on the individual or local level, 
today entire social institutions involving countless people might be based on erro­
neous thinking rooted in cognitive biases. Shortcuts in thinking that may have 
saved lives in the forests and plains of Africa a hundred thousand years ago can ruin 
or cost lives in the classrooms, political offices, board rooms, or emergency rooms 
of the modern world.
Probably the most pervasive and pernicious of cognitive biases is “confirm­
ation bias”. This is the tendency to only register facts that confirm one’s existing 
opinion, ideology, or social norms. Information that might contradict one’s 
opinions aren’t rejected so much as they never register in the first place. This can 
be banal, such as noticing a hyperactive child’s recent consumption of a sugary 
treat, but not noticing the same behavior in the absence of a treat or the times 
the child consumed the treat in relative peace and quiet. But it can equally be 
hugely damaging, such as when authorities notice antisocial or criminal behavior 
on the part of minorities, reifying personal and institutional racism, when the 
same behavior is explained away for whites if it is even mentioned at all. If you 
are only trying to prove what you already want or suspect to be true, you aren’t 
doing science.
A scientific example of the effect of confirmation bias in anthropology can be 
found from the early years of paleoanthropology, and one of the most famous, if not 
the most of famous scientific hoaxes: the Piltdown Man skull (Figure 1.1). When 
the skull of a seeming primitive hominin was “discovered” by Charles Dawson 
in 1912, there was compelling reason to suspect it to be a forgery. Dawson, a 
lawyer and an amateur paleontologist, was already suspected to have forged other

11
discoveries. When he allegedly discovered additional specimens of “Eoanthropous 
dawsinii” (Dawson’s Dawn Man), he obstinately refused to reveal the location of 
their discovery. And while many scientists of the time accepted the specimen as 
legitimate, enough questioned its authenticity to warrant much greater general 
skepticism. As it happened, the skull was not conclusively proven a fake for over 
40 years.
Why did Piltdown fool so many experts for so long? A large part of the answer 
is confirmation bias. Part of this was due to then current hypotheses regarding 
early human adaptations, and part of it is due to nationalism, if not racism. When 
Piltdown was first made public, the scientific consensus on African human origins 
had yet to be formed. Major finds from Africa lay in the future, most notably the 
Taung Australopithecus africanus specimen, discovered by Raymond Dart in 1924, 
12 years after Piltdown. Adult specimens of Australopithecus were not discovered 
until 1937. The most famous hominin specimens known in 1912 originated in 
Asia and Europe. The type specimen of Homo erectus was discovered in Java in 
1891, while the first Neanderthal specimens were discovered in 1856 in Germany 
and in France in 1908.
All these specimens could be described as relatively large-​brained, but having 
primitive, ape-​like facial profiles, and those became the expected characteristics 
of our early human ancestors. The “missing link” would be a large-​brained ape, 
and Piltdown appeared to be just that…the specimen “confirmed” existing sci­
entific “bias” toward one particular narrative. It fit in what Feder (2018:67) terms 
the “large-​brained paradigm”. Since it fit with what many expected to find, it 
was not subjected to the degree of critical evaluation that may have convinced 
more people of its inauthenticity. In fact, the erroneous consensus established in 
part by Piltdown contributed to an unwarranted degree of skepticism for finds 
from Africa. Legitimate human ancestors from Africa were questioned since they 
were small-​brained, close to the range of brain sizes for living apes, and not at all 
what was expected at the time. It was only when so many of these small-​brained, 
African hominins had been discovered that the weight of scientific evidence over­
came confirmation bias.
This degree of confirmation bias, based on predictions of scientists working 
from partial data early in the development of a field, is to some degree excus­
able. But less intellectually laudable concerns were also at play with Piltdown. 
Tension and conflict between European powers was at an unprecedented 
level in 1912, only two years prior to the start of World War I. Evidence of 
early humans from France and Germany no doubt galled the British sense of 
nationalism, and Piltdown seemed to provide a British equivalent, and one 
seemingly ancestral to later forms. Evidence from Asia and Africa, by com­
parison, was at best evidence of dead ends or degenerate forms, not part of the 
human story, which at that point in history was still largely viewed as a white, 
European story. So not only did Piltdown seem to fit with existing scientific 
 

12  Bias and Fallacy in Anthropology and Beyond
12
12
expectations, it also reinforced nationalistic and racist ideologies of the time. 
Feder (2018:81) notes:
The lesson of Piltdown is clear…It shows quite clearly that scientists, though 
striving to be objective observers and explainers of the world around them, 
are, in the end, human. Many accepted the Piltdown evidence because they 
wished to-​it supported a preferred view of human evolution, with a time 
depth and least the equal and perhaps even greater than that of other nations.
Paleoanthropologist Isabelle de Groote further summarizes the role of confirm­
ation bias in the Piltdown Man case:
Piltdown Man sets a good example of the need for us to take a step back 
and look at the evidence for what it is and not for whether it conforms to 
our preconceived ideas.

Similar to confirmation bias is the habit of “cherry-​picking” information. While 
confirmation bias is largely passive, in that one only notices evidence that confirms 
expectation, cherry-​picking is the active selection of data that supports one’s pre­
conceived opinion and willfully ignoring contradictory evidence. Confusingly, 
one may not necessarily be aware that one is cherry-​picking. The significant dis­
tinction is that confirmation bias is selectively accepting the arguments of others, 
while with cherry-​picking one is selectively accepting specific data when for­
mulating one’s own argument. Putting this in a common context, a politician 
cherry picks information to create a political argument; their constituents engage 
in confirmation bias when they accept that argument since it supports a particular 
political ideology.
Archaeological arguments have been particularly susceptible to cherry-​picking. 
I suspect this has much to do with the fragmentary nature of the archaeological 
record, and the necessary degree of subjectivity in interpreting archaeological 
data. In paleoanthropology, the number of specimens, especially for early periods 
of human development, are sufficiently limited that one can’t simply ignore any 
of them, even if one’s intellectual opinion of them may differ from another’s. 
With archaeological data there is typically a lot more to consider, even if it is 
fragmentary and not necessarily fully representative of the original population. 
Accordingly, it is easier to consciously or unconsciously select only the data that 
supports a given interpretation, rather than letting the data drive conclusions. 
Arnold (1990:475) noted:
Archaeology lends itself particularly well to intentional misinterpretations…
Prehistory is particularly vulnerable to manipulation because it so often 
depends on a minimum of data and a maximum of interpretation.
A good example of this possibility, and how even a famous and superbly cre­
dentialed researcher can descend into pseudoscience, can be found in attempts 
to assess human antiquity in the New World. The age of human presence in the 
Americas has been a contentious issue since Europeans first arrived in the New 
World. The Age of Exploration predated the Enlightenment, and the dominant 
explanatory paradigms of the age were drawn from religious scripture or classical 
philosophy. Yet neither the Bible nor Aristotle contained any explicit material that 
could be applied to the question of Native American origins. While some thinkers 
of the day did arrive essentially at a viable explanation, most notably José de 
Acosta (2008), who speculated that Native Americans must have originated in Asia 
(Mann 2006:143), most assumed Natives to be some remnant of a pre-​Adam and 
Eve population, or some later population of Old World refugees. Either option 
wrote Native Americans out of the history of the New World.
Even as speculation gave way to scientific inquiry during the eighteenth 
and nineteenth centuries, the most common archaeological interpretations of 
Native American history was that it was short and recent. Native Americans were 
 
 
 
 

14  Bias and Fallacy in Anthropology and Beyond

not thought to have been in the New World for very long, again minimizing 
their role in history. A common belief during the nineteenth century was that 
Native Americans had in fact replaced an earlier, more civilized population, the 
builders of the numerous earthen monuments of the Midwest and Southeast. The 
“Moundbuilders” were commonly portrayed as early migrants from Old World, 
later exterminated by savage Indians. Even while people of learning, most notably 
Thomas Jefferson, argued that the physical evidence argued against such a scen­
ario, it remained popular and can still be found among pseudoscientists (Milner 
2005). Even noted archaeologists of the early twentieth century, particularly Aleš 
Hrdlička (1926), argued for a very recent and short Native American past.
This all changed beginning in 1933, when Edgar Howard’s Southwest Early 
Man Project discovered human artifacts directly associated with the remains of 
extinct, Ice Age mammals in New Mexico (Bouldurian and Cotter 1999). Clearly 
humans had been in the New World for many millennia, the question was how 
many. The development of radiocarbon dating in the 1960s finally gave a solid 
answer: at least 10,000 years. Excavations of Paleoindian sites through the 1970s, 
and the accumulation of a range of absolute dates, seemed to provide a clear origin. 
The earliest of the Paleoindian sites, associated with distinctive “Clovis” spear 
points, dated no earlier than approximately 11,500 years ago. And for decades, that 
was the consensus on human antiquity in the Americas.
This consensus came under scrutiny starting in the 1970s with the discovery 
of sites that produced evidence of human activity and radiocarbon dates that 
preceded the accepted dates for the Clovis “culture”. All these sites came under 
strong scrutiny, as should be the case when new data seems to undermine a 
widely held scientific consensus. Many of these “Pre-​Clovis” sites were eventually 
discredited, due to artifacts having been naturally transported into older sediments, 
or inaccurate radiocarbon dates. However, sites such as Meadowcroft Rockshelter 
in Pennsylvania, (Adovasio et al. 1978), Cactus Hill in Virginia (McAvoy 2000), 
and Monte Verde in Chile (Dillehay and Collins 1988), have withstood repeated 
criticisms. Today, a new consensus is emerging that acknowledges that, while 
Paleoindians were likely the first large and widespread human population in the 
Americas, there were numerous earlier migrations and migratory routes. And 
there are still some (e.g., Fiedel 2017) who maintain what many North American 
archaeologists say is an obsolete “Clovis first” view, largely again through confirm­
ation bias.
This was the scientific context in which, in 1963, Louis Leakey first presented 
data from the Calico site in the Mojave Desert of California (Leakey et al. 1968). 
Louis Leaky was, at the time, not only one of the most famous anthropologists, 
but one of the most internationally recognized scientists—​period. Through the 
1950s and 1960s Leakey and his wife Mary directed paleoanthropological research 
in Oldovai Gorge in East Africa. Fossils of what would come to be known as 
Paranthrpous boisei and Homo hablius would fill in key sections the human evolu­
tionary bush and confirm Africa as the site of early human development. Leakey

15
also was instrumental in the early careers of several primatologists, including Diane 
Fossey, Birute Galdikas, and Jane Goodall.
Leakey had been informed of a possible early site in California by local 
archaeologists, and in 1963 commenced excavations at what came to be known 
as the Calico Early Man site using funds provided by the National Geographic 
Society. Leakey had already claimed that linguistic diversity indicated a very long 
human history in the Americas, and the excavation produced what he claimed 
were human artifacts of at least 100,000 years in age. This date wildly exceeded 
any claim made for even supposedly pre-​Clovis sites and Leakey’s interpretations 
were immediately subject to criticism (e.g., Haynes 1973). The stone artifacts 
in question only superficially resembled actual artifacts, and the site contained 
numerous “geofacts”, naturally broken stones that resembled artificial objects but 
that were created by natural breakage. He was essentially guilty of cherry-​picking 
data, selecting only those few geofacts that most resembled tools, and confirmed 
his preferred hypothesis, and discarding the much greater number of objects that 
were obviously natural. That Leakey was not trained as an archaeologist, and had 
no familiarity with New World archaeological cultures, did not help his case. He 
was viewed as acting out of the same sort of professional hubris as Linus Pauling. 
Leakey’s interpretations were roundly rejected, and his professional reputation 
never fully recovered prior to his death in 1972.
This pattern of cherry-​picking data to support claims of early human presence 
in the Americas has continued after Leakey’s misadventure. Archaeologists working 
at the Pedra Furada rock-​shelter site in Brazil have claimed to have identified 
human-​made artifacts in deposits at least 30,000 years old, and perhaps as old 
as 60,000 years, again greatly exceeding that of the most widely supported pre-​
Clovis sites (Guidon and Delibrias 1986). And again, the most likely explanation is 
that the archaeologists in question are cherry-​picking only those natural rocks that 
most resemble human artifacts and ignoring the vast majority that do not. James 
Adovasio, David Meltzer, and Thomas Dillehay, all supporters of a pre-​Clovis col­
onization of the Americas, have dismissed the “artifacts” from Pedra Furada as 
probable geofacts in much the same manner as the critique of the Calico site 
(Meltzer et al. 1994).
The same sort of cherry-​picking logic that led researchers astray at Calico 
and at Pedra Furada has likely played a role at a more recently identified site, 
the Cerutti site in California (Holen et al. 2017). Cerutti contains the remains 
of Mastodon carcasses, with bone breakage the researchers argue can only have 
been the result of human agency. Also found at the site are cobbles, which the 
researchers argue are tools used to break the aforementioned bones. And, the 
site dates to over 100,000 years ago, again much earlier than the most expansive 
estimates of human colonization of North America. Unfortunately missing from 
the Cerutti assemblage is any concrete evidence of human activity: no tools, no 
soil features, nothing that would constitute incontrovertible evidence of human 
presence at the site. Again, the likelihood that the researchers are cherry-​picking 
 
 
 
 
 

16  Bias and Fallacy in Anthropology and Beyond
16
16
the specimens whose breakage looks most like a human-​induced breakage and 
indulging in confirmation bias toward a much greater human antiquity in the 
Americas than the archaeological consensus is far greater than the likelihood of 
their arguments being true. Again, this has been pointed out by numerous critics 
(e.g., Haynes 2017).
Confirmation bias and cherry-​picking highlight our tendency to interpret evi­
dence in ways that maintain a preferred narrative, particularly if that narrative 
is integral to our personal or group identity. In general, people do not reach 
conclusions by rationally interrogating the available evidence. Instead, evidence is 
slotted into a preexisting narrative. A narrative that was based around the super­
iority of European cultures was so integral to the personal identities of many 
early twentieth-​century academics that Piltdown was not subjected to critical 
evaluation despite obvious warning signs. Leakey’s personal sense of identity as 
the premier paleoanthropologist of the day prevented him from seeing the degree 
to which he had left the rational world of science behind. Ideas that confirm 
our narratives and identities are those we cling to most desperately and reject 
any attempt to refute. Cognitive biases are universal and pernicious, since they 
are part of the human “source code”. The best we can do is to be aware of their 
existence and depend on rigorous adherence to the scientific method to weed out 
conclusions reached due to bias, not fact.
Logical Fallacies
The human brain is the most powerful tool for rational cognition that we know 
of. It is ironic then that logical thought is a skill that must be learned, and people 
tend to make numerous errors in logical thought that weaken or invalidate their 
conclusions. We call these errors collectively “logical fallacies”. Logical fallacies 
come in two categories: formal and informal. Committing a formal fallacy irrep­
arably invalidates an argument. However, formal fallacies are rarely encountered 
outside of the boundaries of discussions regarding formal logic and syllogisms. An 
informal logical fallacy weakens an argument, and makes for a poor foundation, 
but does not by itself completely invalidate an argument. There are numerous 
taxonomies of informal logical fallacies, published online and in print (McRaney 
2012; Novella et al. 2018). Here I will limit discussion to the most prevalent 
informal logical fallacies that show up in pseudoscientific arguments regarding 
anthropological topics.
Probably the simplest and most common informal logical fallacy is the 
assumption of causation based solely on correlation. This happens when one 
assumes that, because two events co-​occur, or follow sequentially, that one must 
cause the other. This happens in large part due to the human ability to recognize 
patterns. We exhibit, as described by Shermer (2011), “hyperactive pattern recog­
nition”. Humans are so good at recognizing patterns that we tend to “recognize” 
patterns in randomness. This is what in statistical terms is a “type one error” or 
 
 
 
 
 

Bias and Fallacy in Anthropology and Beyond  17

17
a “false positive”. In evolutionary terms, type one errors tend to be selected for 
over type two errors, or false negatives. It is safer to conclude that the noise at the 
mouth of the cave is a monster and stay inside, than to think it’s nothing and find 
out it’s a bear.
Humans evolved to be so good at recognizing patterns in the natural world 
that now we often tend to imagine connections and patterns where none exist. In 
extreme cases people deny the possibility of coincidence entirely, leading to con­
spiratorial ideology and paranoia. Building on our discussion of cognitive biases, 
we are especially prone to identifying spurious correlations when they seem to 
reaffirm what we already think to be true.
One relevant example of confusing correlation with causation in the history of 
anthropology can be found in early interpretations of ancient hominin archaeo­
logical sites. In the middle of the twentieth century, a series of finds from South 
African caves promised to revolutionize our understanding of human evolution. 
Not only did these caves contain the remains of hominins, primarily Australopithecus 
africanus, they also contained the bones of potential prey animals. This correlation, 
or as archaeologists would say, association, led many anthropologists to assume a 
causative relationship between the hominin bones and the animal bones. Clearly 
this was evidence of our early ancestors engaging in hunting. Chief among the 
proponents of this “Killer Ape Hypothesis” was Raymond Dart.
Dart and his colleagues faced one significant explanatory hurdle in proposing 
these South African Australopithecine finds as evidence of early hominin hunting. 
There was a suspicious absence of obvious stone tools at the sites—​no stone flakes, 
no cores of raw material, no manufacturing debris, no indication of, if these were 
hunters, how they were getting the job done. This led Dart to propose what he 
called an “osteodontokeratic” (Dart 1957) technology, one based purely on tools 
of animal bone, teeth, and horn, which existed as a precursor to stone tools. This 
hypothesis, while not totally implausible, faced two problems: first, none of the 
animal bones at these sites bore unequivocal signs of modification or use wear, and 
two, a hypothetical technology based on tools that show no signs of ever being 
used would be unfalsifiable. Still, Dart enthusiastically supported the idea, which 
became tied in with the developing “Man the Hunter” theory of human origins 
(Lee and DeVore 1968). In this theory, male hunting practices were seen as para­
mount in human evolutionary development. All defining human traits: bipedalism, 
tools use, language, sociality, large brains, can all be explained as facilitating male 
hunting. Females were reduced to evolutionary nonentities.
There are, of course, numerous problems with the Man the Hunter model, 
ignoring female roles in sociality and food procurement chief among them. But 
for the purposes of our discussion of logical fallacies, researchers made an error 
regarding the archaeology of the early hominin sites that were so fundamental to 
the model. While it was true that prey animal bones and hominin remains were 
correlated at these sites, this correlation was largely spurious. Many of these sites 
were found to be secondary deposits, places where material had been transported,

likely by flash floods. The animal and hominin bones in these cases had nothing 
to do with one another other than happening to end up in the same place. Other 
sites were found not only to not support the model, but actively contradict it. 
These sites were found to be not hominin habitations, but carnivore lairs or nat­
ural sinkholes where hominin bones, tools, and animal bones were mixed ran­
domly. The hominin bones at these sites were less likely the remains of ancient 
hunters, but of the hunted, just another prey animal. So, a fundamental mistake 
in logic, assume a correlation of factors entailed a causative relationship, played a 
major role in the construction of an anthropological fairy tale.
The next logical fallacy I want to present also played a role in many of the 
misinterpretations discussed so far: the argument from authority. Several fallacies 
are possible when one focuses not on the strength of a specific argument, but on 
the identity of the individual or individuals making the argument. An ad hom­
inem argument, for example, discounts someone’s argument based on some real 
or imagined characteristic of the arguer. “Poisoning the well” is essentially an ad 
hominem aimed at an entire group, say, all scientists, arguing that entire group 
possesses some undesirable trait and that their arguments should be discounted. In 
contrast, an argument from authority posits that someone’s argument should be 
accepted uncritically based purely on the authority and reputation of the arguer. 
We are evolved from social primates that lived in a social hierarchy and aligning 
oneself with the strongest and most powerful members of that hierarchy would 
have had a strong adaptive value. But today that leads us to accept statements based 
purely on the authority of the person making them.
Arguments from authority played a role in the case of several of the cautionary 
tales from anthropology outlined previously. Piltdown was accepted in part 
because of the professional status of many of the scientists that endorsed it. Aleš 
Hrdlička’s authority and prestige effectively shut down scientific investigations 
of Native American antiquity until faced with irrefutable physical evidence. The 
Calico Site was brought to international, if temporary, prominence due to its 
association with the legendary figure of Louis Leakey. The killer ape theory, with 
its shaky archaeological underpinnings, persisted in part due to the authority of 
figures like Dart.
Another broad category of logical fallacies includes situations where an idea is 
judged to be true, not on the evidence for the idea itself, but on the popularity 
of the idea, or the length of time over which the idea has been believed true. 
These include arguments from popularity, arguments from antiquity, and appeals 
to tradition. Just because many people believe something to be true, or because 
the belief has existed for a long time, or has become part of the traditions of a 
culture (or of a science), does not make that idea true. While appeals to tradition 
are essentially at the core of the culture concept in anthropology, the tendency to 
appeal to “received wisdom” is less defendable in a scientific setting. In science, 
it should be the facts that guide interpretation, not the popularity or age of that 
interpretation.

Regrettably, science being a human endeavor, this is seldom the case. Old ideas, 
widely held within a discipline, but well past their sell-​by date, often persist purely 
by dint of a sense of tradition, sometimes for generations of scientists. Scientific 
“revolutions”, where new, radical interpretations replace outmoded ideas to form 
a new paradigm, while transformational, are not inevitable, and can be held back 
by force of tradition (Kuhn 1962).
One salient example of the use of an appeal to tradition can be drawn from 
the dominant paradigm for archaeology during the late nineteenth to early twen­
tieth century. This period saw the maturation of archaeology from the hobby of 
wealthy European elites, focused mainly on collecting (some would say looting) 
of antiquities largely from colonized territories to an academic discipline. By 
the early twentieth century, a codified approach to the organization of archaeo­
logical data, and a general approach to explaining variation in that data, was widely 
employed. This came to be known as the “culture history” approach in archae­
ology. There were several underlying assumptions to this approach. First, “archaeo­
logical cultures” (identified patterns of material culture that could be bounded in 
time and in space) were seen as closely related to actual past human cultures. When 
one spoke of “Hallstadt culture” referring to Iron Age sites in Central Europe, one 
assumed that the recurring patterns in artifacts of certain types within a specific 
region and period indicated a specific cultural group. Second, these cultures were 
seen as composed of norms and their associated behaviors. Everyone in a given 
culture shared the same norms, expressing them in similar behavior, thus creating 
the archaeological cultures in question.
This explanatory paradigm led to the construction of “culture histories” where 
sequences of changing material culture were viewed as evidence of the develop­
ment of real past cultures. The emphasis was on typology: what types of artifacts 
were “diagnostic” of certain periods of time in specific geographic settings. Often 
extensive excavations were conducted, and millions of artifacts inventoried, purely 
in the exercise of determining what the chronologic sequence of artifacts was in 
a particular area. Detailed seriations of ceramic types, stone tool types, metal tools, 
or other artifacts, were developed and still form the core of archaeological research 
across much of the world.
While culture history archaeology was responsible for organizing vast arrays 
of archaeological data and creating cultural chronologies used to this day, the 
work was largely descriptive with little attention to interpreting meaning. When 
archaeologists did address change and variation in the archaeological record, they 
tended to fall back on tried-​and-​true explanations based on the diffusion of ideas 
or the migration of ancient populations. This tendency was congruent with the 
model of cultures as monolithic entities based on invariant social norms and 
reflected in cohesive archaeological assemblages. Change could not, in this para­
digm, come from within, it must encroach from without. Few archaeologists, such 
as V. Gordon Childe (e.g., 1936), put much attention toward the way in which pre­
historic cultures might adapt and transform due to internal social processes. The

traditional, descriptive culture historical archaeology, championed by numerous 
authorities, prevailed well into the 1950s even as more and more archaeologists 
began to question its validity. The fact that those practicing a more interpretive 
archaeology, such as Childe, were also influenced by Marxist theories, likely kept 
their ideas from widespread acceptance during the early years of the Cold War.
The traditional descriptive focus of archaeology was severely critiqued during 
the 1960s. At first a few outspoken young archaeologists began to champion what 
was at first called “The New Archaeology”. Researchers such as Lewis Binford 
(e.g., 1962) argued that cultural process must be at the core of anthropology and 
adopted a generally evolutionist theoretical approach to explaining social process, 
as well as change and variation in the archaeological record. Now known as “pro­
cessual archaeology”, this explanatory approach would dominate archaeological 
research in the English-​speaking world for nearly 20 years. Even while it would in 
time be subjected to its own criticisms and found to harbor its own shortcomings, 
many archaeologists today practice what is in essence processual archaeology, at 
least in part I suspect out of a sense of tradition.
The Effect of Culture
Even anthropologists are embedded in social relations and cultural practices, which 
can affect our interpretations. This can, at times, lead us to embrace interpretations 
that are essentially pseudoscientific. The idea of scientists as dispassionate figures 
devoid of bias or emotion is a straw man. Scientists are every bit as subject to bias 
as anyone. The difference is scientists are in theory aware of this tendency, and 
work to remove bias as much as possible from our interpretations. However, some 
types of biases are particularly pernicious and difficult to identify in oneself. Chief 
among these is the biases of our own culture.
“Culture” is a fundamental concept to anthropology, and this is not the place 
for a detailed discourse on its meaning. Suffice it to say for our purposes that par­
ticipating in a culture predisposes someone to hold certain attitudes over others, to 
engage in certain courses of actions over others, and that one is in general largely 
unaware of these tendencies. While the culture of the scientist may have minimal 
effect on practitioners of natural or experimental sciences, it can have a profound 
effect on the social and behavioral sciences.
We can see an anthropological example of the effect of culture on researcher 
biases in the work of a number of biological and cultural anthropologists during 
the 1950s. I am referring again to hypotheses regarding the evolution of modern 
humans known as “Man the Hunter”. As already stipulated, the hypothesis supposes 
that hunting of large animals was the driving force in human evolution, and that 
this was the purview of males. Females, the thinking went, were too burdened 
with childcare, and had to “attach” themselves to a male provisioner to fulfill their 
food needs. The male gained status and access to an exclusive sexual relationship 
in the bargain. Key physical adaptations were all developed to aid in male hunting

success. Even our unusual hairlessness was considered an adaptation for sexual sig­
naling to allow females to secure male mates, as was the loss of estrus so females 
were permanently “receptive”. This overall concept became popularized in the 
book “The Naked Ape” (Morris 1967) and also at a 1966 conference, entitled 
“Man the Hunter”, organized by anthropologists Richard Lee and Irven DeVore 
(1968).
As the reader no doubt expects by this point there were some serious issues 
with the Man the Hunter theory, some of which have already been discussed. 
The evidence for early hominin hunting was found to be far less prevalent than 
originally thought. Evidence from modern hunting and gathering cultures were 
criticized as having been cherry picked from those groups who hunted the most, 
and were inhabitants of marginal environments with limited plant resources. Most 
significant, though, was the observation that the theory totally marginalizes female 
roles in hominin society.
So, while the males were out hunting, developing all their skills, learning 
to cooperate, inventing language, inventing art, creating tools and weapons, 
the poor dependent females were sitting back at the home base having one 
child after another and waiting for the males to bring home the bacon. 
While this reconstruction is certainly ingenious, it gives one the decided 
impression that only half the species-​the male half-​did any evolving. In 
addition to containing a number of logical gaps, the argument becomes 
somewhat doubtful in the light of modern knowledge of genetics and pri­
mate behavior.
Slocum 1975:42
Proponents of Man the Hunter interpretations had essentially projected the 
idealized gender roles of their own culture into the Paleolithic. Men were 
the providers, women the dependent caregivers. This “Leave it to Beaver” on the 
Serengeti was in large part a product of unconscious culture bias on the part 
of anthropologists, specifically white male anthropologists. This cultural bias led 
many researchers to ignore vital information, such as the dubious quality of the 
archaeological evidence, or the fact that female gathering typically produced at 
least half or more of the calories of modern hunter gatherers, and that women also 
had a key role in provisioning and supporting their male hunter partners.
Conclusions
Humans are a paradoxical species, in that we have evolved a stunning capacity for 
pattern recognition and rational processing of those patterns, and yet uncritical use 
of those abilities often leads us to the wrong answer. We make connections that 
don’t exist. We reach conclusions in advance of collecting data and then ignore 
much of that data. We would rather be wrong but feel right than actually be right,

especially if being wrong is important to our identity or group affiliation. Science, 
as a method, is designed to minimize the impact of these irrational tendencies, but 
this doesn’t always work and when it does it often takes time. Even some of the 
most highly regarded scientists have fallen victim to their own evolved tendencies, 
as a result espousing ideas that are laughable in hindsight.
In the chapters that follow I will explore the ways in which the human propen­
sity for cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and cultural biases have affected anthro­
pology. Some examples involve the research of legitimate, but ultimately misguided, 
anthropologists. Some are the work of pure pseudoscientists. Some exist in a gray 
area in between, as the demarcation between science and nonscience is a fuzzy 
boundary. But regardless of the professional qualifications of the researchers, all 
the examples present cases where embracing irrational patterns of reasoning led to 
highly suspect conclusions.

CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND 
THE INVENTED PRIMITIVE
Cultural anthropology, including ethnology, could be termed the “mother science” 
for anthropology. The study of human differences in belief, behavior, and social 
organization is foundational to anthropology and was a major issue in philosoph­
ical debates as far back as the Enlightenment. Hobbes and Rousseau based their 
arguments on the preferred model for modern society on reactions to then current 
knowledge and perceptions regarding traditional societies. Their political theories 
were based on a crude sort of cultural anthropology. Hobbes (1970) viewed life 
“in the state of nature” as arduous and violent, necessitating a strong monarch 
to staunch humanity’s darker instincts. In contrast, Rousseau (2018) viewed the 
lives of small-​scale peoples as peaceful and indolent, and argued that the modern 
world should emulate that of the noble savages of the past. Both philosophers 
were writing “from the armchair” as it were, without any direct experience of 
non-​Western cultures, but the ideas they enshrined in the Western philosophical 
cannon would resonate and find expression in the nascent field of anthropology 
a few centuries later.
The first two thirds of the twentieth century comprised an era of “classic eth­
nography”. This was the heyday of ethnographic field work, where European-​ or 
American-​trained researchers, most often a white male, would take up residence 
among a typically non-​Western, traditional society. Areas of research were glo­
bally distributed, but Africa, Australia, Amazonia, and Polynesia were dispropor­
tionally represented, as those were the regions where one could supposedly find 
the distant, primitive “other” that was the bread and butter of the ethnographer’s 
work. Through the process of participant observation, researchers of the period 
would seek to identify and contextualize the fundamental beliefs and structuring 
principles of the subject culture. Even as theoretical paradigms changed, the fun­
damental practice and methods of ethnography remained fairly constant: the

attempt to extract the authentic nature of non-​Western cultures even as the world 
in which those cultures existed was rapidly changing and modernizing.
Ultimately this epistemological need for authentic, unacculturated subjects led 
to a tendency on the part of ethnographers to attempt to tease apart the authentic 
and traditional from the intrusive and modern. The fact was nearly all “traditional” 
societies across the globe had been in contact with Western cultures, not to 
mention with one another, for centuries (see Wolf 2010). Even in contexts where 
direct contact with Westerners was minimal, Western trade goods and cultural 
concepts were present, and their impact on non-​Western cultures was consider­
able. Western diseases for which local immunity was minimal wrought immeas­
urable change in these societies. In response to this reality, the approach widely 
adopted by ethnographers of the time was to write in an artificial “ethnographic 
present” in the hopes that by depending on the memories of earlier, more trad­
itional times on the part of the oldest members of a culture, selectively ignoring 
anything that smacked of the West or diffusion from without, a picture of the pure 
culture could be extracted (Sanjek 1991).
This traditional form of ethnographic research came under criticism toward 
the end of the twentieth century (e.g., Burton 1988). The use of the ethnographic 
present, and the attempt to separate authentic elements of a non-​Western culture 
from any taint of the modern world was ultimately an exercise in fiction. These 
cultures were not being depicted as they actually were, but as the ethnographer 
wanted them to be. They were presented as somehow timeless, with no history and 
no potential for change or adaptation to a changing world, since the effect of the 
modern changing world was selectively ignored. Change in sociocultural theory 
later moved away from an idea of a static, rule-​based culture with a definable struc­
ture, to a fluid, performative view of culture that was continuously created through 
social interactions (Bourdieu 1977; Giddens 1979). In such a view, one cannot 
ignore any one element because all the elements of a culture influence one another.
The ethnographic desire for authentic, traditional, non-​Western cultures for 
anthropologists to investigate ultimately led to two types of anthropological 
pseudoscience. The first is what I term “the lost tribe narrative” and relates to 
situations where anthropologists have been essentially duped into believing they 
had encountered a truly pristine, uncontacted culture, devoid of unseemly Western 
influence. The second is what I term “pseudoethnography” where ethnographers 
researching real cultures chose to exaggerate or fictionalize aspects of those cultures 
to better fit an ethnographic narrative of a traditional people. Varying degrees of 
pseudoethnography are discussed in the following chapter. But it is to the first, the 
lost tribe narrative, that we now turn, and the story of one of the most notorious 
controversies in modern anthropology.
Lost Tribe Narratives and the Tasaday
From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, there were repeated narratives of 
Europeans encountering groups who had never met outsiders (Kirsch 1997; Moss 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive  25

2017). Ironically, while the oldest of these stories are “true” as Natives really were 
for the first time encountering Europeans and the “outside world”, the accounts 
of these encounters are the least credible. Steeped in ethnocentric bias and lacking 
a rational template to explain the existence of these cultures, European accounts 
of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries offer a distorted view of these 
early interactions. The perceived barbarity of the “other” was emphasized, and in 
some cases their very humanity was called into question (Johansen 2006:110). 
Conversely, by the time Enlightenment era thinkers were attempting to apply 
scientific rationalism to the study of non-​European populations, all their subjects 
had been impacted to some degree by European contact. In extreme cases entire 
populations were driven into extinction by war and disease. By the Industrial 
Revolution, the stereotypical lost tribe, the truly uncontacted group, was more a 
fictional device with little basis in reality.
This is not to say that there are no groups today who have little to no contact 
with the outside world. The governments of South American countries such as 
Brazil or Venezuela must contend with the needs and rights of many indigenous 
groups in their interior who are still very isolated from the outside world, some 
of whom actively resist contact with outsiders (e.g., High 2015). The same can 
be said of some island populations, such as the inhabitants of North Sentinel 
Island in the Indian Ocean, who killed an intruding American missionary in 2019 
(Schönhuth 2019). But, “very isolated” is not the same as uncontacted, and those 
groups who resist contact, in some cases violently, do so out of memory of past 
contact and the knowledge of the dangers it can bring.
In 1971, Manuel Elizalde, an official of the Philippine governmental organ­
ization tasked with administering Native cultures, PANAMIN, made a startling 
claim. In the jungles of Mindanao, there lived a group who called themselves 
the Tasaday. The Tasaday had supposedly never been contacted by outsiders until 
recently. Their language was unique, and they used only stone tools, though they 
had traded in recent years for steel machetes. They did not build houses or farm 
and lived in caves. They were a peaceful people, who lived together in harmony. 
They were, it seemed, Rousseau’s romantic idea of the noble savage brought to 
life, miraculously unchanged after centuries. The first popular article about the 
Tasaday closes with a reference to how the Tasaday apparently confirm Rousseau’s 
writings. It was as if the lost tribe narrative had been created with the Tasaday 
in mind.
Public and academic reaction to the discovery of the Tasaday was incredulous 
and swift. Limited media access was granted by the Philippine government, 
and initially meetings took place between a select group of anthropologists, gov­
ernment officials, and representatives of Associated Press and National Geographic. 
In 1972, National Geographic ran a story on the Tasaday: Stone Age Men of the 
Philippines (MacLeish 1972), and aired a documentary entitled The Last Tribes of 
Mindanao. A book entitled The Gentle Tasaday: A Stone Age People in the Philippine 
Rain Forest (Nance 1975) followed in 1975. Celebrity visitors flocked to the island 
and anthropologists clamored for information and access. In 1976 the Marcos

government barred access to outsiders, claiming concern for the group’s safety, 
though it was widely believed the real motivation was to dissuade visitors who 
might question the regime’s autocratic behavior. Further controversy arose in 
1983 when Elizalde fled from the Philippines, allegedly absconding with millions 
of dollars from the foundation established for the Tasaday’s protection, though he 
would later return a decade later.
The first anthropologist to interact with the Tasaday was Robert Fox. Fox 
was associated with the Philippine National Museum and PANAMIN (Hemley 
2003). Fox’s initial correspondence with Elizalde was measured and downplayed 
the possibility of a true “lost tribe”. But after only a few days of interacting with 
the Tasaday he forwarded a report to the Smithsonian Institution. Fox’s inter­
pretations portrayed the Tasaday as evidence of early human adaptations, as if 
they were found frozen in history. He hypothesized that they had been living 
in isolation for up to two millennia (Hemley 2006:42). Only one researcher, 
Douglas Yen (an ethnobotanist, not an ethnologist), spent any time with the 
Tasaday, approximately one month, far short of typical field duration (Headland 
1992a:9). Very few scholarly articles were published based on the very limited 
original research.
So, who were the Tasaday? How much of their original depiction is legitimate? 
It is worth discussing how they were initially presented to the world. One of the

first lines from the National Geographic article refers to the Tasaday as possessing 
“naked innocence”. They cannot “reckon time” and lived in a permanent now. 
They were “unmaterialistic” and had no interest in acquiring possessions. They 
had no leader and decided everything by consensus. They reacted with “amazed 
delight” at some modern technologies (flashlights), apprehension and fear at others 
(tape recorders), simple puzzlement at some (mirrors). They had no words for the 
sea, nor any for domesticated crops, despite being surrounded by farmers on an 
island surrounded by ocean. They had only recently learned to trap wild game or 
use bows. They were said to see outsiders as emissaries of their gods, fulfilling a 
myth of the arrival of divine outsiders. They are even referred to as “cavemen”, 
or as “animal like”, implying cultural simplicity but also evolutionary primitive­
ness. It should be noted that these supposed characteristics strained the credulity 
of most anthropologists (Headland 1992a:12), but there was little actual research 
available to judge.
Perhaps most alluring for the public, the Tasaday were said to have no words for 
war and to be unaware of weaponry. This despite a highly skewed gender ratio, two 
men to each woman, which seemed ideal for fomenting jealousy and violence. 
Violence over women is a known leading cause of violence among other foraging 
societies (Ferguson 2000). The Tasaday explained away this source of stress by 
referring to other, similar cave-​dwelling peoples in their vicinity who in the past 
had intermarried with them. These groups were never identified and had allegedly 
recently disappeared, but how or to where was never stated.
Some elements of the narrative style or general statements made in the National 
Geographic article might lead one to question the author’s objectivity. The perspec­
tive of the article is occasionally in the first person, from the Tasaday perspective, 
an authorial choice more suited to fiction than academics. The author may only 
have been reporting what they saw, but the style is not that of a dispassionate 
researcher. Then there is this aside where the author makes a broad argument 
regarding human nature:
Some scholars consider man to be a killer animal, the only hominid who 
bases his life on death. Our ancestor the Cro-​Magnon man killed frequently 
and included men among his victims. We, his descendants, are supposed 
to be innately murderous; and the actions of all civilized nations suggest 
strongly that we are. But the Tasaday, perhaps the simplest of living humans 
and those closest to nature, are gentle and affectionate.
While I have already critiqued the Man the Hunter narrative the author is dis­
puting in this passage, they are simply replacing one ideological narrative with 
another. It is probable that the author was reporting only those elements that 
agreed with what they wanted to be true, which is cherry-​picking, a common 
cognitive bias discussed in Chapter 1.
 
 

28  Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive
28
28
The author also criticizes anthropologists as having greatly overestimated the 
workload of traditional societies:
Anthropologists have long held that food-​gatherers who must spend all 
their time scrounging remain primitive and must keep constantly on the 
move. They are not settled enough to build and invent…
Here the author is engaging in a rhetorical device popularly known as a “straw 
man argument” where one attacks a simplified, distorted, or simply inaccurate 
version of someone else’s argument. By 1972 cultural anthropologists were well 
acquainted with the real lives of foraging peoples and the relative affluence of 
that adaptation (Sahlins 1968). The author is at best demonstrating ignorance of 
then current anthropological thinking, and at worst holding the Tasaday up as an 
example that refutes ideas nobody actually held at that time.
A critical evaluation might have noted some points that strained plausibility. 
For example, while it is possible a group might avoid contact with outsiders in 
the Mindanao jungle, how could such a small group (only 24 people) remain bio­
logically viable for so long without continuous contact and exchange? Such is the 
case of other known hunter gatherer cultures: they do not, in fact, cannot, exist in 
a social vacuum (Salazar 1992:80). While some of the Tasaday were said to have 
married into the population, it is made clear that contact was minimal and that 
small group size was a major problem in terms of mate availability, a situation that 
would have been unstable over any length of time. Other elements did not line up 
with anthropological tenets: the Tasaday were said to be without music, religion, 
or ritual or ceremonial life (Berreman 1992:23), which are generally held to be 
human universals, with archaeological evidence going back well into early human 
history. Hemley (2003:46) aptly captures this view:
The Tasaday had become the perfect time machine. It was almost as though 
humanity could be given another chance, that we could go back in time 
and visit our ancestors, who were not barbaric like us, we could learn from 
them, we could find out where we’d gone wrong, and the future might at 
least hold some promise.
While this narrative stuck some as too good to be true, most where entranced 
by the possibility. This brings up another common cognitive bias. People tend to 
dwell on possibility and ignore plausibility. We get hung up on the question of 
whether something is true or false and miss the question of how probable some­
thing is to be true or false. Given what you already know, how likely is something 
to be true? Prior knowledge will alter the degree to which a claim’s probability 
is deemed significant. Essentially, based on existing knowledge, the less plausible 
a claim, the greater the quality and amount of evidence required to deem that 
 
 
 
 

Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive  29

29
claim reasonable. In the words of Carl Sagan (1980), “extraordinary claims require 
extraordinary evidence”.
Given what we already knew about small-​scale, foraging cultures in the early 
1970s, the Tasaday should have been subjected to greater scrutiny. The group was 
implausibly small. They had been isolated for an unlikely long period. Their cul­
ture and technology were inconsistent with those of other small-​scale cultures. 
The fact that they had acquired steel tools, but then been directed by Elizalde to 
conceal any but the most primitive artifacts was problematic. The claims regarding 
the Tasaday where thus highly implausible, requiring extraordinary evidence, evi­
dence that was not forthcoming. Berreman (1992:25) summarizes the issue:
How could such a small society have persisted for so long with the sort 
of economy, technology, and diet attributed to them, especially in view of 
social isolation from, and geographic proximity to, agricultural villages?
Some did raise questions at the time. Zeus Salazar, an anthropologist, questioned 
estimates of the Tasaday’s isolation in 1971, arguing for at most 150 years of soli­
tude. Later linguistic studies showed the Tasaday language was rich in loan words 
from neighboring languages for a supposedly isolated group. Upon closer analysis 
the Tasaday “language” was determined to be a dialect of a known language in the 
region (Hemley 2003:75).
Salazar noted other “red flags”. All the available data on the Tasaday was 
published under the auspices of PANAMIN with no independent verifica­
tion. The Tasaday stone tools appear to have needed a metal tool to attach to 
a handle, while other tools, such as a bamboo jaw harp, also would have had 
to be fashioned with metal tools the Tasaday supposedly didn’t have (Peralta 
1992:158). Genealogies showed that the Tasaday were extensively intermarried 
with neighboring T’Boli, not nearly as isolated as originally thought (Salazar 
1992:78–​85), though Salazar’s genealogical reconstructions would be critiqued 
as underestimating Tasaday cultural cohesion (Rogel-​Rara and Nabayra 1992). 
The group left their caves every night, returning in the morning, and Elizalde 
would not permit any inquiry where they had been (Berreman 1991). The caves, 
allegedly their home for centuries, were suspiciously clean for primary dwellings. 
In fact, the original announcement of the Tasaday’s discovery by Elizalde made 
no mention of cave-​dwelling, just of a nomadic forest life (Thomas 2000:78). 
These numerous incongruities led a few anthropologists to doubt the veracity of 
the narrative being presented, but PANAMIN, Elizalde, and most of the public 
maintained the story was true.
Further anomalies accumulated over time. For example, while an archaeologist 
accompanied the original team to visit the Tasaday, they were not allowed to con­
duct any excavations. Archaeological investigations of nearby trash middens near 
the caves would have provided an objective measure of the length of occupation,

30
but anthropologists were forbidden to investigate them by Elizalde citing Tasaday 
cultural proscriptions regarding the plants that grew on the middens. This taboo, 
true or not, is suspiciously convenient if someone were seeking to obfuscate the 
reality of the Tasaday. Archaeologists were never allowed to excavate in the caves 
which would have settled the debate (Headland 1992c:219; Longacre 1992). The 
caves either contained evidence of long-​term human use, or they did not, but at 
this point we do not know as the work has never been done.
In general, Elizalde and PANAMIN were reluctant to allow outside research. 
Visits by researchers were limited in number and duration, and closely managed 
by Elizalde (Berreman 1991). Scientists studying the Tasaday in Elizalde’s absence 
were left without interpreters, impeding their research, and were occasionally 
harassed by mysterious gunmen, potentially the same guards left to protect them. 
Scientists studying the group were not sufficiently provisioned, and one researcher 
had to leave due to a resulting medical condition. Subsequent visits revealed the 
Tasaday making modifications of caves for personal comforts they’d supposedly 
done without for centuries or moving out of the caves entirely into structures they 
had supposedly no knowledge of how to build.
Available food resources near the Tasaday’s cave seemed improbably sparse to 
support even such a small population, and tracking their foraging showed them 
to collect only 40% of the calories needed for survival (Fankhauser 1992:127). 
The local rain forest is especially deficient in sources of carbohydrates (Headland 
1992b). Scientists attempting to study Tasaday foraging were horrified to find 
them receiving regular deliveries of rice from neighboring farmers. Upon hearing 
news of nearby strangers, the Tasaday reacted aggressively, taking up weapons 
for which they supposedly had no words or concepts. At least one Tasaday child 
seemed to disappear and be replaced by a different individual. There was much 
evidence to question the official story.
But, the narrative of the “last of the world’s innocents”, which depended on 
the group’s cultural simplicity and isolation, was too enticing for most to question. 
Film crews documenting Tasaday life were fresh from filming the Vietnam War, 
and apt to over-​idealize the Tasaday in comparison (Dumont 1988:270). Also, 
some of the scenes filmed are alleged to have been staged to enhance the seeming 
simplicity of the group. Elizalde’s and PANAMIN’s presentation of the Tasaday as 
poster children for Philippine indigenes threatened by logging and development 
steered hard into this narrative. The careers and credibility of key figures became 
dependent on the Tasaday being what they were alleged to be. The eventual 
closure of access to the group and cessation of outside research by PANAMIN, 
allegedly to protect the Tasaday, could also be read as an intentional concealment 
of contradictory evidence. Elizalde’s antagonism and PANAMIN’s obstructionism 
led to the resignation of most researchers from the project and research on the 
Tasaday ceased by 1972.
The renewed isolation of the Tasaday was not to last. During the collapse of the 
Marcos dictatorship, with outsiders again able to access the interior of Mindanao,

the Tasaday were once more thrust into the public media. Oswald Iten, a Swiss 
journalist with an anthropological background, had spent time going over the 
existing research on the Tasaday, and had identified many inconsistencies. In 1986 
he arranged to travel to Mindanao to see for himself. He had offered National 
Geographic the rights to publish any findings and been rebuffed. One of the first 
people Iten interviewed was a Philippine Catholic bishop, who stated bluntly 
“Don’t you know the story was faked? Some of my priests know the so-​called 
Tasaday personally” (Iten 1992:40). Intrigued by this, Iten arranged through the 
bishop’s contacts to be guided to Tasaday territory. What he found was troubling 
and seemed to confirm the bishop’s statement.
The Tasaday were found by Iten to be wearing modern clothes, using modern 
tools, and living in villages (Figure 2.1). While it is not unusual for indigenous 
peoples to acculturate and adopt modern dress and technology, this was a sudden 
and extreme departure from the naked, cave-​dwelling folk depicted only 14 years 
earlier. Even more surprising was, when visited only days later by German 
journalists, they were once again in their “ancestral” caves in their “traditional” 
natural garb worn over Western undergarments. The German journalists were 
then kidnapped, quite likely in an attempt to keep revelations about the Tasaday 
quiet. While poorly treated and abused, they were eventually ransomed.
The reasons for the changes in Tasaday lifestyle, Iten reported, was that the 
entire affair had been an elaborate hoax. One of the original Tasaday Elizalde 
presented to journalists, a major figure in Nance’s book, stated that the Tasaday 
were farmers from the region who had been forced by Elizalde to live in the caves 
and play the role of primitives. The Tasaday had always been farmers, had always 
been in contact with the outside world, and had always been just one of many 
indigenous populations of the Philippines. Local farmers near the Tasaday told 
Iten that local farmers of the T’boli and Monobo ethnic groups had been paid to 
“go naked to the caves” and pose as Stone Age foragers (Hemley 2003:94). Guns 
(as protection against rebels and bandits) and money were offered as incentives 
to participate in the charade. When questioned by Iten, the Tasaday corroborated 
these allegations.
Damage control began. Jesus Peralta (1992:162), an archaeologist with the 
Philippine National Museum, a colleague of Fox, part of the original party to 
view the Tasaday in 1971, as well as part of the 1986 visits, had the following to say:
It appeared that [the Tasaday] were conscious of the image that was wanted 
of them and, in fact, they were putting on a visual and even an auditive per­
formance. There was no indication…that they had been asked to attempt 
this seeming deception. It appeared rather to be a spontaneous attempt to 
maintain an appearance because of the economic benefits that it brought.
Peralta, who was among the first to raise several of the red flags regarding Tasaday 
authenticity, and who noted the Tasaday apery of primitive lifestyles for economic

32
benefit, ascribed the changes in Tasaday lifestyle between 1971 and 1986 to inter­
action with the neighboring groups, rather than a hoax.
The apparent hoax was laid at the feet of Elizalde. It was alleged that, at the 
urging of Elizalde, the Tasaday had fabricated a primitive lifestyle so well that they 
fooled journalists, officials, and academics. Once his goals had been met, Elizalde 
deserted the Tasaday. Hemley (2003:96) writes of Iten’s perceptions from 1986:
What had Elizalde’s hoax brought the Tasaday? Iten Wondered. In return 
for playing Stone Age Cavemen, they had been sealed off from the rest of 
the world. Elizalde’s promises and all their fame had brought the so-​called 
Tasaday only misery. The dirty ragtag group dressed in stained T-​shirts were 
among the poorest Filipinos Iten had ever seen. The Tasaday had played 
along, and Elizalde had callously abandoned them.
It is ironic that, while the Tasaday were said to be without religion, they allegedly 
did acknowledge the existence of a supreme being termed “The Owner” 
who “owned and protected the immediate environs of the caves from human 
depredations” (Berreman 1992:23). This figure makes a suspiciously apt descrip­
tion of Elizalde himself, or at least how he likely saw himself. Whether true belief, 
or metaphor for their benefactor, “The Owner” was done with the Tasaday.
Initial reaction to these revelations is illuminating. Elizalde and his supporters, 
when confronted with the evidence of Tasaday leading a modern life, didn’t deny 
the authenticity of the evidence so much as they attempted to side-​step its rele­
vance (Berreman 1992:21). What was important, they argued, was not so much 
whether the Tasaday really lived primitive lives as they were originally described, 
but their reality as a distinct culture.
This is a classic example of the rhetorical strategy of “moving the goal post”. 
This is when a claim is refuted by evidence (the Tasaday were not what they were 
claimed to be), and rather than admit the error, the claimant simply moves to a 
new claim. If unchecked, this can lead to a series of claims/​refutations/​adjusted 
claims, with the claimant never acknowledging the flaws of their arguments. When 
Elizalde was quoted as saying “In this whole case, the truth becomes insignificant. 
Whether the Tasaday are fake or not is really incidental” he was trying to move the 
goal post away from his original claim to one that could still be defended.
Other supporters of the Tasaday embraced different fallacies. Journalists and 
anthropologists who were criticizing Tasaday research were accused of denying 
the Tasaday’s existence (Headland 1992a:13–​14). No such claim was made; this 
was a straw man argument. Tasaday existence was never in question, the question 
was, were they really what Elizalde and his supporters made them out to be? 
Another straw man was erected by Western media who persisted in their support 
of the lost tribe narrative. The Tasaday lacked the ability to perpetrate such a hoax, 
so they must be real. But no one ever accused the Tasaday of being anything other 
 

Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive  33

33
than pawns of Elizalde, who used his own power and resources to execute the 
hoax (Iten 1992:56).
Elizalde himself was, in hindsight, a controversial figure, not what one would 
expect in a champion of indigenous rights. He consistently put publicity ahead 
of scientific investigation, selling filming rights, while withholding evidence 
from researchers. Even John Nance, author of the 1975 book on the Tasaday, 
characterized Elizalde as a “complex” and “arrogant” figure with a “penchant 
for publicity” (Nance 1975:30). He had been accused of transporting indigenous 
women to Manila for exploitation, as well as smuggling. Even more troubling 
were allegations of sexual assault and torture of Natives who fell into his disfavor 
(Hemley 2003:181; Thomas 2000:81). He was held to represent the worst of the 
Marcos regime. His later alleged theft of public funds makes sense if his discovery 
and “protection” of the Tasaday were an elaborate scam for financial gain and 
publicity.
Neighbors of the Tasaday stated that there was no such group, that they 
recognized individual Tasaday as former neighbors, and feared Elizalde’s motives 
were a land grab for mining (he had significant financial interests in mining com­
panies) and logging, or a publicity stunt (Hemley 2003:59). There were allegations 
that Elizalde and PANAMIN had engaged in a strategy of “forced primitiveness” 
for years, forcing Natives to pose naked for reporters, and herding Native groups 
into reserves and hamlets to control their movement and interactions with the 
outside world. In this view, the Tasaday were only the most recent example of 
long-​standing exploitation of Native people (Duhaylungsod and Hyndman 1992).
Financial motives notwithstanding, Elizalde was already a wealthy man. What 
was in it for him? Those who knew him have alleged his real motivation was power 
and influence. He had political aspirations and used his position in PANAMIN 
and association with the Tasaday to facilitate election to national office in the 
Marcos government. Following Marcos’s declaration of martial law in 1972, he 
actively courted Elizalde hoping to use Filipino Native groups as pro-​regime 
symbols: “Both Elizalde and Marcos recognized the potential of the Tasaday to 
put a gentle face, as it were, on totalitarianism” (Hemley 2003:84). The Tasaday 
were Elizalde’s ticket to the “big time” of Philippine society, and anything that 
threatened that ticket was sure to be strongly suppressed by PANAMIN.
The controversy made its way into academia. A conference held in the 
Philippines in 1986 saw heated arguments between “pro-​hoax” and “pro-​Tasaday” 
researchers. While this was supposed to be an impartial venue, the consensus of 
those involved strongly leaned against Tasaday authenticity. What little attention 
given to those who supported the original story, particularly John Nance, was 
hostile cross-​examination. Another conference held in Zagreb in 1988 was little 
better. None of the researchers who had spent any time with the Tasaday were 
invited, and the organizers dubbed themselves “hoax-​busters” (Hemley 2003:186). 
Initially several media outlets, including National Geographic, and the New York 
Times, were reluctant to publicize these developments, even publishing stories 
 
 

34  Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive
34
34
that supported the original lost tribe story. But stories did get out, and some 
news media, such as Newsweek, published stories supporting allegations of a hoax, 
including a 20/​20 ABC documentary, The Tribe That Never Was. Hemley (2003:8) 
notes that the revelation that the Tasaday were not “authentic” created a narrative 
that played well given the cynicism of the post-​Watergate, post-​Vietnam culture 
of the 1980s (Dumont 1988).
Major figures of anthropology weighed in. Richard Lee commented on the 
evidence in a 1992 volume compiling comments from all sides of the debate (Lee 
1992). Arguing that the Tasaday must be investigated within the broad context 
of Philippine indigenous cultures and their relation to the modern world, Lee 
unequivocally stated:
They may well constitute an ethnic group that has lived by foraging. But 
that is only a starting point. What they are not is a Stone Age relict popu­
lation locked in a time warp out of contact with the rest of the world for 
hundreds of years.
Citing the lack of middens at the caves, the insufficient local diet, the proximity of 
other villages, the insufficiency of the proposed tools, the absence of other alleged 
foragers in the area, and the lack of epidemic disease, Lee demolished the lost tribe 
narrative. Lee was also scathing of National Geographic’s credulous embracing of 
the lost tribe narrative while ignoring so many other groups that, while obviously 
in contact with Western society, still had much to offer in terms of understanding 
forager cultures (Lee 1992:168). Lee also commented on the extreme politiciza­
tion of the Tasaday question:
The view of the Tasaday as relics of the Stone Age is backed by some of the 
most powerful elements of the Philippine ruling oligarchy. And those who 
oppose this view of them are in many ways courageous dissidents.
And finally, Lee (1992:171) notes how the hoax narrative fit with the political 
discourse of the time:
The…discourse is one in which Western opinion makers take the raw 
materials of the primitive “Other” and construct hegemonic ideologies that 
mirror the temper of the times and reinforce prevailing values. And in the 
era of Reagan, Bush, Gorbachev, and Yeltsin, ideologies centering on the loss 
of innocence and shattered illusions seems particularly apposite.
Also weighing in was archaeologist Robert Carniero. While Lee critiqued the 
Lost Tribe narrative from the grounds of its implausibility, Carniero (1992) was 
concerned with their supposed Stone Age technology, particularly their stone 
tools. Carniero investigated the “stone axes” produced by the Tasaday. Two 
 
 
 

Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive  35
34
35
categories of stone axes were documented in 1971: “heirloom” axes and axes made 
on the spot for observers. While the supposed heirloom pieces were of gener­
ally better craftmanship than the pieces Tasaday constructed on demand, Carniero 
(working from photographs) observed common traits that led him to question 
their authenticity. Overall, the workmanship of the axes was “extremely crude and 
simple” with little attempt made to shape or sharpen the stone beyond its natural 
shape. The type of stone was highly crystalline, unsuitable for durable use as an 
axe. The hafting was crude and would have made it difficult to use the tools as 
axes, but only as hammers or pounders. They were entirely unlike any other stone 
tool documented in Philippine prehistory, and the explanation that they had let 
their stone working skills decay made little sense for a group that was supposedly 
dependent on stone technology until quite recently. These traits led Carniero to 
conclude (1992:179):
…in so far as the Tasaday’s stone tools bear on the issue of the group’s 
authenticity, they point toward the Tasaday being an artificially constituted 
group, hastily brought together and haphazardly equipped, rather than an 
authentic, pristine representative of a Stone Age people.
Researchers and photographers who had initially documented the group saw 
their reputations damaged. John Nance would go on to actively dispute the 
hoax narrative for the remainder of his career. Fox was accused of colluding with 
Elizalde, even of having provided the Tasaday’s stone tools. An archaeologist who 
viewed the tools in 1971 stated that they were “made using mental templates 
canalized through distinct cultural imperatives” (Peralta 1992:161), that is, that 
they were real tools. However, other archaeologists viewed them as fakes and most 
of the alleged tools went missing during the 1980s. Nance was accused of helping 
Elizalde perpetuate the hoax. One pro-​Tasaday witness at the 1986 conference 
was later killed, some believe in retribution for his testimony (Berreman 1991). 
In the post-​Marcos Philippines, the Tasaday were associated with a dictatorship 
that had sponsored and publicized them, and thus seen as both frauds and victims 
(Hemley 2003:148).
The whiplash nature of this change in narrative, from “lost tribe” to “hoax” is 
partly due to circumstance: difficulty of accessing information about the group, 
manipulation of the situation by the Philippine government and other parties, 
and the lure of sensationalist news stories. But we can also look to a common 
error of logic: the hasty generalization. A hasty generalization occurs when you 
seize upon the most obvious elements of a complex phenomenon and generalize 
those elements to characterize the entire phenomenon. It is one way in which our 
brains render the complex simple and comprehensible. Simplicity equates to rap­
idity of reaction, which would provide a selective advantage. The problem is that, 
as the world becomes more complex, minimizing that complexity leaves more 
and more out, eliminating nuance, leaving an oversimplified impression. We see

this most often in politics, where all members of a bloc or party are characterized 
by a small number of terms: “tax and spend liberals” or “socially conservative 
republicans”. Ether term glosses over significant internal diversity in favor of a 
pithy generalization.
In the Tasaday case, the narrative of a peaceful Stone Age tribe took a few 
supposed facts, that they lacked metal tools, that they lived in caves, and that 
they claimed to have never been contacted. From these characteristics, an 
entire generalized but ultimately fictional identity for the Tasaday was created 
by Western writers. Despite no long-​term observation, an image of an inno­
cent, peaceful and simple culture was created. The reality of the lived exist­
ence of the culture was given little emphasis in contrast to the emotionally 
fulfilling narrative. The fact that this narrative served the interests of the Marcos 
government, as well as many in the anthropological community, meant that 
nobody was motivated to see where the narrative differed from reality. Sponsel 
(1992:201) noted “… the Tasaday represent a complex symbol with multiple 
meanings, regardless of whether or not they are in any sense and whatever 
degree authentic”.
Another issue was raised by Berreman (1991). He noted a curious 
pattern: many who initially had expressed skepticism about the Tasaday were 
not only eventually convinced of their authenticity but went on to become 
some of their most ardent defenders. Berreman likened this pattern to that 
identified by psychologists who have studied apocalyptic cults. In these situ­
ations, it is not unusual for participants to find their beliefs strengthened, even 
when the prophesized doomsday repeatedly fails to occur. We now refer to this 
as the “backfire effect” (see Nyhan 2010). When someone has a belief that is 
fundamental to their ideology and identity, threats to that belief paradoxic­
ally can strengthen the belief. Even worse, these “true believers” often become 
proselytizers, attempting to convince and convert others. Thus, pseudoscience 
metastasizes through society.
In the case of the Tasaday, some initial skeptics became so associated with the 
idea of Tasaday primitiveness that no amount of contrary evidence would be likely 
to convince them. Instead, they would double down and insist on Tasaday as a 
true Stone Age people despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The back­
fire effect is a continuing cautionary tale for educators: often providing facts isn’t 
enough and can make people believe false ideas all the harder. Berreman specif­
ically calls out John Nance, probably the individual most responsible for popular­
izing the Tasaday:
Nance’s…activities have been typical of a convert to true belief, acknow­
ledging his past doubts, testifying to his present beliefs and to the virtue and 
insights of those who converted him and other who share his commitments, 
while proselytizing the uninformed and challenging nonbelievers to cast 
aside their doubts and disbelief to join the faithful. Thus, in the course of 
 
 

Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive  37
36
37
his account in The Gentle Tasaday, he first expresses and then exorcises his 
doubts. By its end he seems to have convinced himself. Since by that time 
he has…devoted himself to writing, speaking, and showing films –​ energet­
ically soliciting a large number and variety of audiences in order to bring 
them the word, to convince them, to convert them to his faith. He became, 
and remains, a “true believer” in the authenticity and significance of the 
Tasaday.
Berreman also points out how true believers of Tasaday authenticity have attempted 
to discredit the opinions of skeptical anthropologists, saying that skeptics are all 
people who have never actually directly interacted with the Tasaday, so their 
opinions are worthless. This is another favored tactic of those proposing implaus­
ible ideas with poor supporting evidence. While true believers may have met the 
Tasaday and while most anthropologists have not, the anthropologists have made 
their entire career out of studying human cultures and have a vast store of know­
ledge to draw upon to put the claims regarding the Tasaday in context. And when 
placed in that context, the claims make very little sense. It’s really the equivalent 
of a young Earth creationist telling a paleontologist “you have never seen a dino­
saur, so you can’t prove they weren’t on Noah’s Ark”. You don’t need firsthand 
observations to recognize flawed arguments.
Tasaday proponents have also argued that those who deny their authenticity are 
diminishing the status and authenticity of all indigenous groups in the Philippines, 
and leaving these groups open to loss of government aid and theft of land (e.g., 
Malony 1992:116). First off, this is another reframing of the straw man argu­
ment: no anthropologists have ever said that the Tasaday were not an indigenous 
group having all the same rights of any other indigenous group. You could also 
look at it as another position for the ever-​moving goalpost regarding pro-​Tasaday 
claims. Finally, we can introduce yet another logical fallacy for this argument. 
This is an example of the argument from final consequences. For example, if you 
provide young people with birth control, they will become more promiscuous. 
Leaving aside the complete lack of evidence for the claim, the argument says 
nothing about the validity or appropriateness of birth control, only that there is a 
possible consequence the claimant doesn’t like. The question of who the Tasaday 
were, and what was the truth of the lost tribe narrative, is entirely unrelated to any 
possible outcome of any counterclaim. This is not to say that scientists should not 
care about the outcome of their research, only that these outcomes do not affect 
the validity of the research.
This is distinct from how the public and the media view the issue. Bodley 
(1992) notes that, even while anthropologists would not conflate the issues of cul­
tural isolation with human rights, the media and the public are apt to do just that. 
The extent that indigenous groups are seen as deserving of protection and rec­
ognition is often tied to the issue of authenticity, being “pristine” and previously 
isolated. The more acculturated a society becomes, the less deserving they are seen 
 
 
 

38  Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive
38
38
to be of receiving governmental protection and aid. The issue is nuanced, while 
public opinion tends to be simplistic:
Isolation must be recognized as a relative concept and a matter of degrees. 
It need not be present or absent in any absolute sense. It reveals more about 
a group’s political and economic autonomy at a given moment than about 
its prehistory. Indigenous groups have maintained contacts of various sorts 
with outsiders at different points in the past. Peoples can move in and out of 
contact in different generations.
Bodley 1992:198
Even in the United States, Native American tribes must demonstrate significant 
cultural identity and integrity to be federally recognized. Paradoxically, groups 
that have been the most impacted by colonization are viewed as least deserving 
of protection by the descendants of colonizers. Again, this does not mean that 
anthropologists, when presented with cases like the Tasaday, should ignore the 
implications of their research, even if those results may be seen as having negative 
consequences. It does, however, put a burden on anthropologists to educate those 
in power and attempt to mitigate the impact of their research on their subjects.
Robin Hemley travelled to the Philippines in 1999 to investigate the dueling 
narratives. He was initially receptive to the hoax narrative and convinced that 
Elizalde was the villain of the story. Surprisingly at his first meeting with the 
director of the Philippine National Commission for Indigenous Peoples, who 
was one of the translators for Elizalde and the Tasaday, he was told a story that 
corroborated the original “lost tribe” narrative. The Tasaday were an isolated, poor 
group with limited technology, though they were in contact with their neighbors. 
So, not so much a “lost tribe” as a “particularly poor tribe among poor tribes”. 
The term “Tasaday” was an error of translation and was simply a reference to the 
group’s geographic location. And apparently some of those who visited the Tasaday 
after Iten’s 1996 “scoop” were still convinced of their authenticity, though one of 
these was John Nance who was not a disinterested party. There were conflicts of 
interest on either side; for example, one proponent was also a government official 
who oversaw the logging industry. If the Tasaday were not a true “people” then 
their land was not worthy of protection.
A different story was provided by the director of the National Commission 
for the Arts. The Tasaday were one of many poor groups in the interior, lived in 
houses (which were even visible in 1950 aerial maps), but also used caves when 
hunting. While not the simple cave folk of the lost tribe narrative, they were 
an ethnic group with their own dialect, distinct from most of their neighbors. 
They didn’t really fulfill the details of the hoax narrative either. As for Elizalde, 
he was described as a “well-​meaning but misguided dilettante”, rather than the 
sinister figure portrayed in the hoax narrative (Hemley 2003:114). This seems in 
contradiction to Elizalde’s actions, which are difficult to explain as anything other

39
than self-​interested. Hemley later attempted to travel to Tasaday territory. On the 
way he interviewed several individuals, both Native and government, who were 
involved with previous investigations, all of whom were evasive about Tasaday 
authenticity. His group were menaced by armed men, who may have been Tasaday 
defending their territory with weapons donated by PANAMIN.
Palmer (2000) puts the Tasaday case in the context of anthropology’s struggle 
with European colonialism, an exploitive process that did incalculable damage 
to indigenous peoples but presented cultural anthropology with its foundational 
subjects. Arguably without colonialism you don’t have a modern field of anthro­
pology. Coming to grips with this less-​than-​laudable history has led anthropologists 
to be selective in how cultures are presented, including lies of omission that border 
on misrepresentation. This is attributable to subconscious aspirations on the part 
of anthropologists, an innate desire to present worlds that should be rather than 
worlds that are:
Paradise…is part of the myth constructed in the gap between hope and 
reality, creating the goals that are necessary in people’s lives, and can be 
detected in their depictions of the cultural “other”.
Palmer 2000:239
Such misrepresentations generally took the form of taking a complex society 
and presenting it in a simplified manner, examples of the sweeping general­
ization fallacy: “Collectively, the reduction of primitive cultures to simplistic, 
single-​dimensional identities is an all-​too-​common practice in the rich symbolic 
environment of global communication” (Palmer 2000:223).
Groups such as the!Kung of South Africa, or the Yanomami of South America 
were among those groups misrepresented. Chagnon emphasized Yanomami vio­
lence to the point of caricature (see Chapter 3), and the !Kung were mispresented 
as peaceful and devoid of internal conflict. Nor were the Tasaday the only hoax 
perpetuated on anthropologists; the experiences of Margaret Mead in Samoa have 
been critiqued as being simplistic, unrepresentative, and potentially fabricated by 
her subjects. Mead was criticized for not being versed in the nuances of Samoan 
culture and mistaking adolescent boasting and fabrication for real statements 
regarding sexual practices.
However, the counternarrative that developed after the hoax was uncovered 
was no less a generalization. Hemley (2003:205) writes: “the words ‘hoax’ and 
‘authentic’ are essentially ways of falsely simplifying and bringing closure to some­
thing that is actually much more complex”. From the moment the story broke that 
the Tasaday were not primitive cave dwellers, the narrative became that there was 
no legitimacy to the culture at all, that they did not warrant any attention, and that 
everything about them was fake. Some anthropologists (e.g., Berreman 1992:22) 
did maintain that the Tasaday were worthy of research attention even if they were 
part of a hoax, but this did not translate to the wider academic field. Again, from 
 
 

40  Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive

a few salient facts, that they were one of many groups of small-​scale farmers in 
the Philippines, and that they had pretended to be something else, the generaliza­
tion became the Tasaday were a fake people, not worthy of attention. Some even 
extended this to an indictment of the field of anthropology. If anthropologists 
were so easily fooled, how valid could anthropology be?
The hoax narrative did not account for numerous facts about the group, 
facts that were not considered by anthropology or Western media at the time. 
Some of the original Tasaday encountered at the cave sites seemed physic­
ally frail, not someone Elizalde would have picked if he were setting up a 
hoax. Elizalde had authorized a genetic study that noted connections between 
Tasaday and non-​Tasaday neighbors, a curious action if he had perpetrated 
a hoax. Tasaday origin stories were consistent between different researchers, 
albeit with some possible modern additions. Even Iten, who broke the hoax 
story, acknowledged that the Tasaday caves were sacred to the group, their 
mythological origin, and not arbitrarily chosen for disingenuous reasons (Iten 
1992:45). Their marriage pattern fit a patrilocal exogamous pattern (women 
marrying in from outside, living with the husband’s father), unlikely in an 
“artificial” hoax. Failing archaeological excavations at the caves, some sort of 
empirical test was required.
One of the few researchers who continued to investigate the Tasaday, Lawrence 
Reid, conducted an analysis of the Tasaday language. He already had reservations 
about the hoax story. Reid assumed that if the Tasaday were a hoax, this would be 
readily apparent in linguistic data. Either they would be speaking a known lan­
guage, or there would be obvious artificial alterations to a known language. The 
results of Reid’s analysis indicated that their language, while a dialect of the local 
Monobo language, had been developing in relative isolation for quite some time. 
This was corroborated by different linguists working independently from Reid. 
Whatever the Tasaday language was, it was not simply a known local language, nor 
was there evidence that the language had been constructed. There was an absence 
of Spanish loan words, or of words from other local dialects, not what one would 
expect from an acculturated group.
Reid’s work corresponds with that of Carol Malony (Malony 1992). Malony 
also noted that there were no Spanish loan words in the vocabulary, while 
neighboring languages have abundant Spanish terms. However, Malony’s collected 
vocabulary was only 800 words. Also, she notes “many words have been borrowed 
from neighboring non-​Manobo languages” (Malony 1992:111). The absence 
of Spanish might be taken as evidence of isolation, but the presence of words 
from neighboring languages indicates that isolation couldn’t have been very long. 
Malony also noted that the Tasaday had verbs for planting, not in keeping with a 
nonagricultural past.
Also in agreement is Richard Elkins, who notes that Tasaday differs from 
other dialects in its degree of retention of older word forms, which indicates 
some duration of isolation (Elkins 1992). Some Tasaday word forms seem to 
 
 

Cultural Anthropology and the Invented Primitive  41
40
41
vary in ways consistent with their jungle environs. Elkins also notes that Tasaday 
behavior, including their ease with public affection, were quite different from 
other Monobo-​speaking populations. However, Elkins was only able to spend 
a few days with the Tasaday in 1971, and his compiled word list was also small. 
All this said, Johnston (1992:145), a Monobo expert, played Tasaday recordings 
to other Monobo speakers. His informants, while noting differences, stated that 
Tasaday was within “acceptable limits for people whom they considered to be 
Monobo”. Johnston estimated the correlation of Tasaday with Catobato Monobo 
to be approximately 90%. This correlation would seem to rule out the extensive 
isolation supposed by the Lost Tribe narrative but is divergent enough to also rule 
out the most stringent interpretation of the hoax narrative.
Reid had kept recordings of Tasaday conversations from 1970s. He contended 
that these tapes show an ease of conversation and a sense of cultural identity that 
would be hard to fake. Also, most of the hoax proponents argued that the Tasaday 
were members of the T’Boli-​speaking ethnic group, who speak a different language 
than the dialect used by the Tasaday; those T’Boli who are also fluent in Monobo 
speak a different dialect from that spoken by the Tasaday. Reid concluded that if 
anyone was guilty of a hoax, it was those who were claiming that the Tasaday were 
themselves a hoax (Reid 1992). Hoax proponents, it should be noted, discount 
these arguments (Berreman 1992:30) arguing that speaking a distinct dialect of a 
known language does not itself argue for cultural isolation. Groups that regularly 
interact still develop distinct languages. This also renders the dueling genealogical 
reconstructions equivocal; people can intermarry with their neighbors, while still 
maintaining a distinct genealogy.
Reid (1992:189) estimated that the Tasaday had been isolated for one to two 
centuries, or “five or six generations at the most”. This is a far cry from the lengthy 
isolation in the Lost Tribe narrative, but it does create a compelling case study. 
Reid hypothesized that the Tasaday had fled European encroachment into the 
jungle, but had maintained limited relations with neighboring groups, developing 
farming and adopting iron tools. They existed in semi-​isolation until the middle of 
the twentieth century when they began to interact more regularly with neighbors 
and outsiders. That was their situation when they were brought to Elizalde’s 
attention.
So, rather than the romantic narrative of a lost tribe living in isolation, or a cyn­
ical story of a hoax, the reality seems to be a group fleeing from the modern world, 
and gradually reaching a tenuous accommodation with that world. Some Tasaday 
did likely participate in Elizalde’s machinations. The Marcos government likely 
encouraged Elizalde, or at least didn’t ask many questions. Hemley (2003:305) 
notes that many of the most active hoax proponents had connections to anti-​
Marcos factions. They were mostly affiliated with the University of the Philippines 
(UP), which Marcos had persecuted due to student uprisings. No UP personnel 
were allowed access to the Tasaday (Longacre 1992:194). Perhaps some of the hoax 
proponents weren’t reacting to the Tasaday, as much as their association with the

old regime? Being “courageous dissidents” as they were described by Lee does not 
make them correct in their assessment.
We can say elements of the Lost Tribe narrative are true, and elements of the 
hoax narrative are true, but the reality is more complex and worthy of investiga­
tion: “The Tasaday did not deliberately deceive the public, but neither were they 
primitive foragers isolated for hundreds of years from outside contact” (Headland 
1992c:). The Philippine government eventually split the difference, stating that the 
Tasaday were an authentic minority, but not commenting on the original story. 
Hemley (2003:295–​296) summarizes this complex view:
There’s little doubt that the Tasaday as “discovered” by Elizalde in 1971, had 
become a media construction by 1972. They were not the anthropological 
find of the century, nor had they been isolated for a thousand years or more. 
But this transformation was not all Elizalde’s doing: it fed a hungry public’s 
imagination. The Tasaday were pseudo-​archaics in Claude Lévi-​Strauss’s ter­
minology, a small group that had fled into the forest to escape an epidemic 
of some sort. By 1986 they had become what anthropologist Richard Fox 
calls professional primitives.
However, most interested parties remained polarized, and debate continued into the 
1980s. Elizalde contributed to the debate after he returned in 1986. Acting through 
intermediaries in the evangelical community, he attempted to turn back the clock 
and renew the lost tribe narrative. In this version, the caves were the original home 
of the group, the villages a “second home”. Ironically this is closer to the truth. Later 
hearings in the Philippine congress did little to clarify the issue, as either side sought 
to manipulate events to their benefit (Hemley 2003:168–​169). Some witnesses previ­
ously brought forward by hoax proponents recanted their original testimony, claiming 
coercion by Elizalde’s minions, while witnesses on either side claimed coercion was 
being put on them to recant during the hearings. National Geographic’s centennial 
issue acknowledged the hoax allegations but stated they were unsubstantiated.
The Tasaday remain in a state of social, political, and economic limbo. They 
are one of many “ancestral domain claimants” petitioning the Philippine gov­
ernment for recognition based on a lengthy ancestry, though tainted by Elizalde’s 
intervention. Even as anthropologists are coming to recognize the complexity and 
nuance of the Tasaday story, most discussions remain mired in controversy. A 2006 
conference, intended to move beyond these issues, was dominated by debates over 
authenticity and evidence for a hoax (Castillo, 2009:76). The group today lives 
much as their neighbors do, with the exception that they will don “authentic” 
Native dress when confronted with outsiders. Through repetition, reward, and 
performativity, the “inauthentic” has become a part of their modern culture.
If for the Tasaday that which makes them distinct from others is their perform­
ance of a Stone Age culture, then this cultural element may still be performed

years after. This could be the cultural element they overcommunicate when 
there are outsiders but it may not be the same cultural elements they com­
municate with other Manobo groups. The point here is that in the process 
of the formation of their identity, the Stone Age cultural element may have 
already become part of their identity because it was a significant experience 
serving as an ethnic boundary vis-​a-​vis specific others.
Castillo 2009:79
We should comment on the role media played in the events surrounding the 
Tasaday. There is the effect media attention had on the Tasaday case. Aggressive 
media coverage does not make ideal conditions for good science. Headland 
(1992a:12) notes “the media blitz…sensationalized this case to the point where 
it is impossible to conduct an independent scientific study of it today”. Then 
there is the effect media has on popular understanding of complex topics. Much 
of the information regarding the Tasaday that reached public awareness was not 
scientific: “… journalists rather than anthropologists dominated the story of the 
Tasaday …” (Hemley 2003:187). Major media outlets were central in the simpli­
fication of both conflicting narratives, the lost tribe vs. the hoax. From the media 
perspective, this is a “feature, not a bug”. It’s the news media’s job to take complex 
concepts and events and boil them down to something the largest number of 
people can understand and are interested in reading or watching. Print space or 
airtime is limited, and the consumer’s attention span is short. A news story must 
grab attention fast and can’t count on maintaining attention for very long. The 
nature of media leads almost inevitably to hasty generalizations.
There is a tendency in media to start with a predetermined narrative, and only 
report those elements that support that narrative. This is confirmation bias and 
cherry-​picking, both anathema to objective science. Hemley (2003:117) points to 
this tendency in the Tasaday controversy:
Of course, reporters in general, and television reporters in particular, are 
rarely, if ever, given the green light to do a story and come back with what­
ever truth they might uncover. That would cost a network too much money. 
Television journalists tend to approach a story with a particular angle and 
then try to prove their point. Confirmation bias … is a given, even a virtue, 
rather than the occupational hazard it is to anthropologists.
This is even the case for educational or investigative media. Even when a program 
or an article is presented as an objective investigation, an astute consumer should 
keep in mind the interpretations presented are influenced, if not mandated, by 
editors and producers. In this case, when NBC and National Geographic wanted 
to present a lost tribe, that is exactly what their correspondents found. And when 
the media wanted to air a hoax story, that was what was found, and nuances in the 
case were again ignored.

The collaborative relationship between National Geographic and Elizalde was 
fundamental to the entire Tasaday affair. Thomas (2000:83) notes:
National Geographic glorified the activities of Manuel Elizalde Jr. and 
PANAMIN in Mindanao. In return, Elizalde and PANAMIN offered 
National Geographic exclusive access to visit and photograph the Tasaday. 
The cooperation of writers and photographers from National Geographic 
was essential to Elizalde’s plan for PANAMIN control of the tribal people 
and their land and resources in South Cotabato, Mindanao.
This is not to say that National Geographic was aware of possible misrepresenta­
tion, but both parties were probably sufficiently eager to take advantage of oppor­
tunities they presented each other that editorial skepticism was impaired. Thomas 
(2000:84) goes on to indict the role of academia and the media in general:
The complicity of journalists and academics (anthropologists included) 
in authenticating Elizalde’s stone-​age Tasaday tribe was necessary for 
PANAMIN … to seize control of tribal land and resources and to wage a 
campaign of terror and violence against the tribal people of South Cotabato, 
Mindanao.
It is important to keep track of the real potential for harm and misfortune in 
embracing irrational and pseudoscientific arguments, even if one means well. The 
effect of the affair on the Tasaday themselves is complicated. It does seem that they 
benefitted from Elizalde’s attention at that of Western observers. Food and tools 
particularly were given as gifts to the group during visitations. Also, the Tasaday 
enjoyed a degree of protection from a hostile world, with their land protected 
from the logging, gold mining, and banditry that afflicted many indigenous groups 
during a time of disruption in the country.
On the other hand, once Elizalde had gotten what he wanted from the Tasaday 
he washed his hands of them, and once access to the group was halted, the enforced 
isolation of the Tasaday reserve worked against them. Leaving them alone in the 
interest of preventing disease or disruption kept them from benefitting from any 
of the positive effects of development, including medicine, economic opportunity, 
and education (Iten 1992:48–​49). One Tasaday lamented “we were poor before 
Elizalde came, but now we are even poorer” (Iten 1986).
The abandonment of the Tasaday was only exacerbated by the hoax narrative 
after 1986 that robbed them of their uniqueness as a supposed lost tribe. In 1988 
several Tasaday and Elizalde sued prominent hoax proponents for libel, but soon 
thereafter, the Tasaday were driven from their reserve by the Philippine army. It 
is likely that the military came to suspect they were sympathetic to insurgents 
(Hemley 2003:197). In the end, the Tasaday ended up with far less than when they 
were first brought to the world’s attention.

We can look at the damage to anthropology. The disciplinary soul-​searching 
the incident kicked off among anthropologists was seized upon by those with 
ideological objections to central premises of anthropological research. Primarily 
this was found among creationists, who view the world through a fundamen­
talist reading of the Bible. The world we see today in such a view is minimally 
changed from the world created by God in the recent past. The Earth is typically 
calculated to be approximately 6,000 years old based on the Book of Genesis. 
Such a timeframe does not include any opportunity for change and development, 
that is, evolution, and the assumption of God’s perfected design obviates the need 
for any such change. So, creationists vehemently reject any evidence of develop­
mental change over time. This comes in the form of critiques of evolutionary 
theory, or “Darwinism”.
If anthropologists were so wrong about the Tasaday, might they be wrong 
about everything? Might the endeavor of studying cultural change over time 
be fundamentally flawed, obscuring the reality of a divine creation? To the aca­
demic mind this is laughable, and a clear example of fallacy of “poisoning the 
well”. If anthropologists have an interest in portraying groups as primitive to get 
published and promoted, creationists would argue you can disregard the entire 
field of anthropology. Even as academics reject these arguments as fallacious, larger 
numbers of laypeople give them credence, and this contributes to a climate of 
anti-​intellectualism.
In the next chapter we turn to circumstances where anthropologists have 
conducted ethnologies of “real” cultures but have mispresented those cultures in 
order to create and support a favored narrative.

ETHNOLOGY VS. 
PSEUDOETHNOLOGY
Before we investigate the issue of pseudoscience in cultural anthropology, or 
“pseudoethnology”, we have to ask the question: what makes cultural anthro­
pology a valid academic field? We are dealing with a social science, so the standards 
are different than for natural sciences. We cannot perform controlled experiments 
for the most part. The sheer number of variables affecting human cultures, and 
the fact that cultures change over time, mean it is even unlikely that different 
researchers will achieve the same results on the same culture, though some degree 
of congruity would be expected. So, when someone is conducting ethnology, how 
do we know it’s “good ethnology”, not “bad ethnology”, or pseudoethnology?
Cultural anthropology does exhibit consistency in methods between 
ethnographers, that is to say, there are standards of practice. These include collecting 
data through long-​term immersion in a culture, what is typically termed “partici­
pant observation”. Human cultures are so complex, a quick investigation will not 
suffice, and the patterning observed in one culture need not apply to another. 
Only by embedding in a society repeatedly for a substantial length of time can 
an anthropologist ensure that they are collecting representative and accurate data.
That data is also looked at comparatively. Even while one anthropologist might 
make an entire career out of a single culture, there is broad awareness of the value 
of cross-​cultural patterning and learning what a specific culture can tell us about 
human culture as a whole. This is all to say, that ethnology is evidence-​based, and 
the collection of data is as rigorous and standardized as is possible given such a 
hugely variable topic.
Cultural anthropology research is also undertaken with theoretical paradigms 
that guide data collection and interpretation. There is a broad consensus on how 
data should be interpreted and what it means. This consensus changes over time 
as theoretical paradigms are developed, and perhaps even rejected, but there 
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  47
46
47
is a collective understanding of what the data mean and how they should be 
collected and interpreted. This is in contrast to pseudoethnology, which often 
defies anthropological consensus, generally through the baseless assumptions of 
individuals working outside the academic mainstream.
Another aspect of modern cultural anthropology that differentiates it from 
its pseudoscientific counterpart is ethical standards of practice. Ethnological field 
work is by nature “human subjects” research, and every research institution and 
funding agency has standards to ensure research subjects are not exploited and that 
researchers behave ethically in the field, and in publishing their research. There has 
been significant development in this area over time, and past research might not 
meet current ethical standards, but it should have met the standards of the time. 
Pseudoethnography, by contrast, is inherently exploitive, even if only through mis­
representation of its subjects.
Napoleon Chagnon and the Yanomami
If the Tasaday example provides an illustration of how nonanthropologists can 
benefit from the intentional misrepresentation of indigenous people, in this 
chapter I examine how actual anthropologists can play a role in pseudoscientific 
constructions. Even given the facts that, as shown in Chapter 2, the Tasaday were 
not a complete hoax, it is true that Elizalde and others, mostly not ethnologists, 
actively portrayed the group as something they were not. This chapter shows 
even trained ethnologists are not immune to letting confirmation bias color their 
interpretations, or of even making up indigenous facts out of whole cloth. I will 
start with one of the most famous anthropological case studies: the Yanomami of 
Amazonian South America (Figure 3.1).
The Yanomami are often presented as the antithesis of the Tasaday. The Tasaday 
supposedly numbered in the dozens, while there are some 35,000 Yanomami 
today. The Tasaday have seen little scientific investigation due to early obstruction 
and later controversy. By comparison the Yanomami are one of the most famous 
and most studied indigenous people. To the extent that nonanthropologists know 
of any indigenous cultures, the Yanomami are quite widely known. This notoriety 
is in part because of the Yanomami’s reputation. While the Tasaday were said to be 
simple, peaceful foragers, the Yanomami were initially framed as organized tribes 
of violent slash and burn farmers. If the Tasaday represented Rouseau’s “noble 
savage” made real, the Yanomami were the embodiment of Hobbs’s savage “state of 
nature”. But, as demonstrated, the Tasaday are far more complex than that stereo­
type. What is the reality of the Yanomami? Why were they deemed “The Fierce 
People” and what are the facts of their existence? I will show that the story of the 
Yanomami is again a story of dueling narratives serving diverse interests that were 
rarely those of the Yanomami.
The Yanomami inhabit the interior rain forest of northern Amazonia along 
the Orinoco River. Their territory is divided between the nation of Brazil and

Venezuela. They traditionally live in walled villages of up to 400 individuals 
and support themselves through shifting field agriculture of plantains and cassava 
supplemented with hunting and foraging. There is significant cultural diversity 
within the category “Yanomami” with four different languages. Villages are 
autonomous, and while adult males are primarily the decisions makers there is 
no institutionalized hierarchy. Anthropological and public attention has focused 
on significant ritual practices, such as the ingestion of hallucinogens, or the 
endocannibalistic consumption of the bones of deceased family members.
Reports of the Yanomami were received by Spanish explorers in the region 
as early as the eighteenth century, but their adaptation to the dense rainforest 
protected them from significant disturbance even as their river-​based neighbors 
were largely annihilated by epidemics and slavery. Sustained contact did not occur 
until the 1950s in the form of Christian missionaries. From the 1960s to 1980s 
the Yanomami were visited by numerous ethnologists who were drawn to the 
group’s relative social and geographic isolation. Essentially the Yanomami in the 
1960s were seen as a real example of what the Tasaday were purported to be in 
the 1970s: a living laboratory to investigate human lifeways in a pristine primitive 
society.

While many anthropologists have investigated various Yanomami groups, none 
is as well-​known as Napoleon Chagnon. The Yanomami first came to international 
attention based on Chagnon’s seminal ethnography initially titled Yanomamo: The 
Fierce People (1968). The polarizing figure of Chagnon, as well as the implications 
of the volume’s subtitle, would have long-​lasting implications for the Yanomami as 
well as many of the ethnologists who have studied them.
Chagnon was a student of the ethnologist Leslie White at the University 
of Michigan. White was mentor to numerous cultural anthropologists and 
archaeologists, and these anthropologists would go on to popularize a theoret­
ical perspective mostly commonly known as cultural materialism. Many volumes 
have been written on this theoretical paradigm, both in support and in critique, 
but it can be summarized as follows. All things being equal, human cultures are 
natural elements in any ecological system. Their culture evolves to adapt to their 
ecological setting in much the same way as organisms adapt. Prominent cultural 
traits exist because they increase the biological fitness, or reproductive success, of 
those individuals who exhibit them. These are essentially functionalist arguments, 
suggesting that all aspects of a culture have a material function in relation to the 
environment. Cultural materialism, under a range of varying names, was a primary, 
if not the primary, explanatory paradigm in cultural, biological and archaeological 
anthropology from the 1960s through the 1970s.
Cultural materialism as a theoretical paradigm is potentially flawed by unstated 
major premises and logical fallacies. Any logical argument must from what is 
already known: premises. These can be axioms (e.g., all men are mortal) but more 
often they are provisional assumptions based on existing data. Sometimes they are 
simply unsupported assumptions. An argument then proceeds via an observation 
(Socrates is a man), and by logically relating those observations to the premises, 
comes to a conclusion (Socrates is mortal). Real science is rarely so convenient as 
the classic syllogism I use here, and real people are rarely as clear and forthright 
in their premises.
If premises are left unstated, or even worse, unstated and erroneous, two 
problems occur. First, the conclusion is likely to be flawed. If you start from a 
flawed premise, it is unlikely that you will come to a true conclusion. Second, two 
individuals who differ significantly in their unstated premises, engaging in a logical 
debate, are unlikely to come to any agreement. They essentially are reading from 
different rulebooks or playing different games entirely.
In the case of the Yanomami, and the cultural perspectives of Chagnon, we 
are not dealing an extreme dislocation in terms of premises, but a close review of 
the premises in question can point to limitations that may have led Chagnon and 
others to erroneous conclusions. The major premise of cultural materialism is that 
cultural traits serve a function. Even in evolutionary theory this is not the case. 
Traits can be maladaptive, and simply not selected against sufficiently to disappear 
from the genome. Traits that are neutral or deleterious can be tied to adaptive 
traits, with the balance being a net positive for fitness. Traits, once adaptive, can be

retained after environmental change has rendered them obsolete, provided they 
are not rendered extremely maladaptive. Even if one accepts the overall theme of 
cultural materialism, one needs to account for the potential for cultural traits that 
may not be actively selected for yet persist due to complex interrelationships with 
the entire suit of cultural practices.
In extreme cases functionalist paradigms take the form of the teleological fal­
lacy. In this fallacy, a system, in this case a human society existing in an ecological 
context, is seen as developing toward a specific goal. There is some foreordained 
end point in the system’s development. In functional terms within anthropology, 
when one argues that a society evolves toward a state of optimum return within 
the environment, one is at least flirting with the teleological fallacy, if not outright 
embracing it.
Chagnon’s work on the Yanomami focused closely on an alleged propensity 
for violence. This violence was perpetrated almost exclusively by adult males, and 
ranged from interpersonal “slapping fights”, through fights with axes or machetes, 
to intervillage raids that could result in serious injuries or death to participants. It 
was difficult to fit this innate violence into a functionalist model, as it seemed any 
behavior that subjected substantial numbers of the young adult (male and female) 
population to lethal threat would be maladaptive and selected against. There 
would be significant critiques of Chagnon’s data, but at the time few questioned 
his observations. They seemed to agree with other evidence indicating a high level 
of violent behavior as a natural part of the human behavioral repertoire, such as 
Jane Goodale’s observations of chimpanzee violence, or Desmond Morris’s The 
Naked Ape.
Chagnon addressed the seeming contradiction by attempting to demonstrate 
that violence was, after all, an adaptive behavior, at least in the Yanomami cul­
tural context. Through detailed analysis of Yanomami marriage patterns, Chagnon 
demonstrated that violence in men had a positive correlation with marriage and 
reproductive success. The more violence a Yanomami man engaged in, the more 
likely he was to find a marriage partner and the more children he was able to 
support. Thus, violent behavior was a net positive contributor to reproductive 
fitness for Yanomami males. This work would lead Chagnon to much acclaim, 
and to this day he is one of the most famous cultural anthropologists. His ethnog­
raphy on the Yanomami would go on to sell over a million copies and become 
a staple of college anthropology courses. Numerous ethnographic films embra­
cing Chagnon’s interpretations were made, including several now regarded as 
classics. Chagnon’s work became a cornerstone of sociobiological interpretations 
of human behavior.
Time would show that what seemed simple (“violence works”) is quite a bit 
more complex. This involves critiques of Chagnon’s research methods, his conduct 
in the field, even his morality, as well as a broader debate regarding the nature of 
violence in human societies. One critic of Chagnon’s Yanomami research has been 
Brian Ferguson (1995, 2001, 2021). Ferguson criticizes Chagnon’s work, and by 
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  51

51
extension the work of all cultural materialists, as ignoring the historical context 
of its subjects:
History must be incorporated for understanding local variation in war and 
gender relations. Women of Chagnon’s area were greatly diminished in 
status relative to men, partly because in an environment highly disturbed by 
circumstances of Western contact, warfare and belligerence became much 
more characteristic of men.
Ferguson 2021:S117
Echoing initial critiques of the characterizations of the Tasaday, Ferguson notes that 
the Yanomami, even while relatively isolated, still experienced European coloni­
alism for centuries. Ferguson argues that the violence exhibited by the Yanomami 
is not innate but is a reaction to the social and economic disruptions of indigenous 
Amazonian cultures.
Ferguson’s research is not specific to the Yanomami but is focused on the 
origins and causes of violence and warfare in general. This is a broad and complex 
field, but it can be summarized. Essentially there have been two approaches. One 
looks at warfare and violence as an innate human adaptation. In any resource-​
stressed environment, a violent individual or violence-​prone population will be 
advantaged over their pacifistic members. You see this perspective espoused in 
the work of Lawrence Keeley, who’s War Before Civilization (1996) referenced 
archaeological evidence of violence as early as the Paleolithic as evidence of war­
fare being humanity’s natural state. Keith Otterbein (2009) and Steven LeBlanc 
(2004) also opt for a functionalist and adaptational view of warfare and violence, 
Otterbein specifically citing the Yanomami as evidence.
Ferguson eschews the functionalist view of warfare as natural and pervasive, 
viewing it as anomalous and a reaction to societal disruption due to contact with 
larger, more powerful societies. War tends to crop up in this “tribal zone” at the 
margins of state power and influence as less complex societies struggle to adapt 
to and interact with expanding state societies (Ferguson and Whitehead 2000). 
For example, Native American tribes in Eastern North America experienced 
a spate of intergroup violence during the Contact and Colonial Periods. This 
was largely spurred by European manipulation of Native populations, who were 
pressured to take sides in European conflicts. Also, Native groups warred on 
each other in order to gain preferred access to European trade goods. Ferguson 
would explain this violence as due to the presence of colonizing European 
powers, rather than any evolutionary propensity for violence on the part of 
Native Americans.
This debate is not sufficient to render Chagnon pseudoscientific in his outlook. 
In fact, proponents of either side of the debate take part in perpetuating another 
common logical fallacy: the false dichotomy. A false dichotomy is presented when­
ever two arguments are erroneously portrayed as being mutually exclusive. In fact, 
 
 
 

52  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology
52
52
if one examines all the available data of any scientific field, it rarely falls neatly into 
two diametrically opposed explanations. Generally, you can find some degree of 
cherry-​picking for each side in a scientific debate, forcing each side into increas­
ingly entrenched opposition and ignoring any middle ground. One is likely to see 
that aspects of both explanations are valid, that both sides are emphasizing different 
elements of a complex phenomenon.
In the case of the example provided, Ferguson would likely endorse the his­
torically contingent explanation based on colonial disruption, while Chagnon 
would likely look for general evolutionary adaptations toward violence on the 
part of Native American cultures. And while this seems to be a dichotomy, in fact 
both would be correct, at least in part. While it is true that some Native American 
cultures did experience increased violence during the contact period, it is also true 
that some did not. The same is true of the Yanomami in fact, as later researchers 
describing Yanomami populations have not identified the same levels of violence 
and have described nonviolent paths to male status (e.g., Ramos 1995). And it 
is also true that archaeological evidence of violence, sometimes quite extreme 
and large-​scale, has been found throughout the Americas, well before the arrival 
of European powers. Applying the same logic to the question of the Yanomami, 
the presence of an adaptive trend toward violence in one indigenous popula­
tion does not rule out violence being exacerbated by colonization, any more 
than colonization-​related violence means that violence was unknown in the pre-​
Contact era.
Chagnon published an autobiographical volume that included a rebuttal to the 
critiques of his interpretations of the Yanomami as culturally adapted to violence 
(Chagnon 2013). In the book he stood by his original interpretations and contests 
the validity of critiques of his work, both professional and ethical (see below). The 
debate between differing scientific interpretations is not in and of itself particu­
larly notable. This is a fact of the human endeavor of science. Even when demon­
strably wrong in terms of facts, proponents of outmoded concepts rarely abandon 
them. Hence the darkly tongue-​in-​cheek aphorism attributed to physicist Max 
Plank: “science advances one funeral at a time”.
What is worth discussing is not the fact that Chagnon stuck to his theoret­
ical guns, but the intellectual strategy he used in doing so. While he did debate 
Ferguson (and many others) in terms of the facts and analyses, he unfortunately also 
falls back onto two closely related logical fallacies in his arguments. One common 
criticism he leveled against most of his critics is that they were operating from a 
“postmodern” philosophy that was inherently nonscientific. Postmodernism was 
a theoretical perspective that developed initially in the field of literary criticism 
in the early twentieth century and was later extended into the social sciences. 
Fundamental to the perspective were the ideas of multi-​vocality, historical con­
tingency, and contextuality. There are often many possible valid interpretations 
and perspectives on any issue, and we have tended to privilege some over others. 
Real, historical events have real, measurable effects on human actions, as much if 
 
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  53

not more so than impersonal trends and forces. The social and historical context 
in which something happens is a major factor in its meaning and interpretation.
Postmodernism has been subjected to justifiable criticism in recent years. 
While it is true that two ethnologists viewing the same culture might come to 
different conclusions, even when referring to empirical data, few have extended 
postmodern concepts to imply that all interpretations are equally valid, and that 
scientific truth is an unobtainable concept. Most scientists respect empirical data, 
even while they acknowledge that differences of opinion are par for the course, 
especially given that most data is incomplete or equivocal. This is especially the 
case in the social and historical sciences. So, when Chagnon criticizes his own 
critics as postmodernist he is essentially constructing a straw man. When he levies 
this charge against specific critics, he is guilty of an ad hominem fallacy. Literally 
meaning “to the man” this is when someone’s argument is discounted not on 
the merits of the argument, but on the identity of the arguer. It doesn’t matter 
whether Brian Ferguson or others are influenced by postmodern ideas, but it 
does matter whether the data they present is accurate and persuasive. Finally, he is 
guilty of poisoning the well, an ad hominem writ large, applied to an entire class 
of people. And saying that all ideas that are postmodernist in any way are by default 
anti-​science is little more than a convenient rationale for avoiding engaging with 
the ideas at all.
It should be pointed out that simply because Chagnon commits several logical 
fallacies in a late career defense of his previous work, does not mean that his work 
was invalid. Discounting someone’s arguments solely based on a logical fallacy is 
itself a fallacy (the aptly named fallacy fallacy). You still must engage with the spe­
cific arguments and data. Ferguson argued that Chagnon ignored the historical 
influence and modern context of colonialism in his arguments. We can now look 
to more significant criticisms that Chagnon may have acted so as to distort the 
actions of his subjects in ways that confirmed his existing hypotheses.
More damaging to Chagnon’s professional reputation were charges leveled by 
Marshall Sahlins, eminent cultural anthropologist and Chagnon’s former mentor. 
Sahlins critiqued Chagnon’s work not on disagreements regarding how one should 
interpret ethnographic data, but on the validity of the data itself. Sahlins noted 
that several practices of Chagnon’s during his field work, which Chagnon him­
self admitted to, fundamentally corrupted his data. To understand Sahlins’ argu­
ment, I must first state something that may seem obvious. Any scientist studying 
any phenomenon must take all possible precautions so that their presence and 
observations do not alter the nature of the phenomenon being studied. Otherwise, 
one risks the “observer effect” where the presence of an observer alters what is 
being observed, so that any conclusions are potentially flawed. Biologists studying 
complex animals, for example, must go through elaborate lengths to either conceal 
themselves from those animals, or to habituate them to their presence. This is espe­
cially critical in cultural anthropology, which is founded on the practice of partici­
pant observation. An anthropologist spends lengthy periods living with the group 
 

54  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology

being studied, participating in their culture as much as is possible, while making 
as little impact on those cultural practices as possible. In this way an anthropolo­
gist should be reasonably assured that what they are observing are “real” cultural 
practices, and not just performances put on for the anthropologist’s benefit.
In Chagnon’s case, he did not abide by these fundamentals of field work with 
the Yanomami. For example, the Yanomami have an ethic of food sharing, which is 
not uncommon among small-​scale cultures. Chagnon refused to participate, which 
likely engendered bewildered resentment in his hosts, and marked him as an out­
sider, precluding the “honorary member” status that cultural ethnologists depend 
on. Even more alarming were Chagnon’s practice of compensating subjects for 
data (blood samples, interviews, genealogical data) with manufactured items such 
as machetes. This likely caused envy and resentment between those who were 
benefiting from Chagnon’s presence and those that were not. It even may have 
exacerbated the very violence that was central to Chagnon’s interpretations.
Finally, Sahlins points out that Chagnon made little to no effort to explore 
disconfirming evidence, in that he never explored other possible explanations 
for male reproductive success besides violence. He may have demonstrated a 
correlation between reproductive success and violent behavior, but he did not 
demonstrate that this correlation was causative in nature. This leaves Chagnon’s 
interpretations open to another logical fallacy: “cum hoc ergo propter hoc” or 
“during, therefore because of”. It is a common heuristic to assume events that 
co-​occur or follow one another must be linked, as it is safer to assume the false 
positive of a link and be wrong than to assume the false negative of coincidence. 
But when it comes to scientific investigations, variables that co-​occur must be 
explored further to prove a causal link.
The most controversial incident in Chagnon’s career came with the publi­
cation of Darkness in El Dorado (Tierney 2000). This volume makes similar 
allegations as had Ferguson and Sahlins, essentially that shoddy fieldwork and 
scientific practices rendered Chagnon’s work problematic. Far more sensational, 
however, were claims that Chagnon and other collaborators committed significant 
ethical violations in their fieldwork, most notably that they had contributed to 
a measles outbreak among the Yanomami. Chagnon retired soon after. However, 
multiple independent investigations have found these claims to be exaggerated 
(see Shermer 2001 for a detailed discussion). It is unclear if these criticisms of 
Chagnon were simply a result of confirmation bias, critics having decided on their 
villains in advance and interpreting the evidence to support that conclusion. It is 
also likely that Chagnon’s existing notoriety predisposed critics to be less critical 
of the allegations. Again, confirmation bias: if you already thought Chagnon was 
a less than laudable researcher, you were likely primed to believe any unflattering 
allegations about him.
Where, then, does Chagnon’s work among the Yanomami stand on the con­
tinuum of scientific ethnography to pseudoethnography? The research, and the 
researcher (perhaps more so the latter) are obviously controversial. Chagnon’s 
 
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  55

name is widely recognized not on the strength of his research, but on personal 
notoriety. However, controversy alone does not invalidate scientific research. It is 
possible to be controversial and still be a good scientist, and to generate ideas and 
data that are legitimate. To write off his work based solely its negative associations 
would be its own ad hominem. It is also true that Chagnon was largely working 
for a functionalist and materialist paradigm that has been widely criticized in 
anthropological literature. Humans are cognitively and behaviorally more com­
plex than any other animal, and to expect their behavior to be explained based 
on relatively simple premises is unreasonable. However, again, working under a 
theoretical paradigm that has been critiqued, and may even be seriously flawed, 
does not by itself indicate pseudoscience. All science should be critiqued, and so 
long as a scientist is collecting data in good faith and working within the best 
understanding at the time in their field, they are doing legitimate science, even if 
it is eventually proven to be factually false.
The allegations that Chagnon essentially bought data from Yanomami 
informants with manufactured goods, and that he did not conduct himself in the 
field in a manner keeping with best practices, are troubling. But, while this is per­
haps grounds for critiquing and discounting some of his arguments, it doesn’t put 
his work outside of the bounds of science. It was, perhaps, not very good science, 
but still science. Finally, the most controversial critiques of Chagnon’s work, of 
extreme malpractice, have been discredited. It is unfortunate that, due to “source 
amnesia”, most people will remember the negative stories, and forget that he was 
exonerated. In that regards he is a victim of yet another cognitive heuristic. We 
remember controversy and forget or ignore its resolution.
Going back to the idea of the demarcation problem, how to distinguish science 
from nonscience, based on the facts as laid out I would have to put Chagnon’s 
work on the science side of the demarcation line, if only just. My next case study 
involves a case that clearly falls in the realm of pseudoscience.
Carlos Castaneda and the Myth of Don Juan
A major focus in anthropology is the study of human universals: patterns of 
behavior that all humans engage in, regardless of historical, geographical, or 
cultural context. One universal rarely remarked upon in modern anthropo­
logical discourse but once a widespread topic of study is the use of intoxi­
cating drugs.
Most of this research took placed during the 1960s and 1970s, a time when 
drug use, especially of psychedelics, played a major role in popular consciousness. 
Writers and pop culture figures such as Aldous Huxley, Ken Kesey, or Timothy 
Leary had created awareness of hallucinogenic drug culture in the United States 
and beyond. Despite the popular appeal of the topic, much of this research was 
academically rigorous and made significant contributions to our understanding 
of human behavior. The work of such figures as Weston La Barre, or Richard 
 
 

56  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology
56
56
Schultes are seminal ethnographic studies that happen to include drug use as cen­
tral themes.
However, by the 1980s such research was on the wane, and it is only in rela­
tively recent years that we see it making a comeback. There are many reasons for 
this, notably the counterreaction against the hedonistic excesses of the 1960s and 
1970s during the “just say no” 1980s. Despite the reaction against drugs, drug use 
didn’t go away any more than it was universally accepted earlier, just tastes and 
drugs of choice changed. Psychedelic hallucinogens were out of fashion in com­
parison to designer drugs or cocaine. But I think one must look beyond historical 
trends in drug use and societal reactions to drug use to understand the anthropo­
logical rejection of the topic. A large part of this rejection of drug use as a topic 
of anthropological research is due to one controversial figure: Carlos Castaneda.
The study of hallucinogens has been a contentious field. While there has 
been much quality scholarly work, some has crossed the line between objective 
research and fictionalized sensationalism. Among the least credible are the writings 
of Castaneda. In 1968, Castaneda, a graduate student in anthropology at the 
University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), published a popular book: The 
Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge. His third book, Journey to Ixtlan, 
was submitted as a dissertation to UCLA in 1973 for which he was awarded a 
doctorate in anthropology (Fikes 2021:4). In these books and nine more to follow 
Castaneda wrote a supposedly autobiographical tale that told of his training in the 
arts of shamanism. According to his story, he was approached by a Yaqui shaman 
known as Don Juan who selected Castaneda to receive his teaching. Through 
consuming peyote and other drugs under Don Juan’s guidance, Castaneda learned 
to transcend his physical self and communicate with spiritual beings. The books 
became popular among the counterculture of the late 1960s and the later New 
Age movement. They were extolled as literary and scholastic masterpieces by 
popular media as well as leading intellectuals and academics.
Despite the scholarly and popular enthusiasm for Castaneda’s writing, serious 
reservations were raised. The books are riddled with textual inconsistencies and 
contradictions (Fikes 2021:5–​7). Nobody could attest to the whereabouts or exist­
ence of the titular Don Juan, and there is ample reason to suspect there never 
was any such individual. Whatever his faults as a researcher, Castaneda clearly had 
substantial knowledge of Mesoamerican indigenous cultures. The most plausible 
explanation for his writing is that he stitched a pastiche of beliefs and practices 
from numerous Native groups, which he then embodied in the person of a fic­
tional character, writing himself into resulting narrative. Fikes (1993:49) quotes a 
friend of Castaneda from UCLA: “Carlos Castaneda is the greatest psychic fraud 
of the twentieth century”. De Mille (1990:354) called Castaneda a “transparent 
fraud”.
Upon investigation, further discrepancies in Castaneda’s narrative became 
apparent. His descriptions of peyote hallucinations did not correspond to the 
experiences of informants. The “trips” described were far too intense and visionary 
 
 
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  57
56
57
for the known effects of peyote. It was often unclear what drugs the characters 
were allegedly ingesting, and thus it was impossible to confirm the accuracy of the 
depictions. His earlier books cite the use of jimsonweed and psilocybin “magic” 
mushrooms as opposed to peyote (Fikes 2021:37). This amounts to a researcher 
not bothering to record vital, basic information regarding their subjects, but makes 
sense if the entire narrative was fictional.
Richard De Mille (1976, 1990) has been the most prominent critic of 
Castaneda’s writing. De Mille painstakingly noted inconsistencies between 
Castaneda’s narratives and known facts. On many occasions he claims to have 
been in places or with informants when there is documented evidence of him 
being elsewhere. Since his writing was purported to be ethnographic research, 
misrepresenting his interactions with informants was essentially falsifying his 
research data. Also, De Mille noted instances of ignorance of practices that no real 
ethnologist would exhibit. He describes smoking psilocybin mushrooms, which 
are generally eaten. Essentially De Mille documented that Castaneda’s narrative 
hangs on events and practices that could not have occurred.
Even more concerning was that the group Castaneda claimed to have interacted 
with, the Yaqui, were not known to have had any significant tradition of peyote 
use. The Yaqui were primarily Catholic and did not have a significant tradition of 
religious peyote use. Experts on Yaqui lifeways pointed out upon the publication 
of his first book that the culture and figure he describes bear little to no resem­
blance to real Yaqui (Figure 3.2).
The lifeways Castaneda described were more consistent with a different Native 
American group entirely, the Huichol. Also living in Northern Mexico, the 
Huichol have a religious system that makes extensive use of hallucinogens such 
as peyote, as well as jimsonweed and Indian tobacco (see Rafferty 2021). The 
Huichol had been the subject of anthropological research, most notably by Peter 
Furst and Barbara Myerhoff. Both Furst and Myerhoff were early supporters of 
Castaneda, and Castaneda would have been familiar with their research on the 
Huichol.
Also, while Castaneda was not himself a Huichol ethnologist, he did have 
interactions while at UCLA with other students who were not only ethnologists 
of the Huichcol but were themselves Huichol. Fikes (1993:51) argues that these 
relationships were opportunities for Castaneda to learn enough Huichol culture 
to pass himself off as a true ethnographer of indigenous Mexican culture.
This last issue once again brings up a fundamental issue of skepticism, the 
issue of prior plausibility. Had Castaneda claimed to have conducted research with 
Huichol practitioners, his claim would have been plausible, and might not have 
come under such scrutiny. But by claiming they were Yaqui, he was making a far 
less plausible claim, one requiring more evidentiary support than the uncorrobor­
ated anecdotes he provided in his books. If his claims were untrue, then the choice 
of the Yaqui makes more sense given the greater familiarity of anthropologists 
with the Huichol.

Had he described Don Juan as Huichol, other researchers would have likely 
been curious how such a significant and powerful shaman had escaped their aca­
demic scrutiny only to be discovered by a single graduate student. Don Juan bears 
a strong resemblance to a real Huichol, Ramón Medina Silva, who had been a 
subject of Furst and Myerhoff, and who was murdered in 1971 (Fikes 1993:1). 
Castaneda knew Silva; the two were friends. Silva was portrayed as a Huichol 
Shaman by Furst and Myerhoff. It is plausible that the hero of Castaneda’s books 
FIGURE 3.2 Yaqui Indians. Source: Library of Congress, USA, public domain
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  59
58
59
was a fiction based on a dead man. At least one other figure in Castaneda’s books, a 
sorcerer named Don Genero, was also likely based in part on Silva (Fikes 1993:70).
Experts in indigenous Mexican cultures made requests to Castaneda to see 
his field notes, the original data on which he was supposedly basing his writing. 
These requests were ignored. A fundamental aspect of science is the free sharing 
of data (after a researcher has had a reasonable amount of time to publish their 
interpretations). Failure or refusal to do so is an attempt to circumvent part of the 
peer review process, indicating a researcher has little faith in their own data, that 
the data contradicts their published interpretations, or that there may be no actual 
data to begin with. De Mille (1990:61) characterizes Castaneda’s unwillingness to 
share field notes as “prima facie evidence of fraud”.
This is especially damning in someone claiming to be an academic. While the 
academic peer-​review system is designed to ensure the quality of research, it is 
not well designed to ferret out outright fraud. There is a sizeable element of trust 
between academic researchers: “Professional anthropologists regularly assume the 
reports provided by their colleagues are reliable…authenticity of data derived 
from research is normally taken for granted” (Fikes 1993:151). Each published 
piece of research builds upon those that came before, and publishing fraudulent 
material means that anything that comes after, which references that material, 
is also flawed. The example of Piltdown Man, discussed in the opening chapter, 
illustrates this point. Despite obvious issues with the discovery in hindsight, it 
was viewed as a legitimate human ancestor for over 40 years. Such incidences 
do damage to academia beyond the effect of any one study. It is a fundamental 
violation of professional trust that does damage to the entire system of academic 
inquiry.
Given these significant shortcomings in Castaneda’s research, this next issue 
feels almost an afterthought, but speaks to his overall credibility. Whatever his 
faults as a scholar, Castaneda was clearly well-​read. Unfortunately, part of the 
reason we know he read extensively is that many of his pithiest statements in his 
books bear a startling similarity to the writings of other scholars, including leading 
anthropologists such as Furst and Myerhoff, as well as prominent philosophers, 
even the novelist C. S. Lewis. Essentially Castaneda was apparently not only guilty 
of passing off his fictionalized stories as factual scholarship, but also of serial pla­
giarism (Fikes 2021:7).
Following his ascent to international fame, it was found that there was little 
Castaneda had been honest about. Once lauded by Time magazine, the same outlet 
later ran a story that illustrated multiple lies Castaneda had told regarding his own 
past (Burton 1973). He claimed to be Brazilian but was born to unmarried parents 
in Peru. He claimed to have served in the military but had not. He was ten years 
older than he claimed. He claimed his father to be a well-​known Brazilian aca­
demic, but in fact he was a Peruvian watchmaker. His mother had died when he 
was 24, but he claimed it had happened when he was only 6. Castaneda’s own past 
proved to be as constructed as his writing. And while lying about one’s past is not 
 
 

60  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology
60
60
in itself enough to discredit later academic work, it presents a pattern of dissem­
blance that does little to support his work’s credibility.
Castaneda’s career proved controversial, to say the least. Some have argued his 
claims to merely be highly embellished; others have concluded they were out­
right fraud (Fikes 1993). Others have maintained Castaneda’s authenticity. Michael 
Harner, Prem Das, and Brant Secunda have been described as “Castaneda partisans” 
(Fikes 1993:144). A compromise position argues that Castaneda’s shaman char­
acter may not have existed per se but serves as a valuable literary and metaphorical 
figure (Bletzer 1977.
This compromise, however, ignores the fact that Castaneda presented his work 
as factual, when even the most charitable interpretation shows it to be substan­
tially fictionalized. To be blunt, when you claim one thing is something it is not, 
you are lying, and this alone renders Castaneda’s writings highly problematic. Fikes 
(1993:55) puts it best: “Finding ethnography in Castaneda’s books is almost as 
laborious as panning for gold”. The books became less fact-​based over time after 
the first three volumes, presumably as the author exhausted his store of factual or 
at least plausible information.
Most anthropologists of the time seemed willing to, if not endorse 
Castaneda’s work, at least not directly confront it. But several significant figures 
did voice criticisms, including Edmund Leach and Weston La Barre. La Barre, 
in an unpublished review of Castaneda’s second book, termed it a “pseudo-​
profound, deeply vulgar pseudo-​ethnography” (Fikes 1993:101). Gordon 
Wasson, an expert on the use of psychedelic fungi, posted a damning critique 
and noted that Castaneda describes Don Juan as a native of northern Mexico, 
and also describes the man as an expert in the use of psilocybin mushrooms, 
which grow in southern Mexico.
When confronted with this contradiction, Castaneda embellished Don Juan’s 
origin story with facts curiously missing from his first book; now he was Sonoran 
but had been deported at some point to the south. This is essentially special pleading, 
where criticisms of a claim are dismissed by ad hoc and generally unfalsifiable add­
itional claims. Even this redirection of criticism fails to hold up under scrutiny; while 
some Yaqui were deported south, they maintained their traditional lifeways, so it 
is implausible that a Yaqui would take up foreign religious practices as Castaneda 
suggests. The resulting composite figure of Don Juan is essentially a “cheap version 
of an archetypical trickster” (Fikes 1993:61), too complex to be believable. Fikes goes 
on to compare Castaneda to von Däniken, another pseudoscientific fraudster popular 
during the same time as Castaneda’s initial publications (see Chapter 7).
What, specifically, were the effects of the disclosure of Castaneda’s fecklessness 
on Castaneda himself? Professionally, in terms of anthropology, we can at least say 
it had career-​ending effects. He never held a formal academic position, though 
it’s not clear if he ever sought one. One could convincingly argue that, if his 
Ph.D. dissertation was based on the same fraudulent data as his published books, 
then his degree was essentially invalid, a view that likely held among his critics.
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  61
60
61
Personally, the effects were also significant. He withdrew totally from public 
life, surrounding himself with acolytes and sycophants, but did not interact with 
his accusers. Financially, the effect was, if anything, positive. His fraud was largely 
exposed after his fourth book, but he published numerous volumes after that, 
which sold well and continue to do so. His 15 published works have sold at 
least 8 million copies, in over a dozen languages. At the time of this writing, The 
Teachings of Don Juan ranks 8,570 on Amazon.com, and features on many of the 
online retailer’s top ten lists. Castaneda’s mendacity has clearly been of financial 
benefit to him, and to his estate.
Other personal effects were less fortunate, if not for him, then for others associated 
with him (Marshall 2007). Following the 1973 Time magazine story, he no longer 
interacted with the press or allowed himself to be photographed. He moved to Los 
Angeles, and severed ties with his ex-​wife and child. He established himself with 
a group of young women he termed “the witches” in LA, collectively living in 
a compound. Over the following decades, others moved into the compound, the 
group developing into what could be described as a cult. Members were told to cut 
all ties with their past and take new names. Many became socially and financially 
dependent on the group, though members could be banished at Castaneda’s whim. 
The guiding principles of the group were eventually given the name “tensegrity” 
which has been described as a mish mash of Native American spirituality and Asian 
martial arts concepts and practices. Castaneda died of liver cancer in 1998.
As with any fraudulent episode in science, we must ask why it was perpetuated, 
to what degree it was accepted as valid, and why. In the case of Castaneda, his 
motivations remain obscure. Once the invalidity of his work was publicized, he 
did not engage his critics, withdrawing and continuing to publish. We can specu­
late that the fame, professional renown, and financial rewards were all motivating 
factors. And as with many fraudsters, when one reads of Castaneda’s interactions 
with his fellow graduate students, his professors, indigenous Mexicans, and the 
public, one gets a sense of a sociopathic manipulator. This element certainly comes 
through in his later years.
Fikes (1993:96–​100) describes Castaneda as a “bullshitter”, working from a 
definition of that vulgar but apt term provided by Frankfurt (1986). I refer the 
reader to Frankfurt’s original article, which is useful reading for any critical thinker. 
A bullshitter is different from a liar. A liar presents a knowingly nonfactual account 
to achieve a goal. Frankfurt and Fikes note that a bullshitter, while including 
nonfactual information in their accounts, is not so much lying as not seeing the 
distinction between true and false as relevant. It’s the resulting narrative that is 
important to a bullshitter, as well as the immediate reaction to that narrative. This 
goes a long way to explain the complex intermixture of truth, falsehood, and true 
but misleading statements that make up Castaneda’s work. Perhaps his goal was not 
to sell lies, but to present a compelling story as if it were true without concern that 
large parts of it were not. It is interesting to note that Castaneda himself referred 
to himself as a “bullshitter” (Fikes 1993:96).
 
 

62  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology
62
62
As for the degree to which his work was accepted as valid, with some not­
able exceptions, it was largely deemed invalid by most anthropologists by the late 
1970s. Even some nonanthropologists, such as the novelist Joyce Carol Oates, 
decried the obvious fiction as early as 1972 (Marshall 2007).
What can we say about the effect of Castaneda’s writing on anthropology as a 
discipline? On the one hand, he did bring substantial attention to cultural anthro­
pology. If you were to ask a knowledgeable nonanthropologist to name a famous 
anthropologist, it is probable even today that Castaneda’s name would come up, 
and in the 1970s he was as widely known as Margaret Meade was in the 1950s. It 
is reasonable to assume that some appreciable number of anthropologists got their 
initial experience to the field through reading Castaneda, much as many profes­
sional archaeologists learned of archaeology through Indiana Jones.
However, much as Dr. Jones makes a terrible model for a real archaeologist, the 
version of anthropology one absorbs in Castaneda’s writing is distorted beyond 
recognition. Castaneda misrepresents anthropologists as totally un-​objective in 
research. While Chagnon at times tried to maintain scientific rigor in his work, 
Castaneda throws objectivity away entirely. He doesn’t participate in the culture, 
he claims to become part of the culture, to take on the role of a ritual practi­
tioner as Don Juan’s apprentice. While the line between researcher and subject 
can be blurry at times, such being the nature of participant observation, Castaneda 
purported to eradicate the line entirely. It is something of a blessing his work was 
fictional; had it been real he would have been guilty of extraordinary professional 
misconduct.
Some of Castaneda’s readers were not willing to experience his version of Native 
spirituality vicariously, seeking to travel to Huichol territory and/​or experience 
the same hallucinogenic experience he describes. This presented real hazard to 
such individuals. Americans entering Mexico for the purpose of acquiring peyote 
ran afoul of Mexican law enforcement. Some sought and acquired other drugs 
Castaneda (and later New Age writers) described, such as jimsonweed, which can 
be lethally toxic, or bufotenine toad secretions, which are toxic and illegal. In cre­
ating a fictional narrative that exoticized Native practices, Castaneda put both the 
Natives, as well as their American admirers, in real danger.
Despite the poor quality of Castaneda’s work it remains hugely popular among 
the general public. There are several reasons for this general popularity. First, even 
though most professional anthropologists were aware of the fictional nature of 
Castaneda’s books from soon after their publication, there was no systematic 
and robust effort on their part to inform the public. This was a time when sci­
entific professions typically made minimal efforts to inform the public of their 
own work, so this is not surprising. Second, there is what we can call originality 
bias: people tend to remember initial information and ignore or not recall later 
refutations. Third, there is what has been termed popularity bias (or the “argument 
ad populum”), the bandwagon effect, or the Barnum effect: popular ideas are often 
accepted uncritically simply on the basis of their popularity. Fourth, the additional 
 
 

Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology  63
62
63
logical fallacy of the argument from authority, where a claim is deemed errone­
ously valid based purely on the authority of the claimant, likely played a role in the 
acceptance of Castaneda’s work. So far as most people knew, he was a legitimate 
Ph.D.-​credentialed anthropologist publishing an expert nonfiction account.
Finally, there is the preference for narrative over fact: most people prefer a good 
story over an often-​unfulfilling truth. Scientists seeking to draw public attention 
away from fraudulent or inaccurate narratives are advised to frame their refutation 
in the form of a more compelling narrative, rather than just to provide contrary 
but easily ignored facts. For example, focusing on the degree to which Castaneda 
exploited the trust of his informants, or his own rise and fall as an anthropologist, 
would have made for a possibly effective counternarrative. Even then, it is likely 
that Castaneda would still have garnered a substantial following as he had tapped 
into a deep human need: “For some, emotional needs for self-​transcendence (some 
will say escapism) and larger than life personalities may overpower the capacity 
for critical thinking. They may well be involved in constructing a quasi-​religion, 
one originally founded by the charismatic Castaneda” (Fikes 1993:144). The fact 
that his books sold well likely also protected him as there was motivation to pro­
tect him from exposure. For example, in 1972 the New York Times elected not to 
publish a highly critical review by Weston La Barre, a scholar of indigenous use of 
psychoactive drugs (Fikes 2021:9–​10).
In such situations, where a scientific hoax is perpetrated, we should direct some 
attention toward the motivation of the hoaxer: why was the hoax created in the 
first place? What were the motivations of the hoaxer? Knowing this can explain 
what happened and can help a critical viewer recognize a hoax in the first place.
Hoaxes are performed for numerous reasons. Personal enrichment is one, such 
as Elizalde enjoyed through fabricated elements of the Tasaday culture. Professional 
reputation is another, such as was bestowed on Dawson prior to the exposure of 
the Piltdown Man hoax. Other hoaxes might derive gratification from fooling 
experts. Some, in what is known as a “pious fraud” will fake evidence of some­
thing they believe to be true, but lack concrete evidence of, such as someone 
who believes bigfoot to exist creating fake bigfoot footprints to sway scientific 
consensus.
In some cases, the motivations behind a hoax are ambiguous, such being the 
case with Castaneda. While it is true he did benefit financially from the Don Juan 
hoax, it is not clear if that was his primary goal. Professional renown is a more 
likely explanation as he did receive a Ph.D., but this does not really explain why 
he persisted. Since he gave no explanations of his work after 1973, his motives 
will likely remain obscure. I would speculate that, given he was known to be a 
serial liar about all aspects of his life, it was a matter of personal inclination. In 
this case, it may actually be a mistake to look for any particular motive behind 
Castaneda’s hoax.
We also need to reflect on the effect of Castaneda’s writing on its purported 
subjects: the Yaqui, Huichol, and other indigenous groups of Mexico. On the 
 

64  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology
64
64
positive side, his books brought these cultures to public attention, and much as 
was the case for anthropology in general, they likely drove additional academic 
research into these societies. Likewise, Castaneda’s writing was probably the first 
time most people in developed nations heard of the concept of shamanism, a way 
of belief that has existed for hundreds of thousands of years prior to the develop­
ment of organized religions.
However, again the overall effect was negative. Readers were not exposed to 
authentic lifeways or religious practices, but to a version that had been crafted 
for popularity. Natives were exoticized into spiritually enlightened others, whose 
values and lifeways were ideologically in agreement with American countercul­
ture. The public came to expect this bastardized version of traditional cultures, 
and the weight of tourist dollars meant many indigenous cultures to some degree 
changed to meet these expectations. Culture is always performative, but usually it 
is an internal audience, not rich outsiders, that one is performing for. Even those 
maintaining traditional lifestyles often found themselves the target of harassment 
and incarceration by outsiders and law enforcement as a result of the publicity 
arising from Castaneda’s writing. Many of these tourists came to Huichol territory 
to acquire peyote themselves, damaging local supplies of the plant and incurring 
negative attention from local authorities (Fikes 2021:8).
Nor did the Native cultures benefit significantly in any economic sense. Those 
Huichol who still live in Native territories in Mexico are largely employed in the 
tobacco industry for low wages, and suffer exposure to pollution and pesticides. 
The dire economic contexts of the subject of even legitimate anthropological 
research has long been criticized as a “blind spot” (Fikes 1993:131) and led in 
recent decades to the practice of development anthropology, where ethnologists 
sought to actively better the lives of the people they studied. Such a concern was 
absent entirely from the work of Castaneda. The only parties that seem to have 
benefitted in any tangible way from Castaneda’s books are Castaneda himself and 
his estate after his death. The public readership was hoaxed and misinformed; the 
anthropological community was besmirched, and the indigenous community was 
exploited.
Bad Anthropology, Pseudo-​Anthropology, Hoax Anthropology
In the works of Napoleon Chagnon and Carlos Castaneda, we see the full range 
of problematic anthropology research. Chagnon came from a distinguished aca­
demic pedigree, and his research was largely in keeping with the theoretical para­
digm of the time. However, while a scientist’s questions should be guided by 
theory, in Chagnon’s case it seems that the questions and worse, the answers, were 
determined by theory-​driven expectations. It seems he acted in ways that affected 
the outcome of his research, creating the situation he expected to find.
Castaneda represents a worst-​case scenario for cultural anthropology. People 
can disagree with Chagnon’s approach, behavior, and interpretations, but would

still consider him an anthropologist. Castaneda actively mislead the public and 
other researchers, needlessly exoticized Native cultures in the minds of his readers, 
feeding into colonialist racism. His work threatened the basic credibility of cul­
tural anthropology.
In keeping with the skeptical principles of this volume, we should ask what 
logical fallacies, cognitive biases, or cultural factors played roles in the three case 
studies from this chapter. Unsurprisingly, each one features a sizeable influence 
of confirmation bias, where information confirming the expectations of various 
parties was uncritically accepted, and disconfirming evidence was either not 
sought or was ignored. Chagnon expected to find violence among the Yanomami, 
and then did so, so it never occurred to him to what degree he himself was cre­
ating that behavior. Castaneda’s readers, both professional and lay, saw versions of 
Native peoples that they expected to see, that agreed with their own anthropo­
logical interpretations, or which met with the cultural expectations of the psyche­
delic counterculture that bought so many of his books.
Appeals to authority also played a role in each case study, with poorly framed 
or illegitimate ideas being accepted uncritically based on the status of the claimant. 
Chagnon was a significant figure in cultural anthropology. For many anthropology 
students, Chagnon was one of their first introductions to ethnographic writing. 
Such status buys a scientist a lot of credibility, and unfortunately this can lead to 
published work not being as critically evaluated as would that of a less established 
scholar.
An argument could be made that Castaneda also prospered through a form 
of the appeal to authority. He did have a Ph.D. from an esteemed anthropology 
department, and the support of esteemed colleagues. As a non-​American, Peruvian-​
posing-​as-​Brazilian, he may have been seen as being more “authentic” than white 
anthropologists. His own attempts to present himself as “honorary other” through 
his alleged adoption by the fictitious Don Juan, show how he himself leaned into 
this status. It is likely that, had he been a white American, his hoax would not have 
been as successful. So, by nature of his credentials, his ambiguous ancestry, and his 
personal presentation, he likely evaded professional and popular criticism.
Both figures benefitted from appeals to popularity as well. Castaneda is still 
a profitable author, years after his death. Chagnon was long a staple of college 
anthropology classes. In such situations, where ideas are widely held and popular, 
it is easy for most to assume there must be something to them. But as we have 
seen in both case studies, one was flawed, the other fraudulent. Popularity is no 
substitute for scientific substance.
Last, we can consider the effect of a common psychological bias, the funda­
mental attribution error. When committing this fallacy, one emphasizes the role 
of internal factors over external factors when interpreting another’s behavior. This 
is an error of essentialization, where one applies simplistic causation to complex 
behavior. When interpreting the actions of another, we are prone to explaining 
them based on their perceived nature, rather than their circumstances. If someone 
 

66  Ethnology vs. Pseudoethnology
66
66
steals, we assume it is because they are by nature a thief, rather than considering 
what temporary circumstances might have led to their thievery.
This bias is particularly relevant for Chagnon’s case. The original subtitle for his 
ethnography of the Yanomami was “The Fierce People”. When viewing instances 
of violence, he concluded that they were a violent people by nature as an adap­
tation to their environment. This was a fundamental attribution error writ large, 
applied to an entire culture. What he failed to consider was that there were external 
circumstances that exacerbated violence among the Yanomami, circumstances he 
himself had a hand in creating. Castaneda committed a similar fallacy when he 
wrote of a “Yaqi way of knowledge”, as if a heterogeneous and complex society 
could be said to have a single way of anything. This one logical error of attrib­
uting simplistic internal causes over complex external circumstances is of par­
ticular relevance to anthropology, where the concept of a “culture” predisposes us 
to see homogeneity and ignore internal diversity in our subjects. Chagnon and 
Castaneda are just particularly egregious examples.
Moving from pseudoanthropology in the cultural anthropology subfield, we 
now turn to the consideration of nonscientific applications of linguistics, the study 
of human symbolic communication.

APES AND SIGN LANGUAGE
Another “Clever Hans”?
Clever Hans was a horse (Figure 4.1). A horse that could do complex math. Hans 
was a sensation in early twentieth-​century Germany and was widely held to show 
animals were not so different from humans in their intellectual capacity. Hans 
could perform a variety of calculations, stamping his hoof to communicate the 
answer. He could perform this feat regardless of who asked the questions. Not 
limited to matters mathematical, Hans could communicate complex sentences, his 
numbered hoof stomps corresponding to letters on a numbered board.
Even a mildly skeptical reader would suspect something amiss from this story, 
and they would be right to do so. Eventually Hans was put to a controlled test, 
where the questioner was separated from Hans before the answer was given. In 
the absence of anyone who knew the correct answer, Hans was unable to answer. 
Hans’s gift was not linguistic or mathematical, but observational. He was very good 
a picking up subtle cues from his questioner, and from these unconscious cues he 
could intuit when he was supposed to stop stomping. Horses are social animals, 
and are attuned to subtle cues of behavior. This is amazing by itself, showing the 
complexity of social behavior in higher mammals, but was not evidence of preter­
natural ability. We now call this phenomenon, where a questioner unconsciously 
gives away the answer, the “Clever Hans effect” (Novella et al. 2018).
The story of Clever Hans is relevant to the study of language in its implications 
for one of the more sensational and controversial linguistic questions: can non­
human primates be taught to communicate with humans using sign language?
The study of the linguistic potential of great apes started with a series of reason­
able and plausible scientific questions. Can apes be taught use sign language? What 
can the study of ape language abilities teach us about the development of language 
in children? Is language uniquely human, or is there a language instinct widely 
distributed among anthropoids? If so, what are the similarities and differences 
 
 

68  Apes and Sign Language

between the linguistic abilities of humans and great apes? The answers to most 
of these questions are still unresolved, after over 50 years of research. Several case 
studies reveal the complexity of the issues, the challenges in addressing them, and, 
unfortunately, a fair amount of pseudoscience.
The first significant experiment in ape signing started in 1966 with a wild 
female chimpanzee named Washoe. From the age of ten months, Washoe was 
given into the care of a team led by Beatrix and Allen Gardner with the goal 
of teaching her to sign. She was always in the presence of a human researcher, 
and communication with the ape was conducted using American Sign Language 
(ASL). By the end of the project, researchers claimed Washoe had learned about 
350 signs, could use them spontaneously or in combinations to express concepts, 
and had taught signs to other chimpanzees.
To replicate the results obtained with Washoe, another chimpanzee, named 
“Nim Chimpsky” (after famed linguist and social activist Noam Chomsky) was 
also exposed to ASL for approximately four years. Research on Nim was led by 
Herbert Terrace (Terrace et al. 1979). After four years, the ape could use 125 
signs, a less impressive achievement than was claimed with Washoe. The distinction 
between the findings of the two projects goes beyond the difference in the size of 
the respective vocabularies. While it was claimed that Washoe could use signs in 
combination with the appearance of organized grammar, this was not replicated 
with Nim. Nim could assign meaning to individual signs and communicate his 
wishes to some degree but could not form sentences. This led to conflict between 
the two research teams, with those researching Washoe arguing Nim was not 
raised in a sufficiently natural social setting (specifically that there were numerous

69
caregivers), whereas Washoe was raised essentially as a human child. At the same 
time researchers studying Nim questioned the grammatical ability of Washoe, 
arguing it was only responding to conditioned responses, and that Washoe’s 
handlers were engaging in confirmation bias and cherry-​picking: counting signs 
or combinations that indicated competence, but ignoring errors.
A more recent ape communication study has focused on a female bonobo 
named Kanzi (Figure 4.2). Research on Kanzi was led by Sue Savage-​Rumbaugh 
(1994, 1998). Unlike Washoe or Nim, Kanzi’s language training focuses on the 
use of a computerized lexigram board. Through this method Kanzi was said to 
know several hundred signs, be able to use them in combinations both to express 
concepts, and also to respond to questions at a level approximately that of a human 
two-​year-​old. Kanzi was said to have taught other bonobos to communicate via 
the same method, and to have learned some degree of ASL.
By far the best-​known example of ape communication was a female gorilla 
named Koko. Koko was taught a modified ASL by Francine “Penny” Patterson, 
herself a student of the Gardner’s. Patterson claimed that Koko knew over 1,000 
signs and understood some 2,000 words of spoken English. As with Washoe, there 
has been substantial dispute about the degree to which Koko understood lan­
guage. Patterson claimed Koko was capable of advanced linguistic expression, 
including syntax, emotional expression, and knowledge of self. Critics claimed

that Koko was exhibiting operant conditioning and had little actual understanding 
of what was being said.
The studies of Washoe, Kanzi, Nim, and Koko have come under criticism. 
Probably the most outspoken and prominent figures in this critique is the linguist 
and social activist Noam Chomsky, and linguist and cognitive scientist Steven 
Pinker. Pinker and Chomsky focus on different aspects of ape research, but broadly 
agree that what we are seeing is not actual language, but complex mimicry. In a 
2007 interview (chomsky.info) Chomsky stated:
If … Nim had succeeded, we would still have learned nothing about lan­
guage acquisition, gaining neither more nor less wonderment, though we 
would have a biological problem. Namely, if apes have this fantastic capacity, 
surely a major component of humans’ extraordinary biological success (in 
the technical sense), then how come they haven’t used it?
Chomsky here is essentially noting that it defies principles of evolutionary theory 
that an organism would exhibit a complex, physiologically expensive adaptation 
like language, and yet never use it in their natural habitat. The work of such fig­
ures as Diane Fossey and Jane Goodall has shown us how much more complex 
great ape societies are than we had imagined, but in none of their observations, 
or in any other ape researcher, have we seen language ability in the wild. It strains 
belief to think that nature would allow a latent ability to lie dormant in such a 
fashion. A far more parsimonious explanation is that the apes have devised a means 
of mimicking language to get what they want in the moment, generally food and 
companionship.
Pinker (1995) argues that human language abilities are derived from an innate 
propensity absent in other animals. Humans have an “instinct” for language, and 
while other animals may communicate to various degrees, none of them come 
close to matching human language. Pinker also raises criticisms about ape lan­
guage research. He notes that deaf observers have questioned the validity of ape 
ASL, noting there are relatively few clear signs used by apes and that there is a high 
level of interpretation on the part of researchers. Pinker is noting another common 
strategy among pseudosciences, where supposedly objective tests are interpreted 
in an overly favorable manner. Misses, where the ape either doesn’t respond or 
responds improperly, tend to be downplayed or overlooked, and any partial or 
potentially relevant sign on the ape’s part is marked as an absolute positive. Having 
uninvolved deaf observers rank the ape’s performance provides a valuable control, 
one which serves to significantly reduce the significance of the results, and one 
which the researchers should have instituted themselves.
In addition to these disagreements regarding the interpretations of ape lan­
guage studies, we can identify concerns with the methods. First among these 
concerns is the issue of reproducibility. This is central to the scientific method; if 
a phenomenon identified by one scientist is real, another scientist using the same 
 
 

Apes and Sign Language  71
70
71
methods should also be able to reproduce the results. Science is rife with examples 
of supposedly groundbreaking results that were never reproduced and eventually 
found to be fictitious.
In the case of each of these ape language research programs, there is a signifi­
cant problem with reproducibility. Great apes are expensive to maintain, and lan­
guage studies are very long-​term, generally involving one principal investigator 
and possibly assistants monopolizing access to the animals and reporting results. 
There is little opportunity for confirmatory studies by separate researchers as there 
are in other natural sciences. The study of Nim was an attempt by Terrace to con­
firm the results reported for Washoe, an attempt that was largely a failure. Nim 
never exhibited anything like Washoe’s reported command of language. But also, 
Nim was a different animal, potentially with differing intelligence and linguistic 
ability, and the research on Nim was undertaken in a less natural context.
The reproducibility issue is even more pronounced with Koko. Most examples 
of Koko signing are interpreted by Patterson, without little external validation 
(Wilson 2021:5). This is suspect, and we must wonder who exactly is doing the 
talking, Koko or Patterson. A plausible best-​case scenario is that Koko may use 
some signs and Patterson then broadly interprets the results and reframes them as 
a coherent response. A rare example of an external validation bears this out. In a 
1998 online chat, Koko supposedly responded to questions posed by the public in 
real time (https://​bit.ly/​3NMc​ZSe). Only 1 reply out of 25 was clearly relevant to 
the questions asked. While this does not preclude that Koko know specific signs, 
it does indicate that a lack of awareness of an ongoing conversation and a general 
inability to engage in simple discourse.
Similar concerns can be raised about Kanzi. An animal behavior expert 
observed a film where Kanzi was apparently demonstrating a complex grasp of 
language, responding to numerous questions with correct responses. In reality, they 
found that Kanzi had a 70% error rate and often needed to be asked a question 
numerous times. Partial or tangential replies were scored as correct. Essentially 
Kanzi was being held to overly broad standards of what comprised language and 
communication (https://​skept​oid.com/​episo​des/​4630).
Another concern regarding these studies is the issue of the potential emo­
tional attachment of the researchers to the study subjects. In most scientific 
investigations, this is not a problem. Scientists may become emotionally attached 
to their interpretations, but rarely to the topic of study itself. But in the case of 
ape language studies, single or small numbers of researchers spend large amounts 
of time working closely with highly social primates who are capable of a wide 
range of human-​like emotions themselves. It would be almost impossible not to 
form an attachment to one’s subject under such circumstances, but this attachment 
surely must be a source of bias. And, as noted, there has been little opportunity 
for unbiased replication studies. The Nim Chimsky study once again stands out; 
Terrace seemed to show little emotional attachment to his subject; in this one 
study that arguably had the lowest obvious observer emotional attachment, we

also saw the least impressive linguistic ability. In short, the more objective the 
researcher, the smaller the observed effect.
The entire field of ape language studies is characterized by a generally emo­
tional and ideological tone. Proponents passionately argue that apes, or one ape 
in particular, has advanced linguistic ability, while others just as passionately argue 
for human exceptionalism, that language is a humans-​only club. One reviewer 
characterized the field as gripped by “partisan, quasi-​religious fervor” (Lieberman 
1993). Lost in such a divisive, all-​or-​nothing situation is the likelihood of appre­
ciating nuance and complexity, as well as the possibility of either side being 
persuaded by facts. Returning to the framing of logical fallacies, in this case we 
see a classic false dichotomy. Reality is complex, and rarely conforms to simple, 
diametrically opposed possibilities, but we are drawn to such fallacious simpli­
city. In this case, apes are neither linguistically human, nor completely unable to 
use language. The data indicates that while some apes can use symbols to express 
themselves in specific contexts, they also lack the ability to use the relationships 
between symbols (syntax and grammar) to communicate or to displace their com­
munication beyond their immediate context.
Some researchers have continued to press their arguments in favor of ape lan­
guage ability by essentially arguing to redefine what is meant by the term “lan­
guage”. William Fields, of the Great Ape Trust (where Kanzi is now kept) has 
argued that language is better defined as understanding the meaning of words, 
than in being able to employ those words with syntax and grammar (Cohen 
2010). This seemingly benign point is a common rhetorical gambit among those 
engaging in pseudoscience. If the rules of science are not favorable to your argu­
ment, then change the rules. Specifically, one often sees arguments that standards 
of evidence or key definitions should be relaxed to incorporate a favored, but 
factually unsupported, interpretation. Focusing on knowing the meaning of signs 
and ignoring lack of knowledge of the rules of how those signs are employed arti­
ficially favors the argument of ape language. By this argument, if someone were 
to memorize a Russian-​English dictionary, by dint of that knowledge alone they 
would speak Russian. Or in the case of “Chaser”, a border collie that “knew” 
1,022 nouns, Field’s definition would allow one to assert that the dog had a decent 
command of English.
Not only does this expansion of the definition of language inordinately favor 
the preferred hypothesis of ape researchers, but there is also a more pernicious 
aspect. If knowledge of words is the defining characteristic of language facility, 
how can we objectively discern whether an animal actually “knows” the word, 
that is, has an abstract association between the sound/​sign and an object or action? 
How do we know we are not simply seeing a conditioned response? Fields’s def­
inition makes the objective outcome of both the hypothesis (apes can learn lan­
guage) and the null hypothesis (apes can only evoke conditioned responses) the 
same. Only the ability to use words according to rules of syntax and grammar 
objectively shows linguistic ability, and any attempt to define language in such an 
 
 
 

Apes and Sign Language  73
72
73
overly broad manner is an attempt to circumvent scientific criteria. Ultimately, 
Fields’s argument about the definition of language is a distraction, giving equally 
short shrift to the unmatched linguistic ability of humans, as well as the impressive 
facility with signification of many other ape species.
Perhaps the most damning characterization of ape language research comes 
from Thomas Seebrook:
In my opinion, the alleged language experiments with ape’s divide into 
three groups: one, outright fraud; two, self-​deception; three, those conducted 
by Terrace [who studied Nim]. The largest class by far is the middle one.
In Wade 1980
Seebrook is essentially saying that most results of ape language are due to con­
firmation bias and cherry-​picking, or fraudulent science where some tests seem 
to be rigged in an ape’s favor. He singles out Terrace as the most legitimate and 
scientific of the studies. This does not throw the idea of ape language out the 
window. Nim Chimsky could use a limited range of signs to a degree that would 
have astounded primatologists even a few decades earlier. But Nim was also not a 
linguistic prodigy.
Moving past the specific scientific arguments made in ape language research, 
there are additional issues of concern. There are ethical issues in the study of great 
apes, and in at least one of the case studies summarized here. Apes are highly 
intelligent animals and require significant stimulation and enrichment to thrive. 
Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas all live in large, complex social groups. They 
are adapted to live in substantial territories within which they are highly mobile. 
Keeping such animals in restricted spaces, isolating from other members of their 
species, with minimal stimulation, is hugely stressful, and damaging to their phys­
ical and mental well-​being. If kept in captivity, best practices require substantial, 
naturalistic enclosures and numerous animals that recreate as closely as possible 
their natural environment. Even in the most conscientious of the studies herein 
discussed, these animals have been forced to live in circumstances that are far from 
optimal.
This is not to say that research on great apes is always unethical, but you must 
balance the value of the research against the potential harm to the research sub­
ject. We must ask, are the possible insights in language worth the potential harm to 
animals such as Washoe, Nim, Kanzi, or Koko? Furthermore, we have to consider 
the long-​term fate of these animals once research programs are terminated. In the 
case of these four specimens, none of them were kept in conditions that replicated 
their natural environment, and in some cases of Washoe and Nim their environ­
ment was made as human as possible, entirely alien to the chimpanzees. Kanzi and 
Koko’s habitats, while human, could be described as more clinical, neither natural 
to their species, nor the homey human habitats used for Washoe and Nim. Washoe, 
Nim, and Koko all died in captivity, while Kanzi is still a living research subject.

74
The most distressing outcome was for Nim, who was effectively abandoned after 
the conclusion of research, returned first to a primate research facility, then moved 
to a medical experimental center, and finally to a privately funded animal sanc­
tuary. Given that the experimental results of all four cases were largely equivocal, 
it is difficult in my opinion to ethically justify the research.
A concluding consideration would be the state of ape communication studies 
today, or rather, the lack thereof. There are always controversies in science, with 
proponents of different interpretations arguing the merits of their positions. When 
those debates are lengthy and ongoing, a nonexpert can at least conclude that 
there is probably something worth discussing, that there is a real phenomenon that 
scientists are struggling to understand. But in the case of ape sign language, we 
see a different pattern. There was a sudden burst of scholarly attention in the late 
1970s and 1980s, and then relatively little in the way of research thereafter. Popular 
attention continued, especially in the case of Koko, but this was not accompanied 
by any significant degree of peer-​reviewed research publication. This indicates that 
the fundamental question, “can apes talk?” was largely answered some time ago, in 
the negative. And then science moved on.
Or, calling back to the introduction, are these apes simply modern versions 
of Clever Hans? Well, maybe not quite. Apes are smart, social animals with a 
keen eye for minute behavioral tics among their neighbors, human, or ape. If a 
horse can learn to simulate math, it is entirely possible that a chimpanzee, gor­
illa, or bonobo could learn to convincingly simulate language simply through 
conditioned responses. Add in scientists who are emotionally attached both to 
their own hypotheses and their anthropoid subjects, insufficiently rigorous meth­
odology, and public popularity, and it is easy to see how the idea of ape language 
could gain traction. But a sober, objective view of the evidence does not support 
the ape language hypothesis. Apes are smart, apes can use signs to some degree, 
and probably engage in rudimentary communications with humans. But based 
on current work it does not seem that they are inchoate linguistic prodigies. And 
making them out to be so does not serve the interest of science.

PSEUDOLINGUISTICS
Linguistics, the scientific study of human language, has more than its fair share 
of pseudoscientific abuses, perhaps only second to archaeology. There is a likely 
reason for this. Cultural anthropology and biological anthropology do share some­
thing many might not consider. Both tend to study living populations, and thus 
have a clear empirical data set to refer to, even if interpretations of that data set 
may be highly variable. Even paleoanthropology, the study of extinct hominins, 
has tangible fossil remnants that have clear behavioral implications. Linguistics 
and archaeology, on the other hand, have deceptively ephemeral subjects. Many 
archaeologists pride themselves on their materialist basis in the archaeological 
record, forgetting that physical artifacts are only a proxy to inform on past culture 
and behavior, which exists at a level of abstraction. And linguistics, with its focus 
on words, phonemes, grammar, semantics, and so forth, is also necessarily studying 
an ephemeral abstraction. I suspect that where abstraction and ambiguity exist in 
any academic field, pseudoscience will more readily take root.
Among the most troublesome examples of pseudolinguistics relate to various 
attempts to draw spurious connections between different languages. Invariably 
when this occurs it is in support of some ideological agenda. Some such attempts 
can seem plausible to anyone without a deep knowledge of the languages in 
question. As such these examples can garner popular acceptance, especially as they 
often support popular political ideologies.
I note at the outset that historical linguistics, the scientific study of the develop­
ment of languages over time and the connections between languages and groups 
thereof is a legitimate area of inquiry. In fact, historical linguistics is one of the 
oldest branches of modern linguistics, with roots going back to the 1700s and 
philology (the study of ancient texts), biblical languages, and the development and 
spread of Indo-​European languages. Today historical linguistics exists as a branch 
 
 

76  Pseudolinguistics
76
76
of comparative linguistics that generally focuses on the relationships between 
languages and language groups.
Several points are worth making prior to any discussion of pseudolinguistics. 
First, languages are massively complex systems including characteristic sounds or 
phonemes, vocabulary, and rules of how those basic building blocks are combined 
to create meaning (syntax and grammar). To be meaningful, linguistic comparisons 
must be multifactorial, comparing multiple aspects of these components to be sure 
any similarities are due to actual relationships, and not simply chance. The sheer 
number of elements involved in a language, as well as the finite number of possible 
combinations of those elements, means that similarities will arise through chance 
alone. It is the job of the comparative linguist to determine meaningful from 
coincidental correlations between languages. As we will see, most pseudolinguistic 
arguments are based on insufficient analyses and overemphasis of spurious simi­
larities. Correlation, we have pointed out many times, does not equal causation, 
though we tend to fallaciously assume that to be the case.
Second, the analysis of language has significant implications for political power 
and cultural identity. Language is fundamental to culture and a key element in 
identity. Attempts to project a language onto geographic areas, or into the distant 
past, are essentially attempts to justify cultural ownership of those places and times. 
In attempting to associate particular areas and or historic periods with a particular 
language using less-​than-​rigorous methods, one is attempting to assert power and 
dominance unjustifiably. In addition, there have been attempts to show that some 
languages, and thus the speakers of those languages, are objectively superior to 
others, another linguistic expression of modern power politics. This could involve 
the misapplication of Darwinian concepts, wherein some languages won out over 
others in a survival of the fittest. Western, white languages typically have been seen 
as the victor: “The battle for the survival of a language … had been identified with 
the survival of the nation that spoke that language” (Aytürk 2004:4).
The “Sun Language” and the Founding of Modern Turkey
This use of language to contest power in the present is best explained through 
example. One strategy is to take a favored language and argue it has some founda­
tional or primordial status. For example, there are several pseudoscientific hypoth­
eses that are collectively referred to as “Goropism” after the seventeenth-​century 
Dutch scholar Jan Gerartsen van Gorp. Van Gorp argued that one regional Dutch 
dialect was the same language spoken in the Christian paradise, and as such was the 
root language spoken at the time of Creation. All other languages, he argued, are 
derived from this original language. Van Gorp’s argument was based on a series of 
trivial similarities between one Dutch dialect and classical languages such as Latin. 
In addition, he argued that the oldest language should be the simplest, and that his 
favored dialect qualified due to a pattern of relatively short word lengths. It should 
be noted that the Netherlands was a major international military and trading

power during the seventeenth century, and van Gorp’s ideas would have resonated 
with Dutch readers as justifying the power structures of the day.
One might think that such pseudolinguistic theorizing would end as know­
ledge of prehistory and scientific methods developed. But as late as the early twen­
tieth century, we still see similar ideas being expressed, that particular languages 
are primordial languages, dating back to the origins of humanity, or at least are 
most closely related to such a fundamental tongue. Consider the so-​called “Sun 
Language Hypothesis” regarding Turkish (Aytürk 2004).
The modern Republic of Turkey was formed from the post-​WWI wreckage 
of the Ottoman Empire in 1923. From the nation’s inception, there has been a 
concerted attempt to distance the modern secular state from the Ottoman Empire, 
as well as the Islamic states of the Middle East. The state language, Ottoman 
Turkish, presented an impediment to these goals, in that Turkish was both a legacy 
of the Ottoman past, and incorporated significant linguistic elements of Arabic, 
Persian, and several Eastern European languages as well. Turkish had been largely 
ignored or actively denigrated as an uncivilized language by nineteenth-​century 
philologists. However, the regime needed a unifying language to bond the many 
distinct ethnic groups that made up the newly minted republic. A state linguistic 
institute was established to purge the language of non-​Turkish elements, and the 
Roman alphabet was adopted in place of Arabic. There were repeated attempts by 
nationalistic linguists to associate Turkish with Indo-​European languages, even as 
the original Indo-​European root language.
Even given the efforts to purify the language, some foreign elements remained, 
which led some linguists and many politically powerful nonspecialists to support 
the “Sun Language Theory”. The theory, characterized as “a bewildering com­
bination of historical comparative philology, various elements from psychological 
theories of the nineteenth century and psychoanalytical themes from Sigmund 
Freud and Carl Gustav Jung” (Aytürk 2004:16), proposes that Turkic people 
created a complex civilization in Central Asia in the distant past but had to leave 
their homeland due to a drying climate, spreading in all directions out of Asia. 
During this mythological diaspora, they transmitted their advanced culture, as well 
as their language, to the less developed peoples they encountered. Such mother 
culture myths are common, the belief in Atlantis being the most popular. But in 
this case the Sun Language proponents claimed to have linguistic evidence to 
support their claims. A quasi-​etymological study of classical and other ancient 
languages purported to identify numerous sounds that had inherent meaning 
between languages and were also derived from Turkish. Turkish was not just a root 
to other languages in this argument, it was based upon fundamental and primor­
dial forms of human communication.
Also of fundamental importance to the theory is the role of the sun itself. 
The specifics of the connection are hazy, but the theory is so named due to 
the assumption that sun worship was central to the hypothetical ancient Turkic 
mother culture. This aspect seemed mostly to function as a convenient point of

correspondence; any past culture with a significant religious role for the sun could 
then be folded into the Sun Language theory model. Since the sun features prom­
inently in the pantheon of many pre-​Common Era societies, this made it pos­
sible for proponents to co-​opt almost any culture into the model. This is also an 
example of circular reasoning, or a tautology. The theory presupposes sun worship 
to be central, and any example of sun worship is then used to support the theory. 
Making a characteristic both define a phenomenon and also serve as evidence for 
that phenomenon in this fashion is a classic example of circular logic and is quite 
common in pseudoscientific arguments.
The Sun-​Language theory, when publicized internationally, was subject to 
strong critique, based on a general lack of empirical evidence and a highly ques­
tionable methodology. The theory had some continued traction within Turkey, 
based mostly on the support of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of the nascent 
Turkish state. The attraction of the theory as a political device far exceeded its aca­
demic value, as it provided a source of power and prestige for the new regime, and 
a potential source of nationalistic pride for the Turkish people.
The linguistic theories of the 1920s and 1930s were also essential components 
of the nation-​building programme in Turkey, one that aimed at providing 
the nation with a past that it can be proud of. One whole generation was 
educated at Turkish schools according to the precepts of the Turkish History 
and Language Theses. The theses instilled in them an awareness of belonging 
to a great nation, which carried its civilization to the west and whose latest 
political manifestation was the Republic of Turkey.
Aytürk 2004:19
The potential of such linguistic nationalism was obvious to the Turkish state. In 
a time of nation building and modernization, any appeal to a “golden age” of 
Turkish culture could serve to recast Westernization, the adoption of foreign tech­
nology, economy, and culture, as a return to an idyllic national past. Still, given the 
lack of international support, and waning acceptance among Turkish academics, 
the theory passed out of favor.
Theories of African Presence in Meso-​America
The Turkish example shows language being misrepresented for political motiv­
ations by a newly imposed political elite. Many examples of pseudolinguistics 
fall into this category, as a new regime explores various means of ideological 
reinforcement for a developing hegemony. We shall see in a later chapter similar 
use of pseudoarchaeology. But there is another possibility besides pseudoscientific 
support for the powerful: pseudoscientific support for resistance by the powerless.
An example of the presentation of pseudoscientific theories used to 
support resistance ideologies are hypotheses that African cultures engaged in 
 
 

Pseudolinguistics  79

pre-​Columbian contact with Native American cultures or were foundational to 
those cultures. Most of these hypotheses are archaeological, but linguistic evidence 
has also been co-​opted to this end. Prior to discussing the details of the hypoth­
esis and presenting counterarguments, it is worthwhile to consider the unique 
challenges posed in confronting such misuses of anthropological data.
Simply put, it is one thing to confront pseudoscience used for nationalistic 
ends by a political elite in control of a nation state. It is another thing entirely to 
confront ideas that support the significance of cultures that have historically been 
oppressed, victimized, and marginalized. To do so leaves one open to charges of 
racism by proponents of the theories in question, especially if one happens to be 
of a historically privileged race and class. Implicit in the discourse over such ideas 
is the fallacy that either you acknowledge their plausibility, or you are racist.
This is another dichotomy, artificially reducing a complex discourse to two 
options, with the intent of creating support for a preferred option by rendering 
the only alternative unsupportable. One could acknowledge that the evidence 
simply does not support the hypothesis, a statement of fact. The evidence that 
pre-​Columbian African cultures crossed the Atlantic is simply lacking at this point. 
The evidence so far put forth as indicating such contact has either been refuted 
or is more parsimoniously explained through other means. Saying so says nothing 
about the nature and potential of African cultures in general. It does not say they 
couldn’t have made such voyages, that they were not capable of it, it simply says 
at present there is no evidence that they ever did. Anyone who says otherwise, 
pending compelling evidence, is engaging in pseudohistory regardless of what 
their motives may be.
And even if these motives are benign in intent, to raise the profile of cultures 
underrepresented in academic discourse or popular thought, to make up for the 
very real wrongs done to those cultures in the past, the result of pseudohistory is 
not positive. All these arguments do is effectively seek to eclipse the real pasts of 
Native American cultures in favor of an ideologically desirable, but nonetheless 
imaginary, history. It is both ironic and hypocritical that such reimaginings of the 
Native American past commit the same misdeed proponents accuse mainstream 
academics of: suppressing one (African) past in favor of another (Euro-​centric) past.
Speculations that African cultures had a pre-​Columbian presence in the New 
World are part of the wider phenomenon of Afrocentrism. This school of thought 
has roots that go back to the nineteenth century but became particularly prom­
inent during and following the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Numerous 
scholars fall into the Afrocentrist approach, but for our purposes here it suffices 
to draw a distinction between two general trends. The first is the scholarly recog­
nition that African cultures have made significant contributions to world history, 
that there is a rich and vibrant African past, and that this history has been largely 
overlooked by Western scholars who have accentuated the role of European 
cultures in crafting historic narratives (see Chapter 7). Afrocentrism, in this 
frame, seeks to correct Eurocentric bias by explicitly focusing on the history and 
 

80  Pseudolinguistics

influence of African cultures. Reasonable scholars casting an unbiased eye on his­
torical reconstructions will acknowledge the plausibility and significance of this 
central idea, and the inclusion of African cultures has enriched the human story 
in recent years.
However, there is a pseudoscientific thread that has pervaded Afrocentrism 
since its inception, and which has regrettably served to taint the overall approach in 
the minds of many scholars. As one might envision given the focus on this chapter, 
the pseudoscientific side of Afrocentrism argues that Africans didn’t simply have 
as significant a history as any other people, but that they were directly responsible 
for the history of many ancient cultures outside of Africa. For example, Bernal has 
argued that the Ancient Greeks were descended in part from Egyptian colonies 
(Bernal 1987). This was based on uncritical acceptance of references in Herodotus 
and other ancient writers, as well as linguistic evidence in the form of Egyptian 
loan words in ancient Greek (Lefkowitz 2006:182).
Bernal’s work has been criticized as politically motivated and unsupported by 
the archaeological and historical records. His attempts to discredit traditional his­
torical narratives of the Classical world have depended heavily on the poisoning the 
well fallacy by associating his detractors with an implicitly racist “Aryan hypoth­
esis” rather than explicitly addressing the factual shortcomings of his argument. 
Despite this, some have argued that he did raise legitimate questions regarding 
the marginalization of Egypt in global histories and implicit racism in Western 
historiographies of the classical world.
Perhaps the way forward will to be to try to take Bernal’s questions and 
leave aside his answers, working through some excellent historiograph­
ical material that seems not to have captured the imaginations of most of 
Bernal’s respondents.
Marchand and Grafton 1997:31
I would argue that “capturing the imagination” is not a valid test of any hypoth­
esis, and that any attempt to address legitimate academic grievances through ques­
tionable interpretations of the evidence does more harm to one’s cause than good.
Other writers have claimed that the population of ancient Egypt were sub-​
Saharan African, when available evidence indicates that they were North African, 
more akin to Mediterranean and Middle Eastern populations. An even more 
extreme perspective presented by such figures as Legrand Clegg or Cheikh Anta 
Diop, where a global migration out of Africa is posited, with later replacement by 
Asian and Caucasian populations; the priority of the earlier African populations 
was then allegedly suppressed in a highly implausible global conspiracy (Haslip-​
Viera 1996; Haslip-​Viera et al. 1997).
The strong interpretations of Afrocentrism have been criticized as revisionist 
and lacking in supporting evidence. Shavit (2001:vii) characterized the movement 
as nothing less than “a large-​scale historical project to rewrite the history of the

whole of humankind” (Shavit 2001). As stated above, it is a scientific necessity to 
remove whatever unsubstantiated biases we can from our reconstructions of the 
past, Eurocentrism particularly given its substantial influence. But we do no cul­
ture justice by replacing one unsupported bias with another, however palatable it 
may be ideologically.
With these caveats in mind, we can look at some of the pseudolinguistic evidence 
that has been used to argue for a transatlantic African presence in the Americas 
prior to Columbus. Since we are dealing with prehistoric cultures, the evidence 
is generally epigraphic in nature. People have investigated written inscriptions 
from Mesoamerican cultures and drawn comparisons with the characteristics of 
various African languages. Alleged correspondences between the Mesoamerican 
inscriptions and African languages are then held to be evidence of past contact 
between those regions. The oldest culture in the Americas that has been subject to 
this sort of treatment is the Olmec.
The Olmec were a collection of complex societies located in the tropical 
lowlands of Mexico, west of the Yucatan Peninsula, between 1,500 and 400 b.c.e. 
Most of the hallmarks of Classic Mesoamerican civilizations, such as monumental 
construction, ball courts, and glyphic inscriptions, have their first known expres­
sion among the Olmec. Olmec sites first came to wide attention during the late 
nineteenth century, during a period when Western explorers publicized numerous 
sites with pyramids and other monumental architecture in Mesoamerica and 
South America. The idea that these Native American cultures were of Old World 
origin was expressed soon after their nineteenth-​century “discovery”, which was 
a common trope for most New World civilizations. The idea that the Olmec were 
specifically of African origin also dates to this early period of exploration, though 
this specific claim is notable in that you still see it raised in recently published 
content.
Numerous figures have suggested a connection between the Olmec and 
Africa, but the best known is Ivan Van Sertima. Van Sertima published They 
Came before Columbus in 1976. The volume argues based on spurious archaeo­
logical correspondences that all Mesoamerican civilizations had African origins. 
Specifically, he argued that Nubian rulers of Egypt from approximately 700 b.c.e. 
organized transatlantic voyages to establish colonies in the New World, founding 
the Olmec culture. Haslip-​Viera et al. (1997:420) summarize the broad points of 
Van Sertima’s argument. The Nubian fifth Egyptian dynasty sent an expedition 
through the Mediterranean, into the Atlantic, and down the African coast, where a 
current took it across the Atlantic to the Americas, specifically that part of Mexico 
occupied by the early Olmec.
According to the scenario at this point, the Olmecs presumably accepted the 
leaders of the Nubian/​Egyptian expedition as their rulers … and these indi­
viduals, in turn, created, inspired or influenced the creation of the Olmec 
 
 

82  Pseudolinguistics

82
civilization, which in turn influenced Monte Alban, Teotihuacan, the Classic 
Maya, and all the other Mesoamerican civilizations that followed.
There are several fundamental issues of implausibility in this argument even before 
one addresses the specific evidence mustered in its defense. For example, the 
Nubian dynasties, sub-​Saharan conquerors of Egypt late in ancient Egyptian his­
tory, ruled hundreds of years after the Olmec culture (Van Sertima later adjusted 
his timeline in an attempt to account for this).
While it is perhaps technically possible that Egyptian seafaring technology of 
the time could have allowed them to cross the Atlantic, there would have been 
little reason to do so, there being no knowledge of anyplace west of Africa to 
voyage to at the time. The odds of completing such a voyage would be very low 
and would have required ideal conditions and huge amounts of luck. And there 
is the small issue that Egypt and Nubia are located on the wrong side of Africa, 
necessitating first crossing thousands of miles of the Sahara or equatorial basin of 
Africa, or sailing across the entire Mediterranean Sea, before even setting sail. In 
short, the claim was highly implausible, and the necessary burden of proof thus 
very high.
The volume was roundly criticized by the anthropological community, though 
it sold well in the public market. Von Sertima also fits a mold seen in several other 
cases covered in the volume. He was not a trained anthropologist or archaeologist, 
though he had some linguistic background in the study of Swahili. He did not 
publish scholarly articles in peer-​reviewed journals, and his books were published 
by popular publishing houses. He published the Journal of African Civilizations, 
which was a nonreviewed outlet for his own writing. Together this puts together 
a picture of someone with a pseudoscientific (but popular) argument but avoiding 
any of the real accreditation and peer review that ensure scientific accuracy. Van 
Sertima died in 2009, but his questionable hypothesis lives on. All of that would 
be irrelevant if Van Sertima’s hypotheses, and those of similar writers, had corrob­
orating evidence that was accepted by the scientific community. However, such 
was not the case.
Van Sertima based his case on a range of largely circumstantial evidence. 
Part of his argument was based on an uncritical reading of documents from the 
voyages of Columbus, which contain references to “Black” Indians and to metal 
of purported African origin (Feder 2018:109). Taking these references as fac­
tual evidence of African presence in the Americas commits fundamental error of 
ethnohistory: assuming a historical writer shared the same frame of reference as 
a modern reader. For example, Van Sertima assumes that the concept of “Black” 
meant the same thing to a fifteenth-​century European as it does today. In fact, 
racial and ethnic definitions are fluid and have changed significantly over time. 
It is also unclear how exactly the source area of a given metal was identified as 
African. In the fifteenth century, Africa was the most foreign place known to 
 

Pseudolinguistics  83
82
83
learned Europeans, and it is more likely that calling something African was simply 
an assumption regarding an unknown substance as opposed to a literal assessment 
of the material’s origin.
Most of Van Sertima’s evidence was archaeological in nature. For example, 
the monumental architecture built by the Olmec, specifically step pyramids, 
were portrayed as having been based on Egyptian step pyramid designs. But step 
pyramids were not characteristic of the Nubian-​dominated late dynasties; pyramid 
building was a predominantly Old Kingdom characteristic, substantially pre­
dating the Olmec. Another major line of evidence referenced by Van Sertima were 
the massive, monolithic carved heads that are emblematic of the Olmec. Several 
early researchers have suggested that the facial features of these depictions were 
“negroid” in appearance. Van Sertima assumes them to be literal representations of 
African rulers of lowland Mexico. This line of evidence has also been debunked, 
and the characteristics of the heads are within the range of variation one would 
expect for a pre-​Hispanic indigenous population. One fact that Van Sertima 
ignores is the absence of artifacts of African origin in Mesoamerica during the 
period in question. It was either a very tidy invasion, or it never happened.
However, one major pillar of Van Sertima’s argument was linguistic, and it is 
to this argument we now turn our attention. Citing the work of Leo Wiener, a 
Slavic language expert active in the early twentieth century, Van Sertima proposes 
numerous word similarities between Olmec languages and Egyptian languages, 
particularly the language used in inscriptions in Middle Egyptian, ca. 1200–​700 
b.c.e. For example, he claims that words for ships of Egyptian royalty, and for itin­
erant teachers, have close analogs in Epi-​Olmec (Figure 5.1). Ortiz de Montellano 
et al. (1997) demolishes such claims on methodological grounds. First, they note 
that Van Sertima is not comparing Olmec, for which we do not have a viable 
translation, but Nahuatl, spoken in Highland Mexico over a millennium post-​
Olmec, and belonging to a completely different language family.
This is like claiming that the ancient Egyptians had contact with the ancient 
Scythians of Northern Europe by discovering word similarities between 
ancient Egyptian and Modern Portuguese.
Ortiz de Montellano et al. 1997:208
Also, they note that even if one were to accept the comparison, the Nahuatl words 
provided as evidence of connection are either mistranslated, they simply don’t 
mean what Van Sertima argues, or they don’t exist in Nahuatl at all. In skeptical 
terms, Van Sertima is committing a faulty analogy logical fallacy. The two concepts 
being compared, Middle Egyptian and historic Nahuatl, are simply not compar­
able, and any correlations between the two must be spurious.
Finally, as noted above, it is not viable linguistic methodology to compare 
languages purely based on words. Syntax and grammar are crucial, and Van Sertima 
 
 

84  Pseudolinguistics
84
84
makes no attempt to address this. Ortiz de Montellano et al. (1997:431) conclude 
regarding Van Sertima’s linguistic arguments:
He claims linguistic and cultural influences between peoples and cultures 
that existed thousands of years apart without any evidence of an inter­
mediate transmitting culture.
This is yet another logical fallacy, confusing correlation with causation. There are 
only so many possible combinations of sounds that can make up words and given 
the vast linguistic diversity among human cultures it is inevitable that correlations

between languages, even those widely separated in time and space, would occur. But 
this does not by itself confirm connections between those languages. Identifying 
correlations is the beginning of a scientific inquiry, not the end.
Other writers have delved into Afrocentric interpretations of the Olmec. 
Winters (1982:78–​84) states that the Olmec language is of Western Saharan geo­
graphic origin, which, while at least in Western, not Eastern Africa, still entails an 
early transatlantic voyage with no corroborating physical evidence. Winters also 
made little attempt to publish in academic journals, and broadly followed the same 
methods as Van Sertima, seeking “loan words” between widely separated and unre­
lated languages.
Even less plausible epigraphic arguments have been made in the hopes of illus­
trating African–​Olmec connections. Wiener, whose earlier work influenced Van 
Sertima, argued that the Epi-​Olmec script had similarities with an African syllabic 
script known as Vai (Wiener 1922:271) (Figure 5.2). This is a frankly ludicrous 
FIGURE 5.2 A script for the Vai language, photographed circa 1849. British Library.

86  Pseudolinguistics
86
86
claim as Vai was intentionally constructed as a syllabary for the Vai language spoken 
in Liberia in the 1830s, in much the same way as the Cherokee script was created 
historically to write the Cherokee language (there may in fact have been influence 
between Vai and Cherokee) (Tuchscherer 2002). This is assuming connections 
between written scripts separated by over 3,000 years of history, and over 5,000 
miles of ocean. No legitimate linguist would give any credence to such a spurious 
analogy.
Rafinesque made a similar argument in the late 1800’s for Classic Period Maya 
inscriptions being related to the Libyco-​Berber writing of Africa (2001a, 2001b). 
While the inscriptions in question were over a thousand years more recent than 
the Epi-​Olmec script studied by Wiener, they were also potentially over a thou­
sand years younger than Libyco-​Berber to which they were being compared, and 
a similar distance geographically. And finally, the comparisons with the African 
languages were based on simplistic and coincidental similarities in specific symbols, 
an insufficient measure of linguistic connections.
The idea of distant, Old World origins for New World cultures is hardly 
limited to the Afrocentric claims regarding the civilizations of Mesoamerica. 
Litvac (in Ortiz et al. 1997:435) notes “Finding exotic origins for pre-​Hispanic 
American cultures is not new. The sport is older than archaeology”. Such lin­
guistic claims must be put in the context of extreme hyper-​diffusionary claims in 
pseudoanthropology, where single cultures, or cultural traits, are argued to have 
spread across implausibly vast areas of the ancient world. Suffice it to say that 
claims of extreme cultural diffusions, such as Van Sertima and others argue, are 
never adequately supported by valid evidence, and are always politically, not sci­
entifically, motivated.
When considering Afrocentric claims regarding the pre-​Columbian past 
of the Americas, we should in all fairness note that when Rafinesque and 
Wiener made their claims, there was no absolute chronology for comparing 
cultures, as radiocarbon technology not having been invented yet. And, hyper-​
diffusionary arguments were not uncommon during the late nineteenth and 
early twentieth centuries. The dominant paradigm of the time was that sig­
nificant innovations were rare and limited to specific areas of high advance­
ment, mostly located in the Classical world, or along the Nile. This does not 
excuse the sheer implausibility of a transatlantic voyage given the technology 
of the eras in question, but they would not have been able to appreciate the 
chronologic incongruities on which their hypotheses were based. This excuse 
of course does not apply to Van Sertima, who was writing well after abso­
lute chronologies were available. Even though Rafinesque and Wiener were 
refuted decades prior to Van Sertima’s work, Van Sertima followed the same 
flawed methodology, a methodology that is still invoked by those seeking to 
demonstrate Afrocentric pseudohistory.
There are several logical fallacies to which Afrocentric theories fall prey. The 
fact that so many of these pre-​Columbian migrations models focus on the Olmec 
 
 
 

Pseudolinguistics  87
86
87
is telling. Archaeologists know the least about the Olmec in comparison to other 
major Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Maya or the Aztec. The Olmec are 
the oldest complex society in the region and being oldest they have the least sur­
viving evidence. The Epi-​Olmec script, so central to pseudohistorical scholars, is 
still largely untranslated.
These archaeological facts, or often, a lack of facts, makes these contexts par­
ticularly susceptible to pseudoscientific interpretations. We see reference to “argu­
ment from ignorance” fallacies. Implicit in the work of Van Sertima and others 
is the idea that, since we don’t know exactly what Epi-​Olmec translates to, their 
interpretations are as good as anyone else’s. Or, since there are gaps in our know­
ledge of the Olmec, pseudoscientific explanations could be used to explain missing 
data in a way that favors the Afrocentric agenda (the “God of the gaps” fallacy). 
These are flawed ideas based on faulty logic, and Epi-​Olmec scholars refer to a 
host of linguistic knowledge of related, later languages in Mesoamerica to eluci­
date Epi-​Olmec. While we may not know exactly what an Epi-​Olmec inscription 
says, we can see it clearly fits with the development of Mesoamerican languages, 
it is clearly an indigenous development, and not a product of a speculative African 
migration.
The linguistic analyses commit the fallacy of cherry-​picking which has been 
documented several times in this volume. In this case, the simplistic and flawed 
linguistic methods Van Sertima and others partly base their interpretations on 
are based on finding correlations between specific words in widely separated 
languages. We have already discussed how when such correlations are identified, 
they are confusing correlation with causation, and that any common words are 
spurious associations. Also worth noting are all the words that don’t have any cor­
relation between the two languages. The greater this “negative data” the less likely 
any real connection between the languages in question becomes. In emphasizing 
the “hits”, words that are found in both Epi-​Olmec and Egyptian, and ignoring 
the vastly more numerous “misses”, they falsely give a stronger impression of asso­
ciation than if they compared the languages holistically on multiple criteria, as 
legitimate linguists would.
In closing we can again ask the question: what’s the harm? Other than creating 
a curious tangent in the study of past cultures, what real harm did the Afrocentric 
theories of Van Sertima and his earlier influences do? Two issues come to mind. 
First, misrepresenting the past of both Africa and Mesoamerica in this manner 
is damaging to the heritage of both culture areas. To say that the Olmec derived 
their greatest cultural developments from more advanced peoples from across 
the ocean is as troubling as arguing that the people of ancient Egypt were gifted 
their cultures from aliens from across the stars (see Chapter 7). Afrocentrists who 
would likely justly criticize such assertions commit the same intellectual mis­
deed. Haslip-​Viera (1996:136) aptly notes how Afrocentric interpreters of the 
Native American past “appear to be quite willing to trample of the self-​esteem 
of Native Americans by minimizing their role as actors in their own history, 
 

88  Pseudolinguistics
88
88
by denigrating their cultures, and by usurping their contributions to human 
development”.
Second, the very lack of plausibility and supporting evidence of the trans­
atlantic hypothesis makes it easier for those unwilling to acknowledge the cul­
tural developments of regions beyond Europe. The extreme hypotheses of a small 
number of scholars enables those who wish to discredit the work of scholars who 
note civilization has been a multicultural attainment, not the sole possession of 
specific ethnicities. In making extreme claims of African cultural superiority, Van 
Sertima and others ironically provide ammunition for racist arguments. In add­
ition, by depending so heavily on now outdated biological definitions of race, these 
strong Afrocentric interpretations risk resurrecting essentialist racial definitions 
that were central to racist paradigms in the past and from which anthropology has 
spent generations trying to escape (Haslip-​Viera 1996:135).
Norse Runes in North America
The last case study deals with linguistic hoaxes. Unlike previous cases, where 
researchers were at least attempting to engage with data, albeit with poor standards 
of evidence and fallacious logic, in this case we confront situations where people 
have perpetuated hoaxes.
In 1898, Olaf Ohman, a Swedish immigrant, produced a 200-​pound, 30-​inch-​
long slab stone carved in what appeared to be runes (Figure 5.3). Runes refers to 
a range of alphabets used to write Germanic languages prior to the adoption of 
the Roman alphabet. Some of these cultures comprised peoples today referred to 
as Norse, seafaring, and farming societies in Scandinavia and the north European 
coast. The earliest runes date to approximately 150 c.e., and most runic alphabets 
ceased to be used by 1100 c.e. These alphabets were used predominantly in 
northern Europe and Anglo-​Saxon Britain. What made this particular stone so 
remarkable was its provenance: Ohman claimed to have found it under a tree at 
his home near Kensington in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The story of what came 
to be known as the Kensington Rune Stone is one of false history, ethnic nation­
alism, and the misuse of archaeology for ideological purposes.
There is a real history and a pseudohistory of Norse presence in North 
America. The real Norse history begins in the ninth century when Old Norse-​
speaking populations from Scandinavia, Iceland, and Northern Europe began 
voyaging within the North Sea, North Atlantic, and Mediterranean Sea. Norse 
voyagers were either engaged in raiding coastal settlements or establishing new 
Norse settlements. The farthest west such settlement was on Newfoundland, 
a small and short-​lived settlement in what was referred to as Vinland. This was 
described in Icelandic sagas, and likely occurred in approximately 1000 c.e. 
This was later verified archaeologically through the discovery of the L’Anse aux 
Meadows site in 1960. There were eight buildings at the site, which was the home 
 
 

Pseudolinguistics  89
88
89
for approximately 100–​150 people, over perhaps 100 years (Forbes et al. 2019). It 
is likely that the inhabitants of the site travelled about the region, and interacted 
with the local Native groups, and iron objects of likely Norse origin are found in 
contemporary Native contexts. However, even while recent research indicates a 
longer duration of occupation that previously realized, L’Anse aux Meadows is still 
the only known definitive Norse settlement in North America.
There is a long tradition of pseudohistorical claims of Norse presence in 
North America well into the continental interior. There is a widespread folk 
belief that Norse explored and even settled the U.S. Midwest during the four­
teenth century, a belief that is based in large part on the Kensington Stone 
(Michlovic 1990:104).

The runes on one face and edge of the stone were translated upon its discovery, 
and supposedly state the following:
Eight Götalanders and 22 Northmen on…journey from Vinland far to the 
west. We had a camp…one day’s journey north from this stone. We were 
fishing one day. After we came home, found 10 men red from blood and 
dead. Ave Maria save from evil. There are 10 men by the inland sea to look 
after our ships fourteen day’s journey from this peninsula. Year 1362.
If genuine, this inscription tells an amazing tale. In the year 1362, eight Swedes 
(Götalanders) and 22 Norwegians (Northmen) travelled from settlements in 
Newfoundland, making their way by sea and river deep into the North American 
interior. While on this journey, their camp was presumably attacked by Natives, 
who killed ten members of the party. This story, of intrepid Scandinavians and 
savage Natives, resonated with the early twentieth-​century immigrant population 
of Minnesota as a testament to the courage and accomplishments of their ancestors. 
The stone is on display today in its own museum in Alexandria, Minnesota.
There is ample reason to be skeptical of the artifact’s authenticity. As good 
skeptics we should start with the plausibility of the claim. The stone was discovered 
over 1,500 miles from Newfoundland, and the shortest possible route between the 
two points by boat would be over 2,000 miles, assuming a route through the Saint 
Lawrence and Great Lakes. This alone is an astounding claim and would require 
substantial corroborating evidence (Feder 2019:56). Such a voyage would not have 
been impossible, and the Norse were famous for voyages of similar distance. But 
possible is not the same as probable, and unlike Norse voyages in the Old World, 
there is little in the way of corroborating evidence aside from the Kensington 
Stone itself.
There is also the matter of the stone’s supposed date. The fourteenth century 
c.e. voyage detailed in the stone would have occurred three centuries after known 
Norse inhabitation of Newfoundland. The Norse occupation of Newfoundland 
correlated with a period of mild climate termed the Medieval Warm Period. 
However, the fourteenth-​century date on the stone correlates with the Little Ice 
Age, when climate was much colder, making such a voyage even less plausible 
than it would have been when Newfoundland was occupied centuries earlier. 
In short, the extraordinary nature of the claimed journey, as well as its unlikely 
timing, render the claim of Kensington’s authenticity highly implausible before 
one addresses its linguistic characteristics.
The stone’s authenticity was questioned almost immediately. The first aca­
demic to evaluate the object was Olaus Breda (1910), an expert in Scandinavian 
languages from the University of Minnesota. It is unclear if Breda had access to 
the stone or if he was working from a copy, but in either event he discounted the 
legitimacy of the inscription on linguistic grounds. While inscribed in medieval 
runes, the stone was deemed “a poor attempt at forging an eleventh-​century text

and an illiterate mixture of Norwegian, Swedish and English” (badarchaeology.
com, accessed 9/​12/​2019). Symbols expressing case and punctuation were used 
inappropriately, and the inscription included modern terms. Some runes were 
used in a phonetically inappropriate fashion, indicating the author didn’t really 
understand the runic system.
Soon thereafter a linguist from Northwestern University also expressed doubt 
regarding the stone’s fourteenth-​century origin, noting that the inscription 
appeared recently made and unweathered. In short, the initial expert opinion was 
that Kensington was a weathered piece of rock that had been inexpertly engraved 
recently to seem as if it were much older … that is to say, a hoax. That said, Breda 
translated and published the inscription in 1899.
The stone was effectively forgotten for nearly a decade until 1907, when it 
came into the possession of historian Hjalmar Holland. Holland was born in 
Norway and emigrated to the United States as a child. His career was dedicated to 
the documentation of Norwegian immigration to the Midwestern United States. 
He was among the first scholars to propose that Norse had settled in North 
America centuries before Columbus’s voyages, a proposition we now know to 
be true. However, he is best known for his wholehearted endorsement of the 
Kensington Stone. In a 1910 publication Holland referred to Kensington as the 
“Oldest Document in America” (Holland 1910). He stated the stone’s authenticity 
was corroborated by “many other Swedish, Norwegian and Danish Scholars” but, 
with two exceptions, does not specify their identities.
Holland’s arguments for the legitimacy of the inscription were based on a series 
of common cognitive errors and logical fallacies. The article opens with references 
to Norse travelers out of Greenland, which were occasionally of significant dur­
ation and had no documented destination. Where else, might these travelers have 
been going, if not North America? This is an argument from ignorance … all that 
is known of these voyages is that we don’t know where they went, which isn’t suf­
ficient cause to assign a destination that fits with Holland’s hypothesis.
Holland next addressed the critique of the low plausibility of Norse explorers 
making it so far inland. His attempt to counter this weakness in his hypoth­
esis was to argue “… while it is improbable, it must be admitted that it is not 
impossible. Stranger things than this have happened”. He went on to cite three 
lengthy voyages by river in North America by European explorers during the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In part this is simply an example of human 
innumeracy, a generally poor understanding of probability. Acknowledging the 
low probability of an event is just the opposite of evidence in favor of that event. 
Just because something is possible is not sufficient to argue for its existence, and 
with low probability science demands strong evidence before accepting a con­
clusion. Second, there is false analogy. Exploration during the 1600s and 1700s, a 
period of significantly improved geographic knowledge and nautical technology, 
is not comparable to hypothetical travel in the 1300s. The existence of the former 
is not applicable to investigating the latter.

Holland went on to address the critique that “it is a physical impossibility 
to travel from salt water to Kensington in 14 days”. I suspect that this is a straw 
man argument, as the concern is one of probability, not physical possibility. By 
responding to the issue of physical possibility, rather than general likelihood, 
Holland attempted to deflect the argument against his hypothesis. He made a 
similar argument against the criticism that there were no previous discoveries of 
runestones in North America, arguing that absence of evidence is not evidence 
of absence. In fact, absence of evidence can be evidence of absence, if there are 
credible reasons to expect the phenomenon in question to leave said evidence. At 
best this is another example of equating a slight possibility with a high likelihood.
Holland then turned to arguments against the inscription itself. The numbers 
in the inscription, it had been argued, did not correspond with numerical systems 
used by the Norse at the supposed time of the stone’s creation. Holland attempted 
to counter this by arguing that the numbers in fact correspond to runic calendar 
objects called “primstavs” and cites a seventeenth-​century document that cited 
fourteenth-​century examples. The source in question has been lost, and he had 
never actually read it. This is essentially an anecdote, not objective evidence. It’s 
also a false analogy, as the earliest known primstavs date to the fifteenth century, 
a century after the Kensington date. Primstavs were, however, in use up to the 
nineteenth century, and were items nineteenth-​century Swedish immigrants in 
Minnesota would have been familiar with. This thus makes a more compelling 
argument for Kensington being of recent, not ancient, construction.
There have been further critiques of the numeric system used in the stone, and 
of Holland decipherment. Stiebling (1984:163) notes that the 1362 date from the 
stone is problematic and that the runic characters translated for the date could also 
be read to state a date of 1898.
Holland then attempted to address linguistic critiques and argued that 
observations that the Kensington runes are different from contemporary 
inscriptions are not valid, as there is variation among contemporary sources. He 
specifically critiqued dependence on the Codex Runicus version of the Scanian 
law, noting that other contemporary documents also differ in some letters from 
that runic version of Scandinavian legal code. While not wrong per se, Holland’s 
point is misleading, as the Scanian law document is a primary text for runology, 
and the fact that other texts differ does not really support Kensington’s legitimacy, 
though it does not in and of itself discredit it either. Holland also notes that the 
Scanion law was written a century prior to the Kensington date, which is also 
misleading, as the document was maintained until well after the Kensington date. 
Essentially, any fourteenth-​century Scandinavian runic author would likely have 
been aware of the document, so Holland understates its significance.
A similar faulty argument was made to explain away an incongruous rune that 
appeared in no other text. This rune would likely have been an invention of a 
modern forger. Holland pointed to an example of a similar rune in a legitimate 
document as evidence that the inscription was legitimate. He mentioned this 
 
 

Pseudolinguistics  93
92
93
source dated to 1600 but ignored the implication. If the rune in question was not 
used until the early seventeenth century, it hardly strengthens his case for it to be 
found on a supposed fourteenth-​century inscription.
Another incongruity noted by runic experts was the inclusion of Latin letters 
A, V, and M, presumably for “Ave Virginis Mariae” or “Hail the Virgin Mary” at the 
conclusion of the inscription. It would have been unusual for a runic inscription to 
include Latin characters in this manner, but Holland argued that the “runemaster” 
sought to dignify “his appeal to the holy mother” through the use of the lan­
guage of the church. This, he argued, indicates the rune carver “was a priest or 
clerk of the church” and argued for the stone’s authenticity. In fact, this weakens 
his argument still further, by violating a basic principle of explanation, the par­
simony principle, better known as “Occam’s Razor”, which cautions against the 
introduction of additional assumptions in an argument. By seeking to intuit the 
rune carver’s intentions, as well as possible occupation, Holland introduced two 
unfounded assumptions. His argument is also an example of special pleading, or ad 
hoc logic, as he invokes special circumstances to counter a weakness in his argu­
ment. Rather than conceding that the use of incongruous Latin characters exposes 
the inscription as a hoax, Holland invokes a special circumstance: the carver must 
have been a priest, despite a total lack of supporting evidence.
The most common and most damning linguistic argument against the stone’s 
authenticity is that the language in which it was written was essentially modern, 
not medieval and certainly not Old Norse. Holland addresses this by arguing 
that fourteenth-​century Swedes spoke the same language as modern Swedes, so 
“modern” expressions on the stone do not invalidate it. Even in the absence of 
expert testimony, this allegation strains plausibility. The English of Beowulf is not 
the same as the English of Chaucer, which differs from that of Shakespeare, which 
is not the same as the language of Dickens. To expect no such divergence to 
have occurred for Swedish is simply not plausible. Experts on the languages in 
question have repeatedly validated this point. Wahlgren (1958, 1982:4), an expert 
on Scandinavian languages and on the runestone phenomenon in general, notes 
no credible language expert accepts Holland’s argument. Those few “experts” that 
do are all non-​Scandinavian linguistics, or not linguists at all. To accept Holland’s 
argument would be an extreme case of cherry-​picking, ignoring a clear consensus 
in favor of a fringe opinion to validate a highly implausible argument.
Soon after Holland’s publication, the Minnesota Historical Society began its 
own investigation of the stone under the direction of State Geologist Newton 
Winchell. Winchell himself concluded that the stone was a legitimately ancient 
find, though this determination seems to be based on affidavits of Ohman and 
others regarding the circumstances of its discovery. This is problematic as a form 
of evidence on several fronts. First, it depended on the likely flawed recollec­
tion of several people of events a decade in the past at that point. Second, even 
under ideal conditions this would be anecdotal evidence, and hence subjective and 
unverifiable. Third, it did not account for the possibility that key figures would 
 
 

94  Pseudolinguistics
94
94
misrepresent the truth. If Kensington was a hoax, individuals involved would have 
been incentivized to lie keep their role secret.
The story of the Kensington Stone should have been over in 1958 when 
Wahlgren published a definitive debunking of Holland’s claims. But stranger inter­
pretations were to come. In 1967, Ole Landsverk published a new claim regarding 
the artifact. Previously a supporter of Holland, Landsverk altered his views to 
suggest that the stone was something else entirely. The fractured attempts at medi­
eval runes were not the attempts of a hoaxer, but represented an intentional code, 
a cryptogram (Wahlgren 1982:160). Specifically, Landsverk argues that the actual 
content of most runestones, Kensington included, is irrelevant, as all are secretly 
cryptograms of significant dates in the Roman Catholic calendar. This calendar, 
based on Arabic decimal numbers, was known in Scandinavia as early as the elev­
enth century, and thus must be the basis of the inscriptions. Wahlgren notes this is 
a fallacy, the “argument from silence” where one assumes something which is not 
specifically contradicted must be true. Awareness of the Catholic calendar does 
imply its use, much less provide proof of a secret calendric code. As already noted, 
the use of decimal numbers is a fundamental anachronism that points toward the 
stone’s fraudulent creation.
Belief in the inscription’s legitimacy is no doubt related to the large population 
of Scandinavian ancestry in the American Midwest today.
With unprecedented unanimity the reviewers agreed that the Kensington 
Stone was a product of Scandinavian immigration, to be sure, but of the 
nineteenth rather than of the fourteenth century.
Wahlgren 1982:158
While Feder (2019:67) notes:
It is impossible to know for sure if the desire to establish Nordic priority 
in the New World and the attendant enhancement of ethnic pride that 
followed was the inspiration for the Kensington Runestone. However, it is 
pretty clear that it serves that purpose today.
The veracity of such runic inscriptions has become embedded in folk beliefs of 
the region. Michlovic (1990) argues that these folk beliefs are due to the ethnic 
pride of Midwesterners and should not be considered as ethnocentric or racist. 
He further argues anthropologists critiquing these beliefs are doing so out of a 
desire to control historic narratives and enhance their careers. Several researchers 
(Cole et al. 1990) have argued that this is not the case, and that allowing any 
pseudohistorical belief to persist unchallenged is potentially harmful and an abro­
gation of scholarly ethics.
Aside from the damage any forged document can do to the objective study of 
history, what harm has Kensington done? First, it seems to have contributed to 
 
 

Pseudolinguistics  95
94
95
other “copycat” hoaxes, similar runestones purported to have been of Norse medi­
eval ancestry, but clearly modern forgeries. One example are rune-​inscribed stones 
found at Spirit Pond in Maine (Haugen 1972). The Spirit Pond specimens in seem 
to have been directly influenced by Kensington. One hoax may be hopefully 
ignored, but a pattern of them might lead curious nonexperts to draw inaccurate 
conclusions about their legitimacy and the erroneous historical narrative with 
which they are associated.
The greatest damage wrought by hoaxes like Kensington is the same as for 
linguistic pseudoscience in general. Language is fundamental to ethnicity, and the 
real or perceived presence of one or another ethnic group someplace in the past 
creates a claim on that place by descendants. Kensington today is essentially a 
falsified document believed by many to lay claim to territory, territory that had 
been recently colonized by the current Scandinavian occupants. Regardless of the 
intention of the forger, Kensington has become a tool of colonial justification and 
ethnocentrism, if not ethnonationalism.
The implicit message of white supremacy was present from the earliest interpret­
ations of the stone. Holland’s original 1910 defense of the stone’s authenticity refers 
to Native Americans as “wild heathens” who commit “savage trick of war and sor­
cery” while the author of the stone was part of a group of “undaunted” Norsemen. 
Regardless of the intent of the hoaxer, the subtext of the stone today is one of 
belittling Native peoples while extoling an imaginary white history and land claim.
There is also the obvious question, who perpetuated the hoax? The list of 
possible culprits is fairly short. Olof Ohman is the most likely candidate by far. 
Wahlgren (1958) noted Ohman never denied involvement in a hoax well after 
the claim was public. Ohman also was known to have owned Swedish texts 
whose linguistic qualities were similar to those expressed on the stone. Ohman 
may have had accomplices and Wahlgren notes it is likely more than one person 
was involved.
As for motives, hoaxers are typically motivated by money or ideology. In this 
case both factors were likely a factor. Ohman sold the stone to the Minnesota 
Historical Society in 1910 for $10, over $250 in today’s value. Like many in the 
region, Ohman was a recent Swedish immigrant with a vested interest in boosting 
claims of early Swedish presence in the area. Wahlgren speculates that Ohman 
and perhaps others may have started the hoax essentially as a joke but following 
Holland’s and Winchell’s ardent popularization of the stone, found themselves 
unable to come clean.
Kensington Stone today is widely regarded as evidence of Norse (or “Viking”) 
occupation of the Midwest. The Runestone Museum, where the stone is cur­
rently on display, provides the following text on its website (runestonemuseum.
org, accessed 9/​28/​2019):
To this day, anyone who visits the museum will recognize instantly that there 
is something unusual about this artifact, and the question of its authenticity

has been a lightning rod for debate. For more than 100 years, scientists, 
geologists, and linguists have studied the stone in an effort to offer a conclu­
sive answer to the question of the Runestone’s authenticity.
While not explicitly endorsing the stone as a legitimate fourteenth-​century docu­
ment, this message fails to note the scholarly consensus that it is a forgery. This is 
another common tactic of pseudoscience, the “false controversy”. Unable to con­
vincingly support an argument, one says the claim is as yet unfalsified or contro­
versial, when in fact it has been convincingly disproven. The claim of controversy 
is then publicized in popular media and widely consumed, and believed, while the 
debunking is relegated to scholarly publications of limited circulation. The claim 
thus becomes widely held to be true, when it has in fact been shown to be false.
If a nonexpert encounters information about the Kensington Stone today, it is 
most likely to be through credulous, misleading or simply false popular program­
ming or internet information. For example, Scott Wolter has been featured on 
The History Channel’s “Holy Grail in America” and “America Unearthed”. Both 
programs have presented the stone as a legitimate ancient artifact, though Wolter 
expands the pseudohistoric narrative to a degree Hjalmar Holland would likely 
have found implausible. Not content with the “evidence of Viking presence in the 
Midwest” narrative, in Wolter’s presentations the stone is connected to the Knights 
Templar, who fled to the New World following their persecution, and also a clue 
to the whereabouts of the Holy Grail supposedly used by Jesus at the Last Supper.
This sweeping assessment is largely based on a vague similarity between one 
symbol on the stone and another in a Scottish chapel dating over a century 
after the Templars (Colavito 2013a). Aside from the formally dissimilar Scottish 
example, this symbol only existed on the Kensington Stone and a handful of 
post-​Kensington hoaxes. Furthermore, the twelfth-​ through fourteenth-​century 
order of knights, known today as the Templars, had nothing to do with the Grail, 
a twelfth-​century French fictional plot device that had nothing to do in historic 
reality with Jesus. But, if one wanted to attribute the Kensington Stone, and the 
land on which it was found, to an essentially Western and Judeo-​Christian cultural 
pedigree, these nonsensical associations make perfect sense.
At the time of this writing, the majority of the first page Google hits for 
“Kensington Rune Stone” endorse its authenticity. If one follows the Google 
rabbit hole deep enough, one eventually comes to white nationalist sites that 
endorse the stone as evidence of white presence in prehistoric North America. It 
is hardly surprising that the popular view of the object is grossly distorted given 
the difficulty in accessing scientifically accurate information about it.
Even more disturbing is the fact that even some experts have argued recently 
for the stone’s legitimacy. In 1988 Nielsen published a linguistic analysis that 
supported the stone as a legitimate Norse artifact (Nielsen 1988). Nielsen has 
published other articles that argue for the legitimacy of European artifacts in 
pre-​Columbian North America. He has collaborated with Wolters, and “The

97
Epigraphic Society”, established by Barry Fell, author of America B.C. and gener­
ally held to be a pseudohistorian. In short, this recent claim in favor of Kensington 
does not come from a credible linguistic source, but from a source that specializes 
in pseudoscience.
More reliable authorities have also embraced Kensington’s authenticity. Alice 
Kehoe, best known for research on the Native societies of the Midwest, has 
expressed (in Cole et al. 1990; Kehoe 2005) support for its legitimacy. She is 
willing to acknowledge the possibility of Norse presence in the Great Lakes as 
it would explain early eleventh-​century tuberculosis outbreaks among Native 
Americans. Tuberculosis, it is argued, is an Old World affliction, and its evidence 
in prehistoric Native American human remains must indicate some European 
presence in North America at that time.
There are several problems with this argument. First, the idea that tubercu­
losis is a purely Old World disease has been disproved. The timing of the spread 
of the disease across the world is a matter of debate, but it is thought to have 
occurred thousands of years before present. The disease exists in animal reservoirs, 
notably marine mammals (Bos et al. 2014), so there is no need to invoke a pre-​
Columbian European presence in the Midwest. Tubercular seals make a more 
plausible explanation than improbably intrepid Vikings. Once again, we see a 
researcher needlessly multiplying assumptions in an explanation, a violation of 
the parsimony principal.
Also, there is another unstated assumption in terms of chronology. The skeletal 
material showing evidence of tuberculosis is of early eleventh-​century age, and 
thus could have been deposited up to a century before known archaeological 
settlement of Newfoundland and documentary evidence from the Icelandic sagas. 
You would have to assume that Norse explorers were active in the Midwest almost 
immediately upon arriving in the New World, which multiplies the implausibility 
of the claim. Finally, there is the alleged date of the stone itself, almost four cen­
turies after the human remains in question. Why would Norse explorers around 
a.d. 1000 leave a stone inscribed with the year 1362? And how could they have 
done so using a decimal number system that would not be used by Norse for cen­
turies? This is using a nineteenth-​century fake of a fourteenth-​century artifact to 
explain an eleventh-​century epidemic.
Feder (2018:129) points to the underlying critical weakness that any purely 
epigraphic or document-​based faces: a lack of corroborating physical evidence. 
Despite archaeological investigations at the site of the stone’s discovery, and arch­
aeological surveys in the general vicinity, there has never been any material evi­
dence of Norse presence in the region.
…no discarded or lost Norse tools or weapons, no fireplace where they 
cooked their food, and no skeletons of any of the ten men killed at that spot 
where the stone was erected. Simply stated, no additional archaeological 
evidence has been found that might lend support to the claim that a band 
 
 
 

98  Pseudolinguistics

98
of Norse was present in Minnesota more than 100 years before Columbus’s 
first voyage to the Caribbean.
This total absence of corroborating material culture in the Midwest compares 
poorly with the widely distributed Norse artifacts found in Newfoundland and 
Northeastern Canada during known Norse occupation (Feder 2019:66). In the 
absence of any material corroboration of an inscription like Kensington, even if 
the numerous linguistic anomalies were not a factor, by far the greatest probability 
is that it was a hoax. If one is dealing with a claim based on a historical document, 
you need some sort of corroboration either in the form of additional documents, 
or physical evidence. In the case of Kensington, we have neither.
Kensington is hardly the only epigraphic hoax in the Americas. There are 
numerous less well-​known examples of allegedly Norse runestones, the Spirit 
Pond stones being just one example. All of these have been shown to be incon­
sistent with Medieval Scandinavian runic systems and are modern hoaxes. One 
such hoax was eventually admitted to be by medieval studies graduate students 
who overestimated the critical faculties of the general public and had not expected 
their hoax to be accepted as legitimate (Colavito 2015). The students in question 
did eventually own up to the joke, but the episode does show how careful 
academics must be to avoid giving credibility to pseudoscientific concepts.
Another “tradition” of epigraphic hoaxes also involves the creation of inscriptions 
in Old World languages allegedly from prehistoric New World contexts. However, 
instead of Norse runes, these objects feature inscriptions in Hebrew. The most 
famous of these are the “Newark Holy Stones” from Ohio. Allegedly discovered 
over a period of time by David Wyrick in 1860, these artifacts featured Hebrew 
inscriptions including the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments from the Old 
Testament (Figure 5.4). The Newark Earthworks, where the stones were sup­
posedly found, dates to between 100 b.c. and a.d. 500, obviously well prior to 
any accepted Old World presence in the Americas. The Hebrew inscriptions of the 
earliest stones discovered, however, were written in a form of Hebrew that wasn’t 
standardized until the nineteenth century. Stones discovered later were more lin­
guistically antique, though suspiciously this was after the earlier discoveries had 
been shown to be modern (Feder 2019:76–​77). The Decalogue stone also features 
marks from a modern metal grinding wheel on its reverse face. Like Kensington, 
the Newark stones have been featured on TV, again presented by Scott Wolter in 
this case supposedly related to a North American resting place for the Ark of the 
Covenant. And like Kensington, the Newark stones are a nineteenth-​century hoax 
(Colavito 2013c; Lepper 2013).
Other Hebrew inscriptions have been “discovered” such as the Los Lunas 
Decalogue stone from New Mexico (a probable nineteenth/​early twentieth hoax) 
and the Bat Creek stone from Tennessee. All were proven to be fakes, either due 
to featuring Hebrew characters not consistent with those used during the biblical 
era, or due to being of obviously modern manufacture (Feder 2019). None have 
 
 
 

Pseudolinguistics  99
98
99
been associated with any corroborating material culture or absolute dates, or are 
likely intrusive to their context (i.e., they were recently made artifacts “inserted” 
into legitimate archaeological sites; such was likely the case for Bat Creek for 
example). All have enjoyed widespread acceptance by individuals with an ideo­
logical commitment to showing early Old World (white) presence in the Americas 
well prior to Columbus.
In some examples the initial hoax may have been well-​intentioned: Ohman, 
if he created Kensington, was likely trying to bolster the ethnic heritage of his 
ancestors. Wyrick, while likely involved in the Newark stones’ creation, didn’t have 
the linguistic ability to forge the stones. But the man he had translate the stone, the 
Reverend John McCarty, certainly did, and it is plausible that he was also involved. 
In McCarty’s case he was probably attempting to provide evidence that all humans 
are God’s creation and thus slavery was immoral (Feder 2019:75). The Los Lunas 
stone may have been a pious fraud on the part of nineteenth-​century Mormons. 
Unfortunately, whatever the intentions behind their creation, these hoaxes today 
serve as tools to belittle claims of Native Americans to their Native soil and lend 
support to white supremacist narratives and rank pseudoscience.

BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND 
PSEUDOSCIENCE
The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis
The subfield of biological anthropology, particularly the study of human evolution, 
has seen significant change since its birth. It was only in the 1950s that Piltdown 
Man was shown to be a hoax. Africa was accepted as the home of the earliest stages 
of human evolution only in the 1960s following discoveries of specimens in East 
and South Africa. And well toward the end of the twentieth century, the version 
of human evolution taught was decidedly linear, with Australopithecines evolving 
into larger brained Homo habilus, which gave way to Homo erectus, and finally Homo 
sapiens, with relatively few “side branches” to spoil the picture.
So much has changed in such a short time! Recent decades have seen a plethora 
of new species identified as part of our lineage. The human “family tree” is now 
more of a bush, with numerous branches, often with numerous human ancestors 
coexisting for millennia. The picture of our species’ development is far more com­
plex than had been imagined even short time ago.
With complexity of interpretations comes disagreement about the specifics 
of those interpretations. It would be fair to say that the field of human origins 
is among the most contentious fields of science today. The professional stakes 
are high, the egos are often large, and the data is fragmentary enough to allow 
for a diversity of plausible interpretations. This diversity can look as if the 
foundations of human evolution are shaky, and that the narrative of human 
development lacks firm evidence. This is not the case; it is simply how science 
works. Ideas are “crash tested” against one another until one fails to break, and 
that becomes the consensus. Portraying the diversity of interpretations within 
that consensus as a lack of general understanding is at best misguided, and at 
worst disingenuous.
Pseudoscientific ideas have enjoyed popularity among those who portray scien­
tific diversity as a lack of consensus. Creationists arguing for a literal interpretation 
 
 

Biological Anthropology and Pseudoscience  101

of the Bible, for example, have falsely portrayed evolutionary theory as a con­
troversial topic, and “intelligent design” as a viable alternative. They have seized 
upon the presence of gaps in scientific data as somehow discrediting the entirety 
of science. Gaps in the fossil record are presented as invalidating the entirety of 
the consensus on human origins. These are two logical fallacies in action: false 
balance, the erroneous assertion that undue consideration should be given to bad 
explanations simply because the best explanations available aren’t perfect, and the 
God of the gaps argument, which posits that gaps in evidence leave room for 
pseudoscientific arguments. In any thriving science there will be some disagree­
ment regarding the interpretation of data, and the available data will never be all 
a scientist might want to address a question. This in no way discredits the broad 
consensus that exists within any mature science.
Within the field of human evolution, there is broad consensus that populations 
of arboreal African apes gradually became terrestrial and bipedal, developed large 
brains and complex culture. This transformation took place between approxi­
mately ten million and two and a half million years ago. Prior to that period, 
African apes were tree-​dwelling quadrupeds with brains the size of a modern 
chimpanzee; after, there was at least one genus (Homo) that were terrestrial bipeds 
with large brains. This consensus is not questioned by most scientists, and those 
that do are glaringly out of step with mainstream science. While questions remain 
as to the timing, species diversity, the significance of specific adaptations, and the 
selective pressures that drove those adaptations, there is general agreement on this 
consensus.
Regrettably, the fossil record for the vital period in question is not ideal. I have 
heard it said by paleoanthropologists that all the specimens, every single bone, for 
hominins within the period in question would fit on one or two dining room 
tables. Most of these come from two regions in Africa: the East African Rift Valley, 
where volcanic deposits preserve specimens, and Southern Africa, where fossils 
are preserved in limestone caves. Fossil preservation for the rest of the continent 
were not sufficient to preserve enough specimens in any appreciable quantity. The 
lack of fossil evidence is especially bad for between ten and five million years ago. 
New discoveries are made every year, and the gaps in the human fossil record are 
slowly being filled, but substantial lacunae in the data are likely to persist. This is 
not unusual, as any science that depends on data preserved from the past will have 
only a partial record.
The consensus on the broad strokes of human evolution has not stopped 
pseudoscientific ideas in direct contradiction to that consensus from becoming 
widespread. Probably the best known of these is the “aquatic ape” hypothesis. 
While the idea of an aquatic stage of human evolution has been around since the 
early twentieth century, its origin is most closely associated with marine biologist 
Aliester Hardy in the 1960s (Hardy 1977). Though widely derided by scientists, 
the concept has maintained a degree of popularity in the public due in large part 
to its presentation by popular media.

Hardy was a complex individual, who held a mix of scientific and nonscientific 
ideas. On one hand, he was a renowned expert on marine animals and ecosystems 
and made significant contributions to marine biology. On the other, he was also 
known for unscientific hypotheses, for example that evolutionary changes might 
be guided by telepathy, and that animals could share a “group mind”. These ideas 
were linked by a general belief in “vitalism”, which is a common pseudoscientific 
belief in a vital energy within living things. Vitalism underlies many pseudomedical 
practices, such as acupuncture or reiki. Any vitalistic belief is fundamentally flawed, 
as no such innate energy has ever been demonstrated or measured, or even rigor­
ously defined.
Hardy claimed to have first considered the idea that humans passed through 
an aquatic stage of evolutionary development as early as 1930 but did not publish 
then out of (justifiable) fear that it would be ridiculed by the academic commu­
nity. The idea is both simple and seemingly plausible to nonexperts. Humans are 
apes, but we are unusual in comparison to other apes in several respects. These 
include obvious differences such as bipedalism and our large brains. Less often 
noted is our relative hairlessness, and our substantial subcutaneous fat, traits we 
share with many marine mammals, but not our ape relatives. Also, humans are 
capable of impressive swimming behavior, which some find odd in an animal that 
evolved in a terrestrial environment. We also have residual interdigital webbing, 
with some being born with substantial atavistic webbing between fingers and 
toes. Only humans, Hardy argued, and marine mammals can voluntarily control 
their breathing. Only aquatic animals (and humans) copulate in a face-​to-​face 
posture. Finally, that most human of traits, obligatory bipedalism, is explained as 
a side effect of the swimming adaptation. Essentially the streamlined body for an 
ideal hominin swimmer supposedly preadapted human ancestors for bipedalism, 
and a period of buoyant wading, provided an intermediary step from four-​ to 
two-​legged locomotion.
These traits, Hardy claimed, can be explained if humans passed through an 
aquatic or semiaquatic stage. Supposedly, at a time of resource scarcity, human 
ancestors moved from inland to coastal habitats and began to specialize in gathering 
marine resources. This encouraged wading behavior to maximize caloric intake 
from the new foraging strategy. Success in wading led to increased reliance on full-​
fledged swimming, with the above-​mentioned biological traits lending a selective 
advantage in the aquatic environment. An added bonus would be protection from 
terrestrial predators.
This hypothesis even provides an explanation for humans’ large brains. The 
shellfish-​rich diet the scenario presupposes would be rich in omega-​3 fatty acids 
that are necessary for brain development. So, increased encephalization (the ratio 
of brain size to body size) developed as a side effect of the aquatic adaptation. 
Increased cognitive capacity allowed greater flexibility and effectiveness at for­
aging, including complex material culture, allowing for a later shift back to a ter­
restrial lifestyle following improvements in the climate. The aquatic ape hypothesis 
 

Biological Anthropology and Pseudoscience  103
102
103
seemingly makes for a tight, plausible narrative and explains the traits that separate 
humans from other primates.
The hypothesis was further popularized by Elaine Morgan (1982, 1987). 
Morgan was a popular writer and columnist but was not a trained scientist. That 
said, her books sold well and led to greater visibility and popularity for the aquatic 
ape idea, despite coming under criticism by high-​profile scientists such as E. O. 
Wilson. Aside from attempting to provide an explanation for human evolution, 
Morgan was also offering a rebuttal to male-​centered evolutionary ideas. Morgan 
associated elements of human reproductive anatomy, including the length of the 
penis, depth of the vagina, frontal sex positions, the presence of a hymen, and the 
absence of estrus, with an aquatic stage of evolution. It is likely that Morgan’s 
writing influenced the BBC (Morgan was Welsh and very popular in the United 
Kingdom) to produce a program entitled The Waterside Ape hosted by David 
Attenborough. The program presented the hypothesis as credible and mainstream, 
and Attenborough’s celebrity status lent significant attention to the concept.
A Belgian physician, Marc Verhaegan, has also been prominent in arguing for 
the hypothesis. Verhaegan has focused on human biological traits he deems incom­
patible with a terrestrial adaptation and use this negative evidence as indicating 
an aquatic history. He has, for example, argued that human body temperature is 
anomalously low, in the range of aquatic mammals (Verhaegan 1991). Verhaegan 
and others have made much of the fact of this supposed anomaly, and the “fact” 
that, unlike other savanna adapted mammals, our body temperature does not 
fluctuate.
The consensus of paleoanthropologists has been generally unified against the 
aquatic ape hypothesis. All the adaptations Hardy and Morgan identify as evi­
dence for an aquatic stage are equally, if not more, explainable in a terrestrial 
environment (see Langdon 1997). Bipedalism is adaptive in an open terrestrial 
environment, allowing for tool use and efficient locomotion, as well as greater 
visibility. The bodily proportions associated with bipedalism, particularly long legs, 
developed late in hominin ancestry, after the supposed aquatic stage. Humans are 
in fact not particularly streamlined, or at least not significantly more so than other 
primates. Human fat deposits are entirely different from aquatic mammals, and 
human children tend to have very low body fat in comparison to juvenile aquatic 
mammals. This is hardly what one would expect from an adaptation to cold water 
temperatures. In fact, immersion in even moderately cool water can lead to hypo­
thermia in humans, especially for children.
Human breath control likely coevolved with the human capacity for speech, 
and as a side effect of bipedalism, as movement of the upper limbs would no 
longer affect the working of the lungs. Numerous other adaptations associated 
with human breathing, proposed by Morgan as holdovers from an aquatic stage, 
are better explained by the development of speech or terrestrial climate. These 
include the anatomy of the pharynx, nose, soft palate, and sinuses. The sinuses, 
supposedly a trait adaptive to keeping the head buoyant in water, are found in 
 
 
 
 

104  Biological Anthropology and Pseudoscience
104
104
numerous ape species besides humans, and mammals that do make a known tran­
sition from land to water tend to lose sinus cavities, not gain them (Rae and 
Koppe 2014).
The list of adaptations better explained in the absence of aquatic evolution goes 
on, and what follows is not a complete list. Loss of body hair was likely a side effect 
of bipedalism, as well as contributing greater efficiency in heat regulation through 
sweating, and in fact we are not really hairless. Scalp hair and male facial hair grows 
continuously if not cut, hardly ideal for streamlining. True hairlessness in mammals 
is limited only to the largest species as a thermoregulatory adaptation. Lack of 
“salt hunger”, eccrine-​gland sweating, and salty tears, allegedly adaptations for salt 
excretion in a marine environment, are all congruent with a terrestrial, subtropical 
environment and high-​endurance locomotion. None of the sexual adaptations 
proposed by Morgan are innate to purely aquatic species, and many are shared 
by terrestrial primates. All tetrapods exhibit digital webbing during fetal develop­
ment, and the trait persists in many terrestrial animals. The large human brain is 
better explained through a variety of selective pressures, including a dependence 
on a varied diet in a resource poor environment, increased dependence on tech­
nology, and a highly complex social organization. And lots of aquatic animals do 
not copulate in a face-​to-​face orientation, and as for humans, suffice it to say that 
face to face is just one of many options.
Omega-​3 fatty acids available from marine foods are also available from a 
terrestrial diet, and they are not nutritionally essential to the degree argued by 
aquatic ape proponents. Much of this argument has come from nutrition experts 
with no expertise in evolutionary biology. Pseudoscientists often will include the 
arguments of scientists to bolster their arguments, but in general these are scientists 
working outside of their core expertise. In this case, a true expert in marine 
ecology would have noted that the types of fish particularly rich in omega-​3’s 
are in fact not widely available in shallow shore environments, but in the deeper 
waters offshore. And what shoreline resources are available would likely have had 
to have been augmented by terrestrial resources, contradicting the central premise 
of the hypothesis.
Regarding Verhaegan and the issue of human body temperature, aquatic 
mammals have temperatures somewhat lower than humans, and other unrelated 
mammals have temperatures that closely match the human range. And human 
temperature is a range, it fluctuates from individual to individual and in indi­
viduals over time. Mammals exhibit a range of thermoregulatory adaptations to 
their environment, and savanna-​adapted mammals are no different. While human 
adaptations are different from, say, an antelope, we both do fine in a hot open 
grassland. And finally, human body temperature is similar to that of other primates, 
not much of an anomaly at all.
Human swimming, while impressive, is not unique. And while some human 
infants have been shown to having a swimming reflex, so do most infant mammals. 
In fact, human infants are far less physically developed than any marine mammal at 
 
 

Biological Anthropology and Pseudoscience  105

birth and would drown in short order. Many mammals can hold their breath, and 
a “diving reflex” is widespread, not limited to aquatic mammals. Many mammal 
species can swim quite well. Tree sloths are apparently quite adept in the water 
but are dedicated tree dwellers. And while humans are decent swimmers, we are 
nowhere near as proficient at it as other marine or semi-​marine mammals. Hardy 
even argued that the human propensity for swimming, and the enjoyment many 
take in aquatic activities, is evidence of a species level desire to return to an ances­
tral environment. This is essentially an argument for a “race memory”, which has 
been proposed on several occasions, but is purely pseudoscience with no plausi­
bility or supporting evidence.
Some arguments for an aquatic past make no sense on even a cursory examin­
ation. For example, the rare pathology of bone spurs in the ear canal, ear exostosis, 
can occur to people who spend a lot of time immersed in water. The condition is 
commonly referred to as “surfer’s ear”. This is supposedly evidence of an aquatic 
past, but in fact it is evidence of the fact that we are not ideally suited for aquatic 
environments. If we were water-​adapted, such pathologies should be less common 
or absent. Also, arguments that an aquatic environment would provide refuge from 
land predators ignores the fact that there are numerous marine predators that 
would likely have been far more threatening during the supposed period of adap­
tation to a new environment.
There is of course the not-​insignificant matter of the fossil record. So far, all 
human fossil specimens have been recovered from what would have been terres­
trial environments.
…throughout most of the hominin evolutionary past, the only association 
with the aquatic world was the exploitation of lake shores and river margins 
as part of local terrestrial faunal communities… there is no evidence of ana­
tomical or physiological adaptations that cannot be explained equally well 
without recourse to aquatic theories….
Foley and Lahr 2014:59
None of the adaptations mentioned by Hardy, Morgan, and others would have 
been purely aquatic in nature. And with the discovery of numerous hominin species 
in the years since Hardy and Morgan popularized the aquatic ape hypothesis, we 
now know that hominins were undeniably terrestrial and bipedal well prior to 
the time frame suggested for an aquatic habitat. The fundamental adaptations that 
make humans human appear in the fossil record sequentially, over a lengthy period, 
while the aquatic ape hypothesis necessitates a compressed and rapid adaptation 
to an aquatic environment. In the end, there is simply no direct physical evidence 
to support the claim, and abundant physical evidence fits the terrestrial consensus.
Morgan referenced the hominid fossil record as supporting the aquatic ape 
hypothesis, since many early hominid fossils were recovered in association with 
marine animals. She noted that the famous Lucy fossil of Australopithecus afarensis 
 

106  Biological Anthropology and Pseudoscience
106
106
was discovered in association with crocodile, turtle, and crab remains (Morgan 
1997). The implication is that association with marine fauna in the same fossil 
context means that Lucy, and A. afarensis in general, was a habitually aquatic 
animal. This ignores numerous complex factors that contribute to any depositional 
context in paleontology. It also ignores the presence of numerous terrestrial fauna. 
Most significantly, it ignores a clear sample bias in the fossil record. You often find 
fossils in what were aquatic environments, not because they lived their habitually, 
but because aquatic environments yield more fossils. Moore notes “Morgan would 
have it that if you die in hospital, you must have spent most of your life there”.
Morgan (1997) attempts to address a fundamental flaw in the aquatic ape hypoth­
esis. Experts have noted that the model does not account for known adaptations 
to that environment. For example, marine mammals exhibit shortening of the 
lower limbs and modification into flippers. This is substantially different from 
the anatomy of the hypothetical aquatic ape that has elongated legs ultimately 
readapted for bipedalism. Morgan argues that the aquatic phase was too short, 
only two or three million years, to allow for such extreme anatomical adaptations.
Moore points out that this is a serious inconsistency. How is it that the aquatic 
phase was long enough to allow some major adaptations, but not others actually 
seen in marine mammals? Moore points out that this is an example of special 
pleading, or the ad hoc rationalization fallacy. Morgan is applying inconsistent 
standards of evidence, generously allowing questionable evidence that supports 
the model while explaining away well-​established facts which contradict it. There 
is the more pressing problem that Morgan was simply wrong in terms of the facts. 
The difference between the last terrestrial ancestor of whales (Pakicetus) and the 
first fully aquatic whale (Ambulicetus) was less than five million years, more than 
enough time to allow for extreme physical adaptations.
Morgan also illustrates her lack of knowledge in her focus on one particular 
trait of great significance to the aquatic ape hypothesis: our lack of body hair. 
Attempts to explain human hairlessness purely in terms of ecological adaptations 
are most likely misguided or incomplete. Darwin, for example, in The Descent 
of Man, explained hairlessness not through natural selection but through sexual 
selection. Even while hairlessness likely played a role in thermal regulation (in a 
terrestrial environment), the difference in body hair between males and females 
indicates a sexual component.
As an aside, pseudoscientists often misquote or selectively quote Darwin only 
reporting those sections of his works that seem to illustrate their own arguments. 
This is of course the fallacy of cherry-​picking, only selecting the evidence that 
supports your hypothesis. It is also evidence that they have never actually read 
Darwin in the original or they would realize the Darwin often used “devil’s advo­
cate” statements that seem to argue against natural selection as entry points into 
explanations of how the process worked. Presenting only those introductory 
statement as evidence of Darwin’s true intention is at best ignorant and at worst 
disingenuous.

Even if you grant the possible aquatic adaptations listed above, the aquatic 
ape hypothesis suffers from fatal flaws in terms of evolutionary theory and epis­
temology. Moore (2019) argues the hypothesis is based on extreme ecological 
determinism, where a given environment requires a narrow range of adaptations. 
In fact, any environment, aquatic, or terrestrial, can be adapted to in different 
ways. Evolution doesn’t play favorites so long as an organism fares well against its 
competitors. Also, just because an animal is capable of a behavior doesn’t mean 
that it specifically evolved to do that activity. The hyper-​functionalist assumption 
that every trait had to have a specific adaptive value is a gross oversimplification. 
Moore succinctly states:
[The aquatic ape hypothesis] claims to use the principle of convergent evo­
lution, but does so in a strange and unscientific way: first, they use it only 
in cases where they want to (inaccurately) claim similarity of features, not 
when it is evidence against their theory (as in the case of the actual ubiqui­
tous aquatic features); and their version of convergence ignores the role of 
phylogeny (relatedness) in evolution (as in expecting humans to use rep­
tilian or avian salt glands for salt excretion instead of kidneys as all mammals 
do). Since phylogeny is the central idea in evolution, this places their theory 
not only outside the mainstream, but indeed outside of all evolutionary the­
orizing for the past half century or more.
The hypothesis also is based on an unlikely chain of evolutionary events; it 
supposes two major habitat adaptations in rapid succession, from terrestrial to 
aquatic and back to purely terrestrial in only a few million years. In the absence 
of direct evidence of any aquatic stage in our history, and with purely terrestrial 
explanations available, it makes no sense to claim an aquatic shift ever occurred. 
Also, while the theory supposes the initial move to the water was in response to 
a climatic deterioration inland, it does not provide any reasonable explanation for 
the required move back to land. It is argued that aquatic hominins moved back to 
land in response to improving environmental conditions, but that would not pro­
vide any selective pressure to move out of an environmental niche that they would 
have by then been well adapted to inhabit. Hawkes notes:
…the Aquatic Ape Theory explains all of these features, but it explains them 
all twice. Every one of the features encompassed by the theory still requires 
a reason for it to be maintained after hominids left the aquatic environment.
Hawkes 2005; http://​johnha​wks.net, accessed 10/​27/​2019
It is almost as if terrestrial habitation is treated as a default that runs counter to evo­
lutionary theory. This would violate the economy of natural selection. Evolution 
doesn’t operate according to a design; it works with what is available. If humans 
had taken to an aquatic environment, once aquatic adaptations occurred, we would 
 
 

108  Biological Anthropology and Pseudoscience
108
108
have been stuck with them and would in all probability have remained an aquatic 
species. The various species that have been used as analogies for our supposedly 
aquatic adaptations, mostly marine mammals, share a common trait: they’re still 
there. Evolution generally doesn’t let you go home again.
The most comprehensive critique of the aquatic ape hypothesis was made 
by Langdon in 1997. Langdon argued that the hypothesis violates the principle 
of parsimony in explanations in that it invokes unnecessary complications and 
assumptions over “conventional” hypotheses. He argues that the hypothesis is 
an “umbrella hypothesis” that seeks to explain a myriad of data with a single 
causal explanation. Such an explanation feels parsimonious, but in fact contains 
numerous hidden assumptions that violate the principle.
Occam’s Razor or the parsimony principle states, “entities must not be multi­
plied without necessity” (Novella et al. 2018:157). One should not introduce 
unnecessary assumptions in any explanation. So, while attributing multiple elem­
ents of human anatomy to a single cause, a past aquatic environment, feels simpler 
and thus more believable, you are in fact introducing a range of assumptions not 
supported by any evidence. Unfortunately, “simple answers, however wrong, are 
easier to communicate and are more readily accepted than the more sound but 
more complex solutions” (Langdon 1997:479).
Umbrella hypotheses tend to be quite popular on the fringes of science and in 
popular media. Humans are hardwired to prefer simple, easily communicated ideas 
over complexity and nuance. Modern media with its emphasis on entertainment 
over education and sound bite communication exacerbates this tendency, and sim­
plistic explanations of complex phenomena are rampant in the public sphere. It is 
the job of science to discredit them whenever possible.
The knocking back of attractive-​but-​wrong explanations of the world, how­
ever, has been the raison d’etre of science from the start. After all, “common 
sense” is always the former, but rarely the latter.
Rae and Koppe 2014:63
It has also been noted that the aquatic ape hypothesis lacks internal coherence 
and clarity. Many of the adaptations of the aquatic ape contradict one another, 
occasionally even within a single researcher’s work. One could say it isn’t a single 
hypothesis at all but a collection of speculative scenarios that only share some 
aquatic phase of hominin evolution. Originally as framed by Hardy and Morgan, 
this aquatic phase was alleged to have taken place early in the evolution of the ape 
lineage, millions of years prior to the existence of any animal that could reasonably 
be called human. But more recent treatments have focused on hominins as recent 
as Homo erectus (Vaneechoutte et al. 2011). And ecological scenarios range from 
habitual, fully aquatic habitats (not supported by the fossil record) to opportunistic 
wading and waterside foraging (which would not require substantial adaptations). 
Some scenarios require habitual salt water, others continual access to fresh water,

or shifts over an individual animal’s lifespan, from aquatic to terrestrial and back 
to aquatic, to explain changing body fat proportions over the life cycle. A model 
that cites both whales and rhinoceroses as equally relevant examples of convergent 
evolution to aquatic environments, be it deep ocean or muddy wallows, is wildly 
incoherent. This lack of internal consistency and clarity is further indication that 
the entire argument is far more speculative than data driven.
A recent article by Foley and Lahr (2014) raises other characteristics that 
place the hypothesis in the realm of pseudoscience. Research into the hypothesis 
takes place in isolation, “hermetically sealed”, with researchers avoiding engage­
ment with their critics. This results in an echo chamber, where the common 
misapprehensions of the group amplify each other and make proponents more 
convinced of their ideas even in the face of a lack of corroborating data. Research 
cited by aquatic ape proponents is typically dated and obsolete, presumably because 
current research would not support their beliefs. Moore has noted a tendency to 
“incestuous citing” where a group of like-​minded (but wrong) researchers all 
cite each other, giving a false impression of widespread support for ideas that 
are widely rejected. When contradictory evidence is acknowledged, it tends to 
be misrepresented as if it actually confirms the hypothesis, further rendering the 
aquatic argument immune to refutation.
Some aquatic ape proponents have compared themselves to misunderstood 
geniuses who proposed heterodox theories but were eventually proven correct. 
Aquatic ape researchers often claim their work is ignored or suppressed by “main­
stream” scientists, claiming a conspiracy against them. Rather than proving their 
argument with evidence, they try to shift the burden of proof onto their critics, 
challenging them to prove the theory wrong. They shift definitions of (what is an 
“aquatic ape”), “moving the goalpost” rather than confronting criticism. These 
are all traits of pseudoscience that has led some (e.g., Gee 2013) to argue that 
aquatic ape researchers should simply be ignored. The problem is that pseudo­
science doesn’t go away if ignored, it flourishes and does more damage.
We can conclude by asking what harm has the aquatic ape hypothesis done? In 
the end, the academic damage done by the aquatic ape hypothesis has been min­
imal. The concept has been roundly dismissed by the consensus of anthropology. 
However, it has done real damage in terms of degrading popular scientific literacy. 
Hardy and Morgan were celebrity popularizers of science, both recognized by 
the British Crown for their efforts. This likely had an “argument from celebrity” 
effect where ideas presented in popular media by famous people are given cred­
ibility beyond their supporting evidence and expertise. Hardy was an expert on 
plankton, while Morgan had a bachelor’s equivalent in English.
Recently, aquatic ape proponents, rather than providing new or compelling 
evidence, have instead tended to attack their critics, arguing that the “savanna 
hypothesis” is also not a complete explanation of human adaptations. This is a 
“twofer” of logical fallacies. First, it is a tu quoque (for “you also”) fallacy, where 
one criticizes another for making the same errors you yourself are making. More

significantly it is a straw man argument, as the modern synthesis of human evo­
lution acknowledges hominins evolved in diverse habitats, in wetlands, grasslands, 
and forests. The idea of a purely open grassland adaptation has long been discarded. 
In attempting to damage the reputation of their critics, they reveal their own poor 
reasoning and unfamiliarity with the current consensus.
The worst offense of public media with regards to the aquatic ape hypothesis 
to date occurred in 2012 when the Discovery Networks channel Animal Planet 
aired Mermaids: the Body Found. This was, at the time, the most popular program 
ever carried by the Discovery Networks (Schiele 2020:3). The program seemed 
to be a legitimate educational documentary presenting evidence of the existence 
of mermaids. The aquatic ape hypothesis was presented as legitimate evidence for 
mermaids. Only at the end was a disclaimer presented as to the program’s fictional 
content. While this may sound like a harmless exercise, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration was sufficiently alarmed as to issue a statement to the 
effect that mermaids were not real. While many would excuse such programming 
as harmless entertainment, they contribute to the erosion of public understanding 
of science.
Langdon (1997:492–​493) suggests relevant arguments why pseudoscientific 
hypotheses are more popular than their scientific counterparts. As already 
mentioned, they tend to be simple and easily communicated, and seemingly 
(though falsely) parsimonious. For all its many weaknesses, the aquatic ape hypoth­
esis makes for a compelling narrative, as does the image of iconoclastic outsiders 
arguing against closed-​minded skeptics. Science is complicated, often ambiguous, 
and often difficult to explain to listeners lacking the relevant expertise. Coming 
from outside an authoritative consensus, pseudoscience often appeals to a popular 
sense of rebellion, rejection of authority, and anti-​intellectualism. And they often 
are insinuated in areas where science has yet to fill in all the gaps in the data, the 
God of the gaps gambit.
One can see all of these factors affecting public discussions of evolution today. 
Despite being roundly discredited by the consensus of evolutionary science the 
aquatic ape hypothesis is far from dead. Elain Morgan presented it as current 
research in a 2009 TED presentation, which as the time of this writing had 
garnered over 400,000 views. Phillip Tobias, an eminent paleoanthropologist, 
has offered support of some aspects of the hypothesis, though it would be an 
overstatement to say he was a proponent. Another prominent writer who has 
expressed some sympathy for the hypothesis is philosopher Daniel Dennett. In any 
event, invoking the names of prominent individuals is simply an argument from 
authority, not evidence.
A 2019 text presents the argument in terms little changed from when it was 
first proposed by Hardy nearly 60 years earlier (Rhys-​Evans 2019c), so it seems 
that the aquatic ape hypothesis is not going anywhere anytime soon. Pseudoscience 
often exhibits this “whack-​a-​mole” problem. No matter how many times a 
pseudoscientific concept is debunked, no matter how publicly it is discredited, it

can always pop back up again a generation later, often unchanged from its original 
character. When it comes to confronting pseudoscience, the job of the scientist is 
never done. Science is a product that must be maintained, and pseudoscience is the 
gradual corrosion of that product. Like rust creeping into a complex mechanism, it 
must be continually addressed. This new resurgence of the aquatic ape hypothesis 
aptly illustrates this.

PSEUDOARCHAEOLOGY AND 
ANCIENT ALIENS
The probability of the existence of intelligent life in our galaxy was proposed 
by cosmologist Frank Drake in 1961. Drake proposed a probability equation 
based on known or hypothetical values that added up the likelihood of intelligent 
civilizations in our galaxy that could be plausibly identified. Calculating Drake’s 
Equation with the most conservative values, shows that it is probable there are or 
have been numerous extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way.
We must then consider the question most memorably posed by physicist 
Enrico Fermi, “why haven’t we heard from them?”, now referred to as the “Fermi 
Paradox”. Many possible answers haven been proposed. However, most have been 
proposed by UFO enthusiasts starting from the assumption that extraterrestrial 
beings are routinely visiting our planet. From this starting, unsupported assumption, 
they then cherry pick evidence that lends support to their belief. Since the Fermi 
Paradox contradicts the UFO belief system, it must be undermined. This usually 
proceeds by special pleading arguments: aliens are real, but they follow something 
like Start Trek’s “prime directive” where advanced beings do not interfere with 
more primitive ones. Aliens are real, and they have quarantined our region of space 
into a “cosmic zoo”. Aliens are real, but they are hiding from us, for opaque, alien 
reasons. All these explanations fail a basic logical test: they introduce additional 
assumptions not required by existing evidence, violating once again the parsimony 
principle. They seek to provide reasons why someone’s favored assumption should 
be exempt from the usual rules of evidence for science.
It is possible to resolve the contradiction between Drake and Fermi without 
introducing baseless assumptions. The galaxy is big and has been around for a long 
time. The speed of light, the fastest pace at which communication or travel can 
take place, is laughably slow considering the huge gulfs of space to even the nearest 
stars. Any travel between our star and another would take eons to accomplish.

Even communication would take centuries for even the most basic exchange. 
Where are the aliens? They may be out there but isolated from us by an abyss 
of space.
My point discussing this is that believing in the existence of aliens, and even 
searching for evidence of them, is not by itself pseudoscience. Critics of the search 
for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) program have said that, while it may not be 
purely pseudoscientific, it is also a field in search of data. Still, logical evaluation of 
the premises of SETI must conclude that there is nothing implausible about the 
concept behind it.
Where many have enthusiastically leapt into the realm of pseudoscience has 
been the belief that aliens we may logically conclude are out there somewhere, have 
come here, and have meddled in the affairs of, if not the evolution of, humanity.
The idea of intelligent aliens visiting the Earth is hardly new; Giordano Bruno 
speculated on the existence of aliens in 1584 (Bruno 2014). The idea was less 
popular in the sixteenth century and Bruno was burned at the stake, though prob­
ably more for his denial of Christ’s divinity. The idea of alien presence and visit­
ation has seen surges in popularity. In The Book of the Damned (1919:164), Charles 
Fort wrote:
If other worlds have ever in the past had relations with this earth, they were 
attempted positivations: to extend themselves, by colonies, upon this earth; 
to convert, or assimilate, indigenous inhabitants of this earth.
Fort was a proponent of a range of bizarre ideas; his very name is now invoked 
to describe paranormal phenomenon: “Fortean”. But his argument regarding the 
likelihood of past alien visitation, and the goals of those aliens, presaged modern 
preoccupations.
Stories of alien visitations rise and fall in frequency with trends in popular 
culture. Alien craft were apparently quite common in our skies during the post-​
World War II years, which were not coincidentally the “golden age” of science 
fiction literature and film. The birth of modern “blockbuster” science fiction films 
such as Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind in the 1970s sparked a similar 
surge in supposed sightings and abductions.
This is not a book about alien encounters, however. Carl Sagan’s aphorism 
“extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” (which he made in direct 
response to the stories of “abductees”) applies. So far, there have been many extra­
ordinary claims, but no extraordinary evidence.
The question of possible contact with alien civilizations enters the realm 
of anthropology with hypotheses that such contact may have occurred prehis­
torically and may have influenced the origin and/​or development of ancient 
civilization. Sagan suggested in 1966 that this was a possibility science should 
consider (Sagan and Shklovskii 1966), and Soviet scientists considered the idea 
before Sagan (Feder 2018:187). There have been numerous pseudoscientific

writers who have argued that such prehistoric alien contact occurred. This is 
an extreme version of a hyper-​diffusionary argument where all great works of 
culture have one ancient origin, just in this case the origin is extraterrestrial in 
nature (Moshenka 2017:126).
The claims of the alien contact hypothesis have been convincingly refuted. 
The easiest point to disprove is the idea that extraterrestrial beings played a 
role in human evolution, breeding with early hominins to create human–​alien 
hybrids (Cole 1980:11). This claim may be discarded simply based on the dif­
ficulties in forming interspecific hybrids between Earth animals, which at least 
share a common ancestor (MacLaurin 1973:33). The idea of a hybrid with an 
organism from an entirely different biology is laughable, as was summarized by 
Carl Sagan: “I think the chance of a man mating with a petunia is much greater 
than the chance of him being able to mate, much less produce offspring, with an 
inhabitant of another planet” (People, March 3/​18/​1974).
Supposedly evidence of hybrids has been demonstrated to be fraudulent, or 
physical anomalies. The “Starchild Skull”, argued by Lloyd Pye to be that of an 
alien–​human hybrid child, has been shown to be a human who suffered from a 
congenital disease. A tiny skeleton recovered from the Atacama Desert of Chile, 
claimed again to be an alien or alien hybrid, has been shown to be a human 
fetus, again suffering from genetic pathology. Science fiction media, such as the 
film 2001: A Space Odyssey, or alien/​human hybrid characters like Star Trek’s Mr. 
Spock, have prepared the average information consumer to accept this ludicrous 
claim. That said, most of such pseudoscience has focused on alleged evidence of 
past alien visitations and contact.
The association of aliens and the archaeological past can be traced largely to the 
work of Erich von Däniken. Von Däniken was born in Switzerland in 1934. As an 
adult he served short prison sentences for fraud. He later embarked on a career as a 
hotelier, but also had a lifelong interest in astronomy and the UFO phenomenon. 
In 1964 he published an article suggesting such a visit, and in 1968 he published 
Chariots of the Gods? that remains one of the bestselling volumes of pseudoscience, 
having sold 63 million copies in 32 languages. The book was made into a German 
language television documentary in 1970, which was broadcast in the United 
States in 1973 on NBC, the first pseudoscientific TV documentary in the United 
States (Schiele 2020:2). The volume and program are riddled with factual errors 
and misrepresentations, but more insidious is the faulty logic von Däniken used in 
framing his arguments.
Chariots opens with a preemptive strike against archaeology. In the opening 
chapter, von Däniken levels what was intended as a scathing critique of archae­
ology. Archaeology is “a simple matter of excavation” and “mere collection and 
classification”. Chariots was intended to remedy this limitation by finally bringing 
additional scientific fields of study and interpreting the origins and meanings of 
ancient cultures. Given the poor public understanding of archaeology this prob­
ably seemed convincing, and it is a clever rhetorical gambit. In a few sentences 
 
 
 
 

Pseudoarchaeology and Ancient Aliens  115

115
he dismisses the relevance of the only science dedicated to understanding human 
prehistory and sets his own interpretations as the only scientific alternative.
Omahundro (1976) critiqued this strategy as a straw man argument (or a 
“straw horse” in Omohundro’s words). Von Däniken’s argument might have had 
some relevance to archaeology if he’d made it 20 years earlier, when archaeology 
was still in its infancy, and much of an archaeologist’s effort was directed toward 
description and classification. But in the late 1960s, archaeology was undergoing a 
scientific revolution, and using cutting edge technology to explain the anthropo­
logical meaning of ancient remains the order of the day. In describing archaeology 
as purely descriptive he grossly misrepresented archaeology’s goals and methods.
This is hardly the only straw horse in von Däniken’s stable. Archaeologists in his 
description are not just mired in description, but they are dogmatically attached to 
their preferred explanation (the fact that this contradicts his point that archaeologists 
don’t seek to explain anything notwithstanding). The advanced degrees and years 
of schooling behind them contribute to this dogmatism, brainwashing academics 
into mindlessly presenting a party line (Arnold 2006b:157). This attack on 
expertise regrettably resonates with many (Sokal 2006:332).
However appealing to nonexperts, this is again a misrepresenting oversimplifi­
cation. Archaeologists do change their interpretations considering new evidence 
all the time (something a pseudoscientist never does), and there are entire books 
and courses about the transformation in archaeological theories over history as 
new data and ideas have come to light. But miscasting academic archaeologists as 
close-​minded dogmatists allows the pseudoarchaeologist to play the victim. Fagan 
(2006:33) writes:
All good stories benefit from a villain, and pseudoarchaeologists like to pos­
ition themselves as the powerless and heroic underdogs tackling a faceless 
and arrogant establishment. Their ideas gain a certain romantic cachet 
thereby.
Von Däniken makes abundant use of other fallacious arguments. He peppers 
his writing with red herrings, non sequitur arguments that are generally true 
statements, but which are irrelevant to the argument. He makes repeated 
arguments for the importance of evidence-​based research, especially in the study 
of space. He argues against the relevance of religiously motivated thinking in 
science. He argues for the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in research. 
These are all valid points but are also immaterial to his arguments regarding past 
extraterrestrial visitations. The purpose of such arguments is to draw attention 
away from the implausibility and inaccuracy of his work. The evidence he refers 
to is of universally poor quality and generally misrepresented; his arguments, and 
the doggedness with which he clings to them, have more in common with reli­
gion than science; and he rejects the fundamental findings of the very disciplines 
he seeks to emulate.

116
Von Däniken further seeks to head off criticism by characterizing scientists as 
elitist and close-​minded (Cole 1980:2). This is a prime example of an ad hom­
inem, seeking to discredit someone’s argument based not on the evidence but on 
the identity of the person. This is not to say that scientists can’t be close minded, 
or elitist, but this generalization is not true of the majority of scientists, and in any 
event being close minded or elitist does not make someone wrong. If scientists’ 
minds are closed, they are closed to arguments without supporting evidence or 
plausibility, and if they are elitist, it is because they know myriad details that dis­
credit von Däniken’s work.
Lewis (2012:215) notes that part of von Däniken’s strategy is to not engage 
with legitimate scientists:
Von Däniken’s disengagement with archaeology represents an end-​run 
around academic science by appealing to a more basic form of commonsense 
rationality. In other words, von Däniken points to these concrete, phys­
ical monuments from the ancient past, and offers a seemingly reasonable 
explanation that makes logical sense to his audience. As long as one accepts 
von Däniken’s fundamental premise about ancient alien visitors, then his 
explanations come across as completely rational.
Rather than arguing with scientists, von Däniken ignores science, and can assume 
that a significant portion of his readership are sufficiently science-​ignorant that 
they will accept his broken logic in place of scientific arguments.
Von Däniken’s specific arguments follow one of two general patterns. For one, 
he would pick a particularly elaborate construction of an ancient civilization, 
argue that the ancient culture in question lacked the means or knowledge to com­
plete such a project, and conclude some assistance must have been rendered by 
extraterrestrial visitors. Omohundro (1976:62) and later Feder (2018:197) derides 
such arguments as “our ancestors, the dummies”. Omohundro provides numerous 
quotes from Chariots that show the disdainful, ethnocentric, and racist assumptions 
of the author. In von Däniken’s view:
…up until the last thousand years or so the world was filled with primitives, 
heathens, savages, dummies. Their intelligence matched their simple tech­
nologies; their languages were simple, their cultures were primitives, they 
were brutes. If they seem to have come up with something quite fantastic 
by our standards, someone smarter than them must have given it to them.
Cole (1980:10) also critiques this sentiment, noting not only the pessimistic 
view of the past inherent in the ancient astronaut hypothesis but also the implied 
racism in the geographic distribution of ancient cultures in supposed need of alien 
assistance.
 
 

Pseudoarchaeology and Ancient Aliens  117
116
117
There is a certain misanthropism implicit in a scenario that must appeal to 
nonhuman sources for an explanation of human technological successes.
Omohundro noted a range of problematic assumptions in Chariots. Seemingly 
Caucasoid depictions were deemed incongruous with “primitive” societies, 
implying only ancient people of color were primitive. Ancient peoples are implied 
as unimaginative, and incapable of innovation. Mesoamerican cultures such as 
the Maya were deemed suspiciously advanced for “jungle people”. The idea of 
reincarnation was foreign to “heathen” peoples and must have come from more 
advanced sources. Paleolithic humans were too “primitive” and “savage” to have 
created elaborate art works. They were “without tools”, granting the status of 
“tool” only to modern, Western technology.
The ideal exemplar of von Däniken’s problematic view of ancient culture is 
his explanation of the monumental architecture of ancient Egypt. The three large 
pyramids including the Great Pyramid of Khufu (aka, Cheops), as well as associated 
structures, are part of a large complex termed the Giza Necropolis. As the name 
implies, these structures form an enormous complex of pyramids, tombs, and 
other monuments, such as the Great Sphinx, all built during the Fourth Dynasty, 
dating from 2613 to 2494 b.c.e. Von Däniken has argued that the entire Egyptian 
civilization had to have an external, extraterrestrial origin, due to the suddenness 
with which it appeared, and due to the advanced nature of Egyptian technology.
The Great Pyramid has been particularly subject to von Däniken’s speculation 
(Figure 7.1). At nearly 140 meters in height, the structure was the tallest human-​
made structure until the early fourteenth century. At over 6 million tons (Von 
Däniken himself overestimates this figure by a factor of five), and 2.3 million 
stone blocks weighing approximately 2–​3 tons a piece, it is still one of the most 
massive objects ever created. Von Däniken’s arguments regarding this monument 
have called attention to its sudden and unprecedented construction, the magni­
tude of its construction, supposed mathematical constants found in its dimensions, 
and the degree of precision exhibited in its orientation. The pyramid supposedly 
sits at the geographic center of the world’s land masses (Colavito 2012a). All these 
points are either misrepresented or false.
Neither Egyptian society, nor the Great Pyramid, were sudden or unprece­
dented manifestations (Baker 1973:64). The Great Pyramid was constructed during 
the Fourth Dynasty, which of course implies the existence of three preceding 
dynasties. The Old Kingdom of Egypt arose out of a centuries-​long tradition of 
increasing cultural complexity along the Nile River that culminated in the unifi­
cation of southern and northern Egypt in approximately 3100 b.c.e. Likewise, the 
Great Pyramid was not unprecedented, and there is a known sequence of pyramid 
construction in Egypt, starting with box tombs called mustabas, followed by step 
pyramids, essentially stacks of mustabas, varying attempts to achieve a true pyramid 
such as the Bent Pyramid at Dahsure, and finally the true pyramids at Giza. This 
experimentation and perfection of the pyramid design took nearly a century.

Egyptologists were aware of these developmental trends when von Däniken wrote 
his book. He just chose not to reference the consensus of Egyptology.
Then there is von Däniken’s statements that there is no evidence of how the 
Great Pyramid was constructed, and that the Egyptians themselves would have 
been incapable of its construction. There are no quarries, no workers housing, 
no tools. This lack of evidence is then presented, in an argument from ignorance, 
combined with an argument from incredulity, that some alternative, extraordinary 
explanation is necessary. Gauld (1973:20) noted his use of the God of the gaps 
fallacy (or “spaceman of the gaps”) wherein any gap in knowledge is explained by 
reference to some paranormal cause, in this case aliens. As gaps in knowledge are 
par for the course in archaeology, this is a common trope in pseudoarchaeology. In 
this case, we don’t know how the Great Pyramid was made (ignorance), there are 
no specific records of their construction (gaps), and it’s inconceivable the primitive 
Egyptians could have done so (incredulity), therefore, they must have had alien 
help. Weeks (1973:78) also notes a common use of the “sweeping generalization” 
fallacy, where a complex and nuanced issue is characterized with an implausibly 
broad gloss. For example, he states all the cuneiform tablets from the Sumerian 
city of Ur are references to gods (i.e., aliens), which is false.
While these arguments may seem plausible to a lay audience, they are incredibly 
frustrating for experts. Even if every point raised was accurate, that does not 
argue in favor of alien intervention. “We don’t know” means only that, that “we 
don’t know”. It is not an invitation to insert any explanation one wishes. We 
have already established that extraterrestrial visitations to Earth are profoundly

implausible. And to argue that one’s own incredulity that the local Egyptians could 
have constructed the monuments unaided tells one more about you than the 
Egyptians. This reeks of ethnocentrism and racism.
But more to the point, every element in the argument is false. We have iden­
tified substantial quarries used in construction of the Giza Necropolis, including 
the Great Pyramid. Most of these quarries are easily identified today due to the 
amount of material removed from them. Geophysical techniques allow us to iden­
tify from which quarry a given block was removed. Most of these quarries are 
nearby the Nile, and even while individual rocks were huge, it is a straightfor­
ward matter of engineering to transport them on wooden rollers to the river, 
onto barges, and then to the construction sites. We have recovered countless tools 
used to split and dress the rocks. And we have uncovered the remains of cities of 
workers and of construction ramps. All the supposed gaps in our knowledge that 
von Däniken cites as evidence for alien involvement have long since been filled.
What von Däniken fails to appreciate, or decides to ignore, is that manpower 
and time can compensate for technology. He grossly overestimates the time needed 
to construct the Great Pyramid at over 600 years (30 years is a more reasonable 
estimate), overestimating the mass of the monument and the available labor force 
(Baker 1973:65). One engineer estimated that 20 men using only ropes (which 
von Däniken falsely claims didn’t exist in Egypt) could have moved one of the 
pyramid stones (Houlsby 1973:84). The kings of Egypt could mobilize levies of 
thousands of workers, willing to work on one project for decades. They could 
do this because of the power of the religious ideology underlying their political 
power. In much the same way medieval Church authorities in Europe could use 
“primitive” technology with armies of workers, inspired by eternal salvation, in 
the construction of a cathedral that wouldn’t be completed until those who started 
construction were long dead. But von Däniken would never invoke such an argu­
ment, as apparently Europeans never needed alien assistance.
Michael Shermer (2013:92), summarizes the argument against alien involve­
ment in the construction of any Egyptian monument, the pyramids in particular:
…archaeologists have discovered images demonstrating how tens of 
thousands of Egyptian workers employed wood sleds to move the stones 
along roads from the quarry to the site and then hauled them up gently 
sloping dirt ramps of an ever growing pyramid. Copper drills, chisels, saws 
and awls have been found in the rubble around the Great Pyramid of Giza, 
and the quarries are filled with half-​finished blocks and broken tools that 
show how the Egyptians worked the stone. Conspicuously absent from the 
archaeological record are any artifacts more advanced than those known to 
be used in the third millennium B.C.
Another line of supposed evidence in favor of a mysterious origin of the pyramids 
is the “fact” that pyramids suddenly appeared in several other ancient cultures,

such as the Maya. Rather than misinterpreting evidence, this argument is simply 
not true. While it is true that many ancient cultures built pyramidal structures, this 
is because, without a metal skeleton, tall stone buildings need a very wide base or 
they collapse. At least one Egyptian pyramid did just that, we’ve found the rubble. 
Which is surprising given the argument that pyramids appear out of nowhere…in 
fact we see a long history of pyramid building wherever they appear, with earlier, 
smaller forms gradually leading to larger structures, with missteps along the way. 
Exactly what one would expect from clever humans developing a new technology 
from indigenous materials.
Von Däniken is apparently the source for a popular belief regarding the height 
of the Great Pyramid. Supposedly, multiplying the height (in feet) times one 
billion yields a figure in miles that is close to the distance from the Earth to the 
Sun. Surely this astonishing coincidence could only be explained if the Egyptians 
had at their disposal sources of information from beyond this world? Not so quick. 
First, calculating the distance from the Earth to Sun is a relatively simple geo­
metric problem and would have been within the Egyptian mathematical abilities, 
though there is no evidence that they did so. Second, the figure one arrives at is 
approximately 91,000,000 miles, when in fact the average distance to the sun is 
93,000,000 miles, a nearly 4% error. Not much perhaps but one expects better 
from our alien mentors.
Mathematical curiosities in the Great Pyramid apparently abound. Allegedly 
the area of the base multiplied by twice the height gives the value of pi (Jordan 
2006:120). This is absurd for a few reasons. First, it is impossible to get a truly 
irrational number such as Pi by dividing two discrete numbers such as the height 
or area of a polygon. The original exponent of this idea, John Taylor, in 1864, used 
a unit termed a “pyramid inch” which was arrived at by dividing the perimeter of 
the pyramid by 366 (days in a year rounded up). Why twice the height? Why not 
three times? Why round up to 366 and not down to 365? These are all arbitrary 
manipulations, essentially numerology, with no real meaning or relevance. Even if 
the value was close to Pi, all this would indicate is a geometric oddity, or math­
ematically adept architects.
Von Däniken and others have also made much of the precision with which 
the pyramid was constructed. The sides of the structure’s base, for example, match 
almost exactly the cardinal directions, deviating from true north by 1/​15th of one 
degree (Stiebling 1984:117). Such precision would simply have been beyond the 
primitive technology of Bronze Age Egypt, so the reasoning goes, and thus they 
must have had extraterrestrial assistance. This is another example of an argument 
from incredulity; just because von Däniken can’t imagine the Egyptians were cap­
able of such precision doesn’t mean they were not. In fact, the necessary precision 
is relatively simple. One would need to establish a flat construction base. Next, one 
needs to find true north, which is achievable by bisecting the angle formed by 
the rising and setting of any star in the northern sky and an earthbound reference 
point. Moving multi-​ton blocks into place would have been a massive undertaking

involving an army of workers. But the technical requirements would have been 
well within the capabilities of the time.
An alternative strategy used by von Däniken is to draw attention to an ancient 
work of art, the subject of which is not immediately apparent, and argue that it is a 
depiction of extraterrestrial technology, or an extraterrestrial being. This draws on 
the fact that artistic representations are rooted in the cultural and historical context 
of the society that produced them. Art involves often cryptic symbols, but which 
make sense within the artist’s culture. Von Däniken ignores the symbolic quality of 
art and assumes all prehistoric art is a direct representation. By removing art from 
its cultural and historical context, and ignoring symbolic content, von Däniken 
can portray any artistic motif not immediately identifiable as an anomaly requiring 
explanation, and the explanation is always aliens. Feder (2018:195) refers to this as 
the “inkblot hypothesis” in that the ambiguity of the images allows an uncritical 
viewer to map on any meaning that suits them: “when you are unfamiliar with 
the culture you can make just about anything you want to out of these images”.
There are numerous examples of this misrepresentation of ancient artworks 
as evidence of alien contact, but the most cited is a carved sarcophagus lid from 
the Maya site of Palenque. The Classic Maya were a collection of city states on 
the Yucatan Peninsula of Central America, which thrived between approximately 
200 and 800 c.e. Palenque was not the largest or strongest Maya state, but features 
some of the culture’s most elaborate architecture, most of it associated with roy­
alty. The greatest figure from Palenque was Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal, though he is 
common referred to Pacal the Great, or simply Pacal. Pacal’s reign at Palenque 
stretched over six decades through the seventh century. He is among the best 
documented figures of the Pre-​Columbian Americas.
After his death in 683 c.e. Pacal was laid to rest under a large pyramidal struc­
ture termed the Temple of the Inscriptions (there is some debate as to whether 
the skeleton recovered from the site was in fact Pacal’s). Regardless of who is 
buried under the temple, von Däniken and other ancient astronaut proponents 
have focused on the iconography decorating the lid of the sarcophagus containing 
the skeleton (Figure 7.2). The lid is carved with a semi-​reclined human with elab­
orate glyphs and decorations radiating downward below and above. Von Däniken 
presented the figure with a simple formal analogy, arguing that the posture of 
the figure (Pacal himself) is similar to that of an astronaut in a space capsule. The 
decorative motifs below the figure are said to be a rocket and rocket exhaust, and 
those above supposedly represent a control panel. In an interview von Däniken 
touted the Pacal sarcophagus as the best available evidence of alien technology in 
the ancient world (Colavito 2012b).
Von Däniken’s protégé Giorgio Tsoukalos, on the popular program Ancient 
Aliens (see below), described the image of Pacal as follows:
He is at an angle like modern-​day astronauts upon liftoff. He is manipu­
lating some controls. He has some type of breathing apparatus or some type

of a telescope in front of his face. His feet are on some type of a pedal. And 
you have something that looks like an exhaust-​with flames.
Had von Däniken consulted experts in Maya art, they would have explained the 
image in question is hardly an anomaly, and that no extraterrestrial explanation 
is needed. Pacal’s sarcophagus imagery is consistent with what is known of Maya 
religion and cosmology. Rather than an astronaut, the image depicts Pacal’s descent 
into the Maya underworld, or Xibalba, and the Cieba Tree of Life that connects 
the upper, lower, and Earthly worlds of the Maya cosmos, with the Maya Earth 
Monster waiting below. Von Däniken ignores all this, taking a single image out of 
context and falsely portraying it as mysterious, and an extraterrestrial explanation 
as most plausible (Mosley 2000).
Von Däniken’s choice of the Maya to treat in such a cavalier fashion is mysti­
fying. It is an unfortunate fact that most prehistoric art is mysterious as to its cul­
tural context and deeper meanings. Art is by definition a symbolic abstraction and 
is always deeply affected by the culture of the artist and the historical context in 
which it is created. It is, therefore, not uncommon to see motifs in ancient art that 
are not easily identified. Many of these seem to depict objects or figures that are 
floating or flying, or to depict figures that are clearly not human, or not entirely 
human. To say, however, that because we don’t know what these images represent, 
they must represent aliens, is to commit once again an argument from ignorance 
fallacy. One is essentially saying “you can’t prove they aren’t aliens, so they must 
be aliens”. As discussed in the beginning of this chapter, the physical challenges of 
interplanetary travel mean almost any explanation besides aliens would be a more 
plausible explanation. It’s far more likely that sometimes humans just draw weird 
stuff that’s hard to figure out.
But with Pacal’s tomb, none of this applies. The Maya didn’t disappear, 
there were millions of them at the time of contact with Spain, and millions of 
them live in Central America today. They were the descendants of centuries of 
Mesoamerican culture stretching back centuries prior to Palenque, context which 
is of course ignored (Colavito 2012c). The Spanish recorded Maya religion and 
myths. Archaeologists and epigraphers translated their glyphic language, and we’ve 
read countless Mayan inscriptions. Millions of people can look at Pacal’s inscrip­
tion, and to them its meaning is no more opaque than the ceiling of the Sistine 
Chapel would be to a practicing Catholic. There are countless people alive today 
who can look at the image and tell you exactly what it means. They just happen 
to speak Mayan languages and live in Central America. To claim this image is 
an alien is not just an example of faulty logic, it is an insulting lack of regard for 
Native American culture. Feder (2018:197) aptly summarizes von Däniken’s mis­
representation of Pacal:
Pacal’s story needs no tired speculation about extraterrestrial visitations 
to the earth. Pacal was a dynamic and vibrant historical personage, a real

human being who lived, ruled a great city, and died more than 1,300 years 
ago, and whose story has been revealed by archaeology and history.
With the example of the Nazca Lines, von Däniken essentially combines his two 
approaches, making an argument of both technical implausibility, as well as of 
extraterrestrial depiction. And again, he ignores archaeological knowledge and cul­
tural context to push the alien hypothesis. The Nazca Lines are massive geoglyphs 
made between 2,500 and 1,500 years ago, etched into the desert floor of coastal 
Peru. Geoglyphs are not particularly rare, and occur in many parts of the world, 
but Nazca is the best-​known example. Despite their considerable size (the largest 
is over a kilometer across), their construction is relatively simple, consisting of 
scraping the darker weathered surface away to reveal paler sediments. The figures 
are mostly simple lines and geometric figures, but there are also dozens of animal 
figurines, a monkey and a hummingbird being the most famous examples, but a 
wide range of fauna being represented in total. One humanoid figure (Figure 7.3) 
is described as an astronaut but has more plausibly been interpreted as a fisherman 
(Colavito 2013b).
Von Däniken takes the Nazca Lines and makes the argument of technical 
incompetence. The local ancient Peruvians would not have been capable of such 
precise constructions, and since one can only discern them from above, they must 
have been created for the eyes of someone or something that could fly. The only 
explanation that makes sense, he argues, is that the linear patterns were constructed 
as landing strips for alien flying machines. One pattern he argues matches the 
taxiways and hangers of a modern airport. Not content with demeaning the tech­
nical competence of the Nazca people, he argues that some of the depictions are 
depictions of aliens.
These allegations have all the same validity as those made for the Egyptian 
pyramids, which is to say none. Creating the lines is as easy as sweeping aside a 
layer of gravel, and planning the patterns is as mathematically simple as laying out 
a pyramid. With horizon markers, a means of measurement, and sufficient man­
power and motivation, the lines’ construction would not have been a significant 
challenge for the Nazca. One researcher notes:
The large designs wouldn’t have required balloons or extraterrestrial 
assistance. Scientists over the years have come to the conclusion that a 
combination of tall posts, upright stones driven into the ground at regular 
intervals, string, and stakes were probably used to plot rough lines across the 
desert.

In one experiment a comparably sized geoglyph was created in a single day 
(Nickell 1983). While it is true that they are best seen from the air, they are also 
visible from raised platforms, archaeological evidence of which has been recovered

(Curry 2007). Also, the linear glyphs stretch for miles in many directions, not the 
relatively short and organized pattern one sees in an airport (Whittaker 1973:59). 
The surface of the lines, after the overlying stones have been swept away, is soft 
and uneven sand, not suitable for wheeled vehicles let alone aircraft (Houlsby 
1973:86). And even if they were constructed far from any vantage, this is not 
evidence of air vehicles, only a belief in a sky-​dwelling viewer. Many medieval 
churches and cathedrals were built in the shape of a cross, but no one has argued 
this was for alien viewers.

Then there is the content of the Nazca art. While it is true that we know far 
less about the meaning of the motifs rendered in the Nazca Lines than for the 
Maya case, the Nazca having been nonliterate and never directly observed by 
literate peoples, that does not mean one can offer any explanation one pleases. 
That would be the umpteenth example of an argument from ignorance. And 
while we don’t know much about the Nazca specifically, we do know a lot about 
Native American symbolism and the symbolism used by traditional societies. The 
representations in the Nazca art are almost all animals, and typically animals with 
sacred associations in Native American cultures. The one human figure is far more 
likely a deity, spirit, or a Native shaman, than a spacesuit wearing astronaut. It’s 
perhaps beside the point to note that any real alien would not likely have a human 
form, low-​budget science fiction aliens notwithstanding
Early explanations of the lines argued that they may have been horizon markers 
for observations of heavenly bodies. More recently, archaeologists who have 
studied the ancient cultures of South America have interpreted the Nazca Lines in 
a cultural context of a sacred landscape. The representations of animals and abstract 
figures relate to both water and fertility, which is plausible given the local aridity 
and the horticultural base of the society (Reinhard 1988). Ceremonies conducted 
at the glyphs could have involved ritual participants walking along the lines, which 
would have been visible “from far and wide” by participants on other glyphs 
(Curry 2007). There is archaeological evidence of ritual feasting and animal sacri­
fice nearby the lines. The figures do not need an external explanation, they make 
sense in the cultural and historical context in which they were created. Even if we 
don’t know and may never know the details of their meaning, this is a vastly more 
plausible argument than anything proffered by von Däniken.
Von Däniken also misrepresents the size of some figures, particularly one that is 
described as aircraft parking. This geoglyph is actually the foot of a bird figure, but 
it is quite small, only a few feet across. This was pointed out during a 1978 public 
broadcasting documentary, and while von Däniken did admit this error, it was 
not corrected in later editions of Chariots. This implies he doesn’t believe his own 
arguments enough to even be consistent with basic measurements. Von Däniken 
is somewhat unusual in that he does occasionally make claims about specific data, 
claims which are easily debunked. But he likely also realizes readers will remember 
the claim itself, not its disproval, so there is little need to revise his claims when 
confronted.
But all this is secondary to the sheer implausibility of the argument. It may 
feel economical and simple, a single explanation for all prehistoric complexity. 
Flemming (2006:65) notes people naturally gravitate to arguments that focus 
on a single agent to explain something. Similar to the case of the Aquatic Ape 
hypothesis, the seemingly simple “umbrella argument” of ancient aliens conceals 
unsupported assumptions, violating Occam’s Razor. If von Däniken’s arguments 
regarding the Nazca Lines are to be believed, we must imagine intelligent beings 
with the godlike technology to cross vast interstellar distances yet are somehow

dependent on people using stone tools to build their landing facilities. In this 
case von Däniken benefits from the fact that the Nazca culture is poorly known 
in comparison to many other prehistoric peoples; it makes it easy to argue from 
ignorance: we don’t know exactly how or why they made the lines, so there must 
have been an alien actor involved (see Shermer 2013).
Feder (2018:192) again summarizes the implausibility of von Däniken’s 
argument:
We have to assume the existence of extraterrestrial, intelligent life (unproven); 
assume that they visited Earth in the distant past (unproven and not very 
likely); assume that they needed to build rather strange airfields (pretty hard 
to swallow); and then, for added amusement, instructed local Indians to con­
struct enormous representations of birds, spiders, monkeys, fish and snakes.
When the required assumptions are laid out, as opposed to the alternative, that 
Native Americans were clever, we can easily see how flimsy and irrational the 
argument is.
These three cases, the Great Pyramid, Pacal’s sarcophagus, and the Nazca Lines, 
are but three examples of many singled out as alleged evidence of past alien inter­
ference. An exhaustive list of all alleged alien interventions in the ancient world 
would be beyond the scope of this volume, but essentially any ancient technology, 
depiction, or even descriptions that could be misrepresented as an anomaly 
requiring an alien explanation, has probably been so misinterpreted. Non-​Western 
cultures preferred of course.
Moshenka (2017:128) illustrates a rhetorical device used by von Däniken and 
other pseudoscientists. While his goal is clearly to claim extraterrestrial visitations, 
he is generally careful to not positively aver such to have been the case. Instead, 
he phrases his assertions as questions. “Is it not possible that” or “could this be evi­
dence that” phrasing abounds. This approach allows von Däniken to seem more 
reasonable than he actually is. He’s not claiming anything, he can say, he’s “just 
asking questions”. The “just asking questions” gambit allows a claimant to enter 
a ludicrous claim into the discourse but provides a ready retreat if said claim is 
questioned or refuted.
Having undercut the underlying logic and the factual basis of von Däniken’s 
claims, we might ask the “why” question. What was his motivation in starting 
the ancient astronaut phenomenon in the first place? As to the broad question of 
credibility and motivations, I will refer back to von Däniken’s fraud convictions; 
not to resort to an ad hominem, but this does little to enhance his credibility, 
and presents the likelihood that he has never really believed what he’s selling. It’s 
impossible to know if this is the case, and ultimately it doesn’t matter. Just as in the 
case of cult leaders, von Däniken’s “phenomenon” has been characterized as an 
“archaeological cult par excellence” (Cole 1980:10), motivations matter little in 
comparison to the effect their “teachings” have on their followers. In this regard 
 

128  Pseudoarchaeology and Ancient Aliens
128
128
Von Däniken’s writings are often responded to by true believers much in the same 
way as cultists respond to dogma, taken as true based on faith rather than being 
supported by any evidence.
In a 1974 interview (Ferris 1974), von Däniken makes a statement that gives 
away his manipulation of facts to suit his agenda: “It’s true that I accept what I like 
and reject what I don’t like … everyone accepts just what he needs for his theory”. 
He is of course describing the common cognitive bias of cherry-​picking, and he 
goes on to justify it as something “every theologian” does. The interviewer points 
out that von Däniken is ostensibly claiming to conduct science, not theology, and 
science requires one to do everything possible to avoid such cognitive biases. To 
claim that other writers, in theology or any other field, selectively accept only 
those data that support their ideas, as justification for one doing the same, is itself 
a logical fallacy: the tu quoque fallacy, claiming that the logical errors of others 
excuse one’s own.
One might question why one should spend time debunking the tired canards 
of von Däniken. Von Däniken’s popularity has waned in recent years, especially 
in the United States. He has more name recognition in Europe; between 2003 
and 2006 he even operated an extraterrestrial themed amusement park in his 
native Switzerland. Few current American undergraduate students have heard of 
him. But the ideas he popularized have not gone away and are infecting a new 
population. Pseudoscience rarely disappears once confronted. At best it might 
lay low for a time and—​reemerge. Such has been the case with ancient aliens. 
Von Däniken’s brand of pseudoscience has persisted and is seen in contemporary 
figures.
Studies of belief in a range of pseudoscientific concepts (e.g., Bainbridge 1978; 
Feder 1984 2006) have identified low levels of strong belief in such ideas, and that 
strong belief has gone down over time. This may seem reassuring, however, the 
same studies also identified low levels of strong disbelief as well, with most not 
having a strong opinion one way or another. Most alarming is that these figures 
don’t change much if students have been exposed to relevant scientific courses, in 
archaeology for example. And a more recent survey (Chapman University 2018) 
estimates that a shocking 41% of American adults believe in the ancient aliens 
hypothesis. Furthermore, this figure was significantly higher than when measured 
a few years prior (Schiele 2020:4), indicating that the belief in question is not only 
prevalent but increasing in frequency.
This indicates the presence of a large, growing, and intellectually vulnerable 
population that has not been prepared to evaluate irrational claims. We teach 
students what we believe to be true, but don’t teach them how to move beyond 
these facts to evaluate the truth value of specific claims. Nor do we often want 
to lower ourselves to discuss the nonsense claims that mark the world of pseudo­
science. This is akin to an infectious disease expert explaining known pathogens, 
but not teaching about how new pathogens can be identified or basic preventative 
measures.

While von Däniken’s name is still most closely related to ancient astronauts, 
there have been other prominent proponents. One such figure was the bib­
lical scholar Zecharia Sitchin. Sitchin wrote extensively of ancient Hebrew and 
Sumerian sources in Israel and later in the United States prior to his death in 
2010. Sitchen’s argument was that the Earth was colonized by aliens from a planet 
within our solar system hundreds of thousands of years ago. These beings interbred 
with Homo erectus, creating our species. Ancestral memories of these events are 
recorded in biblical sources. For example, references to Nephilim are references to 
these aliens, later mistranslated as “giants” (Wojciehowski 1997). Sitchen is often 
cited by ancient alien proponents since he did have professional standing as an 
expert in ancient languages.
Sitchen’s hypotheses can be dismissed on several issues of plausibility. We have 
already discussed the sheer impossibility of interbreeding between aliens and 
ancient hominins. In addition, Sitchen’s purported “planet 12” (the moon and 
sun counting as 10 and 11 apparently) would have to be located well beyond the 
orbits of Neptune and Pluto in our solar system. And while there are numerous 
bodies orbiting that far out from the sun, possibly even a sizeable one, the odds 
of one sustaining complex life so far from the sun are essentially zero. Giving 
any credibility to Sitchen is an argument from authority, where his authority as 
a linguistic scholar is irrelevant next to his obvious ignorance of planetology and 
astrobiology.
By the start of the twenty-​first century, it seemed as if the ancient aliens idea 
might be on its way out. Leading proponents, such as Pye or Sitchen, had died. 
von Däniken himself was of advancing years, though his books still sold well. But, 
as skeptics all realize, no bad idea is ever gone forever, as pseudoscience is resistant 
to refutation. So it was with little surprise that another figure seized the oppor­
tunity to profit from the ancient astronaut hypothesis: Giorgio Tsoukalos. Swiss-​
born though of Greek ancestry, Tsoukalos has a BA in communications and has 
worked TV production and as a promoter for bodybuilding events. He ascended 
to popular relevance in 2009 with the premier of the History Channel program 
Ancient Aliens, which has since aired over 100 episodes, with Tsoukalos as the lead 
presenter.
Since it first aired, Ancient Aliens has become one of the most popular offerings 
on the History Channel with viewership often topping a million viewers per 
showing (Holly 2015:615). At the height of its popularity it was the fourth watched 
program among adult men, something no science program has come close to 
achieving (Schiele 2020:3). Tsoukalos himself has become a widely recognized 
pop culture icon. Ancient Aliens has even given new life to von Däniken’s popu­
larity, as he often features as a commentator on the program, appearing in 60 
episodes between 2009 and 2017.
The program has covered a wide variety of topics over its run, but the modus 
operandi is the same: take some seeming anomaly in prehistory, ignore any 
explanatory context, ascribe it to aliens, and write off any human contribution as

implausible due to their primitive nature. Prehistoric cultures used nothing more 
sophisticated than “dental floss and chicken bones”. As with von Däniken, it’s the 
same play: cherry pick the data, ignore the context, embrace the argument from 
incredulity with all the implicit racism, and throw Occam’s Razor out the window.
Tsoukalos and his shows are notable not for any innovative content, but for 
their implications regarding the current popularity of the ancient aliens concept. 
The undeniable popularity of the program, due in part to Tsoukalos’s popular 
appeal, shows the seductive nature of pseudoscience, and outlines a failure by the 
scientific community to engage the public. For detailed critiques of the program, 
the reader is recommended to view White’s Ancient Aliens Debunked (2012) video 
as well as relevant episodes of Dunning’s Skeptoid podcast (e.g., episodes 4719–​
4721 at skeptoid.com).
While the program’s pseudoscientific offerings are too extensive to rebut in 
their entirety, it is worthwhile to offer a selection of topics Ancient Aliens covered, 
and how they misrepresent reality. One example is drawn from biblical scripture. 
The Book of Ezekiel describes an object the show interprets as a representation 
of a flying machine. The angels are said in the King James Bible to have “the 
likeness of a man” (Eze. 1:5) albeit with wings and multiple faces, some of specific 
animals. Much is made of such verses as “And when the living creatures went, 
the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the 
earth, the wheels were lifted up” (Eze. 1:19) as evidence of flying vehicles, but the 
passage goes on to describe a throne “and upon the likeness of the throne was 
the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it” (Eze. 1:26) and “This was 
the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD (Eze. 1:27).
In short, the quote is taken out of context, and actually refers to angels 
bearing a divine throne through the sky. The angels, or cherubim, appear in forms 
established in descriptions of the arc of the covenant and the first temple. The fact 
that they are described as having the faces of Earthly animals such as an eagle is 
conveniently ignored (Colavito 2012b). The rings described in the passage are the 
rings or wheels used to transport the arc of the covenant (Sweeney 1998). Cole 
(1973:110) notes that in von Däniken’s original treatment of Ezekiel all the focus 
is on the wheels, lending some credence to an interpretation of an alien wheeled 
vehicle, while the throne is discounted, which is cherry-​picking only the bits of 
the vision that fit one interpretation and ignoring the bits that don’t. Cole notes 
(1973:112) that Ezekiel is not alone when he had allegedly saw the vehicle…he is 
in fact in a crowd of refugees, none of whom apparently saw anything. This makes 
sense if it were a subjective vision on the part of Ezekiel (who was established as 
having visions elsewhere in the Bible) but makes no sense if there was a physical 
aircraft present.
It is worth noting that the occupant of the throne commands Ezekiel to “Get 
the unto the house of Israel and speak with my words unto them” (Eze. 3:4), as 
the Israelites were not at this point in the Old Testament measuring up to God’s 
expectations. This would be a curious mission for a spaceship-​piloting alien to

give a Bronze Age human but makes sense within the context of biblical narrative. 
The Book of Ezekiel is a story of a prophet who experiences visions that transmit 
prophecies regarding the state and future of the Jewish people. The small piece that 
Ancient Aliens excerpts is known to biblical scholars as the “Throne Vision” and 
is generally interpreted as the Prophet experiencing a vision of God among the 
heavenly host and has never been interpreted as a description of a physical experi­
ence. In short, Ancient Aliens follows an old playbook, taking a piece of a complex 
phenomenon that might seem at first glance to be an anomaly, forcing it into the 
predetermined paranormal narrative, and ignoring the broader context.
Another episode refers to a cavern beneath the Great Sphinx of Ancient Egypt 
that supposedly contains records left by Atlantis. Allegedly the Sphinx is the same age 
as Plato’s description of Atlantis, and that is all the evidence offered. Feder (2018:161–​
186) offers a detailed refutation of the various allegations of antediluvian civilizations, 
so I will only summarize. Plato was not writing a literal history but invoked the idea 
of Atlantis as an allegorical foil to extol the virtues of Athens. While the exact date of 
the Sphinx’s construction is not known, it was made to represent the Pharaoh Khafre 
approximately 4,500 years ago, thousands of years after Plato’s Atlantis would have 
existed, which it didn’t because he made it up. The same could be said for the so-​
called Hall of Records that was invented by noted occultist Edgar Cayce in the early 
twentieth-​century, and also sited below the Sphinx (Stille 1997:56). Finally, there is 
the matter of a complete lack of evidence for caverns beneath or nearby the monu­
ment despite abundant investigations of the area. The Great Sphinx is no stranger to 
pseudoscientific controversy and has repeatedly been attributed implausible age along 
the same lines as proposed by Cayce (e.g., Schoch 1992).
Ancient Aliens has numerous examples of the misinterpretation of ancient 
artworks. Pacal’s tomb and the Nazca Lines feature prominently in episodes, des­
pite being readily explainable within their respective cultural context and any alien 
interpretation long since debunked. Late prehistoric South American figurines, 
believed to be stylized depictions of animals such as fish or birds, are presented by 
Ancient Aliens as images of airplanes. Native American iconography in general is 
known for depictions of stylized and abstracted versions of animals, which provided 
much of the symbolic grammar for Native myth and religion. Birds, lizards, and 
amphibians are common in Native iconography, in part because they occupy a lim­
inal state in Native cosmology, inhabiting numerous realms of existence (sky, land, 
water). The South American figures are in no way out of the ordinary for Native 
American art, but this broader context is ignored in pursuit of a specific fallacious 
argument. As one Egyptologist stated soon after Chariot’s first publication:
Many of the big questions presented by Von Däniken as defying the answer 
acceptable to an “intelligent” modern [person] are seen to lose their force 
once the full array of known historical facts have been set down and assessed 
objectively.
Baker 1973:74

While it is challenging to identify a “worst example” from the Ancient Aliens 
oeuvre, my vote would be the program’s association of the infamous Crystal Skulls 
with aliens. Dunning (2020) covers these in brief, and in detail (2008). Carved 
human skulls of glass crystal have long been a focus of pseudoscientific belief, with 
many unscientific interpretations, so here I will confine discussion to the Ancient 
Aliens treatment. There the objects are explained as ancient alien records, which 
will supposedly instigate a significant event if gathered. Much is made of the fact 
that there are 13 of these objects known, a significant number in many cultures. 
The popularity of the significance of crystal skulls for supposed alien visitations 
was likely further popularized by the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the 
Crystal Skull, where crystal skulls (albeit of vaguely alien, though still humanoid, 
shape) play a major role in an alien-​centered plot.
In the end, the 13 crystal skulls are another example of anomaly hunting. It is 
true that with no further information, 13 human skulls of clear crystal are an odd 
occurrence, calling for explanation. What Ancient Aliens ignores is that we have 
long had that explanation, no aliens needed. The skulls were most likely carved 
(by humans) in the late nineteenth century in the German gem-​making center 
of Idar-​Oberstein. While the provenance and chain of ownership varies from spe­
cimen to specimen, it is clear that they are of recent manufacture and traded as 
objets d’art. This information has been available for decades, and even a cursory 
attempt to research the objects would have uncovered it. But that would get in 
the way of the Ancient Aliens modus operandi: find something seemingly old and 
unusual, ignore anything already known about it, and put it forward as evidence 
for alien contact, which is assumed a priori to have occurred.
All this leads us to the perennial question: what’s the harm in believing in 
ancient astronauts? The sheer popularity of the concept makes it a threat to public 
science literacy. Since a democracy’s function is a product of an informed public, 
this is no inconsiderable concern. However, we can point to some more specific 
concerns as well.
The ancient aliens hypothesis has directly contributed to damage to the arch­
aeological record. In 2013, two German nationals were granted access to areas of 
the Great Pyramid at Giza that are not typically open to the public. While there, 
they chiseled samples from the rock and smuggled the fragments back to Germany 
for unspecified analysis. They released video of their exploits on the internet and 
were met with universal condemnation by Egyptian antiquities authorities, the 
Egyptian government, and the archaeological community. While they did return 
the fragments, the damage to the monument, while minor, was permanent. Their 
motivation was to prove that the pyramid was much older than the archaeo­
logical consensus would allow, and a remnant of an ancient Atlantean civilization. 
The Nazca Lines have also fallen victim to vandalism. The geoglyphs have been 
repeatedly damaged by interlopers and tourists, notably in 2014 as part of a pro­
motional stunt by the conservation organization Greenpeace. While neither of 
these cases were specifically the work of ancient alien proponents, the work of von 
 
 

Pseudoarchaeology and Ancient Aliens  133

133
Däniken, Tsouklos, and others who have questioned the scientific understanding 
of monuments of the ancient world contribute to the likelihood of such vandalism.
Pseudoarchaeological interpretations can also perversely discourage scien­
tific examination of the same ancient monuments. Professional archaeologists 
who don’t want to be associated with pseudoscience might distance them­
selves from studying the favored example of ancient alien proponents. And 
incidents of pseudoscience-fueled vandalism have led some governments to 
restrict access, even legitimate scientific access, to ancient monuments. The 
simultaneous popularization of such sites, along with the minimization of their 
cultural heritage, threatens their physical integrity and ultimately limits scien­
tific research (Curry 2007).
While the likelihood of direct damage to archaeological resources is serious, we 
also need to acknowledge the implicit racism underlying the ancient aliens con­
cept. Brian Dunning, of Skeptoid.com, aptly phrases this issue:
Ancient Aliens is, at its core, a slap in the face to the ingenuity of the human 
race. It charges that humans were not smart enough or industrious enough 
to build great works and great art, and therefore the explanation for the 
existence of these things must be alien intervention. But, even more than 
that, Ancient Aliens incisively focuses its attack on human populations of 
color. It’s always the brown people of Mesoamerica or the Indus Valley who 
needed alien help; never the white Greeks with their exquisite Parthenon….
Dunning 2020
Why did the supposed aliens only help dark-​skinned people? Feder (2018:206) 
notes that, of the 51 examples of supposedly alien influence in Chariots, only two 
are from Europe:
It is curious that Von Däniken never wonders who helped the ancient 
Minoans build the great palace at Knossos or the Greeks, the Parthenon, 
or which spacemen instructed the Romans in constructing the Colosseum. 
Why not? These monuments are every bit as impressive as those that Von 
Däniken does mention.
The answer to Feder’s question would seem to be that these European cultures 
have been placed in a narrative of the development of Western Civilization, and 
as such are seen as more advanced than non-​Western (read, non-​Caucasian) 
cultures. This implicit racism is accompanied by numerous statements that are 
explicitly racist in von Däniken’s writing, which I won’t dignify by repeating (but 
Feder provides a representative sample). Given the demonstrated popularity of 
the ancient aliens trope in today’s media, we should be very concerned that, aside 
from its many factual inaccuracies and faulty logic, it has become yet another way 
to insinuate ethnocentric and racist ideas into popular consciousness.

To conclude this discussion, while any one claim of the alien contact theory 
can be refuted, the entire idea can be questioned based on the parsimony principle 
discussed in previous chapters. The orthodox theories of human evolution and 
that of the origin of various ancient civilizations requires a minimum of plausible 
assumptions. Anatomically modern humans developed via the well-​established 
process of natural selection from ancestral hominins, of whom we have copious 
fossil evidence. The monumental architecture of ancient civilizations fits within 
what we already know of their cultures based on their writings and on archaeo­
logical remains and were the product of human labor and ingenuity. Full stop.
By contrast, the assumptions required to accept the alien contact theory are 
numerous and increasingly implausible. The most laughable assumption is that 
for the alien hypothesis to be true, archaeologists would have to be profoundly 
incompetent (we can’t all be that bad at our jobs), or knowingly suppressing “the 
truth”. There is always an element of conspiracy theory in such arguments, and 
grand conspiracy theories are inherently implausible. Simply too many people 
would have to be in on the big lie to keep it secret. Archaeology isn’t a huge 
industry, but there are several thousand of us worldwide. To assume that we’d all 
keep such a secret, with no overarching authority to enforce it, with fame and for­
tune awaiting the first leaker, is implausible to near impossibility.
That pragmatic fact aside, for the hypothesis to be true we must accept that 
intelligent aliens exist, admittedly not an implausible idea as we have already 
discussed. However, we must then accept that these aliens had the means and 
motives to come to our planet in the past, which is unlikely in the extreme. 
Evidence of life on Earth is very hard to detect even from our own space probes, 
let alone from a distant star. Interstellar travel on any sort of large scale is likely 
impossible due to the physical limits of velocity and the sheer distances involved. 
One could hypothesize alien mastery over some sort of unknown physics, but one 
might as well invoke magic. And should beings possessing such godlike technology 
arrive at our world, it is hard to imagine why they would have had any interest in 
beings as primitive to them as ants are to us.
And yes, while we do study ants, it is rarely to the ant’s advantage. Physicist 
Stephen Hawking has noted that when technologically advanced cultures meet 
more primitive cultures, it generally ends with the enslavement or extinction of 
the latter. The very fact that we are still here to debate the likelihood of past alien 
contact is perhaps the most compelling evidence that it never happened.

ARCHAEOLOGY AS THE 
HANDMAIDEN OF IDEOLOGY
The relationship between archaeology and political power was aptly illustrated 
by Bruce Trigger (1984). Trigger proposed a three-​way division, identifying 
nationalist, colonialist, and imperialist types of archaeology. Nationalist archae­
ology is archaeology in the service of the nation state and extols the past of that 
state to the point of misrepresentation. One particularly sees such distortion of 
archaeology in countries that are relatively young, or in new regimes consoli­
dating power. Colonialist archaeology occurs when one culture subjugates and 
colonizes another, then denigrates the past of the colonized group. This can go to 
extremes where the archaeological remains of the colonized group are determined 
to be those of an entirely other people, ideally one ancestral to the colonizers. 
Imperialist archaeology includes situations where dominant nation states occupy 
and colonize numerous other cultures, establishing extensive empires. In these 
cases, the material past of imperial colonies are viewed as the property of the 
empire, free for the taking and display in private or public collections.
I am revising Trigger’s classification and making a distinction between archae­
ology that emphasizes/​misrepresents the past in support of nationalist goals, 
and archaeology that denigrates the past of occupied, colonized, or subjugated 
peoples to justify their oppression. This combines the imperialist and colonialist 
archaeologies, whose distinction is primarily one of scale, into a single category of 
racist archaeology. We start our investigation with the use of archaeology as a tool 
of nationalism.
Arnold (2006b:160) notes:
The fact that the past, particularly the “deep” past based on archaeological evi­
dence, has been invoked and appropriated by so many nationalist movements 
and regimes testifies to its political significance as cultural capital.

Regrettably the early history of archaeology was highly nationalist in character. 
During the nineteenth century, archaeology largely focused on the home country 
of the investigator, and surrounding states as well. It was typical for this research 
to emphasize the importance of the archaeological remains of one’s own country 
and denigrate those of one’s neighbors. No individual exemplifies this trend more 
than Gustaf Kossinna.
Kossinna and Nationalist Archaeology in Germany
Kossinna, who lived from 1858 to 1931, was among the first professional 
archaeologists, holding the position of Professor of German Archaeology at the 
University of Berlin. The fact that the title focused on “German” archaeology 
was telling, as Kossinna would become synonymous with the academic side of 
German nationalism. Kossinna lived through two pivotal events in European his­
tory. First was the Franco-​Prussian war. The German kingdom of Prussia’s vic­
tory over France in 1871 led to the unification of the German states and the 
establishment of the German Empire. Kossinna thus came of age when the con­
cept of a German nation was quite new, and when German national character 
was just developing. Nationalism as a concept is particularly prominent in newly 
established polities, and this surely had a profound influence on the nationalistic 
character of Kossinna’s research.
The second event was Germany’s defeat at the end of World War I in 1918. 
The national trauma of this cannot be overstated and led to an ideology of a “stab 
in the back” wherein Germany and German soldiers were not culpable for their 
defeat. Germany was a great nation, the narrative went, that was brought down 
by traitorous elements from within, specifically Jewish Germans and German 
communists. While Kossinna did not serve in the war, and already had led a signifi­
cant career by the war’s end, German defeat and the ensuing economic and social 
disruptions created a huge market for nationalistic ideals of the sort Kossinna 
provided (Arnold 1990:465).
Kossinna is associated with two concepts that is still central to archaeology. The 
first of these is the settlement pattern, or settlement archaeology. At a time when 
most archaeologists were focused on deep stratigraphic sequences at single sites, so 
as to develop sequences of archaeological cultures, Kossinna argued archaeologists 
should also focus on the distribution of sites on the landscape. Settlement archae­
ology seeks to understand the numerous factors that decide what types and ages of 
sites are associated with what parts of the landscape, and what the relationship of 
those sites are to one another. This is still vital to the modern archaeologist, even 
if the tools are satellite photos and Geographic Information Systems, rather than 
hand-​drawn maps.
Kossinna’s second key proposition has weathered the test of time less success­
fully, the idea of the “culture area” or Kulturkreis. Kossinna argued that artifact 
types repeatedly found in association with one another, what we would today call 
 
 

Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology  137
136
137
an “archaeological culture”, reflected real prehistoric cultures. By analyzing the 
distribution of these on the landscape an archaeologist could delineate ancient 
ethnic boundaries. We now know that ethnicity is very complex, variable across 
time and space, and often does not map simply on to patterns in material culture. 
Even so, modern archaeologists still use language that describes archaeological 
patterns related to past peoples, even if we do so more as a shorthand than in the 
literal sense.
Where Kossinna’s work became problematic, grading into pseudoscience, 
was when he combined these concepts with German nationalism. Kossinna had 
dedicated his career to finding of evidence of “Early Germans”. Originally a phil­
ologist focused on the structure and history of the German language, he shifted 
his efforts to archaeology to directly identify the past of German culture (Brather 
2008:320). Blather (2008:324) summarizes Kossinna’s approach:
The Kossinna “method” was centered on the prehistory of people, especially 
of the Germanic peoples or tribes…Influences from north to south were 
interpreted as the reflection of Germanic expansion…while in the opposite 
direction similarities were seen as only superficial imitations. Founded on 
this “successful” and “victorious” paradigm, Kossinna publicly fought for 
an “appropriate” appreciation of the “East German” or “own” prehistory 
… Everything beyond the “ancient Germans” and their Indo-​European 
“forefathers” since the Neolithic) was irrelevant in Kossinna’s eyes; even the 
Slavs as the “primitive” counterpart are mentioned vary rarely in his articles.
Kossinna believed Germany, particularly Northern/Eastern Germany, or Prussia, 
the land of his birth and the militaristic core of the early German state, was the 
ancient source of all civilized traits in Europe. Classical civilizations such as Greece 
and the Romans, and even the Hittites, were the result of “Nordic” coloniza­
tion from the north (Fehr 2018:38). “Germanic” traits could be traced over time 
diffusing southwards into Europe, but one did not see non-​German traits diffusing 
northwards into German territory. And hardly worthy of mention were the bar­
barous Slavic peoples to the east whom Kossinna saw as primitive, barely able to 
emulate merest shreds of Germanic culture. In this, Kossinna goes beyond “mere” 
nationalism to the realm of abject racism.
Of particular significance for the later use of Kossinna’s ideas is the fact that 
“Old Germany” as defined by the archaeological distribution of supposedly 
“Germanic” material traits was significantly more geographically expansive than 
the Germany of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, extending 
south and east of then current borders. A map representing the original and 
expanded extent of Old Germany (Kossinna 1927, Fig. 52) shows the extent of 
German culture reaching east into Poland, south as far as the Czech Republic, 
and north into Denmark and Sweden (Figure 8.1). Some early twentieth-​century 
German scholars would extend Germanic ancestry to Belgium and Northern

France (Fehr 2018:37). This geographic expanse of “German” ethnicity would 
become a particularly attractive concept following territorial concessions 
Germany was forced to make following World War I. Kossinna even attempted 
to protect Germany from territorial concessions after the war by sending his 
archaeological interpretations of ancient German expanse to the Versailles peace 
conference in 1919 (Arnold 1990:467).
It is also important to note that while Kossinna was one of the first thinkers 
we could consider archaeologists, he was not a modern archaeologist in sev­
eral fundamental ways, even when one allows for his nationalistic and racist 
ideology. He worked almost exclusively from museum or private collections 
and conducted only one excavation in his career. One effect of this is he never 
saw artifacts in any sort of systemic context. It is the relationships between 
artifacts and other data that form the modern archaeological interpretations, 
more so than the artifacts themselves. The lack of context for his data likely 
had the effect of a significant exaggeration of the importance of individual 
artifact types and designs, as opposed to the entirety of an assemblage, which 
led to what Brather (2008:324) called an “atomistic view of culture”. This was 
not unusual and was typical under the culture historical paradigm of the time. 
But such a paradigm, in the hands of a convinced nationalist like Kossinna, 
an individual of significant influence in German academia, was a problematic 
combination.
This was not unknown to Kossinna’s contemporaries, and there was criti­
cism of his ideas. The idea of identifying ethnicity or race through archaeology 
alone had been declared an impossibility by Rudolph Virchow, the preeminent 
German-​antiquarian of the late nineteenth century (Arnold 2006a:10). Kossinna 
co-​opted Virchow’s role in German archaeology after his death and overturned his 
core concepts regarding ethnicity and material culture. However, after 1918 many 
began to regard Kossinna’s work as propaganda, and rather than speak out against 
it, they tended to ignore it. This was exacerbated by Kossinna’s elevated status in 
German academia, and his propensity to bitterly attack any who questioned his 
work. And after Kossinna’s death, his ideas became part of Nazi dogma, and criti­
cizing his ideas was tantamount of criticizing the state, and could meet with harsh 
repercussions (Maischberger 2002:217).
So, what were the specifics of Kossinna’s works, and what were their 
pseudoscientific implications, and lasting effects? Kossinna assume that Germanic 
material culture was inherently superior to non-​Germanic (i.e., Slavic) material 
culture.
…excavated finds that were attributed to Germans were described as aes­
thetically attractive and progressive, whereas Slavic culture was disparaged. 
Thus, Kossina characterized Slavic pottery as “dirty grey” and being of 
“shocking crudeness” ….
Wiwjorra 2014:176

Logically speaking this is a tautology, or “circular reasoning”. High quality and 
aesthetically pleasing pottery were identified as German primarily because it 
was assumed that Germans made fine pottery. Poor quality pottery could not 
be German because it was of poor quality. The possibility of other explanations, 
such as different functions for high-​quality and low-​quality pottery, were never 
considered. And wherever high-​quality pottery was identified, this logic argued, 
one found evidence of a Germanic past, even if that was land that was currently not 
occupied by Germans. There is additionally a huge component of cherry-​picking, 
where “Germanic” artifacts are given more significance and attention than objects 
of poorer quality and thus allegedly non-​German manufacture. And finally, there is 
a healthy dose of confirmation bias. Kossinna and those who followed his agenda 
clearly knew what they wanted the archaeological record to demonstrate, that is, 
German superiority over other peoples, and were more than happy to hammer 
the evidence into that mold.
The distinctions in material culture, fine “Germanic” vs. poor “Slavic”, was 
not simply an assumption of technical proficiency. Kossinna’s interpretations of 
the German past were explicitly based on perceived racial differences. In doing 
so he was building on Gobineau who argued in the nineteenth century all 
nations and peoples could be placed in hierarchy, some peoples were biologically 
superior to others, and the “Nordic” peoples were at the pinnacle of development. 
Following Gobineau’s lead, Kossinna used pseudoscientific cranial distinctions. He 
distinguished between “long heads” of German descent, and “round heads”, basic­
ally everyone else but especially Slavic populations, and hypothesized a millennia-​
long struggle between two (Arnold 2006a:11). So, in Kossinna’s thinking, 
non-​Germans had inferior technology because they were biologically inferior 
beings.
Bettina Arnold (1990, 1998, 2006a, 2006b) has written substantial criticisms 
of Kossinna’s work, their effect on German archaeology, and on German society, 
particularly after his death during the rise of Nazism. She (1990:464) summarizes 
Kossinna’s theoretical perspective that would dominate much of German archae­
ology after his death in 1932 until Germany’s defeat in World War II:
Kossinna proposed cultural diffusion and a process whereby influences, ideas 
and models were passed on by more advanced peoples to the less advanced 
with which they came into contact. This concept, wedded to Kossinna’s 
Kulturkreis theory, the identification of geographical regions with specific 
ethnic groups on the basis of material culture, lent theoretical support the to 
the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany.
Arnold then describes a “Faustian bargain” wherein German prehistoric 
archaeologists, previously marginalized by Classical studies, enjoyed newfound 
support in funding university programs, new museums and institutes, and new 
publications, funded by the Nazi state. But these boons came with the cost that all

research must conform to the racist and nationalist ideals established by Kossinna. 
Prehistoric archaeology thrived in Germany in the 1930s, but only as a tool of 
Nazi ideology and in support of Nazism’s aggressive expansionist agenda. Arnold 
(2006a:12) writes:
This effectively made hypothesis testing and scientifically derived archaeo­
logical research programs difficult if not impossible to carry out after 1933 
unless they could be packaged in a way that conformed to the agenda of 
party officials.
Some archaeologists became active proponents of this Nazi-​friendly archae­
ology and reaped financial and professional benefits, particularly through the 
“SS Ahnenerbe” headed by Heinrich Himmler. Himmler was eager to draw 
connections between modern Germany and an idyllic, pre-​Christian Europe 
in hopes of establishing a neo-​pagan religion to supplant German Catholicism 
(Arnold 2006b:164). Maischberger (2002) relates the case of Sigfried Fuchs, an 
ardent Nazi, member of the SA “Brownshirts” and later the SS. Fuchs was an 
archaeologist of the Classic Era, unusual for Nazi archaeologists who were typically 
prehistorians. But he was highly energetic in using his expertise in Mediterranean 
archaeology to build a case for a Germanic past in Italy. Fuchs left archaeology 
after the war, and German archaeology makes little reference to him or his work 
today. Fuchs was not alone, and many archaeologists who were trained in the early 
twentieth century were happy to oblige Himmler. Arnold states (1990:471) “these 
individuals consciously participated in what was at best a distortion of scholar­
ship, and at worst a contribution to the legitimation of a genocidal authoritarian 
regime”.
Most German archaeologists chose “inner emigration” (Maischberger 
2002:209), taking Nazi money and conducting their research with sufficient lip 
service to ideological purity as to avoid the attention of the authorities. Arnold 
(1990:472) criticizes these Mitläufer archaeologists as “de facto sanctioning of [Nazi] 
policies and attitudes-​a phenomenon that extended into all other areas of public 
life”. A brave few actively spoke out against what they rightly viewed as a per­
version of their discipline, and suffered for it, most being forced into retirement 
or leaving the country. Also, after the enacting of the Nuremberg Laws after 
1935 prominent Jewish archaeologists were forced into retirement or dismissed 
(Maischberger 2002:213).
The question of “what was the harm” in the case of Kossinna’s legacy has 
both obvious and more obscure answers. Obviously, the perversion of a social 
science into a mouthpiece of Nazi propaganda, justifying military aggression 
abroad and genocide within, was calamitous. When I have taught introductory 
archaeology classes the topic of the first lecture is Kossinna, not because of his 
real contributions to the field, but because his case makes such a forceful example 
of the power of past and of its interpretation. There were other, less obvious 
 

142  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology
142
142
negative effects of the exploitation of archaeology by Nazism as well. One effect 
of Kossinna’s pseudoarchaeological legacy included large-​scale looting of arch­
aeological collections during German occupation, particularly in Poland, and 
the suppression of any contradictory academic work in universities in occupied 
nations (Fehr 2018:43).
Entire branches of archaeology, particularly the archaeology of the Classical 
civilizations, was all but extinguished under the Nazi flag. Such cultures were 
deemed elitist and insufficiently Germanic, and their investigation was allow­
able only to the extent that their accomplishments could be misattributed to 
German influence, as was the goal of Fuchs. I would argue that it is always a 
negative when the state is determining what is an appropriate scientific topic of 
study for political and ideological reasons. Baring significant ethical violations, 
the choice of what to research must be left to the researcher and to the scientific 
community.
In addition to the looting of collections, there is also the question of damage or 
destruction of the archaeological record. The Nazi state funded significant archaeo­
logical excavations, but these excavations were conducted under an ideologically-
motivated theory of the past, a theory that was completely erroneous, racist, and 
nationalist. Theory, the underlying paradigm of any science, ideally determines the 
relevant questions to ask and the necessary data to answer those questions. True, 
theories change as knowledge grows and science develops. But in cases such as 
these, where the underlying theory is purely pseudoscientific, any data collected 
is forever tainted and rendered questionable for later research. And since the prac­
tice of excavation is itself destructive, these excavations resulted in the disturbing 
of archaeological sites for no clear gain in knowledge. Bad theory leads to bad 
archaeology that destroys the archaeological record.
While the case of Gustaf Kossinna, and the use of his work in the service 
of Nazism is among the most extreme instances of the use of archaeology for 
nationalist goals, it is hardly the only one. Almost without exception, when 
land is contested between different groups, or when a new group is establishing 
hegemony over a region, you will see archaeology exploited to justify one group’s 
claims over another’s. Archaeology was used as legitimizing tools by the Soviet 
Union, as well as in Communist China. In both communist autocracies, archaeo­
logical interpretations of the past had to support the founding ideology of the 
state, predominantly through extoling the social importance of working classes in 
the past and denigrating the role of elite classes. In return for toeing the party line, 
archaeologists were supplied with significant state support, and massive excavations 
were common. Those few archaeologists brave enough to resist the exploitation 
of their discipline were pushed out of the profession, or worse, with some in the 
Stalinist USSR being sent to labor camps or executed.
The use of archaeology to further nationalist ideologies is not limited to totali­
tarian dictatorship, though these are certainly where you see the most dramatic and 
oppressive examples. However, nationalist archaeology does occur in democratic

143
nations, and when it does it is often less remarked on and thus perhaps more 
insidious. Arnold (2006b) notes how European democracies used misinterpreted 
antiquities, archaeological sites, and historic documents to foster a sense of pan-​
Celtic nationalism in the nineteenth century. This could take the form of assigning 
Celtic ethnicity to specific types of artifacts in ways reminiscent of Kossinna’s attri­
bution of Germanness to antiquities. Sites were misattributed, for example later 
Anglo-​Saxon hill forts were presented as Celtic oppida, and these were then made 
open for public viewing. Most dramatic was the erection of numerous statues and 
monuments to “Celtic” heroes such as Boudica, Vercingetorix, or Armenius, all of 
whom led armed resistance to Roman conquest. As such they made ideal symbols 
for the independence and Celtic past of countries such as the United Kingdom, 
even while these countries had long since been colonized by Anglo-​Saxon and 
later Norman/​French populations.
Nationalist Archaeology in Bosnia
Another example comes from the nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Once 
part of Yugoslavia, from the end of World War I through the end of the Cold 
War, Bosnia and Herzegovina became independent in 1991 in the midst of the 
Yugoslavian civil war. The nation is ethnically diverse, including three major 
groups: Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs. Here we see a young country, founded in a 
bloody conflict, trying to establish a national identity with internal ethnic diver­
sity. This is an ideal situation for nationalist tendencies to develop, and to express 
themselves archaeologically. And such is what we see in the case of the so-​called 
“Bosnian Pyramids”.
In 2005, Semir Osmanagić, a Bosnian-​American businessman with no arch­
aeological training, began making claims that several hills in the Visoki region 
of Bosnia-​Herzegovina were in fact enormous artificial pyramids. The largest of 
these, the “Pyramid of the Sun” was over 700 feet tall, several hundred feet taller 
than the Great Pyramid at Giza (Figure 8.2). To date there have been at least four 
“pyramids” identified, including a “Pyramid of the Moon”, “Pyramid of Love”, 
and “Pyramid of the Earth” as well as alleged temples, tombs, and a system of 
underground tunnels. The pyramids were supposedly the oldest pyramids on earth, 
constructed at least 12,000 years ago, a date based solely on the depth of the 
soil overlying the bedrock “masonry” of the “pyramid”, which is not a legitimate 
means of accurately dating a deposit. So, the 12,000-​year figure is essentially made 
up (though it does agree with various pseudoscientific estimates of the age of the 
nonexistent continent of Atlantis). Later estimates place the supposed structure’s 
construction as early as 34,000 years, well back into the Pleistocene epoch. These 
mammoth monuments were allegedly built by the local Illyrian people and are 
portrayed as evidence that Bosnia was once home to a civilization far older than 
any in the Near East or Asia, capable of monumental constructions that dwarfed 
those of Egypt or Babylon. Substantial governmental funds and external donations 
 
 

144  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology
144
144
were made available for Osmanagić’s exploration of the pyramids, and the sites 
have become popular and profitable tourist destinations, largely on account of 
supposed mystical healing energies emitted by the “structures”.
Osmanagić had made questionable claims in the past. While living in the United 
States he became interested in the pre-​Columbian cultures of the Americas, par­
ticularly those of the Maya. He wrote a book on the topic, in which he claimed that 
the Maya traced their ancestry from the Pleiades (a cluster of stars over 440 light-​
years from Earth), as well as Atlantis. Combining these claims with the pyramid 
claim earned Osmanagić coverage on Ancient Aliens, a fairly common example of 
pseudoscientific cross-​fertilization (Colavito 2012a). In a separate publication he 
has claimed that Hitler and other Nazis escaped to Antarctica after World War II 
(Colavito 2012a). It is not an ad hominem to point these claims out, as they dir­
ectly speak to the credibility and expertise (or lack thereof) of Osmanagić and thus 
the plausibility of any other claims he makes.
Of course, none of Osmanagić’s claims regarding the “pyramids” were true. 
They were natural geological structures. Drillings show they are made of the 
same bedrock as is found throughout the region, and no evidence that they are 
constructed objects. Such “flatiron” hills are very common in the region, and 
often erode into a somewhat pyramidal shape. Pyramids are a physical form that

is most resistant to gravity and tend to form naturally under geologic forces; this 
same stability is why (real) ancient architects adopted the form, or for that matter 
why fruit are stacked in pyramids in supermarkets. These facts have not dampened 
Osmanagić’s claims. For example, he explains the lack of obvious construction 
stones as evidence of the use of ancient concrete, a use of the special pleading 
fallacy.
We should consider the prior plausibility of a claim of monumental archi­
tecture at the time and in the location Osmanagić suggests, which is quite low. 
There is no evidence of monumental construction much earlier than 2,500 
b.c.e., and that is in the Near East. There is no evidence of the use of concrete 
until after 1,500 b.c.e., and the material wasn’t in widespread use until after 600 
b.c.e. in Rome. 12,000 years ago, human cultures were small-​scale foragers, living 
during the end of the last Ice Age. Most of Europe was covered in glacial ice. 
At 34,000 years ago, humans still shared the globe with Neanderthals and all 
manner of extinct Ice Age megafauna, but no pyramids. And the Illyrians, while 
a real culture, have no historic references earlier than the 300’s b.c.e. The so-​
called tunnels, which Osmanagić is “clearing” to their “original” size, are probably 
actually being constructed in real time by that clearing. Unreadable inscriptions 
have been seen on stones that days before were allegedly blank. Osmanagić is at 
best a known pseudoscientist selling fairy tales that would have made Kossinna 
blush at their implausibility. Even geologist Robert Schoch, who was associated 
with a pseudoarchaeological theory that the Great Sphynx was many thousands of 
years older than it is widely believed to be, has dismissed Osmanagić’s work. For 
Osmanagić’s hypotheses to be anywhere near accurate, everything ever written by 
modern archaeologists would have to be glaringly wrong.
Numerous archaeologists and geologists have publicly debunked the pyramid 
theory citing the facts just listed. Several archaeologists have been cited by 
Osmanagić as supporting his work, though they deny this. It is not uncommon 
for pseudoscientists to attempt to associate themselves with legitimate scientists, 
sometimes even stooping to the tactic of tricking them into collaborations under 
false pretenses.
Osmanagić’s answer to criticisms has been to fall back on logical fallacies typ­
ical of pseudoscientists (Hammer and Swartz 2020:97). Archaeologists are so 
wedded to our conventional theories that we are closed minded (an ad hominem). 
Also, those who disagree with the hypothesis do so out of a need to protect the 
tourist industry of Western Europe (a cui bono, “who benefits”? fallacy) that aside 
from being a fallacy is simply not true…mainstream archaeologists do not benefit 
substantially from tourism; if anything, tourism tends to damage archaeology sites, 
and many of those criticizing Osmanagić’s work are not European archaeologists. 
The pyramid hypothesis has in fact been a tourist boon to the local economy and 
has also economically benefited Osmanagić himself. Those who have criticized 
the project have been themselves criticized as being “anti-​Bosnian”. Aside from 
being a way of putting critics on the defensive, this is also a logical fallacy: the false 
 
 

146  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology
146
146
dichotomy. You can be both anti-​pseudoscience and pro-​Bosnian, one does not 
preclude the other.
Far worse than the fact that Osmanagić is selling a false history, is the fact 
that there are real archaeological sites on the Visoki hills, including a medieval 
castle and Roman fortifications. These sites have reportedly been damaged by 
Osmanagić’s inexpert excavations. Even worse, Osmanagić has allegedly carved 
away the sides of several of the hills, to make them more pyramidal. So, not 
only is money, time, and labor being wasted, but real archaeological sites are also 
being damaged. The topsoil of the valley is the matrix that contains legitimate 
archaeological remains, but to Osmanagić that soil is simply fill covering the 
“real” find, the pyramids. So, “uncovering” pyramids has the effect of stripping 
away any real material culture. Archaeologists have reported this (Bohannon 
2006) but have generally done so anonymously lest they be victimized by 
Osmanagić’s powerful supporters.
And to what end? Why has Osmanagić been able to commit such unscientific 
acts? The country had just experienced one of the most traumatic civil wars of the 
twentieth century, and the Visoki region was near much of the fighting. The self-​
immolation of Yugoslavia was one of the most disruptive events of recent times, 
ultimately involving many European countries and the United States through 
United Nations and NATO interventions. The story of the so-​called pyramids, 
while transparently pseudoscientific, brought much needed money to the country, 
through tourism and donated funds. More importantly, the narrative Osmanagić 
was selling brought pride to a very new country recovering from a humiliating 
calamity that was televised across the globe.
Finally, the idea of a glorious prehistory that rivaled the wonders of the 
ancient world was appealing to the government, as it provided a national 
ideology to help unify an ethnically diverse population in the wake of a bloody 
civil conflict.
There is an obvious nationalistic potential lying in wait in a story that 
casts Bosnia and Herzegovina as the site of the world’s oldest and largest 
pyramids. For a recently war-​torn country…this was apparently a very 
attractive message.
Hammer and Swartz 2020:95
And:
In a country still recovering from the 1992-​1995 genocidal war, in which 
some 100,000 people were killed and 2.2 million people were driven 
from their homes (the majority of them Bosnian Muslims), Osmanagić’s 
claims have found a surprisingly receptive audience. Even Bosnian officials-​
including a prime minister and two presidents-​have embraced them, along 
with the Sarajevo-​based news media and hundreds of thousands of ordinary

Bosnians, drawn to the promise of a glorious past and a more prosperous 
future for the battered country.
Woodard 2009
In short, late twentieth-​century Yugoslavia, and the various nations created out 
of its disintegration, created an ideal situation for a nationalistic pseudoscientific 
archaeology.
As has been the case for many of the other examples of pseudoanthropology 
examined in this volume, the media also played a role in the Bosnian Pyramid 
fiasco (Bohannon 2006). Ignoring the sheer implausibility of a human-​made 
structure of such size, of such supposed age, many news outlets presented breathless 
exposés of Osmanagić and his theories. Even the BBC, generally among the 
better outlets for science news, printed a credulous article in 2006 that essen­
tially accepted Osmanagić’s arguments, and offered no real counternarrative, even 
though there were already numerous experts who had dismissed the pyramids 
as natural formations (BBC 2006). In fact, the presence of legitimate antiqui­
ties in the region are mentioned, but the impression the reader of the BBC art­
icle is left with is that the presence of old material in the area actually supports 
Osmanagić’s claims. And no mention is made of the real damage done by the 
excavations. Osmanagić presents himself in a fashion tailored to the popular image 
of an archaeologist, with the obligatory wide brimmed hat, which makes one 
suspect he is playing to an audience more so than pursuing any real investigation.
Currently Osmanagić has been unable to continue excavating on the alleged 
pyramids, the area having been proscribed by the Commission to Protect National 
Monuments established during the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords that ended the 
Bosnian War. But he has continued “excavating” the supposed tunnel system that 
connects the pyramids and has expressed interest in working at other supposed 
pyramids in Eastern Europe. He has also moved on to even more extreme and 
implausible claims of pseudoscientific phenomena associated with the “pyramids”. 
Claims of a healing influence in the region have been long-​standing from those 
involved and are a major draw for tourism. Of late, Osmanagić has made the 
claim that the “pyramids” relate to the work of Nicolai Tesla, and that they emit 
“torsion fields of standing energy” (Austin 2017). He claims this energy propagates 
faster than the speed of light, with no loss of intensity over distance or as it passes 
through intervening matter, which violates several fundamental principles of 
science, including special relativity, the inverse square law, and the second law 
of thermodynamics. Not content with attempting to discredit all of physics, 
Osmanagić has also jumped on the ancient aliens bandwagon, now claiming that 
humans are the result of ancient genetic engineering, and that aliens assisted in the 
construction of the pyramids. That this would seem to undercut earlier statements 
of ancient Bosnian exceptionalism is not addressed.
This is not actually a change for Osmanagić but a return to form. A 2005 volume 
entitled The World of the Maya (Osmanagić 2005) was a purely pseudoscientific

148
treatise on that Classic Period Mesoamerican civilization, published prior to his 
work on the Bosnian “pyramids”. A detailed description of the myriad fallacious 
claims of this volume would be a monograph unto itself, but suffice to say that 
the 50,000-​word document mentions Atlantis 21 times, aliens or extraterrestrials 
12 times, 32 vague references to “frequencies”, and 46 references to “energy” 
including:
And with a frequency in harmony, the Earth will, via the Sun, be connected 
with the center of our Galaxy. These facts become exceptionally important 
when we realize that we are rapidly approaching December 2012, a date 
which the Maya have marked as the time of arrival of the Galactic Energy 
Cluster which will enlighten us.
There’s almost too much nonsense in this paragraph to parse, including 
references to the supposed Maya prediction of a 2012 doomsday (it’s 2022 as 
I write this), unscientific references to energies, frequencies and harmonics, 
and an impending enlightenment. The point here is that Osmanagić has been 
peddling pseudoarchaeology for years before he hit the big time with the Bosnian 
“pyramids”, which actually seem plausible in comparison to his past writing. At 
least they’re real hills.
The examples referred to so far fall into the category of pseudoscience. We 
can speculate as to what degree these figures were aware of the falsity of their 
claims. Kossinna seems to have been a true believer in what he preached, how­
ever factually unmoored by facts many of his arguments were. Osmanagić is less 
clear. Unlike Van Däniken, who had a clear history of fraud before embarking on 
the ancient aliens bandwagon, Osmanagić’s earlier work could have been that 
of a sincere but deeply misguided mind, or even some complex combination of 
both. One could believe in the reality of a pyramid, while still constructing evi­
dence if you are sure it exists somewhere yet to be found, an example of a “pious 
fraud”. There is a monetary interest as well, as Osmanagić’s foundation has earned 
substantial sums in donations including funds from the government of Bosnia-​
Herzegovina. Ultimately it doesn’t matter much as the true measure is not the 
sincerity of belief, but the damage done in misrepresenting the past and damaging 
the archaeological record.
However, most nationalist archaeology involved less obvious and extreme 
misrepresentations of fact. Most often nationalism more subtly affects the course of 
legitimate, scientific archaeology, affecting the questions asked, the data collected, 
and the interpretations made, short of actual falsehood.
Nationalist Archaeology in Israel
A region where this is actively occurring in the world today is the Middle East, par­
ticularly in Israel (Silberman 1982, 1988). The recipe for nationalism exists in that

149
region more so than perhaps anywhere else. It is the home of some of the oldest 
cultures on the planet, a “cradle of civilization”. It is ethnically heterogeneous, with 
many historically conflicting cultures and religions. It is rich in natural resources. 
And most of the nation states that comprise the region are relatively young, many 
of their boundaries established by powerful outsiders after each of the World Wars. 
New nations, struggling to assert control over ethnically and religiously diverse 
populations, struggling against neighbors and competing for resources? It’s not so 
much a question of if nationalism would develop in the modern Middle East, but 
what form it would take and what methods would be used in its service.
That being the case, there are innumerable examples of nationalist archaeology 
in the Middle East, so here we will focus only on one, the case of dueling arch­
aeological narratives in the state of Israel. Israel, founded in the wake of World War 
II and the Jewish Holocaust, a very young nation with a very old culture, striving 
to establish a national identity while surrounded by hostile neighbors, and home 
to some of the most wonderous antiquities in the world. A more fertile soil for 
nationalist archaeology to take root it would be hard to envision.
Archaeology has been enthusiastically consumed by the Israeli public from the 
earliest days of the nation’s existence. Killebrew (2010:127) states:
There is no doubt that for much of the twentieth century archaeology 
played a key role in the formation of Israel’s secular national conscious­
ness and successfully created a perception of a common past among a very 
diverse population composed of large numbers of new immigrants.
And archaeology was deeply intertwined with the Israeli political establishment 
from early on as well. Among the most famous archaeologists working in the nas­
cent Israeli state was Yigal Yadin, who led excavations at several sites of significance 
for the biblical period, including the site of Masada (Figure 8.3). He was also a 
significant military and political figure, at one point serving as the chief of staff for 
the Israeli Defense Forces, and later as Deputy Prime Minister.
Kilbrew singles out the site of Masada, the first century c.e. Judean stronghold 
that is probably the most famous site in Israel. The mountaintop stronghold was 
built by Herod the Great in the first century b.c.e. but is far better known for its 
role in the Judean rebellion against Rome in the late 60s c.e. Masada was occu­
pied by one rebel sect, the Sicarii, during the revolt. A Roman legion laid siege to 
the fortress, ultimately breaching its defenses. The contemporary Jewish historian 
Josephus described the events, and the ultimate mass suicide of the defenders.
Masada’s occupation by Judean rebels and their ultimately doomed resistance 
against Roman occupation is a foundational event in Israeli popular consciousness, 
akin to Valley Forge in the United States. Yadin’s (1966) excavations in the 1960s 
purported to discover physical evidence of the events chronicled by Josephus, 
down to the lots drawn by the defenders to decide who would kill their comrades 
before committing suicide themselves. Kilbrew notes how Yadin emphasized the

site’s association with Jewish populations and their struggle against occupation. 
Silberman (1989:87) notes:
For modern Israelis, deeply concerned with issues of sovereignty and inde­
pendence, the finds at Masada had long offered a tangible link between the

present and the past. The fact that after nearly two thousand years of exile 
Jews returned to reveal the splendor and the tragedy of an earlier national 
existence at that remote mountain in the Judean Desert made Masada a 
powerful political metaphor.
Such was the significance of Masada as a nationalist symbol that it was used as a 
swearing in location for the Israeli tank forces.
This emphasis on the Sicarii occupation and defeat at Masada lessened later 
in the later twentieth century as Israel enjoyed military dominance in the region 
over its Arab neighbors. Currently the site is interpreted in a much broader con­
text including numerous phases of occupation, not solely in light of its role in 
the Judean rebellion. Adding to this decrease in nationalist significance were 
later analyses that indicated that the archaeological discoveries at the site didn’t 
really align well with the events chronicled by Josephus, and the likelihood that 
Josephus’ dramatic account was just that, drama, rather than historical fact. There 
was likely no tragic but noble mass suicide, and the rebels were as like to engage 
in banditry against other Jews as to fight Rome. But Josephus and millennia later 
archaeologists were not the ones to let the facts get in the way of a good story, 
particularly one which supported an ideological position. Joesphus’ goal was to 
point to the futility of resisting Rome; Yadin’s was to point to the once and future 
glory of the Israeli state.
In modern Israel, archaeological sites with biblical significance are visited 
less often than crusader period castles, so much has the nationalist emphasis on 
archaeology lessoned since mid-​century in favor of entertainment and commer­
cialization (Killebrew 2010:127). This contrasts with areas with large indigenous 
Palestinian populations, or Israeli settler populations, such as Jerusalem, or the 
West Bank, where land is still tightly contested, and archaeology and history both 
are manipulated in order to support various territorial claims. The past emphasis 
on sites of the Iron Age and Roman Era, being of biblical relevance, has led to a 
situation where little is known about the prehistoric, Byzantine or Muslim eras. 
Yahya (2010:153) states:
It is quite troubling for Palestinian historians that more is known about Iron 
Age Palestine than bout the Islamic period and Islamic culture, which has 
dominated the landscape of the country and the Middle East as a whole 
over the past 1,400 years.
The lack of attention to later periods of Israeli archaeology means less is known 
of the Palestinian past, fewer sites have been published or are available for public 
interpretation, and the public impression is of a vibrant Jewish past and no 
Palestinian past to speak of.
In addition, the Israeli government has maintained control over archaeo­
logical sites located in territory ceded to the Palestinian authority and acted 
 
 

152  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology
152
152
to add five additional sites on Palestinian land to a formal list of Jewish/​Israeli 
sites (Yahya 2010:144). There is a significant difference in the number of 
trained archaeologists between Israeli and Palestinian populations, with Israeli 
archaeologists outnumbering their Palestinian colleagues many times over (Ilan 
and Gadot 2010:121). To the extent that Palestinians are involved in archaeology 
at all, it is most often as laborers on Israeli projects. And finally, archaeology costs 
money, which is abundantly available for excavations on Israeli territory, while the 
Palestinian authority has much more pressing financial concerns. If Israel has in 
the past used archaeology for Nationalist means, it has also denied Palestinians the 
ability to do the same.
Given the comparison of twentieth-​century archaeology in Germany and 
Israel, some clarifying points are needed lest the reader assumes I am making a 
statement of moral equivalency. While it is true that both Nazi archaeologists and 
Israeli archaeologists used archaeology for nationalist purposes that is really where 
the similarities end. Nazi archaeology was used explicitly to lay claim to foreign 
territory for occupation. Israeli archaeology was used to support claims to terri­
tory in defense of invasion by hostile neighbors.
While there may be systemic barriers to Palestinian involvement in Israeli 
archaeology, in Nazi Germany divergent voices were actively silenced. In 
Israel, interpretations that were contrary to nationalistic ideals, for example the 
reinterpretations of Masada, became part of the archaeological consensus because 
they were simply better interpretations of the data. In Kossinna’s archaeology, data 
was secondary to ideology. And while one might legitimately claim that prior to 
the late twentieth century Israeli archaeology was selective in what sites it chose 
to focus on, this doesn’t invalidate the archaeology itself. By contrast, archaeology 
under the Nazi regime was riven with pure pseudoscience and misrepresentation. 
Our takeaway lesson should be that, while nationalism can affect the course of 
archaeological interpretations in any nation, the damage of nationalist science is 
far worse under totalitarian regimes where the self-​correcting nature of science is 
suppressed in the interest of the state.
One similarity between the two cases, and something that comes up when­
ever nationalism mixes with archaeology, is the increased likelihood of destruc­
tion of the archaeological record. While in the pseudoscientific archaeology of 
early twentieth-​century Germany sites were destroyed through excavation and 
museums were looted under unscientific paradigms, in the Israeli case much of the 
damage comes from outside the professional archaeological community. In making 
certain classes of antiquities into national symbols, those antiquities acquired col­
lectable and monetary value. It was only natural that many would want to own 
some of these potent symbols themselves, which fueled a massive industry in the 
illegal looting and sale of Israeli antiquities in the late twentieth century and up to 
the modern day (Silberman 1989:125).
Such plundering was supported by members of Israeli elite society. Moshe 
Dayan, military hero and Defense Minister during the 1967 Six Day War, possessed

152
153
one of the largest private collections of antiquities in the world, much of which 
was acquired directly by Dayan using military resources and political power. After 
his death in 1981 the collection was sold to the Israel Museum, but the damage to 
the archaeological record in its creation was incalculable. This is perhaps the final 
insult of archaeology undertaken in an ideological, nationalist paradigm. Not only 
does it misrepresent the past for political gain in the present, it destroys evidence 
as it goes, evidence that could be used later to correct the record.
Racist Archaeology and Colonialism in Africa
We turn to a discussion of the political use of archaeology to enforce racist beliefs. 
At the risk of overgeneralization, it could be said that younger, weaker coun­
tries tend toward nationalism (and hence nationalistic archaeology) while older, 
stronger countries have tended toward colonialism and imperialism. Countries 
that are powerful enough to colonize other territories, or to form extensive 
empires, have less of a need to demonstrate power through ideological national­
istic displays. However, such countries must contend with a paradox: their power 
depends on the subjugation of other peoples, which conflicts with a worldview 
that one’s nation is a good nation. For example, the idea of “American exception­
alism” must contend with both the stain of slavery and the genocidal treatment 
of Native Americans. Nobody thinks themselves to be the bad guy, and clear evi­
dence of wrongdoing must be rationalized away somehow. There are many ways 
of doing this, but archaeology has played a major role.
Typically, archaeology in a colonialist or imperialist setting has acted to portray 
the ethnicities of the conquered as inferior to those of the conquerors. Hence, 
I have combined the colonialist and imperialist categories of Trigger based on 
their common focus: racism. For example, during the nineteenth-​century expan­
sion of America into the interior of North America, early American archaeologists 
had the occasion to investigate numerous ruins of ancestral Native Americans. In 
some cases, these prehistoric remains were architecturally sophisticated, such as the 
earthen mounds of the Midwest, which rivaled the ancient wonders of the Old 
World, or the pueblo cities of the Southwest. How to reconcile these past wonders 
with the then current impoverished and marginalized state of Native Americans?
The answer was to use archaeology to separate the two. Until the dawn of 
the twentieth century, it was still common for learned scholars to associate the 
Midwestern Moundbuilders with some “lost race” of advanced people, entirely 
separate from the Native peoples of America. Likewise, the builders of the cliff 
palaces and pueblos of the Southwest were thought to have mysteriously vanished, 
despite living Native groups living in similar if smaller structures. Underlying these 
beliefs was the assumption that Native Americans were racially incapable of such 
constructions, so it must have been someone else, ideally someone more racially 
similar to the European ancestors of the American colonizers. The American trad­
ition of racist archaeology has been abundantly discussed by other authors (e.g., 
 
 

154  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology

Feder 2018), so I turn to a discussion of a similar but less-​discussed example: British 
archaeology in Africa.
In 1867, Adam Render, a big game hunter of German-​American ancestry, was 
involved in a hunting expedition north of the Limpopo river in what was then 
territory controlled by Dutch colonists in Southern Africa. Render and his party 
came upon an amazing sight, a ruined stone settlement spread over three square 
miles, including a massive stone enclosure over 800 feet in circumference with 
walls over as high as 36 feet (Figure 8.4). Render was the first white man to 
encounter what would become known as the site of Great Zimbabwe, possibly 
a contraction of Bantu terms of “stone walls”, also translated as “sacred walls” 
or “ritual seat of a king” (Mcintosh 1998). The site was one of over 300 stone 
structures in the region, but it was the largest stone structure south of the Sahara 
when it was discovered.
While to Render, the site was just one of many wonders he encountered in his 
years in Africa, Great Zimbabwe would become one of the most famous archaeo­
logical sites in Africa outside of Egypt, a key symbol in the post-​colonial African 
struggle, and a major example of racist archaeology.
Surprisingly, Render made little initial effort to inform the world of his dis­
covery (of course, local Native Africans knew the ruins very well, and had an 
extensive folklore regarding their origin and history, most of which was ignored 
by white colonists). In 1871, he brought the German explorer and geographer 
Karl Mauch to the site. Mauch would undertake the first attempt at a scientific 
analysis of the Great Zimbabwe ruins and would also set the stage for generations 
of pseudoscientific racist misinterpretations.
Mauch immediately published speculations that the stone ruins were associated 
with the biblical figure the Queen of Sheba. There are numerous iterations of 
the Queen of Sheba tale in various versions of the Bible, but in all of them she 
was a royal figure from unknown lands south of Israel who brought gifts to King 
Solomon. One interpretation is that this represents contact between the Levantine

155
Holy Land and the Arabian Peninsula, specifically Yemen. The connection of the 
ruins with the Sheba myth was not new; sixteenth-​century Portuguese traders, 
who had heard of the ruins but probably never actually visited them, had already 
made this supposition. Mauch alleged that Great Zimbabwe’s “Great Enclosure” 
duplicated that of the descriptions of the Palace of Sheba from scripture and 
alleged that a wooden lintel at the site was made of Lebanese cedar, proving a 
connection to the land of the Bible (Hall 1995:185). Another possibility Mauch 
endorsed was that the ruins were the remains of a city named Ophir, mentioned in 
the Old Testament as a trading partner with King Solomon, and a source of gold. 
Mauch’s hypotheses regarding the Solomonic associations of the site were widely 
published in the European popular press of the time and gained a wide degree of 
acceptance (Carroll 1988:238). This is again a case of a false but compelling and 
politically convenient narrative being disseminated by popular media.
A later researcher, Theodor Bent, conducted excavations at the site with 
the patronage of Cecil Rhodes. Fontein (2009) notes that Bent was initially 
discouraged by finding only evidence of local, native artifacts at the site. Only 
when he eventually discovered the famous soapstone birds of Great Zimbabwe 
did he believe he finally had his evidence for a foreign, ancient, and exotic origin, 
a classic example of the confirmation bias and cherry-​picking we’ve seen so many 
times in previous examples. Fontein (2009:5) goes on to speak of the political 
context of colonial era research:
Clearly theories of “ancient” and “exotic” origins for Great Zimbabwe 
were of great political use for the British South Africa Company, particu­
larly for Cecil Rhodes. In 1891 he began financing a variety of research 
projects…he commissioned an expedition to, and investigation of, the ruins 
led by Theodore Bent…This was to be the first in a series of “officially 
sanctioned” excavations at Great Zimbabwe which signaled the systematic, 
and institutionalized appropriation of both its past and the site itself.
Swanson (2001:295) elaborates on the same theme:
To the Europeans, the Rhodesian past was a history of conquest and 
exploitation by people rather like themselves. As it had been, so it now 
would be. The fundamental attitude and assumptions in this view were racist 
and supremacist in the Social Darwinist mode of the day: the Africans as a 
degraded and inferior branch of humanity could not have accomplished the 
material achievement evident in the ancient ruins of Mashonaland.
Thus, the site must have been the product of a non-​African culture. The associ­
ation with foreign figures associated with biblical scripture were seen as justifying 
white domination of Africa, providing a false historical and religious legitimation 
of British colonial designs.
 
 
 
 
 

156  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology

By the late nineteenth century, archaeologists, notably Flinders-​Petrie, were 
aware of the achievements of African cultures, notably those of the Egyptians. 
How did Europeans reconcile the advanced Egyptian civilization, while denying 
indigeneity to the Zimbabwe ruins of Mashonaland? The answer is a blatant use of 
ad hoc reasoning or special pleading. Stretching biblical scripture to the breaking 
point, it was hypothesized that Africa was occupied by two distinct races, both 
descended from Ham, the son of Noah. One Hamitic race were the less advanced 
of the two, and represented the peoples of sub-​Saharan Africa, making the wonders 
of Egypt “African” in only a technical, geographic sense (Swanson 2001:299). The 
other Hamitic race was supposedly untouched by the biblical curse that doomed 
the Hamites to primitive servitude. In fact, this speculated advanced Hamite 
population was suggested as a possible creator of the Zimbabwe ruins. In short, 
nineteenth century racists “ret-​conned” the Bible in order to make the facts on 
the ground make sense to their prejudicial worldview.
While Brent did not support Mauch’s earlier speculation of a biblical 
connection, he did argue for significant antiquity of the site, and a connection with 
Semitic groups, possibly Phoenicians, or populations from the Arabian Peninsula. 
Supposedly Arab groups during the seventh-​century Muslim conquest of Arabia 
fled the peninsula across the Gulf of Arabia to set up colonies in the Horn of 
Africa, moving inland to establish Great Zimbabwe. If not the home of the Queen 
of Sheba, Brent still argued that Great Zimbabwe was the product of her people. 
What most Europeans seemed to agree on was that the builders were not the local 
African Shona people living in the area.
Another popular explanation for the Zimbabwe ruins was that they were 
the remains of the kingdom of a figure known as “Prester John”. John was a 
figure popular in European accounts from between 1100 and 1600, during and 
immediately after the Crusades. He was said to rule over an Eastern Christian 
kingdom that which also opposed to Muslim occupation of the Holy Land. The 
legends held that John’s kingdom would attack from the East, while the Christian 
crusaders of Europe would attack from the West, and crush Muslim forces in 
Jerusalem. Of course, no such figure or Eastern Christian kingdom existed, and 
the origins of the myth are murky. Popular belief in the figure of Prester John was 
based in part on a twelfth-​century forgery purported to be a letter from him to 
the emperor of Byzantium.
The supposed location of John’s mythical kingdom has wandered over time 
and through the numerous accounts, initially said to be in India. In fact, a less 
well-​known hypothesis for Great Zimbabwe’s builders was that it was made by 
colonists from India, though Dravidian, not Christian (Carroll 1988:234–​235). 
Later suggested locations of Prester John’s kingdom included Central Asia or Syria, 
and after 1300 it was most popularly held to be in East Africa. Hence, Great 
Zimbabwe was located roughly in the right place to fit the admittedly broad 
details of the Prester John myth, and even as belief in the myth had waned by the 
1800s, the story was compelling enough for some to make the association. Prester 
 

Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology  157
156
157
John appeared as a literary and popular culture figure into the twentieth century, 
even making appearance in both Marvel and DC Comics.
Again, what was most significant was that this idea of a Christian King laid 
the ownership of the ruins not among the local Shona Africans, but with a figure 
associated with Western culture. And as with the Queen of Sheba, the Prester John 
myth was sufficiently vague and varied to incorporate much if one were motivated 
to do so. The idea that the Great Zimbabwe ruins were associated with biblical 
figures (and was therefore relatively old), and that the local Shona were not cap­
able of its construction, was a reoccurring theme in popular fiction during the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Tengri 1990). The famous 1885 novel King 
Solomon’s Mines is the most famous example.
The idea that Great Zimbabwe was something foreign to its setting persisted, 
with early twentieth-​century archaeologists of what was by then Rhodesia, 
a British territory, identifying a final “decadent period” wherein the foreign 
occupants of Mashonaland interbred with the local Africans (Hall and Neal 1902). 
This colonialist interpretation closely follows the Moundbuilder myth of North 
America, where a hypothetical advanced foreign race with Old World roots is 
believed to have been annihilated by indigenous groups, with the local Shona 
standing in for the Native Americans. By racializing the past, identifying territory 
as belonging rightfully to absent enlightened peoples done in by barbaric locals, 
the colonizing group is justified in establishing hegemony over the region. When 
one notes that these archaeological treatises were actually widely read by the white 
elite of Southern African society, who would go on to establish several of the most 
oppressive racist governments in modern history, the very real harm of a racist 
archaeology becomes clear.
Another “archaeologist” (a journalist by trade) working in the Rhodesian 
fashion of the late nineteenth century, with the goal of proving Africans were 
not responsible for the ruins, was Richard Nicklin Hall. Like Bent before him, he 
discovered only locally made artifacts at Great Zimbabwe, even excavating the site 
near to bedrock in an effort to find the fine Semitic remains he was sure must be 
there. This involved ignoring substantial artifacts of gold and other valuables in the 
layers he discarded as late African intrusions.
Not deterred, Hall simply gathered up the valuables…and arranged them 
schematically according to his pre-​conceived chronological and racial typ­
ology: the “fine” things earlier, the “crude” things later. Thus he “proved” the 
myth he believed, despite what he actually found.
Swanson 2001:296
The similarity to the circular reasoning of Kossinna are unavoidable. The real 
patterns in the archaeological record are ignored or reordered to suit a racist pre­
conception. That false constructed past is then used to justify both racist theories 
of ancient society and the present political agenda. There was more direct harm 
 
 
 

158  Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology

done as well, with much of the finally crafted artifacts that was recovered by Hall 
being either destroyed or collected by wealthy white elite, including Cecil Rhodes 
himself (Swanson 2001:296).
Limited excavations by David Randall-​MacIver, a student of Flinders-​Petrie, 
led him to argue for a relatively recent, medieval construction of the site, finding 
only indigenous artifacts, and foreign artifacts datable to the mid second millen­
nium, which implied an indigenous origin (Randall-​MacIver 1906). However, 
due to the limited nature of the excavations and the heterodox nature of his 
conclusions, little attention was paid. Only in 1929, with the presentation of 
Gertrude Caton Thompson’s (also a Flinders-​Petrie protégé) research at Great 
Zimbabwe, did its true status as a Native monumental construction begin to see 
wider consideration (Hall 1995:192). Caton Thompson noted, for example, that 
ceramics from the site fit in a sequence with indigenous ceramics for the region, 
arguing for in situ development.
Caton Thompson is a notable figure even aside from her involvement with 
Great Zimbabwe, as a well-​established female archaeologist in a time when the 
discipline was heavily male dominated. She also was heavily criticized for her 
conclusions regarding the indigeneity of Great Zimbabwe from many in the arch­
aeological community, so entrenched was the view that the site had to have been 
foreign and could not have been made by local Africans. Even Caton Thompson 
emphasized the perceived “infantile” savagery of the site’s builders. Even when 
confronted with material evidence of fully modern human behavior, the dom­
inant narrative through much of the twentieth century tended to rationalize the 
evidence away. Even an advanced structure still had to be made by a primitive 
people, because the racialized ideology of the colonial archaeologist could not 
conceive of any other possibility.
Despite the Rigor of Caton Thompson’s work, it was not deemed convincing 
by the local white settlers.
The desire of the White settlers to believe the legends about “superior” 
colonists from exotic lands of the ancient world was so great that Caton 
Thompson’s conclusions were rejected by them.
Shaw 1992:34
The lack of radiocarbon dating or any other sort of absolute dating method did not 
help Caton Thompson’s case, as she had no objective way to validate her relatively 
recent chronology for the site. That said, after her publication on the excavations, 
her interpretations were widely seen as accurate by professional archaeologists 
outside of southern Africa, and the “mystery” of Great Zimbabwe became pri­
marily a local myth perpetuated for political reasons.
The modern interpretation (see Garlake 1970, 1973, 1982) of Great Zimbabwe 
is that the site was a royal residence for local ruling figures of the Gokomere

people, the ancestors of the modern Shona. The rich soils of the region allowed for 
significant population growth during the first millennium c.e., and a local social 
hierarchy developed. Local resources, including gold and ivory, allowed the local 
elite to engage in luxury trade with outlying populations, further increasing their 
wealth and power. Numerous monumental stone structures are found in between 
the Limpopo and Zambezi rivers, all associated with this elite. Great Zimbabwe is 
really notable only in terms of its great relative size; otherwise, it is simply one of 
many medieval elite compounds.
The various stone structures of the site, covering over 700 hectares, were 
constructed between c.e. 1000 and 1300. The site was likely occupied until 
approximately 1450 and may have been the home to as many as 10,000 people. In 
addition to its role as a royal residence, Great Zimbabwe also served as a trading 
hub in a network covering sub-​Saharan Africa, supplying gold, ivory, and incorp­
orating goods from as far away as China (Chirikure and Pikirayi 2008:981). There 
was also a significant stone carving industry, notably including the soapstone bird 
effigies (Huffman 1985). Changing trade patterns, climatic change, and exhaustion 
of local gold mines likely led to the site’s decline and abandonment. In short, it was 
like many cities that sprang up during and after the African iron age, albeit one 
off the most monumental. The story of Great Zimbabwe is not a story of foreign 
settlers in a strange land; it is an African story of African achievements. This story, 
however, inconceivable during the nineteenth century, was still to see resistance 
during the twentieth century.
The nation of Rhodesia was established in 1965 as a white minority ruled 
state, separate from the British Commonwealth to which the territory had previ­
ously belonged. Rhodesia was established explicitly to prevent the post-​colonial 
transition to indigenous African majority rule that was sweeping Africa at the 
time. Research at the site of Great Zimbabwe continued in Rhodesia even as 
the country fought the Bush War against insurgents. The interpretations of the 
site were once again tools for a racialized nationalist ideology, with any arguing 
for an indigenous origin (which was by then the consensus opinion among 
archaeologists) facing sanction and persecution.
The Rhodesian government lent support to interpretations of a foreign 
origin right out of the 1800s. One popular example was renewing earlier 
emphasis on a presumed Indian or Indo-​African origin, based in part on 
spurious linguistic similarities (Swanson 2001:306) like those used by 
Afrocentrists to argue for a spurious African–​New World connection. One 
proponent of this baseless idea, Lord Robert Gayre, an amateur anthropolo­
gist and heraldry expert, dismissed what he termed “pro-​Bantuism” arguing 
“the obsession to prove a theory can become so great that, unconsciously, all 
evidence is twisted to justify the thesis” (Gayre 1972:22). Gayre’s skill at pro­
jection was eclipsed only by his immunity to irony, as he and his diffusionist 
cohort were guilty of the very same logical error.

Several well-​known archaeologists resigned from major Rhodesian institutions 
in protest of this policy, as nineteenth-​century racial pseudoarchaeology ideas had 
become government policy. One of the archaeologists forced out of the country 
was Peter Garlake, who wrote the definitive (factual) book on Great Zimbabwe 
(1970). Garlake was forced into exile in 1970.
Garlake’s research on Zimbabwe type monuments led him to attribute their 
authorship to ancestors of the Karanga – ​a conclusion that was considered 
unacceptable to the white settler community in Rhodesia, especially the 
government of Ian Smith, which had unilaterally declared independence 
from Britain in 1965 and was highly prejudiced against the black majority, 
whom it perceived to lack the technical sophistication and complexity 
needed to construct such structures. Ian Smith went on to hire pseudo-​
archaeologists who were tasked with challenging Garlake’s conclusions, 
since they strongly undermined white settler ideology, which preferred to 
see Great Zimbabwe and related monuments as the works of a mysterious, 
alien civilization.
Pikirayi 2012:224
As with the Bosnian Pyramids, we again see a case of a government specifically 
meddling in archaeological research, though instead of trying to instill nationalist 
pride, in this case the goal was to denigrate an entire people.
Following the dissolution of Rhodesia in 1980, and the establishment of a 
majority rule Government, the country was renamed Zimbabwe, in honor of the 
site, an image of which now graces the Zimbabwean flag. Excavations at the site 
were largely halted after 1980 in favor of preservation. Peter Garlake did return to 
Zimbabwe in 1981, though he spent his remaining years in the study of rock art, 
perhaps a less politically charged topic.
During the post-​colonial era, we still see the divisiveness of racialization affecting 
the interpretation of the site. Should the past research mainly by British scholars 
be discounted entirely? Should only African scholars have a place in interpreting 
Great Zimbabwe? Such has been the argument of Ken Mufuka, Zimbabwean dir­
ector of Museums and Monuments. Mufuka sought to reframe Great Zimbabwe 
as a socialist monument whose rulers redistributed their wealth to the common 
people, in the absence of any supporting evidence. This is another of the dangers 
of racist archaeology; there is generally a backlash when local rule is established, 
and the colonial power is sent packing. But that backlash can be no more scien­
tifically rigorous and every bit as politically, racially, and ideologically motivated as 
the racist archaeology of the colonizers. Either way, the real past is distorted if not 
lost. Swanson (2001:315) notes:
 
 

Archaeology as the Handmaiden of Ideology  161
160
161
Although well aware of Great Zimbabwe as a symbol of past achievement 
and present aspirations, African nationalists and Black Consciousness leaders 
promoted uniformed “utopian” visions of the past. With archaeology aligned 
in the popular view with white domination, Mufuka’s attitude was and 
understandable if unfortunate one. Thus may history be hostage to interest, 
error and ideology in each generation.
Will Great Zimbabwe now play a role like Israel’s Masada, as a nationalist symbol 
in a relatively newly born country? Whatever the answers to these questions, the 
evidence shows that the very concept of race, and the racialization of archaeology, 
is poisonous to any objective reconstruction of the past. For example, one out­
come of the past racialized treatments of Great Zimbabwe and related antiquities 
by colonial regimes has been an alienation of African Zimbabweans from their 
own history (Pwiti and Ndoro 1999). There is often a sense of ambivalence on 
that part of local populations to ancient sites in their midst, since these sites were 
previously manipulated as symbols of their own oppression.
This has potentially damaging effects on preservation and management, and 
leaves these irreplaceable historic resources subject to looting, vandalism, and nat­
ural decay. Great Zimbabwe has already been subject to such damage, with most 
of the in situ artifacts within the Great Enclosure having been stripped away in 
the late nineteenth century by those assuming the site was foreign and seeking 
to remove any evidence of African occupation (Mcintosh 1998). At the time this 
likely delayed the recognition of Great Zimbabwe’s true indigenous nature, and it 
is easy to see how future damage to the site may similarly impede research.
I will conclude by arguing that the Great Zimbabwe controversy, and racist or 
nationalist archaeologies in general, are examples of a core concept in scientific 
skepticism: motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning occurs when there is some 
factor that drives one’s thinking toward a preferred conclusion, rather than toward 
a purely evidence-​based conclusion. You can think of motivated reasoning as a 
category of cognitive error that incorporates a range of more specific biases and 
fallacies, including confirmation bias, cultural preconceptions, implicit bias, and 
others.
To illustrate this with concrete examples, Karl Mauch was already convinced 
that the gold fields of Ophir existed in Africa north of the Limpopo, and thus it 
is no great surprise that he identified the first substantial ruins he encountered as 
that mythical lost city. His reasoning was motivated toward that conclusion before 
he ever saw the first stone of Great Zimbabwe. That same motivation blinded him 
to the essential similarity of Great Zimbabwe to the many less imposing stone 
structures in the region, and to the lack of any corroborating historical or physical 
evidence of foreign presence. The racist bias of European explorers, colonialists, and 
settlers was a motivating factor that prevented most from reaching what, in hind­
sight, was the obvious conclusion: that the Zimbabwe stone sites are all indigenous 
structures of recent origin. And the racist and nationalist agenda of the Rhodesian

state motivated the white minority in general, and archaeologists in particular, to 
actively deny the indigeneity of the site. In all these cases, as in so many examples 
in this volume, the reasoning of the researchers was motivated away from the pre­
ponderance of evidence and toward a conclusion that fit existing biases.
In the final chapter we will investigate what general themes can be derived 
from the various case studies presented.

SCIENCE, PSEUDOSCIENCE, AND 
ANTHROPOLOGY
In the preceding chapters I have attempted to build a series of arguments relating 
to pseudoscience both in general and in anthropology. Where does anthropology 
sit in relation to the concept of science? In order to understand what “bad anthro­
pology” is we must come to some agreement about what “good anthropology” is, 
and how that relates to the practice of science in general.
This is a challenging proposition since anthropology is a highly diverse field, 
ranging from the highly objective study of the hominin fossil record to the more 
interpretive study of folklore and mythology. What is shared among these diverse 
topics that makes them legitimate, and opposed to illegitimate pseudoscience?
At the very least all the myriad approaches in anthropology share an evidence-​
based approach. The nature of the evidence varies as do the topics of study, but 
there should always be consensus on what comprises valid evidence. Evidence 
forms the basis of conclusions; conclusions can’t determine evidence. And should, 
in the course of further study, additional evidence contradict prior conclusions, 
the consensus regarding those conclusions must change to fit the new evidence. 
Science is a living and constantly improving practice. Anthropology, like any 
human endeavor, is not perfect, but like any science, it is continually evolving 
toward perfection.
Having defined the scientific validity of anthropology, at least as ideally 
practiced, what can we say about the various examples of pseudoanthropology? 
One fundamental is that there is no subfield or specialization within the big tent 
of anthropology that has not seen some colonization by pseudoscience. While my 
own subfield of archaeology has seen the most widely popularized pseudoscience, 
particularly in the example of the ancient astronaut hypotheses, the examples cited 
from this volume show pseudoscience in cultural, biological, and linguistic anthro­
pology as well. I would argue that pseudoscience in these subfields is potentially 
 
 

164  Science, Pseudoscience, and Anthropology
164
164
more threatening than is the case for pseudoarchaeology, since their lower public 
awareness has let them fly under the radar. There are entire courses and books spe­
cifically aimed at debunking pseudoscience in archaeology; the same cannot be 
said for other subfields of anthropology.
Taking all the examples cited in this volume, we can identify several common 
themes that reoccur with pseudoanthropology. There is of course the repeated 
dependence of fallacious logic, and the handicapping influence of cognitive biases. 
People cherry pick the data that supports their preconceived explanations, while 
confirmation bias limits awareness of more plausible explanations, to name but one 
albeit common example. But we can go deeper than that, and identify situations 
where pseudoscience is most likely to occur. These are not limited to anthro­
pology but increase the likelihood of pseudoscience in general.
One common theme is that the prevalence of pseudoscience seems to 
increase with the degree to which one stands to gain personally. While it is 
true that academics are often undercompensated, when significant amounts of 
money, fame or influence are on the table it is a temptation to cut corners of 
scientific rigor. Significant personal, professional, or monetary gain encourages 
bad actors to continue, and provide little motivation to adopt legitimate science. 
This goes beyond the admittedly problematic issue of researcher bias, manipu­
lation of data (to make equivocal results seem positive), or even outright fraud. 
Castaneda cut so many corners he ended up with a circle but made huge sums 
of money in the process. By all accounts an intelligent academic with a great 
deal of potential in his youth, the lure of publisher advances for writing “anthro-​
fiction” was clearly too great to pass up. Von Däniken likewise made a fortune in 
book royalties, and there’s no indication that this not his primary goal. He wasn’t 
lured to the dark side; he was already a permanent resident when Chariots of the 
Gods was published.
In other cases, the benefits were more in the way of influence within the dis­
cipline than in money, and in these cases the pseudoanthropology is mixed with 
legitimate science. While Chagnon exhibited questionable methods and came to 
problematic conclusions, there’s also no evidence of outright fraud. Still, he saw his 
star rise high into the academic firmament because his results were enticing even 
to seasoned anthropologists. The problem of course in mixing pseudoanthropology 
with anthropology is the bad invalidates the good. I would speculate that the 
professional advancement and fame accorded to figures conducting questionable 
research is a major factor in their failings.
The examples covered in the book also seem to fall into two categories: obvious 
frauds and hoaxes, or people who believe what they are arguing even though their 
argument is based on bad evidence and flawed logic. In the case of the former, 
some degree of personal gain is the most prevalent explanation. Even while such 
fraud in science is morally repugnant, doing so for a tangible benefit at least follows 
a type of logic, albeit perverse and self-​centered logic.
 

Science, Pseudoscience, and Anthropology  165
164
165
In the case of the “true believers” a more nuanced explanation if necessary, 
and a huge part of that explanation in all such cases I’ve investigated is confirm­
ation bias on the part of the person making the argument. Any evidence, even 
poor quality or equivocal evidence, that could be taken as supporting an implaus­
ible hypothesis becomes ironclad proof in their mind, while any disconfirming 
evidence is either ignored or explained away by post hoc rationalization. Any 
semblance of communication from an allegedly sign-​reading ape is taken as proof 
that the animal is fluent. But numerous examples of nonsensical or erroneous 
output, or the fact that only one or a few researchers can get results, is ignored. 
If taken into appropriate consideration, this shows that most of the communica­
tion is either coincidental or is actually being done unconsciously by the animal’s 
handler, like some living Ouija board.
Or in the case of anomalous inscriptions, such as the Newark Stones or the 
Kensington Stone, the researcher’s desire to believe in their validity led them to 
ignore anachronistic phrasing, questionable archaeological context, or incon­
gruous circumstances of discovery. In both these cases ideology plays a role, 
unconscious beliefs that color the information being collected. A deep conviction 
that nonhuman animals are active agents deserving of protection (with which I do 
not disagree) might lead a researcher to overestimate the cognitive capacity of the 
animals and ignore evidence to the contrary. A love for one’s ethnicity might lead 
you to overestimate the likelihood of an ancestral claim to the land one lives on, 
even giving credence to an obvious forgery like Kensington.
When confirmation bias takes over, the scientific process is perverted, with 
the conclusion put first rather than at the conclusion of an argument. An actor 
commits to a preferred interpretation of evidence at the outset of an investiga­
tion, and ignores contrary evidence, or warps it to fit that preconceived idea. If 
you look specifically for one thing, you will find it, whether it’s there or not, and 
you’ll miss all the other evidence of what’s really going on. Having an a priori 
conviction is not the same as generating a hypothesis. An a priori conviction is 
almost immune to refutation. And refuting a hypothesis is the whole point of the 
scientific method.
A third common theme is the role of ideology in determining the shape of 
interpretations of anthropological data. Ideology has seen a range of definitions 
over the years, ranging from very specific, to very general. I adopt an expansive 
definition, including usually unconscious assumptions about social relations, par­
ticularly social relations that have to do with power and influence. Ideology, be it 
political, religious, or something else, creates prevalent societal biases, which lead 
researchers to favor certain conclusions over others. One could look at this as 
essentially a specific instance of confirmation bias toward interpretations that will 
confirm ideological beliefs.
Referring to an example from the beginning of the volume, given the ideology 
of British exceptionalism during the early twentieth century, it was probably 
 

166  Science, Pseudoscience, and Anthropology
166
166
inconceivable to those investigating the Piltdown skull that it was anything other 
than what it as alleged to be: evidence that the origins of humanity were British. 
And it was equally inconceivable that these origins could have been African or 
Asian, which was in fact where the evidence was already trending at the time. That 
same racist ideology made it very difficult to envision a complex and advanced 
African society in southern Africa, so Great Zimbabwe must have been a for­
eign intrusion, an ideologically driven conclusion that would eventually become 
state policy in Rhodesia. And while it is my suspicion that the most prominent 
proponents of the ancient aliens hypothesis are well aware of its falsehood, the 
idea has gained so much traction in popular culture in large part due to the innate 
racism of the readers and viewers. These consumers have in effect been ideologic­
ally preconditioned to accept the basic premise, that non-​Western, non-​white 
populations were not capable of complex constructions, so aliens are the more 
plausible explanation.
We see similar ideological blinders repeatedly throughout examples in this 
volume. Pseudolinguistic theories purporting a pre-​Columbian African presence 
in the Americas are based less on physical or legitimate linguistic evidence as 
much as they are founded on Pan-​African ideology. The fact that this ideology 
arose in direct reaction to generations of exploitation of Africa and Africans does 
not make Pan-​African theories, linguistic or otherwise, correct given the exten­
sive evidence against them. Similarly, pseudolinguistic hypotheses that Turkish, 
or its linguistic ancestor, were in some way primordial languages from which 
many modern languages arose were just window dressing on a nationalist ideology 
popular in a newly established Turkish state.
One wonders if the Tasaday or Castaneda hoaxes would have had the appeal 
they did outside of the antiestablishment romanticized ideology of the late 
Vietnam War era. Kossinna’s racism and nationalism both fed his distorted inter­
pretation of European prehistory and were easily adapted to the equally racist and 
nationalist ideology of the Nazi state. The widespread acceptance of the Bosnian 
“pyramids” within Bosnia, despite their rejection by archaeological consensus, is 
another example of nationalistic ideology influencing archaeological interpret­
ations. And, even if not nationalist per se, the Kensington hoax plays to an innate 
sense of ethnic pride on the part of Midwestern Americans of Scandinavian des­
cent, again, an ideological predisposition to accept what is upon even cursory 
investigation a highly implausible claim.
In all of these themes, there is a central fact: anthropology, as the “study of 
humanity”, has the ability to both shape, and be shaped by, popular opinions 
about humanity. It can create and recreate bias, it can be distorted by popular 
misconceptions and prejudice. Only through recognizing and drawing continued 
attention to these examples can anthropology make legitimate contributions to 
human knowledge. Anthropology is both an excellent example of the ways in 
which pseudoscience can insinuate itself into an otherwise legitimate field of 
study, and in doing so cause real harm to both the science and the society in 
 

Science, Pseudoscience, and Anthropology  167
166
167
which it is practiced. This is not an issue that anthropology, or any science, has 
outgrown. It takes continued awareness and vigilance to prevent pseudoscience 
from taking root in the popular consciousness. Fortunately, anthropology, with 
its focus on studying belief, culture, and society, is an ideal platform for recog­
nizing and critiquing pseudoscience. We just need to make a continued effort 
to do so.
