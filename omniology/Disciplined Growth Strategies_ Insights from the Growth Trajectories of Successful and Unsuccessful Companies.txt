Acknowledgments
This book has benefited greatly from the help of many people.
I could not have embarked on this project without the enthusiastic support of 
Keith Rollag who chairs the Management Division at Babson. Len Schlesinger, 
former Babson College president and currently Baker Foundation Professor 
at Harvard Business School was particularly helpful in providing insightful 
suggestions about how to structure the chapters. My Management Division 
colleagues Dwight Gertz, Wendy Murphy, and Jonathan Sims all provided 
helpful suggestions. Thanks also go to my college classmate, Chris Lamb, for 
his insightful feedback on many chapter drafts. Finally, thanks go to my Babson 
students who inspired this book with their struggles to develop effective 
growth strategies for the many companies we studied.
Without Apress this book would not exist. I am most grateful to Robert 
Hutchison for his enthusiastic support of the idea for this book and for the 
outstanding project management and editing help from Rita Fernando Kim 
and Laura Berendson.
Finally, I could not have completed this book without the help of my wife, 
Robin, who patiently read and commented on many of the chapters; and my 
children, Sarah and Adam, who always make me proud.

Introduction
I was the poster child for a confused adolescent. In college, I stumbled through 
a series of seemingly random career aspirations—concert pianist, poet  
(my father dissuaded me from this career choice by asking to look up ‘poet’ 
in the Yellow Pages), and architect—before realizing in my senior year that 
I wanted a career that combined my interests in computers and business 
strategy.
So I set my sites on becoming a strategy consultant—helping companies 
identify, evaluate and profit from growth opportunities—which I have done in 
various guises ever since.
Back then, consulting firms hired newly minted MBAs, rather than college 
graduates as they do these days.
While doing graduate studies in computer science at MIT, I met with the 
director of career counseling at its Sloan School of Management who 
introduced me to Index Systems, a consulting firm founded by four former 
Sloan School professors.
I found out that consulting firms hired very talented people and provided 
opportunities for traveling and working on a variety of interesting projects. 
Index focused on helping managers use technology to boost business 
performance.
I decided that I was most interested in strategy work, so after earning an MBA 
at The Wharton School, I went to work for Monitor Company—a strategy 
consulting firm cofounded by Harvard Business School strategy guru, Michael 
Porter.
My years there were a supremely intense learning experience. Thanks to what 
partners saw as a talent for turning Porter’s ideas into processes for leading 
client teams, I was quickly promoted to managing consultant teams.
Ultimately, the demanding travel burned me out and I spent the next few years 
working as an internal consultant in the banking and insurance industries.
In 1994, I took a chance and started my own consulting firm that provided 
strategy consulting for large, high-technology companies. This happened at a 
lucky time in economic history—the Internet was emerging as a major force 
for business growth.

Introduction
xiv
My consulting business boomed, I wrote several books—including Net Profit—
which made me a regular on TV networks such as CNBC and an in-demand 
speaker at business conferences around the world.
I also began investing in start-ups—since then, I have funded seven private 
companies. Three of those were sold for over $2 billion.
In 2001, I began teaching at Babson College—which U.S. News and World Report 
has ranked the top U.S. entrepreneurship school for the last two decades.
After teaching part time, I became a full-time lecturer in 2014 and was 
promoted to a Lecturer of Strategy in 2016. I teach MBA and undergraduate 
courses such as Strategy and the CEO, Strategic Decision Making, Strategic 
Problem Solving, and Foundations of Entrepreneurial Management.
I also created and lead offshore Start-Up Strategy electives to Hong Kong 
and Singapore, Israel, Spain and Portugal, and Paris. In these courses, students 
visit with start-ups, venture capitalists, and accelerators and conduct six-week 
consulting projects for start-ups.
This brings me to why I wrote this book. In almost every course, I assign 
students the challenge of analyzing a company’s problems and figuring out how 
to solve them.
By far the most frequent problem they encounter is that the company is not 
growing profitably. Sadly, their solutions to that problem are at best uneven in 
their originality and likely effectiveness.
This problem is not limited to students—the vast majority of CEOs struggle 
unsuccessfully with the challenge of how to revive a moribund company or 
how to sustain the growth of a company that has done well in the past.
I realized that it’s unfair to expect students to come up with great growth 
strategies unless they have a practical road map for doing so.
In February 2016, I wrote a “Note on Growing Faster” to help remedy 
the problem. A more concise version of the “Note” was published as “Five 
Commandments for Faster Growth.”1
But I concluded that in order to provide sufficient depth into how to craft 
successful growth strategies, I should write a book.
Disciplined Growth Strategies Road Map
If your organization needs disciplined growth, this book will explain how to 
achieve it in two parts.

Introduction
xv
Part I. Exploring the Five Dimensions of Growth
Chapters 2 through 6 examine how companies pursue growth along each of 
the five dimensions of growth—customers, geographies, products, capabilities, 
and culture.
For each of these chapters, Part I covers the following topics:
• 
Definitions of key terms and concepts, where appropriate.
• 
Summary of key principles for achieving growth through 
the dimension addressed in the chapter.
• 
Case studies of successful and unsuccessful large and 
small companies pursuing growth from the current or a 
new growth vector.
• 
Lessons learned from the cases about what to do and 
what to avoid.
Part II. Constructing Growth Trajectories
This second part of the book consists of its concluding chapter in which we 
will explore how companies chain together some or all of these dimensions 
into growth trajectories. Drawing on an analysis of Forbes 2000 companies, 
Chapter 7 does the following:
• 
Identifies the fastest and slowest growing companies.
• 
Describes the growth trajectories of the fastest and 
slowest growing companies.
• 
Analyzes the logic underlying the decisions to follow 
those growth trajectories.
• 
Highlights the most useful takeaways for leaders in what 
principles to pursue and which to avoid in constructing 
growth trajectories.
Chapter 8. Road Maps
Road maps for leaders to capture growth from each dimension using examples 
from the cases in the chapter.

Introduction
One of the most important challenges that leaders face is to devise and exe-
cute strategies that speed up revenue growth. Not growing fast enough can be 
costly for executives and investors. Take the example of LinkedIn, the business 
social network service. After markets opened on February 5, 2016, investors 
hacked 44% from the company’s shares. The reason was easy to understand, 
yet difficult to remedy. LinkedIn lowered its expectations for the year’s growth 
in revenue (from 35% to 20%) and adjusted earnings (from 41% to 7%)—well 
below what analysts expected. This slashed a cool $1 billion from the net 
worth of LinkedIn’s founder, Reid Hoffman, and forced its CEO, Jeffrey Weiner, 
to ponder important questions that must be answered before investors could 
hope to recoup what they had lost.
Where would faster growth come from? Could it be spurred by improving 
LinkedIn’s offerings? By selling its current products to new customers, or in new 
geographies? By inventing new products for its existing customers? By adding 
entirely new classes of products, or creating a new growth culture? Ultimately, 
LinkedIn failed to answer these questions. On June 13, 2016, Microsoft paid a 
50% premium over the previous day’s price—$26.2 billion—to acquire LinkedIn. 
The deal restored LinkedIn shareholders to where they were before that fateful 
February day. And it let Weiner off the hook. He was no longer under pres-
sure to conceive and implement an effective growth strategy for LinkedIn—that 
would become the responsibility of Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella.
LinkedIn’s growth challenge was just one side of the growth coin. The other 
is growing too fast—in a manner that boosts short-term revenues and stock 
price but is ultimately unstainable and leads to collapse. A case in point is Laval,

Quebec-based pharmaceutical manufacturer Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Former 
McKinsey consultant Michael Pearson advised Valeant as an outside consultant 
in 2007—and took over as its CEO in 2008. In the seven years that followed, 
Pearson cut risky R&D (research and development) and made acquisitions—
drastically raising the prices of its existing approved drugs. The result was a 
more than 1,000% spike in Valeant’s stock price through early 2015—winning 
Pearson a $1 billion fortune. Valeant fell apart in September 2015 when its 
drug pricing policies came under attack—slashing 90% from the stock’s 2015 
peak value. Pearson was dismissed from Valeant’s CEO slot. While LinkedIn’s 
disappointing growth demonstrates the challenges that face executives who 
can’t achieve enough growth, Valeant’s implosion shows the high price that 
leaders pay for growing too fast with a strategy that can’t be sustained.
The unfortunate truth is that very few executives can think of creative, practi-
cal solutions to such questions. To me this suggests a crying need for growth 
discipline. By this I mean a systematic process for brainstorming, evaluating, 
choosing, and implementing growth strategies that produce the kind of better-
than-expected revenue and profit growth that boosts shareholder value—and 
makes it easier for leaders to attract and motivate top talent.
Why Growing Faster Matters
Growth creates opportunities for your people to develop their skills. It 
attracts the best talent to your company (and away from rivals), and it creates 
wealth for you and your investors. Moreover with the world economy strug-
gling to grow at all, start-ups and public companies are increasingly falling into 
two categories—the vast majority that are stagnating and declining, and a tiny 
minority that are enjoying accelerating growth. Languishing public companies 
become fodder for so-called activist investors who buy a small stake, lobby 
hard for splitting the company into pieces, and clamor for board seats.
Consider the case of DuPont. In 2014, veteran activist investor, Nelson Peltz, 
bought a 2.7% stake in the chemical conglomerate and demanded that it break 
itself into pieces. While Peltz lost a proxy battle in May 2015, he won the war 
in October 2015 when DuPont’s CEO, Ellen Kullman, resigned under pressure 
after a 46% drop in quarterly profits from the year before. Ultimately, Peltz got 
a split up—but not in the form he wanted. In December 2015, DuPont and 
Dow Chemical merged at a value of $120 billion with the idea that they would 
cut $3 billion in costs and two years later split into three public companies 
focusing on agricultural, materials, and so-called specialty products.
For top executives, such interventions are hugely distracting and often career 
ending. The desire to avoid such distractions should spur CEOs to lead their 
companies to much faster growth that boosts their stock price to a level that 
makes it harder for activist investors to flip for a quick profit. Shrinking pri-
vate companies are even more vulnerable. Chances are good that they will

not attract investment, will burn through their remaining cash, and shut down. 
Simply put, boards must ensure that their CEO is achieving rapid growth or 
has a compelling plan to deliver it. Otherwise, they should find a CEO who can.
Growth Challenge Varies by Company Size and 
Growth Trajectory
Growing faster is always a difficult challenge.
However, as illustrated in Figure  1-1, the nature of that challenge varies 
depending on the size of the company and its growth trajectory.

This 
Westborough, 
Massachusetts-based data storage supplier had grown to 
nearly 800 employees by December 2015 with revenues 
increasing 50% in the third quarter of 2015. By November 
2016, SimpliVity’s CEO, Doron Kempel, faced three chal-
lenges. Its biggest partner, Cisco Systems, was building 
a product to compete with SimpliVity’s. Its larger rival, 
Nutanix, had gone public—raising significant capital that it 
could invest in sustaining its market lead. And SimpliVity 
was so eager to raise new—but its stock had since dropped 
considerably. Capital that rumors surfaced that it might be 
acquired for as much as $3.9 billion by Hewlett Packard 
Enterprise (HPE). In January 2017, HPE acquired SimpliVity 
for a disappointing $650 million in cash.1

• 
Fiksu (small, declining). This Boston, Massachusetts-based 
mobile app marketing algorithm developer had grown 
from less than $1 million in 2010 to $100 million in a 
mere 3 and one-half years with only $17.6 million in ven-
ture capital. But in 2015, Fiksu hit the wall. As that year 
dawned, Fiksu was planning to double staff to 500 and 
go public. Yet by April 2015 it had called off its IPO and 
announced plans to fire 10% of its staff. By September 
2015, it had dismissed 25 more people. Intense price com-
petition from better-funded rivals slammed the brakes on 
Fiksu’s growth. Micah Adler, Fiksu’s MIT-educated CEO, 
hoped to revive the company’s growth by applying its 
algorithm-development skills to a new market – analyzing 
consumer data to help advertisers target more effectively. 
However, by March 2016, Fiksu was quietly folded into 
another company—a disappointing result for its investors. 
Adler said, “Eighty-five cents of every new online adver-
tising dollar goes to Google and Facebook. It’s harder and 
harder for small companies to compete.”
• 
Amazon (big, growing). Seattle-based Amazon is a $100 
billion e-commerce and cloud service provider that con-
tinues to grow at over 20% annually—despite earning 
barely perceptible profits. Since it needs to add over $20 
billion in revenues to sustain that pace, Amazon’s CEO 
Jeff Bezos faces a huge challenge in sustaining that growth. 
Can he invest in the right blend of new services, new capa-
bilities, and new geographies to sustain that 20% growth?
• 
Apple (big, declining). Apple used to be the world’s largest 
company as measured by stock market capitalization—
but Alphabet (Google’s parent) took over that spot for 
a few weeks in February 2016. And that’s because Apple 
has not been able to come up with a new product—on 
the order of the iPod, iPhone, or iPad—that took sig-
nificant market share from large, established markets like 
MP3 players, cell phones, and tablets, respectively. With 
Apple becoming dangerously dependent on a slowing 
market—selling iPhones in China—can it invent a new 
product that will accelerate its revenue growth?
What Is a Growth Opportunity?
There are plenty of huge markets in the world—for example, there are over 
$1 trillion worth of student loans—but market size alone does not mean it’s a 
growth opportunity for your company. If the market is big and getting smaller, 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
5
you may want to avoid it. If there is intense price competition in a market, 
there may be very little profit available for your company. And even if there is 
high profit potential in the market, it will mean little to your company if you 
lack or cannot create the skills needed to gain a significant share of that mar-
ket. Moreover, even if the market is attractive and you have or can obtain the 
skills needed to take share, does the risk-adjusted return required to compete 
in that market justify the investment?
When considering growth opportunities, you should brainstorm without  
constraint. But before committing resources, rank the ideas based on the following 
definition: a growth opportunity exists for your company if it passes four tests:
• 
It relieves human pain—there is a chance to put a smile 
on the faces of unhappy people.
• 
There’s a big market—many such people in pain will pay 
for a product to make them happy. For a start-up, a big 
market would be $1 billion—but to be attractive to a 
large company, a market would have to be correspond-
ingly larger.
• 
You have the right capabilities—your company can design, 
build, distribute, and service the product. Or, as we will 
explore in the case of Netflix, it can create the right 
capabilities.
• 
You have an advantage—you are ahead of current and 
potential rivals in the race to make those people happy.
Anticipate Expiration of Current Growth 
Opportunities and Invest in New Ones
Moreover, in considering growth opportunities, decision makers must remem-
ber that they expand and contract over time. Every industry goes through life 
cycles—starting with slow initial acceptance, followed by very rapid growth, 
maturity, and decline. Some industries—for example, semiconductors—go 
through these cycles much faster than others—such as railroad cars. However, 
thanks to the way technological innovation has spread to more industries 
over the last several decades, no company is immune from the threat that its 
success surfing one technological wave will make it very difficult for the com-
pany to sustain that success in subsequent waves. As illustrated in Figure 1-2, 
leaders should think of their industry as a series of S-curves that will emerge 
as technology makes possible huge increases in customer value—what I call a 
Quantum Value Leap (QVL).

Chapter 1 | Introduction
6
A QVL gives customers a reason to take the risk of switching to a new product 
from the one they are using now. Those risks can be considerable—especially 
if a business has changed its operations to use a supplier’s current product. 
For example, in order to use so-called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
software, companies needed to pay millions of dollars to suppliers like SAP to 
license the software, millions more to a consulting firm to install it, and devote 
countless hours to training employees on how to change the way they oper-
ate in order to take advantage of the ERP system. Such a company would be 
unwilling to switch to a new ERP supplier unless it was obvious that the new 
technology would provide so much of a boost to its profits that it would be 
worthwhile to incur the costs of buying and installing the new product and 
taking the risk that it might not work properly.
Such a new technology would have to occupy the starting point of a new 
S-Curve. And the question for incumbent suppliers is whether they can envi-
sion that new S-Curve and supply it, or whether they would prefer to focus 
on milking the cash from the maturing one from which it derives the bulk of 
its revenue. For its part, SAP saw that companies like Salesforce were gaining 
market share from rivals such as Seibel by building a new S-Curve that would 
enable companies to rent continuously updated software that operated on 
outsourced hardware for a lower monthly fee.
Moreover, Salesforce changed the risk profile of corporate software purchas-
ing. An IT executive who bought Seibel’s product would pay millions of dol-
lars and wait three years before the product’s success or failure was clear. By 
that time, a sales manager could be out of a job. By contrast, Salesforce sold

its service directly to sales managers who would need to wait only a few 
months before it was clear that it worked—a much less risky decision for 
sales managers.
By January 2016, SAP had implemented its own product on the Software as a 
Service (SaaS) S-Curve. And that product—S/4 HANA—promised to reduce by 
40% the amount of computing power companies needed to employ, according 
to SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner. The success of S/4 HANA was so great that it 
accounted for 75% of SAP’s cloud revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015—
three quarters after it was introduced. One such customer, Airbus said at a June 
2015 SAP customer meeting in France that it had sped up “reporting perfor-
mance five-fold and data load time four-fold” after replacing its Oracle product 
with SAP HANA. While SAP did not lead the charge to the SaaS S-Curve, it did 
follow fast enough to gain a meaningful share of its growth phase.
Executives must know where they are on the current S-Curve and which 
technology will propel the next one. And they must develop the strategic 
discipline needed to use the profit generated by the current S-Curve to invest 
in the capabilities needed to tap the growth opportunities from the next one. 
The key to successfully making the transition from one S-Curve to the next 
is to do the opposite of what Clayton Christensen recommended in his book, 
The Innovator’s Dilemma. Rather than housing the new technology in a separate 
subsidiary charged with killing the parent as he recommends, the CEO should 
manage the transition to the new S-Curve within the company. As described 
below, a case in point is Netflix’s transition from a DVD-by-Mail service to an 
online streaming supplier.
Three Myths of Corporate Growth
While boosting growth is an imperative for all CEOs, achieving that end is 
made more difficult because decision makers are blinded by three powerful 
myths—drawn from Grow to be Great coauthored by Babson College senior 
lecturer Dwight Gertz. Ultimately, these myths are manifestations of confir-
mation bias—the notion that people seek out information that confirms what 
they believe and disregard information that challenges those beliefs.
Big Companies Can’t Grow
Conventional wisdom is that start-ups sprint and big companies plod. To be 
sure, there is no comprehensive data on the growth rates of start-ups since 
they are privately held. Moreover, the ones that say that they are growing are 
much more eager to highlight their skyrocketing percentage growth rates, 
which often mask how small their revenues were and still are. While there 
are plenty of big companies that grow very slowly, there is much to learn by 
comparing big companies that are growing faster than 20% a year with peers 
whose growth is stagnant.

Table 1-1 provides a few illustrations of fast-growing big companies and their 
slower growing peers.
My Industry Is Not Growing, So Neither Can Our 
Company
In almost every industry, some participants are growing much faster than the 
average company. Yet some CEOs believe that it is unreasonable for investors 
to expect their companies to grow faster than their industries—especially 
if they are large participants. Nevertheless, in many large industries that are 
growing relatively slowly, there are frequently significant companies that are 
growing faster—in some cases many times more rapidly than their peers.
Table 1-2 provides eight illustrations of large, slowly growing industries that 
host major companies growing many times faster than the average participant.

The Only Way We Can Grow Is through Acquisition
Big company growth can come from many sources—products developed 
internally, partnerships, and acquisitions. Gertz and Baptista analyzed a sample 
of profitably growing companies and found that 61% of revenue growth was 
generated internally while only 39% of the growth was attributed to acquisi-
tions. And while acquisitions usually fail, the ones that succeed do so because 
the acquiring company and the target need each other’s capabilities to suc-
ceed. For example, during the 1990s, Cisco Systems regularly made over 60 
acquisitions a year, and its most successful acquisitions were able to tap its 
powerful corporate sales force to turn an acquired company’s technology into 
a $2 billion a year product.
Growth Comes from Five Dimensions
If you’d like your company to grow faster, what should you do? Follow a stra-
tegic growth discipline. And that discipline starts with a systematic approach 
to brainstorming, ranking, choosing, and investing in growth opportunities. 
Companies can find growth along five dimensions, ranging from the most basic 
to the most challenging. As depicted in Figure 1-3, these dimensions can either 
be the same as those in a company’s existing practices, or reflect new and dif-
ferent parameters.

Let’s look at examples of how companies have tapped these dimensions for 
growth, summarize the key insights from these cases, and recommend how 
leaders can apply them.
Customers: Same or Different
If you're already selling a product now, you may be able to grow faster by 
selling new products to your existing customers. Or faster growth may come 
from selling your current products to a new group of customers. To evaluate 
this decision, it helps to have a map of your customers. And the nature of that 
map varies depending on whether you sell your product to individuals or 
organizations. For example, if individuals buy your product now, you should 
try to identify whether most of those customers share common attributes 
such as the following:

Political leanings
Consumers who share common attributes are market segments. If organiza-
tions buy your product, you ought to be able to segment your customer base 
by seeing how they cluster among a different set of attributes such as the 
following:
• 
Number of employees
• 
Industry
• 
Geography
• 
Attitude toward technology
• 
Financial condition
Can you take a bigger share of your current market or should growth flow 
from a new group of customers? One start-up is seeking growth by winning 
more business from its current customers. I invested in SoFi, a consumer lender 
based in San Francisco, which uses a unique marketing strategy to grow fast—
from $168 million worth of loans in 2013 to $7 billion by January 2016. What 
makes SoFi different from a bank is that it picks customers who are graduates 
of top schools like Stanford and Harvard. Such customers tend to have better 
loan repayment rates and are more likely to have successful careers that make 
them lucrative financial services customers throughout their lives.
SoFi holds parties for its customers in cities around the United States. Such 
parties encourage its customers—millennials who graduated from top 
schools—to build relationships with each other and to bring in potential cus-
tomers from among their peers. The company seeks to turn this cohort into 
lifelong customers by making them “feel as if they belong to an exclusive club,” 
according to Bloomberg. As CEO Mike Cagney said, “We can do some things 
that really get you to start to rethink how your relationship with a financial 
services firm should work. We’re trying to make these guys dinosaurs. And 
hopefully I’m the meteor by which they all die.” While SoFi had made $7 bil-
lion worth of loans by January 2016—it had only won a tiny share of the $3.5 
trillion (December 2015) market for consumer installment loans.
Thinking about segments should lead executives to ask questions such as:
• 
In which segments are the 20% of my customers that 
account for 80% of our revenues?
• 
Which segments do the other customers that account 
for the remaining 20% of our revenues occupy?

Chapter 1 | Introduction
12
• 
Are our most important segments saturated?
• 
If so, are there less saturated segments that would be 
eager to purchase our current products?
• 
If not, how can we boost our share of the less saturated 
segments?
To decide whether your company has a chance to accelerate its growth from 
current or new customers, address these questions by taking six steps:
• 
Segment your current customers.
• 
Identify how much of your revenue comes from each 
segment:
• 
Analyze the broad trends—such as evolving 
customer needs, changing economic conditions, or 
new technology—that might boost (or contract) 
growth in these segments.
• 
Estimate your company’s share of the most important 
segments:
• 
For saturated segments, identify new segments that 
would be interested in buying your product and 
interview potential customers in those segments to 
gauge their level of interest.
• 
For unsaturated segments, determine the most effective 
marketing strategies for achieving further penetration.
• 
Assess the cost, fit with your company’s skills, and time to 
market of the options.
• 
Pick the option with the lowest cost, best fit, and quickest 
time to market.
Geography: Same or Different
If your company’s product is selling well in the markets where you currently 
operate, consider whether future growth could come from the locations 
where you currently operate—or by expanding your company’s geographic 
scope. If you have a small share of your current geographic market, more 
share of that market could be no further away than boosting your marketing 
budget, adding more distribution partners, and/or hiring more salespeople.
Sometimes growth can come from taking your show on the road. When 
Starbucks decided to open coffee shops in China in 1999, it did so in the face 
of naysayers who assumed that with its thousands of years of tea-drinking cul-
ture, the Chinese would be the last people to drink coffee. But 16 years after 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
13
entering the Chinese market, Starbucks operated 2,000 stores in 100 Chinese 
cities. Moreover, Starbucks anticipated adding 1,400 more such coffee shops 
by 2019—including 500 alone in the current year. Starbucks carefully studied 
the market and saw an opportunity to “introduce a Western coffee experi-
ence, where people could meet with their friends while drinking their favorite 
beverages,” according to Forbes.
Starbucks decided not to threaten China’s tea-drinking culture through adver-
tising and promotion. Instead it selected “high-visibility and high-traffic loca-
tions to project its brand image,” noted Forbes. Starbucks introduced drinks 
that included local ingredients such as green tea and made young Chinese feel 
“cool and trendy” through what Forbes noted was its stores’ “chic interior, 
comfortable lounge chairs, and upbeat music.” Starbucks also used its best 
baristas as brand ambassadors to China—they trained its Chinese employees 
and helped establish the company’s culture there.
Here are five steps to get you started on sourcing growth from new countries:
• 
List four countries that best match with your current 
markets.
• 
Identify how your product can boost the profits of your 
distribution partners in those countries.
• 
Ask potential end users of your product to rank the cri-
teria—for example, price, quality, service —they use to 
compare suppliers.
• 
Analyze how well your company does on these criteria 
relative to competitors.
• 
Position your product to outperform competitors on the 
ranked criteria.
Products: Same or Different
One of the most basic sources of growth is to sell new products to your exist-
ing customers. The new product can come from acquisition, partnership, or 
your own product developers. As Northwestern University Kellogg School of 
Management Professor Mohanbir Sawhney, explained, not all growth is good. 
Bad growth—such as that caused by subprime lending or acquisitions that add 
needlessly to a company’s complexity—produces short-term revenue growth 
but longer-term collapse. Good growth, says Sawhney, is organic—from 
“increased share of [a customer's] wallet, stealing share from competitors, or 
increasing the size of the market [and maintaining your share].” A case in point 
is Reliance Jio Infocomm, an insurance claims management firm on whose 
board he serves. The company gained a bigger share of wallet by adding new 
services beyond claims management—such as policy administration, under-
writing, paying claims, and terminating policies—which its customers wanted.

Chapter 1 | Introduction

If you decide that selling the same product to new customers is the way to go, 
which new customers should you pick? They might be people who have the 
same pain as your existing customers—say people in New York—who you have 
not yet tried to contact—for example, Connecticut residents. If you decide 
that the best growth path may be from selling new products to your current 
customers, here are four steps that will help you build the right product:
• 
Ask your customers to tell you their goals and the biggest 
barriers to achieving them.
• 
Brainstorm new product ideas that would help your cus-
tomers leap over these barriers.
• 
Build a prototype of the best ideas and get customer 
feedback.
• 
Turn the most promising ideas into your next product.
If you find it might be faster or better to acquire a company that makes the 
new product, follow these seven steps:
• 
Observe the most pressing external and internal chal-
lenges facing your current customers and whether they 
are buying new products or services to help address 
those problems.
• 
Identify a list of companies who provide that product or 
service.
• 
Determine whether that new market would be sufficiently 
large and profitable to warrant further examination.
• 
Assess the capabilities needed to gain a significant share 
of that market.
• 
Evaluate whether a merger with one of those companies 
could yield a competitor with stronger capabilities.
• 
Investigate how difficult it would be to integrate the can-
didates’ companies into yours.
• 
Estimate the investment required to acquire the best can-
didate and its net present value.
Capabilities: Same or Different
Capabilities are business activities—such as new product development, supply 
chain management, selling, marketing, and service—that help a company to 
win and sustain long-term customer relationships. When a company intro-
duces its first successful product, it usually builds up the capabilities it needs 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
15
to meet customer demand as the S-Curve shifts from initial adoption through 
to maturity and decline. If the company is fortunate, the skills that it develops 
for the first product will help the company to introduce future products.
This is what Apple was able to do for three products in a row. Under Steve 
Jobs, Apple was great at product design, marketing, supply chain (led by current 
Apple CEO, Tim Cook), and building content ecosystems. It first applied those 
skills to building a better MP3 player—the iPod. Apple first designed a much 
more satisfying piece of hardware. It also overcame objections to breaking 
albums into singles by citing the lost revenue from peer-to-peer sharing net-
works like Napster. As a result, Apple negotiated a deal with producers to make 
available to consumers a wide selection of music and other audio products. In 
January 2001, Apple launched this content ecosystem dubbed iTunes that made 
people want to buy the iPod when it was introduced that October. Moreover, 
Apple built a supply chain—mostly centered on Foxconn, which could man-
ufacture and ship the product to Apple’s retail stores. And Apple applied its 
advertising and marketing skills to ignite people’s desire to buy the product.
With some modifications, Apple applied the same set of skills to build its version 
of a cell phone—the iPhone—and a tablet, the iPad. To make the iPhone com-
pelling, Apple created a content ecosystem—the App Store—that offered eco-
nomic incentives for developers. Moreover, Apple persuaded AT&T to be the 
first telecommunications carrier to support the iPhone—another manifestation 
of Apple’s partnering capability. Since it introduced the iPad in 2010, the question 
for Apple is whether that same set of capabilities can enable the company to 
capture a new growth opportunity to replace the profit that will be lost as the 
iPhone matures. Perhaps Apple’s capabilities are less useful now that Steve Jobs 
is no longer its CEO. And that could mean Apple needs a new CEO or needs to 
create new capabilities in order to capture new growth opportunities.
Netflix has not enjoyed the luxury of being able to rely on its capabilities 
for three products in a row. Instead, Netflix added new capabilities in order 
to shift from DVD-by-Mail to online streaming. Investors approve—its stock 
price more than tripled in the five years ending January 2016. DVD-by-Mail 
depended on such capabilities as the wholesale purchasing of a wide variety of 
DVDs, as well as building and operating a system to track customer orders and 
route delivery and pickup of DVDs between Netflix and customers’ mailboxes.
When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings real-
ized that DVD-by-Mail would go the way of the Dodo—and soon people 
would demand to watch videos on their smartphones. Hastings also real-
ized that Netflix would encounter an insurmountable challenge—obtaining 
early access to movies and TV programs produced by others. So rather than 
depend on suppliers who viewed it as a rival, Netflix produced its own con-
tent. While creating that capability was a huge challenge, the popularity of 
shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black suggests that Netflix 
succeeded. Hastings bet over $100 million—ordering 26 episodes of House of 
Cards (based on a BBC original that came up for auction in 2012).

Chapter 1 | Introduction
16
This bet flowed from Netflix’s 2012 analysis of the habits and preferences of its 
29 million subscribers. Hastings concluded that Netflix would be able to recoup 
its House of Cards investment because so many of its subscribers watched Kevin 
Spacey and David Fincher movies and political thrillers. But along with the bet 
on producing its own content would come a phasing out of capabilities on 
which it depended to operate its DVD-by-Mail business—such as wholesale 
purchasing of DVDs and operating a network to pick up and deliver those 
DVDs to customers’ mailboxes. While phasing out those activities, Netflix 
needed to add another new one—the ability to partner with a complex array 
of broadband service providers. Given that its consumers consume as much 
as 37% of all bandwidth during peak streaming hours, such partnerships are 
essential for Netflix’s ability to operate its online streaming service.
If you see such a growth opportunity, here are four steps to make this work 
for your company:
• 
List the skills needed to succeed in the new market.
• 
Assess the fit between those skills and the ones at which 
your firm excels.
• 
Develop a plan to hire or partner to get the skills you'll 
need.
• 
Manage the process of changing your company's skills.
On the other hand, if you are looking for new markets where your skills 
would enable you to take market share, do the following:
• 
Make a list of skills at which your company excels.
• 
Look at big markets where those skills could yield a bet-
ter product.
• 
Build a prototype of that product and get feedback from 
potential customers.
• 
Estimate the time and cost needed to bring that product 
to market.
Culture: Same or Different
In some companies—think Apple under Steve Jobs—the CEO was the source 
of new product ideas. That works well until the CEO stops coming up with good 
ideas or leaves the company. To supplement the CEO’s creativity, other com-
panies encourage all employees to come up with growth ideas. For example, 
3M is famous for letting employees spend 15% of their time on projects that 
interest them—that's how the Post-It Note was born (it solved an employee’s 
problem with bookmarks falling out of his church hymnal). 3M encourages its 
people to come up with new ideas and pressures its divisions to derive 30% of 
their revenues from products introduced in the last three years.

17
Can you change your culture to encourage your employees to create more 
growth opportunities? Intuit, the maker of accounting software such as 
TurboTax and Quicken, created an idea collaboration portal that lets employ-
ees post ideas, get feedback, coaching and suggestions—and even sign up 
people to help implement these. And the beauty of this portal is that all this 
idea generation can happen without a manager getting involved. According 
to Intuit’s founder, Scott Cook, by 2012 this portal had turned 30 ideas into 
“shipping products and features” that boosted Intuit’s revenues. Cook, who 
joined Bain & Co. after earning his Harvard MBA, described his passion for 
assuring that Intuit was capable of both strengthening its core business and 
creating innovative new ones. His key finding was that big companies must 
create a culture of frugal experimentation.
This was a problem that Cook began studying in 2008. He believed that there 
was no market category that kept growing for so long that an incumbent 
company could avoid eventually perishing unless it hitched its wagon to a new 
market. As an example, Cook cited Microsoft that “has been unable to invent 
successful new disruptive businesses—causing its growth to slow down.” 
Cook found it strange that large successful companies could not invent new 
industries. After all, he reasoned, they had the best people, a high profit flow, 
the largest customer base, and the broadest channels of distribution. And yet, 
Cook noted, if you look at enterprise and consumer technology companies, 
the game-changing innovations almost never come from the big incumbents 
such as Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft. With the exception of Apple in the 2000s, 
all the big innovations came from start-ups.
Cook decided to investigate whether there were any large companies that 
have been able to buck this trend. Cook studied companies such as Hewlett 
Packard, 3M, Procter & Gamble—where he worked, and Toyota Motor. He 
found that the common thread during the periods of their most successful 
product and process innovations was the systems they put in place to encour-
age employees to conduct frugal experiments.
Cook did not see himself as being a product champion like Jobs or Amazon 
founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Instead, he strived to create a company that would 
be able to continue to create new growth businesses long after he had left 
Intuit. Intuit invented new businesses by creating an environment that encour-
aged people there to come up with new business hypotheses and test them 
against feedback from customers. One example was a debit card for people 
without bank accounts. An Intuit finance employee—not a “product person”—
noticed that the people who need tax refund checks the most are often ones 
who don’t even have bank accounts. She came up with the idea of giving those 
people debit cards: Intuit would accept the tax refunds into its accounts and 
transfer the funds to the debit card. She thought of the idea in February and 
wanted to test it by April 1, before tax season ran out on April 15.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
18
CEO Cook criticized the kludgy web site she developed, but the employee 
argued that it was better to get something crude that would test her idea 
than to wait another 10 months. She expected 100 takers but got 1,000. And 
the surprise was that half of those who wanted the debit card already had 
bank accounts. In this way, Intuit discovered that the need for this product was 
much greater than it had reckoned. One interesting feature of this story is 
that Cook was not wild about the web site that the employee had developed 
but she was able to pursue her idea anyway. This echoes one of Cook’s find-
ings when he studied Hewlett Packard.
His conversation with the author of a 650-page book on its history revealed 
that seven of the eight big new businesses that HP invented came “from the 
bottom” and were opposed by CEO David Packard. The pattern Cook has 
found is that in all these cases, three things were true:
• 
The company “liberated the inventive power of new 
people.”
• 
It created a “culture of experimentation.”
• 
It changed the role of the boss from a decider of whether 
to pursue or cancel innovation projects to an installer of 
systems that encourage endless cycles of hypothesis gen-
eration, testing with customers, and learning from the gap 
between quantitative expectations and measured market 
truth.
Cook believed that there was nothing more rewarding to employees than to 
see their idea being used by people. To that end, Intuit created an idea collabo-
ration portal that let employees post ideas, get feedback, coaching, and sugges-
tions—and even sign up people to help implement it. And the beauty of this 
portal was that all this idea encouragement could happen without a manager 
getting involved. According to Cook, by 2012 this portal had turned 30 ideas 
into “shipping products and features” that boosted Intuit’s revenues. Cook’s 
system sounds eminently doable at big companies around the world—if their 
executives are willing to adopt it. Here are Cook’s eight steps for creating a 
culture of innovation:
• 
Leader’s vision. A culture of experimentation starts with 
the CEO’s vision. In Cook’s case, the vision is to change 
peoples’ financial lives so profoundly that they can’t imag-
ine going back to the old way.
• 
Strategy-by-experiment. Rather than trying to curry favor 
with their bosses, Cook believes it’s essential to enable 
people to make data-based decisions. This means encour-
aging them to conduct experiments and collect data on 
customer behavior.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
19
• 
Leap of faith assumptions. Cook encourages people to 
identify the two or three key assumptions that have to 
be true for the idea to succeed but might not be. Then 
people must find a way to test those assumptions with 
customers at a low cost in a very short time frame.
• 
Numeric hypothesis. Next Cook wants people to come 
up with an estimate of, say, the number of customers that 
will order the new product.
• 
Experimental run. The employee should then run the 
experiment to test whether that numeric hypothesis is 
right or not.
• 
Analysis of variance. Then Cook wants people to analyze 
the gap between the hypothesis and the actual results and 
dig deep to find the reason for that gap.
• 
Surprise celebration. Cook is adamant that people should 
not try to bury surprises to keep from being embarrassed 
but to savor them because they expose a market signal 
that has not yet been detected.
• 
Decision. Finally, people should make a decision about 
whether to pursue the idea or pivot.
Thus success of this process depends on a blend of confidence in a new idea 
coupled with intellectual humility when it comes to testing and refining it. 
Cook believes that one of his roles is to model this behavior so it will perme-
ate Intuit. If you choose to follow in Intuit’s path, you may need to create a 
new culture to encourage all your people to come up with growth ideas. Here 
are four steps you can use to create such a culture:
• 
Make a list of your values—one of which should be cus-
tomer innovation.
• 
Use a hiring process that favors people who share those 
values.
• 
Give employees time to brainstorm new products that 
will make customers better off.
• 
Provide resources to commercialize the best products 
and reward those who succeed—as well as the noble 
failures.

Summary
In a slowly growing world, there are two kinds of leaders—the innovators and 
the loungers. Investors and talented employees flock to the fast-growing companies 
and leave the rest. Read on to learn how you can use the five dimensions of 
growth to be the leader who wins those rewards for your company.

Growth via 
New or Current 
Customers
The most obvious place for many companies to look for growth is to sell 
more to the customers who have already bought their products. The problem 
with trying to sell more to people who already buy your product is that they 
might turn you down for several reasons:
• 
They are unhappy with your company’s product or its cus-
tomer service. If this is the reason, you should find out why 
and improve fast.
• 
Your product is working fine for the time being and they do not 
need to buy anything now. In this case, you should explore 
whether you can grow by selling the customer a product 
that satisfies a need related to your initial product or 
by finding more people like your current customers who 
will buy your current product.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
24
• 
A competitor has offered your customer a better value—for 
example, better performance and/or a lower price for compa-
rable performance—and the customer will swap your prod-
uct for the competitor’s. In this case, you might consider 
whether you can offer your customer a better value than 
your rival—or acquire the rival.
But if your current customers are happy, the growth path of least resistance is 
selling your current product to people who have not yet purchased it.
Defining Customer Groups
To find these customers, executives ought to think about market segments—
groups of customers that share common traits. As we saw in Chapter 1, these 
common traits vary depending on many factors. However, it helps to start by 
grouping business customers and consumers. Companies I’ve interviewed and 
advised as a consultant tend to group business customers along the following 
dimensions:
• 
Industry. Many information technology (IT) companies 
tend to focus their initial sales efforts on banks and insur-
ance companies. Such companies often find it easiest 
to grow by selling to potential customers in the same 
industry.
• 
Size. Many companies distinguish between selling to the 
largest, say, 1,000 companies ranked by revenues from 
selling to so-called small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs). When IT upstarts challenge big rivals like IBM, 
they may initially find it easier to focus on selling to SMEs, 
which tend to buy from channel partners. In so doing, 
the upstarts may generate revenues more quickly than 
they would were they to compete against incumbents’ 
most well-compensated sales people—the ones who sell 
to the biggest companies.
• 
Appetite for risk. Within each industry, some compa-
nies like to be the first to try the latest technological 
innovation while most of them tend to be more conser-
vative—waiting for the so-called early-adopters to be the 
guinea pigs. Companies often listen to early-adopters to 
help inspire their development of new products.
• 
Price sensitivity. Some business customers always seek 
to purchase a product at the lowest possible price while 
others are willing to pay a price premium for better qual-
ity. A company should pick customers who represent the 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
25
best fit with its pricing strategy. Simply put, a company 
that sells its product at the lowest price should target the 
most price-sensitive customers and vice versa.
Consumers can be grouped—mostly along different dimensions than compa-
nies. These include:
• 
Age range. Consumers are often grouped based on 
generational differences. For example, Baby Boomers 
(those born between 1945 and 1975) and Millennials 
(born between 1983 and 1995). Such groups of consum-
ers may share common traits that can guide companies 
seeking to separate them from their money.
• 
Income. The last few decades have featured an increas-
ing flow of wealth to a narrow segment of society with 
many in the middle losing economic ground. Companies 
seeking to reach consumers in different income strata 
should recognize that their purchase decisions will be 
motivated by their position on attributes such as price 
sensitivity and status signaling.
• 
Product occasions of use. Consumers may find many 
uses for a company’s product. For example, while many 
consumers eat cold cereal for breakfast, others eat cereal 
during lunch or dinner times. If a cereal company were 
marketing its product based on the assumption that peo-
ple only consume its product in the morning, it could 
grow by encouraging those who eat cereal at other times 
of day to buy its product.
• 
Purchase process. Different consumers may buy a 
company’s product in many different ways. Some go to an 
online site to compare prices and user ratings and pick the 
one with the best ratings. Others walk into a retail store 
and purchase the first product they see. In many cases, 
companies can benefit by grouping potential customers 
based on differences in the way they make purchases.
• 
Appetite for risk. Like companies, some individuals like 
to be the first to try a new product. For example, when 
Apple first announced its Watch, I asked about 200 of my 
students whether they would purchase it. Of those, one 
or two said they would because they wanted their peers 
to know they had purchased it. Most of the students said 
they were skeptical that the Watch could offer benefits 
worth purchasing. Companies should target their new 
products to these consumer early-adopters.

Principles of Growth from Current or New 
Customers
To grow faster, companies must find unmet customer needs and satisfy those 
needs better than do rivals. Achieving that goal requires CEOs to be intellec-
tually humble—which means that they investigate with an open mind, rather 
than assuming that strategies that worked for them in the past will result in 
future success. Indeed intellectual humility when applied to identifying unmet 
customer needs and satisfying those needs more effectively than competitors 
do is essential whether a company is large or small.
For large companies seeking to achieve growth by selling to current customers, 
there is no more important principle than a willingness to listen with an open 
mind to what customers want and finding a way to overcome a company’s inter-
nal inertia in order to deliver a product that satisfies those unmet needs. Indeed 
for large companies, a long-tenured CEO or one who has spent her entire 
career at the company may be unable to recognize that customer needs have 
changed or may try to respond to those changes without making fundamental 
changes to the company’s product mix or operations. This theme is particularly 
pronounced in the cases we will explore that pair McDonald’s and Subway.
Large companies seeking growth by selling to new customers ought to seek 
insight into the unique needs of those new customers. While this sounds sim-
ple in concept, the insight gained may cause business leaders to recognize a gap 
between the needs of the new customers and the company’s ability to deliver 
a better solution to those unique needs. As we see in the cases of Criteo and 
Kodak in this chapter, if that new strategy endangers the way that the company 
has made money in the past, the company may choose to respond in a way that 
causes the company to lose market share. However, if the company delivers 
a new product that outperforms competing ones in the minds of those new 
customers, it will gain market share and boost its revenue growth rate.
These principles also apply to small companies. But given their more pre-
carious financial condition, small companies are more subject to the specific 
strengths and weaknesses of their CEOs. If a small company’s CEO has supe-
rior insight than rivals into how unmet customer needs are likely to evolve 
and how to satisfy them uniquely, then that small company has a much greater 
chance of getting large quite rapidly. Conversely, if a small company’s founders 
are weak in skills required to deliver a better product to satisfy customers’ 
unmet needs, they are likely to drive the company out of business without 
even realizing why. Ultimately growth from current or new customers is a 
result of winning a contest between the company and competitors to provide 
those customers with the best value in the industry.

Case Studies
By examining case studies that pair successful and unsuccessful efforts we 
can gain insight into how executives have tried to grapple with the issues we 
discuss in this chapter in mapping a growth strategy based on selling to new 
or existing customers.
In the remainder of this chapter, we examine case studies to illustrate four 
principles of growth through new products:
• 
Large companies seeking growth from current 
customers should monitor and adapt to changing cus-
tomer tastes.
• 
Large companies seeking growth from new  
customers should identify ranked customer purchase 
criteria in the new segment and deliver a competitively 
superior value proposition.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from current 
customers should pick customer groups with a high 
willingness to pay, deliver excellent service, and encour-
age them to recommend the company to members of 
their network.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from new cus-
tomers should conduct research to rank their purchase 
criteria, analyze competitor offerings, and deliver supe-
rior value.
■
■Principle One  Large companies seeking growth from current customers should monitor and 
adapt to changing customer tastes.
Compared to start-ups, big companies combine disadvantages and advantages 
when it comes to adapting to changing customer needs. A big company may 
have existing assets—such as a large and powerful distribution channel—
which it can use to get access to consumers. But it may simultaneously suffer 
from leadership that is locked into an old way of operating the company that 
keeps it from listening to customers and adapting to their changing needs.
In theory the easiest path for future growth should be winning more business 
from current customers. That’s because a well-run company would be reward-
ing its people for understanding its customers and anticipating their changing 
needs. However, in practice what makes the difference between success and 

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
28
failure in tapping growth from current customers is the CEO’s willingness to 
adapt to change. Companies whose CEOs have come up through the ranks 
often have difficulty changing the company to seize new growth opportunities. 
CEOs who come in from the outside may have good ideas but may struggle to 
get them implemented. And big company CEOs with the right blend of inter-
nal and external experience may be best positioned to envision and execute 
effective strategies for growth from current customers.
Successful: McDonald’s All-Day Breakfast
Introduction
Adapting to change quickly and effectively can be especially helpful for 
big companies seeking growth from current customers. A case in point is 
McDonalds, which introduced all-day breakfast in response to social media 
requests from its current customers within six months. By the fourth quarter 
of 2015, that change propelled its growth above 5%—more than double ana-
lysts’ expectations.
Case Scenario
In a 2015 bid to boost growth, McDonald’s sold a product it was already selling—but 
only in the morning—to a mixture of new and existing customers by answering their 
call for all-day breakfast.
In January 2016, McDonald’s beat Wall Street earnings expectations for the fourth quar-
ter of 2015—enjoying 5.7% same-store-sales growth in North America—well ahead of 
the 2.7% growth Wall Street had expected, leading to a 35% profit pop and propelling its 
stock to an all-time high after a two-year slump. How did it do so? McDonald’s USA Chief 
Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl said, “Customers were saying to us ‘Hey, McDonald’s, 
this is the next big thing. This is what we want from you. This idea came from our custom-
ers. We said this really is the people’s launch, that’s what this is all about.” As one analyst 
told CNBC, “I think the key takeaway with the all-day breakfast is the fact they were able 
to roll it out in a matter of six months. That wasn’t something we saw under previous 
leadership, and I think that bodes well for a lot of the new initiatives.”
Moreover, the initial success of all-day breakfast motivated McDonald’s to expand 
it. McDonald’s Corp. decided to go bigger with all-day breakfast. In a bid to main-
tain the hype—and the sales gains—the chain was planning to add McGriddles 
and more breakfast sandwiches to its all-hours menu. The change would take place 
across the United States in September 2016, almost a year after all-day breakfast 
was first introduced, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said in a statement. In 
July 2016, McDonald’s announced plans to expand its full-day breakfast menu to 
all U.S. locations and to offer three varieties of McGriddles—a sandwich that uses 
maple-flavored pancakes as buns—to its previous all-day breakfast menu consisting 
of English muffin- and biscuit-based sandwiches.

Yet this turnaround was so dramatic because McDonald’s had gotten locked in to a 
rigid approach to managing itself. And that approach probably seemed justified to 
experienced executives who had grown up inside its system based on its legendary 
success. Between 1948 and 2014, its emphasis on quick service and a standardized 
menu propelled it from a single store to more than 35,000 outlets across the world. 
But by July 2014, global sales began to decline due to problems around the world. 
For example, sales in China fell sharply after one of its suppliers was discovered in 
July 2014 to be using expired and contaminated chicken and beef. After that, several 
Japanese customers reported finding bits of plastic and even a tooth in their food.
In the United States, Burger King gained market share with a simpler and cheaper 
version of the McDonald’s menu. And “fast-casual” restaurants such as Shake Shack 
and Chipotle Mexican Grill were taking customers from McDonald’s with their slightly 
better quality food, a high level of customization (such as the option to choose the 
ingredients in a burrito or burger), and some table service. All these problems began 
to be solved when McDonald’s appointed Steve Easterbrook CEO in January 2015.
Dean DeBiase, Adjunct Lecturer of Innovation & Entrepreneurship at Northwestern 
University’s Kellogg School of Management taught in a part-time MBA program on 
corporate innovation that included an immersion program in which students devel-
oped new products for McDonald’s.
In this way, he had a chance to observe how Easterbrook had turned McDonald’s 
around. Easterbrook is a great leader for McDonald’s. “Steve has the outlook of a 
younger generation. He left and came back which gave him a global perspective 
and insights into how to succeed in smaller markets. He is a rugged individual-
ist who inspires people, holds them accountable, and gets things done,” explained 
DeBiase. Easterbrook also excels at driving changes that benefit all of the company’s 
stakeholders. “Steve is a smart operator who is using insights from social media to 
understand what consumers want and helping franchisees and employees to see 
why they will be better off if they get on board with the need to adapt to consumers’ 
changing tastes,” he said.
A case in point is the introduction of all-day breakfast, which contributed to 
McDonald’s big growth spurt in the first quarter. There was clear evidence for years 
that consumers were asking for the change. But Easterbrook was able to help fran-
chisees see that the resulting revenue growth would warrant the investment they’d 
have to make to change their supply chain, information technology, and employee 
training. One reason Easterbrook was able to make the case was that McDonald’s 
could try out the all-day breakfast in its test kitchens so it would be able to provide 
detailed answers to the questions franchisees had about how the change would 
affect their operations. Easterbrook used the forum of the regular franchisee meet-
ings to help get them on board with the change he wanted to make. “Steve used the 
meetings to encourage the franchisees to think openly about how their lives would 
change over the next decade,” according to DeBiase.

Case Analysis
Easterbrook’s example also offers four lessons for companies seeking to 
boost growth by selling to current customers.
	1.	 Listen to customers for inspiration on sources of growth.
	2.	 Test out your best growth ideas to iron out the kinks 
before introducing them.
	3.	 Craft your case for change to appeal to the interests of 
your company’s stakeholders—such as partners, custom-
ers, and employees.
	4.	 Inspire people to embrace the growth idea and hold them 
accountable for making it happen.
Unsuccessful: Subway Shrinks by Losing Touch
Introduction
Success can lead to failure—especially if the company in question is big and 
chooses to ignore up-start rivals that take its customers. That’s what Subway 
did. With 43,945 sandwich shops in 110 countries in 2015, Subway U.S. sales 
fell 3% in 2014 from the previous year’s $13.3 billion—faster than any other 
of America’s top 25 food chains, according to the Washington Post.
Case Scenario
Due to profit pressures, franchisees—who sold an average of $437,000 worth of 
subs, sodas, and cookies in 2015—were unable to adapt to competitive pressure by 
boosting ingredient quality and paying workers more to improve service. But more 
than any other lesson behind Subway’s decline is the high cost an organization pays 
when it trades off listening to changing customer needs and competitive pressures 
in favor of short-term profit goals. Perhaps one reason that Subway shrank is that 
decades of success produced a creeping belief that it could do no wrong. After all, 
Subway grew for decades by offering American consumers healthier alternatives at 
lower prices compared to the likes of McDonald’s and Burger King.
But by early 2015, Subway began to lose market share to rivals such as Chipotle 
Mexican Grill and Firehouse Subs that offered “fresher, healthier, build-your-own 
meals” than did Subway, noted the Post. These rivals redefined the meaning of 
healthy food—leading consumers to switch away from Subway. How so? While these 
rivals provide diners with fresh-cut meat heated by steamers, Subway continued peel-
ing the meat off wax paper and heating it in a microwave. In pursuit of fresh growth, 
Subway chose to keep doing what had made it successful in the past—opening new 
stores—rather than going a step further in redefining freshness beyond Chipotle

31
and Firehouse. As Darren Tristano, executive vice president of industry researcher 
Technomic, said, “Subway’s strategy has only been to open more stores, and ulti-
mately those stores just cannibalize each other.”
By 2016, Subway had been around for 51 years. In 1965, 17-year-old Fred DeLuca 
borrowed $1,000 from Peter Buck, a doctor, to open Pete’s Super Submarines in 
Bridgeport, Connecticutt. Things went slowly until 1974 when they changed the 
name to Subway. By 2013, Subway was opening 50 new shops a week—in hundreds 
of U.S. colleges, malls, and military bases. And Subway stepped up its growth ambi-
tions—seeking 30% growth in a year. In 2014, the then 66-year-old CEO DeLuca set 
a goal of adding 8,000 new American franchises to Subway’s existing 27,000. But 
while franchisees liked the relatively low upfront investment of $116,000—10% of 
McDonald’s, Franchise Grade, a franchisee polling and review service, ranked Subway 
number 468 in its 2015 report.
Prices of existing franchises were discounted to “the price of a car, as a sign that 
some owners wanted out. And as sandwich sales shrank, the pressure on franchisees 
increased,” according to the Post. And workers’ wages stayed low because franchi-
sees—who paid the Subway parent company a $15,000 start-up franchise fee plus 
12% of weekly sales—were under the gun to keep boosting profits as sales declined 
and the costs of keeping up with changing ingredients and menus rose. Subway’s 
reputation as a place to buy a healthier lunch had weakened. Technomic surveyed 
Americans who “found Subway’s food taste, flavor and visual appeal sagged” between 
2014 and 2015, according to the Post thanks to “intense competitive pressure from 
other sandwich concepts.”
Andrew Alvarez, a food analyst with IBISWorld concluded that Subways’ efforts to 
respond to its rivals—by adding items like hummus and a creamy sriracha sauce—
were insufficient. “We’re in a new environment—the Chipotle environment—with a 
new type of rhetoric, quality and marketability. Subway’s platform, its presentation 
almost looks primordial,” said Alvarez.
Subway’s strategy of boosting revenues by adding new stores and new menu items 
fell flat. In 2015, its sales declined 3.4% from the year before due to continued 
competitive pressure from Jimmy John’s, Jersey Mikes, and Firehouse Subs—some of 
whom saw sales soar as much as 30%. Moreover, Subway raised prices on its foot-
long subs from $5 to $6 without boosting perceived freshness or quality, which also 
caused customers to turn away.
Sadly, DeLuca was taken ill while visiting stores in 2013 and was discovered to be suf-
fering from leukemia from which he died in September 2015. Prior to his death, DeLuca 
appointed his sister, Suzanne Greco, as president to run Subway’s day-to-day operations.
Case Analysis
Subway’s declining revenues reveal three fatal flaws that companies should 
seek to avoid if they want to grow from selling more to customers in their 
current market segments.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
32
	1.	 CEO suffers from confirmation bias—the tendency to 
ignore information that does not reinforce the CEO’s 
mental model. In Subway’s case, the bias is that growth 
comes from aggressively selling more franchises.
	2.	 CEO ignores competitors who are redefining the indus-
try value proposition and taking away customers.
	3.	 CEO measures success through short-term profit 
goals—thus creating a doom loop when sales drop that 
requires cutting product quality and service, which leads 
to further sales declines.
The success of McDonald’s and the struggles of Subway reveal the importance 
of a basic insight that is very easy for big companies to forget—the customer 
is the boss. If a company wants to grow by selling to more customers within its 
core segments, it must listen to changes in customers’ needs and keep a close 
eye on what competitors are doing to satisfy those changing needs. Moreover, 
it is never enough merely to notice that customer needs are changing. Instead, an 
effective CEO must create a sense of urgency about the importance of taking 
effective action quickly to capture the growth opportunity. The McDonald’s 
case demonstrates what happens when these ideas are put into practice while 
the Subway story illustrates the perils of ignoring them.
■
■Principle Two  Large companies seeking growth from new customers should identify ranked 
customer purchase criteria in the new segment and deliver a competitively superior value proposition.
When a large company seeks growth from a new customer group, the most 
important mistake to avoid is assuming that the strategy that worked for your 
current customers will also work for the new ones. Avoiding that mistake 
depends on a company’s willingness to think about the new customer group 
as if it were starting the company from scratch—with the hope that some of 
the skills and resources that worked so far will help in the new venture. More 
specifically, targeting new customers will be most effective if the company 
deeply analyzes the specific needs of the new customers and examines how 
well customers perceive that the rivals meet those needs.
To do that, as we’ll see later in the chapter, companies should listen to poten-
tial customers describe and rank the factors—I call them customer purchase 
criteria—which they use to compare competing suppliers. Moreover, compa-
nies ought to heed what those potential customers say about why their win-
ning supplier outperforms rivals and whether there is a realistic opportunity 
for growth—where the company can satisfy customers’ unmet needs more 
effectively than rivals.

Successful: Criteo Penetrates the Middle Market
Introduction
A French mobile advertising service provider, Criteo, followed this path when 
it added so-called middle market companies to its initial big-company customer 
base. For example, in the second quarter of 2015, Criteo—which operates a 
system to let corporate clients boost sales by targeting consumers through 
desktop and mobile advertising——boosted its revenue excluding traffic 
acquisition costs (TAC) by 65% to $120 million as it added 730 mid-market 
customers to total about 8,500.
Case Scenario
Criteo expected more growth from these new customers. “Mid-market has been 
particularly strong this quarter both in contribution to our overall growth and net 
client additions. We expect we will see more and more new clients coming from the 
mid-market,” said CEO J. B. Rudelle. Indeed, Criteo fulfilled Rudelle’s commitment—
maintaining its rapid growth throughout 2015. Its revenues grew 60% to $1.3 billion 
and Criteo earned a 5% net margin—serving more than 10,000 clients while retain-
ing over 90% of them. Criteo grew quickly because of a fundamentally different way 
of grouping consumers, which led to a different set of product features that met the 
unique needs of these newly defined segments.
More specifically, instead of clustering consumers based on demographic variables 
like age or income, Criteo grouped them based on what they wanted to buy. “Instead 
of targeting people based on who they are (their age, gender, home address, marital 
status, etc.), we concentrate on what they want (a new phone, a sofa, a beach vaca-
tion, etc.),” explained Rudelle.
While this may seem obvious, recent developments in technology have made it pos-
sible. First, Criteo was able to “capture shopping intent” through search keywords, 
digital purchase history, online shopping carts, and other signals from consumers’ 
desktop and mobile devices. This enabled Criteo to predict what consumers would 
want to buy more accurately than in the past. Secondly, Criteo was able to provide 
its clients with real-time sales information by product that helped them to measure 
their return on marketing expenses. As Rudelle explained, “Thanks to break-through 
technologies, it’s now increasingly possible to make this link not only with precision 
for each consumer, but in real-time. This ability to close the loop allows for optimized 
media buying in a way that was only possible to dream of before.” Ultimately, Criteo’s 
growth comes from its ability to persuade clients that it can deliver a higher return 
on their marketing investment than do rivals.
As Eric Eichmann, president and COO of Criteo said, “From our perspective, we have 
8,500 clients-plus who are willing to work with us and we have a consumer database 
that connects [data] through us. There are not many people who have that installed 
base who could fuel that cross-device database, and we think this complements 

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
34
efforts by Google and Facebook. Measurability is absolutely key to our business,” 
Rudelle said. “We’re investing in our technology to show more performance. The best 
demonstration of this is mobile. We wanted to make sure we could measure ROI in 
mobile both in browser and in-app. We believe as advertising becomes more focused 
on performance and ROI, we will benefit.” Indeed Criteo was able to sustain its growth 
through the first quarter of 2016—posting a 36.4% increase in revenue—with 45% 
coming from existing clients and 55% from new ones—a total of 760 new clients.
Case Analysis
The Criteo case study reveals four critical lessons for executives seeking 
growth by selling to new customers:
• 
Pursue growth with an open mind. The CEO must 
be willing to assume that the needs of customers and the 
requirements for gaining market share will be different in 
the new market than they were for the company’s core 
business.
• 
Find customer’s pain. The company must listen to cus-
tomers in the new segment to identify the unmet needs 
that competitors may not be trying to address.
• 
Solve the problem in a way that will delight cus-
tomers. The company must have a vision for how tech-
nology can be used to address the unmet needs of these 
new customers in a way that will provide the customers 
with measurable benefits.
• 
Turn the vision into sales growth. The company must 
bet capital and product development resources on the 
vision, build the product, present it to customers, and 
close deals.
Unsuccessful: Eastman Kodak Files for Bankruptcy
Introduction
One of the biggest reasons that large companies fail to win customers in new 
markets is that their previous success installs organizational blinders on their 
top executives. These blinders lead executives to view anything new through 
a specific mental model that flowed from what made the firm successful in 
the past.
The longer the company has been successful with the same business strategy, 
the more effective those organizational blinders. That’s especially true if the 
company is located in a relatively remote area where the best way to enjoy 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
35
an economically comfortable life is to get a job at such a company and slowly 
rise through the ranks by following all the clearly articulated cues for achieving 
career success at the company.
The key point is that success can lead to failure because it molds a mental 
model that turns important market signals—such as changing customer needs, 
new technologies that create better value for customers, and the growing 
market power of new competitors—into information that must be ignored 
at the risk of being thrown off the corporate fast track.If one were to ask an 
individual employee whether such market signals demanded a response, he 
or she would probably say they did. But that employee would never admit it 
in a group discussion with colleagues for fear of being shunted away from the 
fast track. And this helps explain why Rochester, New York-based Eastman 
Kodak—for which I did a year’s worth of consulting work in the 1980s—filed 
for bankruptcy in 2012 because it could not offset the decline in traditional 
camera film sales by applying its silver-halide strategy—giving away a camera 
and film at low prices to make profit on developing prints—to build winning 
products for new customers in the digital imaging market.
Case Scenario
In 2011, I was amazed that Kodak had survived as long as it had. In the 1980s, my 
consulting work for the maker of the Brownie led me to believe that it was heading 
unstoppably to its end decades before—but it took longer than I had anticipated. 
When Kodak was founded in 1888, quality was its “fighting argument.” It gladly gave 
away cameras in exchange for getting people hooked on paying to have their photos 
developed—yielding Kodak a highly profitable annuity siphoned from its 80% share 
of the market for the chemicals and paper used to develop and print those pho-
tos. Inside Kodak, this was known as the “silver halide” strategy—named after the 
chemical compounds in its film. Kodak had a fantastic success formula that keyed off 
of international distribution, mass production to lower unit costs, R&D investment to 
introduce better products, and extensive advertising to make sure consumers knew 
about Kodak’s superior quality.
Unfortunately, competition came along and introduced ugly splotches all over this 
beautiful picture. Here are three examples:
• 
Instant photography. A few days prior to Thanksgiving in 
1948, a Massachusetts-based inventor, Edwin Land, offered 
consumers an instant camera that developed photos in 60 
seconds. Instant photography threatened Kodak’s profits from 
chemicals and film. Kodak responded by introducing its own 
instant photography products. Polaroid sued—alleging that 
between 1976 and 1986 Kodak stole its technology—asking 
for $12 billion in damages. In 1990, Polaroid won a mere $909 
million and ultimately filed for bankruptcy in October 2001.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
36
• 
Cut-rate film from Japan. In the 1980s, Japan’s Fuji 
started to sell rolls of film at a price way below the one that 
Kodak had been accustomed to charging. Fuji’s willingness to 
cut prices was quite popular with the rapidly growing mass 
merchandisers like Wal-Mart that preferred to deal with sup-
pliers who were willing to sell high volumes at ever-lower prices. 
And Fuji helped make consumers aware of its value by spon-
soring big events—such as the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. By 
1999, Fuji’s market share gains were so great that Kodak took 
a $1.2 billion charge along with 19,900 layoffs. Such layoffs 
persisted; for example, in January 2009, Kodak took a $350 
million charge to dismiss 3,500 employees after a 24% drop 
in revenue.
• 
Digital photography. Digital photography offered consum-
ers a better value but one that wiped out a decent way for 
Kodak to make money. After all, digital film—flash memory—
was a low margin proposition even if you had the huge semi-
conductor fabrication facilities needed to produce it. And even 
though Kodak was number two in digital cameras by 1999, it 
lost $60 on each one it sold. In one of many bids to replicate 
its Silver Halide business model in digital photography, Kodak 
offered a Photo CD film-based digital imaging product—but 
since it was priced at $500 per player and $20 per disc, it did 
not attract many customers.
Another reason that Kodak failed in the digital photography market is that its pri-
mary customer for traditional film was women and digital camera buyers were 
predominantly men. Kodak created demand for traditional cameras by advertising 
“the need to preserve significant occasions such as family events and vacations. 
These were labeled Kodak moments, a concept that became entrenched in everyday 
life,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Kodak’s ad campaigns assigned women 
the role of preserving these Kodak moments. “As responsible and caring wives and 
mothers—they were morally obliged to keep a meticulous record of their family’s 
history,” according to the Journal.
When digital came along, the primary users of cameras became men. And digital 
images could be viewed on camera, phone, or a PC without any need for hard prints. 
The eliminated the role Kodak had ascribed to women of keeping the family archives 
by maintaining hard copy prints of a family’s history. Men tended to take “transient” 
photographs and hence Kodak’s strengths at marketing to women became irrele-
vant. Rather than accept that it needed to change the focus of its marketing strategy, 
Kodak “kept trying to recreate the photography universe of yesteryear, one based 
around sentimental images taken by women at family reunions and vacations,” noted 
the Journal.

I had a personal encounter with another one of Kodak’s strategic blunders. In 
January 1988, I was standing next to a fax machine on the executive floor of Kodak’s 
Rochester, New York, headquarters. I watched in astonishment at a scrolling fax of 
a contract for Kodak to acquire Sterling Drug for $5.1 billion. Kodak thought this 
was a wise investment for two reasons: drugs had high margins and Kodak made 
chemicals. Unfortunately, those two facts were not sufficient to make this deal pay 
off for Kodak shareholders. To do that, Kodak would have needed capabilities that 
it lacked—such as the ability to come up with new, valuable, patented drugs or to 
make generic drugs at a rock-bottom cost. It only took six years for Kodak to realize 
that Sterling Drug was not a good fit for Kodak and sell it off in pieces.
One hope for returning to a decent business model might have been producing high 
quality personal printers for those digital images. Selling inkjet cartridges and papers 
might have yielded a nice profit stream for Kodak. But regrettably for Kodak, many 
other competitors—most notably Hewlett Packard had gotten there first. Since 
peaking in February 1999 at about $80 a share, Kodak shares suffered a steady 
tumble that wiped out 99% of their value—to 78 cents a share as of September 30, 
2011. At the end of June 2011, Kodak’s liabilities exceeded its assets by $1.4 billion. 
It then owed $1.4 billion and had $957 million in cash, down $847 million from 
the end of 2010. Its last CEO (since 2005), former Hewlett Packard executive Tony 
Perez, was unable to revive Kodak. In October 2011, it pulled $160 million from its 
credit line and hired restructuring advisor Jones Day even as Kodak denied that it 
was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy.
On January 19, 2012, the picture of Kodak’s demise was fully developed—that’s when 
it filed for bankruptcy. “As it watched digital dissolve its high-margin film business, 
Kodak had shed 47,000 employees since 2003, closing 13 factories that produced 
film, paper and chemicals, along with 130 photo laboratories,” wrote Bloomberg.
Case Analysis
Kodak’s bankruptcy reveals four fatal flaws that companies should seek to 
avoid if they want to grow from selling to new customers in their current 
market segments.
	1.	 Too much success—particularly leading a company to 
a dominant position in its industry with little competi-
tion—can create a rigid culture that cannot adapt to 
change.
	2.	 Rigid companies pick investments in growth opportuni-
ties that fit with what their top executives believe are the 
company’s timeless strengths. If the executives’ beliefs are 
not consistent with current and future marketplace reali-
ties, those investments are likely to consume resources 
that might have been allocated more effectively.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
38
	3.	 Developing new products without viewing them from the 
perspective of new customers is not likely to produce 
meaningful growth.
	4.	 Large companies are in danger of failing to understand 
the unique requirements of winning new customers and 
introducing products that deliver superior value.
Comparing the success of Criteo and Kodak’s failure reveal the importance 
of a basic insight when it comes to winning new customers. A large company 
is at risk of basing its growth strategy on internally important matters rather 
than what new customers demand. The Kodak case demonstrates that unless 
a company maintains what former Intel CEO Andrew Grove called “a healthy 
paranoia,” it is in danger of flushing away its resources in a profitless quest to 
build a future on the foundation of its long-irrelevant old ways of running its 
business. By contrast, Criteo’s success attracting middle-market customers 
reveals that its CEO maintained the right focus—on delivering a product that 
would offer new customers a competitively superior value proposition.
■
■Principle Three  Small companies seeking growth from current customers should pick customer 
groups with a high willingness to pay, deliver excellent service, and encourage them to recommend 
the company to members of their network.
Small companies have considerable advantages over big ones—the general 
rule for them is that they either grow or die. The Kodak case illustrates that 
big companies can die as well—but they have far more resources and can 
muddle along for decades as long as they don’t borrow too much money or 
burn through their cash. Small companies must find growth if they hope to 
survive. After all, many of them—particularly technology start-ups—tend to 
sacrifice profits and cash flow for very rapid growth. If the small companies 
achieve the aggressive growth goals that investors set, they can raise more 
money and keep growing until they ultimately go public or get acquired. This 
pressure to get big fast small companies to focus on how to capture growth 
opportunities before they run out of cash.
In contrast to large, resource-rich corporations, their resource scarcity 
heightens the intensity of small company CEOs’ efforts to craft and execute 
strategies to meet ambitious growth goals. To do this, small companies must 
do three things:
• 
Focus on the right customer groups—for example, ones 
with significant purchasing power and meaningful unmet 
needs.
• 
Co-develop products with early-adopter customers to 
satisfy those customers’ unmet needs.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
39
• 
Deliver new products that customers see as irresistibly 
superior to competing products.
If a small company has done this well, it is likely to have gained some market 
share. And one growth vector it can choose after that initial success is to seek 
to sell more of its current products to a larger share of the customer group it 
initially targeted. To do that well, small companies ought to turn their current 
customers into their best salespeople—by giving them products and support 
services that they perceive as excellent so they will enthusiastically recom-
mend them to others in their social network.
Successful: Social Finance (SoFi)
Introduction
Between its founding in 2011 and May 2016, SoFi, a San Francisco-based con-
sumer finance start-up in which I invested in December 2014, had made about 
$10 billion worth of loans. When I invested, SoFi was valued at $1 billion and 
by September 2015 it had raised an additional $1.4 billion in capital, valuing it 
at roughly $4 billion.
Case Scenario
SoFi’s profits came from charging investors loan-servicing fees and by selling loans 
to investors for more than it cost to make the loans. It also kept some loans and 
collected interest payments. SoFi offered below-market-rate student loan refinancing, 
mortgages, and other consumer loans using funds obtained from institutional inves-
tors and wealthy individuals to whom it paid as much as 6.5% annual interest—
depending on the borrower’s rate of loan repayment. Of SoFi’s 150,000 members, 
100,000 joined between June 2015 and June 2016 when it originated $600 million 
to $700 million in loans every month (compared to about $200 million per month 
in the first quarter of 2015).
The inspiration for SoFi could be an event that left a deep impression on its CEO, 
Mike Cagney, when he was 11 years old. That’s when he lived in Grosse Ile, Michigan, 
and his father lost his job as the manager of a steel-rolling plant. "We had to rely on 
a lot of community support during the two years he was looking for a job. The way 
people stood up and helped out, everything from our local banker to people bringing 
food, it left a lasting impact on me," he said. But SoFi — which has been profitable 
since 2014—has bigger ambitions. As Cagney told CNBC, “We actually are trying to 
change a fundamentally broken [banking] system.” And with the new capital, Cagney 
planned to expand through “initiatives in wealth management, banking account alter-
natives—things that allow us to give a holistic solution [that will lead] people to leave 
their existing banking relationship and just work with SoFi,” Cagney said.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
40
To understand its success, SoFi enjoyed five competitive advantages over traditional 
banks—such as Bank of America.
• 
Market segmentation. Traditional banks were highly 
regulated and could not cherry-pick the best borrowers and 
ignoring the rest. SoFi—which did not take deposits and 
was regulated at the state level by the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau—had more strategic flexibility. SoFi pros-
pered by targeting students at relatively selective schools—
such as Stanford and Harvard—whose alumni tended to get 
high-paying jobs and to be financially responsible. Moreover, 
SoFi’s original concept matched up wealthy alumni of those 
schools who in addition to providing the money to refinance 
those loans helped borrowers seeking career advice.
• 
Lower loan rates. SoFi estimated that it can save the typical 
student loan refinancing borrower about $14,000 and that its 
rates “started” at 3.50% fixed and variable rates start as low 
as 1.90% [annual percentage rate] APR (with AutoPay). Bank 
of America rival, Citizens Bank charged more—from 4.74% 
APR to 8.90% APR (with autopay) for fixed rate and 2.33% 
APR to 6.97% APR (with autopay) for a variable rate loan.
• 
Higher deposit rates. Like most traditional banks, Bank 
of America paid a barely detectable 0.03% interest rate to 
depositors—but it could go up as high as 0.08% for those 
with an account at its Merrill Lynch unit. SoFi did not take 
consumer deposits. However, individuals who qualified to pro-
vide cash to borrowers could earn much higher yields—up 
to 6.5% depending on the rate at which borrowers repay. To 
be sure, the people who provided capital to SoFi were tak-
ing a much bigger risk than a depositor at Bank of America. 
But with deposit rates near zero for the last eight years, SoFi 
offered a substantial reward to those willing to take that risk.
• 
Better customer experience. Bank of America was the 
second-largest U.S. lender but the leader when it came to 
customer dissatisfaction. According to an April 2015 J.D. Power 
survey of 80,000 bank customers on problem resolution, 
products, and fees, Bank of America ranked “last in four of 
11 regions in 2015 including the Northwest and Southeast, 
compared with two in 2014.” I could not find such a survey 
for SoFi, however, a comparison of SoFi’s loan application pro-
cess to Bank of America’s revealed one reason why consumers 
might like SoFi more. SoFi offered to give a potential borrower 
a rate on their loan within two minutes based on the bor-
rower’s response to questions asked on its web site. Bank of

41
America’s website let a potential borrower fill in an application 
but did not guarantee the time it would take to deliver the 
rate quote.
• 
More rapid response to change. Since I first wrote about 
SoFi in 2011, its business strategy evolved in response to mar-
ket feedback, changing technology, and upstart competitors. 
It started off in student loan refinancing. SoFi broadened its 
sources of capital from wealthy alumni to others—such as 
securitizing and selling the loans to institutional investors. Then 
it expanded into mortgages. In 2016, 60% of SoFi’s current 
loans were for student loan refinancing, but by the end of 
the year, new origination in mortgages and consumer loans 
[were expected to] top student debt refinancing, Cagney told 
Fortune.
SoFi planned to continue to adapt. As Cagney said, achieving his vision was “going to 
require us [to take] some chances. And those are things that are difficult to do as a 
public company, when you’re on a quarterly reporting calendar.” Having established 
itself with this initial strategy, SoFi pursued growth by seeking to gain a larger share 
of the well-educated borrowers it targeted initially. SoFi refered to its customers as 
members and it sponsored events that engaged those members with the company 
and with each other. Here are four ways SoFi does this:
• 
Sponsor social events. SoFi regularly invited members to 
gather for happy hours around the country. Cagney estimated 
that SoFi hosted two to three events per week, which in 2016 
included a yoga class in New York; a dinner party in Richmond, 
Virginia; and a skydiving trip in San Francisco.
• 
Help find a spouse. SoFi sponsored events for its single mem-
bers—for example, the skydiving outing held on Valentine’s 
Day 2016, was specifically for singles. SoFi was developing a 
dating app that expected to launch in 2016.
• 
Assist in starting a business. SoFi invited members to apply 
for its entrepreneur program, a six-month, full-time boot camp 
that connected founders to accredited investors and venture 
capitalists. SoFi let entrepreneurs defer loan payments during 
the program.
• 
Offer career counseling. SoFi employed career counselors 
who coached members seeking to switch fields or achieve pro-
fessional goals. The counselors also “led workshops on negoti-
ating raises and mastering informational interviews.”
“Once you have a relationship, no one is in a better position to deliver a second 
product than you are,” said Cagney. “If it’s based on trust and value and reciprocity, 
you should be able to scale that into a huge opportunity.” In the spring of 2016, SoFi 

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
42
faced a significant challenge when the CEO of one of its publicly traded rivals was 
fired—casting a dark shadow on the industry. In May 2016, Lending Club founder 
and CEO, “Renaud Laplanche was forced out after an internal investigation found 
that he had sold $22 million in loans to an institutional investor, despite knowing that 
the loans did not meet the investor’s ‘express’ criteria.”
In a bid to restore confidence, SoFi sold a very high quality $280 million bundle of 
loans to investors—holding 5% of the loans on its books. In May 2016, Moody’s 
“gave SoFi its first-ever triple-A debt rating [for that bundle], the highest available 
to a startup online lender.” That move proved insufficient to restore a major growth 
challenge for SoFi—in the first quarter of 2016, it originated a mere $1.85 billion 
worth of new loans—well short of its $2.4 billion goal. While SoFi was in better 
shape than its rivals—at the end of April 2016, asset manager Hartford Funds put 
the same value on its SoFi shares as it had in October. LendingClub shares fell 44% 
in the same period.
However, by July 2016, Cagney was considering a variety of options for SoFi’s growth 
strategy that were intended to shore up its need to raise capital for financing its 
loans:
• 
Becoming a Utah Bank. In March 2016, SoFi told Utah 
officials it would create 400 jobs and invest $8 million in the 
state. Cagney said that its Utah operations would handle bor-
rower phone calls but would also be useful if the company 
sought a bank charter in the state.
• 
Partnering with JP Morgan. In February 2016, Cagney 
met with J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon—in a meeting 
arranged by Arthur Levitt, a former Securities and Exchange 
Commission chairman who is an adviser to SoFi. Cagney and 
Dimon discussed their backgrounds and SoFi’s goals but both 
companies wanted to control the customer relationship and 
they had not announced a partnership as of July 2016.
These options were diametrically opposed to Cagney’s anti-bank rhetoric from earlier 
in SoFi’s history. But they demonstrated his willingness to adapt to rapidly changing 
business conditions in pursuit of SoFi’s long-term vision.
Case Analysis
The SoFi case study reveals five critical lessons for small company executives 
seeking growth by gaining share among their current customers:
• 
Participate in a huge market. SoFi’s initial market of 
student loans totals over $1 trillion and the other con-
sumer loans it offers also represent markets larger than 
$1 trillion.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
43
• 
Segment the customers. The key to SoFi’s initial 
success was its recognition that students could be seg-
mented by where they attended school. Moreover, SoFi 
realized that graduates of different schools had varying 
loan repayment rates.
• 
Offer a better value to the most attractive seg-
ment. SoFi recognized that it could offer lower interest 
rates to groups of students with the highest repayment 
rates—thus yielding a profitable portfolio of loans. 
Moreover, SoFi offered more responsive service to its 
customers than its rivals—large banks.
• 
Turn customers into enthusiastic product pro-
motors. SoFi dubs its customers members and creates 
opportunities for them to interact with other members 
and to develop their careers with the intent of selling 
them more services and encouraging them to bring their 
peers into the SoFi club.
• 
Adapt to rapid change. SoFi stumbled in the first 
quarter of 2016 as rivals suffered even more significant 
challenges. It is noteworthy that as of April 2016, the $4 
billion valuation at which it had raised capital in 2015 had 
held up. And SoFi was scrambling to develop new sources 
of funding to restore its rapid loan growth.
Unsuccessful: Homejoy
Introduction
A common prescription for start-up failure is to cut price to win customers 
and to focus so intently on getting new customers that you neglect current 
ones. This leads to a predictable doom loop. The customers that signed up 
with you because of the discount get terrible service so they are determined 
not to buy from you again. What’s more they will refuse to recommend your 
service to members of their social network. This bad treatment of customers 
is often accompanied by similar mistreatment of the employees who you hired 
to deliver the service. Your unhappy employees find ways of letting custom-
ers know that they don’t like the company. And employee turnover spikes. 
Now the firm is in a double-bind—it needs to spend more money to attract 
new customers and to hire enough people to serve the ones it has. Burning 
through cash, its executives realize that the company needs to raise more. But 
its underwhelming growth performance and prospects scare away potential 
investors. And the company shuts down.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
44
Case Scenario
This seems to be what happened to San Francisco-based home cleaning service 
Homejoy that opened in 2012 and shut down on July 31, 2015—wiping out $40 
million in investment. Homejoy targeted an estimated $400 billion global market by 
offering on-demand home-cleaning services. The company captured significant press 
attention “because it offered low-cost cleaning and was using software to automate 
the process of booking so it would be more efficient,” according to Business Insider.
Founded by Adora Cheung and her brother Aaron—both computer science majors, 
Homejoy did not grow as fast as its competitor Handy, and customers complained 
after Homejoy raised prices. Before shuttering, Homejoy raised $40 million from 
Y Combinator, PayPal founder Max Levchin, First Round Capital, Redpoint Ventures, 
and Google Ventures. It operated in 35 cities in the United States, France, the United 
Kingdom, Canada, and Germany and had 100 employees and roughly 1,000 clean-
ing professionals,” according to Re/code. Homejoy put most of the blame for its fail-
ure on four lawsuits it was fighting over whether its workers should be classified as 
employees or contractors—which Cheung said had made fundraising more difficult.
But perhaps Cheung was too uncomfortable to admit that Homejoy’s failure was due 
to mismanagement. Indeed the culprit for Homejoy’s collapse seems more likely to 
be “mounting losses, poor customer retention, a costly international expansion, run-of-
the-mill execution problems, technical glitches and the steady leak of its best workers 
to direct employment arrangements with its own (now former) clients,” according 
to Backchannel. Homejoy copied Handy’s customer acquisition strategy—offering 
Groupons to attract first-time customers. Despite internal data that customers who 
accepted the Groupons did not use the service again, by mid-2014, “thousands of 
people” accepted the $19.99 cleaning offers.
This strategy was costly for Homejoy. Indeed a third-party analysis of its financial 
statements revealed that roughly 25% of its customers kept using the service after 
the first month and fewer than 10% used it after six months. Homejoy was losing 
money every time it cleaned a home. Daniel Hung, Homejoy’s second full-time engi-
neer, told Backchanel, “The key problem is that we weren’t making enough money 
on our customers. We were spending a lot of money to acquire them, but not really 
retaining them.” Moreover, in pursuit of geographic expansion, Homejoy cut its stan-
dard prices dramatically to attract customers in dozens of new cities.
At its peak, Homejoy operated in over 30 cities, including Los Angeles, London, Berlin, 
and New York. Between the spring of 2013 and the spring of 2015, Homejoy grew 
from 20 employees to over 100 including “city managers, customer support, and an 
enviable engineering team poached from giants like Facebook and Google.” Homejoy 
could not attract enough customers or hire a sufficient number of professional clean-
ers in cities with more geographically dispersed populations such as Tampa Bay, 
Florida; or Atlanta, Georgia. And Homejoy’s international expansion caused numerous 
problems. In Berlin it was difficult to meet the demand for cleaners and in London, 
American best practices for cleaning were of no value.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
45
Basic supply chain and operations also failed. Homejoy’s city managers spent too 
much money on cleaning supplies because they did not know which products worked 
best, they didn’t track unused supplies, and they failed to negotiate low-priced supply 
deals. Homejoy’s service quality was also poor. Many first-time customers were dis-
satisfied or suffered a last-minute cancellation. One problem was a flaw in its scheduling 
algorithm that only allotted 30 minutes for cleaners to cross Manhattan as they 
traveled from Brooklyn to New Jersey. Despite repeated requests from Homejoy’s 
cleaners, it took months before Homejoy’s engineers began fixing the algorithm.
Cleaners would arrive late and angry customers would demand discounts—furthering 
heightening Homejoy’s cash burn rate. If the stress was not enough to make it hard 
to retain good cleaners, Homejoy’s below-industry-average pay—$15 an hour that 
barely covered transportation costs and forced workers into very long hours to make 
ends meet—almost guaranteed high turnover. And after cleaners quit, Homejoy could 
not figure out how to distinguish in hiring between good and bad ones. Moreover, in 
order to comply with IRS regulations regarding contractors, Homejoy city managers 
could not require cleaners to attend training classes. And Homejoy could not control 
quality very well—it would simply stop sending jobs to cleaners who frequently can-
celed at the last minute or worked fewer than 30 hours a week. Homejoy did not 
require a dress code, uniform, or standard set of cleaning tasks.
Last-minute cancellations were particularly damaging to Homejoy’s service quality 
ratings because it could only make up for the canceled appointment 15% to 20% 
of the time. This problem was particularly pronounced in cities where the demand 
for cleaners exceeded the supply. Homejoy’s best cleaners would set up their own 
services so they could boost their pay. But only soon before it shuttered did Homejoy 
fulfill customer requests to work with the same cleaner. “We were trapped between 
being accountable to our customers and not being able to take much responsibility 
for quality of service. We couldn’t properly train our cleaners to meet fixed standards 
without fear of a legal backlash,” according to former Homejoy operations manager 
Anton Zietsman.
Case Analysis
Homejoy’s failure is a result of five flawed assumptions that companies 
should avoid if they are seeking growth by gaining share among their current 
customers:
• 
The CEO’s strengths are the company’s key to 
success. Homejoy’s top management acted as though 
building and operating a scheduling algorithm was the 
key to Homejoy’s success. It was not until too late in the 
company’s development before it realized that it needed 
to attract and retain the best cleaners and manage their 
customer relationships to achieve high levels of service.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
46
• 
Lower prices will always lure in new customers. 
Homejoy assumed that the only way to get custom-
ers was to offer them cleaning at a discounted price. 
Homejoy failed to appreciate that a one-time customer 
who received poor service would not buy again. And 
Homejoy would then need to spend heavily on marketing 
to replace the lost customer.
• 
The best way to beat a competitor is to copy its 
strategy. Homejoy lacked insight into the needs of its 
potential customers and concluded that the only way to 
grow would be to imitate the strategy of a fast-growing 
rival. Homejoy’s failure to listen to customers left it with 
little understanding of how it would be able to attract 
new customers, make them want to keep buying, and 
encourage them to recommend Homejoy to others in 
their social network.
• 
Employee quality and satisfaction are not impor-
tant. Homejoy lacked standards for cleaners that it 
could use to screen out people who would provide poor 
quality cleaning service or cancel appointments at the last 
minute. Moreover, Homejoy paid its cleaners less than 
subsistence wages and was unable to assure that the 
training they needed to deliver high quality service.
• 
Unprofitable services can be overcome with suf-
ficient volume. Finally, Homejoy pursued rapid geo-
graphic expansion to boost its revenue growth without 
considering in sufficient depth the capabilities it would 
need in order to sustain its business in those new loca-
tions. Moreover, despite losing money on each transac-
tion, it lacked a strategy for becoming profitable and 
seemed to assume that another owner would take over 
the company and worry about that problem.
■
■Principle Four  Small companies seeking growth from new customers should conduct research 
to rank their purchase criteria, analyze competitor offerings, and deliver superior value.
When a small company seeks growth from a new customer group, the most 
important mistake to avoid is assuming that the strategy that worked for its 
current customers will also work for the new ones.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
47
In this area, small companies are no different than large ones. The big differ-
ence for small companies is that due to their limited cash reserves, going 
after new customers could be the last bet the company will be able to make. 
Whereas a large company might fail in its efforts to target new customers, 
that failure is not as likely to be fatal. But if a small company seeks to grow by 
targeting new customers, it is more likely that the move could require invest-
ments that would divert the company from its core customers and ultimately 
lower its chances of surviving. Therefore, small companies must be particularly 
cautious when they seek growth from new customers. They should have very 
well-researched answers to questions such as the following:
• 
Are we earning sufficient profit from our core customers?
• 
If so, have we grown as much as we can from selling to 
them?
• 
Would a new group of customers be more profitable?
• 
If so, what product can we offer those new customers 
that they will eagerly purchase?
• 
What is the investment required to design, build, sell, and 
service the new product?
• 
Will that investment pay off before we run out of cash?
Small companies lack the resources to hire a big consulting firm to answer 
these questions, but they should find a way to get good answers before betting 
they can get growth by selling to new customers.
Semi-Successful: Actifio One Targets $580 Billion 
Small and Medium-Sized Business (SMB) Market
Introduction
In early 2015, Waltham, Massachusetts-based data management start-up 
Actifio announced that it would seek to grow by adding small- and medium-
sized business customers to its original Fortune 1000 customer base. But by 
July 2016, Actifio had shifted its strategy and the results suggested a mixed 
picture for its future.
Case Scenario
Founded in 2009, Actifio made appliances that helped companies save money on 
data storage by reducing to one the many copies of corporate data that companies 
traditionally stored for various different purposes including backup and recovery, 
compliance, testing, and data analysis.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
48
Companies bought Actifio’s products because making and saving copies of their 
data—as many as 12 per company for uses like backup and application testing—
was costly. Actifio saves companies money by letting them do all those things with a 
single “golden copy.” This saved them money—for every dollar a company invested in 
Actifio’s product, customers saved as much as $15. As of June 2016, Actifio had raised 
a total of $207.5 million from investors including Advanced Technology Ventures, 
Andreessen Horowitz, Technology Crossover Ventures, Tiger Global Management, 
Greylock Partners, and North Bridge Venture Partners. In its most recent funding 
round in March 2014, Actifio raised $100 million led by Tiger Global Management 
at a valuation of $1.1 billion. In an earlier round in 2013, Actifio had raised $50 
million in a Series D round that valued the company at $500 million. As a private 
company, Actifio was under no obligation to disclose its financial results; however, in 
March 2014, Actifio revealed that its revenues for 2014 would be “well over” $40 
million and that its average deal size was $388,000.
In 2012, Actifio thought it would be going public in 2014. But that did not happen. On 
February 2, 2015, I spoke with Actifio CEO Ash Ashutosh after which it become clearer 
why the company did not go public in 2014 and what it planned to do to get there. 
In previous years Actifio had been heavily dependent on large accounts—making its 
revenues and profits lumpy and thus not as appealing to public company investors. To 
remedy the lumpiness, Actifio wanted to provide a service to the Small- and Medium-
Sized Enterprise (SME) market that it hoped would smooth out its financial results 
by adding many smaller accounts that paid regularly and more predictably. This was a 
clear change in strategy for Actifio, which in June 2014 was going for growth from big 
companies. “We keep reaching for bigger numbers. And we are executing—coming 
in every day and closing new business. We used to focus on Global 2000 companies, 
then Fortune 500. Now we are going to the Fortune 5. The transformation that we 
bring is so large that we are having an impact in the biggest companies,” Ashutosh 
said. But in February 2015, Actifio announced that it would target small- and medium-
sized businesses—a market amounting to $580 billion worth of IT spending—by 
launching Actifio One, a “business resiliency cloud” service that enabled small- and 
medium-sized businesses to store and retrieve their applications.
Until then, Actifio had been selling an appliance that combined commodity hardware 
and its own software that it called Actifio CDS. In 2014, Actifio launched Actifio 
Sky—what it referred to as ”the next generation of our technology that required no 
third party hardware and ran on a virtual machine.” An early customer—the Town 
of Banff, Alberta, suggested that Actifio One was competitive. Andrew Wheelhouse, 
IT coordinator for the Town of Banff said, “I was very impressed with the innovative 
Actifio One software service as well as the excellent technical assistance, ease of 
implementation and purchasing.” His decision to buy boiled down to two factors—
rapid data restoration and competitive price. “Actifio One is price competitive. But 
more importantly, if you need something to work, it needs to work. And while you are 
struggling with a long, slow restore process, you won’t be congratulating yourself on 
saving a few dollars at the purchase,” argued Wheelhouse.

49
Actifio’s new strategy would require an investment in marketing and a simpler user 
interface. As Ashutosh said, “The go-to-market model is different, that’s been the real 
investment here. This is a lower average order value, higher velocity, more channel-
friendly offering. We’re also making investments to simplify the software user interface 
and better enable customers to support themselves.”
To be sure, Actifio saw itself as helping to solve customer problems rather than trying 
to take customers from rivals such as EMC. “That erosion will continue, sure. But we 
don’t really focus on winning share from the old guard. It’s all about solving customer 
problems for us, and [Actifio One] will most certainly do that,” noted Ashutosh. Actifio 
did not expect the new service to generate significant revenue in the short run. After 
all, its SME customers paid an estimated $200,000 a year while larger companies 
spent as much as between $1.8 million and $2 million on Actifio subscriptions.
But it did expect Actifio One to help it tell a better story to public market investors. 
“As we begin telling our story to institutional investors in the public market, we rec-
ognize the importance of our business being both high growth and highly predictable, 
and we think offerings like this will play an important part,” he said.
Things did not work out quite as Ashutosh had planned. As he told me on July 12, 
2016, he thought that it would be much more efficient to sell to distribution partners 
who sold to SMEs. “With big companies, it takes us 83 days to convince them that we 
can generate business value. But it can take six to 14 months for their procurement 
departments to qualify us and pay us as a first-time supplier. Working with distribu-
tion partners who sell to SMEs, the procurement process is shorter—20 to 80 days.”
He set up Actifio One along the lines that Clayton Christensen prescribed for disrup-
tive technologies—as a separate subsidiary charged with killing the parent. “We 
spun out a separate group across the street. After one-and-a-half quarters we real-
ized that the logic was right but the reality was that we had the organizational DNA 
of working closely with large enterprises—developing technology solutions to work 
with petabytes of data,” said Ashutosh. Actifio then realized that it lacked the capa-
bilities to succeed in selling to SMEs. “One of the biggest differences in working with 
SMEs was how we needed to run finance. Whereas big companies might make three 
to five big payments during a contract, SMEs would pay monthly. To bill and collect 
from them we needed to add 20 people and be PCI-compliant so we could accept 
credit cards from them. Also, we were uncomfortable not having a direct relationship 
with the end-users of our product,” he said. Actifio decided to scrap its separate sub-
sidiary and instead license its technology to bigger “service providers”—companies 
that deliver an array of IT services to SMEs. As Ashutosh explained, “We license 
our technology to five of the 10 largest service providers that deal with SMEs. Like 
large organizations, they make a smaller number of large payments. And they may 
have 100 to 600 SME customers within a region. To sell to them, we need to show 
that our technology will help their SME customers to cut capital expenditures and 
achieve operational excellence.”

In 2012, Ashutosh told me that he wanted Actifio to go public in 2014. That did 
not happen. Nevertheless it continued to hold onto many well-known companies 
as customers. At the start of 2016, Actifio had nearly 600 customers—including 
Unilever, HBO, Netflix, IBM, SunGard, and Time Warner Cable’s NaviSite—in 36 
countries, double the number in 2014. And in June 2016, he told CRN that Actifio 
did not need to go public and its goal was to get cash flow positive in 2016. That 
was when Ashutosh reported that despite his 2015 call that an IPO was "the next 
big milestone" for Actifio, he expected that to be delayed until at least 2017—after 
the company was profitable for the first time—which he hoped to accomplish by 
the end of 2016.
Actifio cited Uber’s ability to raise capital privately as a reason not to rush an IPO. 
“This fascination with being public is a little overrated and I think we’re learning now, 
very quickly, that you can create Uber—a $67 billion company—being completely 
private, so why go public unless we have to?,” he told CRN UK. How would Actifio 
become profitable by the end of 2016? “[First] you spend time building the core 
technology, then you spend time building the core business. The third stage is how do 
you scale up this business to be a large institution? That’s the phase we’re moving 
into," he told CRN UK. “We are focusing on getting to be a profitable business so 
we can create a sustaining institution. It’s going to be growth balanced with getting 
to be a profitable company—that’s going to be a big tipping point for us this year.”
Case Analysis
The mixed outcome of Actifio’s strategy to target a new customer group 
reveals four important lessons for small business leaders:
• 
Pick a compelling mission. Actifio had a clear rea-
son for targeting SMEs—a desire to smooth out its 
lumpy cash collections to make its financial statements 
more compelling to public investors. While this may not 
be the most exalted of missions, it was clearly one that 
would help investors and employees realize their financial 
goals—therefore it had motivational power.
• 
Understand the distinct requirements of the new 
customers. Actifio did not make its shareholders the 
sole focus of its SME strategy. It also concentrated its 
attention on the specific requirements of potential SME 
customers—a desire for quick restoration of their IT sys-
tems after a business interruption and a low price.
• 
Build a better product. Actifio’s customer, the Town 
of Banff, bought Actifio One because it satisfied those 
needs—it offered rapid recovery at a low price. Actifio’s 
success here recognizes a fundamental condition for 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
51
successful growth—new customers will only consider a 
small company’s product if it delivers competitively supe-
rior features at a lower price.
• 
Invest in a new strategy. Actifio realized after about 
16 weeks of trying that it had the wrong strategy for win-
ning with SMBs. It should have realized ahead of time that 
competing for SMB business would involve different capa-
bilities throughout the value chain—including sales and 
marketing, after-sales service, and billing and collection. 
Moreover, although Ashutosh hoped that channel part-
ners would shorten the time to close deals, he should 
have seen that working with channel partners would be 
frustrating. After all before launching its SMB strategy, 
Actifio had valued working directly with its big company 
end users. By working with channel partners, Actifio lost 
its direct customer interaction.
Unsuccessful: Color Labs
Introduction
If a company tries to grow by serving one group of customers and fails, it 
should at least learn something that helps it succeed with the second group 
of customers it targets. The fundamental lesson that companies must learn if 
they seek growth from new customers is that they must offer them a product 
that the new customers see as an irresistible value. That perceived value could 
come in many bundles. Companies could deliver a good product at a very low 
price compared to competitors, or they could offer a much broader set of 
features at the same price. The most common reason small companies fail is 
that they burn through all their capital before they figure out a product that 
customers believe is an irresistible value—making them eager to pay a higher 
price than the company’s costs to design, build, ship, and service it.
Case Scenario
That is what happened to Palo Alto, California-based photo-sharing app, Color Labs. 
It shut down in December 2012 after burning through much of the $41 million it 
raised. Color initially tried to sell a location-based social network—that failed and it 
“pivoted” to a photo and video sharing service that also failed. Color was cofounded 
by Bill Nguyen and Peter Pham on August 1, 2010. Despite his failure to build 
companies that lasted, Nguyen’s previous track record of starting and selling compa-
nies—in 1998 Nguyen started a web-based fax service that he sold for $850 million 
two months before the dot com crash; and in 2009 Apple bought Lala, a cloud-based 
music service Nguyen started, for a reported $80 million—made him a venture

52
capital magnet. By October 2012, Apple had acquired Color’s 20-person technology 
team and some of its key intellectual property assets for $7 million and Color Labs 
ceased to operate at the end of 2012.
The intervening two years between Color’s launch and its shutdown reveal some 
classic start-up errors. Nguyen’s pulled the plug on his first idea—a game called Furr, 
in which “this furry creature would basically colonize the world everywhere you went 
physically with your phone, buildings would emerge”—after three months.
From there, Color Labs worked on a photo-sharing app that it launched in March 
2011.The free app that let “people in close proximity to one another gain real-time 
access to photos, video, and text messages, simultaneously, from multiple smart-
phones”—was launched on the Apple App Store and Android Market. The app’s 
launch was overshadowed by news that Color Labs had raised $41 million “without 
any proof of concept, traction with the public, or revenue generated.”
The day it was launched users rated the app a terrible “one or two stars out of 
five—nails in the coffin, given an oversaturated app market that was spawning more 
than 1,000 new apps a day. The problem was simple: In order for Color to work, 
many users had to be in a similar location, but since Color hadn’t widely seeded 
the app prelaunch, users arrived to a social network that resembled a ghost town,” 
according to Fast Company. A few months later, Pham was fired and by June 2011, 
it was clear that the app was not a winner. “Despite the company’s riches, the app 
landed with a thud, attracting few users and many complaints from those who did try 
it. ‘It would be pointless even if I managed to understand how it works,’ one reviewer 
wrote in the Apple App Store,” according to the New York Times.
In retrospect, it is clear that Color was beaten to the pot of gold at the end of the 
photo-sharing rainbow by a lean competitor, Instagram, which started with a mere 
$500,000, hired a small team, and raised capital as it achieved product success. In 
April 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram—whose 30 million registered users gener-
ated no revenue—for $1 billion a few weeks after Instagram had raised $50 million 
at a $500 million valuation. Instagram may have sold too early—about three years 
later Instagram had 300 million users and two analysts valued the company—as if 
it were independent—at $37 billion. By contrast, Color was careless with its cash. It 
“spent $350,000 to buy the web address color.com, and an additional $75,000 to 
buy colour.com. It rents a cavernous office in downtown Palo Alto, where 38 employ-
ees work in a space with room for 160, amid beanbag chairs, tents for napping and 
a hand-built half-pipe skateboard ramp,” according to the Times.
Nguyen was bruised by the failure but decided to build a new service to “compete 
with Apple, Google, and Facebook by tying together group messaging, recommenda-
tions, and local search, all while making money through advertising. He [planned] 
to build applications that will use data from Facebook to create temporary social 
networks, say at a conference or sporting event, to help users meet people who grew 
up in the same town or like the same band,” reported the Times. He boasted that 
Color’s new service would “literally turn your Facebook network from 500 people to 
750 million people,” according to the Times. Nguyen never launched the new service.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
53
Part of this failure may have been due to his dismissive attitude toward offering a 
better product than what rivals are providing. “I have this other really bad trait. I 
never use anyone else’s products but my own. I never do a competitive matrix ever. 
My entire life, I’ve never done it. I could care less what other people make. I have no 
interest whatsoever. I don’t ever listen to any of it. I mean, I literally don’t think there’s 
anything to be learned from other people’s stuff,” he boasted to Fast Company.
Perhaps Nguyen convinced himself that if he aped Apple’s late CEO Steve Jobs he 
could convince people that he was just as talented. “The fallback of the visionary 
is they say, ‘I don’t need to talk to people because there’s no point in doing focus 
groups on revolutionary products.’ But that’s such a false dichotomy. No one is sug-
gesting you make all of your decisions based on how people respond to surveys,” Paul 
Kedrosky explained to Fast Company.
A few months before Color shut down, Nguyen stopped running the company on a 
day-to-day basis. Then reports trickled out that Color was winding down its opera-
tions and being bought by Apple. In November 2012, a post on Color’s web site 
announced the end of the company: “We hope you’ve enjoyed sharing your stories 
via real-time video. Regretfully, the app will no longer be available after 12/31/2012.”
How could Color have gotten a dime of funding? Color’s failure reveals a fundamen-
tal flaw among Silicon Valley investors who combine a blind faith in an entrepreneur 
who has made money in the past with a fear of losing ground to rivals. As Kedrosky 
told Fast Company, “Color was just this magnificent confluence of everything the 
Valley likes to fund: It had pieces of what had made money for people before, which 
is to say mobile and photos; it had an experienced team; it had a multiple-success 
CEO; and it brought together some investors who were really eager to re-demon-
strate their bona fides.” “The unfortunate thing about Silicon Valley is that it isn’t the 
best ideas that get funded, it’s the people who do. I’ve been a beneficiary of that,” 
Nguyen said to Fast Company.
Case Analysis
Color Labs’s failure is a result of five flawed growth strategy assumptions that 
companies should avoid if they are seeking growth by gaining share among 
their current customers:
• 
The CEO can dictate what the market will buy. 
Nguyen acted as though he shared with Steve Jobs the 
visionary talents needed to persuade millions of poten-
tial customers to buy his products—regardless of what 
those potential customers needed. In fact, Jobs tended to 
attack large markets with a superior product rather than 
trying to create a new one as Nguyen attempted to do.

Chapter 2 | Growth via New or Current Customers
54
• 
There is no need to analyze competitors while 
designing a new product. Nguyen did not spend time 
examining competitors’ products while designing the 
Color Labs apps. While he believed that this was a waste 
of time, in retrospect that could have helped Color Labs 
to succeed. For example, if Nguyen had noticed the rapid 
growth of Instagram, he might have learned why its ser-
vice was so popular and might have been able to build a 
better product.
• 
Getting customer feedback before launching is a 
waste of time. Customer feedback immediately follow-
ing the launch of its app in March 2012 indicated that 
Color Labs assumed that it would be popular without 
getting customer feedback. While Nguyen was clearly 
aping Jobs—who famously disdained market research, 
the app’s poor customer ratings eloquently testify to 
Nguyen’s overestimation of his entrepreneurial ability.
• 
Employee retention is irrelevant. Nguyen was able 
to hire a team of brand-name executives to build Color 
Labs. Those executives may have been hoping they would 
get rich quickly—but when Nguyen’s initial product ideas 
failed, he was quick to blame his executive hires and man-
age them out of the company. The fundamental mistake 
Nguyen made here was to assume that he was the only 
one who mattered and the talented people he attracted 
were mere window dressing to attract investment.
• 
Careful cash management is pointless. Finally, 
Color Labs excelled at raising venture capital but Nguyen 
decided to spend significant amounts of cash on frills 
that did not contribute to the quality of its product or 
growth in its number of active users. Nguyen’s out of 
control spending was based on a flawed assumption that 
he would always be able to get enough customer adop-
tion to persuade another company to buy his company 
before it ran out of cash. While Nguyen excelled at raising 
capital, he was weak at using that capital to build a suc-
cessful company.
The lessons from these cases have two critical implications for companies:
• 
Boards must assess whether the current CEO has the 
mindset and skills needed to conceive and execute an 
effective growth strategy from current or new custom-
ers. If not, the board may wish to replace the current 
CEO with one who can.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
55
• 
CEOs should recognize that despite considerable over-
laps, growth strategies for large and small companies vary 
depending on whether the company is targeting growth 
from current or new customer groups.
Applying the Principles of Growth through 
Current or New Customers
Leaders seeking to assess whether they apply these principles to their organi-
zations should be able to answer Yes to these six questions:
• 
What percent of next year’s growth will come from sell-
ing more to your current customers?
• 
How much of next year’s growth do you expect to come 
from new customers?
• 
Are your revenues growing faster than your industry?
• 
If so, what makes your company’s value proposition bet-
ter than that of rivals?
• 
If not, why is your company growing more slowly than 
the industry?
• 
How does your company plan to improve the value it 
creates for current and/or new customers to accelerate 
its revenue growth?
Chapter 8: Growth Road Maps provides a detailed methodology for applying 
the principles of growth through new products.
Summary
Speeding up growth by selling to current or new customers is a relatively 
obvious strategy. The case studies we’ve reviewed in this chapter reveal that 
the biggest challenge in getting results from such a strategy may be the mind-
set and skills of the CEO. If a CEO is intellectually humble enough to listen to 
customers, study competitors, and work with internal team members, then 
the company may be able to find and exploit growth opportunities either 
from selling to more members of its current customer segment or from gain-
ing a significant share of a new customer segment.
In Chapter 3 we will explore how and why companies achieve faster growth 
by expanding within their current geographies and/or new ones. In so doing 
we will highlight the importance of gaining insights into the challenges of over-
coming various forms of distance between the company’s current geographies 
and potential new ones.

Growth via 
New or Current 
Geographies
In Chapter 2, we saw how companies get off the ground by finding and solving 
customer problems. Seeking growth, they sell that solution to customers who 
share important attributes with their original customers. Eventually, compa-
nies tap out the growth potential from their initial group of customers. In that 
case, leaders seek growth from new or current geographies. Quite often, the 
geographic expansion strategies depend heavily on whether the company is 
founded in a country with a large or small domestic market for its products.
A company started in a big domestic market—such as the United States—
tends to delay geographic expansion until it has reached its market share limit 
among its core customer groups. Whereas a company started in a market 
with relatively few potential customers—such as Israel—might be born global. 
More specifically, companies whose founders hail from small countries sell 
globally from their inception—often co-locating in the small country and the 
big one right from the start.
While the idea that globalization means the death of distance is popular, the 
reality is that significant distances remain between the location where a com-
pany starts and the new geographies into which it seeks to expand. Companies

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies

should consider using the Cultural, Administrative, Geographic, and Economic 
(CAGE) framework to evaluate these distances before launching into new 
geographies.
This framework can help leaders to evaluate four key questions:
• 
How wide is the cultural gap between our current 
geography and the future one? The first dimension 
that companies should consider is cultural distance—
measured by factors such as differences and similarities 
in language, work style, religion, and ethnic makeup.
• 
How significant is the administrative gap between 
our current geography and the future one? 
Companies should next analyze the administrative dis-
tance between the core and new geography—investigating  
factors such as the absence of colonial ties, shared  
currency, shared legal system, shared attitudes toward  
corruption, and common political aims.
• 
How great is the physical distance between our 
current geography and the future one? Companies 
should analyze how easy or difficult it is to bridge the 
physical distance between the core and new geogra-
phy—studying factors such as the quality of roads and 
bridges, the robustness of air and ground transportation 
networks, the quality and breadth of communications 
networks, and how these factors might affect the quality 
of the company’s product as it travels from the factory to 
customers in the new geography.
• 
How big is the economic distance between our 
current geography and the future one? Finally, 
companies should assess whether they can bridge the 
economic distance between the core and the new geog-
raphy—analyzing factors such as differences in labor 
costs; customer price sensitivity; natural, financial, and 
human resources; and distribution systems.
Principles of Growth from Geography
What distinguishes the winners who search for growth from geographic expan-
sion? In this chapter we’ll see that successful geographic expansion depends 
on a combination the CEO’s intellectual humility and a detailed understand-
ing of the specific opportunities and risks inherent in geographic expansion. 
These general principles take different forms depending on whether a com-
pany is large or small.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
59
Large companies seeking growth from current geography should be open to 
learning about how customer needs are evolving and develop a compelling 
product vision for satisfying those needs more effectively than competitors. 
Conversely, companies that fail to achieve growth goals assume that strategies 
that worked in the past will solve future challenges, they fail to apply their 
strengths to growth opportunities, they ignore changing customer needs and 
new competitors, and they allow internal departments to battle each other 
instead of coordinating them.
When large companies expand into new geographies, they ought initially to 
target countries with the smallest CAGE distance from their home geography. 
They should also strike a balance between the urge to tailor the product to 
each country and the efficiency benefits of a standardized one-world product. 
By contrast, large companies that fail at expanding into new geographies set 
unrealistically high goals, ignore CAGE distance, and fail to take appropriate 
action when it becomes clear that those goals are out of reach.
Small companies seeking growth from current geographies must assure that the 
operations in their current location works flawlessly before expanding. Such 
small companies should carefully eliminate flaws in current locations, research 
new locations rigorously, overestimate the capital and time to achieve success 
in new locations, and measure performance to fix problems and invest where 
growth is most promising. Conversely, small companies that fail in this endeavor 
tend to assume that strategies that worked for the CEO in the past will work 
again, they overinvest in growth at the market peak, and they ignore changing 
customer needs and the potential to learn from successful upstart strategies.
Small companies seeking growth from new geographies must apply intellectual 
humility in adapting the company’s strengths to alleviate customer pain in new 
geographies with minimal CAGE distance, understand the pain of customers 
in those locations, and apply the company’s strengths to relieving that pain. 
Similar to the other cases, failure tends to flow from executives who assume a 
strategy that worked for a previous market will yield success in the new one, 
ignore customer feedback, and disregard the strategies of successful rivals.
Case Studies
Let’s examine pairs of case studies of successful and unsuccessful applications 
of four principles of growth from geography:
• 
Large companies seeking growth from current 
geographies should build and market products that beat 
competitors in customers’ top-ranked purchase criteria.
• 
Large companies seeking growth from new geog-
raphies should target locations with the shortest CAGE 
distance from their core.

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
60
• 
Small companies seeking growth from current 
geographies should find and market to customers who 
value their products’ superior attributes.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from new geog-
raphies should market to customers in new loca-
tions with low CAGE distance who value their product 
attributes.
■
■Principle One  Large companies seeking growth from current geographies should build and 
market products that beat competitors in customers’ top-ranked purchase criteria.
Companies seeking growth from within their current geography can reach 
their goal by understanding specifically what customers want and giving them 
more of those benefits than competitors do. While that sounds painfully 
obvious, many companies can’t pull it off. That’s because in order to achieve 
growth within a company’s current market, companies must know more than 
their rivals about customers and technology and turn that superior insight 
into consistent actions that deliver customers a better outcome.
As we will explore later in this chapter, leaders can forge effective growth 
strategies for gaining share in their current geography by taking five steps:
• 
Listen to customers to understand the specific, ranked 
factors they use to compare among competing suppliers.
• 
Ask them to evaluate your company relative to competi-
tors on each of those factors.
• 
Understand the level of performance your company 
would need to achieve for your company to gain market 
share.
• 
Build or enhance the skills—such as product develop-
ment, marketing, and service—needed to deliver a com-
petitively superior customer experience.
• 
Lead the design, manufacture, delivery, sales, and service 
of the new products your company introduces to achieve 
growth.
Doing these things is particularly difficult for a large company. That’s because 
large companies are often slow to adapt and lock themselves into ways of 
working that make it more difficult for customers as executives struggle to 
beat out internal rivals for the next promotion. In some ways, seeking to 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
61
expand within a company’s current geography is easier because the company 
does not have to grabble with the CAGE distance that might exist between 
the company’s core market and destination geography.
Successful: T-Mobile Wins U.S. Customers  
from Rivals
Introduction
Bellevue, Washington-based wireless carrier T-Mobile added nearly 33 mil-
lion new customers in the United States due to a new bundle of services—
dubbed Un-carrier because T-Mobile believed that traditional carriers such as 
AT&T would find it unprofitable to match its strategy. Specifically, T-Mobile's 
Un-carrier strategy offered consumers high network quality, responsive ser-
vice, and competitive rates. T-Mobile’s customer growth extended over a five-
year period as its share of U.S. wireless subscriptions grew from 11% in the 
first quarter of 2011 to 16.3% in the first quarter of 2016. T-Mobile’s increased 
market share was accompanied by a 24% compound annual growth in the 
number of customers. According to 451 Research, “From the end of 2012 
through the end of 2015—the three-year period of Un-carrier—T-Mobile has 
grown from 33.4 million customers to 63.2 million customers. That growth 
has catapulted its market share from 10% to 17%, and enabled it to surpass 
Sprint to become the number-three US-based operator.”
Case Scenario
T-Mobile’s growth occurred at the same time that rivals were losing market share. For 
example, in April 2015, T-Mobile announced that it had added 1.8 million customers. 
During that same period, “Verizon Wireless reported disappointing subscriber growth, 
and while AT&T managed to reduce its rate of customer defections, its own subscriber 
growth is well short of the rate that T-Mobile was enjoying,” according to CNET.
T-Mobile’s U.S. growth resulted from Un-carrier—a bundle of services designed 
to eliminate wireless consumers’ biggest annoyances with larger carriers. Between 
March 2013 and December 2015, Un-carrier consisted of a sequence of eight 
service changes:
• 
Offer opt-out contracts. In March 2013, it eliminated 
longer-term contracts—replacing them with phone-leasing 
arrangements out of which customers could opt at any time—
by giving up the phone or paying for the remaining balance.
• 
Provide more frequent phone upgrades. Its second 
major change was to replace two-year upgrade contracts with 
its JUMP program that enabled consumers to pay a slightly 
higher fee to obtain a newer model phone more frequently.

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
62
• 
Eliminate data roaming charges. T-Mobile’s third change 
was to replace high international data roaming charges in 
100 countries by letting consumers use data networks so they 
could send messages without incurring high roaming charges.
• 
Pay rivals’ early termination fees to win new customers. 
The fourth Un-carrier tactic was to pay off the Early Termination 
Fees for Verizon, AT&T, or Sprint customers if they switched to 
T-Mobile.
• 
Boost network quality. Fifth, T-Mobile introduced a new 
wireless network technology that delivered better voice quality 
and data transfer.
• 
Deliver free music streaming. Sixth, after observing the 
large amounts of data that T-Mobile subscribers downloaded 
to play music on their smartphones, T-Mobile introduced 
Rhapsody unRadio—a free and advertising-less music stream-
ing service.
• 
Expand Wi-Fi. Next T-Mobile expanded its Wi-Fi service to 
include connections in airplanes.
• 
Enable unused minutes roll over. Eighth, T-Mobile allowed 
customers to roll over their unused data into the next month—
at no additional charge for all new and old subscribers.
Each Un-carrier service introduction required T-Mobile to change its operations—for 
example, to boost network quality, T-Mobile invested in new network equipment and 
software. When it launched Un-carrier, T-Mobile’s network was behind that of its 
rivals. However by the end of 2015, it had mostly caught up—covering 305 million 
points of presence with its (Long-Term Evolution) LTE technology and reaching 268 
markets with its wideband LTE technology. In order to introduce Rhapsody unRadio, 
T-Mobile had to negotiate a partnership with the Rhapsody streaming service—to 
make this work the companies shared payment processes and technology.
T-Mobile’s strategy was marred by one slightly unpleasant reality—it chose growth 
over high profitability. Between 2012 and 2015, its revenues soared at an 85% 
annual rate from $5.1 billion to $32.1 billion but its 2015 net margin was a mere 
2%. Yet investors seemed to approve of its choice—between March 2014 when it 
introduced Un-carrier and July 8, 2016, its shares rose 130% from $19.60 to $45.
The architect of the Un-carrier strategy, T-Mobile CEO John Legere, had significant 
executive experience within and outside the telecommunications industry before 
he joined T-Mobile USA in September 2012 as president and CEO. His 34 years 
of industry experience included serving as CEO of Global Crossing, president of 
Dell’s European operations, and president of AT&T’s Asia-Pacific operations and 
global strategy. Though he had been in the telecommunications industry for many 
years before joining T-Mobile, he thought of wireless as very different. However, he

became comfortable with the industry by listening in his first few months as CEO to 
T-Mobile’s customer service calls. These calls revealed that customers disliked tradi-
tional wireless services providers. As Legere explained to Fast Company, “None of 
the [technology] mattered. There was this plethora of hatred for this industry and 
this never-ending list of things people wanted to change. They didn’t want to know 
what I don’t know. They don’t care!"
Though T-Mobile had considered changing its strategy to respond to customer dissat-
isfaction, its managers had been afraid of following through. Legere’s predecessor said, 
“We hate the rules of the industry, but we’re tied to them. No one will be crazy enough 
to do anything about it.” But Legere—who had previously taken Global Crossing out of 
bankruptcy and sold it for $3 billion in 2011—was not afraid. At the January 2013 
Consumer Electronics Show early in his T-Mobile tenure—when employees were still 
discouraged after a failed takeover attempt by AT&T, the cumulative effect of listening 
to all those customer service calls gave him a strong desire to change the industry. 
“My head exploded and I just went on a rant about the wireless industry and how I 
didn’t get it,” Legere said. Then he started asking, “Why, why, why? People hate con-
tracts. Let’s not have them! ‘You can’t,’ companies say. Why?,” he concluded.
In addition to winning customers by removing industry practices that annoy customers, 
he also takes pleasure in beating competitors to market with good ideas. In December 
2014, T-Mobile learned that Legere’s former employer, AT&T, planned to introduce a 
new data-rollover plan. AT&T’s plan was scheduled to launch a month ahead of the 
one that T-Mobile had in store. To beat AT&T, T-Mobile introduced its own offering 
a week later. Moreover, Legere kept coming up with new ways to delight customers 
and tweak its rivals. In July 2016, Pokemon GO—an augmented reality version of the 
Pokemon game for smart devices—became an instant hit following its July 8 launch.
On July 14, T-Mobile announced a promotion that would provide free data to 
Pokemon GO players. T-Mobile subscribers were offered a chance—between July 
19 and August 9—to play the game without the resulting data usage applying to 
their data caps. The promotion lasted a year after subscribers claimed it and came 
with “one free Lyft ride up to $15 and a discount on battery packs to keep custom-
ers' phones powered up,” according to the Washington Post.
Case Analysis
Legere’s success at winning new customers within T-Mobile’s current geography 
reveals four important lessons for leaders seeking to achieve similar success:
• 
Pick a CEO with a growth mindset. A common 
pattern of successful big company growth strategies is 
the selection of a CEO who has experience outside the 
company and is not afraid to think and act in ways that 
improve customer satisfaction with its products. This 
was true with McDonald’s selection of Easterbrook and 
Legere at T-Mobile.

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
64
• 
Listen to customers complain. The wireless tele-
communications industry provides an excellent example 
of how monopolies and oligopolies tend to put corporate 
interests ahead of customers’. This creates opportunities 
for a growth-minded CEO. Legere was wise to listen to 
customer service calls as a way to identify many sources 
of customer dissatisfaction.
• 
Design, build, deliver, and service products that 
relieve their pain. As this case reveals, the CEO with an 
inertial mindset will tend to ignore information that does 
not confirm that that CEO already believes. However, a 
CEO with a growth mindset will take ideas for improving 
the customer experience that are obvious to lower-level 
employees who listen to customers each day and imple-
ment them. Legere was clever in realizing that T-Mobile 
could offer new service features in a sequence over time 
that would relieve big sources of customer dissatisfaction.
• 
Repeat the previous two steps. Sadly for T-Mobile, 
competitors could often copy many of Legere’s innova-
tions but that did not discourage him. Instead he con-
tinued to listen to customers and to add new services 
that yielded rapid customer growth at the expense of 
competitors’ market share.
Unsuccessful: Avon Products Loses Share in 
­Developing Countries
Introduction
Founded in 1886, by July 2016 Avon Products had suffered 18 consecutive 
quarters of declining revenue as it lost customers—particularly due to its 
inability to retain sales representatives in developing countries such as China 
and Brazil which by 2010 had surpassed the United States as its largest mar-
ket. After peaking in June 2004 under Andrea Jung—its CEO from November 
1999 to April 2012—Avon’s stock had since plummeted. Jung was replaced 
that April in the wake of a bribery scandal in China by Sheri McCoy—who 
rose to vice chairman at Johnson & Johnson before being passed over to suc-
ceed William Weldon as its CEO. Under McCoy, Avon’s stock plummeted 91% 
to $3.94 by July 2016. Avon’s financial performance cratered under McCoy—
who had no prior direct sales or cosmetics experience. In 2011 Avon gener-
ated $11.3 billion in sales and $514 million in profit. But by the end of 2015, 
its revenues had plunged nearly in half to $6.2 billion and it posted a net loss 
of $1.1 billion.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
65
Case Scenario
The story behind that plunge has much to do with the decline of this 130-year-old 
company’s traditional business model of recruiting “Avon Ladies” to sell perfume 
door-to-door under the advertising tagline, “Ding-Dong Avon Calling.” Jung acted as 
though she was embarrassed by Avon’s door-to-door sales legacy. Instead, she tried to 
set Avon up as a competitor to more upscale brands such as Procter & Gamble and 
L’Oreal—not a surprising outcome given that Jung had previously worked at upscale 
brands Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale’s. Nevertheless, recruiting direct sellers 
was Avon’s heritage and still a big part of its business. By 2012, Avon employed 6.4 
million active representatives who marketed its lipsticks and lotions to consumers. 
The growing popularity of selling over the Internet created confusion within Avon. 
Should it try to sell more online and compete with its representatives? Or should it 
help its representatives to sell more using the Internet and social media?
Indeed, the Internet already seemed to be cutting into the profit contributions of its 
representatives. By 2012, operating profit per representative in the United States had 
plunged 75% over the past decade, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein. 
And Avon was clearly struggling to figure out the best answer to the second question. 
As Michele Risner, an Avon representative based in Gibson City, Illinois, told the Wall 
Street Journal, “I think [Avon is] still struggling with trying to figure out how it can help 
them. Some apps for smartphones would be something we could really benefit from.”
Avon could not answer representatives' questions regard how the Web could help 
their business “The big struggle with people is, 'How do I make a Facebook fan page? 
How do I do this on Twitter? Is it really going to help?,'” said Risner. In addition to direct 
selling from the Internet in the United States, Avon was missing the rapid growth of 
direct selling in emerging markets such as Brazil. However, Avon did not participate in 
the growth because of Jung’s lack of focus on its strength as a direct seller.
Between 2006 and 2011, the global market for direct selling grew 30% to $136 bil-
lion, according to Euromonitor International. Yet during those five years, Avon added 
a mere 1.1 percentage points to its 11.4% share of 2011’s direct selling market. One 
reason for its failure to keep up with the growth of global direct selling was Avon’s U.S. 
decline. Indeed by April 2015, Avon’s U.S. business door-to-door sales force that had 
shrunk for the each of the previous 19 quarters—tumbling 18% in 2014 alone, accord-
ing to Deutsche Bank. Avon’s market share tumbled from 10.2% in 2007 when it led the 
United States among direct sellers down to 4.3% in 2014, according to Euromonitor 
International. Mary Kay took over the top spot in the United States in 2013. 
Why did Avon lose in Brazil? It was not paying enough attention to its direct sellers there 
even as Brazil surpassed the United States in 2010 as its biggest market. Avon botched 
the introduction of an electronic invoicing system that the Brazilian government required. 
Problems with Avon’s computer systems tripled the number of service issues for represen-
tatives. Those systems problems led to missed late orders, inaccurate demand forecasts, 
late-arriving products, unfilled orders, and delayed shipments to representatives. Moreover, 
Brazilian representatives sold other vendors’ products—most notably Natura’s—which 

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
66
did not suffer the service interruptions that plagued Avon. It is remarkable that Avon did 
not lose all its business in Brazil—especially given that those sellers could make money 
by selling products of a rival that had better operations.
McCoy was not helping to turn things around. By the first quarter of 2016, Avon’s 
revenues had fallen nearly 16% and it lost $166 million—more money than the same 
quarter of 2015. This was the eighteenth straight quarter of declining revenues at 
Avon. And McCoy was struggling with how to bail out the rapidly sinking ship that Avon 
had become under her leadership. By December 2015, Avon was so hungry for cash 
that it agreed to give up control of its North American business to a New York hedge 
fund, Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus paid Avon $170 million for 80.1% of 
its North American business—which represented 14% of Avon’s 2015 revenues—and 
Cerberus coughed up another $435 million 16.6% of Avon’s listed shares.
Word of this move put a further damper on its sales representatives’ enthusiasm 
for the company. Elizabeth Balestracci, a successful Avon representative, was disil-
lusioned by this move. She had allowed her “Avon business to dwindle when she 
moved to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in 2013 and started working full-time as a 
radio-show host. She was ‘heartbroken’ to learn that Avon planned to sell its North 
American business,” according to the Wall Street Journal.
In June 2016, Moody’s downgraded Avon’s debt-paying ratings and gave its stock a 
negative ratings outlook. “The downgrade reflects the separation of the company’s 
North American business, risk associated with executing the new transformational 
plan, exposure to high volatile emerging markets, and challenging economic condi-
tions in its key regions,” according to Market Realist. Members of Avon’s board 
should have been asking themselves, Is McCoy the right leader for Avon? If not, what 
criteria should it use to pick Avon’s next CEO? Will the Transformation Plan produce 
sufficient revenue and profit growth? If not, what should Avon do instead?
Case Analysis
Its slow and painful decline reflects five flaws that help explain why Avon lost 
ground within its current geographies:
• 
Poor fit between CEO skills and strategic chal-
lenges. Jung and McCoy—while quite accomplished in 
their previous endeavors—did not have the skills needed 
to sustain Avon’s growth in the face of its many strategic 
challenges. Avon’s board clearly failed in retrospect with 
these two CEO choices.
• 
Failure to focus on strengths—in Avon’s case its 
representatives. Avon’s competitive advantage was its 
direct selling channel—however, the company did not fig-
ure out how to harness the Internet and social media to 
make its representatives more successful at bringing in 
new consumers and encouraging old ones to keep buying.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
67
• 
Inattentiveness to changes affecting consumers. 
Jung was so focused on her efforts to boost Avon’s brand 
prestige that she failed to notice the growing importance 
of online sales to consumers’ purchases of beauty prod-
ucts. A failure to track changes in consumers’ spending 
and purchasing habits can be fatal for a company seeking 
to grow—especially within its current geography.
• 
Failure to monitor competitors. Jung seemed to 
want to transform Avon into a rival to upscale retailers—
such as the ones where she had worked before. She was 
focusing on the wrong competitors—instead she should 
have been analyzing the strategies that caused Avon to 
lose market share in Brazil and China.
• 
Lack of internal coordination among different 
business functions. Finally, Avon was not good at coor-
dinating its marketing and IT staffs to produce seamless 
services that helped its direct sales representatives to 
achieve better results. As we have seen in many of the 
case studies in Chapter 2, failed execution of a strategy 
flows from the failure to coordinate different functions to 
pursue a shared growth goal.
■
■Principle Two  Large companies seeking growth from new geographies should target locations 
with the shortest Cultural, Administrative, Geographic, and Economic (CAGE) distance from their 
core.
When it comes to expanding into new geographies, too many companies 
have made the mistake of confusing that country’s population with its revenue 
potential for their products. A case in point is China—with a population of 
about 1.3 billion—which has drawn many U.S. companies seeking growth by 
selling their product to a population that is several times larger than their 
home market. Sadly for many of these companies, their efforts to generate 
profit growth in China resulted in ignominious retreats after years of strug-
gling to break in.
In 2006, electronics retailer Best Buy bought Five Star, a China-based appliance 
and electronics retailer with 136 stores for $180 million. At the time, Five 
Star had $700 million in revenues and was growing at a 50% annual rate. Best 
Buy considered the deal to be a way for it to learn how to reach the Chinese 
electronics market that was expected to grow at a 10% annual rate through 
2016 and to reach $100 billion by 2010. By June 2014—after struggling with 
cultural and economic differences, Best Buy wanted to sell Five Stars, which 

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
68
had expanded to 190 locations in the wake of a 10.5% decline in international 
revenue due in part to its inability to compete in China. By December 2014, 
it announced the sale of Five Stars for an undisclosed price to a Chinese real 
estate company.
How can leaders avoid such pitfalls and achieve faster growth in new geogra-
phies? They ought to follow a growth discipline that ranks new geographies 
based on four factors:
• 
The profit potential of the company’s industry in that 
geography;
• 
The CAGE between the company’s home market and the 
new geography;
• 
The company’s potential competitive strength in the 
geography; and
• 
The investment required to gain a meaningful position in 
that market and the expected return on that investment.
In a nutshell, to achieve faster geographic growth companies should focus on 
new geographies with the most profit potential, the shortest CAGE distance, 
in which they are likely to occupy the strongest competitive position and earn 
the highest return on their investment.
Successful: Netflix Goes Global
Introduction
In January 2015, Netflix announced plans to operate in 200 countries by 
2017—adding millions of new international customers in 2015 while defer-
ring expected profits. By July 2016, Netflix had made significant progress—
expanding from 50 to 130 countries and pursuing a risky strategy of offering a 
very similar product for different geographies—with the notable exception of 
China. In January 2015, Netflix stock rose 20% in the wake of beating expec-
tations for international subscriber growth by 13% to 2.43 million. At the 
time, Netflix was already operating in 50 countries but set the goal of adding 
150 new countries by 2017. But achieving that ambitious goal meant Netflix 
would need to overcome many challenges. Those included countries with 
limited broadband needed to watch video via mobile devices—in 2014 78% 
of developed market households had Internet access while only 31% of those 
in developing nations did, varying local regulations, and the cost of expanding 
licensing deals to new geographies. Another potential hurdle Netflix faced 
in adding 150 new countries in two years was that many of these smaller 
countries would receive a Netflix service with less local dubbing and less local 
content than Netflix had provided with its earlier international launches.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
69
Case Scenario
Netflix was confident that it could overcome the hurdles to growth due to what it 
had learned from offering its service in 50 countries. As CEO Reed Hastings said, 
“We already offer Netflix in about 50 countries and have learned a great deal about 
the content people prefer, the marketing they respond to and how to best organize 
ourselves for steady improvement.” Netflix also believed that it could overcome the 
cost of content licensing. Chief content officer Ted Sarandos explained that Netflix 
had been seeking worldwide distribution rights, for its original shows. Moreover, 
Sarandos anticipated that its original content would have an international audience. 
“It might be that there are some cultural barriers to U.S. content as we get into 
more exotic markets. But my guess is that we’re going to continue to see our original 
programming travel and carry the Netflix brand around the world.” Other challenges 
remained for Netflix—such as questions about whether it would need to provide tai-
lored strategies in each country by catering to unique needs for product packaging, 
marketing, and delivery, conforming to country-specific regulations for privacy, and 
aligning with each country’s unique billing and payment practices.
Netflix was poised to tread carefully in China. As Hastings explained, “For China, we 
are still exploring options—all of them modest. We’ll learn a great deal if we can 
successfully operate a small service in China centered on our original and other glob-
ally licensed content. Moreover, Netflix needs to get a license to offer service in China, 
and it’s not 100% clear we’re going to be able to do that.” By August 2015, Netflix 
had made considerable progress with its international expansion. It launched suc-
cessfully in Australia and New Zealand in March 2015 and had scheduled launches 
in Japan in the third quarter of 2015; Spain, Italy, and Portugal in the fourth quarter 
of 2015; and China in 2016. In addition to offering its U.S.-developed content glob-
ally, Netflix also developed Spanish content including Club de Cuervos and Narcos.
Unfortunately, the financial effect of its international expansion was mixed. Its sec-
ond quarter 2015 international revenue soared 48%; however its international net 
loss rose from $65 million to $92 million between the first and second quarters.
Investors were responding favorably, however—adding 100% to Netflix’s market 
capitalization between August 2014 and August 2015—moreover its stock rose 
55% between May and August.
A year after launching, Netflix was in 180 countries.
Netflix believed that offering the world a single, identical service would boost demand. 
As Elizabeth Bradley, Netflix’s chief of content acquisition argued, “The global library 
opens up huge new markets for filmmakers. For example, if Anime fans in Japan like 
certain kinds of Hollywood blockbusters, we can figure out which Anime films would 
do well with Americans watching the same blockbusters.”
Moreover, due to Netflix’s recommendation algorithms, Netflix expected to find 
global demand for specific kinds of content for small audiences in many different 
countries who shared common tastes. As Netflix’s chief product officer, Neil Hunt, 

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
70
said, “Every country has a wide range of taste. No one else is going to be able to find 
a niche audience that's not in Poland and is interested in a Polish story.”
Netflix’s second quarter 2016 financial report suggested that the company was 
struggling a bit in pursuit of its global growth goals. On July 18, Netflix posted a 33% 
increase in earnings and a 28% surge in revenues to $2.11 billion.
But investors were disappointed by the growth in its subscribers and subtracted 
about 13% from its stock market value the next day.
Netflix’s international subscribers are likely to surpass its U.S. ones by 2020. Netflix 
eventually expects to have 60 million to 90 million customers in the United States 
while Nomura forecasts that Netflix will “claim 88.7 million subscribers outside the 
U.S. by 2020,” according to Bloomberg.
But investors ignored that and focused on where Netflix fell short. In April 2016, 
Netflix predicted it would add two million overseas subscribers but reported 24% 
fewer than it had forecast. In a statement, Netflix also said it missed its projection of 
500,000 new U.S. subscribers by a whopping 68%—bringing the company’s total 
subscriber base to 83.2 million.
Some Netflix customers canceled their service. Hastings believes that those depart-
ing customers were upset when their bills increased by $1 or $2 a month.
But Hastings argued that “some members perceived the news as an impending new 
price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering [in higher 
new rates for older subscribers],” according to the statement.
Netflix faced a few challenges in international markets. Many of them were already 
populated by rivals with lower prices and localized content. For example, in India, 
Japan, and Poland Netflix is “in the early days of learning the best ways to satisfy 
users,” according to Bloomberg.
A cost of $7 or $8 a month was a high price to pay for many consumers in interna-
tional markets, but Sarandos had been investing in movies and TV shows to appeal 
to local tastes.
One other challenge Netflix faced was the rapid rise in costs that accompanied 
its acquisition of new content for all these international markets. After all, Netflix’s 
streaming content obligations rose from $10.1 billion to $13.2 in the second quarter 
of 2016 and its free cash flow was negative $254 million in the quarter, according 
to its statement.
Was its second quarter result a signal that its international strategy was failing or just 
a small speed bump on Netflix’s way to a leading position in global online streaming?
By January 2017, Netflix’s strong financial results suggested that its globalization 
strategy had been a success. It fourth quarter 2016 results featured 56% profit 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
71
growth and soaring subscriber counts—36% ahead of its forecasts—thanks to its 
successful expansion into 130 countries during 2016. And its stock price hit an all-
time high.1
Case Analysis
Netflix’s rapid global expansion modifies traditional approaches to growth 
from new geographies. Specifically, its success in pursuing its goal of operating 
in 200 countries highlights four key principles:
• 
Fit CEO skills with growth challenges. Hastings and 
his executive team shared clearly articulated goals and 
were flexible about how best to achieve them. Moreover, 
their previous success in turning Netflix from a DVD-by-
Mail service to an online streaming provider suggested 
that they were willing and able to reinvent the company 
to achieve growth goals.
• 
Reduce the CAGE distance between core mar-
ket and few bigger new ones. Netflix was selling its 
internally developed shows around the world—including 
some Spanish-language programs that were intended for 
Latin American markets.
• 
Accept wider CAGE distance between core mar-
ket and many smaller new ones. While tailoring the 
product to each country makes sense for markets with 
greater revenue potential, Netflix was also mindful of the 
marginal costs of such tailoring. To that end, it hoped 
to succeed in smaller markets that might be willing to 
accept English-language content with relatively minor 
amounts of tailoring to local culture.
• 
Learn from success and failure and adapt. Rather 
than spending months or years studying a potential strat-
egy, Netflix is willing to try growth strategies for new 
geographies and assess their effectiveness. In so doing, it 
can learn what works and what does not and modify its 
approach to achieve its long-term goals.

Unsuccessful: India Thwarts Apple’s Used iPhone 
Initiative
Introduction
Apple has a strong presence in India—in fiscal 2015 that amounted to $1 
billion in revenue (0.4% of its total), and India’s government was seeking to 
encourage Apple’s expansion there. However, in April 2016 an Apple initiative 
to boost iPhone sales there—by selling used iPhones in India at low prices—
backfired badly. And the factors underlying that outcome are instructive 
about the dangers of seeking to grow in new geographies where there is a 
wide CAGE distance between a company’s core geography and the new one.
Case Scenario
Apple’s attempt to sell used iPhones in India was first rejected in 2015. So Apple 
tried again in 2016 only to meet the same fate. When Apple applied to sell used 
iPhones in 2015, India’s environment ministry rejected Apple’s application “without 
much fanfare,” according to Bloomberg. However, by 2016 India had become more 
important to Apple thanks to a slowdown in China on which Apple had previously 
depended for most of its revenue growth. That left India, the second largest mobile 
market in the world, as “a vast untapped opportunity” in which Apple had “publicly 
talked up its prospects” and where it was “on course to get the green light to open 
its first retail stores,” Bloomberg reported.
Sadly for Apple, its urgent need to seek growth by expanding its presence in India 
was met by even stronger opposition from India-based rivals who rallied around 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India program to encourage local manu-
facturing. Those executives warned Modi that letting Apple sell used iPhones in 
India would “open the floodgates to electronic waste, jeopardize local players, and 
make a farce of [his] Make in India program.” Sudhir Hasija, chairman of Karbonn 
Mobiles said his company sold about 1.7 million phones a month—giving him ample 
economic incentive to warn that letting Apple sell used iPhones would turn “Make in 
India into Dump in India.”
Apple also faced opposition from India’s Mobile and Communications Council 
(MCC)—a lobbyist for Indian phone brands that included Micromax, Intex, and 
Samsung. MCC’s chairman Ravinder Zutshi told Bloomberg, “Why even consider 
allowing import of used phones when import of other used goods such as cars are 
precluded by 300 percent duty levies?” Apple’s application went into a governmental 
process known as inter-ministerial discussion—the outcome of which was uncertain 
but seemed to favor the vocal Indian opposition to Apple.
The price competition for smart phones in India was intense. Eighty percent of such 
phones sold in India were priced no higher than $150—and branded smartphone 
prices could drop as low as $35.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
73
At the time, Apple’s market share in India was less than 2% and in March 2016, Apple 
introduced a lower priced phone—the iPhone SE with a starting price of $399—
that was still too expensive to make a dent in the Indian market. Nevertheless, 
Apple enjoyed a whopping 76% rise in its Indian sales in the holiday quarter, which 
inspired CEO Tim Cook to comment on India’s “incredibly exciting” prospects. Selling 
refurbished iPhones would likely enable Apple to drop its prices and earn a profit in 
India’s smartphone market.
Yet local rivals were arguing ferociously to the Indian government that allowing Apple 
to pursue this strategy would lead to “a deluge of used electronics imports, mak-
ing mince-meat of Modi’s localization drive,” noted Bloomberg. Apple rivals also 
criticized the company’s refurbished phone strategy because it would create toxic 
waste—in the form of used batteries and LCD screens—which India would not be 
able to dispose of effectively.
In its application Apple offered to set up facilities to handle the toxic waste—it 
typically managed to collect and recycle 85 percent, by weight, of devices produced 
seven years earlier, according to Bloomberg. And its India refurbishment proposal 
would give Apple something to do with the roughly 15 million older U.S. iPhones that 
it expected to receive as part of a trade-in program it offered customers in exchange 
for a “small monthly fee.” Sudhir Hasija, chairman of Karbonn Mobile, an Indian 
smartphone maker, believed that Apple represented a threat to its business even 
above the top-of-the-line-for-India-price of $150. “Even if the refurbished iPhones 
are priced a bit more than 10,000 rupees ($150), that will hurt our sales because 
Indians may choose Apple for its snob value,” he told Bloomberg.
By July 2016, Apple’s efforts to sell refurbished iPhones there were in limbo as were 
plans to set up Apple stores there. As for opening Apple stores in India, the govern-
ment sent mixed signals. In June 2016, India approved Apple’s application to oper-
ate stores in India. The seemingly good news was that since the Indian government 
appeared to consider that Apple sold “cutting-edge” products and “state-of-the-art: 
technology, it would be exempt from a so-called local content requirement for three 
years—after which Apple would need to sell products containing at least 30% so-
called local content.
Apple’s confusion was understandable—after all, under India’s original rules, Apple 
had been invited to build its stores in India free of the local content requirement and 
it was unclear what was required to comply with that provision. Moreover, different 
parts of India’s government came to different conclusions about whether Apple sold 
cutting-edge products—the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) said 
it did, but the Foreign Investment Promotion Board disagreed. Apple did not want to 
invest until these issues were cleared up. A source told Economic Times, “There is 
a certain opaqueness regarding the rules. In addition, the company does not want to 
commit to complying with local sourcing requirements. It can only start manufactur-
ing in or begin sourcing from India once it attains a certain scale of business which 
is difficult to estimate right now.”

Case Analysis
While it remains to be seen whether Apple’s efforts to gain market share in 
India will succeed or fail, its lack of progress in 2015 and 2016 reveal three 
reasons that large companies often fail when they seek faster growth from 
new geographies.
Unrealistically high expectations for successful market penetration. 
Apple was facing severe pressure from investors to maintain its thirteen-year 
streak of quarterly revenue growth. But it suffered a serious reversal due its 
excessive dependence on iPhone sales from China—which fell significantly 
and put pressure on Cook to find a new source of growth to replace its 
declining China revenues. Yet Apple’s need to penetrate the Indian market 
quickly was incompatible with the realities of the Indian smartphone industry.
Superficial grasp of CAGE distance. Apple demonstrated that it had 
some understanding of how to apply for a license to enter the Indian mar-
ket—both for Apple stores and for selling refurbished iPhones. Yet Apple 
appears not to have grasped that Indian smartphone companies would use 
their influence with the government to block Apple’s efforts—or at least try 
to delay them considerably.
Unwillingness to take uncomfortable steps required to overcome 
challenges. Bribery is common in Indian business. An Ernst & Young survey 
found that 25% to 50% of respondents in the technology industry found that 
India was corrupt—meaning that bribery was part of doing business. The U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had extracted fines as high as in 
the tens of millions of dollars from a wide variety of companies for alleged 
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Was Apple willing to 
find a way to do business in such a corrupt environment? If not, perhaps it 
should have considered a different country from which to seek growth.

■Principle Three  Small companies seeking growth from current geographies should find and 
market to customers who value their products’ superior attributes.
Small companies pursuing growth within their current geography should use 
different approaches depending on whether they sell to and service with their 
customers in person or via machine. If small companies interact in person 
with their customers, then success depends on picking new locations that will 
have the same characteristics as the stores where the company is currently 
enjoying the most profitability and growth. If the company interacts with cus-
tomers online or wirelessly, it can expand geographically without investing in 
new physical locations.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
75
In either case, small companies face unique challenges when they contemplate 
expanding within their current geography. Specifically, they ought to apply the 
following principles:
• 
Work out the kinks in current geography before 
expanding. Small companies must experiment with their 
current locations until they become successful—either 
profitable or at least cash-flow neutral—before seek-
ing to expand. After all, a company could burn through 
its capital if it replicates a cash-flow consuming business 
model in more locations. Moreover, once the small com-
pany reaches that goal, it should understand the reasons 
for its success—such as competitively superior ways that 
the company markets, operates, and services customers.
• 
Research new locations rigorously. If the small com-
pany intends to expand into new locations, it should 
approach the process in a rigorous way. If the company 
offers a service to consumers, it should locate where 
many of those consumers are likely to find it convenient. 
The company ought to analyze the specific factors that 
make a location convenient for the consumers it wants to 
serve and pick locations that best fit with those factors.
• 
Overestimate resources required to expand. Unless 
a company’s executive team has prior experience opening 
up new retail locations, it may be difficult to estimate the 
capital and management attention required to make new 
locations successful. Therefore, companies should con-
sider doubling their initial estimate for the resources that 
will be required to expand into new locations.
• 
Measure obsessively and respond to feedback in 
new locations. Finally, once a company has opened new 
locations, it ought to measure their performance and adjust 
based on results. Companies might consider measuring 
factors such as customer traffic, customer wait times, and 
capacity utilization by hour and by day of the week in addi-
tion to the location’s growth, profitability, and cash flow.
Successful: MiniLuxe Expands Nationally
Introduction
Boston-based nail salon chain, MiniLuxe, raised $25 million in 2015 to expand 
nationally thanks to the popularity of its higher-quality operations. At the 
core of MiniLuxe’s success was a radical rethinking of how a nail salon might 

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
76
be operated in order to provide a better customer and employee experience 
that would boost prices, employee loyalty and productivity, and store cash 
flow. Moreover, MiniLuxe’s geographic expansion flowed successfully from tak-
ing a rigorous approach to selecting new locations.
Case Scenario
The idea for MiniLuxe came from John Hamel, a general partner at Boston-based 
venture capital firm, CueBall. Hamel was no expert on manicures—but he had been 
given a challenge and he realized that nail salons could be a way to address it. In 2007, 
Cue Ball CEO, Tony Tjan, challenged his partners “to find a highly fragmented industry 
that could do what Starbucks did for the coffee shop: use a combination of smart 
design, systems and company culture to create a following,” according to the New 
York Times. Hamel was driving through his hometown of Revere, Massachusetts, and 
noticed five nail salons near each other in the same strip mall.
When he first walked into a nail salon, Hamel—who had been a consultant with 
AnswerThink—was struck by the strong smell of nail polish. But the smell of acrylics 
was just one of many problems Hamel discovered with the typical nail salon. Hamel 
was most disturbed by the filth in the foot tubs used to provide pedicures. He learned 
that these tubs had jets that were impossible to clean. He also found many hygiene 
problems—manicurists reuse tools that are not properly sterilized and the people 
who perform the waxing double-dip the swabs they use to pull out hair. If that is 
not bad enough, scheduling was not done or not done reliably and the fluorescent 
lighting was unappealing.
CueBall also learned that nail salons mistreated their workers and wanted to create 
a company that would do better. How badly? According to a Nails Magazine survey, 
“35% of nail workers cannot remember the last time they had a vacation, and 12% 
earned less than $150 a week.”
Hamel realized that Cue Ball could do to the U.S. nail salon industry—which con-
sisted of 65,000 salons generating $10 billion in annual sales—what Starbucks had 
done to the coffee shop business.
Hamel and his partner Mats Lederhausen—who had been managing director 
of McDonald’s Ventures and had overseen investments in Chipotle Mexican Grill, 
Boston Market, Pret a Manger, and Redbox DVD—were among CueBall executives 
who saw an opportunity to develop a “systems approach to nails,” according to 
the New York Times. They rethought how a nail salon would operate—including 
activities like hiring and training, cleaning, product development, scheduling to match 
the supply of manicurists to customer demand, measuring store performance, and 
picking store locations.
MiniLuxe believed that happy employees made happy customers. So it invested 
in training, scheduling, and developing the careers of employees. By January 2015, 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
77
MiniLuxe had about 200 part- and full-time employees, all of whom had “company 
health insurance, paid time off, profit-sharing and a company 401(k),” according to 
the New York Times. MiniLuxe kept its tools cleaner than did the typical nail salon. 
As Tjan wrote, MiniLuxe “uses medical grade autoclaving equipment (a sterilization 
process for the instrumentation) and exposes that process through a glass ‘clean lab’ 
where clients can see the tools being sanitized and sterilized. That is a unique pro-
cess and asset in the nail salon world.” What’s more, MiniLuxe’s foot tubs were free 
of the jets that Hamel found impossible to clean. And in 2014, MiniLuxe introduced 
its own nearly toxin-free polish and uses it along with popular brands.
The higher quality made it possible for MiniLuxe to charge $20 for a manicure and 
$39 for a pedicure “slightly more than a typical strip-mall nail salon, but less than a 
spa for comparable services,” according to the New York Times. MiniLuxe hired a 
data scientist to handle scheduling so that customers would not have to wait after 
they walked in to a salon and technicians would not be idle. A key insight was that 
walk-in traffic rises 5% for every 10-degree increase in temperature but rain does 
not reduce traffic. MiniLuxe also operated an always-on online booking service, intro-
duced a mobile app to buzz users’ phones when it was their turn for a service, and 
was testing apps to share scheduling and client preference details with employees. 
MiniLuxe had its own way of measuring how well its stores were doing. As Tjan 
explained, it used a “Net Promoter Score—a measure of how likely a client would 
be to recommend the service to another person; weekly sales growth compared to 
the previous year; time to positive cash flow in a new location; and sales per square 
foot.” Finally, MiniLuxe had a rigorous process for picking locations that used data 
from its stores to map out suitable spots. But at the beginning, Hamel looked online 
at Massachusetts Starbucks locations, counted the number of nail salons within a 
half mile to one-and-a-half mile radius and sought space for MiniLuxe in whichever 
“had the most density,” he told the New York Times.
By January 2015, MiniLuxe had eight locations in the Boston area, had $23 million 
in venture capital, and was preparing to expand nationally—including eight salons 
in and around Dallas. When MinLuxe moved to Dallas in February 2015, it told a 
local newspaper that it had picked the city due to the “Pedicure Index—the number 
of days above a certain temperature, and therefore sandal weather.”
By July 2016, MiniLuxe had raised another $7.5 million from investors. With 15 
stores it was planning to expand to Los Angeles. MiniLuxe’s locations throughout 
Texas had done well and Tjan was looking for more locations where there was 
“a stronger cultural emphasis on grooming and warmer weather where open-toed 
shoes are more popular”—creating more demand for pedicures. Could MiniLuxe 
go national or would it be too difficult to provide consistently high quality service 
nationwide?

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies

Case Analysis
The MiniLuxe case illustrates two useful principles for small company CEOs 
seeking to expand into new geographies:
• 
Work out the kinks in the business model before 
expanding. MiniLuxe had extraordinary patience in tak-
ing about seven years to build its presence in the Boston 
area before raising capital for expansion to Dallas in 2015 
and a planned move to Los Angeles in 2017. The apparent 
success of its Dallas expansion suggests that MiniLuxe’s 
patience was wise.
• 
Make sure the strategy from your current loca-
tion works in new ones. Consumers were willing to 
pay a higher price because MiniLuxe performed key activ-
ities—including human resources management, cleaning, 
scheduling, performance measurement, and choosing 
locations—in a competitively superior manner. This 
strategy worked in Boston and Dallas—and MiniLuxe 
was hoping it would translate well to Los Angeles.
Unsuccessful: Pacific Sunwear’s Slow  
Motion Wipeout
Introduction
Anaheim, California-based surf retailer, Pacific Sunwear of California (PacSun), 
filed for bankruptcy in April 2016 after 36 years. Its failure flowed from a 
poorly conceived and executed 2005 plan to expand by 40% its U.S. store 
count and its lack of responsiveness to changing fashion trends.
By 2016, its shareholders were wiped out as its revenues plunged 40% from 
their $1.4 billion high. Its shares fell 96% in the year ending April 8, 2016.
Case Scenario
In retrospect PacSun’s problems started when the demand for products related 
to surfing and extreme sports was at its peak. In 2005, brands such as Quiksilver, 
Billabong, and PacSun—whose Roxy and Hurley labels were popular with mall-going 
teens—were flying high and PacSun’s shares peaked. That year, it operated nearly 
1,000 stores across America and PacSun executives announced plans to boost that 
number by 400 within three years—many of these stores ended up underperform-
ing and had rent costs that were above market price. That 40% increase in store 
count coincided with turmoil at the top for PacSun.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
79
The executive behind that increase in store count was Seth Johnson—a Yale graduate 
with an MBA from the University of Chicago—who had been chief operating officer 
at Abercrombie & Fitch where he helped launch Abercrombie's popular Hollister 
stores in 2000. Johnson was brought in as PacSun’s COO in 2004 by then-CEO Greg 
Weaver and was promoted to CEO in April 2005.And Johnson’s geographic expan-
sion plans were indeed very ambitious. In February 2006, PacSun planned
• 
To open 600 to 800 One Thousand Steps shoe stores for 18- 
to 24-year-olds (noting that Weaver “thought we could have a 
great [shoe store] business”);
• 
To expand from 907 to 1,000 the number of PacSun stores—
that sold surf and skate clothing and accessories store target-
ing shoppers ages 12 to 18; and
• 
Increase from 198 to 400 the number of d.e.m.o. stores—
which sold hip-hop clothing and accessories store targeting 
shoppers aged 16 to 24.
Johnson appeared very confident of the success of his strategy for geographic expan-
sion based on his belief that PacSun could expand into big malls. “There's no reason 
for us to do a new concept unless it can be in a lot of malls. We're a big business now, 
and to add meaningful growth, we do have to be able to contribute a lot of volume 
and profit,” he said. Johnson also wanted to build bigger stores. “The Galleria at Tyler 
store is 9,000 square feet. It was a little over 5,000 before. We added some home 
products, accessories and shoes. Our average store today is 3,600 square feet. We 
could easily have several hundred stores that could be 5,000 to 6,000,” he contin-
ued. Johnson believed that PacSun was successful and did not need fixing. But under 
Johnson, total company same-store sales for the third quarter of 2006 declined 2.4%, 
PacSun sales were down 1.2%, and d.e.m.o. same-store sales plunged 9.4%.
In October 2006, PacSun’s board allowed Johnson to “resign to pursue other inter-
ests” and installed Sally Frame Kasaks, former CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch, Ann 
Taylor, and Talbots to “win back teens lost to such stores as Hollister and Zumiez,” 
according to Bloomberg. Kasaks’s plan—to shut money-losing stores and transform 
PacSun to a destination for “Southern California cool-girls” with private-label clothes 
and rival surf brands—flopped due to its plethora of money-losing stores.
In 2009, former Vans CEO Gary Shoenfeld replaced Kasak. In 2011, Shoenfeld 
began closing 200 stores and in 2012 tried to get girls excited about its stores by 
signing Kendall and Kylie Jenner to sell fashion for juniors. This strategy also failed. 
With foot traffic in malls down, PacSun had closed 40% of its stores—leaving it with 
593 stores and 2,000 full time employees—and its revenue had fallen 40% from its 
2005 peak to $800 million by the end of 2015.
In April 2016, San Francisco private equity firm Golden Gate Capital took over PacSun 
by converting most of its 65% share of PacSun debt into equity. Josh Olshansky, 
­managing director at Golden Gate Capital, sounded (perhaps unrealistically) optimis-
tic about PacSun’s future. “PacSun has successfully transitioned beyond its historical 

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
80
base of action sports brands to what we believe is the most relevant and coveted mix 
of brands celebrating the California lifestyle,” Olshansky said in a statement.
Beachside brands Quiksilver and Wet Seal also overexpanded and filed for bank-
ruptcy. They cut their retail store count and tried to boost revenues by selling their 
more popular brands online. PacSun—still with Schoenfeld as CEO—may follow 
suit—shifting from surf brands—which were out of favor with teens to “California 
casual gear, such labels as Brandy Melville, LA Hearts, and Kendall + Kylie,” noted 
Bloomberg.
Case Analysis
PacSun’s bankruptcy highlights important principles about what to avoid in 
seeking growth by expanding within a company’s current geography. Specifically, 
PacSun’s geographic expansion resulted from three failure principles:
• 
Follow in the previous CEO’s footprints. A new 
CEO may feel gratitude toward his predecessor. And 
that gratitude might encourage the new CEO to pursue 
a strategy set in motion before he arrived there. Johnson 
seems to have taken this approach in launching a shoe 
store chain at PacSun. Most industries change rapidly and 
basing strategies on what a retired CEO did could lead to 
investments that do not generate a return.
• 
Invest heavily at the market’s peak. PacSun’s geo-
graphic expansion came at what was in retrospect the 
peak of the surf-wear trend—which was boosting 
demand for all the leading industry participants. PacSun’s 
ambitious expansion strategy was based more on a fear 
of falling behind competitors rather than an objective 
assessment of whether its investment in additional supply 
would be met with a greater increase in demand.
• 
Ignore changing competitive landscape and con-
sumer trends. PacSun’s expansion took place under the 
direction of a new CEO whose previous success building 
Hollister may have caused the company to avoid look-
ing for reasons not to do what he wanted. As a result, 
PacSun invested in expansion before conducting objec-
tive analysis of the changing competitive landscape and 
evolving fashion trends among its customers. As a result, 
PacSun expanded geographically with a business strategy 
that appealed to an ever-shrinking group of customers.

■Principle Four  Small companies seeking growth from new geographies should market to 
customers in new locations with low CAGE distance who value their superior product attributes.
The risk of geographic expansion is highest for small companies that open 
shop in new countries. How can small company CEOs make a compelling case 
to their investors that the benefits of such geographic expansion are comfort-
ably greater than the risks? The cases that follow suggest that small company 
CEOs can boost their odds that expanding into new geographies will lead to 
faster revenue growth if they follow four principles:
• 
Be humble. As we first discussed in Chapter 1, a company 
whose CEO seeks to impose his world view on customers 
will rarely succeed. To develop and implement a success-
ful growth strategy, a company’s CEO must be intellectually 
humble—that means a willingness to assume that what has 
worked in the past will not help in the future. Intellectual 
humility means that the CEO will form a hypothesis, gather 
data, and use the analysis of the data to make a better strategy.
• 
Minimize CAGE distance. Such as CEO should 
start off by narrowing down the countries to which the 
company ought to expand. Potential countries could be 
ranked based on factors such as their potential revenue 
for your industry, their CAGE distance from your home 
country, the investment required to begin selling there, 
and how long it might take to generate revenues.
• 
Find customer pain in those countries. Next, the 
CEO should meet with potential customers in new 
countries and ask them what factors the use to evaluated 
competing suppliers of the product, how well they think 
those suppliers perform on the factors, and whether 
they have unmet needs that the company could satisfy.
• 
Apply your strengths to alleviate customer pain. 
If many of those customers indicate interest in your 
product, let them try it out for a while—or if that’s not 
possible, encourage them to speak with current satisfied 
customers in your company’s home country. After the 
product trials or conversations with reference custom-
ers, ask the potential customer what they think about 
the product. If the customer finds the product interest-
ing—it’s bad news for expanding to the country. If the 
customer asks how soon you can deliver, there is reason 
for optimism.

Successful: Critical Software Goes International
Introduction
Coimbra, Portugal-based software provider Critical Software (CS) used inter-
nally generated capital to expand from Portugal to Brazil and Mozambique. 
Even as Portugal was in the midst of an IMF bailout in 2011, CS was expecting 
to boost its hiring by 40% in 2012 to satisfy the needs of customers in new 
countries where it was expanding.
Case Scenario
CS helps companies alleviate a major source of pain—their technology cannot adapt 
quickly enough to changes in their business. For example, a company wants to get 
a new product to market quickly to keep up with a more aggressive competitor, but 
it cannot get its IT department to build the systems needed to support that new 
product as quickly as it can design and produce the new product.
CEO Goncalo Quadros explained to me in 2011 that CS alleviates that client pain. 
According to Quadros, CS clients want “Partners capable of delivering reliable solutions, 
taking proper advantage of state-of-the-art technology, within the right time-frame, at 
the right cost. That’s what we deliver.”
CS works with companies and with governments. One of the more interesting CS 
projects was its work improving the Portuguese Emergency Management System 
(people dial 112 to get the service there). Before CS’s involvement, the 112 system 
merely took calls and forwarded them. To that, CS added enhancements—closing 
the loop from reporting to managing the resolution of the emergency.
CS was founded in 1998 by three PhD students from the University of Coimbra, a 
few hours north of Portugal’s capital Lisbon. Their research work aimed at reducing 
the development cost of mission critical systems by combining software technologies 
with commercial off-the-shelf components.
While mission critical systems were typically only found in very critical domains, such 
as aerospace and defense, they thought there would be an opportunity to use that 
approach to address the problems of business critical applications in other industries 
such as manufacturing, finance, health care, and energy.
CS had ambitious goals. Between 2011 and 2014 it wanted to operate seven com-
panies in the group generating $120 million in sales and pretax profit of $24 million. 
And it sought to increase its employee base from 250 to 350 and establish new 
subsidiaries, in addition to its existing units in the United States, United Kingdom, 
Brazil, Angola, and Mozambique.
CS was in Mozambique—a Portuguese trading partner and colony from 1498 to 
1975—as far back as 2008. In October 2008, CS signed three contracts with compa-
nies in Mozambique—two with its telecommunications company, Telecomunicações 
de Moçambique; and one with a government agency, the Maputo Municipal Council.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
83
By July 2015, CS’s presence in Mozambique continued to generate compelling growth 
opportunities. Certainly, CS’s people appreciated the country’s culture. According to 
CS, “In Maputo, the capital city of Mozambique, life is colorful. Not only do CS 
employees enjoy a buzzing metropolis, beautiful scenery and exciting food, we are 
also challenged with interesting, high-profile projects across a broad range of indus-
tries.” These projects included helping the government build an “off-grid photovoltaic 
power generation” capability and an IT training program for bank employees. In 
2011, revenue increased 15% to about $20 million—with most of the growth  
coming from international expansion—in 2011 CS’s operations in the United 
Kingdom, Brazil, the United States, and Mozambique grew by roughly 45%.
Between 2011 and 2016, CS underwent some turmoil at the top but ended up 
achieving significant growth as it expanded globally. In January 2012, CS appointed 
Marco Costa—who started as an intern at CS in 2000 and earned a MSc in 
Computer Engineering, and an MBA from the INSEAD—as its new CEO with 
Quadros becoming CS’s chairman.
Quadros was excited about the change represented by Costa’s appointment. “Change 
is an essential pillar in CS’s culture—it brings us plurality, ambition and determination, 
but also intelligence, demand and merit. Marco is an extremely capable manager, in 
whom we place all our trust and he can depend on all the human capital, knowledge 
and experience that makes CS what it is today,” Quadros explained.
But Costa appears to have fallen short of CS's expectations. About 30 months 
later, Quadros returned as CS’s CEO and Costa was gone. Quadros’s reinstatement 
resulted from “a year-long analysis carried out by the Board of Directors, taking 
into account the company’s strategic, organizational and cultural goals.” CS’s board 
concluded that Quadros had “the necessary charisma, energy, experience and knowl-
edge of the organization required to successfully implement” an ambitious strategy 
to boost the company’s growth. Quadros’s return as CEO contributed to a record 
year for CS. In 2015, the company “grew its annual global turnover by 12% to 
€26 million for the year. Most impressively, as a measure of profitability, year-on-
year [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] EBITDA grew 
by 77% to €3.9m, and [earnings before taxes] EBT rose to €2.5m, up 178% on 
the previous year’s results.” The strong financial performance flowed from “further 
growth in European and North American markets, while growth in “energy, financial 
services and space—which increased threefold,” were also important contributors.
Case Analysis
CS’s continued growth—despite the limited capital markets in Portugal—
reflected the application of its strengths to customers in geographies with 
relatively narrow CAGE distance from Coimbra, Portugal. Key principles for 
CS’s successful expansion into new geographies include the following:
• 
Minimize CAGE distance. CS chose new geogra-
phies that were culturally, if not geographically, close 
to Portugal. Although much of its growth came from 

Chapter 3 | Growth via New or Current Geographies
84
­providing ­services to customers in the United States 
and the United Kingdom—with slightly more cultural 
distance from Coimbra—its decision to target Brazil 
and Mozambique suggest that it realized that as former 
Portuguese colonies, these countries had even shorter 
CAGE distance.
• 
Match your strengths against unmet customer 
needs. Due to CS’s expertise in building systems that 
support critical operations in specific industries, it was 
able to win contracts among customers who had those 
problems in new geographies. Its geographic expansion 
strategy was built on a two-phased growth trajectory—
first develop world-class expertise in solving specific 
problems, the solution of which customers are willing to 
pay a high price and then find new geographies where 
customers are seeking such solutions.
Unsuccessful: Sweden’s Rdio Loses to Spotify
Introduction
Rdio, a San Francisco-based music streaming service started by the found-
ers of Skype in August 2008, launched its service to the U.S. market in 2011, 
raised nearly $126 million in capital in six rounds, went bankrupt in 2015 and 
was acquired by Pandora Media for $75 million that December. Although it 
enjoyed a year head start over Stockholm, Sweden-based Spotify, Rdio suf-
fered significant competitive disadvantages and ultimately stumbled to its 
demise. One simple reason Rdio failed was that it charged users a monthly 
fee whereas Spotify let users stream music for free when it launched in the 
United States in 2012.
Case Scenario
Rdio was founded by Skype’s cofounders Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstroem. Friis was 
the most directly involved and “was thought to have invested more than $200 million 
in Rdio. In 2013, Rdio struck a deal with U.S. radio giant Cumulus, trading 15% of its 
equity for $75 million in radio advertising, that valued the company at $500 million 
In early November 2015, Cumulus revealed to investors that it had taken a $19.4 
million write-down on its equity in Rdio,” according to Variety.
But Rdio’s most significant competitive disadvantage was that its CEO did not appre-
ciate the importance of marketing whereas Spotify’s CEO was a marketing whiz. 
Rdio felt an urgent need to become profitable before it had become a dominant 
supplier. Spotify invested heavily in getting to be the biggest fast.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
85
The result was a huge market share advantage for Spotify. Rdio was the first modern 
music streaming service to arrive in America. In August 2010, Rdio offered a $5 Web-
only streaming service because smartphones were not ubiquitous. Rdio offered 7 million 
songs, which was far fewer than the 30 million that its rivals provided by November 
2015. Between its care in designing a user interface—including features such as a 
“calming blue-and-white design and a simple grid of album artwork”—and its negotia-
tions of content deals, Rdio took two years to launch its service, according to The Verge.
Rdio tried to grow through social networking—the idea that friends would listen to 
the songs that their friends liked the most. Chris Becherer, Rdio’s head of product 
told The Verge, "The founding premise was the best music recommendations come 
from the people you know. That was the whole idea." Rdio lost because that strategy 
was less effective than that of Spotify, “a cunning and well-financed competitor that 
excelled at generating buzz—and using that buzz to acquire paid subscribers.”
Spotify’s buzz started just as Rdio was gaining early customers from San Franciscans 
who appreciated Rdio’s design. Sadly for Rdio, Spotify was generating much more 
enthusiasm as Americans saw its free-with-advertising business model as “free 
iTunes.” While Spotify launched and gained many users quickly, Rdio struggled to 
explain why people should pay for the service and it lacked marketing leadership—
unable to retain a chief marketing officer for more than a few months.
Rdio also spent R&D funds on features that did not boost its market share. For 
example, Rdio took too long refining what it called its queue—where users could 
store music for later listening. The problem was that customers did not care about 
this feature as much as others, which Rdio neglected to develop.
By 2013, a year after launching, Spotify had 24 million users, 6 million of whom paid. 
Rdio was unable to grow and sold an equity stake to Cumulus Media, which operated 
525 terrestrial radio stations, which began selling advertisements for Rdio. Rdio was 
five years behind Spotify—which had been offering a free-advertising-supported 
service since 2008. Rdio CEO Drew Larner resigned in June 2013 right before the 
Cumulus deal was announced. Rdio’s survival also was threatened by its inability to 
fix the inherently low profitability of the streaming music industry. Record labels leave 
only a sliver of revenue for the streaming services. Spotify raised $1 billion under the 
premise that it could spend heavily to add subscribers with the hope that it would be 
able to generate enough advertising revenue to become profitable.
By November 2015, Spotify had over 75 million users and 20 million paid users, yet 
it remained unprofitable. Rdio built finely crafted apps for a small group of “snobby 
album purists” who were not willing to pay a high enough price to keep it in business. 
Rdio’s collapse reflects a common pattern of failure. A founding team tries to apply 
the same skills that led to its initial success when it starts a different business. The 
skills that made the first business a success do not help the new business succeed. 
But the company founders ignore what customers want and dismiss the strategies 
of faster-growing rivals. The key to Skype is that it is free and the marginal cost of 
production is zero. Skype runs directory servers that connect users who then com-
municate peer-to-peer. Unlike a phone company, Skype does not carry the traffic

from point a to point b. This strategy did not work with Rdio because there was a 
marginal cost of service delivery—the royalty to the artist. The founders wanted to 
fund this with a subscription model, which stunted Rdio's growth. Spotify chose an 
advertising based model with an upgrade to an ad-free subscription-based model. 
Despite the growth, they did not achieve sufficient economies of scale to lower their 
costs below their revenues.
Case Analysis
Here are three principles that lead to failure when a small company expands 
into a new geography:
• 
Failure to analyze differences between core and 
new geography. Rdio’s cofounders built Skype into the 
dominant voice-over-Internet-protocol service. At the 
core of its success was technical excellence that yielded 
near-global scope and good quality using a freemium  
pricing model. However, when Rdio opened a music stream-
ing service, it failed to realize that technical skills would not 
make the difference between winning and perishing.
• 
Not listening to customers. Rdio built a service that 
would appeal to its founders—who assumed that if they 
liked it, the vast American audience would share their 
passion for the product. Since Rdio’s founders did not 
listen to American consumers, they did not realize that a 
free service would appear to be an irresistible value.
• 
Unwillingness to learn from more successful com-
petitors. Though Rdio had a year head start over Spotify, 
it quickly fell behind because of its failure to recognize 
that consumers preferred its rival’s free-with-advertising 
business model. Rdio was five years too late in replicating 
Spotify’s service. That was too late to survive.
Applying the Principles of Growth through 
Geography
Leaders seeking to assess whether they apply these principles to their organi-
zations should address these six questions:
• 
How much has your company saturated the growth 
potential of its current geographies?
• 
Which new geographies have the most growth potential 
for your company?

Disciplined Growth Strategies
87
• 
Can your company manage the challenges presented by 
the CAGE distance between its current geographies and 
the new ones?
• 
Does your company understand how it will provide more 
value to customers than competitors do in these new 
geographies?
• 
Has your company contracted profitable arrangements 
for manufacturing and distributing your product in these 
new geographies?
• 
Have you appointed effective executives to lead your 
expansion into new geographies?
Chapter 8: Growth Road Maps provides a detailed methodology for applying 
the principles of growth through new products.
Summary
Speeding up growth by selling to current or new geographies is a very com-
mon source of growth. The cases we’ve analyzed in this chapter reveal that 
success in geographic expansion strategies depends on providing potential 
customers with a better value than competitors do. We also saw that a com-
mon error among companies expanding into new geographies is to equate a 
country’s population with its attractiveness as a market for the company. To 
avoid that mistake, CEOs need to consider different factors—including the 
potential revenues for the company and its peers, whether those revenues 
will grow and why, whether the company can offer such a compelling value 
to customers that it will be able to grow faster than the market, and whether 
the CAGE distance is short enough between that country and the company’s 
home market.
In the next chapter, we explore a third growth vector—building or acquiring 
new products—which forces leaders to confront a different set of challenges.

Growth via 
Building or 
Acquiring New 
Products
In Chapter 1, we introduced the concept of S-curves. If a company finds itself 
too dependent on a downward sloping S-Curve, its hope for resuming growth 
depends on getting itself onto a new S-Curve that is just beginning to slope 
upwards. To accomplish that aim, companies can either build or acquire new 
products.
Principles Of Growth from New Products
In this chapter we will explore the principles that distinguish the successful 
builders or acquirers from their peers. In both cases, CEOs who are open-
minded and who make decisions based on analysis of data prevail over those 
who assume that approaches that worked for them in the past will work 
equally well for the immediate challenges they must face.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
90
CEOs who build or acquire new products successfully start the process by 
identifying customers who are likely to buy the new products. Such CEOs 
listen to those customers to understand their pain—and to focus on a vision 
for a product that would relieve that customer pain more effectively than 
competing products do.
There are some key differences that distinguish successful new product 
builders from new product acquirers. CEOs who lead the development 
of successful new products are good at managing the process of building  
rapid prototypes of new products and sharing them with potential customers  
to get their feedback on what works, what does not work, and what  
is missing from the prototype. Through such learning, CEOs improve the 
prototype and identify the need to add new skills to the company—in areas 
such as sales, technology, purchasing, distribution, or manufacturing—so it 
can win and keep new customers of the new product.
Less successful product builders focus on building what the CEO believes 
customers want and pushing to complete the product development quickly 
and without feedback from customers. This approach depletes a company's 
resources by building a product that customers are reluctant to buy. When 
small companies take this approach, they often run out of money and cease 
operations or find an acquirer.
CEOs who achieve growth through acquiring new products realize that they 
must manage the acquisition of a company—not just a product. In so doing, 
those CEOs must do two things well:
• 
Analyze whether the acquisition makes sense, and
• 
Manage the integration of the two companies well.
Picking the right company to acquire hinges on analyzing whether the com-
pany participates in a fast-growing, profitable industry; whether the combined 
companies will have the products and skills needed to gain market share; 
whether the price the acquirer pays is low enough to ensure an adequate 
return on the investment; and whether it will be possible to integrate the two 
companies so that customers of the acquired company do not suffer once the 
deal closes.
CEOs who manage the integration well start off by running their companies 
with a clearly defined culture. Such a culture has specific and well-articulated 
values and puts those values into practice when they hire, promote, and man-
age people out of the company. Such CEOs also spend time with the key 
people in the target company to make sure they fit with their company’s cul-
ture; work closely with those key people to knit together the two companies’ 
products and skills; and tie the awarding of stock to achievement of specific 
milestones that will boost the value of the combined company.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
91
CEOs who fail at acquiring for growth make up their minds about doing a deal, 
skimp on analyzing whether it makes sense, speed through the due diligence, 
and lose interest after the deal is done—delegating the integration to subor-
dinates and mentally checking out of the process thereafter.
In the remainder of this chapter, we examine case studies to illustrate four 
principles of growth through new products:
• 
Large companies seeking growth from designing 
new products should create, market, and service products 
that beat competitors on customers’ top-ranked purchase 
criteria.
• 
Large companies seeking growth from acquiring 
new products should make acquisitions that pass indus-
try attractiveness, better off, NPV > 0, and integration 
tests.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from designing 
new products should extend product features to gain a 
larger share of their customer’s wallets.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from acquir-
ing new products should only invest in products that 
uniquely relieve “customers’ pain points” when combined 
with the acquirer’s capabilities at a price that does not 
capitalize future gains.
■
■Principle One  Large companies seeking growth from designing new products should create, 
market, and improve products that beat competitors on customers’ top-ranked purchase criteria.
Case Studies
There are many ways to think about how to manage a large company. It is 
common for large companies—especially publicly traded ones—to hire CEOs 
with strong financial skills who focus on winning at the popular Wall Street 
game I call Beat and Raise. The rules of this game are simple to describe—
each quarter a company should exceed Wall Street expectations for revenue 
and profit growth while boosting its forecast for the next quarter. To win at 
Beat and Raise, CEOs seek to milk as much growth as they can from current 
products while avoiding expensive bets in the future that might take the com-
pany off the quarterly path to Beat and Raise victory.
Another way to run a large company is to think of it as a start-up with more 
resources. In this model, the CEO is an entrepreneur with a passion for see-
ing the future and getting there ahead of rivals. In so doing, the CEO pays 

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
92
close attention to what is bothering customers, analyzes the strategies of 
faster-growing rivals, and invests in new products that will create new growth 
opportunities while solving the problems bothering customers.
In this section, we examine how a large company—Amazon—used this 
entrepreneurial approach to generate significant growth by creating a new 
S-Curve—through its AWS cloud service.
Successful: Amazon Creates and Dominates  
the Cloud
Introduction
Amazon, the $107 billion (2015 revenue) company that grew 28% in the first 
quarter of 2016, was founded in 1994 by its current CEO Jeff Bezos.
Amazon started off selling books online to consumers. But its most profitable 
and fastest growing service is not for consumers—it’s AWS, a computer ser-
vice for large companies that Amazon started in 2006. AWS has maintained 
its lead in the cloud services industry despite efforts by some of the largest 
companies in the world—Microsoft, Google, and IBM—to dethrone it.
Case Scenario
What is AWS and why is it doing so well?
AWS rented computer access to companies. The market for such cloud infrastruc-
ture services totaled $23 billion in 2015—a market that grew 52% from the year 
before. AWS was the market leader in 2015 with a 31% market share and it grew 
at 63% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The second largest competitor, Microsoft, had 
9% of the market—but grew much faster, at a 124% annual rate.
AWS sustained its market leadership—in 2016 it had over a million business 
customers—due to five competitive advantages:
• 
More services. AWS could meet more business comput-
ing needs than could its competitors—these included “cloud 
native applications, e-business hosting, general business appli-
cations, enterprise applications, development environments 
and batch computing.”
• 
More different kinds of software. AWS had a large group 
of software providers that used AWS to deliver their software 
to companies as a service.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
93
• 
Large group of application development partners. 
AWS had many partnerships with application develop-
ment companies, managed service, and professional service 
providers.
• 
Most technical features. AWS offered the most features 
within its Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a 
Service (PaaS) offerings.
• 
Fastest rate of innovation. AWS introduced new service 
offerings and expanded its more advanced services at a faster 
rate than did rivals.
AWS’s sheer scale also provided Amazon with important cost advantages and a 
global scope that gave it access to a large population of potential customers. Its data 
centers made AWS services available in 33 zones within 12 regions worldwide. Each 
availability zone had up to 6 data centers and redundant power to keep customers 
from losing their service. Each data center operated between 50,000 and 80,000 
servers and could handle enormous volumes of data—102 terabytes per second 
worth of bandwidth.
While these advantages shed some light on AWS’s market leadership, a few inter-
views with AWS customers offered  a clearer picture of why AWS had so many customers.  
Here are four examples of businesses that used AWS because it met their spe-
cific needs:
• 
Large AWS capacity lets businesses add computing 
quickly as their needs change. Pfizer used AWS to oper-
ate a system that analyzed data for pharmaceutical research. 
As Dr. Michael Miller, Pfizer’s head of R&D High Performance 
Computing said “Research can be unpredictable, especially 
as the on-going science raises new questions.” AWS enables 
Pfizer to add to its computing capacity quickly when needed.
• 
Match computing supply with peak demand without 
building excess capacity. Online travel company Expedia 
received 240 requests per second from travel service providers. 
AWS enabled Expedia to meet demand surges without adding 
permanent extra computing capacity. As Murari Gopalan, tech-
nology director of Expedia, said, “The advantage of AWS is that 
we can use Auto Scaling to match load demand instead of having 
to maintain capacity for peak load in traditional data centers.”
• 
Ability to add storage quickly to keep up with 
demand, Music streaming service Spotify had 16 million 
licensed songs in March 2016 and was adding more than 
20,000 new ones daily. AWS’s S3 enabled Spotify to add to 
its storage just in time to keep up demand growth—rather 
than struggling with long lead times to add that extra capacity.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
94
How did AWS get started and grow?
Amazon created AWS to manage the high volumes of data needed to operate 
its e-commerce and others’ services. However, when AWS was first getting started, 
Bezos urged AWS developers to build the service in anticipation of making it avail-
able to outside businesses.
As former Amazon employee Steve Yegge recalled, Bezos “issued a mandate [in 
2002] that was so out there, so huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous, that it made all 
of his other mandates look like unsolicited peer bonuses.”
Bezos deliberately wanted AWS to be built to benefit customers. And after perfecting 
AWS to meet its own needs, Amazon wanted to profit from it.
But it was head of global infrastructure Chris Pinkham, who first came up with 
the idea of building a business around “Infrastructure of the World.” Working with 
website engineering manager Benjamin Black, Pinkham envisioned an infrastructure 
using a new technology for Amazon at the time—Internet Protocol —that would be 
so standardized that AWS customers could demand and get more computing capac-
ity just in the nick of time at a very low price.
By 2005 Amazon was offering AWS to some customers under nondisclosure agree-
ments—officially launching it in the summer of 2006. As Pinkham said, "Amazon is 
a very strong believer in moving very aggressively. [Amazon scaled AWS very quickly 
and set its prices slightly above costs to] lock the door for competitors.”
In 2015, Amazon finally let the world know just how successful AWS had become—it 
generated $6 billion in revenue and $1 billion in operating income—and by March 
2016, AWS had generated $2.6 billion in quarterly revenue growing at 64% with a 
23% operating margin—far above Amazon’s 2.1% average.
Case Analysis
AWS’s success— growing from scratch to nearly $10 billion in revenues in a 
decade— highlights the effectiveness of three principles that large companies 
should follow to achieve faster growth by introducing new products:
• 
Appoint CEO with a start-up mindset. Bezos is the 
only public company CEO who started his company and 
was still leading it very successfully nearly 23 years later 
as of January 2017. While this makes him exceptional, 
in theory other large companies could appoint CEOs 
who are focused intently on creating new products that 
deliver better benefits to customers— with a long-term 
focus that delays short-term profitability in exchange for 
gaining market share and achieving lower costs due to 
scale.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
95
• 
Create ever-better value for customers. AWS’s 
initial success was likely a result of its having been built 
for one of the most demanding computing environments 
in the world with the idea that it would be turned into 
a service that could be sold to businesses. Moreover, 
Amazon understood why companies would find AWS 
valuable— it had the potential to enable companies to 
rent increments of computing power when they needed 
it— thus lowering their fixed costs while enabling them 
to respond faster to changing customer demands.
• 
Persistently innovate without fear of failure. 
Amazon not only started off ahead, but it has continued 
to stay ahead in the highly competitive cloud services 
industry. AWS was likely guided by the insights about 
evolving corporate needs for cloud services because 
Bezos applied pressure on his people to keep its existing 
customers happy. Moreover, AWS’s leaders also under-
stood the requirements of a particularly demanding cus-
tomer—its own e-commerce operations.
Unsuccessful: ESPN’s New Programming Can’t  
Stop the Bleeding
Introduction
In contrast to Amazon’s success with AWS, ESPN was unable to create a 
new S-Curve because it defied this principle— creating a new program that 
it thought would offset the hemorrhaging of customers who failed to renew 
their cable subscriptions.
Between 2013 and 2015, ESPN lost $1 billion in revenue due to so-called 
cord-cutting—customers bypassing cable networks to access its service—
despite efforts to offset the loss by adding new programs—such as one cover-
ing college basketball.
Case Scenario
ESPN’s woes reveal a common strategic challenge that faces many large, success-
ful companies: upstarts offer customers a way to bypass their high prices and the 
incumbents respond by hoping the upstarts will fail and when that does not work, 
the incumbents try to invest in strategies that worked in the past.
Simply put, many large companies store their executives in a bubble that is isolated 
from the world of consumers and competitors who vie for their money and attention. 
In that bubble, lieutenants compete with each other to be most like the person with 

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
96
the power to promote them—rather than creating new products that will boost the 
company’s revenue growth rate.
ESPN’s problem was cord-cutting—that is, consumers who get access to TV pro-
grams without paying cable or satellite broadcasters for the privilege. Instead, they 
access the content through so-called Over the Top (OTT) or mobile services.
Cord-cutting is painful for companies like ESPN. In 2015, 1.13 million U.S. TV house-
holds cut the cord—that was four times the cord-cutting pace of 2014. Moreover, 
another 1.11 million were expected to cut the cord in 2016.
The good news for broadcasters was that TV revenue rose—3% to $105 billion in 
2015 and was expected to rise another 2% in 2016. The bad news was that OTT 
services were expected to grow much faster—up 29% to $5.1 billion in 2015 with 
another 30% growth forecast for 2016.
For consumers, the logic of cutting the cord was compelling. Rather than pay about 
$100 a month for a 200-channel cable bundle, consumers could watch smaller 
bundles containing the most popular sports and entertainment channels for $40 to 
$50 monthly from the likes of Amazon, YouTube, and Hulu. Moreover, so-called skinny 
bundles were available on the web for $25 a month.
Some of the cord-cutters were former ESPN subscribers—between 2013 and 
November 2015 they had cost the sports cable network about $1 billion since 2013.
The loss of revenue came from two sources—falling affiliate fees and declining 
advertising—both of which were due to a drop in the number of ESPN subscribers. 
Between 2013 and 2015, ESPN’s subscriber count fell about 7% from 99 million 
to 92 million.
That meant cable companies and satellite broadcasters paid $650 million less in 
affiliate fees—which hedge fund manager Eric Jackson considered pure profit—and 
lost $250 million in advertising as a result of the declining subscriber count.
ESPN responded late to the cord-cutting trend. Former ESPN commentator Bill 
Simmons said in a 2015 podcast that ESPN executives did not start talking about 
cord-cutting concerns until 2014.
And its reaction was to invest in more programming and an upgrade to its TV set 
rather than to offer its own cord-cutting service. In 2014, ESPN added a new net-
work called [Southeastern Conference] SEC Network, which focuses on college 
sports in the Southeastern United States, and it spent $125 million to revamp its 
Sports Center set.
ESPN’s efforts did nothing to stanch the outflow of subscribers. By May 2016, ESPN 
had lost even more subscribers— to about 89.5 million—representing a daily can-
cellation rate of 10,400. At $80 per subscriber, that meant ESPN was pulling in $7.1 
billion in revenue to cover its $6 billion in annual fees to sports leagues for the rights 
to broadcast their games.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
97
By July 2016, ESPN was contemplating offering its own streaming live TV package 
directly to consumers. The new package would be sold to people who did not cur-
rently subscribe to pay TV and would exclude professional basketball or football, but 
included “niche leagues” and possibly some college sports.
While clearly designed to avoid cannibalizing ESPN’s ever-declining base of cable 
subscribers, it was unlikely that subscribers to ESPN’s new live streaming package 
would generate sufficient revenue to stop the loss of cable subscription revenue.
ESPN’s three-year revenue decline highlights the way that big companies tie them-
selves in knots as they try to preserve their old way of making money in the face of 
rivals who are taking their customers with better value propositions enabled by new 
technology.
Case Analysis
More specifically, ESPN’s failure to offer new products that boosted its  
revenue growth highlight three failure principles:
• 
Executives in the bubble. ESPN executives acted as 
though they hoped that cord-cutting would go away as 
long as they did nothing about it. ESPN executives may have 
been more concerned about not rocking the boat than on 
responding to rivals offering skinny bundles at big discounts.
• 
Solving new problems with old strategies. ESPN’s 
2014 launch of SEC Network and its $125 million invest-
ment in modernizing its broadcasting studio might have 
worked to boost subscribers before cutting the cord was 
costing ESPN over a million subscribers a year. But those 
tactics failed to slow the loss of subscribers because they 
did not solve the fundamental problem—consumers 
were paying too much for a 200-channel bundle, most of 
which they did not want to buy.
• 
Focus on short-term revenues rather than creat-
ing superior value for customers. After two years of 
accelerating declines in the number of subscribers, ESPN 
finally began to talk about responding directly to these 
skinny bundles that were persuading consumers to cut the 
cord. However, ESPN’s proposed skinny bundle excluded 
the most popular programming—a move clearly designed 
to avoid cannibalizing regular subscribers—rather than to 
win back those who had cancelled their subscriptions.

■Principle Two  Large companies seeking growth from acquiring new products should make 
acquisitions that pass industry attractiveness, better off, NPV > 0, and integration tests.
Most acquisitions fail. The reasons for the failures are often one or a combina-
tion of four causes:
• 
Unattractive industry. The industry in which the 
acquired company competes is inherently unprofitable or 
less profitable than the industry in which the acquirer 
participates;
• 
Worse off. The combined companies are worse off 
when it comes to creating products that customers want 
to buy and/or at performing the critical activities needed 
to grow;
• 
Overpay. They pay so much for the acquisition that the 
price capitalizes all the future gains; and/or
• 
Inability to integrate. They fail to manage the integra-
tion of the acquired company effectively.
Therefore, companies seeking growth from acquisition of new products 
should evaluate whether the acquired company can pass four tests designed 
to screen out failed deals before they close. To that end, when considering 
potential acquisitions, companies should apply the four tests mentioned above.
Successful: Facebook Earns 35-Fold Return on Insta-
gram Acquisition in Under Three Years
Introduction
A month before its May 2012, initial public offering, Facebook paid $1 billion 
for a photo app—which connects photographers and people who love pho-
tos—with 50 million users and no revenues.
By December 2014, Citigroup valued that app at a whopping $35 billion—
accounting for 16% of its $221 billion market capitalization.
Facebook— which in 2011 had 845 million users and $3.1 billion in reve-
nues— acquired Instagram because it concluded that it would be better to 
buy a photo app than to build it.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
99
Case Scenario
In 2014, TechCrunch obtained documents describing a stand-alone Facebook mobile 
photo sharing app. However, Facebook decided that a better way to add a photo 
sharing service would be to acquire Instagram and allow it to operate as a stand-
alone app that would eventually connect to Facebook.
Perhaps one reason that Facebook bought Instagram—beyond taking out a poten-
tial competitor— was its tremendous popularity and its potential to grow. In April 
2012, Instagram had 27 million registered Apple iOS users and after getting a mil-
lion Android users within a week after its April 2012 launch, Instagram was expected 
to end up with 50 million registered users.
Instagram—founded in October 2010 by Stanford graduates Kevin Systrom and 
Mike Krieger and operated with 12 employees—would also have the potential to 
benefit from the acquisition by maintaining its company culture and getting access 
to Facebook’s much greater design and engineering resources.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued at the time that its users would be most 
comfortable with the service if it continued to operate mostly as it had before the 
acquisition—enabling users to share photos on social networks other than Facebook. 
“We think the fact that Instagram is connected to other services beyond Facebook is 
an important part of the experience. We plan on keeping features like the ability to 
post to other social networks, the ability to not share your Instagrams on Facebook 
if you want, and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your 
friends on Facebook,” said Zuckerberg.
Indeed the merger with Facebook contributed to Instagram’s growth. After all it 
began with 25,000 users, on its first day and by October 2015 it had 400 million 
monthly users. Systrom—interviewed at Instagram’s own building within the dis-
persed Facebook campus— attributed this growth to Facebook’s skills with sales, 
advertising, and targeting and relevance algorithms. That growth translated into 
considerable revenues. eMarketer estimated Instagram’s advertising revenues hit 
$600 million in 2015 and expected that figure to rise at a 116% annual rate to 
$2.81 billion in 2017. And Wall Street had little difficulty estimating how much that 
growth contributed to Instagram’s worth. At the end of 2014, Citigroup estimated 
that Instagram had 300 million users—contributed to its estimate that it would 
be valued at $35 billion—about 16% of Facebook’s roughly $221 billion market 
capitalization.
Instagram appears to be better off as a result of its merger with Facebook. As 
Systrom explained, “There are fun parts of running a startup and not-so-fun parts, 
and Facebook handles the not-so-fun parts, like infrastructure, spam, sales. The real 
questions are, how big can Instagram get? Is it 400 million, or bigger? Can it be a 
viable business if it is that big? These are at the top of the list for everyone in Silicon 
Valley.”

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
100
By July 2016, Instagram’s user count had soared to 500 million. Assuming Citigroup 
was to use the same valuation per user ratio, by July 2016, Instagram would have been 
worth a whopping $58.3 billion—a 58x return on Facebook’s April 2012 investment.
Case Analysis
The success of Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram highlights the power of 
passing the four tests as a means of achieving new product growth through 
acquisition:
• 
Attractive industry. Instagram participated in a two-
sided market, as Facebook did, in which the aim was to 
attract millions of users who did not pay so that com-
panies would pay to advertise to the users. The mobile 
advertising industry has proven to be large— growing at 
a 25.7% annual rate from $19.2 billion in 2014 to $60.2 
billion in 2019 and earning high net profit margins of 21%.
• 
Better off. The combined companies are clearly better 
off as evidenced by the rapid growth in Instagram users 
and revenues. This growth would not have occurred with-
out Facebook’s skills in sales, advertising, and relevance 
algorithms. Facebook clearly benefited to the extent that 
Instagram’s growth contributes to its revenues and stock 
market valuations.
• 
NPV > 0. Given the 58-fold return that Instagram has 
generated in about four years—using Citigroup’s assump-
tions—Facebook’s purchase price was enormously prof-
itable for Facebook.
• 
Ability to integrate. Zuckerberg kept his promise to 
Systrom—letting him run Instagram as a separate com-
pany with its own offices. Systrom’s feeling of confidence 
in the future and acknowledgments of the benefits of the 
merger are compelling evidence of the success of the 
integration process.
Unsuccessful: AOL/Time Warner Merger Destroys 
$228 Billion in Value over 15 Years
Introduction
On January 10, 2000, Internet service provider AOL announced plans to 
merge with magazine publisher and cable network, Time Warner, at a price of 
$182 billion—including stock and debt. The proposed deal would create AOL

101
Time Warner, a new company—55% owned by AOL and 45% owned by Time 
Warner—valued at $350 billion.
Fifteen and a half years later, the companies that entered history’s largest 
merger were worth about $122 billion—wiping out $228 billion in share-
holder value or 65% of the deal’s original value.
Case Scenario
What was AOL?
AOL—with a stock market value of roughly $163 billion before the deal was 
announced—provided access to the Internet to over 20 million consumers with PCs 
and dial-up modems through its AOL and Compuserve Internet services. In 1999, 
AOL generated $4.8 billion in sales, $748 million in net income, and employed 
12,100.
What was Time Warner?
Time Warner, with $83 billion in stock market value before the deal’s announce-
ment, owned media outlets—including Warner Bros. Studios, HBO, CNN, Warner 
Music, Time magazine—and a cable network with 320,000 high-speed broadband 
subscribers and 13 million cable subscribers. Time Warner’s 1999 sales were $14.6 
billion; it earned $168 million in profit, and had 67,500 employees.
Why did they merge?
The deal made then Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin the CEO of the new company 
while Steve Case, then-AOL CEO, became chairman.
The two companies merged because AOL CEO Steve Case was able to persuade 
Levin that such a merger would be great for his legacy.
To be sure, AOL thought it would boost its market share by gaining access to 13 
million Time Warner’s cable subscribers via Time Warner’s high-speed broadband 
network. While Time Warner’s pre-deal stock market value immediately doubled.
Case viewed the deal as creating a historically significant portfolio of brands. “I 
don’t think this is too much to say this really is a historic merger; a time when we’ve 
transformed the landscape of media and the Internet. AOL Time Warner will offer an 
incomparable portfolio of global brands that encompass the full spectrum of media 
and content,” he said.
Levin said that the deal was the best way for Time Warner to build a service that 
would enable it to provide Internet access for its subscribers to its content. As Levin 
said, "I saw the power of that combination and as I looked around at other compa-
nies and other opportunities, I concluded that either we would do something with 
AOL or we would build ourselves, but this is infinitely preferable.”

The deal destroyed $228 billion in shareholder value.
Two companies were spun out of the original as publicly traded companies and were 
acquired by others.
AOL was spun out of Time Warner in December 2009—at a value of $2.5 billion—
and Verizon acquired it for $4.4 billion in June 2015. Time Warner Cable became 
an independent company in Match 2009—valued at $9.25 billion—which Charter 
acquired in May 2016 for about $60 billion.
Two independent companies are still publicly traded: Time Warner—which operates 
a TV and pay cable network and produces films, was valued at $60 billion and Time, 
which owns magazines was valued at $1.7 billion—both on August 1, 2016.
But by October 2016, Time Warner's independence was imperiled when AT&T 
offered to acquire it for $85 billion—a deal that looked like it might not gain regula-
tory approval.
In hindsight, it is obvious that AOL suffered the most precipitous fall in value—
$159.6 billion in lost value or 97% of AOL’s pre-deal valuation—between the time 
the deal was announced and its ultimate acquisition by Verizon.
One reason for the drop in AOL’s value was the plunge in the value of dot-com stocks 
between the announcement of the merger and its completion.
The merger destroyed shareholder value for two overarching reasons. AOL’s value 
was vastly overinflated by the dot-com bubble that peaked two months after the 
merger was announced. In the year that elapsed between the merger’s announce-
ment and its closing, the NASDAQ had lost about a third of its value—falling from 
4,070 at the end of December 1999 to 2,781 in January 2001—and the market 
value of the deal had also lost a third of its value.
Secondly, the merger was poorly conceived and executed—starting with the absence 
of rigorous due diligence prior to closing the merger, which would have highlighted 
the many reasons not to do the deal in the first place.
At the core of the problem was Levin who acted alone—deliberately ignoring the 
advice of his subordinates who did not want to do the deal—because Levin was 
determined to leave Time Warner with a memorable legacy. According to Fools 
Rush In, Levin as he turned sixty wanted to be remembered for “integrity . . . high 
moral principles; and wisdom.”
As a result of his determination to leave behind a lofty legacy through the merger, 
Levin forced the deal to close without considering objectively its potential risks. This 
failure to brook opposition left all but a small number of Time Warner executives in 
the dark about the pending deal until hours before it was announced. Moreover, even 
fewer Time Warner executives supported the proposal.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
103
Levin allocated only three days to due diligence for the $165 billion merger and 
many top managers’ sale of large chunks of stock—including Case who sold shares 
worth $100 million—shortly after the deal closed.
Despite this, Time Warner could have gotten out of the deal in the year that elapsed 
after the January 2000 announcement of the deal. During this year, the dot-com 
crash deflated AOL’s stock price and the government investigated AOL’s flawed 
accounting.
Moreover, AOL and Time Warner cultures clashed during that year. AOL executives 
dominated their Time Warner counterparts, who felt they were being acquired by 
brash, young interlopers with inflated dollars. AOL’s culture was aggressive, and Time 
Warner executives—used to more genteel business practices—rebelled. In the midst 
of clashing cultures and conflicting management styles, AOL’s business slowed and 
then stalled.
Furthermore, AOL came under government scrutiny, and when AOL conducted its 
own internal investigation, it admitted that it had improperly booked at least $190 
million in revenue. If Levin had any second thoughts about the deal, this signifi-
cant accounting fraud would have given Time Warner the Material Adverse Change 
it needed to legally withdraw from the deal. But Levin bulldozed ahead—leaving 
behind a legacy, for sure, but not one of integrity, principle, or wisdom.
About 14 years after the deal closed, 97% of AOL pre-deal value had been wiped out.
Case Analysis
Why did the merger fail? Here are three reasons that would have become 
quite clear had the two companies’ CEOs not jammed the deal through so 
quickly:
• 
Overpaying. The dot-com collapse began a few months 
after the deal was announced. As noted above, the stock 
of the two companies declined so much during 2000 
that it could have represented a legitimate justification 
for calling off the deal or at least renegotiating its terms. 
Nevertheless, the deal went through and dot-com stocks 
continued to tumble. AOL was thus forced to write-down 
the value of its assets. In particular it incurred a total 
goodwill write-down for 2002 of $99 billion, reflecting 
the difference between the high price AOL paid for Time 
Warner and the 2002 market value of these assets. This 
reduced its net worth by two-thirds to $53 billion and 
nearly caused it to violate the terms of its debt contracts.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
104
• 
Decline in Internet advertising. Online advertising 
was thought to be a significant source of revenue from 
the combined firm. Time Warner thought that the AOL 
merger would lead to a huge boost in revenue. However, 
by the time the deal closed in 2001, the economy was 
slowing down and Internet advertising was decelerat-
ing. An example of this trend is Yahoo, which at the time 
derived most of its revenue from Internet advertising. In 
January 2001, Yahoo announced that its revenue growth 
would decelerate sharply from 88% to about 18% causing 
a 20% tumble in Yahoo shares. Yahoo attributed the poor 
revenue growth to the sharp slowdown in Internet adver-
tising and a continuation of 2001’s general economic slow-
down. The result was that an anticipated source of new 
revenue from the combined companies did not materialize.
• 
Cultural clash. While Levin and Case sold the deal, in part, 
on the expectation that cash flow resulting from integra-
tion of AOL and Time Warner would grow 30% in the year 
following the deal’s closure, the reality was less impressive. 
In fact, AOL Time Warner’s Earnings before Interest Taxes 
Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) rose 17% in that 
first year—far short of expectations. A big reason for this 
shortfall was a cultural clash that impeded efforts at inte-
gration—plans for which had been neglected during the 
merger negotiations. According to The Times, this cultural 
clash was a major factor leading Robert Pittman to quit in 
frustration in mid-2002. Until then Pittman had been the 
AOL executive in charge of trying to achieve synergies, such 
as increasing AOL members’ spending from $20 a month 
to $150 by selling magazines and other media to them and 
getting $200 a month out of cable users then spending $60, 
by selling them other AOL Time Warner products. Pittman 
failed in part due to cultural differences between AOL and 
Time Warner. There was a very ingrained culture at Time 
Warner and people there looked down at what they saw 
as a “gun-slinging culture” at AOL. They were suspicious 
of the dot-com world, intimidated by the high-tech nature 
of the medium and unconvinced by its value. And to Time 
Warner, Pittman epitomized everything that its old guard 
found intolerable about new media. He was seen as brash 
and overconfident. They called him “the Pitchman” for 
his excellent skills in marketing, but the salesmanship and 
unbridled enthusiasm that had been so valuable to a dot-
com start-up led Time Warner executives to bristle.

105
In retrospect it seems clear that had Levin been less determined to leave a 
legacy, he might have negotiated a mutually profitable deal that would have 
enabled AOL to use Time Warner’s high-speed cable network to replace its 
poky dial-up network. This would have given AOL a broadband channel over 
which to distribute Time Warner’s rich content, which would have attracted 
Internet advertising. And it would have given Time Warner a significant reve-
nue stream for its cable network. Ultimately Time Warner might have worked 
with AOL to digitize its content and share the resulting advertising revenues. 
Such an evolving partnership would have generated real value that might have 
withstood the dot-com stock collapse.
As Ted Turner, who founded CNN, which he sold to Time Warner, said on the 
tenth anniversary of the deal. “I’d like to forget it. That’s what goes through 
my mind. I almost didn’t do this interview because I didn’t want to dig it up 
again. Let it pass into history. The Time Warner-AOL merger should pass into 
history like the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It’s one of the 
biggest disasters that have occurred to our country.”
The failure of the AOL Time Warner merger illustrates why leaders should 
make sure that a proposed merger to boost revenues by acquiring new prod-
ucts passes the four tests of a successful acquisitions. To the extent that the 
AOL Time Warner merger failed each of the tests, it provides an excellent 
example of what CEOs should avoid in such mergers:
• 
Unattractive industries. The combined companies par-
ticipated in several different industries—many of which 
were unprofitable. Specifically, magazines and Internet 
service providers were inherently unprofitable industries 
that were getting less attractive. Meanwhile, cable net-
works and video content production were moderately 
attractive industries.
• 
Worse off. The combined companies were clearly 
worse off as a result of the merger. It became increas-
ingly clear that Time Warner’s broadband network could 
provide better Internet access than AOL. Moreover, Time 
Warner’s weekend of due diligence was insufficient to 
discover AOL’s accounting problems.
• 
Negative NPV. In destroying $228 billion in shareholder 
value, the AOL Time Warner deal appears to have had 
one of history’s most negative net present values. AOL 
overpaid tremendously—and the two companies should 
have used the 33% drop in the value of AOL’s stock dur-
ing the year that elapsed between the deal’s announce-
ment and its closing that the merger would destroy value.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
106
• 
Inability to integrate. The two companies were not 
well integrated and the goals of the merger were not 
achieved. This failure to integrate the companies was evi-
denced by Bob Pittman’s inability to encourage consum-
ers to spend more on the combined companies’ content 
and his ultimate resignation.
■
■Principle Three  Small companies seeking growth from designing new products should extend 
product features to gain a larger share of their customer’s wallets.
Many of the same principles apply to small companies as to large ones when 
it comes to designing new products to achieve revenue growth.
In general small companies have more limited resources than large ones so 
they take a different approach to designing new products. Small companies 
that achieve faster growth through new products follow five principles:
• 
Listen to customers. Small companies must listen to 
customers, observe how they use a company’s product, 
and learn how they are planning to spend their budgets. 
Such observations can yield insights into whether cus-
tomers might cut their spending on a company’s products 
or increase that spending and why. Companies might also 
identify opportunities for new products based on differ-
ent product categories where customers plan to increase 
their spending.
• 
Identify new services that will boost the company’s  
share of the customer’s spending. Companies should 
consider whether they have the skills required to build a 
compelling addition to such new product categories. To 
make this decision, companies should ask customers why 
they are increasing their budgets for those new prod-
uct categories, what factors they use to decide among 
competing suppliers of those new products, whether 
customers might be dissatisfied with those offerings, and 
whether the company could develop a new product that 
customers would find more compelling.
• 
Assess whether the company has the needed 
capabilities. If companies believe that they can design 
such a product, they should make sure that they have or 
can create the manufacturing, distribution, sales, market-
ing, and service skills need to turn the idea into a profit-
able line of business.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
107
• 
Build prototypes of the new services. Given their 
limited resources, small companies should not spend too 
much time and money developing an elaborate version of 
their product before introducing it to customers. Instead, 
they should build a quick, inexpensive version of the 
product’s most important features and give it to poten-
tial customers.
• 
Use customer feedback to improve the product. 
Companies should observe how those customers use 
the product; ask them for ideas on what is missing, what 
should be improved, and what should be removed. The 
company should use this feedback to build ever-improved 
versions of the product.
Successful: New Relic’s Six-Year Journey from Start-Up 
to Public Company with Five Products
Introduction
Lew Cirne started and ran Wily Technology, a web-performance monitoring 
company that he sold in 2006 for $375 million to CA Technologies. By 2008, 
he had started a new company—New Relic—that offers software to monitor 
the status and responsiveness of a company’s digital operations.
By December 2014, New Relic—which raised over $214 million in venture 
capital—sold stock to the public and by August 2016 it had a stock market 
capitalization of $1.7 billion with revenues coming from five different products; 
30% of its growth came from four new products introduced two years earlier.
Case Scenario
As Cirne explained in a December 2011 interview, in 2008, he started New Relic to 
undo all the mistakes he had made when he ran 260-employee Wily and sold it in 
2006 to CA Technologies for $375 million. Cirne spent 2007 playing with his one-
year-old daughter while thinking about what his next start-up would do. And one of 
the biggest things that bothered him about Wily was that only 15 of his 260 employ-
ees were writing the code that customers used. Most of the remaining employees 
participated in lengthy selling campaigns to convince Wily’s 500 to 600 customers to 
pay some $10,000 per central processing unit per month to run its software.
When Cirne started New Relic in 2008, he decided to run it with a far leaner sales 
and marketing staff. But to do that, he needed to rethink the customer’s experience. 
Instead of taking company executives on dinners and golf outings, New Relic built 
a product that sold itself. How so? It gave companies detailed information about, 

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
108
say, how many seconds it takes a consumer visiting their website to open their web 
page on a browser. New Relic’s software was extremely easy to use and—for most 
users—free. Needless to say, such a combination of an easy-to-use product at no 
cost was a far easier one to sell. This is not to say that no customers pay for New 
Relic’s product or that it has no sales force. But both of these are powerfully tamped 
down. By offering its software-as-a-service (SaaS) with a so-called freemium strategy, 
within three years of its launch, New Relic had signed up 14,000 customers—5,000 
of whom paid for a premium version (up to a $199 per month maximum) either 
directly or through a New Relic partner. The reason customers used New Relic was 
that it generated useful information and could be up and running quickly at no 
charge. As Spotify engineer Jade Rubick, said, “It is a sort of aha moment when you 
use it, like, oh my god, how did I ever live without this information. A lot of things you 
used to guess about are immediately obvious. . . . You can build this yourself or use 
a tool that takes a few minutes to install and does it all for you, and gives you more 
info than you would ever build.”
And New Relic did have a sales force but the sales people took calls from customers 
who had tried the product online and were seeking advice on whether they could 
satisfy their need for performance monitoring with the free version or whether they 
needed the premium one. Each of New Relic’s telephone sales people closed around 
40 to 50 deals a quarter. New Relic also focused on a particularly influential group 
of users—programmers who wrote in a language called Ruby on Rails—who had 
very high-quality standards and would advocate on behalf of vendors who satisfied 
them. “Rails developers are known for adopting the latest technologies, and pas-
sionately supporting products that rock, while brutally and vocally criticizing products 
don't meet their high standards. We were not the first product to target the Rails 
market, but we believe we had a strong product that immediately earned the sup-
port from thought leaders in the rails community,” said Cirne.
Satisfied customers tended to buy more from New Relic—a concept dubbed nega-
tive churn. Specifically, each New Relic customer spent 14% more than the previous 
year because over time, as companies used the service they needed more servers to 
operate it. So despite steadily adding about 750 customers per quarter, its revenues 
grew.
While the $15 billion IT management software market was barely growing, the SaaS 
segment was exploding. According to Cirne, that growth translated into 200% annual 
growth. But given the compelling value proposition for customers, this growth is not 
a big surprise.
Cirne’s goal was to reach at least 30,000 customers by the end of 2012. And for 
that, he would need to hire people to augment his staff of 70. Ironically, many of 
the people he would hire would be in sales and marketing — as well as R&D. But 
Cirne pointed out that his sales people were much more productive than those at 
Wily were.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
109
These investments had clearly paid off by the end of New Relic’s fiscal year 2016, 
which ended in March 2016. At that point, New Relic reported a 64% increase 
in annual revenues to $181.3 million. These revenues included 90% more large 
transactions—over $1 million—coming from 1,500 large-company customers such 
as Cisco Systems, Dunkin' Brands, LinkedIn, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Rakuten, and 
Unilever. New Relic also had many mid-market customers.
By that point, New Relic had introduced five paid products—each of which sold 
more than it had the year before. Moreover, 30% of New Relic’s growth came from 
products other than its original one—application performance management (APM). 
This represented a significant improvement from New Relic’s fiscal 2014 during 
which only 5% of its growth came from non-APM products.
The most successful of these new products was called Insights, which enabled com-
panies to understand what was causing performance problems for customers who 
were using their digital platforms. New Relic found that many large companies chose 
to purchase all of New Relic’s products due to the power of its Insights product.
New Relic cited an example of an Insight customer in the travel business. “They use 
Insight to look at ticketing activity second by second in real time, seeing how many 
tickets are flowing through the site, and in the same dashboard, they're showing 
how fast the page [moves] are and how fast the server time is. And they've proven 
beyond a shadow of a doubt that for their business, a slowdown in their application 
dramatically impacts their business in terms of ticket sales,” explained Cirne.
New Relic’s product development approach started with understanding the pres-
sures facing its end users—IT operations workers. New Relic built new products that 
would relieve customers’ pressures based on New Relic’s view of which new technolo-
gies would be most effective a few years into the future.
A key part of New Relic’s product development path was based on the idea of col-
lecting more types of data about its customer’s operations and analyzing that data 
to gain insights into what was slowing down their operations.
As Cirne said, “We’re going to be smarter about the data we collect and we’re going 
to collect more types of data. Imagine if all the data we are collecting from software 
is married with all the data by about what’s going on in the server, such as who 
logged into a server just prior to that server having a problem? What was the thing 
they changed on that server?”
New Relic envisioned that its new products would help IT operations people to 
manage very large computing environments. “We want to service the needs of the 
operations people who have these enormous environments. They’re busy, they’re 
overwhelmed, and they don’t have time to do anything but barely keep everything 
running. We want to make it easier for them to manage enormous environments by 
taking on the burden of doing more with the data that we collect for them,” he said.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
110
Ultimately, New Relic aspired to support companies that were rethinking how they 
work with customers based on what new technologies can do rather than automat-
ing their old business processes.
As he said, such companies use software as an offensive weapon. “The better you 
are at playing offense with software, at creating a great customer experience to drive 
the growth of your core business, the brighter your prospects are. If not, then you’re 
going to get Ubered. There’s going to be another company that will do your vertical 
what Uber is doing to taxis.”
New Relic was seen by one industry observer as an industry leader.
IT researcher Gartner put New Relic in its so-called magic quadrant in the APM 
market between 2011 and 2015 due to the strength of its vision and the effective-
ness of its execution.
In its December 2015 report, Gartner projected that “by 2020, 60% of APM  
buyers will reside outside of IT operations organizations, up from less than 35% 
today. New Relic identified this trend early on and designed its solutions to deliver 
software analytics data to bridge multiple functions across an organization.”
Case Analysis
New Relic’s success illustrates the way the four principles described above 
contribute to a small company’s growth through new products:
• 
Listen to customers. In general, New Relic developed 
new products with two ideas in mind. First, by listening 
to its customers New Relic was able to understand the 
pressures that made their jobs difficult. Secondly, it under-
stood where technology was headed and built products 
using such technologies to help customers manage these 
pressures.
• 
Identify new services that will boost the compa-
ny’s share of the customer’s spending. New Relic 
broadened its product portfolio to include offerings—
such as Insight—that enabled its customers to identify 
and solve problems with their digital operations. The 
value they saw in Insight encouraged companies to buy 
all of New Relic’s products, thus boosting its share of 
their budgets. Moreover, New Relic’s value encouraged 
customers to spend more on its products each year.
• 
Assess whether the company has the needed 
capabilities. New Relic’s new products relied substan-
tially on the capabilities it used to build and sell its initial 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
111
product. Specifically, New Relic’s strengths in engineering, 
product development, sales, and service were as useful 
for its new products as they were for its existing ones.
• 
Build prototypes of the new services. New Relic 
used a series of rough—but increasingly refined—ver-
sions of new products to test its new product ideas 
before selling them more broadly. This process enabled 
New Relic to get its products to market in a form that 
worked for its customers. As a result, between 2014 and 
2016, New Relic was able to boost the portion of its  
revenue growth from new products from 5% to 30%.
• 
Use customer feedback to improve the product. 
New Relic’s CEO listened to customers discuss their 
business challenges and their experiences with the com-
pany’s products. If he identified customers pain—either 
in unmet needs or flaws with its products—Cirne would 
invest to add products and/or improve those in New 
Relic’s current product portfolio to relieve that pain.
Unsuccessful: Imercive Is Shuttered after Initial and 
New Products Fail
The vast majority of start-ups fail. A common reason is that people who 
found companies lack a basic understanding of how to create a product that 
people will pay to use. So it comes as no surprise that when such founders 
realize that their first product idea is not working, they run out of money 
before their second product gains sufficient traction.
Introduction
Start-ups that fail due to a mismatch between their products and what cus-
tomers need follow specific failure principles:
• 
Company believes market will embrace its first product.
• 
Company builds first product before getting customer 
feedback.
• 
Company realizes customers will not use or pay for 
product after spending most of its capital.
• 
Company decides on a new product based on CEO’s 
vision.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
112
• 
Company runs out of capital before it can build second 
product and shuts down.
Imercive—“a social media marketing company that provided a first-of-its-kind 
instant messaging marketing solution to help brands create new channels for 
consumer engagement”—followed these five steps to start-up failure.
Case Scenario
Imercive was founded in September 2006 by Keith Nowak, a 2006 Boston University 
graduate with a BA in Philosophy. Imercive raised $500,000 in seed capital from 
angel investors, hired three software developers and two sales people, launched 
applications for Moviefone and Hershey’s, and shut down in December 2009.
In Nowak’s view, the problem with Imercive was its failure to stop building its first 
product fast enough and to work on its second one instead.
As he said, “We stuck with the wrong strategy for too long. I think this was partly 
because it was hard to admit the idea wasn’t as good as I originally thought or that 
we couldn’t make it work. If we had been honest with ourselves earlier on we may 
have been able to pivot sooner and have enough capital left to properly execute the 
new strategy. I believe the biggest mistake I made as CEO of Imercive was failing to 
pivot sooner.” Nowak described Imercive’s first concept as a way for advertisers to 
reach people via branded instant messaging. Nowak believed that consumers would 
add advertisers as “IM buddies” so that consumers could access information, receive 
updates, and make purchases of the advertiser’s product. Novak’s idea was that 
consumers would not want to see advertisements on their IM but would want use 
IM to chat with advertisers.
Before running out of capital, Nowak said that Imercive was “able to make some 
good progress” but could not “generate enough traction before running out of capi-
tal.” Nowak concluded that Imercive failed because it “got caught mid-pivot”—in 
other words it ran out of money before its second product became successful.
Imercive’s first product—which it piloted with 20 Boston area restaurants—was an 
IM service that let customers order food from restaurants. The pilot program failed—
taking longer and costing more than expected—after a year. In 2006, Nowak said 
he “began thinking bigger about my vision and the technology.” To that end, Imercive 
“pivoted,” offering a new product that would “provide IM apps to any brand looking 
to create further engagement with their consumers.” Imercive was unable to raise 
new capital and ran out of money before it could build the new product.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
113
Case Analysis
Nowak blamed Imercive’s failure on eight causes:
• 
It did not build quick prototypes of the product and get 
customer feedback.
• 
It spent too much money and time on its restaurant 
product before admitting it was a failure.
• 
It used a contract programmer to build the product who 
took too long to complete his work.
• 
It did not talk to restaurants about what they needed 
before building the product.
• 
It lacked sufficient capital to cover operating losses dur-
ing the long process of selling to large companies.
• 
It took too long to realize that the lack of competi-
tion did not mean that Imercive was targeting a large 
untapped market opportunity—it meant there was insuf-
ficient demand for its product.
• 
It waited too long before trying to build relationships 
with new investors to raise new capital.
• 
Its new strategy depended on obtaining revenues from 
marketing agencies that were cutting their budgets due 
to the financial crisis.
Imercive’s collapse highlights a critical source of start-up failure—a CEO who 
does not listen to customers before building a new product. Imercive might 
have survived had it spent a few hours on a presentation with images of the 
app screens, shown them to potential customers, and asked for feedback.
If Nowak had been willing to accept such rapid feedback, Imercive might have 
realized that its first idea was not going to result in significant revenues. He 
might also have used this approach to test his second idea, and perhaps others, 
before running out of capital or possibly finding some success.
■
■Principle Four  Small companies seeking growth from acquiring new products should only 
invest in products that uniquely relieve “customers’ pain points” when combined with the acquirer’s 
capabilities at a price that does not capitalize future gains.
It is amazing that anyone would buy anything from a start-up company.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
114
After all, most start-ups fail. I estimate that only one in five million unfunded 
start-ups end up being worth over a $1 billion.
Yet if a start-up is able to offer a product that satisfies customers’ unmet 
needs in such a way that customers are willing to pay more than the cost to 
produce the product, it may end up winning many customers.
But eventually, growth from a company’s original products decelerates. And 
that leaves the company with two options for adding new products to boost 
its growth rate: building the product or acquiring it.
Given their limited resources, it is surprising that start-ups can afford to 
acquire other start-ups. However, such acquisition opportunities do arise 
when another start-up has run out of cash—and can’t raise more capital—
before it has launched its product.
When such acquisitions do occur, the amount of cash paid to acquire the 
company is generally very small while most of the consideration is in the form 
of equity or possibly revenue or profit sharing.
Target companies in these dire straits are generally willing to consider such 
terms, particularly if the acquiring company has a growing customer base, 
ample capital, and a bright future.
In that case, they would be happy to receive some cash and perhaps stock in 
the acquiring company, particularly if that acquirer’s stock was highly valued 
and rising. But since small companies are usually privately held, the value of 
that stock may be difficult to assess.
Yet some small companies have acquired companies that added to their  
product portfolio. And of those few successful acquisitions, five success  
principles emerge:
• 
High customer willingness to pay. The combined 
companies will win a larger share of customers’ budgets 
and they are willing to pay a price for those product that 
exceed their cost to the company.
• 
Attractive market. The acquired product will provide 
access to a market that is small but likely to get big fast 
with significant profit potential.
• 
Better off together. The acquiring company has skills 
that when combined with the target will yield a significant 
share of that market.
• 
NPV > 0. The acquiring company does not overpay for 
the target.
• 
Excellent integration. Such integration consists of 
three components:

Disciplined Growth Strategies
115
• 
Cultural fit of key people. The acquiring 
company has a well-defined culture and invests time 
before discussing financial terms to assess whether 
the target’s key people will fit within that culture.
• 
Seamless-to-customer merging of products 
and capabilities. Having passed that test, the 
acquirer and target must agree on how they will 
combine their products and capabilities to gain 
market share.
• 
Link equity to accomplishment. Finally, in order 
to retain key people, the acquirer should give out 
equity over time linked to accomplishments such as 
a new product launch.
• 
Building acquisition capability. The acquirer must 
view each acquisition as a learning opportunity—looking 
at successful mergers as sources of best practices and 
failed ones as opportunities to learn how to avoid similar 
mistakes in future deals.
Successful: Microsoft Acquires Seattle Computing for 
$75,000
Introduction
One of the single best acquisitions in history took place in 1981. A then-small 
company, Microsoft, was in discussions with IBM—which was seeking an oper-
ating system (OS) for its personal computer.
How so? In 1980, when IBM decided to enter the PC business, it was in a 
hurry. So instead of building a closed system for which IBM would supply all 
the hardware, software, and peripherals, IBM forged an open one to encourage 
other companies to develop OS software, microprocessors, displays, printers, 
and other parts.
Case Scenario
In 1980, IBM approached Gary Killdall’s Pacific Grove California-based Digital 
Research, which had developed an OS called CP/M at the suggestion of Microsoft 
CEO Bill Gates. But when IBM came calling, Killdall chose not to come to the door—
instead asking his wife to handle IBM. She refused to sign the nondisclosure agree-
ment from Big Blue.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
116
So IBM came back to Bill Gates, asking him if he could provide the operating system 
IBM was seeking.
Microsoft did not have one, so Gates—with a net worth of $78.3 billion by August 
2016—decided to buy a company that did. On July 27, 1981, Microsoft paid 
$75,000 to acquire a 16-bit OS—QDOS (AKA 86-DOS)—from Seattle Computer 
Products. Soon after, the duo hired its programmer Tim Paterson and spent $50,000 
for all rights to 86-DOS, which became Windows. This was the foundation on which 
Gates’s fortune rested.
Had Gates merely acquired this technology and licensed it to IBM, he would not have 
achieved his phenomenal success.
What made the difference were the terms on which he structured the license.
Gates started with two basic insights. He understood that IBM–based on decades of 
dominance of business computing technology waves from desk calculators to main-
frames to data storage–believed that its entry into the PC market would confer on it 
instant legitimacy. Moreover, IBM believed that its heritage of marketing excellence 
would let it prevail over any PC rivals.
IBM met with Microsoft, which in 1980 had developed BASIC programming software 
for small hobbyist computers such as the Altair. Unfortunately, Gates had no OS 
available for IBM, but was quick to perceive the huge opportunity with IBM.
So he acquired QDOS—neglecting to mention the IBM licensing deal to Seattle 
Computer Products. Gates sold IBM the rights to the OS for use on IBM PCs for a 
pittance. He just asked for one thing: unfettered rights to license the OS to potential 
clones of the IBM PC. IBM, assuming that no PC-clone market would emerge quickly, 
was happy to grant Gates’s wish. IBM had convinced itself that Gates was naïve 
about the emergence of PC clones. If Gates was right, IBM reasoned, then IBM was 
no longer the marketing powerhouse it believed itself to be.
IBM was initially correct about its decision. Between 1981 when it introduced its first 
PC and 1983, IBM’s market share climbed to 42%. But by setting the standard in this 
rapidly growing market, IBM attracted competitors like Compaq—whose low-priced 
portable clones enabled it in 1982 to reach $100 million in sales during its first year, 
making it the fastest growing company in U.S. history. Dell entered the market in 
1984 and Hewlett Packard shifted from a proprietary architecture to IBM’s stan-
dard. By 1985, IBM’s share had fallen to 37% and four years later IBM controlled a 
mere 16.9% of the PC market. Finally in 2005 IBM sold its money-losing PC business 
to Lenovo Group Ltd.
Microsoft’s acquisition of Seattle Computing, coupled with Gates’s clever licensing 
deal with IBM led to the success of Windows. While the success on which Gates’s 
fortune is based came from many other decisions and products, it is difficult to imag-
ine that history will ever witness a better-spent $75,000 for an acquisition.

Case Analysis
More broadly, the success of this acquisition reveals the power of four of the 
principles outlined above.
• 
High customer willingness to pay. IBM was willing to 
pay a small amount for the OS—but Microsoft was able 
to extract higher prices from IBM clone makers.
• 
Attractive market. Gates realized that IBM would 
legitimize the PC market, thus expanding its size very 
quickly.
• 
Better off together. Seattle Computing clearly lacked 
Gates’s insights into how best to negotiate with IBM. This 
resulted in Microsoft’s successful licensing deal with IBM 
and assured that Microsoft received the lion’s share of 
the benefit.
• 
NPV > 0. Microsoft’s very low purchase price and the 
speed at which the deal closed—along with Gates’s good 
fortune that Digital Research refused to deal with IBM—
contributed to the high NPV of this acquisition.
Successful: Localytics Acquires Splitforce
Introduction
A second success case for small company acquisitions reveals deeper insights 
into how an effective acquirer integrates a small start-up.
In April 2015, I spoke with Raj Aggarwal, CEO of Boston-based app marketer, 
Localytics. Aggarwal was a Bain consultant before he started Localytics—
which raised $35 million in March 2015 and its clients included ESPN, eBay, 
Hulu, and Rue La La.
Case Scenario
In March 2015, Localytics acquired six-employee Splitforce—which was billed as 
“an automated A/B testing and predictive analytics tool for mobile.” Aggarwal did not 
disclose the terms of the deal. But he gave Splitforce's key people Localytics stock.
Here are five principles he follows to grow by acquiring new products.
1. Get to know the people well.
In most cases, the value of a start-up rests with its people. If the target does not even 
have revenues—but has a product with a fast-growing user base—then the key to 
making that acquisition pay off will be getting to know its key people.

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
118
Aggarwal explained how he got to know Splitforce's key people. "We worked together 
as partners since we had common customers. We were amazed that they shared 
our vision of using data for predictive purposes."
2. Make sure the acquirer and target share the same values.
The acquirer of a small start-up must be confident that those potential employees 
share the acquirer’s values.
Aggarwal believed that it was important to get to know people in a less formal set-
ting. "It is helpful if you can go out to dinner and have some drinks to get to know 
people better. We like to make fun of each other and if they were easily offended 
by our joking, we probably would have concluded that it would not have worked," 
he said.
The acquirer and target must also agree on what it takes to be successful in the 
market. Both companies shared a view of applying data science to solve business 
problems. Said Aggarwal, "We both agreed that data science is not just something in 
your head—it has to be useful to solve real world issues."
3. Know why the combined companies will be better off.
An acquirer and target must see how their products fit together on behalf of current 
and potential customers. And they must each have different strengths that when 
combined lead to greater market share.
Localytics was good at app marketing but it needed the ability to figure out which 
marketing techniques would work best for its customers. As Aggarwal explained, 
"20% of app customers never come back. By combining Splitforce's predictive intel-
ligence horsepower with Localytics' suite of mobile app marketing and analytics tools 
we will be better able to spot when someone's about to quit using the app or identify 
new ways to reach them”.
And Localytics also brought another skill—the ability to get and keep customers. 
"Splitforce's development people combined with our sales, marketing, and customer 
success organizations would help them to realize their vision for the future and boost 
the value of the combined company," said Aggarwal.
4. Set clear milestones for success and distribute equity based on their 
achievement.
As an acquirer and target are approaching agreement, it becomes crucial to define 
easily understood milestones for success on which to base equity distributions to the 
target’s key employees.
As Aggarwal said, “We did not want to overcomplicate it. We had a timeline for 
when the beta version of the product would be ready to go and when we could ship 
the combined product. If we don’t meet the goals, we will have to decide what to do 
next.”

Disciplined Growth Strategies
119
Equity for key people should be tied to achieving corporate goals. Aggarwal pointed 
out that in the deal with Splitforce, the vesting schedule for stock was tied to achiev-
ing the milestones.
5. Build up your acquisition capability.
Finally, many companies with strong marketing and sales skills find it faster some-
times to acquire companies with needed technical skills instead of doing all the 
development in-house.
So they need to improve their ability to make acquisitions that pay off. "We want to 
do lots of small acquisitions so we can strengthen our acquisition capability," con-
cluded Aggarwal.
Case Analysis
Absent a detailed small company acquisition failure case in this chapter, it is 
worth considering that the opposite of Aggarwal’s success principles could be 
thought of as primary sources of failure in small company acquisitions:
• 
Neglect to understand target’s key people. When 
start-ups acquire other start-ups, there is a big risk of 
infecting the combined company with one or two people 
who do not fit. In that case, the rest of the company will 
be distracted from working on key priorities. This could 
hamper productivity or cause worse outcomes;
• 
Fail to create a strong culture and to acquire 
companies with shared values. Many start-up CEOs 
believe that culture and people are less important than 
building the product. Failure to create a strong culture 
with clearly defined values can contribute to acquiring key 
people who do not fit, creating similarly bad outcomes;
• 
Ignore how the combined companies’ products 
and capabilities will yield market share gain. A 
merger should be made with the customer in mind. If an 
acquirer does not have a clear vision of how the com-
bined companies will be able to take a larger share of a 
customer’s budget because it offers the customer more 
value—in product variety and key capabilities—it is likely 
to be money poorly spent;
• 
Give out equity to key people when the deal 
closes. If an acquirer gives out equity to key target com-
pany employees up front, there is a risk that those people 
will lose their motivation and either stop working or 
leave; and

Chapter 4 | Growth via Building or Acquiring New Products
120
• 
Don’t learn from previous acquisition success and 
failure. Failure to learn from previous acquisition suc-
cesses and failures could boost the odds that future acqui-
sitions would either repeat previous mistakes or fail to 
capture the benefits of learning from previous successes.
Applying the Principles of Growth through 
New Products
Leaders seeking to assess whether they apply these principles to their organi-
zations should be able to answer Yes to these six questions:
• 
Do at least half of your company’s revenues come from 
products introduced in the last five years?
• 
Do you spend at least 20 percent of your time listening 
to customers and analyzing the strategies of fast-growing 
rivals to envision new products?
• 
When you consider new products, do you determine 
whether the market opportunity they will target is large 
enough to justify the investment?
• 
In building products, does your company use customer 
feedback on quickly developed prototypes to improve on 
new products before you launch them?
• 
If your company grows by acquiring companies that make 
new products, does it apply the four tests of a successful 
acquisition?
• 
Has your company improved the way it builds or acquires 
new products based on analyzing its prior successes and 
failures?
Chapter 8: Growth Road Maps provides a detailed methodology for applying 
the principles of growth through new products.
Summary
Speeding up growth by building or acquiring new products is a particularly 
challenging way to accelerate a company’s top line. Developing new products 
creates a tension within the organization with those who support the old 
ones. And acquiring a company can be quite risky unless the acquired com-
pany is managed properly. However, growth leaders overcome these challenges. 
Companies that create successful new products start with deep insights into 
unmet customer needs, and they deliver products that better satisfy those

121
needs than do rival products. And companies that grow through acquisition 
target superior capabilities at large and growing markets.
In the next chapter we take a deeper look at how companies achieve growth 
through capabilities—exploring how the most successful companies are able 
to match their capabilities with new growth opportunities and adapt those 
strengths to exceed the requirements needed to capture them.

Growth from 
Current or New 
Capabilities
In the last three chapters we explored growth opportunities that come from 
looking outside a company and trying to boost sales by matching what is 
inside the company with outside opportunities.
In Chapter 2, we looked at how to grow by selling more to current or new 
customers; in Chapter 3 we examined how to boost sales by expanding geo-
graphically; and in Chapter 4 we examined how companies can build or acquire 
new products that will add to a company’s revenue.
However, in Chapters 5 and 6, we look at how things inside a company can 
be aimed at new market opportunities to yield revenue growth—examining 
how a company’s capabilities can be applied to new market opportunities to 
gain share. And in Chapter 6 we will examine how a company’s culture can be 
used to accelerate its growth.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities

What Are Capabilities?
It is easier to start with what capabilities are not. I have found that many  
technology executives think that capabilities are the features of a specific 
product—such as a smartphone’s screen size or battery life. I would call these 
product features—which are most useful if those features produce benefits 
that boost customers’ willingness to buy. Capabilities are repeatable business 
processes—such as new product development, purchasing, human resource 
management, manufacturing, shipping, marketing and sales, and customer ser-
vice—which a company performs to win and keep customers.
Such capabilities vary by industry. But as we will see later in this chapter, the 
right capabilities are the ones that a company can coordinate to provide cus-
tomers with competitively superior value. More specifically, a company might 
sell customers a better product for which they are willing to pay a price pre-
mium by exercising superior capabilities—such as new product development, 
manufacturing, marketing, and customer service. Or companies might grow 
faster than the industry by selling a product of adequate quality at a much 
lower-than-industry-average price.
Small companies evolve their capabilities very quickly as they grow. Initially, 
the cofounders might split up tasks such as sales, hiring, finance, and product 
development. Once a company reaches, say, 50 to 75 employees, its capabilities 
might be the primary responsibilities of executives hired specifically to run 
them. Simply put, rather than the CEO doing the selling, hiring, and product 
development—those capabilities would be the full-time job of specific vice 
presidents for each of those functions.
As long as a company’s evolving capabilities deliver competitively superior 
value to customers, the company is likely to keep growing. However, if the 
CEO does not monitor the changing external environment, such a winning 
collection of capabilities might evolve into a competitive strait jacket that 
impedes a company’s ability to adapt to changing customer needs, upstart 
competitors, or new technologies. Simply put, success can give undue corpo-
rate power to the people in charge of a company’s key capabilities. And those 
executives may put their own parochial interests ahead of what makes sense 
for the company and its customers. Such an internal focus is likely to create 
an opening for rivals who are more focused on how to boost market share by 
offering customers a better value proposition than these now-self-defeating 
incumbents. On the other hand some companies have built up capabilities 
that—with minor modifications—can enable them to generate meaningful 
new growth in a sequence of large markets.

125
Principles of Growth from Capabilities
To achieve growth—whether for large or small companies using current or 
new capabilities—companies ought to give customers a product that delivers 
more value to customers than competitors by using their capabilities to satisfy 
the unmet needs of customers in the market from which they hope to take 
share. Leaders ought to start by listening closely to the people to whom they 
want to sell their product to identify and rank potential customers’ unsatisfied 
needs; inventory their current capabilities and evaluate which ones they can 
use to design, deliver, and service new products that potential customers will 
be eager to buy; and decide whether to hire, partner, or acquire to close key 
capability gaps.
Large companies seeking growth from current capabilities apply this principle 
from the inside out; whereas large companies seeking growth from new ones 
do so from the outside in. More specifically, big companies look for new mar-
kets where their strongest capabilities will enable them to win—as Apple did 
when it went from its iPod success to introducing the iPhone. We contrast 
this success case by the exploration of how GM’s 2009 bankruptcy might have 
been fended off if the capabilities of its Saturn subsidiary had spread through-
out the company—rather than being homogenized just a few years after it 
took the lead from Toyota and Nissan in the small car segment a few years 
after it launched. As we will explore in the case of News Corp.’s purchase of 
Myspace, a large company can also destroy the value of a promising start-up 
it acquires unless the large company’s capabilities help that start-up to grow.
The danger with the inside-out approach is that the company does not per-
ceive changes in its competitive environment and thus preserves capabilities 
of increasingly limited competitive value. Companies that follow the outside-
in approach enjoy the advantage of listening to customers with a more open 
mind since they are willing to change their capabilities to satisfy the unmet 
needs they discover. The risk of the outside-in approach, however, is that the 
cost of creating new capabilities is so high that the return—in the form of 
profitable growth—must be much higher to justify the investment. Ultimately, 
the two meet in the middle—the inside-out companies modify their current 
capabilities and the outside-in ones reuse many of their current ones—so that 
the resulting bundle of capabilities generates rapid growth.
For small companies, the same principles apply. However, in most cases small 
companies face a more binary set of outcomes. Rather than muddling along if 
their capabilities are not the best in their industry, small companies are more 
likely to perish if they can’t assemble the capabilities needed to satisfy unmet 
customer needs. In this chapter, we review the case of SailPoint, an informa-
tion security company that enjoys rapid growth by crafting its capabilities—
such as product development; human resource management, and customer 
service—to deliver a service that customers perceive as far superior to that 

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
126
of rivals such as IBM. And in exploring a failure case—HealthSpot, a maker 
of kiosks for virtual meetings between doctors and patients—we see how a 
small company can easily run out of capital because its capabilities are so weak 
that an insufficient number of customers are willing to pay for its product.
Let’s examine growth from current capabilities by examining pairs of case 
studies of successful and unsuccessful applications of four principles:
• 
Large companies seeking growth from current 
capabilities should identify and attack large untapped 
markets where their unique capabilities will enable them 
to gain significant market share.
• 
Large companies seeking growth from new capa-
bilities should build or acquire the capabilities needed to 
gain a significant share of new markets created by chang-
ing technology and evolving customer needs.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from current 
capabilities should identify and attack untapped mar-
kets where their unique capabilities will enable them to 
gain significant market share.
• 
Small companies seeking growth from new capa-
bilities should envision new market opportunities and 
build, partner, or acquire the skills need to gain share.
■
■Principle One  Large companies seeking growth from current capabilities should identify and 
attack large untapped markets where their unique capabilities will enable them to gain significant 
market share.
If a large company can assemble the right capabilities and use them to attack 
large markets, they can grow substantially. However, CEOs must gather data 
from customers and about competitors to gain sufficient assurance that their 
companies’ capabilities will yield market share gains.
Success in applying current capabilities to new markets hinges on four 
principles:
• 
Identify unmet customer needs. A CEO must listen  
to customers with an ear toward whether they are  
satisfied with current products or whether they might be 
unhappy with current offerings. If unhappy, the CEO must 
identify specific unmet needs and try to assess whether 
the company can satisfy those needs profitably.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
127
• 
Analyze capabilities needed to satisfy those unmet 
needs. To answer that question, the first step is to figure 
out what capabilities a company would need in order to 
satisfy those unmet customer needs. For example, if a 
customer was looking for a device that would enable her 
to access mail wirelessly and watch videos, a company 
might need to develop partnerships with wireless service 
providers and video producers—in addition to manag-
ing hardware designers, manufacturing, procurement, and 
shipping capabilities.
• 
Assess the company’s ability to outperform rivals 
in these key capabilities. If a company can’t perform 
the key capabilities better than rivals then it may not be 
able to take customers from them. And if it can’t win cus-
tomers, it will fall short of its growth goals. Therefore, a 
CEO should hire an objective outsider to assess how well 
the company performs those key capabilities relative to 
competitors—based on customer and industry research.
• 
If the company has the right capabilities—or can 
assemble them—it should develop a strategy for 
the new market. Based on the foregoing analysis, a 
CEO ought to conclude whether the company has or can 
assemble—through partnerships, key hires, or acquisi-
tion—the capabilities needed to succeed in satisfying cus-
tomers’ unmet needs. If the evidence suggests the answer 
is yes, the CEO should develop a strategy—including 
choices of target customers, product features, pricing, key 
capabilities, and investment—to apply its capabilities to 
the new opportunity.
Case Studies
Successful: Apple Captures $150 Billion in 
Smartphone Profit
Introduction
In 2007, Apple tapped its then-current capabilities of hardware design, eco-
system building, supply chain, and marketing to introduce a new kind of cell 
phone—the iPhone. The result was a product that had sold a billion copies 
between 2007 and August 2016, generated $155 billion in operating profit for 
Apple in 2015 alone—which represented 92% of the industry’s 2015 profits—
and accounted for 66% of Apple’s 2015 revenue.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
128
Indeed the iPhone has accounted for an extraordinary amount of profit during 
its life. According to Strategy Analytics, a research firm, “from 2007 through 
Q2 2016, the iPhone generated operating profit of [nearly] $214 billion with 
an operating profit margin of 34.5%.”
Case Scenario
How did Apple achieve these exceptional results? In a nutshell, it is better than its 
1,000 smartphone rivals in critical capabilities. More specifically, Apple outcompetes 
its rivals in four critical areas:
• 
Product design. Apple decided to sell the iPhone to people 
who were using cell phones—already a huge market. But the 
superior design of its hardware—and its much broader set of 
product features—encouraged many people to swap their cell 
phones for iPhones.
• 
Marketing. Apple’s advertising campaigns, its carefully 
crafted launch presentations by former CEO Steve Jobs, and 
its network of Apple Stores—stocked with so-called genius 
bars that gave consumers technical help all contributed to 
a significant consumer fever to own iPhones. Indeed Apple’s 
marketing contributed to its ability to charge a higher price 
than do its rivals—in 2014, Apple’s iPhone sold for a global 
average of $624, compared with $185 for smartphones run-
ning Android.
• 
Third-party partnerships. Apple needed to make sure that 
the iPhone could make consumers’ lives better. To that end, it 
created opportunities for independent application developers 
to sell their wares to consumers on its App Store—in its first 
18 months, consumers download four billion Apps that were 
either free or priced at 99 cents apiece of which Apple kept 
30%. In addition, the iPhone relied on Apple’s previous success 
creating iTunes—the first legal online music store for which 
consumers paid 99 cents per song. And Apple partnered with 
wireless service providers to provide iPhone customers with 
voice and data services.
• 
Supply chain. While the first three capabilities were essen-
tial to create demand for the iPhone, Apple would not have 
generated so much profit were it not able to supply millions of 
iPhones to satisfy that demand. Moreover, Apple shareholders 
would only benefit from its ability to match demand and sup-
ply if customers were willing to pay a much higher price for 
an iPhone than its cost to Apple. Due to Apple’s contracts with 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
129
suppliers such as Foxconn, Apple was able to manufacture 
iPhones and deliver them to Apple stores at a unit cost that 
was well below its price.
In developing the iPhone, Apple was targeting capabilities that it had developed 
at different levels during its history. For example, its ability to design and market 
consumer-pleasing hardware had been around for decades.
Among these skills was the ability to entice potential customers for a new product 
through compelling demonstration delivered by Apple’s late CEO, Steve Jobs.
His iPhone demo was extremely effective. Jobs kicked off its January 9, 2007, iPhone 
demonstration by saying, “This is a day I have been looking forward to for two and a 
half years.” From there he told stories about why consumers disliked their cell phones 
and then showed listeners why the iPhone would replace their cell phone hate with 
iPhone love. To that end, Jobs showed them how the iPhone could play music and 
watch a movie clip, how it could make a phone call, operate an address book and 
voicemail, send a text or email, look at photos, browse news sites, and use Google 
Maps to find a nearby Starbucks.
But when it came to designing the iPhone hardware, building a supply chain and 
partnering with third parties, Apple had to extend its capabilities to meet the require-
ments of making the iPhone a success.
For example, Apple had never needed to build a device that contained a small 
antenna to connect it to a wireless network nor had it ever created a touch screen 
that could implement gestures like the one required to expand the size of a photo 
or select letter from an onscreen keyboard.
Apple—which spent about $150 million building the iPhone—was on a mix of solid 
and shaky engineering ground in the years leading up to its launch. Apple's hardware 
engineers had spent about a year working on touchscreen technology for a tablet 
PC and thought they could build a similar interface for a phone. Moreover, a new 
semiconductor, the ARM11 chip, made cell phones sufficiently fast and efficient to 
power the combined functionality of a phone, a computer, and an iPod.
However, Apple’s engineers had some huge technical challenges to overcome. They 
had no prior experience in antenna design (a small but powerful one was needed), 
radio-frequency radiation (the iPhone needed to be safe when close to customers’ 
brains), network simulations (the pathway for voice and data needed to be solid), and 
in building a glass screen that would not scratch and be touch sensitive.
After intense struggles within Apple, the company managed to build hardware 
that excited consumers. Engineers expected to be building a small version of the 
Macintosh but ended up building three different early versions of the iPhone in 
2005 and 2006. Ultimately Apple made six “fully working prototypes of the device 
it ultimately sold—each with its own set of hardware, software and design tweaks,” 
according to the New York Times.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
130
Apple’s partnership with AT&T was a tour-de-force by Jobs who tipped the bargain-
ing power in favor of handset suppliers and away from wireless service providers.
Following 18 months of secret meetings, Jobs negotiated a five-year deal with AT&T’s 
wireless division that would give it exclusive rights to service the iPhone in exchange 
for about 10% of iPhone sales in AT&T stores and a small share of Apple iTunes 
revenue. The deal granted Apple about $10 a month from every iPhone customer’s 
bill; granted Apple design, manufacturing, and marketing control over the iPhone; and 
obliged AT&T to invest millions in a new service—visual voicemail along with stream-
lining its in-store sign-up process.
Within six months of its June 2007 launch, Apple’s deal with AT&T had clearly made 
both parties better off. While AT&T attracted many new customers—40% of iPhone 
buyers had never used AT&T before, Apple sold an estimated three million iPhones 
at $399—generating $80 in profit per unit and another $240 from its share of 
customers’ two-year iPhone contracts with AT&T.
And the supply chain that Apple built to satisfy iPhone demand helped to lock in 
those enormous profits. For example, by April 2016, Apple enjoyed a 60% gross 
margin on its iPhone SE. Customers paid $399 for the device that cost Apple $160 
to manufacture. Apple was able to satisfy demand for the iPhone so profitably in 
part because of its global supply chain, which sourced parts from different countries, 
manufactured and assembled them in others, and operated warehouses to meet 
local demand for reliable and quick order fulfillment. Its 200 suppliers included 
displays made in Japan by Japan Display and Sharp, Touch ID sensors made in 
Taiwan by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Xintec, transmit-
ter and amplification modules from Skyworks and Qorvo in the United States, and 
screen glass from Corning and GT Advanced Technologies.
Five years after taking over as CEO, Tim Cook had not demonstrated the ability to 
apply Apple’s capabilities to a new product category as it did for the MP3 player with 
the iPod or the tablet with the iPad.
As a result, despite introducing a highly touted new product—the Apple Watch—
the company suffered two quarters of consecutive revenue and profit decline. By 
December 2016, it remained to be seen whether Apple would be able to continue 
to do what led to the iPhone’s tremendous growth—apply current capabilities to a 
large existing market by building a superior product.
Case Analysis
The iPhone case highlights five key success factors in applying this principle:
• 
Target the right market. One of the most obvious 
realities for a large company is that meaningful growth 
can only come from targeting new markets that are big 
enough to make a difference in the company’s revenue 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
131
growth rate. For example, assuming that a new entrant 
may eventually be able to gain 10% of a market, a com-
pany with $100 billion in revenue would need to target 
a market of at least $200 billion in total sales in order to 
achieve 20% revenue growth from that market. There are 
very few markets that large—and the number of those 
markets that are relevant to a large company is limited by 
the company’s capabilities. The cellphone market turned 
out to be big enough to make a difference to Apple’s 
growth rate for years.
• 
Identify significant customer pain. If a large com-
pany can find a large enough market, there can only be 
an opportunity to win a meaningful share of that market 
if customers are not satisfied with the product offerings 
of incumbent competitors. As we saw in this case, Apple 
clearly understood that there were many ways in which 
cell phone customers were dissatisfied with the available 
products. In the absence of such customer pain, it may be 
difficult for a new entrant to use its skills to gain sufficient 
market share to warrant the investment.
• 
Assess whether the company’s current capabilities 
can yield rapid market share gain. Every industry 
has customers with unique needs and the companies that 
satisfy the customer demand do so through the exercise 
of unique capabilities. For example, if customers demand 
the lowest prices and the fastest delivery for a product, 
companies seeking to gain market share will need strong 
capabilities in purchasing raw materials at very low prices, 
manufacturing products at the lowest cost in the indus-
try, and operating warehouse and delivery networks that 
fulfill customer orders more efficiently than rivals. When 
Apple targeted the cell phone market, it realized that cus-
tomers wanted to replace their cell phones and iPods 
with a single device that would make their lives more 
efficient. Apple also realized that the capabilities it had 
developed to succeed in the MP3 player market with the 
iPod would help Apple succeed with the iPhone.
• 
If so, adapt current capabilities to requirements of 
the new market. In order to be a source of growth, a 
CEO must adapt a company’s capabilities so they can yield 
enough value in the eyes of customers to persuade them 
to buy the company’s new products. To that end, the CEO 
will need to rethink all of the company’s capabilities—and 
adapt each of them to the requirements for winning in the 

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
132
new market. Apple was able to use many of its capabili-
ties—such as advertising, retailing, and product supply—
with little alteration between the iPod and the iPhone. 
Yet when it came to hardware design and partnerships, 
Apple needed to enhance its capabilities. To that end, Apple 
enhanced its antenna and touch screen engineering skills 
and built new partnerships with wireless service providers. 
Unless a company adapts its capabilities to the competi-
tive requirements of new markets, the capabilities will no 
longer contribute to growth—and may even impede the 
company’s ability to capture new markets.
• 
Look for new opportunities to achieve growth 
from the firm’s capabilities. Thanks to the ever- 
evolving nature of markets, companies must pay attention 
to new technologies, upstart competitors, and changing 
customer needs. The best CEOs work simultaneously 
at adapting the firm’s capabilities to the company’s core 
markets, the next new growth opportunity, and the ones 
thereafter. In the years between his 1997 return to Apple 
until his tragic death, Steve Jobs was able to continue to 
invest in growth opportunities and think about where 
Apple would look for more growth once those oppor-
tunities had matured. In the absence of such leadership, 
a firm’s capabilities can atrophy and become an end in 
themselves. Such atrophy can ultimately lead a formerly 
successful company to slow down and ultimately give up 
its leadership position.
Unsuccessful: After 101 Years, GM Files for 
Bankruptcy
Introduction
In 2009, General Motors—which at its peak in the 1950s controlled over half 
of the automobile market—filed for bankruptcy. While the reasons for its 
bankruptcy filing were many—one factor that seems particularly significant 
was its failure to adapt to competition from Toyota and Nissan in the market 
for small, fuel efficient vehicles.
What is most noteworthy about this failure is that a former GM CEO had 
forged a path to success in this rivalry. In the 1980s, then-CEO Roger Smith 
tried to refresh the way GM designed, manufactured, and sold cars so it could 
compete with these overseas rivals. His efforts worked very well—creating 
a new line of cars that outperformed in customer satisfaction and quality a 
mere four years after launch.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
133
Sadly for GM, Smith's successor killed the effort to rejuvenate GM based on 
the success it achieved with Saturn.
This failure to adapt its capabilities to tap new markets left GM vulnerable—
making it harder to avoid bankruptcy.
Case Scenario
Why GM failed
General Motors was founded in September 1908. On June 1, 2009, at 8 a.m.—
almost 101 years later—it ceased to exist, and control was handed over to turn-
around executive Al Koch. Thanks to $19.4 billion in loans and $30.1 billion more in 
debtor-in-possession financing, a huge amount of effort by the U.S. government and 
GM's management, unions, dealers, suppliers and bondholders, the effects of that 
failure was terrible, but not catastrophic.
The United States took on 60% of the new GM, which included Chevy, Buick, GMC, 
and Cadillac. Canada took 12% after lending GM $9.5 billion, the United Auto 
Workers (UAW) received 17.5% (as payment for $9.4 billion of its $20 billion in 
health care obligations) with warrants to buy 2.5% more, the bondholders received 
10% to as high as 25% through warrants, and old GM common shareholders received 
approximately nothing. Twelve to 20 more GM factories were slated to close, 21,000 
union workers would be fired, and 2,400 GM dealers would shut down.
Three factors contributed to GM’s bankruptcy:
• 
Bad financial policies. GM had posted a negative net 
worth for nearly three years before it went bankrupt. Moreover, 
thanks to two CEOs—Rick Wagoner and Fritz Henderson—
who had risen up from its finance department, GM turned 
vehicles into a loss leader for car loans The 2008 financial cri-
sis exposed the truth that GM had made too many bad loans.
• 
Failure to adapt to competition. GM had been ignor-
ing competition—with a brief interruption (Saturn in the 
1980s)—for about 50 years. At its peak, in 1954, GM con-
trolled 54% of the North American vehicle market. By 2008, 
that figure had tumbled to 19%. Toyota and its peers took 
over that market share. Compared to its toughest competi-
tors—GM's cars were poorly designed and built; took too long 
to manufacture at costs that were too high; and as a result, 
fewer people bought them, leaving GM with excess production 
capacity.
• 
Managing in the bubble. GM managers got promoted 
by toeing the CEO's line and ignoring external changes. What 
looked stupid from the perspective of customer and competitors 

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
134
was smart for those bucking for promotions. At the core of this 
managing in the bubble was confirmation bias—the tendency 
of managers to filter out information that does not match up 
with their preconceived notions. Confirmation bias kept GM from 
viewing the threat from Toyota as significant, contributed to its 
decision to pull its electric car off the market, and led it to ignore 
the impact of higher gas prices and a collapse in credit markets 
on consumers' willingness to buy profitable gas guzzlers like the 
Hummer or tricked-out Escalades and SUVs.
The reason it was so difficult for GM managers to break out of this bubble was that 
it was created in response to a competitive threat from Ford in the 1920s. And that 
response proved effective for another four decades.
After all, Ford dominated the market then. In the early 1920s, its Model T— offered 
only in black— controlled 60% of the U.S. automobile market and half of the indus-
try worldwide.
Between 1908 and 1920, GM’s founder Bill Durant acquired 39 companies includ-
ing Cadillac, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, and several parts-makers— but ran 
them as separate units. In 1923, GM nearly went bankrupt and it took on a new 
CEO—Alfred Sloan, a ball-bearing entrepreneur who imposed tight financial controls. 
Under Sloan GM expanded internationally—establishing factories in 15 countries 
and buying Vauxhall in Britain and Opel in Germany.
Most important, Sloan and other executives developed a strategy to wrest control of 
the industry from Ford based on the idea that as workers ascended the corporate 
ladder, they could purchase ever more prestigious vehicles to celebrate their prog-
ress. GM would build cars that American consumers wanted—offering them different 
makes and models at different prices. Moreover, GM created an organizational struc-
ture and culture to support the strategy—yielding substantial market share gains. 
By the mid-1930s, GM controlled 42% of the market while Ford's share fell to 21%.
By the early 1960s, with its market share at over 50%, its bosses were more wor-
ried about avoiding antitrust action and a possible breakup than cost reduction 
or improving GM's slow decision-making process. In the 1970s, GM responded to 
government standards requiring automakers to boost fuel efficiency by making 
dull-looking, unreliable vehicles that were less compelling to American consumers—
customers reported that American vehicles had 20% to 40% more defects than 
equivalent Japanese models.
Saturn
GM went back to the principles that Sloan had put in place in the 1920s to take 
back market share from Japanese rivals. In January 1985, GM’s CEO Roger Smith 
announced plans to create Saturn—a new division located in Spring Hill, Tennessee, 
specifically to take market back market share from Toyota and Nissan in the lower-
priced, fuel efficient segment of the automobile market that accounted for about 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
135
25% of the market. By 1993, Saturn—financed with $3.5 billion from GM—had 
grown rapidly and led its Japanese rivals in dealer and customer satisfaction, quality, 
and reliability according to customer surveys.
Saturn achieved this success by conducting critical capabilities—product develop-
ment, marketing, selling, service, and human resources—more effectively than the 
rest of GM. And in so doing, GM sought to create loyal customers boost long-term 
dealer profitability, ease the customer buying process, produce better quality cars, 
and boost employee engagement.
More specifically, Saturn’s success offered GM compelling examples of ways that it 
could increase its market share by performing eight critical capabilities in new ways:
• 
Product development. Rather than engineers working 
in isolation from buyers, Saturn designed new products by 
working with customers and cross-functional teams—includ-
ing engineering, purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, sales, 
and finance—and driving competitors’ vehicles to design and 
build competitively superior products that were more fuel 
efficient—due to a lighter engine and frame—and easier to 
repair—as a result of using plastic as a bumper material.
• 
Advertising. Saturn produce memorable TV ads such as one 
featuring a customer in Alaska that needed service—rather 
than ask the customer to go to the dealer, the ad featured a 
helicopter flying technicians to her house.
• 
Selling. Saturn hired college-educated sales people who were 
not paid on commission. The salespeople asked customers 
about their transportation needs, provided information about 
no-haggle pricing set at 90% of rivals’, and were motivated 
to build high levels of customer satisfaction—50% of Saturn 
customers referred others to the company.
• 
Retailing. Unlike other care companies, Saturn offered fran-
chisees larger territories—340 retail sites with 2 sites per 
franchisee—contracting with managers who took a long-term 
view and had a track record of creating long-term customer 
satisfaction and a willingness to invest in Saturn’s long-term 
success. Boost dealer territory size, and introduce no-haggle 
pricing to boost consumer satisfaction with the buying process.
• 
Engaging workers in operational decisions. Saturn’s 
approach to human resources was to reduce the number of 
formal job classifications from about 200 to 2; provide work-
ers with salaries, rather than hourly wages; tie 10% of pay 
to achieving profit targets—which was aided by access to 
detailed information about vehicle costs; decentralized teams; 
and extensive training.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
136
By 1993, two-thirds of Saturn owners said that they would purchase a new vehicle; 
the company generated $3 billion in revenue and had earned a profit of $100 million. 
One of the goals of Saturn had been to transfer best practices—more specifically its 
more effective approach to product development, advertising, selling, retailing, and 
human resources—to the rest of GM.
However, Smith left the CEO’s slot in 1990 and by 1991, his successor Jack Smith, 
was not committed to that goal. Indeed Smith insisted on stripping away Saturn’s 
uniqueness, insisting on managing all its divisions centrally with a tight fist and 
demanding that Saturn management and its union align with GM’s traditional ways 
of doing things.
If he had been, perhaps GM would have been revived as it was under Sloan—rather 
than being forced into a 2009 government bailout.
Case Analysis
GM’s bankruptcy highlights three key failure principles that CEOs seeking 
growth from existing capabilities should avoid:
• 
Appoint a CEO committed to preserving old 
ways of operating. While Roger Smith used his ten-
ure to innovate in many ways—including creating Saturn 
from a “clean sheet of paper,” its success created jealousy 
throughout GM. Rather than trying to learn from Saturn’s 
success, the other divisions sought to stamp it out and 
when Jack Smith became CEO, they had their champion 
who pushed Saturn to toe the traditional GM line.
• 
Ignore the consumer. Whereas Saturn enjoyed its ini-
tial success by listening to customers, learning from more 
successful rivals, and empowering workers, once Saturn 
was forced to give up control to GM’s centralized control, 
it lost touch with the consumer. That lack of responsive-
ness doomed Saturn’s future and its potential to improve 
GM’s competitiveness.
• 
Assume your competition is irrelevant. Initially, 
Saturn’s leaders wanted to understand the options that 
customers weighed when they were shopping for a new 
car. This ability to view car buying through the custom-
ers’ eyes yielded insights for improvement in key capabili-
ties including product design, advertising, selling, retailing, 
manufacturing, and human resources management. Once 
GM lost Roger Smith, understanding and learning from 
Saturn’s competition became far less important than doing 
things the old GM way. And that way led to bankruptcy.

■
■Principle Two  Large companies seeking growth from new capabilities should build or acquire 
the capabilities needed to gain a significant share of new markets created by changing technology 
and evolving customer needs.
As we saw in the Apple and GM cases, companies seeking to take advan-
tage of growth opportunities often need to modify their current capabilities. 
However, in many cases capturing new opportunities requires a company to 
create entirely new capabilities and even siphon away resources from their 
existing capabilities to finance the new ones.
Few CEOs have the mentality required to accomplish this transformation. 
Indeed, since most public company CEOs are incented to exceed quarterly 
revenue and earnings targets, they tend to resist any strategic move—such 
as the one required to change the company’s capabilities—that would put 
the company’s stock price—and annual executive bonuses at risk. And this 
transformation is virtually guaranteed to interrupt a company’s ability to beat 
expectations and raise guidance because it will cause the company to spend 
more money while cutting into revenue from the market opportunity that has 
contributed to its current success.
Sadly there is no easy way to solve this problem—and that is why large com-
panies, hamstrung by their commitment to earnings per share targets—tend 
to underinvest in changing their capabilities to attack new market opportuni-
ties. A case in point is IBM which by the second quarter of 2016 had reported 
17 consecutive quarters of declining revenue. This was due to the fact that 
its revenues from old products were declining far faster than its so-called 
strategic initiatives—such as those targeted at the cloud—could take up the 
slack. Indeed between 2011 and 2015, IBM suffered a $16 billion growth gap 
between the $13.8 billion revenues it added from “strategic imperatives” and 
the $29.7 billion it lost from a decline in its core revenues.
The CEOs who have pulled off the transition to building new capabilities that 
take advantage of new growth opportunities are either the company founders 
or have prior experience transforming other companies. CEOs who achieve 
growth from new capabilities follow four principles:
• 
Stay alert to changing technologies, evolving cus-
tomer needs, and upstart rivals. A CEO must recog-
nize that a company’s current success is not guaranteed 
to persist—in fact success could impede the company’s 
ability to adapt to new opportunities created by these 
changes. CEOs must have this mindset to sacrifice short-
term financial success for faster longer-term growth.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
138
• 
Target growth opportunities. Such longer-term 
growth will only occur for the company if it targets a 
market that is currently small but will grow large quickly. 
Such markets are difficult to quantify so CEOs who tar-
get these opportunities based on limited data.
• 
Develop and defend product vision to capture 
market share. Having identified an attractive market to 
target, the CEO must envision how to capture a signifi-
cant share. To that end, CEOs must listen to customers to 
identify unmet needs, evaluate how well competing prod-
ucts satisfy those needs, envision a product that custom-
ers will be eager to purchase, and estimate the investment 
required to realize that vision along with the potential 
profit the company might earn from placing that bet.
• 
Reinvent capabilities to realize the product vision. 
Ultimately, such CEOs close the gap between their prod-
uct vision and its realization. To do that, they evaluate 
objectively—a difficult emotional challenge—the new 
capabilities the company must add in order to achieve its 
growth goals. If the company lacks these capabilities, the 
CEO must decide whether to build them internally—by 
hiring experts or acquiring companies that excel in these 
capabilities—or outsourcing the capabilities. Reinventing 
the company’s capabilities may also require phasing out 
the company’s current capabilities to help finance the 
new ones.
Successful: Netflix Transitions from DVD-by-Mail to 
Online Streaming
Introduction
After success replacing video stores like Blockbuster Video with its DVD-by-
Mail service, Netflix created an online streaming service built on a new set 
of capabilities—including content production and partnering with broadband 
service providers.
Case Scenario
Netflix got its start in the world by offering consumers an alternative to driving to 
a retail store to rent VCRs and DVDs. That alternative—dubbed DVD-by-Mail—
enabled consumers to order DVDs online, take delivery of their DVDs at their mail-
boxes, and return the DVDs by mail—without the annoying late fees charged by the 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
139
likes of Blockbuster Video. Netflix’s DVD-by-Mail service became so popular that by 
March 2007, Netflix was the world’s largest online movie rental subscription service 
with 6.3 million subscribers to a library of over 70,000 movie, television, and other 
filmed entertainment titles on DVD who paid monthly subscription fees starting at 
$4.99. Between 2002 and 2006, Netflix’s revenues soared at a 59% annual rate to 
$997 million on which it earned $49 million in profit.
Netflix engineered its operations to win the battle for DVD-by-Mail market suprem-
acy. Netflix was able to buy the DVDs in a retail store (copyright law allowed it to rent 
out those DVDs) and deliver them in a way that was more convenient for consumers 
than the immediate gratification they got from picking up DVDs at a video store.
In 2007, Apple launched its iPhone, which made Netflix CEO, Reed Hastings, realize 
that people would no longer be content to watch DVDs while sitting on the couch 
in front of their TVs. Instead, Hastings envisioned a world in which consumers would 
watch videos on their smartphones and other handheld devices.
Netflix struggled with how to survive the transition of customers who wanted to 
dump its DVD-by-Mail service and watch streaming videos instead. This struggle led 
to its highly controversial July 2011 pricing policy of raising prices as much as 60%. 
The new deal made customers pay $16 a month for one DVD out at a time plus 
Internet streaming—up from $10 a month for the combined package before the 
new rate went into effect for existing subscribers at the beginning of September 
2011. Netflix stock plunged.
Unfortunately for shareholders, the capabilities required to win in the online stream-
ing business were very different from the requirements for success in DVD-by-Mail. 
That’s because Netflix was in a much weaker bargaining position with the owners 
of the digital videos—it had to engage in painful negotiations with studios and they 
had no incentive to cut Netflix a break—especially after watching Netflix’s success 
with DVD-by-Mail. These higher costs showed up in Netflix’s financial statements. For 
example, by the end of June 2011, Netflix’s accounts payable had climbed 218% 
from $137 million at the end of 2010 to $435 million.
To its credit, Netflix did not give up with its online streaming efforts. Since studios 
declined to license online content on attractive terms, Netflix entered the studios’ 
business of creating content—referred to as backward integration. In February 
2013, Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told GQ, “the goal is to become 
HBO faster than HBO can become us.”
And that strategy paid off. Netflix’s first quarter 2013 results were much better than 
analysts expected. On April 22, 2013, its stock soared 24% in after-hours trading to 
$215.40—it announced that it had gained two million new U.S. customers in the 
first three months of 2013—reaching 29.2 million — which was 200,000 more 
than the average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg. At the core of Netflix’s 
success was its creation of a new capability—content creation that yielded its own 
popular series including House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
140
Netflix built its content creation capability slowly over a decade. Initially, it licensed 
movies from two premium movie channels, Starz and Epix. However, Netflix had to 
wait a year after the movies had played in theaters before it could get access to 
them and that lasted for 12 to 18 months. So it began licensing TV programs like 
AMC’s Mad Men and Breaking Bad for consumers who binge-watched the popular 
series. This was good for the networks since it generated revenues that partially 
offset their declining cable fees resulting from the rise of cord-cutters. And in 2012 
networks began seeing the threat from Netflix, which decided to start creating its 
own content. Using data about what content its users liked—David Fincher directed 
drama and actor Kevin Spacey, Netflix decided to buy House of Cards. Fincher 
agreed to a $100 million deal for 26 episodes. The show became an instant hit when 
it launched in February 2013.
Netflix also added the ability to partner effectively with broadband services provid-
ers such as Comcast—which was critical to the company’s growth since at peak 
hours, Netflix accounted for as much as 37% of total bandwidth consumption. In 
2011 engineers set up Netflix’s own 1,000- server content-delivery network. Using 
data on what shows users watch at what times and how long they watch the shows, 
Netflix can personalize its service—presenting users with content that is most likely 
to appeal to them.
Netflix achieved notable success with its streaming service while taking market 
share from cable service providers. Between its 2007 debut and July 2016, Netflix’s 
streaming service enjoyed a six-fold revenue increase to $6.8 billion from 81 million 
subscribers who paid $8 to $12 per month. And Netflix’s gain was cable’s pain—
during that time cable television lost 6.7 million subscribers. Moreover, in 2015, 
consumers spent 3% less time watching cable TV—and half of that drop was directly 
attributable to Netflix.
Case Analysis
While Netflix faces challenges ahead as it seeks to expand geographically, its 
success in achieving rapid growth through new capabilities reveals five prin-
ciples that Netflix used as did Adobe Systems, a supplier of software as a 
service to creative professionals:
• 
Solve the right problem. The first step in reinventing 
a big company is for top management to focus on solv-
ing the right problem. For Netflix, the problem was that 
more of its customers were watching videos on handheld 
devices. And for Adobe, it was the high cost of finding 
new customers each time it introduced a new version of 
its software. As Mark Garrett, Adobe’s chief financial offi-
cer, told the Wall Street Journal, “First is you can read the 
tea leaves, understand a problem you are trying to solve. 
Our problem was, if you go back to the 2008 recession, 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
141
we only had 5% of recurring revenue in 2007. Following 
its change to a software-as-a-service strategy, Adobe 
seemed to be getting customers to renew more fre-
quently. Explained Garrett, “Now we are well over 60%. 
That is a huge, positive change for us.”
• 
Rethink the entire business. In order to solve the 
right problem, top management must follow the advice 
of my MIT professor, the late Michael Hammer, and start 
with a clean sheet of paper to rethink the entire busi-
ness. Adobe did this when it changed to a subscription-
based offering. As Garrett said, “Start with a clean slate. 
Rethink the whole business. What’s the whole new strat-
egy? What’s the product line? It’s not, ‘Do I buy the car 
or lease the car?’ That’s just math. We had a completely 
[different] offering. That’s the only way this works.”
• 
Transform operations. A new strategy requires a 
change in operations. Netflix added new capabilities to 
implement its new strategy. And so did Adobe—building 
up its back office to give customers constant access to 
its service and changing how it measured those opera-
tions. As Garrett described the transformation, “A sub-
scription-based business model needs to be up 24/7. It 
needs to be built up. It’s different from shipping a shrink-
wrapped CD. That requires a lot of back office work.” 
In so doing, Adobe changed its systems, engineering, and 
key financial indicators. Noted Garrett, We needed to 
“rethink how [we ran] IT, how [we ran] engineering, [and] 
the metrics of the business from a traditional [profit and 
loss] business to whole new metrics to explain to Wall 
Street what the health of the business was.”
• 
Burn the boats. As a company implements the new 
strategy, it must explain the change to its customers 
and employees. And if the employees do not agree with 
the change, they must go elsewhere. As Garrett argued, 
companies that change their capabilities must “burn the 
boats. At some point along the way, you have to say this 
is the right answer and a new strategy. You can’t go back.” 
Adobe educated its customers about the change, offered 
them the new service, and then began to withdraw the 
old product. To educate customers, Adobe recognized 
that they would resist the change. Argued Garrett,” From 
a customer perspective, they are like anybody. They like 
doing things the way they’ve always been done. At first, 
you give them a choice of buying the old and new way.  

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
142
A lot will fall back and not move to a subscription model. 
But you have got to get to the point where you say to 
the customer, we’re not updating a perpetual product. 
It’s a major milestone.” With employees, Adobe was 
more direct in requiring them to get on board. “From an 
employee point of view, there will be some who resist 
change. They have to get onboard or leave, because 
frankly we are focused on this and this is the new direc-
tion,” said Garrett.
• 
Be transparent. Finally, Wall Street will be willing to 
give a publicly traded company a chance to reinvent itself 
if the company discloses the transformation clearly and 
then exceeds new performance targets. Adobe did this—
describing how the new strategy would hurt its income 
statement in the short run and boost it in the longer 
run. As Garrett said, “It was complicated for Wall Street 
to understand that you’ve got a perpetual model that’s 
going to fall off. The faster the P&L goes down, the bet-
ter you are as an investor because more people [were 
becoming] subscribers and over the long term” Adobe 
would be better off. Adobe gave Wall Street a new set 
of performance targets and exceeded them. ”Give them 
some long-term benchmarks to see if you are doing what 
you said you were going to do. Knocking these things as 
you go builds up credibility,” advised Garrett.
Unsuccessful: News Corp. Acquires Myspace
Introduction
In 2005, News Corp. paid $580 million to acquire Myspace—then a fast-grow-
ing social network that provided teenagers early access to music they loved. 
By June 2011, the romance was over—News Corp sold Myspace to Specific 
Media, a digital media group advised by Justin Timberlake for $35 million.
Case Scenario
News Corp. bought Myspace because it saw opportunity in digital advertising and it 
lacked the capabilities to take a significant share of that business. With Myspace’s 
then rapid growth—which accelerated soon after the deal closed—it appeared that 
News Corp. had made a brilliant move.
However, Myspace was not the only social network competing for those online 
advertising revenues. Myspace peaked in December at 75.9 million monthly unique 
visitors in the United States, according to comScore. By May 2011, that number had 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
143
dropped to 34.8 million—having lost about a million users per month in the prior 24 
months. The decline in users led to a drop in advertising revenue from $470 million 
in 2009 to $184 million in 2011 according to an estimate from EMarketer.
Underlying this collapse was News Corp.’s approach to managing Myspace, which 
put the company at a serious competitive disadvantage in four critical capabilities—
goal setting, product development, attracting and motivating talent, and marketing 
strategy.
Goal setting
Setting goals is the crucial starting point for strategy and there was a wide gap 
between the goals that News Corp. set for Myspace and what it needed to focus on 
to maintain its social networking lead. As a public company, News Corp. announced 
quarterly revenue targets to investors—and CEO Rupert Murdoch set and changed 
those goals without consulting with Myspace executives. Higher revenue goals placed 
a premium on boosting page views, which impeded efforts to streamline user naviga-
tion on the site.
For example, in early 2007, Murdoch predicted that Myspace would generate $1 
billion in revenue in 2008. This panicked two former executives, according to Reuters. 
As one said, “It was a big blunder to say that to the Street. When you looked at how 
Myspace's numbers had been trending it was possible—but it was a stretch. After 
that moment it was basically like all the tentacles of News Corp got involved in a bid 
to make that target, so getting anything done became near impossible.”
By contrast, Facebook avoided advertising and focused on accelerating user growth—
which it was able to achieve—soon surpassing Myspace. As venture capitalist Sean 
Percival explained, Myspace expanded into many specific industry segments such 
as celebrity, fashion, sports and books—to boost advertising revenue—doing many 
things badly. By contrast, Facebook focused on making the site the best at a small 
number of things that appealed to users and boosted growth.
Meanwhile, in 2007 Murdoch lost interest in Myspace—which had been his primary 
focus for a few years—when he turned his attention to acquiring Dow Jones. This 
pursuit culminated in News Corp.’s 2009 acquisition for $5 billion of the parent of 
the Wall Street Journal. As one executive told the Financial Times, “Rupert took his 
eye off the ball on the internet. He got obsessed with Dow Jones and stopped ­paying 
attention to Myspace. That’s when all the trouble really started.”
The June 2009 departure of Murdoch’s deputy, Peter Chernin, sealed the fate of 
Myspace’s formerly prized executives—such as its CEO Chris DeWolfe—since 
Chernin was no longer in place to protect them from Murdoch who hired former AOL 
CEO Jonathan Miller who replaced Myspace’s founders. In the year that followed his 
departure, Myspace lost ground to Facebook and suffered management changes, 
restructurings, and layoffs under News Corp.’s new chief digital officer; next year, the 
company would struggle through sweeping management changes, restructuring and 
layoffs, while losing more ground to Facebook.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
144
Product development
Product development plays a large role in determining whether a site grows or 
shrinks. While Facebook’s service was easy to use, lacked spam and seedy content, 
added a popular timeline, and a feature that made it easy for new users to add their 
email contacts to Facebook, Myspace was overwhelmed with content that repelled 
advertisers and users and it added too many new features—many of which further 
cluttered the site without attracting more users.
With the pressure to boost revenues to meet Murdoch’s financial goal, Myspace 
added “a dizzying number of features: communication tools such as instant messag-
ing, a classifieds program, a video player, a music player, a virtual karaoke machine, 
a self-serve advertising platform, profile-editing tools, security systems, privacy filters, 
Myspace book lists, and on and on,” according to the Financial Times. That put 
Myspace at a competitive disadvantage to Facebook, which was creating “a robust 
platform that allowed outside developers to build new applications.”
Attracting and motivating talent
The best talent is critical for winning the battle for market leadership. Myspace was 
originally located in Santa Monica and it moved to Beverly Hills after a few years. 
This move made it even more difficult for Myspace to compete for engineering tal-
ent—which was scarce in Southern California. Meanwhile, Facebook’s location in 
Silicon Valley—coupled with its ability to offer stock options in what looked like a high 
potential company—enabled it to bring in the world’s best talent.
While geographic location certainly put Myspace at a competitive disadvantage in 
recruiting, what really made the difference was that Myspace’s cachet had long ago 
expired while Facebook’s was rising. As The Guardian reported, “The baggage was 
too much. Users had too many bad experiences. They would go on there and they’d 
get hit with spam. There’d be all this weird stuff. On Facebook you were your real 
name, you were yourself. On Myspace you were like 420princessxxx, you’re all these 
weird pseudonyms.”
Marketing strategy
Soon after closing the deal to acquire Myspace, News Corp. signed a long-term 
advertising deal with Google valued at $900 million—but in order to receive the 
payments, Myspace needed to meet very challenging page view goals. At the same 
time, News Corp was opening Myspace offices around the world as a way to boost 
the number of users. Meanwhile, Facebook signed advertising deals that did not 
hinge on such page view goals and it was growing globally without the added cost of 
opening physical offices in new countries.
The Google agreement more than covered the price that News Corp. had paid 
for Myspace; however, the strings attached to the agreement put Myspace at a 
long-term disadvantage to Facebook. In order for Google to pay $300 million a 
year for three years, Myspace was required to generate a predetermined number 
of user visits. That reduced Myspace’s ability to experiment with its site since the 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
145
experiments might fail and let Google off the hook. News Corp’s Fox Interactive 
group—to which Myspace reported—pushed to meet quarterly revenue targets. 
“We were incentivized to keep page views very high and ended up having too 
many ads plus too many pages, making the site less easy to use than a site like 
Facebook,” according to Reuters.
Facebook was also able to take advantage of its relatively advertiser-friendly content 
to appeal to advertisers. While Facebook was introducing better tools for users to 
communicate with their friends through a clean interface, Myspace was unable to 
block spam—thus reinforcing its seedy image and causing “white middle class kids” 
to swap Myspace for Facebook. A large media buyer told Bloomberg that this was 
causing advertisers to quit Myspace. As he said, Advertisers, in general, have some 
difficulty with content and environments that they perceive to be edgy. Especially 
when the audiences that they value are available in environments that are less edgy."
Case Analysis
News Corp.’s failed effort to achieve growth from its acquisition of Myspace 
reveals four important principles of failure that will make it difficult for a com-
pany to grow through capabilities:
• 
Assume past capabilities will apply to new busi-
nesses. Success causes managers to repeat what they 
think worked in the past. Sadly, what managers think was 
the cause of their success may not be its true source. For 
example, Murdoch achieved tremendous success by hir-
ing Roger Ailes to start and manage Fox News. Murdoch 
assumed that his success with Fox News implied a simple 
formula—hire the right person and set ambitious goals—
would work again. Sadly for DeWolfe and Miller—both 
of whom Murdoch charged with meeting his ambitious 
goals—this formula was a failure when it came to build-
ing Myspace.
• 
Set unrealistic expectations. Typically a public com-
pany faces enormous pressure to boost quarterly rev-
enues and profits. That pressure can make it easy for a 
CEO to push responsibility for those goals onto lower 
level managers. And if that pressure is too much for the 
business to bear, it will respond by taking actions that 
are good for meeting quarterly earnings targets—but bad 
for the long-term value of the business. This is exactly 
what happened when Murdoch announced that Myspace 
needed to achieve $1 billion in advertising revenue.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
146
• 
Ignore competitor strategies. Rapid growth tends to 
attract rivals. And the fastest growing rivals pursue strat-
egies that other industry participants ought to study. If 
that examination of competitor strategies reveals a com-
pany’s weaknesses, the company should adapt. Facebook 
surpassed Myspace in part by applying growth strategies 
that News Corp. either ignored or noticed but did not 
perceive as worth studying. Rather than adapt by imple-
menting competitively superior strategies, Myspace made 
its service worse than Facebook’s from the perspective 
of demographically attractive consumers and the adver-
tisers who hoped to reach them.
• 
Weaken combined capabilities. Each industry 
requires different combinations of capabilities to grow 
faster than rivals. When a large company makes an acqui-
sition to obtain capabilities it lacks, the combined com-
pany ought to be able to perform those capabilities more 
effectively than either company could have previously 
done on their own. In retrospect, it is clear that News 
Corp. and Myspace were weak in several key capabili-
ties—for example, neither could outdo Facebook when 
it came to product development. And while News Corp. 
was good at selling advertising for broadcast TV, it was not 
as skilled in doing so for social media content. Ultimately, 
Murdoch’s overly ambitious financial expectations—and 
his impatience with the executives he charged with meet-
ing them—doomed Myspace in its race with Facebook.
■
■Principle Three  Small companies seeking growth from current capabilities should identify 
and attack untapped markets where their unique capabilities will enable them to gain significant 
market share.
Some of the most successful start-ups are run by CEOs who have extensive 
experience working with executives at well-established firms. That experience 
helps them to understand the strengths and weaknesses of those incumbents. 
And perhaps most important, helps them to imagine in detail how those 
incumbents might react to a carefully planned assault on their customers.
Such entrepreneurs can array their strengths against these incumbents’ weak-
nesses to design, market, and service new products that customers find so 
compelling that they are willing to take the chance of giving some of their 
business to a start-up.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
147
Such start-ups can achieve growth from current capabilities by applying three 
principles:
• 
Focus on customers who are dissatisfied with 
currently available products. Potential customers—
whether businesses or consumers—are hesitant to try 
or pay for a start-up’s product. The reason for that is 
simple—start-ups generally fail—thus stranding the cus-
tomers with unsupported products. A start-up’s best 
chance to overcome this reluctance is to offer potential 
customers a product that delivers a dramatically better 
solution to their problem than do products offered by 
current vendors. In so doing, entrepreneurs can boost 
the chances that customers will be willing to try—and 
ultimately pay for their products.
• 
Stress capabilities that deliver superior value to 
customers. New product development is the key capa-
bility at which most start-ups must excel. For example, 
if a start-up can listen with an open mind to customers, 
can envision how to use new technology to develop a 
product that will solve their problems better than the 
competition, and can build new products with a team 
approach that includes different functions—such as engi-
neering, sales, finance, manufacturing, and early-adopter 
customers—it has a good chance of building products 
that customers are eager to buy. Such an approach to 
new product development could give a start-up an advan-
tage over an incumbent that builds new products that are 
tied into all of its other products—with the goal of sell-
ing customers a complete bundle—regardless of whether 
that bundle solves the customers’ problems.
• 
Keep renewing capabilities. It has become a cliché 
that some companies founded to become the opposite 
of an incumbent end up becoming so successful that they 
acquire all of the bad habits and characteristics which 
they were founded to overturn. To avoid this ironic fate, 
entrepreneurs must maintain intellectual humility and 
bear in mind that if unchecked, the pride that goes along 
with success can blind a leader to changes in customer 
needs, technology, and the competitive playing field that 
turn their capabilities from growth drivers to growth 
inhibitors.

Successful: SailPoint Grows to $100 Million in 
Revenues through Superior Product Development
Introduction
Founded in 2005, Austin, Texas-based identity management software provider, 
SailPoint's exceptional product management and customer service skills pro-
pelled it to over $100 million in revenue with bookings growing at 40% a year. 
By April 2016 it had 530 customers and 550 employees with hopes for filing 
for an IPO in 2017. (Identity management software protects companies against 
hackers—think about the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures—by among other things 
controlling how new employees get access to computing resources when they 
join a company and revoking those identities when they leave.)
Case Scenario
In April 2016, I interviewed its CEO Mark McClain, who explained how he built 
SailPoint after two successful ventures. McClain joined Tivoli Systems as it went pub-
lic—and after IBM acquired it in 1996 for $743 million he ultimately ran its global 
marketing function. He also started and ran identity management software maker 
Waveset Technologies (Sun Microsystems bought it in 2003 for $150 million).
To explain SailPoint’s success, McClain offered five management imperatives that 
spring from its advantages in product development, customer service, and human 
resource management:
• 
Listen to customers with a “broader/forward” per-
spective. To grow, companies ought to listen to customers and 
give them what they need. McClain seems to agree—espe-
cially since changes in his customer's computing and business 
environments make it difficult for SailPoint to invent the future. 
So he meets with customers, asks them about their problems, 
and listens to their answers. He keeps an open mind—taking 
a broad approach and looking toward the future. Once he 
hears the same themes from many customers, he reaches the 
conclusion that it is time to act. So he gets different people 
involved, including engineers and product managers who syn-
thesize this feedback and build a prototype of a product that 
he thinks will solve the customer problems. He puts the proto-
type in front of customers, gets their feedback, and “iterates.” 
SailPoint's product development process contrasts starkly with 
that of big rivals who follow what McClain calls a “narrow/
backward” perspective. A case in point is IBM. As McClain 
said, “Big technology companies acquire companies that make 
point products. Their product managers fit acquired products 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
149
with their existing ones. They don't listen enough to customers 
and product managers can't get engineers to respond to new 
customer needs.” SailPoint's approach is winning it customers 
from the big players—half of its revenue is from customers of 
IBM, Oracle and CA Technologies, McClain says.
• 
Focus first on customers with the most pain. For a 
start-up, anyone could be a potential customer. Given its lim-
ited money and staff, the start-up should pitch its products to 
the group of customers that's most likely to buy. SailPoint tar-
geted industries that would be most vulnerable to hackers—
trying to create customers in “financial services, healthcare, 
federal government and later manufacturing and retail,” said 
McClain. You can grow more quickly by selling to the potential 
customers who will buy the most quickly because they benefit 
most from your product.
• 
Turn customers into raving fans. Growth can come from 
making a customer much happier with your service than what 
competitors provide. Outstanding service pays two growth divi-
dends—happy customers want to buy more from a company 
and sing its praises to potential customers. SailPoint turns cus-
tomers into raving fans. As McClain said, “We have a 96% 
customer approval rating. This puts us in the position where 
the customers are saying, ‘I wish you had more to sell to me, 
because you’re different than other vendors I deal with’. This 
happens by overinvesting in our customer relationships and 
customer satisfaction because it creates this virtuous cycle 
where they want to buy more,” said McClain.
• 
Use R&D and acquisitions to add new products. If a 
company has saturated its best customer groups around the 
world with its current products, where should it go next for 
growth? Get a bigger share of its current customers’ budgets 
by inventing or acquiring new products that customers want to 
buy? SailPoint did both—in 2015 it acquired an Israeli com-
pany, Whitebox Security, to help its customers “secure and 
manage unstructured data” like social media postings even 
as it introduced a new version of its core product. Doing this 
well requires a vision of how a company will stay valuable to 
customers. “The ultimate strategy is how we touch other parts 
of not only the identity market, but also enterprise security and 
the broader IT ecosystem,” said McClain.
• 
Attract great people and make them happy. Underlying 
excellent product development and effective customer service 
is the ability to attract and motivate talented people. SailPoint 

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
150
has done this as evidenced by winning one of the highest 
Glassdoor ratings in the world—including 100% approval 
from its employees. SailPoint hires A-players who share its val-
ues and enjoy working with other smart people. Thanks to 
SailPoint’s clearly articulated values, people who pass through 
its hiring process can take initiative to seize opportunities and 
adapt to change. SailPoint’s values are dubbed the 4-Is and 
include the following:
• 
Integrity “means delivering on the commitments we 
make. We base our relationships with fellow employees, 
customers, partners, and investors on trust, every person 
who works in or with our company—our customers, our 
partners, and to each other—knows they can depend on 
us to do what we say we'll do,” he explained.
• 
Individuals “refers to how much we value every person 
at SailPoint. We have learned that those who are confident 
in their abilities, yet humble enough to admit their 
shortcomings, make the best possible colleagues. As a 
result, we attract and retain the smartest, most engaging, 
most talented people in the industry,” said McClain.
• 
Impact “means measuring and rewarding results, not 
activity. While we do our best to ensure that everyone 
on our team has the competence, skills and knowledge 
required to succeed, we expect people on our team 
to deliver those great results with a great attitude,” 
explained McClain.
• 
Innovation “means developing creative solutions to 
real customer challenges that deliver significant, positive 
impact on the customer's bottom line. By combining an 
intimate knowledge of their businesses with our cutting-
edge knowledge of technology, our customers view us as 
a critical, trusted partner,” he said.
Case Analysis
SailPoint’s success in achieving growth from its capabilities highlights three 
principles of small company grow through capabilities:
• 
Empathize with customers. The most successful small 
companies gain an advantage over rivals by viewing the 
world through the eyes of their customers. This is often 
because the company’s founder started the ­company to 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
151
solve her own problem and saw an opportunity to sell 
this solution to others. Large companies tend not to be 
able to empathize with customers—or if some of the 
large company’s employees do empathize, their effort to 
respond to customer needs is muted by the company’s 
senior executives. As a result, small companies can envi-
sion products that better meet the needs of potential 
customers. SailPoint’s concept of listening with a broader/
forward perspective is an excellent application of this 
principle—leading to its ability to design products that 
customers are eager to buy.
• 
Cultivate capabilities that deliver competitively 
superior value to customers. Capabilities are a means 
to deliver value to customers at scale. More specifically, 
companies perform processes such as product develop-
ment, customer service, and marketing in order to design, 
make, deliver, and service products that are so valuable 
that large numbers of customers buy them repeatedly and 
recommend them to others. Capabilities enable compa-
nies to create and keep customers in a way that the com-
pany can repeat as it expands. SailPoint’s skills in product 
development, service, and human resources management 
have contributed to its competitively superior customer 
value—which in turn has propelled its rapid growth.
• 
Keep learning. Capabilities lose their value over time 
because of changing customer needs, new technolo-
gies, and upstart rivals. Unless a company stays keenly 
attuned to these changes and adapts, its capabilities are 
likely to turn from core capabilities into core rigidities. 
Small company CEOs seeking to avoid this fate—which 
will ultimately lead to slower growth and loss of market 
share—must empathize with customers while maintain-
ing intellectual humility. SailPoint demonstrated its ability 
to do this as it tailored its product to new industries and 
by acquiring a company that could deliver a new service 
that its customers were demanding. To sustain growth 
through capabilities, a CEO must be willing to keep learn-
ing—in spite of the company’s success.

Unsuccessful: Despite 100,000 Users and $1.6 
Million in Capital, GoCrossCampus (GXC) Fails
Introduction
In 2007, five Yale undergraduates started GXC—an online gaming company 
that raised $1.6 million in funding, had more than 100,000 users, and signed 
up over 100 institutions—mostly colleges and universities. By 2010, it had run 
out of money and shut down. Underlying this failure was the absence of many 
key capabilities needed to grow and operate a start-up.
Case Scenario
GXC was a “territorial-conquest game, like Risk,” founded in September 2007 by 
four Yale undergraduate students and one Columbia undergrad. According to the 
New York Times, “GXC more closely resembles an intramural or interscholastic 
sport than the typical online video game, where individuals or small groups are pitted 
against each other. GXC teams, made up of hundreds and sometimes thousands 
of players, play on behalf of real-world dorms or schools—even presidential candi-
dates—by jostling for hegemony on maps of their campus or locale and conducting 
their campaigns as much in the real world as online.”
GXC was based in New Haven and was seeking revenues from companies—such as 
Google’s Manhattan campus—seeking to build camaraderie among its employees. 
By March 2008, GXC had raised what was then an undisclosed amount of seed 
money—with the hope of raising more capital after they graduated and devoted 
themselves full time to building the game.
GXC sought to tap into intergroup competition at colleges and universities. As Brad 
Hargreaves, GXC’s CEO explained, “We try to harness the feelings of various com-
petitive groups in order to create really intense and enthusiastic groups of online 
gamers, essentially out of people who have often never played an online game 
before in their lives.” And its chief marketing officer Matthew Brimer said that GXC’s 
advantage over established gaming companies that might try to copy the game was 
its relationships with student governments who help in getting approval from univer-
sity administrators.
By March 2008, 11,000 Ivy League students were playing its game and its total 
number of players ultimately grew to 100,000 before GXC burned through the $1.6 
million it had raised. Its failure can be seen as the result of its weakness at perform-
ing three critical capabilities:
• 
Targeting the right market. Small companies should tar-
get large markets whose customers have significant unmet 
needs that their start-up can address more effectively than 
rivals. GXC did not realize the importance of this capability  

Disciplined Growth Strategies
153
until after it failed. GXC’s product was intended for college 
students with campus pride who enjoyed playing strategy 
games, most of whom had little money to spend on anything 
other than alcohol. This market was too small to build a sus-
tainable company.
• 
Raising capital for the long term. Investors, assuming 
that a company can win at most 10% market share, like to 
invest in start-ups targeting markets of at least $1 billion since 
they believe that in order to go public a company must gener-
ate at least $100 million in revenue. GXC’s target market was 
smaller than that so it was only able to raise small amounts of 
capital at very short-term intervals. As Brimer said, “We raised 
$300K for our seed round from New York VCs. Four months 
later, we raised $300K more. And four months after that, we 
raised another $300K, and four months after that, another 
$300K.”
• 
Developing products that meet user requirements. To 
develop winning products, small companies must work closely 
with customers—as well as cross-functional teams—to cre-
ate products with features that customers want. GXC did 
not work with the right customers in developing its product, 
the game’s interface was too difficult to use, and it failed to 
anticipate how rapidly growing customer demand would strain 
its ability to keep the game operating properly. For example, 
GXC launched its game in fall 2007 to capture the interest 
of students as they were arriving on campus—but technical 
problems forced it to shut down until Thanksgiving. Moreover, 
its developers lacked a product plan and they were only tak-
ing product feedback from friends and family to which they 
reacted immediately—so they did not make the right product 
improvements efficiently.
Case Analysis
The GXC case highlights three principles that inhibit small companies’ achieve-
ment of growth via current capabilities:
• 
Put founders’ interests ahead of customers’ and 
investors’. Some first-time entrepreneurs assume that 
applying the founders’ skills to their interests will be suf-
ficient for a successful launch. This can work if the found-
ing team happens to include people who are capable of 
understanding and addressing the concerns of external 
stakeholders such as customers and investors. However, 
if a team lacks those skills then the company’s direction 

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
154
will not be set effectively—or it will flow slowly from 
extensive internal debate among the founders based 
on the interaction between their shared interests and 
disagreements. GXC clearly suffered as a result of this 
problem and therefore it never recognized and closed its 
critical capability gaps.
• 
Build team that lacks the capabilities needed to 
gain market share. When start-ups seek to get off the 
ground, their founders ought to look objectively at the 
skills required to build a company that can grow. Failure 
can result if the team lacks critical capabilities because 
work that needs to be done to launch and grow the 
company does not happen. GXC’s team had people with 
vision and coding ability but was lacking in sufficiently 
strong capabilities in product development, setting stra-
tegic direction, and raising capital.
• 
Fail to acknowledge and adapt quickly to mis-
takes. Mistakes are inevitable—and a crucial difference 
between start-ups that succeed and the ones that fail is 
their approach to acknowledging, analyzing, and fixing 
mistakes. Start-ups whose founders believe that they will 
create and define their industries can fall victim to con-
firmation bias—which leads them to ignore information 
that is inconsistent with their vision. As a result, they dis-
miss market signals that suggest the company may have 
made a mistake that it needs to fix. As we discussed ear-
lier, GXC failed to identify, acknowledge, and fix several 
important mistakes—it picked the wrong target market 
and its team lacked critical skills in product development, 
strategic direction setting, and raising capital. It only rec-
ognized these mistakes after the company had failed. 
Successful start-ups do that while there is still hope for 
using the fixed mistakes to continue their expansion.
■
■Principle Four  Small companies seeking growth from new capabilities should envision new 
market opportunities and build, partner, or acquire the skills need to gain share.
When seeking to achieve revenue growth, well-managed small companies ask 
themselves a difficult question—Do we have the capabilities needed to meet 
our growth goals? The honest answer to that question is often ‘No”—but 
some entrepreneurs display false bravado and answer in the affirmative.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
155
An effective CEO will recognize that the company may be missing critical 
capabilities and will evaluate how to add them to its capability portfolio. Such 
an evaluation will focus on questions such as:
• 
Which market opportunity is best for our company?
• 
Which companies are growing fastest in that market?
• 
Why do customers buy from these growth leaders and 
what are their critical capabilities?
• 
What are our company’s strengths and weaknesses in 
each of these key capabilities?
• 
What are the best options—for example, hiring expe-
rienced management, partnering, or acquiring—to close 
our company’s capability gap?
Small companies seeking growth from new capabilities answer these ques-
tions effectively by conducting in-depth analysis—driven by business instincts 
honed from their founders’ prior business experience—into customer needs, 
growth leaders’ capabilities, their strengths and weaknesses, and options for 
closing the resulting capability gaps. This analysis leads to decisions and actions 
that generate rapid growth.
Successful: Five Years after Founding, Commonwealth 
Dairy’s New Capabilities Drive 100% Growth
Introduction
In 2009, Commonwealth Dairy’s founders applied their skills at identifying 
growth opportunities to the Greek yogurt market—growing 100% a year to 
$140 million in revenues by 2015. Critical to this success was the financing it 
received from Ehrmann, a German yogurt maker, which helped the company’s 
cofounders to add new capabilities including how to make, market, and distribute  
yogurt and how to manage the company as it grew.
Case Scenario
Commonwealth Dairy, with operations near Brattleboro, Vermont; and in Casa 
Grande, Arizona, made Greek yogurt that accounted for 70% of its $70 million in 
estimated 2013 revenues. Commonwealth made yogurt for private label retailers 
such as Wegmans, Costco, and others. They also sold the product under its own 
brand, Green Mountain Creamery. With help from YoYummy, introduced in late 2013 
as children’s yogurt in a pouch, Commonwealth expected to reach $140 million in 
revenues by the end of 2014.

Massachusetts entrepreneurs Thomas Moffitt, president and CEO; and Ben Johnson, 
vice president and CFO, cofounded Commonwealth in 2009. Both had left the same 
big-company employer, launching their start-up at the depth of the global financial 
crisis, which made it difficult for them to raise capital for their yogurt-making ven-
ture. Moffitt majored in biology and creative writing at Colby College and entered 
the biology PhD program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. While there, he 
started a small company distributing milk, juice, and soda. After a few years of “medi-
ocre success,” he headed back east. From there, he went to a food broker where he 
observed who was buying what and which categories were growing. From there, he 
took a job at Ahold, an international retailer headquartered in Amsterdam, sourcing 
dairy commodities and helping to manage the risk associated with purchasing the 
hundreds of millions of dollars of dairy it bought every year.
Johnson was a Boston-area restaurant veteran who had left that industry and 
returned to finish his bachelor’s degree in marketing at the University of Alabama. 
He stayed at Alabama to continue studying marketing for his master’s degree, and 
then returned to Boston. He joined Ahold shortly after Moffitt had started there, 
working on dairy contracts. As Moffitt explained, “Ahold is where I met Ben. It had 
six retail banners and a food service business. Ahold had been an aggregator, found 
its strategy not working, and began to sell off products and downsize. Ben and I were 
sourcing dairy products and saw opportunity. Ahold was buying 30 million pounds 
of yogurt a year, demand was growing at 10%, and the product options were poor.”
In 2008, the financial markets shuddered, which helped push Moffitt and Johnson to 
start a company to capture these opportunities. In so doing, they immediately recog-
nized the importance of partnering to supplement their experience identifying emerging 
market opportunities with the capabilities they would need in order to turn their vision 
into a successful company. According to Moffitt, “A light bulb went off in our heads. We 
saw Ahold doing more downsizing and that there was an opportunity in yogurt. We 
started talking to people, including attorneys in Boston, who introduced us to entrepre-
neurs. One of the founders of Staples helped us identify missing links in our plan.
Moffitt and Johnson first recruited a board of advisors to help them meet people 
and raise capital. This board comprised that they felt were the major skillsets a ven-
ture capitalist would want to see. The board members included a former secretary 
of agriculture, because they believed that the dairy industry was very political and 
there was a significant amount of government money for dairy companies; a former 
president of TCBY yogurt, a yogurt expert from the University of Wisconsin; a suc-
cessful entrepreneur who was between start-ups; and the owner of a company that 
built food plants. This latter individual’s personal guidance and involvement was a 
game changer for them. As Moffitt said, “These people meant that Ben and I could 
walk into any meeting and gain the respect of any audience we were speaking to.”
And they did not know how to make yogurt so they recruited someone who did. Said 
Moffitt, “We recruited a yogurt maker, an Austrian who was a vice president of Kozy 
Shack, a pudding-maker. He knew how to make yogurt and told us, ‘I was in conver-
sations four or five years ago about this with a German firm. I will give them a call.’”

In addition, Moffitt and Johnson raised capital for their venture in the midst of the 
financial market collapse from Ehrmann AG, a billion-dollar, family-run international 
yogurt company based in Germany. Soon, they were invited to Germany for a meeting 
with the Ehrmann AG board. “In September 2008, the worst part of the financial crisis, 
we made our pitch. For three months, we heard nothing. So we kept trying to find other 
partners, but Ehrmann had the capital and knowhow. In September 2009, we signed 
with Ehrmann and started constructing our dairy in Vermont,” explained Moffitt.
Ehrman was attracted to the investment by the opportunity to get a foothold in the 
rapidly growing market for Greek yogurt in the United States, which took very little 
time to go from infancy, to rapid growth, to attracting many new competitors which 
presaged its maturation. The U.S. market for yogurt grew rapidly from $5 billion 
in 2010 to $7 billion in 2014. But Greek yogurt accounted for $2 billion of 2014 
industry revenue was growing “at thousands of percent a year,” according to Moffitt. 
While U.S. consumers were behind Europe in yogurt consumption, they were catch-
ing up fast, increasing their consumption from “one-seventh the amount of yogurt 
that Europe does—to one-fifth,” he said.
But in 2013, the relative market share of industry leaders changed. Among the biggest 
rivals was New Berlin, New York-based Chobani, launched in 2007, which makes tart, 
Mediterranean-themed yogurt, and which claimed to have boosted revenue by 32% 
in 2013, and expected sales above $1.5 billion in 2014. The company, run by founder 
Hamdi Ulukaya, had a 19% share of the $6.5 billion U.S. market for refrigerated 
yogurt, according to Nielsen. And it controlled 38% of the U.S. Greek yogurt market.
This represented a growing revenue opportunity for Commonwealth. As Moffitt 
explained in 2014, “We will do $70 million in revenue this year and employ 150 
people—and we think we will hit $140 million in revenue in 2015 with help from 
YoYummy—tapping into the $1 billion kids’ yogurt market. And its expectations for 
the future were even more ambitious. The company had set a 2019 revenue target 
“in excess of $250 million.” Explained Moffitt and Johnson, “We would like to be in a 
position where we continue to create innovative, market-changing products and grow 
our market share. We are actively looking at new markets in terms of geographic 
distribution and product categories.”
To achieve these ambitious goals, Moffitt and Johnson added three new key capa-
bilities that enabled Commonwealth to attract customers, fulfill demand reliably 
for a high quality product, and build its organization as it scaled. These capabilities 
included the following:
• 
Yogurt Manufacturing. When Moffitt and Johnson started 
Commonwealth, they did not even know how to make yogurt. 
But by hiring an experienced Austrian yogurt maker, they began 
to build the company’s manufacturing capabilities. From there, 
they built a plant in Vermont that would make its premium, 
branded yogurt and a lower-cost facility in Arizona that could 
supply demand for lower-priced private label yogurt.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
158
• 
Raw Materials Purchasing. The economics of the yogurt 
industry were challenging and purchasing milk effectively was 
critical to their success. As Moffitt explained, “Milk accounts 
for most of our cost—it represents 15% to 17% of the price 
consumers pay for yogurt—fruit represents another 10%. In 
Vermont, we pay that milk price—80% of which is set at the 
federal level—to a co-op that represents about 1,000 farms 
which, on average, have 150 cows. Retailers get high margins 
on our product—they can mark it up 40%.”
• 
Managing Growth. As the company grew, Moffitt and 
Johnson needed to let go of their day-to-day involvement in 
activities such as hiring and other decisions at all levels of 
the organization. With a strong push from Ehrmann, they also 
hired professional functional executives and introduced more 
formal systems for planning and control. For example, they 
boosted the professionalism of their raw materials purchasing. 
“We have set up a Strategic Sourcing team to manage all 
of our Vendor relationships and ensure we are well informed 
buyers with clear authority for purchasing and not a company 
with lots of poorly trained buyers who buy at will and without 
a formal review of alternatives,” they said.
Given the rapidly changing nature of its markets, Commonwealth needed to keep 
introducing new products. In April 2016, Commonwealth helped launch into the United 
States an Ehrmann pudding that was popular in Europe. Would Commonwealth con-
tinue to be able to add new products and new capabilities in order to achieve its 
ambitious goals?
Case Analysis
The Commonwealth Dairy case exemplifies four principles that small compa-
nies seeking growth from new capabilities should follow:
• 
Know which capabilities are essential for winning 
in the target market. When a company seeks to take 
market share, it must understand each of the key capa-
bilities required to get and keep customers. When found-
ing Commonwealth, Moffitt and Johnson realized that 
they needed a range of capabilities—most of which they 
lacked. Fortunately, their industry experience and the 
resulting network of relationships made them confident 
that they could build the company—despite lacking all 
the key capabilities.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
159
• 
Assess objectively your company’s competitive 
position in each essential capability. It is com-
mon for founders to express great confidence in their 
competitive superiority. However the most success-
ful founders are able to gather data—comparing them-
selves objectively to rivals—so they can identify whether 
their company will truly enjoy a competitive advantage. 
Commonwealth’s cofounders had sufficient confidence 
and objectivity to realize that they enjoyed one competi-
tive advantage—the ability to see emerging new product 
opportunities before most rivals.
• 
Hire, partner, or acquire to close the capability 
gap. If a small company can identify objectively its capa-
bility gaps, then it ought to hire, partner, or acquire to 
gain access to the capability portfolio needed to grow. 
Commonwealth did an excellent job of closing the capa-
bility gap—its partnership with Ehrmann gave it capital 
and a management approach that helped it grow and it 
hired a yogurt industry veteran to lead its manufacturing 
capability.
• 
Reassess your capability portfolio for each new 
market opportunity. Companies ought to take a fresh 
look at their capability portfolios for each new growth 
opportunity that they target. Companies may find it more 
profitable to target new markets where a small number 
of capabilities must be modified and many of their cur-
rent capabilities will help them compete as they are. 
Commonwealth was able to accomplish this when it 
targeted the private label yogurt market—in so doing it 
chose to add a lower-cost manufacturing facility where 
it could make yogurt at a lower cost than it did in its 
Vermont facility.
Unsuccessful: HealthSpot Immolates $44 Million Due 
to Weak Capabilities
Introduction
In January 2016, Dublin, Ohio-based telehealth kiosk maker, HealthSpot, shut 
down after burning through $46.7 million in equity and debt capital. Its top 
management tried to apply its experience in health care technology to a new 
market. Its kiosk and the inconvenience and cost of scheduling appointments did 

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
160
not generate sufficient demand for the new service. Ultimately, this failure can 
be traced to a mismatch between the strengths of HealthSpot’s founding team 
and the requirements for competitive success in the telemedicine industry.
Case Scenario
HealthSpot, founded in 2011, made telemedicine kiosks intended to provide rapid 
access to doctors. By the time it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy four and a half years 
later, it had built 190 such kiosks that had been equipped with medical instruments 
and two-way video conferencing. Fifty-four of these kiosks were operating at customer 
sites including Rite Aid Corp.—its biggest customer with telemedicine kiosks in 25 
stores that acquired HealthSpot for $1.15 million out of bankruptcy—and Marc's 
pharmacies in Ohio. Over three years, HealthSpot had generated “$1.1 million in 
revenue—$600,000 of which came in 2015 as it delivered its kiosks to hospitals, 
pharmacy chains and employers.”
The most remarkable thing about HealthSpot was that it had convinced capital 
providers to part with $46.7 million. After all, the company’s CEO Steve Cashman 
had no prior experience in the health care industry—before starting the company 
he had been an information technology consultant. Moreover, HealthSpot’s top man-
agement team spent an inordinate amount of investor cash on their own sala-
ries—$1.46 million was paid out to its seven senior officers (an amount equal to its 
total revenues). Ultimately, HealthSpot failed due to its weak performance of three 
critical capabilities:
• 
Strategic Vision. Cashman’s decision to connect patients 
with doctors via kiosks in pharmacies was a deeply flawed 
strategy. Among the most obvious flaws was the notion that 
a physician would be able to diagnose a patient via a remote 
camera, rather than a face-to-face conversation that would 
include physical examination; the notion that doctors would 
benefit economically from providing this service—rather than 
increasing their professional liability; and the idea that patient 
medical records could be safely checked and updated on a 
kiosk. What is most remarkable is that Cashman was able to 
persuade capital providers that this was a good investment 
opportunity.
• 
Product Development. HealthSpot was able to design 
and build kiosks—when it went bankrupt it had 137 kiosks 
valued at $3.5 million in its inventory. However, kiosks alone 
did not address the consumer need for on-demand medical 
treatment that the kiosks implicitly offered to satisfy. That’s 
because HealthSpot required prearranged appointments—
therefore the kiosk promised to deliver a scheduled appoint-
ment with a doctor in a location that resulted in far poorer 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
161
quality health care than would meeting at a doctor’s office. 
HealthSpot’s kiosks did not offer patients or doctors any 
advantages over the means of delivering care that they were 
designed to replace.
• 
Marketing. It is difficult to sell a product that doesn’t give 
customers a compelling reason to buy. Despite his skills at 
raising capital, Cashman was clearly not as good at building 
a team that could generate sufficient revenue. With $1.1 mil-
lion in total revenue generated by the HealthSpot during its 
existence—representing 5,000 patient consultations by May 
2015, according to Cashman—the company’s marketing skills 
were deeply flawed. It is possible that what Cashman counted 
as patient consultations did not generate much in the way of 
revenues. Moreover, the significant number of kiosks that it 
held in inventory suggest that its marketing team was not up 
to the task of persuading customers to buy them.
Case Analysis
HealthSpot’s failure highlights three principles that small companies seeking 
growth from new capabilities should avoid:
• 
Assemble a weak founding team. HealthSpot’s 
founder had no experience running a telemedicine com-
pany nor did members of his senior team. To be fair, 
Cashman was exceptionally effective at raising capital—
yet in retrospect the enormous gap between HealthSpot’s 
failure and its promise suggests that the company’s capital 
providers lacked investment acumen. It is very unusual 
for a start-up with such a weak founding team to raise 
significant outside capital.
• 
Ignore key capability gaps. As we discussed earlier in 
the chapter to achieve growth, a founder must identify 
key capabilities required to gain market share and close 
the gap between the company’s current capabilities and 
those needed to win. HealthSpot’s CEO either did not 
see the need for product development and marketing or 
decided to staff those capabilities with the wrong people 
doing the wrong things. Without the ability to perform 
these activities in a way that delivered competitively 
superior value to customers, HealthSpot was unable to 
generate enough revenue to survive.

Chapter 5 | Growth from Current or New Capabilities
162
• 
Spend capital on executive pay. One key difference 
between large companies and small ones is top execu-
tives’ pay. In big companies, those executives typically 
make millions in base salary, bonus, and stock options. In 
small companies, they typically earn modest six figure sal-
aries and make up for the difference in the form of stock 
options that will only become valuable if the company 
is successful. HealthSpot violated this principle by paying 
millions in salary to its executives—thus accelerating the 
company’s demise.
Applying the Principles of Growth through 
New Capabilities
Leaders seeking to assess whether they apply these principles to their organi-
zations should be able to answer Yes to these six questions:
• 
What are the critical capabilities that support the fastest 
growing companies in your industry?
• 
How do these growth leaders use their capabilities to 
win new customers and keep them buying?
• 
How must your company modify its capabilities in order 
to accelerate its growth rate?
• 
Are there growth opportunities that your company could 
tap by applying its current capabilities?
• 
What capability gaps have you identified between your 
company’s current capabilities and those needed to tap 
those opportunities?
• 
Should your company close the capability gap through 
targeted hiring, acquisition, or partnership?
Chapter 8: Growth Road Maps provides a detailed methodology for applying 
the principles of growth through new products.

Summary
A growing company’s capabilities—such as product development, marketing 
and sales, manufacturing, distribution, and service—enable it to provide cus-
tomers better value than do rivals.
If a company has developed the right capabilities, it should use them to enter 
new markets so that it will be able to offset declining revenues derived from 
maturing markets with rising revenues from rapidly growing new ones.
In general, capabilities must be modified to fit with each new growth opportu-
nity. The profitability of these modifications will be highest if they both contrib-
ute to the company’s rapid growth and do not cost too much to implement.
If a company chooses growth through new capabilities, it will benefit most 
if the new capabilities give it a significant share of a market that is growing 
quickly and likely to become large. Moreover, the investment in new capabili-
ties will be particularly valuable to the company if they can be used to help 
gain share in a series of new market opportunities.
In Chapter 6, we'll explore the fifth dimension of growth—culture. While often 
dimly understood—culture is a set of values that underpin decisions such as 
whom to hire, promote, and manage out of the company and how people 
ought to act in their interactions with customers and partners. As we'll see, 
growth flows from a culture based on values in which the CEO believes, that 
talented people find compelling, and that motivate people to deliver superior 
customer value.

Growth via 
Culture
In Chapter 5, we saw how capabilities can help or hinder a company’s growth. 
In Chapter 6, we explore how a company’s culture—its shared values and the 
actions it takes to realize them—can contribute or constrain a company’s 
growth.
Many years ago I worked for a consulting firm that was known as the world’s 
expert in corporate culture. Given my analytical bent, I had difficulty at the 
time understanding what culture was and why it mattered so much. However, 
in the intervening decades, I’ve worked with many companies and witnessed 
firsthand the meaning and significance of culture—one CEO I interviewed 
spends 20% of his time on culture. Moreover, Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking 
Fast and Slow—which I use in my Strategic Decision Making course—pres-
ents a conceptual framework—System 1 (causes people to make snap, intui-
tive decisions) and System 2 (makes a choice after carefully analyzing its pros 
and cons). This framework helps me to understand that culture engages 
workers emotionally (System 1) and helps leaders evaluate decisions such as 
whom to hire, promote, and manage out of the company (System 2).

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
166
In teaching entrepreneurship students, I’ve seen that culture starts with values 
and that the right values occupy the center of a Venn diagram representing the 
intersection of three sets:
• 
CEO’s values. Effective culture reflects the CEO’s fun-
damental beliefs about what matters to other people 
including the founding team, customers, employees, and 
investors. If a CEO does not believe in the company’s 
values, they will become empty words—and any effort 
to use those words to influence key decisions will result 
in confusion. Moreover, a company is in for a world of 
trouble when its stated values don’t match the behavior 
of the CEO or employees.
• 
Employee magnets. The CEO’s values should also help 
the organization to hire and motivate the best employ-
ees. Simply put, a company ought to develop values that 
flow from the CEO and will help the company to attract 
the best people because they find inspiration in the com-
pany’s purpose and the way it operates.
• 
Customer benefits. Ultimately, values will only help a 
company grow if they attract people whose work is valu-
able to its customers. As we have explored throughout 
this book, growth flows from happy customers who keep 
buying from a company and tell others about their hap-
piness. A company should develop values that flow from 
the CEO, attract and motivate the best employees, and 
encourage them to perform activities—such as building 
products and delivering service—that help a company to 
get customers and keep them happy.
Principles of Growth from Culture
How can culture accelerate a company’s growth? A company is likely to grow 
faster than its industry if it develops values at the intersection of those three 
sets; uses them not only to hire and promote, but also to manage people who 
do not fit the values out of the company; and rewards employees who turn 
the values into actions that attract customers and keep them so happy that 
they strongly recommend the company to others. Culture can also slow a 
company’s growth—especially if the CEO feels compelled to impose her val-
ues on the organization without regard to their appeal to employees or their 
ability to drive behavior that attracts and keeps customers. Culture can also 
impede a company’s growth if the company’s stated values slow employees' 
career success. Such cognitive dissonance can lower productivity and high 
turnover.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
167
Large and small companies differ considerably in their approaches to achieving 
growth through culture. Most large companies are not run by their founders. 
Therefore, when a new CEO takes over, he may be faced with the significant 
challenge of reviving the company’s growth. As we’ll see later in this chapter, 
the key difference between a large company with a culture that encourages 
growth and one that impedes growth is the way it treats employees. How so? 
An effective large company growth culture respects its employees and eases 
their efforts to build new product prototypes so they can test out potential 
growth opportunities. Such a large company encourages experiments and 
even celebrates the learning that comes from failed ones. By contrast, a large 
company whose culture impedes growth views employees as costs to be 
minimized and encourages them to leave through layoffs, very limited salary 
increases, and ongoing pressure to outsource work to lower-cost countries, 
even as it cuts back on the quality of its customer service and builds new 
products with an eye toward locking in customers to all its products rather 
than delivering the industry’s best solution to customer problems.
Small companies take a different approach to growth culture—much of which 
springs from the personality of the CEO. A small company CEO should create 
a culture that recognizes the importance of hiring people who are willing to 
take responsibility for achieving the company’s growth goals and to express 
their opinions respectfully about the best strategy to achieve those goals. An 
effective small company growth culture urges employees to build products 
that deliver the industry’s best performance at the most competitive price, 
and they deliver excellent customer service so that customers will recom-
mend the company to others and keep buying as their needs change. By con-
trast, there are many kinds of ineffective small company growth cultures—one 
we will explore in this chapter is a company that believed that growth comes  
from hiring sales people and urging them to meet unrealistically high sales  
targets—trading off regulatory compliance and customer service in that pursuit.
Let’s examine pairs of case studies of successful and unsuccessful applications 
of two principles of growth from culture:
• 
Big companies seeking growth through culture 
unleash growth potential by encouraging employees to 
spot opportunities, experiment frugally, and take initiative 
to create new businesses.
• 
Small companies achieve growth through culture 
by hiring and rewarding people who value rapid prototyp-
ing, excellent customer service, and disciplined execution.
■
■Principle One  Big companies unleash growth potential by encouraging employees to spot 
opportunities, experiment frugally, and take initiative to create new businesses.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
168
Large companies often get that way thanks to exceptionally talented founders. 
Steve Jobs at Apple, Jeff Bezos at Amazon, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook 
come to mind. In many ways understanding how these icons of entrepreneur-
ship achieved success provides useful insights for managers. However, more 
ordinary CEOs will never be gifted with the genius—whether it be in envi-
sioning better products or challenging traditional ways that people interact or 
retailers operate—that enables such leaders to create and build fast-growing 
large companies.
In short, large company CEOs ought to create a culture that distributes 
responsibility for growth to all employees. Developing new products is risky. If 
any employee can build an inexpensive prototype of a new product idea and 
get feedback from potential customers, then the odds of success will rise. To 
create such a culture, a CEO ought to follow four principles:
• 
Study successful corporate innovation. A large 
company CEO ought to take personal responsibility for 
creating a culture that encourages its people to identify 
and develop new product ideas. Without the CEO’s lead-
ership, the company is likely to become too dependent 
on a small number of visionaries. To create a growth 
culture, the CEO ought to study how companies have 
encouraged innovation among their employees, the chal-
lenges companies have faced in achieving that outcome, 
how companies have overcome those challenges, and 
which ones remained unresolved.
• 
Adopt applicable lessons. The CEO must evaluate the 
results of this research and identify relevant lessons that 
the CEO can use to create a growth culture. From there 
the CEO should define the company’s values and articu-
late a vision of how that culture will encourage employ-
ees to innovate.
• 
Hire entrepreneurial leaders. Such a culture will be 
more effective if the company has hired individuals who 
are entrepreneurial leaders—that is, people who have 
started companies or who have identified and captured 
business opportunities. To generate faster growth, a 
company must be able to attract these talented people.
• 
Enable them to innovate. Ultimately the company 
must create a process that will enable such employees 
to imagine and develop new products—giving them ade-
quate resources with a minimum of interference from 
managers—and embracing the learning that comes from 
failed experiments during the process.

Case Studies
Successful: Intuit’s Culture of Innovation Boosts  
Employee Innovation and Growth
Introduction
Intuit, a $4.7 billion (2016 revenues) Mountain View, California-based personal 
financial software provider, grew rapidly. Investors who purchased shares in 
March 1993 at $2.64 enjoyed a 17% annual gain—as of October 7, 2016, 
the shares traded at $107.45. That stock price increase seemed to result 
from Intuit’s persistently rapid growth—for example, in the quarter ending 
January 2016, Intuit enjoyed 23% revenue growth abetted by a 49% increase 
to 1,257,000 of its QuickBooks Online subscriber count. Intuit’s culture of 
innovation helps explain that high growth.
Case Scenario
Intuit’s growth culture started with its founder and chairman of the executive com-
mittee, Scott Cook—a Harvard MBA and former Bain & Co. consultant. As he 
explained in a 2012 interview, he had a passion for assuring that Intuit was capable 
of both strengthening its core business and creating innovative new ones. His key 
finding was that big companies must create a culture of frugal experimentation.
By 2012, Cook—who did not see himself as a visionary innovator in the mold of 
Apple’s Steve Jobs or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and therefore wanted to make sure Intuit 
would keep growing after he left—had been studying for at least four years. He 
believed that no market category could keep growing for so long that an incum-
bent company could avoid eventually perishing unless it hitched its wagon to a new 
market. As an example, Cook cited Microsoft, which “had been unable to invent 
successful new disruptive businesses—causing its growth to slow down.” Cook found 
it strange that large successful companies could not invent new industries. After all, 
he reasoned, they have the best people, a high profit flow, the largest customer base, 
and the broadest channels of distribution.
And yet, Cook noted, if you look at enterprise and consumer technology companies, 
the game changing innovations almost never come from the big incumbents such as 
Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft. With the exception of Apple during Steve Jobs’s second 
stint as CEO, all the big innovations came from start-ups. Cook decided to investigate 
whether there were any large companies that had been able to buck this trend. He 
studied companies such as Hewlett Packard, 3M, Procter & Gamble—where he had 
worked, and Toyota Motor. He found that the common thread during the periods of 
their most successful product and process innovations was the systems they put in 
place to encourage employees to conduct frugal experiments.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
170
Intuit adopted this idea—inventing new businesses by creating an environment that 
encouraged employees to come up with new business hypotheses and test them by 
getting feedback from customers. Cook described an example—a debit card for 
people without bank accounts. An Intuit finance employee—not a “product per-
son”—noticed that the people who needed tax refund checks the most were often 
ones who don’t even have bank accounts. She envisioned the idea giving those 
people debit cards and having Intuit accept the tax refunds in its accounts and 
transfer the funds to the debit card. She came up with the idea in February and 
wanted to test it by April 1st before tax season ran out on April 15th. Cook criticized 
the kludgy website she developed but she argued that it was better to get something 
crude that would test her idea than to wait another 10 months. She expected 100 
takers but got 1,000. And the surprise was that half the ones that wanted the debit 
card already had bank accounts. In this way, Intuit discovered that the need for this 
product was much greater than it expected. One interesting feature of this story is 
that Cook was not wild about the website that the employee had developed, but she 
was able to pursue her idea anyway. This echoes one of Cook’s findings when he 
studied Hewlett Packard.
His conversation with the author of a 650-page book on its history revealed that 
seven of the eight big new businesses that HP invented came “from the bottom” and 
were opposed by CEO David Packard. The pattern Cook found was that in all these 
cases, three things were true:
• 
The company “liberated the inventive power of new people”;
• 
It created a “culture of experimentation”; and
• 
It changed the role of the boss from a decider of whether to 
pursue or cancel innovation projects to an installer of systems 
that encourage endless cycles of hypothesis generation, testing 
with customers, and learning from the gap between quantita-
tive expectations and measured market truth.
Cook believed that there was nothing more rewarding to employees than to see their 
idea being used by people. To that end, Intuit created an idea collaboration portal 
that let employees post ideas, get feedback, coaching, suggestions, and sign up other 
employees to help implement it. This idea encouragement happened without a man-
ager getting involved. According to Cook, by 2012, this portal had turned 30 ideas 
into “shipping products and features” that boosted Intuit’s revenues. Cook’s culture 
of innovation recipe consisted of eight steps:
• 
Leader’s vision. A culture of experimentation starts with the 
CEO’s vision. In Cook’s case, the vision was to change peoples’ 
financial lives so profoundly that they could not imagine going 
back to the old way;
• 
Strategy-by-experiment. Rather than trying to curry favor 
with their bosses, Cook believed it was essential to enable 
Intuit employees to make data-based decisions. This meant

171
encouraging them to conduct experiments—and importantly 
celebrating the learning that resulted from these experiments 
rather than harshly punishing failure—and collected data on 
customer behavior;
• 
Leap of faith assumptions. Cook encouraged people to 
identify the two or three key assumptions that had to be true 
for the idea to succeed—but might not be. Then he argued 
that people needed to test those assumptions with customers 
at a low cost in a very short time frame;
• 
Numeric hypothesis. Next Cook wanted people to come 
up with an estimate of, say, the number of customers that 
would order the new product;
• 
Experimental run. He expected the employee to run the 
experiment to test whether that numeric hypothesis was right 
or not;
• 
Analysis of variance. Then Cook wanted people to analyze 
the gap between the hypothesis and the actual results and dig 
deep to find the reason for that gap;
• 
Surprise celebration. Cook was adamant that people 
should not try to bury surprises to keep from being embar-
rassed but to savor them because they exposed a market 
signal that had not yet been detected; and
• 
Decision. Finally, Cook wanted Intuit people to make a deci-
sion about whether to pursue the idea or try a different one.
Intuit’s culture of innovation was still going strong in 2016 as evidenced by the 
company’s rapid growth in the number of users of its small business accounting 
software as a service, QuickBooks Online, which Intuit CEO Brad Smith initiated in 
response to a threat from Wellington, New Zealand-based Xero—a small business 
accounting mobile app—to QuickBooks, Intuit’s PC-based accounting software for 
small businesses. Xero started in 2006 based on the idea that Intuit had focused its 
attention on small business accounting software for the United States and Canada 
and ignored the rest of the world. And as small business owners started using smart-
phones and the cloud, Xero saw a chance to seize an opportunity to offer a mobile 
accounting app that would win over those small businesses.
Xero—which went public in Australia in 2012 and raised $111 million in 2015 
from U.S. venture capitalists—had 600,000 subscribers to its $9 a month app by 
2016. Rather than operate a closed system as Intuit’s PC-based QuickBooks did, 
Xero “opened up its platform so that banks and financial app makers could plug 
their services into it, offering users the ability to customize Xero and offering partner 
companies the ability to strengthen ties with their customers,” according to the New 
York Times. After establishing a strong foothold in New Zealand and Australia, Xero 
took its software to Britain and the United States.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
172
Intuit responded by turning a neglected product—QuickBooks Online—into a 
Xero rival—ultimately opening up the mobile accounting package to 2,000 apps 
like PayPal and Square and moving into Australia, a Xero stronghold. And in 2016, 
Intuit sold the PC-based Quicken and some other businesses to a private equity 
firm, raising $500 million. Smith developed QuickBooks Online as a rival to Xero 
through a previously established product line—focusing on building a product 
that would appeal to small businesses that were seeking to use an app for their 
accounting. Intuit was wise to keep its old PC-based business going—because 
many small businesses were still using it and it generated a substantial amount 
of cash to fund QuickBooks Online. As UBS analyst Brent Thill told the Times, 
“Whenever Intuit makes a wrong turn, they quickly get off the gravel and back 
onto the blacktop. That’s why the company has done so well for such a long 
time.”
Case Analysis
Intuit’s continued growth brings into focus four principles that large compa-
nies seeking to create a culture of innovation ought to follow:
• 
CEO must relinquish innovator-in-chief role. Most 
large companies that are still run by their founders could 
be at risk when those founders depart. To be sure, those 
founders savor running their creations so much that they 
cannot imagine stepping down voluntarily. However this 
mindset endangers the company’s long-term survival. 
Leaders who lack the innovative genius demonstrated by 
Jobs and Bezos ought to put a premium on their compa-
ny’s ability to grow after they leave. To achieve that, they 
ought to create a culture of innovation that lessens the 
company’s dependence on a single individual to identify 
and capture growth opportunities.
• 
Urge employees to innovate. For a company to keep 
growing, its culture must attract and motivate individu-
als with a passion for identifying and capturing growth 
opportunities. If a company employs such individuals, it 
can only tap their full value by empowering them to inno-
vate. Intuit’s culture provided employees with psychic 
rewards in the form of recognition and empowerment 
to encourage them to innovate. Other companies such 
as Google and 3M carve out 20% of an employee’s time 
to work on projects that interest them. Such intangible 
rewards encourage employees to innovate.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
173
• 
Remove innovation roadblocks. Large companies 
tend to place primary responsibility for new products 
in the control of a research and development depart-
ment—which imposes a highly structured process for 
approving and providing resources to competing prod-
uct development proposals. These formal organizations 
and processes tend to slow down decision making and 
to approve a small number of proposals—many of which 
have limited potential for commercial success. For large 
companies to create a culture of innovation, they must 
eliminate such roadblocks. Cook recognized that Intuit 
not only erected typical innovation roadblocks—such as 
blocking access to resources for employees to test out 
new ideas; but it also had not given employees a system-
atic way to think about experimenting frugally.
• 
Celebrate the learning that comes from failed 
experiments. The environment outside large compa-
nies—such as customer needs, technology, and competi-
tors—changes and in order for companies to adapt to 
that change, they must keep learning. Cook approached 
the challenge of creating a culture of innovation at Intuit 
with an intense focus on researching models of compa-
nies that have done so in the past. His scholarly approach 
reveals a critical principle for organizations committed 
to preserving such a culture—they must maintain intel-
lectual humility despite the successful growth that ensues. 
History has proven repeatedly that overconfidence inevi-
tably leads an organization to ignore external change—
the survival of a culture of innovation hinges crucially on 
a commitment to continue learning. Moreover, too many 
companies destroy learning and growth by harshly pun-
ishing those whose growth experiments fail.
Unsuccessful: IBM Bureaucratic Culture Shrinks  
Revenues for 17 Consecutive Quarters
Introduction
In 2016, IBM, the 105-year-old computing giant, had fallen from grace—shrink-
ing while its industry was growing. In the 17 quarters ending June 2016, its 
revenues declined every quarter on an annual basis even as IT spending rose 
at a 2% to 3% annual rate. Since taking over as CEO in January 2012, Virginia 
Rometty oversaw a 25% drop in revenues from $106.9 billion in 2011 to $80.3 
billion; a 25% profit decline from $15.8 billion in 2011 to $11.9 billion; and by 

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
174
October 10, 2016, its stock price had fallen 16% from $183.88 to $155 under 
her leadership.
At the core of its decline was a culture that hampered the effectiveness of 
IBM’s investments in growth. And that inability to grow was quantified by 
Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi who wrote in a February 2016 
research note, “IBM’s financials suggest that its strategic imperatives don’t 
appear to be improving its wallet share at customers—rather, since overall 
revenues are contracting, it suggests that IBM is not even keeping up with 
its customers’ shifting priorities”. He highlighted a $16 billion gap between 
growth from what IBM dubbed “strategic imperatives”—new products and 
acquisitions targeted at growth businesses that generated $13.8 billion in rev-
enue between 2011 and 2015 and the nearly $30 billion plunge in revenues 
from IBM’s old businesses.
A closer look at these strategic imperatives revealed that IBM was hopelessly 
behind in one and the other represented an opportunity that was too small to 
make a difference in IBM’s revenue growth. The first was the so-called cloud 
services market—estimated to account for $60 billion worth of revenue. IBM 
lagged far behind its rivals with little prospect for catching up due to its inabil-
ity to grow much faster than its rivals. Synergy Research estimated that in 
the second quarter of 2015, Amazon’s AWS business controlled 29% of the 
market while growing at 49%; Microsoft’s 12% surging at 96%; and IBM a mere 
7%—though increasing revenue at a respectable 54%. Meanwhile, IBM was 
proudly touting its Watson business—a provider of data analysis services—
arguing that Watson was “large and growing” part of its $18 billion business 
analytics business. However, since IBM did not disclose those revenues, inves-
tors had no way of knowing how significant Watson was—though Sacconaghi 
estimated IBM’s Watson revenues were below $200 million.
Case Scenario
A fundamental change in its culture contributed to IBM’s inability to grow. Under 
its most famous leader, Thomas Watson, Sr., IBM’s culture rested on three values: 
respect for the individual, the best customer service in the world, and excellence. By 
2016, a description of what IBM truly valued, based on its conduct, was approxi-
mately the opposite of the values Watson articulated. Before getting into the details 
of this analysis, it is worth reinforcing the general proposition that we have explored 
in previous chapters—rapid growth flows to companies that deliver products that 
provide customers with competitively superior value. Such products are the byprod-
uct of a culture of innovation—along the lines described in the Intuit case—which 
attracts and motivates the best people in the industry and enables them to bring 
their most viable ideas to market efficiently.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
175
Respect for the individual?
In 2016, IBM’s conduct toward employees did not appear consistent with the value 
of respecting the individual. For 70 years, IBM never laid off workers. If business 
changed, workers might be retrained and forced to adapt—possibly moving people 
across the country or overseas. According to D. Quinn Mills, an emeritus professor 
at Harvard Business School, Watson “believed people worked better when they were 
secure, not insecure. Watson “believed people would make a full commitment to the 
company if they knew they could count on the company to make a full commitment 
to them.”
This began to change in the 1980s, thanks to IBM’s ineffective effort to stop per-
sonal computers from taking market share from mainframes. By the time former 
McKinsey partner Lou Gerstner took over as CEO in 1993, IBM was running low on 
cash and he announced 60,000 layoffs. That marked the beginning of the end of 
IBM’s respect for the individual, which by 2016 featured regular rounds of layoffs, 
slashing employee benefits, minimal raises, and ongoing efforts to shift work from 
the United States and Europe to locations such as India that pay lower salaries. As 
Robert Ochoa, an IBM employee who retired in May 2016, told Marketplace the 
company is not the same, “It’s no longer respect for the individual. It’s respect for 
the stockholders.” As IBM’s declining revenues, profits, and stock price suggest, it’s 
not that either.
Indeed IBM’s lack of respect for the individual was anathema to a growth culture. As 
a result, IBM was not the prime destination for the most talented young engineers 
and scientists—they tended to prefer companies like Google and Facebook or took 
their chances on the most promising start-ups. IBM’s culture had repelled extremely 
talented engineers—a case in point was Shmuel Kliger. Kliger—who earned a PhD 
in computer science from Israel’s Weizmann Institute, was employed at IBM’s T.J. 
Watson Research Center when his IBM boss, Shaula Alexander-Yemini, senior man-
ager for Distributed Systems Software Technology at T.J. Watson, “where she received 
an IBM Outstanding Innovation Award for Optimistic Recovery for Fault Tolerant 
Distributed Systems”—and her now ex-husband, Columbia University professor, 
Yechiam Yemini—persuaded Kliger to bolt with them to start a company.
IBM’s culture repelled a pair of superstars. As Kriger explained to me in a July 2013 
interview, “I did not have the patience to do all the maneuvering up and down all the 
layers of IBM’s management needed to turn a patent into a new product that IBM 
would sell.” Since Kriger and Yemini were frustrated that their IBM research would 
never find its way into a product that people would use, they started a company—
event automation and real-time network systems management software provider, 
System Management Arts (SMARTS). In 2005, EMC bought SMARTS for $260 mil-
lion. According to Kliger, “SMARTS generated $70 million in revenue in 2004, the 
year before EMC bought it.” From there, Kliger became the Resource Management 
Software Group CTO at EMC—but it did not take. “I had as little power as EMC 
CTO as I did as a researcher at T.J. Watson,” said Kliger.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
176
He left EMC and in 2008, Kliger started VMTurbo—headquartered in Burlington, 
Massachusetts with R&D in Valhalla, New York (making it easier to recruit talent 
from IBM and Columbia)—based on Yemini’s idea of applying economic theory 
to IT resources. As Kliger explained, “Yemini had the idea of putting a price on IT 
resources—those that were not being used much would have a lower price than 
the ones that were stretched to the limit. VMTurbo is a control system that uses 
this pricing system to keep IT resources in equilibrium.” By 2012, VMTurbo was 
growing fast. As he said, “In 2012, our revenues and customer counts tripled. We 
expect both of those to double by the end of 2013. We are winning because we 
offer companies a rapid payback period on their investment. We charge them 
between $1,000 and $1,200 per socket and they recover that investment in three 
to four months.”
The best customer service in the world?
Indeed with its loss of respect for individuals like Kriger and Yemini, IBM lost some 
of its ability to create new businesses that would grow because they created value 
for customers. But the loss of talent—particularly shifting resources to India—
seriously degraded customer service at IBM. Oddly, the American Customer 
Satisfaction Index stopped measuring IBM’s customer satisfaction rating in 
2001—after it had declined from 78 in 1995 to 71 in 2001—Apple topped 
the list in 2016 with a score of 84. Shedding light on IBM’s relatively weak score 
is a story of a customer service manager whose company had been acquired by 
IBM. This manager stayed at IBM after the acquisition and was working closely 
with customers to solve their knotty technical support problems. But after IBM 
shifted that customer service work to India, the customers became extremely 
frustrated by the resulting decline in service. Customers were so desperate that 
they contacted him to ask if he could help, but it was no longer his job and he was 
thinking of retiring from IBM. While it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion 
about IBM’s customer service from this example, it seems reasonable to me that 
there is a connection between IBM’s shift of staff to lower-cost countries and a 
decline in the quality of its customer service.
Excellence?
Watson wanted IBM people to be the best in the industry by doing excellent work. 
One form of excellence that contributes directly to growth is whether a company 
makes products that outperform rivals in providing benefits to customers.
And on that front, IBM’s product development process systematically impeded product 
development excellence. For example, IBM imposed numerous internal requirements 
on its product development teams—such as requiring that products were usable by 
vision-impaired individuals regardless of whether there was strong demand for the 
feature; that software could run on mainframes—regardless of whether there was a 
large market of mainframe users for the product; and that the product was available 
in at least nine languages (again without regard to the market requirement). These 
executive-imposed mandates could consume as much as half of product development 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
177
teams’ budgets and time. As a result, too many IBM products become available to 
customers after rival vendors had introduced their products—and those late products 
offered customers insufficient benefits to compel them to switch from rivals’ products 
to IBM’s.
A case in point was IBM’s loss of market share in the $2 billion market for so-called 
identity management services, which keeps unauthorized employees out of differ-
ent parts of a company’s computer systems—in which SailPoint, a $100 million 
company founded by a former IBM executive, was cleaning Big Blue’s clock. As 
SailPoint CEO Mark McClain, a veteran of IBM’s Austin, Texas-based Tivoli, explained 
in a February 2016 interview, IBM had trouble listening to customers and respond-
ing quickly with product improvements that helped customers alleviate the real 
pain they were feeling. As McClain said, “Big technology companies [including IBM] 
acquire companies that make point products. [IBM] product managers focus on 
making the acquired products compatible with other [IBM] products such as data-
base software and middleware. Their product managers don’t spend enough time 
listening to customers and if a customer wants new features, they struggle to get the 
engineering resources to respond.” While IBM did win business because it had strong 
relationships with top executives and it bundled identity management software with 
other IBM products at no charge, SailPoint was growing at 30% per year and won 
in competitive bids against IBM 80% to 90% of the time. “We have 530 customers 
and a 96% customer approval rating. Potential customers want to see a proof of 
concept and we welcome the opportunity to shine,” said McClain.
These examples indicate that a culture of growth—along the lines of Watson’s three 
values—no longer existed at IBM.
Case Analysis
The most essential element of IBM’s values during the Watson, Sr. era was its 
respect for the individual. That respect was lost in the 1990s and its current 
absence highlights four principles that leaders should avoid if they want to 
create an effective growth culture:
• 
Focus on quarterly earnings per share targets. 
Companies that obsess over achieving quarterly earnings 
per share targets use cash to repurchase shares and to 
pay severance to fired employees. The short-term focus 
makes it difficult to justify investing in employees over 
the long term—and instead makes them fodder for each 
quarter’s EPS target. Moreover, this quarterly focus cre-
ates a powerful incentive to keep pushing outmoded, 
overly pricy products onto customers in order to keep 
revenues from declining.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
178
• 
Raise compliance with executive mandates above 
building products that deliver superior value for 
customers. Companies that focus too much on com-
plying with the wishes of senior executives run the risk 
of behaving insensitively to customers. Such lack of mar-
ket responsiveness is likely to cost the company market 
share—particularly if rivals exploit this weakness and 
deliver products that satisfy customer needs much more 
effectively.
• 
Persistently cut staff, reduce benefits, and push 
jobs to lower-cost countries. This focus demoralizes 
employees, repels the most talented people from want-
ing to join the company, and encourages people to focus 
their attention internally to keep their jobs. As a result, 
IBM has had difficulty attracting and motivating people 
who could develop new products that might contribute 
meaningfully to its revenue growth.
• 
Make cost reduction a more important priority 
than customer satisfaction. IBM formerly placed tre-
mendous emphasis on customer satisfaction. However, as 
we saw in the case scenario, IBM has made a practice of 
trading off customer service in favor of lowering its salary 
costs. The resulting customer dissatisfaction hurts IBM’s 
growth potential for two reasons: first, IBM customers 
will eagerly seek to buy from suppliers that offer better 
service than IBM; and second, IBM customers will hesi-
tate to recommend IBM to other companies.
■
■Principle Two  Small companies achieve faster growth by hiring and rewarding people who 
value rapid prototyping, excellent customer service, and disciplined execution.
Small companies are much closer to the edge of perishing than large ones. 
Often small companies have taken capital from investors who are so eager for 
revenue growth that they don’t mind so much if the company loses money. 
Burning through cash puts a company on edge—if investors decide that they 
are no longer interested in investing when the small company is getting close 
to running out of cash, the company’s survival could be at stake.
One of the most important ways to keep a small company growing is to 
ensure that its people are productive and working toward a common goal. 
A company’s culture can increase the odds that this will happen—and just as 
significantly, can keep out people who do not fit—and thus distract the rest of 
the company from what needs to be accomplished.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
179
An effective small company culture must be tailored to its CEO and the skills a 
company needs to attract and keep customers. To that end, a company ought 
to follow three principles:
• 
Develop the right values. At the beginning of this 
chapter, we saw that the right values for a company flow 
from the CEO’s beliefs; will help attract talented people; 
and will motivate them to design, build, make, deliver, sell, 
and service products that attract and keep customers.
• 
Attract and reward people who fit the culture. 
Once a small company articulates its values, it must act 
on them. And one of the most common ways that small 
companies use those values is in deciding which people 
to hire. And once hired, the company should promote 
and celebrate the ones who act according to its values 
and manage out of the company those who do not.
• 
Spend 20% of the CEO’s time on culture. To preserve 
a small company growth culture, the CEO ought to spend 
20% of her time on culture. This means that as the company 
grows, the CEO should make sure that all the people in the 
company understand its values because the CEO tells sto-
ries about employees who took actions that embody those 
values. Moreover, the CEO ought to spend time each week 
communicating with the company about how it is doing in 
pursuit of its aims and seek input from employees on how 
they believe the company ought to improve.
Successful: SimpliVity Execution Culture Propels 
over 100% Annual Growth
Introduction
Doron Kempel, the CEO of Westborough, Massachusetts-based SimpliVity—a 
maker of so-called hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI)—created a culture 
of excellence in execution that enabled it to sustain over 100% annual growth 
between the time it launched its product in 2013 and the third quarter of 
2016. HCI combined as many as a dozen data storage and retrieval functions 
into a single appliance that used a relatively inexpensive server to run custom-
ized software. The industry grew 137.5% to generate about $481 million in 
revenue in the second quarter of 2016. SimpliVity was founded in 2009 and by 
October 2016 had over 750 employees worldwide and was doubling its year-
over-year revenue with 6,000 systems shipped globally since 2013. SimpliVity 
had a reseller network of 1,000 partners in 73 countries, enabling the com-
pany to generate 50% of its sales outside of the Americas.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
180
Case Scenario
SimpliVity’s ability to grow flowed from its culture of execution. As former Kleiner 
Perkins partner Matt Murphy, who led a September 2012 $25 million investment in 
SimpliVity, told me, Kempel is “an execution machine.” In an October 2012 interview, 
Kempel told me that as a major in Israel’s Defense Force, at 26, he was a decorated, 
second in command of an elite unit, and led “meticulously planned and scrupulously 
executed missions far away from Israel and way behind enemy lines.” Following 
degrees from Tel-Aviv University and Harvard Business School, he started and grew a 
division of EMC “from zero to multi hundred million dollars in annual revenue.” After 
that, he partnered with the “technologically brilliant” Moshe Yanai to start Diligent 
Technologies. In 2008, Kempel sold Diligent to IBM—which called Diligent “the best 
run small company IBM has ever acquired.”
In setting up SimpliVity’s culture, Kempel articulated six principles of effective 
execution:
• 
Match the company’s strengths to its mission. If a 
company’s mission is to win in a highly competitive market, it 
must be able to build, sell, and support a technologically supe-
rior product and persuade customers and the market of that 
superiority. If the company’s skills are not the ones needed to 
achieve the mission, the company should either get those skills 
or pick a mission that it can achieve.
• 
Hire people who buy into a company’s norms. A com-
pany should hire people who are good at those skills and who 
eagerly follow the company’s norms. SimpliVity sought people 
with self-discipline, who were process driven, results oriented, 
and imbued with an entrepreneurial spirit.
• 
Let the best ideas win. Managers must encourage debates 
about ideas and let the best, fact-supported thinking win. 
Kempel made roles and responsibilities clear, but minimized 
hierarchy, a value he reinforced by occupying a cube, rather 
than an office. When Kempel gave a presentation to his peo-
ple, he expected them to share their skepticism and voice 
their opinions. If not, he encouraged them to do that afterward 
during a Post Activity Review (PAR). His goal was to reinforce 
risk taking and to depersonalize failure—using it as an oppor-
tunity to learn and improve.
• 
Motivate the right operating style. Kempel used a quar-
terly Alignment By Objective (ABO) process to reinforce behav-
ioral norms that could account for 10 percent to 15 percent 
of a person’s bonus. For example, a manager might have an 
ABO related to communication. Kempel gave the example of a 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
181
team member who wanted to learn how to disagree with her 
manager. He influenced her and her manager to assume ABO 
quarterly goals—for his part, “the manager would encourage 
her and she would express at least three unpopular views per 
quarter.” The lesson here was that a company would get more 
out of its people if it respected their views.
• 
Make action item tracking the company’s life blood. 
Kempel believed that SimpliVity should keep track of the tasks 
people had agreed to complete to achieve the company’s mis-
sion—what he called “action item accountability.” An action 
item was a team member’s specific, measurable, time-stamped 
goal that she agreed on with her manager. SimpliVity trained 
managers how to define and track them. After all “if action 
items are not recorded, tracked and measured, our whole 
spirit of execution will be undermined,” explained Kempel. He 
and his managers used an “action item log” to keep track of 
whether the goal was achieved, on time and as specified—and 
what the company “learned from deviations.” A company with-
out such an obsessive focus on tracking the achievement of 
goals was likely to slip behind those that did in Kempel’s view.
• 
Lead by example. Despite all the processes, nothing was 
more compelling than the power of leaders to influence others 
through their actions. “In 35 years of leadership and man-
agement—in sports, military and business—I have seen no 
substitute for leadership by example. If the managers and 
leaders do not live, breathe and exemplify the norms, then the 
execution system will fail,” Kempel said.
Two customers offer anecdotal evidence that SimpliVity’s culture contributed to its 
growth.
As Kempel explained in an October 2016 interview, “We have a global 50 customer 
[a financial services firm] that consolidated six global data-centers down to just 
three; and displaced all legacy storage products with our HCI product. This company 
anticipates that our product will enable it to cut capital and operating expenditures 
by $100 million over five years and reduce its floor space by a factor of 10.”
Another customer, The Container Store, sounded quite satisfied with SimpliVity. Its 
Platforms director Jay Whering said, “We evaluated a number of vendors—both 
hyperconverged and legacy. What we found with SimpliVity, and why we chose it 
over Nutanix, was that SimpliVity offered a far more complete solution—not just 
storage, but all data services, including built-in data protection, WAN optimization, 
and more. This was something no other company was offering, and is still unique to 
SimpliVity to this day. We are incredibly happy with our decision to go with SimpliVity 
and have felt the benefits of the solution throughout our entire business.”

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
182
Indeed Kempel argued that this breadth of functionality is helping it win bids from 
rivals. “When we bid against competitors including Nutanix and EMC, we win 80% 
of the time because we offer customers more—not just storage, but enterprise-
grade backup and native deduplication. Our faster growth springs from several fac-
tors: our value-added resellers (VARs) are engaged; we are doing more large deals; 
we have more repeat business in large enterprises and we are unique in just selling 
software—offering it on x86 servers from Cisco, Lenovo and Dell. In 2017, we expect 
that over 80% of our revenues will come from software. Though our per-customer 
revenues may be lower than they would be had we also sold low-margin hardware, 
we enjoy very high software gross margins,” he said.
In January 2017,SimpliVity’s culture of execution met with a mixed end when 
Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced plans to but the company for $650 million 
in cash. While this was more than the estimated $200 million IBM paid for his previ-
ous startup, it fell short of Kempel’s goal of an IPO and the $3.9 billion that HPE was 
rumored to be planning to pay in November 2016.1
Case Analysis
SimpliVity offers insights into how a small company can create a growth cul-
ture. While it would be difficult for most CEOs to achieve SimpliVity’s results, 
the success of its culture suggests four general principles for small-company 
CEOs seeking to growth through culture:
• 
Develop the right values. As we have already discussed, 
developing the right values is essential. In SimpliVity’s case, it 
is clear that its CEO was quite accustomed to setting very 
ambitious goals and building and leading teams that could 
achieve them. When SimpliVity got started, the goal was 
to deliver a product that would save companies significant 
amounts of money and inefficiency in managing their data.
• 
Hire people who fit with the values. SimpliVity used 
its values to hire people that it believed would be eager 
to act according to its values. It is difficult to make sure 
that all employees will fit with the values before they are 
on-board. However, conducting early interviews that test 
whether potential hires will be able to act according to the 
company’s values is a good place to start. If people who do 
not fit are told early in the process, a company can at least 
be more efficient in its pursuit of the right people.

• 
Set goals that drive people to attract and retain 
customers. Between hiring people and setting goals for 
them, there is much work that leaders must do. Specifically, 
CEOs ought to choose a business strategy, identify key 
skills the company needs, and decide who within each skill 
area should be responsible for which goals.
• 
Monitor achievement of the goals. An effec-
tive growth culture is good at using processes to keep 
track of what people promised to do in pursuit of those 
goals along with whether they actually delivered results. 
SimpliVity seems to have done this better than most 
companies—and they ought to learn from its approach.
Unsuccessful: Growth-at-Any-Cost Culture  
Collapses Zenefits
Introduction
In Chapter 1, we saw an example of a large pharmaceutical company Valeant 
that achieved very rapid growth boosting revenue, stock price, and executive 
compensation by acquiring well-established drugs with limited competition 
and raising prices dramatically. Along the way, it came to light that Valeant had 
a tainted relationship with a distributor that—when combined with account-
ing irregularities—threw into question its financial results and resulted in forc-
ing out Michael Pearson, the CEO behind Valeant’s undisciplined growth.
Small companies are equally capable of pursuing a culture of undisciplined 
growth. Zenefits is a San Francisco-based software company that provides 
small businesses with an app that replaces a company’s benefits department. 
In exchange for software, Zenefits gets a commission on health insurance that 
its clients purchase via its software. Ben Horowitz, cofounder of Andreessen 
Horowitz, which, with another venture capital firm, Institutional Venture 
Partners, invested $66.5 million in Zenefits valuing the company at $500 mil-
lion in the summer of 2014 said, “It’s the ultimate entrepreneur tool. How do 
you deal with anything that is very complicated that you need to learn about 
to be in business? Are you really going to go learn about the Affordable Care 
Act? Probably not. Once you have Zenefits, that’s it. You’re compliant.” One 
customer—Justin Winter, cofounder of Diamond Candles, an online store 
based in Durham, North Carolina—explained Zenefits’s appeal. “The tradi-
tional brokers came here and we had a face-to-face meeting, and they were 
knowledgeable and very nice. But we’re getting so many extra bonuses with 
Zenefits for the exact same price, we had to choose them,” said Winter.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture

Case Scenario
In 2014, Zenefits was thought to be one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon 
Valley and it had raised $500 million in capital at a valuation of $4 billion. But by 
2016, its CEO Parker Conrad had been fired after it was discovered that he had 
written software that enabled Zenefits employees to cheat on their health insurance 
brokerage licensing exam. Conrad—who was forced to take a leave of absence from 
Harvard College because he neglected his studies in favor of editing the Harvard 
Crimson—had subsequently been fired from SigFig, a portfolio management start-
up he cofounded.
When he started Zenefits in 2013, he was terrified of failing again so he built the 
company around an obsession with meeting very aggressive growth goals—putting 
employee satisfaction and regulatory compliance far down on its list of values. Its 
revenue and employee counts grew dramatically. Between 2013 and 2016, Zenefits’ 
headcount soared from 15 to 1,600. From $1 million by the end of 2013, the compa-
ny’s revenue hit $20 million by late 2014, and was projected to reach $100 million by 
late 2015—but it fell short by $30 million. Employees were jammed into office space 
with limited training and heavy drinking—beer kegs in its Scottsdale, Arizona, offices 
flowed during the workday—was coupled with an obsession with meeting sales goals.
Operational problems abounded. Zenefits was bringing in new customers far more 
quickly than it could enter them into its computer system, thus making customers 
frustrated As Conrad said, “It was a 5-pound-bag, 10-pounds-of-poop problem. Every 
day, we were able to load six to eight companies, but we were signing up 16 to 18. 
[There was a backlog of more than a month and a half.] It was a company-ending 
thing.” Employees received low salaries coupled with promises of raises when funding 
came through—Zenefits raised $500 million at a $4 billion valuation in 2015—but 
people never received the promised raises.
Conrad was ultimately tossed out by Zenefits’s board, replaced by chief operating 
officer David Sacks, in February 2016 when insurance regulators in California and 
Washington State discovered software that Conrad created to let Zenefits’s employ-
ees cheat on the state’s insurance broker license course. Sacks tried to change 
Zenefits’s culture from “Ready, Fire, Aim” to “Operate with Integrity.” Sacks tried to 
counter Zenefits’s perception problem with a culture of “radical candor,” he dubbed 
“Admit, fix, settle and repeat.” He fired several executives who embodied Zenefits’s 
fast-growth-at-any-cost culture and agreed with investors to slash the company’s 
valuation in half to $2 billion. By October 2016, it was unclear whether Zenefits 
would survive or rivals with better growth cultures would usurp its customers.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
185
Case Analysis
The Zenefits case highlights three principles that small companies seeking 
growth through culture should avoid:
• 
Use company to heal CEO’s psychological wounds. 
As we explored earlier in this chapter, a small company’s 
founder is an important source of its values. If a CEO 
has suffered psychological wounds from previous experi-
ence, there is a danger that he will use his latest start-up 
to heal them. And it appears as though Conrad’s fear of 
failing—as he saw himself having done at Harvard and 
SigFig—instilled a deep fear of failure that motivated him 
to create a culture that valued rapid growth above all 
other considerations. As with many previous companies, 
such as Enron or Valeant, that culture yielded trouble.
• 
Base culture on what CEO thinks investors want. 
Investors are an important stakeholder of a small com-
pany—but a CEO who places their interest far above 
those of customers and employees is likely to endanger 
the company’s long-term survival. CEOs must recognize 
their responsibility to push back against investor appe-
tite for growth. Since Conrad was so eager to enrich his 
investors and himself—and perhaps to redeem himself in 
his own eyes—he decided to create a culture that would 
push the interests of only one stakeholder.
• 
Ignore the needs of employees, regulators, and 
customers. Such a culture led Conrad to hire people 
aggressively and urge them desperately to bring in new 
customers. Important management imperatives such as 
paying people competitive salaries, satisfying regulatory 
requirements, and upgrading operations to sustain high 
levels of customer satisfaction and boost customers’ will-
ingness to refer the company to others were all neglected. 
Conrad mistakenly assumed that rapid revenue growth 
would wash away all these problems. History shows that 
these problems eventually surface and severely threaten 
the company’s survival.

Chapter 6 | Growth via Culture
186
Applying the Principles of Growth through 
Culture
Leaders seeking to grow through culture should ponder these five questions:
• 
Should I spend 20% of my time on our company’s culture?
• 
Do our values reflect what I believe, what should be 
important to our people, and what will encourage them to 
deliver the industry’s best products and customer service?
• 
Do we use our values to hire, promote, and manage peo-
ple out of the company?
• 
As our company grows, do all our employees understand 
and act in ways consistent with our culture?
• 
If I am contributing to a culture that impedes growth, how 
can I find a leader who will overcome those impediments?
Chapter 8: Growth Road Maps provides a detailed methodology for applying 
the principles of growth through culture.
Summary
Growth through culture flows from an organization that has the right values 
and uses those values to hire the best people and motivate them to achieve 
ambitious goals in a sustainable manner. Since culture is largely a reflection of 
the CEO’s personality, a company’s board must assess carefully whether a new 
CEO will be more likely to create a culture based on values in which the CEO 
believes passionately that appeal to highly talented employees and that will 
encourage those employees to make decisions that result in industry-leading 
products and outstanding customer service. Such a culture can contribute to 
a company’s rapid growth over the long term only if the CEO keeps evaluat-
ing its effectiveness and fixes its flaws as customer needs, technology, and the 
company’s rivals change.
In the next chapter, we introduce the concept of growth trajectories—how 
companies chain together various combinations of the five dimensions of 
growth over time. In so doing, we examine growth insights drawn from a 
large database of public companies. We then examine growth trajectories of 
successful and unsuccessful companies—synthesizing general principles that 
leaders can use to guide their development of effective growth trajectories.

Growth 
Trajectories
To sustain a company’s growth over time, leaders must chain together growth 
trajectories from the five dimensions we examined in Chapters 2 through 6. 
The most growth trajectories tap revenue from a dimension in which the com-
pany currently participates and invests in new ones from which it will grow in 
the future. For example, consider the following five-vector growth trajectory:
• 
Customer segment. A company starts by selling its ini-
tial product to a specific group of customers—and seeks 
to gain as large a share of that customer group’s growth 
as it can before its demand begins to become saturated.
• 
New geography. The next link in this company’s growth 
trajectory may be to target the same customer group in 
new geographies by forging distribution partnerships in 
those locations or building local sales and marketing forces.
• 
New products. This company’s third link might be to 
identify unmet needs among its current customers and 
develop or acquire new products that it can sell to those 
customers.
• 
New capabilities. Next the company might develop 
new capabilities or modify current ones in order to 
capture new growth opportunities created by changing 
technologies.

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
190
• 
New culture. While a change in culture may be difficult 
to trace directly to changes in a company’s growth rate, 
each time a company changes its CEO, its culture is likely 
to change. And if the new culture follows the principles 
outlined in Chapter 6, it is likely to accelerate growth.
Principles of Effective Growth Trajectories
While different growth trajectories have proven effective for large and small 
companies, the general approach of refining a company’s business strategy 
within a focused customer group and subsequently expanding it to more 
geographies is quite common. In Chapter 7, we compare two large company 
case studies—Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Yahoo—to illustrate the differ-
ence between the fastest growing 5% of Forbes 2000 companies and the 5% 
most rapidly declining ones. We also compare a small company that grew 
quickly and ultimately went public in 2016 and contrast that with another 
small company that reached $100 million in revenue as a private company 
before imploding short of an IPO and ultimately being sold to a rival for an 
undisclosed price.
CEOs that choose effective growth trajectories— whether of large or small 
companies—are generally skilled at product development and excel at adding 
new capabilities—such as marketing and manufacturing—that the company 
requires in order to turn its initial product success into substantial revenue 
growth.
Large and small companies do differ importantly in their approach to build-
ing growth trajectories. The major difference is that small company CEOs 
are often intensely focused on achieving rapid growth as they reach for the 
$100 million revenue benchmark often considered the minimum revenue level 
required to go public. While some CEOs who preside over growth from 
founding to IPO stay with the company—Jeff Bezos at Amazon is a promi-
nent example—a large number of such founders take their winnings and do 
other things. Therefore, the growth trajectories they choose generally involve 
focusing on a specific customer group—ideally one representing a market 
opportunity of at least $1 billion—with a product that those customers are 
eager to buy and then expanding globally to find more such customers in 
new geographies. As we will see in this chapter, data storage appliance maker 
Nutanix boosted customers’ productivity and helped them adapt to changing 
business needs while app marketer Fiksu saved app developers money but was 
too easy for rivals to surpass and for a key partner to stifle.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
191
Large companies must appoint CEOs who can identify new growth curves 
and invest in new products or acquisitions that can take a significant share of 
that new growth while creating a culture that encourages employees to iden-
tify and capture growth opportunities that they observe through their work 
with customers. While new products are generally the best avenue for new 
growth, large companies ought to consider acquisitions if they are analyzed 
using four tests for successful acquisitions. Moreover, even if these acquisitions 
succeed in adding sufficient profit to more than offset their purchase price, 
large companies must also foster a culture that stimulates employee creativ-
ity and initiative—leading to organic revenue growth. As we will see in this 
­chapter, Alexion Pharmaceuticals did these things well whereas Yahoo made 
many acquisitions that failed and created a culture that stifled innovation.
Let’s examine pairs of case studies of successful and unsuccessful applications 
of two principles of building effective growth trajectories:
• 
Large companies building effective growth tra-
jectories expand from start-up to large growing public 
company by chaining together growth vectors in a way 
that sustains industry-leading growth.
• 
Small companies building effective growth trajec-
tories expand initial product success within a customer 
group to new geographies.
■
■Principle One  Large companies expand from start-up to large growing public company by 
chaining together growth vectors in a way that sustains industry-leading growth.
Case Studies
The case studies in this book reveal a basic truth—a company’s ability to 
sustain industry-leading growth depends heavily on its CEO. If a CEO leads a 
company to superior growth over a period of decades, a new CEO is hardly 
guaranteed to sustain that growth. What’s more, despite its best efforts, it 
is difficult for a company’s board to be fully confident that its pick for a new 
CEO will be able to sustain the company’s growth. Even if a board is fortunate 
enough to have overseen the performance of a successful CEO, the skills that 
this CEO exercised to sustain rapid growth in the past may be very different 
from the skills needed to keep that company growing rapidly in future decades 
by that CEO’s successor.

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
192
Despite all these difficulties, a company’s long-term success depends on 
­making the right CEO choice—which means that a board needs guidance. To 
sustain the company’s industry-leading growth, a board should seek a CEO 
who can do the following:
• 
Match a value-creating product to a specific cus-
tomer group’s unmet need. In order to get off the 
ground, a company must pick a group of customers 
whose needs are not being met by incumbent vendors 
and build a product that satisfies their needs so well that 
customers are eager to buy it. Often founders start a 
company with a specific technical expertise—however 
they are unsure of how to match that knowledge to a 
significant unmet need. Boards should focus on CEO can-
didates who demonstrate a willingness to experiment 
frugally with different possible product/market matches 
to discover one or two that work before the company 
runs out of money.
• 
Sell that product to new geographies and/or to 
new customer groups. Should a CEO satisfy that first 
test, the next challenge is to sustain that product’s sales 
by seeking out new customers residing in new geogra-
phies and/or belonging to new customer groups that are 
similarly eager to buy the company’s product. Boards 
should appoint a CEO with previous experience exploit-
ing these twin growth vectors to achieve a rapid increase 
in revenue growth.
• 
Adapt the company’s capabilities to satisfy cus-
tomers’ current and future needs. At the same time 
that the CEO is seeking new customers, she must make 
sure that the company can satisfy their needs. To that 
end, the CEO must build out the company’s sales and 
marketing capabilities, expand its production and distri-
bution resources, build its regulatory staff to make sure 
the company can operate in new geographies, and bolster 
its service organization to assure that new customers 
remain satisfied with the company and are willing to buy 
more in the future. Boards should seek CEOs who can 
manage this process effectively to keep the company’s 
growth from stalling due to poor execution.
• 
As older products mature, invent and/or acquire 
new products to sustain the company’s growth. 
As we pointed out in Chapter 1, new products start off 
growing slowly, accelerate steeply, mature, and ultimately 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
193
decline. A company can only sustain industry-leading 
growth if it can sell new products—possibly obtained 
through a combination of internal development and 
acquisition—to take up the slack from the older ones 
that are declining. Of all the CEO skills needed to sustain 
a company’s industry-leading growth, this is perhaps the 
most difficult. Excessive dependence on acquisitions often 
creates the perception of success at the beginning—fol-
lowed by silent disappointment and a loss of industry-
leading growth.
Success: Alexion Pharmaceuticals Grows at 44% 
Annual Rate from Molecule to $4 Billion along Four 
Growth Vectors
Introduction
Alexion Pharmaceuticals makes drugs that cure rare, life-threatening dis-
eases—charging mind-bogglingly high prices for them. Yet despite the tiny 
number of people who buy its products and its high prices, Alexion has 
grown rapidly—at a 44% annual rate—between 1996 when it first started to 
generate revenues by providing contract research services and 2015. Over 
that 19-year stretch, Alexion’s growth trajectory chained together four key 
dimensions of growth:
• 
Customer group. For its first decade, from 1996 to 
2006, Alexion sold to drug researchers while it was 
advancing its first product through the process of regula-
tory review. Once it launched its first product, Alexion 
focused on two customer groups—the roughly 8,000 suf-
ferers of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) a 
fatal disease that destroys a person’s hemoglobin every 
day and the estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people afflicted 
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a dis-
ease that leads to disabling anemia, does not go away, and 
kills a third of patients within five years.
• 
Product. Alexion changed its product focus significantly 
between 1996 and 2016. Between 1996 and 2006, it pro-
vided contract research services to provide the company 
with cash flow until it could sell its first product—Soliris. 
Beginning in 2008, Alexion began acquiring companies 
that it believed had the potential to add to its marketable 
product line; and by 2015 it had added two new prod-
ucts—Strensiq and Kanuma.

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
194
• 
Capabilities. Alexion matched its capabilities to the 
requirements of competing in its different markets. Once 
it launched its first product in 2007, Alexion added to its 
staff of drug researchers—building a drug manufacturing 
facility in Rhode Island and enhancing its sales and mar-
keting departments to sell its products globally.
• 
Geography. Alexion provided contract research ser-
vices in the United States and once it began selling Soliris 
in 2007, the company marketed globally—generating 
sales both in the United States and in Europe—which 
between 2008 and 2015 was Alexion’s largest geographic 
market. In 2011, Alexion began selling in Asia/Pacific while 
it generated some additional revenue elsewhere—reach-
ing 50 countries by 2015.
Case Scenario
Alexion was founded in 1992 by a Yale Medical School professor and a friend. The 
company nearly ran out of money before its CEO decided as a last ditch effort to 
try to focus Alexion on a disease with a tiny number of sufferers. The professor in 
question was Leonard Bell—an attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital and 
an Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the Yale University 
School of Medicine who became Assistant Professor of Medicine and Pathology and 
Co-Director of the program in Vascular Biology at Yale Medical School before leaving 
in February 1992 to found and run Alexion.
Alexion was founded at a supermarket ice cream freezer and nearly ran out of 
money before Bell decided to stop resisting his scientists’ suggestion that he bet its 
remaining resources on curing a disease that affected fewer than 10,000 patients 
worldwide. Bell—who then had three children under the age of seven—was buying 
sweets at a supermarket when he bumped into a friend named Steve Squinto, a 
researcher at biotech Regeneron. Bell—whose father had built homes in New York—
told Squinto he wanted to start a company. By the end of the shopping trip, he had 
recruited Squinto to join him as its head of R&D.
Bell knew the area of microbiology on which he wanted Alexion to focus but it took 
six years before the company turned that scientific interest into a revenue-generating 
product. The science that interested Bell was a series of enzymes that destroy for-
eign substances in the body—called complement—and their corresponding comple-
ment blockers that keep this destruction under control. Bell and Squinto thought 
complement blockers might be turned into drugs to fight inflammation from arthritis 
to kidney problems. By 1995, Alexion discovered that complement blockers would 
not make good drugs because they only worked when attached to cell surfaces. 
Alexion was saved from oblivion by U.S. Surgical, which gave the company $5 million 
to make pig organs that could be inserted into people without being destroyed by 
complement thanks to a fragment of a complement-blocking monoclonal antibody 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
195
that Alexion would provide—aping the then-popular approach of Centocor, which 
had developed a successful treatment for post-heart-attack inflammation. On the 
strength of Centocor’s success, Alexion was able to raise $21 million in a 1996 IPO.
Sadly for Alexion investors, that monoclonal antibody fragment did not work against 
the most widespread diseases—sending the company careening toward another 
cash crisis. After evaluating 10,000 possibilities, Squinto’s R&D team found a mono-
clonal antibody that became Soliris. However, Soliris—which went into production 
in 1997—did not work as a cure for rheumatoid arthritis and kidney disease or 
post-heart-attack inflammation. Bell ultimately decided that Alexion should focus 
on PNH—a tiny market with no competition—designating Alexion scientist Russell 
Rother to work with Peter Hillmen—a UK-based global expert on PNH. Since com-
plement kills the red blood cells of PNH patients within two days—those cells live 
for four months in healthy people—the two scientists thought Soliris would work on 
PNH. While Bell thought the PNH market was too small, Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based Genzyme was able to generate $500 million in sales with its product to treat 
Gaucher, another rare disease. After a successful 2012 trial of Soliris on 11 patients, 
Bell worked with the FDA to design two trials of Soliris—the second one on 97 PNH 
patients helped everyone who got the drug. The drug was approved by the FDA in 
March 2007 and by 2016 sold for $440,000 a year per patient—a price usually 
paid for by insurance companies.
Once Alexion received approval to sell Soliris in the U.S. PNH market, its sales accel-
erated dramatically and its growth trajectory spanned three dimensions—geography,  
customer group, and capabilities. Between 1996 and 2006, its sales fluctuated from 
about $2 million to as high as $11 million in 2001 before drifting back under  
$2 million. But in 2007, its sales soared to $72 million and hit about $541 million 
by 2010 as it began to expand along two growth vectors—geography (in June 2007, 
the EC approved Soliris for PNH in Europe)—and customer group (in April 2009 the 
FDA approved Soliris for sale to U.S. aHUS patients and the EC granted the same 
approval for European aHUS patients in August 2009).
To satisfy the demand for its products, Alexion expanded its capabilities in manufactur-
ing and marketing. In July 2006, it acquired a manufacturing plant in Smithfield, Rhode 
Island; and in December 2009, the EC approved that facility for production of Soliris. 
By 2013, Alexion had established an organization to support sales of Soliris in the 
United States, in the major markets in European Union, Japan, Asia Pacific countries, 
and other territories. In the United States, Alexion’s customers were primarily specialty 
distributors and specialty pharmacies that supplied physician office clinics, hospital out-
patient clinics, infusion clinics, or home health care providers. Alexion also sold Soliris to 
government agencies. Outside the United States, its customers were primarily hospitals, 
hospital buying groups, pharmacies, other health care providers, and distributors.
Alexion realized that its potential for growth in these products was limited so it began 
to make acquisitions focused on rare diseases. As Bell said, “We focus on patients 
with absolutely devastating disorders that are also either lethal or life-threatening. 
They’re also very, very rare, so they get no attention from anybody. They’re left with 

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
196
no hope, and we only go forward not with treatments that will make it a little bit  
better but with treatments that will transform their lives. At the end of the day, every-
one accepts that is high-level innovation.” To that end, Alexion acquired products 
focused on such rare disease markets between 2011 and 2015 as its sales grew 
from $783 million to over $2.6 billion, including the following:
• 
Taligen. In January 2011, Alexion acquired this privately 
held development stage biotechnology company based in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose portfolio included novel 
antibody and protein regulators of the complement inflam-
matory pathways.
• 
Orphatec. In February 2011, Alexion acquired patents and 
assets from this company related to an investigational therapy 
for patients with an ultra-rare genetic disorder characterized 
by severe brain damage and rapid death in newborns—MoCD 
Type A.
• 
Enobia. In February 2012, Alexion acquired this privately 
held clinical-stage biotechnology company that was develop-
ing asfotase alfa, a human recombinant targeted alkaline 
phosphatase enzyme-replacement therapy for patients suf-
fering with an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic metabolic 
disease—hypophosphatasia (HPP).
In 2015, Alexion also added to its product portfolio when the FDA approved two of 
its drugs:
• 
Strensiq. In 2015, the FDA approved Strensiq for patients 
with perinatal-, infantile-, and juvenile-onset HPP; the EC 
granted marketing authorization for Strensiq for the treatment 
of patients with pediatric-onset HPP; and Japan’s Ministry of 
Health, Labor and Welfare approved Strensiq for the treat-
ment of patients with HPP.
• 
Kanuma, In 2015, the FDA approved Kanuma for the 
treatment of patients of all ages with Lysosomal acid lipase 
­deficiency (LALD)—a disease that causes children and adults 
to accumulate certain fats in the liver and spleen—and EC 
granted marketing authorization of Kanuma for long-term 
enzyme-replacement therapy in patients of all ages with LAL-D.
Bell retired as CEO in April 2015, leaving David Hallal in charge. Hallal had been 
Alexion’s CEO from September 2014 to April 2015 and in senior commercial posi-
tions, including senior vice president, U.S. Commercial Operations from June 2006 
until November 2008; senior vice president, Commercial Operations Americas from 
November 2008 to May 2010; senior vice president, Global Commercial Operations 
from May 2010 until October 2012; and then executive vice president and chief 
commercial officer from October 2012 to September 2014.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
197
By the third quarter of 2016, Hallal seemed to have been doing well sustaining 
Alexion’s growth after Bell’s retirement. For the nine months ending September 
2016, Alexion’s sales had increased 21% to $2.3 billion while its net income for the 
period increased 294% to $307 million. Ninety-one percent of Alexion’s revenues 
came from Soliris in the first nine months of 2016, about 6% came from Strensiq, 
and the remaining 3% from Kanuma. Sadly for Alexion, Hallal could not hold into 
his job as CEO. Due to accounting problems, in December 2016 Hallal was out as 
CEO as was CFO Vikas Sinha because “senior management pressured staff to get 
customers to order [Soliris] earlier than needed to meet financial targets.” Would 
Alexion’s board appoint a new CEO who could restore its rapid growth?1
Case Analysis
Bell followed the four principles for constructing an effective large company 
growth trajectory:
• 
Match a value-creating product to specific cus-
tomer group’s unmet need. Alexion’s decision to 
focus its technology on orphan diseases was an excel-
lent example of finding an unmet need and delivering a 
uniquely effective solution—thus yielding a very high will-
ingness to pay, which spurred its initial growth spurt.
• 
Sell that product to new geographies and/or to 
new customer groups. Alexion sold Soliris globally 
and was able to provide it to patients with different dis-
eases in order to sustain its initial growth.
• 
Adapt the company’s capabilities to satisfy cus-
tomers’ current and future needs. Alexion expanded 
its manufacturing and marketing presence globally to sup-
port the growing global demand for its products.
• 
As older products mature, invent and/or acquire 
new products to sustain the company’s growth. 
Alexion acquired technologies targeted at orphan diseases 
and developed its own new products. By the time Bell 
retired, his successor was beginning to generate revenues 
from the new products in an effort to keep Alexion growing.

Unsuccessful: Yahoo Grows Then Shrinks—Selling 
Out to Verizon for $4.8 Billion
Introduction
As the Alexion case demonstrates, to sustain rapid growth a large company’s 
board must choose a CEO with the right mindset. And it stands to reason 
that a board that installs the wrong CEOs could find itself overseeing mis-
guided investments that squander corporate resources without generating 
industry-leading growth. With the possible exception of Tim Koogle, the for-
mer Motorola executive who ran Yahoo from 1995 to 2001—leading its 1996 
IPO at $13 a share followed by a huge stock price run-up before the dot-com 
crash, Yahoo’s CEOs did not craft effective growth trajectories. 
Yahoo’s early CEOs built effective growth trajectories—but later ones fell 
short. Things started off well—during Koogle’s tenure, Yahoo revenue soared 
from $2 million to $1.1 billion and its stock spiked over 1,300% until January 
2000 when it began a 38% plunge from its IPO price in March 2001 when he 
left. Following Koogle, Terry Semel, a former Warner Brothers executive took 
over—overseeing a nice run-up in revenue from about $717 million to nearly  
$7 billion—acquired a big stake in Alibaba before it went public and declined 
a chance to invest in Google. From there, a string of executives presided over 
a steady ­revenue decline from $7.2 billion in 2008 to about $4.9 billion in 
2015 after interference from activist investors. In 2016, Verizon agreed to pay 
about $4.8 ­billion for Yahoo’s web assets—over $40 billion less than Microsoft 
offered in 2008.
Yahoo peaked out in the first Internet wave but hung on long after it had 
ceded leadership to Google and others. As the Web went mainstream in the 
2000s, Yahoo could not keep up. Google used its algorithm-based web-query 
approach paired with keyword search advertising to take the lead. In 2005, 
Google’s revenue surpassed Yahoo’s. But Yahoo survived another decade. 
According to Paul Saffo, who teaches forecasting at Stanford, “It lasted a whole 
hell of a lot longer than I thought it would. It made some right moves, but it 
could never get ahead of the curve.”
Case Scenario
Yahoo’s less than stellar growth trajectory can be traced to the history of its leader-
ship that was too often ineffective at foreseeing the evolution of its industry and 
crafting a vision that would enable Yahoo to capture the growth from these evolving 
trends. Instead, its CEOs made a string of acquisitions and investments—most of 
which did not pay off—even as it bungled what turned out to be the best invest-
ment opportunities. After its cofounders, Yahoo lacked top leadership with the ability 
to develop new services that consumers and advertisers found compelling—so its 
CEOs acquired other companies hoping that they would close the growth gap.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
199
Yahoo was founded by graduate students at the Stanford School of Engineering. 
In 1994, Jerry Yang, a Taiwanese math genius; and David Filo, a programmer from 
Louisiana, created a directory of links called Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide 
Web—web surfers embraced their map to what at the time was a difficult-to-navigate 
digital landscape. In 1995, Sequoia Capital invested in Yahoo and put Koogle—who 
presided over 16 acquisitions in the first five years of his tenure—in the CEO slot. Filo 
stayed on as technical leader—writing the first version of Yahoo’s search engine while 
Yang was involved in strategic decision such as replacing Koogle with Semel.
Semel was a media executive who brought other media executives to Yahoo—thus 
creating the enduring identity struggle within Yahoo—was it a media or technology 
company? Semel lacked the strategic skill to see where market opportunity would 
reside and how to capture it. While Google was inventing a text advertising business 
that augmented web search results, Yahoo’s persisted with its increasingly annoying 
banner ads. Semel passed on acquiring Google in 2002 and could have acquired 
Facebook in 2006 if he had not lowered his offer from $1 billion to $850 million 
after a disappointing earnings report.
Yang took over as CEO from Semel in 2007 and turned down what in retrospect 
was Yahoo’s best exit offer—a $45 billion bid in 2008 from Microsoft that then-CEO 
Steve Ballmer believed would help it compete with Google. After Yang came a string 
of hapless CEOs—ex-Autodesk CEO, Carol Bartz and former president of PayPal; 
and Scott Thompson—who was fired after four months for faking a degree on his 
resume. Finally Marissa Mayer—hailed as someone who could reinvent Yahoo’s 
­services—took over in 2012—spending $2.8 billion on 53 acquisitions, including 
social-blogging platform Tumblr ($1.1 billion that was expected to contribute a mere 
$25 million in 2016 operating income on $80 million in revenue) and video-ad-tech 
company Brightroll ($650 million). Yahoo also invested in original-video program-
ming like the Community series, which it wrote off in 2015. Once merged with Yahoo, 
these services did not become popular enough to stop Yahoo’s revenue slide.
Mayer believed strongly that she should be the ultimate arbiter of Yahoo’s product—
thus stifling the creativity of her staff. A former Yahoo senior manager said, “Marissa 
is one of those people who’s always certain she’s right. She would undermine us, 
change her mind, or make everything go through her at the end of the day. It was a 
nightmare.” Another employee said, “There’s a uniform, recurring theme of bureau-
cracy in too many layers. Nobody was ever fully empowered.” And in an interview 
with Charlie Rose, she refused to admit failure—a trait that inhibited Yahoo’s ability 
to learn. As she told Rose when asked about Yahoo’s mergers, “I actually think they 
did work. I think that it really was a matter of; we needed to rebuild some of the 
talent base. Obviously, we have fallen slightly behind where we hoped to be in terms 
of our plans, but I’m still very optimistic about Tumblr.”
Ultimately she acceded to the demands of activist investors and sold off various 
pieces—leaving the rest for Verizon—although by January 2017 it was unclear 
whether a massive data breach at Yahoo might unwind the deal. In July 2016, 
Verizon Communications agreed to buy Yahoo! Inc.’s web assets—that attracted a 
billion monthly users to its mail, news and sports content and financial tools—for 

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
200
$4.83 billion—leaving Yahoo with its stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo 
Japan Corp.—then worth about $40 billion in combined market value.
Case Analysis
The Yahoo case study illustrates three principles that large company boards 
should avoid when mapping a growth trajectory:
• 
Install CEOs without product vision. With the 
exception of Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s board consistently 
installed CEOs whose background was outside the Web 
search and advertising industry. As a result, each of the 
CEOs was unable to envision the direction of technology, 
competitor strategies, and evolving customer needs to 
create a new vision for Yahoo’s service that would keep 
it ahead of rivals. While Yahoo’s board hoped that her 
Google experience would ignite product innovation, she 
did not meet expectations.
• 
Acquire companies that fail the four tests of a 
successful acquisition. Yahoo made many acquisitions 
over its 21-year history. However, those deals did not add 
enough revenue or profit to offset their purchase price. 
To be sure, the stock market value of Yahoo’s Alibaba and 
Yahoo! Japan stakes show that some of its deals were 
successful. This suggests that the strategic rationale 
for most of the deals was fairly flimsy—it appears that 
Yahoo’s CEOs did not apply the four tests of a successful 
acquisition that we discussed in Chapter 4.
• 
Create a culture that stifles employee creativity 
and initiative. Yahoo suffered from cultural problems. 
For example, the 2006 Peanut Butter Manifesto highlighted 
the way Yahoo under Semel spread resources evenly 
across all its product lines without regard to their different 
levels of profit potential. As a result, employees concluded 
that management did not care about winning—rewarding 
unproductive employees for their long tenure and scrimp-
ing on pay for excellent performance. And when Mayer 
became CEO in 2012, her insistence on controlling all 
product decisions demoralized staff and repelled talent.

■Principle Two  Small companies grow from start-up to public company by expanding initial 
product success within a customer group to new geographies.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
201
To achieve a successful exit for investors, a small company’s growth trajectory 
depends heavily on finding a group of customers willing to buy its product—
followed by an urgent effort to expand into new geographies in which the 
product will find significant demand. More specifically, a common benchmark 
for a small company seeking an initial public offering is to achieve $100 million 
in revenues and annual growth exceeding 30%. To build a growth trajectory to 
reach those targets a small company should follow four principles:
• 
Appoint a CEO with product vision and execution 
skills. A start-up’s odds of achieving success grow sig-
nificantly if its CEO has the right skills. As we have seen 
in many cases in this book, among the most important 
of these skills are the abilities to envision a product that 
customers will want to buy and to build a team that turns 
that vision efficiently into a tangible product.
• 
Find a large market opportunity with significant 
customer pain. To turn such a product into a business, 
the CEO must codevelop it with customers who have a 
significant unmet need that other vendors are not satisfy-
ing. As we saw in the Alexion case, in rare cases a small 
number of potential customers can turn into a large mar-
ket if the price for the product is sufficiently high. However, 
Alexion is the exception that proves a more common 
rule—CEOs should seek to develop products that will 
solve a large unmet need shared by a large numbers of 
potential customers. Often CEOs become aware of these 
opportunities because they formerly worked for large 
companies that are creating them by providing ­customers 
with over-priced, inflexible products that contribute heav-
ily to the large company’s growth and profitability.
• 
Build a product that delivers an irresistible jump in 
value to customers. Start-ups generally do not survive 
very long because most of them run out of cash before 
they start to generate enough revenue to be acquired 
or go public. Sometimes, start-ups get large quickly but 
competitors witness that success and introduce a better 
product that takes away the start-up’s customers. This 
makes potential customers reluctant to buy a start-up’s 
product because the company may go out of business 
and not be able to support the product. To overcome 
such hesitancy, a start-up must offer customers an irre-
sistible jump in value (what I call a Quantum Value Leap 
(QVL))—the ratio between the product’s benefits and its 
price—relative to competing products.

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
202
• 
Expand quickly into new geographies with strong 
demand for that product. If a company enjoys 
rapid growth selling its product to a specific customer 
group in its home geography, it should expand into new 
­geographies with similar customer groups that are simi-
larly eager to buy that product. Although the start-up 
should understand the CAGE differences between its 
home country and the new geography, this geographic 
­expansion strategy may enable the company to grow 
quickly without making significant changes to its product 
or marketing strategy.
Successful: Nutanix Grows at 140% Annual Rate to 
Go Public Seven Years after Launch
Introduction
Nutanix, a San Jose, California-based HCI supplier, was founded in September 
2009 and started selling its first product in October 2011—five years later it 
went public. HCI offered companies a QVL, because this product category—
in which Nutanix led the industry—combined up to 12 different corporate 
data processing functions such as server, virtualization, and storage—into a 
single device running on an inexpensive piece of computer hardware run by 
sophisticated software. By July 2016, this strategy won Nutanix 3,768 end 
customers supported by 1,980 employees generating $445 million in revenues 
(with a net loss of $168 million)—up at a four-year annual growth rate of 187%.
Case Scenario
Nutanix grew rapidly because compared to rivals such as EMC, NetApp, and VMWare, 
Nutanix’s product saved customers money and helped them adapt to change. Not 
only did Nutanix’s products reduce companies purchase costs by 20% cost and oper-
ating cost by another 50% it, but it also boosted the customer’s ability to adapt to 
change in its business. As a result, Nutanix said it was taking customers from EMC. 
In November 2014, Nutanix senior vice president of Product and Marketing, Howard 
Ting, told me “Nutanix beats EMC in many large enterprise accounts. We recently 
won the business of a major biotechnology company that previously bought from 
EMC. The company wanted to reduce its IT headcount 15% and get more agile while 
lowering costs. We saved the company 15% to 20% over EMC in capital expendi-
tures and 40% to 50% on operating expenditures.” Ting also believed that Nutanix 
helped customers in more qualitative ways. ”We make them more nimble—it takes 
15 minutes to install our product to 14 days for VBlock and enable them to add stor-
age capacity in smaller increments—rather than the three year increments that EMC 
requires them to buy. We are in the second inning of this game,” said Ting.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
203
Nutanix believed that it was targeting a huge market that was growing rapidly. As 
Ting said, “IDC estimates that the market for converged infrastructure is $15 billion 
and it grew 60% in the last quarter. We save big companies tens of millions of 
dollars in total cost of ownership (a national mortgage bank lowered its capital 
expenditures 43% and its total cost of ownership 62% over five years compared to 
VBlock—a converged product sold through VCE, an EMC/Cisco joint venture.)”
One of Nutanix’s cofounders was a serial entrepreneur who appeared to love 
starting new businesses but not sticking around until they either got acquired or 
went public. Mohit Aron—founder and long-departed chief technology officer of 
Nutanix—owned 10.7 million shares of its common stock, which represented 8.7% 
of its Class B shares. That meant he had many reasons for hoping that Nutanix 
went public and did well thereafter. But Aron was not concerned about money. As he 
explained in a September 14, 2016, interview, “The IPO is a funding event. Money is 
not why I do things. For me it’s about passion.”
And perhaps that explains why he left Nutanix in January 2013 to start Cohesity. 
As he said, “We started Nutanix because when I got my PhD from Rice University 
I talked with the founder of NetApp who told me that storage was most efficient if 
it was managed as a network. But that never made sense to me; I thought storage 
would work better if it was local. And that’s what Nutanix does for primary storage.”
In September 2016, Aron told me that Nutanix had the potential to make money 
because it and its competitors were adapting to a change in the venture capital 
climate. As he said, “A few years ago, venture capital firms were investing in hyper-
convergence companies and were willing to subsidize their price cuts so they could 
gain market share and accelerate revenue growth.” The appetite for fast growth 
and cash immolation has cooled.” Public market investors punished companies like 
Pure Storage that were losing money and venture capitalists changed their perspec-
tive—urging their portfolio companies to cut costs to become profitable. They are 
not cutting prices the way they used to,” said Aron.
Meanwhile CEO Dheeraj Pandey had created a culture at Nutanix that blended humil-
ity in the face of its customers with bravado toward rivals. As Pandey explained in a 
December 2014 interview, caring about employees, customers, and partners was the 
key to the company’s success. Said Pandey, “Empathy for individuals can lead to great 
things. First is employees. They are fully in the company, they signed on. Second is 
customers—they signed on as well. Third is partners who can benefit from network 
effects. Pandey believes it is more important to do what brings you joy than to pursue 
riches. As he said, “We look at them not as portfolios to try to make us rich—but as 
individuals. This drives us to feel compassion and to listen to what they are actually say-
ing to us. Even when we become a public company, Wall Street will be a side effect.”
Pandey took a different view of the competition. As he said, giving before taking is 
critical to competitive success. “In the 1990s, companies were scrambling to build 
an infrastructure to take advantage of the Internet. Companies that could supply it 
were in a strong bargaining position to squeeze customers. But now there are 50 
competitors and we believe we must be humble, have empathy for customers, and 

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
204
give to them before we can expect to get,” argued Pandey. There was a kind of 
schizophrenia at Nutanix. “We are humble in the presence of our customers and 
aggressive with the competition,” Pandey explained.
Nutanix also wanted to create a sense of camaraderie among its employees. 
According to Pandey, “We use Yammer as a way to keep our organization flat. We 
operate in 28 or 29 countries and our people can communicate with others at 
almost any time of day. Even though they don’t see each other in person, they feel 
close.” Nutanix also offers great employee benefits. It pays 100% of an employee’s 
health costs; 100% of any dependents; and $10,000 per family reimbursement of 
unexpected medical costs.
With customers, Nutanix wanted long-term, repeat business rather than a focus 
on massive multimillion dollar deals. And the company also had empathy for how 
the partners did business and make money so it did not squeeze them too much 
on margin. Nutanix believed that the most iconic brands offered experiences rather 
than products. “The biggest brands sell an experience (right brain) rather than a 
thing (left brain). Brands like Williams Sonoma, Amazon, and Apple manage the 
customer’s experience. We try to do that by, for example, making sure that custom-
ers do not have to go very long before they get the right answer to their questions,” 
Pandey said, “Ultimately, the necessary and sufficient condition to build a large busi-
ness is to use empathy to fully realize an excellent customer experience.”
Nine months after filing for its initial public offering, Nutanix finally went public—in a 
very successful first day of trading that sent its shares above the offering price. A few 
days later, Nutanix stock peaked at about $47 a share but by November 15, they 
had lost 31% of their value. Would Nutanix be able to keep growing and ultimately 
achieve profitability?
Case Analysis
Nutanix illustrates five principles that can help small companies build effective 
growth trajectories:
• 
Appoint a leadership team with product vision and 
sales and other key capabilities. Nutanix’s ­former 
CTO and its current CEO combined in two ­people the 
capabilities needed to start and sustain its rapid growth. 
While Aron was a product visionary and talented ­engineer, 
he lost patience with building an organization to support 
Nutanix’s sustained growth. Here Pandey excelled at 
attracting and motivating talent, building up a global cus-
tomer base, and raising capital.
• 
Find a large market opportunity with significant 
customer pain. HCI targets a huge market—Nutanix 
estimated it as a $15 billion opportunity. While that fig-
ure may exaggerate the sales potential for HCI, growth 

Disciplined Growth Strategies
205
over the last several years has been very rapid—which 
suggests that many early-adopters of this technology 
experienced significant pain from incumbent products 
due to their very high cost to purchase and operate as 
well as their inflexibility to customers’ evolving business 
requirements.
• 
Build a product that delivers an irresistible jump 
in value to customers. Nutanix’s growth is largely a 
result of the QVL it provides customers. As Nutanix said, 
one customer cut its capital expenditures 15% to 20% 
when swapping out technology from EMC, cut operat-
ing expenditures 40% to 50%, and accelerated installation 
times from 14 days to 15 minutes while being able to add 
much smaller capacity increments to support growth.
• 
Create a culture of growth. Thanks to Pandey, 
Nutanix’s culture motivated people to act in ways that 
helped it to attract and motivate talented people, to pro-
vide great service to customers, to collaborate well with 
partners, and to compete fiercely with rivals. These values 
helped Nutanix to sustain its industry-leading growth rate.
• 
Expand quickly into new geographies with strong 
demand for that product. Nutanix expanded its ini-
tial product from the United States to the rest of the 
world—and in the years from 2012 to 2016, about 60% 
of its revenues came from the United States while a bit 
under 40% were from the rest of the world. This global 
expansion helped Nutanix to scale to the point at which 
it could go public.
Unsuccessful: Fiksu Revenues Spike to $100 Million 
in 3.5 Years, and Then Implode
Introduction
An MIT math major earned a PhD in theoretical computer science at the 
University of California, Berkeley, and got tenure as a professor at the 
University of Massachusetts. He went on sabbatical—and started three com-
panies. In 2010, he started app marketer Fiksu—it means smart in Finnish—
which raised $17.6 million in venture capital and grew to $100 million in 
revenue in 3.5 years targeting a $19 billion revenue opportunity that was 
growing at over 60% a year. Then its revenues fell, and by 2015 it had scrapped 
plans for an IPO and dismissed 10% of its workforce. In June 2016, Fiksu sold 
itself for an undisclosed price to an obscure marketing agency.

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories
206
Case Scenario
Between 1986 and 2005, Micah Adler, Fiksu’s founder and CEO, proved his excellence 
as a student and professor—and by 2012 he had demonstrated what appeared 
to be exceptional courage by chucking his academic career to start five companies. 
In May 2005, Adler was a tenured associate professor in the Computer Science 
department at UMass Amherst. He had a sabbatical coming up and originally had 
planned to “travel around the world, visiting various computer science departments, 
working with world class collaborators who lived in interesting places. Then, [he] 
unexpectedly came up with an idea for a business and decided to cancel the travel 
plans and use [his] sabbatical to start CourseAdvisor—[a Wakefield, Massachusetts-
based online lead generator serving the education industry he cofounded in 2004 
that the Washington Post bought in October 2007]. Five companies later, he [saw 
that being an entrepreneur was] an incredibly fun and rewarding way of life, where 
every single day brings interesting challenges,” Adler explained.
Fiksu was founded to solve a business problem that Adler faced when he developed 
apps. Given the relative ease of building apps and making them available for sale on 
platforms such as Apple’s iTunes store, app developers needed a way to stand out 
from the pack and encourage people to download their apps so they could get paid 
for their efforts. Fiksu was originally named Fluent Mobile—launching a news reader 
in July 2009. But Adler struggled to market Fluent Mobile’s apps. As he said, “We were 
building our own news reader and we had a very positive launch. It was app of the 
week. It was written about in the New York Times. We were seeing 50,000 down-
loads a day, but things dried out very quickly.” Adler tinkered with ways of getting users 
to download its apps—ultimately slashing its cost per download from $3 to about  
26 cents. By July 2011 Fiksu was operating a platform—used by Groupon, Gilt Groupe, 
and numerous game developers—that helped app developers find the least expensive 
way—from among 20 mobile advertising networks and incentivized install companies 
such as FreeMyApps that gives users free gift cards for playing games—to achieve 
client-defined outcomes such as getting users to buy or open their app three times.
Adler saw in Fiksu a way to tap a huge market that he could serve with his passion 
for and skill at building algorithms. As Adler told me, “I did some analysis and reached 
a conclusion that many people saw as shocking—there would be $100 billion worth 
of acquisitions of mobile companies. One thing that helped me reach this conclusion 
is that Google estimated that mobile ads would reach 30% of its traffic. I decided that 
I needed to get in and build something and we would learn as we go. We started 
to develop algorithms to make digital marketing efficient. We reached out to AdMob 
(acquired by Google), Quattro (bought by Apple), and Millennial Media—which went 
public. I brought in some PhDs to figure out how to get more efficient. [After lowering 
the cost per download to 26 cents], we realized that we had invented something that 
was powerful, unique, and with broad commercial appeal. We surged to the number 
one position in the news category on the app store because our algorithm has better

207
targeting—get the right ad to the right person at the right time; reach—[in August 
2013 Fiksu aggregated] across over 200 mobile ad networks, and efficiency—making 
decisions that must be made 50,000 times per second in under 100 milliseconds each.”
Fiksu grew quickly. In April 2011, it had 23 employees and by August 2013, it 
employed “between 190 and 200. 150 in Boston and the others in London, Helsinki, 
Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore and San Francisco” serving 500 customers such as Coke, 
Disney, eBay, and Groupon. By August 2014, Fiksu was up to $100 million in revenue, 
expecting to end 2014 with 300 employees, more than 800 customers, “promoting 
more than 2,300 mobile apps with profiles of nearly 60% of the world’s smart-
phones and tablets, three billion app downloads, and 3.5 trillion marketing events.”
It looked like Fiksu was poised for a 2015 IPO, but hopes for that were definitively 
crushed by June 2016. In 2015, it hired a chief financial officer who had helped 
take another company public but fired him in March 2015—dismissing 10% of 
its workforce or 26 people. Around September 2015, Fiksu dismissed another 25 
employees and closed some international offices—leaving it with 115 employees by 
June 2016. That’s when Fiksu was gobbled up for undisclosed terms by ClickDealer, 
a Menlo Park, California-based marketing agency part of an international asset 
management firm called Noosphere. Adler said of the deal, “As experts in trans-
forming high-potential companies into definitive market leaders—with a diverse set 
of advertising technology businesses in their portfolio—Noosphere not only saw an 
incredible opportunity in Fiksu but also noted the remarkable synergy of our teams.”
Fiksu’s collapse can be attributed to two changes in the industry. In 2014, Apple 
began to crack down on incentivized installs—in fact, game developers were paying 
Fiksu but were working hard not to disclose the fact. Christian Calderon, chief rev-
enue officer of game studio Ketchapp said, “It was totally common for user acquisi-
tion (UA) managers to straight-up lie about using it. I even heard of one UA manager 
that got a note from Fiksu’s accounting team asking them to confirm that they were 
a client and the manager ignored the message because they didn’t want a paper 
trail. It was always tricky for Fiksu because . . . the quality of that kind of traffic is not 
good. It was a critical part of Fiksu’s growth, but it ended up being a bad business to 
be in because Apple looks down on it.”
While incentivized installs have not disappeared, there is fierce rivalry over the 
remaining spoils. As Adler said, “Like many startups, Fiksu has not been immune to 
competitive pressures—this is a highly competitive market”—noting that 85 cents 
of every new dollar spent in online advertising went to either Facebook or Google 
in Q1 2016, according to Morgan Stanley. In 2013, Fiksu took a $5 million line of 
credit from Bridge Bank and in 2014 it added $10 million in debt financing from 
Silicon Valley Bank. As business slowed, Fiksu may have lacked sufficient cash to both 
operate the company and pay off its loans. Indeed, that may have triggered a loan 
contract term that enabled Bridge Bank to take ownership of Fiksu—which then 
sold it to Noosphere.

Chapter 7 | Growth Trajectories

Case Analysis
Fiksu was exceptionally successful before it imploded. Its disappointing 
­outcome suggests that Adler failed to follow three principles that small 
­companies should use to construct effective growth trajectories:
• 
Target a customer group that uniquely values 
your product. Fiksu’s rapid growth demonstrates 
that its customers found its product valuable. However, 
Fiksu’s product was too easy for rivals to copy and too 
dependent on the bargaining power of a large partner, 
Apple. Fiksu targeted a customer group that valued its 
product—but that value was not unique enough to keep 
customers from switching to rivals’ products. Fiksu might 
have done better had it found a customer group that 
uniquely valued its product.
• 
Develop new products to stay ahead of compet-
ing products targeting that customer group. It 
is unclear whether Adler was aware of how quickly its 
product was transitioning from rapid growth to decline. 
However, Fiksu was clearly unable to introduce a new 
product that could surf a new growth curve when revenue 
from its previous products began to decline. To sustain 
its growth, Fiksu should have introduced new products to 
take up the slack from the decline in its original products.
• 
Create a growth culture that supports sustain-
able customer value. Fiksu was too dependent on a 
product that its customers were embarrassed to admit 
they bought. This does not mean necessarily that Fiksu 
tolerated unethical conduct—however, it does suggest 
that it did not place enough value of building products 
that customers would be proud to recommend to other 
people. As a result, when Apple began to frown on incen-
tivized installs, Fiksu’s customers fled. Fiksu should have 
held itself to a higher standard of creating products that 
delivered sustainable customer value.
Applying the Principles of Effective Growth 
Trajectories
Leaders seeking to construct sustainable growth trajectories should consider 
five questions:
• 
Does my product offer so much value to a group of cus-
tomers that they will choose it over competing products 
and recommend it enthusiastically to others?

Disciplined Growth Strategies
209
• 
Is the market opportunity among this customer group 
large enough that the company can grow rapidly by 
expanding into new geographies with minimal CAGE dis-
tance from our home geography?
• 
Do we have the right capabilities to sustain rapid growth 
as we introduce new products or do we need to acquire 
a company to obtain them?
• 
Does our company have a deep bench of leaders with the 
blend of product vision and execution skills needed to 
sustain rapid growth?
• 
Does our company have a culture that listens with an 
open mind to customers, respects and motivates our 
employees, and aggressively competes with rivals?
Chapter 8: Growth Road Maps provides a detailed methodology for applying 
the principles of growth through new products.
Summary
To sustain growth over time, companies must construct effective growth tra-
jectories. Whether large company or small, such trajectories match a new 
product with a customer group that is eager to buy because it satisfies an 
unmet need better than rival products. Once established, continued growth 
comes from selling the same product to similar customers in new geographies. 
Next, a company should seek growth from targeting the original product to 
new customer groups—or if that is not fruitful—to consider new products—
whether developed internally or acquired—that a company’s current custom-
ers will eagerly purchase. And as the company expands in these ways, it may 
also need to add new capabilities to sustain its rapid growth. Underlying this 
ever-adapting growth trajectory, a company seeking to sustain rapid growth 
must foster a growth culture that listens with an open mind to customers, 
respects and motivates employees, and spurs bold competitive moves to 
counter rivals.

Chapter 2. Road Map for Growing Faster via 
Customers
A company aspiring to grow faster from current or new customer groups 
ought to assess its CEO before embarking on a new growth strategy. A com-
pany’s independent board members ought to assess the CEO’s fitness to 
boost the company’s growth. To be sure, the CEO characteristics needed to 
lead a company to faster growth are likely to vary depending on the specific 
company, its industry, its performance, and its prospects. In general, there are 
six traits that may indicate to boards that the current CEO will be able to 
achieve faster growth:
• 
Prior experience conceiving and executing successful 
growth strategies
• 
Skill at leading diverse teams in a collaborative, rather 
than dictatorial, fashion
• 
Ability to attract and motivate strong functional 
­executives—for example, vice presidents of engineering, 
manufacturing, sales, and service

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
212
• 
Intellectual humility and willingness to engage in fact-
based intellectual debate
• 
Resistance to assuming that past sources of success will 
lead to future success
• 
Recognition of the importance of winning by creating 
superior value for potential customers
Conversely, if the current CEO demonstrates the opposite of these traits, it 
that may indicate that a new person should take over:
• 
No prior experience conceiving and executing successful 
growth strategies
• 
Command and control style of management that shuts 
down team contributions
• 
Inability to attract and retain strong functional executives
• 
Tendency to listen only to information that confirms 
what the CEO already believes
• 
Desire to prove that strategies that worked in the past 
will work for different situations
• 
Belief that the CEO knows more than customers or 
competitors about where to find growth
The case studies we examined in this chapter suggest that a board would 
have judged the CEOs of McDonalds, Criteo, SoFi, and Actifio as possess-
ing desirable traits for conceiving and executing an effective growth strat-
egy. Easterbrook clearly had a helpful combination of experience inside and 
outside McDonalds. His inside experience helped him to understand how 
to persuade key stakeholders such as franchisees and employees to accept 
a change in strategy and his outside experience made him more open to 
listening to customers and observing competitor strategies. Rudelle clearly 
had the intellectual humility needed to listen to customers, observe their 
unmet needs, and lead his organization to develop and sell a new product that 
met the needs of its customers. And Ashutosh’s broad technology industry 
experience and prior success at building Actifio’s market position among large 
organizations made it more likely that he would be able to build a new service 
for a new customer segment. Similarly, Cagney’s success getting SoFi into a 
leading position in student loan refinancing would suggest to the board that 
he might be able to sell more to customers in its installed base. By contrast, a 
board would be in a difficult position trying to decide whether DeLuca, Perez, 
or Nguyen would be good candidates to lead a growth strategy. DeLuca cre-
ated Subway but by the time of the case had lost his creative edge. Perez was 
brought in from HP with the idea that he would build a profitable position 
in ink cartridges for Kodak as he had done with inkjet printers. And Nguyen

picked investors who would be easily overpowered by his persuasive skills—
despite his lack of success building sustainable companies.
If a company’s current CEO is well-suited to the challenges of creating and 
executing an effective growth strategy, he or she should lead a three phased 
process:
• 
Diagnose current growth strategy
• 
Envision future growth strategy
• 
Execute growth strategy
I. Diagnose Growth Strategy
The CEO ought to begin creating a growth strategy via current or new cus-
tomers by using the Five Dimensions of Growth framework described in 
Chapter 1 to diagnose the company’s current strategy. This is an important 
place to start because it will help the company to assess its current resources 
and to evaluate the resources it needs to add before it can achieve its growth 
goals. To the end, the CEO ought to do the following:
• 
Assemble a team of people—leaders of business units or 
key functional divisions—within the company who will 
ultimately be in charge of achieving faster growth.
• 
Consider seeking outside assistance from an expert who 
can help collect and analyze data in an objective manner.
• 
Develop a detailed description of the company’s current 
growth strategy with respect to customers. To that end, 
the strategy team should gather data to answer the fol-
lowing questions:
• 
Which 20% of the company’s customers account for 
80% of its revenue?
• 
Are these key customers organizations or 
individuals?
• 
If the key customers are organizations, do 
they share common characteristics—such as 
industries, size (e.g., number of employees), or 
attitude toward new technologies (e.g., early- or 
late-adopters)?
• 
If the key customers are individuals, do they 
share common characteristics such as age range, 
education level, income, or attitude toward new 
technologies?

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
214
• 
Based on these common characteristics, what 
customer groups are contributing most to the 
company’s current revenues?
• 
Who are the company’s competitors and what are 
their shares of the segment?
• 
In which segments does the company lead?
• 
How fast are these segments growing and what 
factors are driving that growth
• 
Why is the company leading in those segments and 
how sustainable is that lead?
• 
In which segments is the company lagging?
• 
How fast are these segments growing and what 
factors are driving that growth?
• 
Why is the company lagging in those segments 
and how difficult would it be for the company to 
improve its competitive position?
Actifio addressed many of these questions when it decided to focus on a new 
group of customers—SMEs. Ashutosh decided that his company’s dependence 
on well-known large companies as customers had considerable marketing 
value. But he was concerned that the unpredictability of their cash flows put 
too much stress on the organization at the end of the quarter when he faced 
considerable pressure to meet sales targets and customers did not feel the 
same sense of urgency about signing contracts with Actifio. The cumulative 
effect of the uncertainty of how long it would take to close sales with large 
organizations led Ashutosh to the conclusion that he should start to seek 
revenues from the $580 billion market for IT spending by SMEs.
II. Envision Growth Strategy
Once the strategy team has answered these questions, the CEO should lead a 
process for envisioning a growth strategy from current or new customers. To 
that end, the team should brainstorm, evaluate, and choose a growth strategy 
from among many creative options through the following steps.
• 
Brainstorm many possible growth vectors among current 
or new customers. The team should base these ideas on 
four principles:
• 
Listen to customers in segments where the 
company is winning and losing—discussing customer 
pain points and unmet needs

Disciplined Growth Strategies
215
• 
Study fast-growing rivals and identify which 
customer groups are contributing most to their 
rapid growth
• 
Seek deeper understanding of the trends underlying 
customer pain and rivals’ rapid growth
• 
Encourage participants not to self-censor and to 
generate both blend blue sky and more-grounded 
ideas
• 
Rank the growth vectors based on criteria such as these:
• 
The size, growth, and profitability of the market 
segments
• 
The company’s current or potential competitive 
advantage
• 
The net present value of the investment required to 
implement the strategy
• 
Scrutinize the best ideas by conducting more in-depth 
analysis such as customer interviews, cost analysis, and 
competitor analysis.
• 
Articulate the two best ideas emerging from this process 
in clear and specific terms. The growth strategies should 
answer questions such as the following:
• 
In which customers’ segments will the company 
compete?
• 
What are the company’s market share targets by 
year in those segments?
• 
What products or services will the company offer 
those customers?
• 
Why does the company believe that customers will 
prefer its products over competitors’?
• 
Will the company sell the product via direct sales, 
distributors, or other means?
• 
How much capital will be required to implement the 
strategy?
• 
What does the company estimate will be the net 
present value of that investment?

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
216
Actifio’s SME strategy suggests that it followed some of these steps—but not 
others. For example, Actifio seems to have developed a product for the SME 
market that would save customers money and enable their IT systems to be 
more responsive to customer needs. However, Actifio did not think enough 
ahead of time about the capabilities required to succeed in the SME market. It 
became clear within several months that Actifio would either need to invest 
in many new capabilities or change its strategy to one that better aligned with 
its strengths.
III. Execute Growth Strategy
Having assessed the company’s current growth strategy and envisioning a 
future strategy, the final step is to execute that strategy so that the company 
can achieve the desired results. To do this, the CEO will need to transform 
both the strategy and organization to achieve faster growth premised on the 
idea that people who excelled in the old organization may find themselves out 
of a job and new people will come into the company. To that end, the CEO 
should do this:
• 
Persuade the board to dedicate the resources—such 
as capital and people—to making the growth strategy 
successful
• 
Communicate the growth vision clearly to the entire 
organization
• 
Identify employees who embrace the vision and those 
who seek to resist it
• 
Make any job cuts completely at once and with a ­minimum 
of delay
• 
Bring in new hires quickly and give them clear goals and 
the resources needed to achieve those goals
• 
Listen carefully to concerns and over-communicate 
­progress in implementing the strategy
• 
Measure progress toward growth goals and adjust the 
strategy to overcome obstacles
In executing its SME strategy, Actifio did measure progress toward its goal and 
realized that it needed a significant change in its approach. Sadly for Actifio’s 
investors, the new strategy did not appear to offer the cash-flow smooth-
ing benefit that Ashutosh had hoped for when he launched Actifio One in 
February 2015.

Chapter 3. Road Map for Growing Faster via 
Geography
A company aspiring to grow faster from current or new geography ought to 
start by assessing how well the current CEO’s skills fit with the demands of a 
geographic expansion strategy as we explored in Chapter 2.
I. Diagnose Growth Strategy
The CEO should start by assessing the company’s current geographic growth 
strategy—assembling a team along the lines presented in Chapter 2 but focus-
ing on a different set of questions. To that end, the CEO ought to do the 
following:
• 
Develop a detailed description of the company’s current 
growth strategy with respect to geography. To that end, 
the strategy team should gather data to answer the fol-
lowing questions:
• 
What proportion of the company’s revenue comes 
from each geography in which it currently sells?
• 
Are the key customers in these geographies 
organizations or individuals?
• 
If the key customers are organizations, do 
they share common characteristics—such as 
industries, size (e.g., number of employees), or 
attitude toward new technologies (e.g., early- or 
late-adopters)?
• 
If the key customers are individuals, do they 
share common characteristics such as age range, 
education level, income, or attitude toward new 
technologies?
• 
Based on these common characteristics, what 
customer groups within these geographies are 
contributing most to the company’s current 
revenues?
• 
Who are the company’s competitors in these 
geographies and what are their shares of the 
segment?
• 
In which geographies does the company lead?

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
218
• 
How fast are the markets for the company’s 
products in these geographies growing, and what 
factors are driving that growth?
• 
Why is the company leading in those geography, and 
how sustainable is that lead?
• 
In which segments is the company lagging?
• 
How fast are these segments growing and what 
factors are driving that growth
• 
Why is the company lagging in those segments, 
and how difficult would it be for the company to 
improve its competitive position?
II. Envision Growth Strategy
Once the strategy team has answered these questions, the CEO should lead 
a process for envisioning a growth strategy from current or new geographies. 
The team should break into two smaller groups—one to analyze potential 
growth from current geographies and another to assess opportunities from 
new geographies—that work in parallel.
Current Geographies
To that end, the team should brainstorm, evaluate, and choose a growth strat-
egy from among many creative options through the following steps.
• 
Brainstorm many possible growth vectors among current 
geographies. The team should base these ideas on four 
principles:
• 
Listen to customers in locations where the company 
is winning and losing—discussing customer pain 
points and unmet needs.
• 
Study fast-growing rivals and identify which 
strategies are contributing most to their rapid 
growth in those locations.
• 
Seek deeper understanding of the trends underlying 
customer pain and rivals’ rapid growth.
• 
Encourage participants not to self-censor and to 
generate both blue sky and more-grounded ideas.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
219
• 
Rank the growth vectors based on criteria such as these:
• 
The size, growth, and profitability of the market 
segments
• 
The company’s current or potential competitive 
advantage
• 
The net present value of the investment required to 
implement the strategy
• 
Scrutinize the best ideas by conducting more in-depth 
analysis such as customer interviews, cost analysis, and 
competitor analysis.
• 
Articulate the two best ideas emerging from this process 
in clear and specific terms. The growth strategies should 
answer questions such as the following:
• 
In which current geographies should the company 
seek to expand?
• 
What are the company’s market share targets by 
year in those geographies?
• 
What products or services will the company offer 
customers in those geographies?
• 
Why does the company believe that customers 
in these geographies will prefer its products over 
competitors’?
• 
Will the company sell the product via direct sales, 
distributors, or other means?
• 
How much capital will be required to implement the 
strategy?
• 
What does the company estimate will be the net 
present value of that investment?
New Geographies
To develop options for growth from new geographies, teams should do the 
following:
• 
Develop a list of 50 or more possible countries from 
which to consider future growth

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
220
• 
Pick the 10 most compelling of these by ranking each 
countries’ potential revenue for the company, revenue 
growth rate, and factors boosting and inhibiting the coun-
try’s revenue growth potential
• 
For these 10 countries, evaluate the CAGE distance 
between each and the company’s core geography. Teams 
should seek detailed data on each of the four CAGE fac-
tors from sources including:
• 
Interviewing professors with country-specific 
cultural, political, and economic expertise
• 
Meeting with government officials in the countries 
to understand their role in granting licenses and 
influencing the purchase and use of the company’s 
product
• 
Speaking with taxation and financial services experts 
within the country
• 
Listening to potential customers in these countries 
to assess the likelihood that they would purchase 
the company’s product
• 
Rank the 10 countries based on this:
• 
The size, growth, and profitability of the local market 
for your company’s products
• 
Its CAGE distance between your company’s home 
geography
• 
The company’s current or potential competitive 
advantage in the country
• 
The net present value of the investment required to 
implement the strategy
• 
Scrutinize the most attractive countries by conducting 
more in-depth analysis such as customer interviews, cost 
analysis, and competitor analysis.
• 
For the two most compelling countries emerging from 
this process, articulate the growth strategy by answering 
questions such as the following:
• 
In which customers segments will the company 
compete within the country?
• 
What are the company’s market share targets by 
year in the country?

Disciplined Growth Strategies
221
• 
What products or services will the company offer 
those customers?
• 
Why does the company believe that customers will 
prefer its products over competitors’?
• 
Will the company sell the product via direct sales, 
distributors, or other means?
• 
How much capital will be required to implement the 
strategy?
• 
What does the company estimate will be the net 
present value of that investment?
Once the two teams have completed their analysis, the CEO should decide 
whether to seek resources to implement geographic expansion from current 
or new geographies—and if so, how to sequence them. To that end, the CEO 
might consider ranking the proposed geographic growth strategies based on 
the following criteria:
• 
Contribution to near-term revenue growth
• 
Capital and human resource requirements
• 
Expected time to generate results
• 
Potential for unexpected negative surprises
Netflix applied this approach in conceiving of its strategy to expand into 150 
more countries between 2015 and 2017. Most interestingly, Netflix’s empha-
sis in plotting its global strategy was on the similarities across countries of 
customer groups. Netflix used detailed information about how its customers 
use its service—measuring factors such as what shows they watch, how much 
time they watch them, on which devices—to identify 2,000 clusters based 
on viewers’ tastes for specific types of programming.1 Netflix customers in 
these clusters live in different countries. Todd Yellin, Netflix’s head of product 
innovation told the Telegraph that 90% of Japanese anime shows on Netflix are 
watched by people outside Japan. Moreover, Yellin found that there were 15 
people around the world in his cluster who were spread out from “Dalston in 
East London to Bangalore, India.”2 Nevertheless, Netflix did not believe that 
simply distributing the same content to such clusters around the world would 
achieve its ends. The company also planned to create international content in 
many languages—adding Arabic, Korean, Simplified and Traditional Chinese to 
the 17 languages it already supported.3 Moreover, Netflix added the Spanish 
language shows described earlier in the chapter. In 2016, Hastings hoped to 
produce more international content. “We have a show in Germany, in France, 
in Spain, in Italy, several in Brazil, two in Mexico, several in Japan, but that 
needs to be 5x or 10x. We have to localize product, expand content and 
all that content needs to be available globally,” Hastings told the Telegraph.4

In developing its global growth strategy, Netflix followed two of the important 
principles underlying the steps for envisioning growth strategy. First, it should 
be based on ambitious goals founded on detailed analysis of relevant data. 
Second, effective geographic growth strategies flow from original ideas about 
how to deliver compellingly better value to customers.
III. Execute Growth Strategy
Having assessed the company’s current growth strategy and envisioning a 
future strategy, the final step is to execute that strategy so that the ­company 
can achieve the desired results. Successful implementation of a geographic 
growth strategy will depend on the same general principles outlined in 
Chapter 2.
For growth strategies that involve expanding to new geographies, the CEO 
must take additional steps:
• 
Meet with leaders in the new country to explain the 
company’s goals and intended benefits to the country.
• 
Develop relationships with relevant regulators and obtain 
required licenses and permits.
• 
Establish partnerships where appropriate with local legal 
and accounting firms.
• 
Forge distribution and marketing partnerships.
• 
Establish mechanisms for collecting and disbursing cash 
and paying taxes.
Chapter 4. Road Map for Growing Faster via 
New Products
A company aspiring to grow faster from new products ought to start by 
assessing how well the current CEO’s skills fit with the demands of a product 
expansion strategy as we explored in Chapter 2.

product areas and what are their shares of the 
segment?
•

Why is the company leading in those product 
categories and how sustainable is that lead?

Why is the company lagging in those product 
categories, and how difficult would it be for the 
company to improve its competitive position?

II. Envision Growth Strategy
Once the strategy team has answered these questions, the CEO should lead

Amazon and New Relic followed many of these steps in developing their AWS 
and Insight products, respectively. Bezos clearly recognized that there would 
be a large market opportunity to sell large organizations access to AWS once 
it worked well for Amazon’s e-commerce operations and had been made eas-
ier to use for companies outside Amazon. It is not clear whether Amazon set 
specific market share targets for AWS—however, given what has been written 
about his focus on measuring specific factors that determine customer satis-
faction, growth, and productivity, market share goals would fit within Amazon’s 
culture. The case presented in this chapter also makes it clear that AWS con-
tinues to receive investment from Amazon to keep the breadth and quality 
of its services ahead of rivals—thus securing its market leadership and con-
tributing to scale economies that contribute to its relatively high ­profitability 
and significant contribution to Amazon’s profits. New Relic took a different 
approach to developing Insight and its other new products. Specifically, Cirne 
spent a significant amount of time listening to its enterprise customers and 
gaining deep insights into what new products could relieve the pressure on IT 
operations managers. Moreover, Cirne showed inventiveness in developing a 
marketing strategy for New Relic that would turn influential users of its tech-
nology—Ruby on Rails developers—into passionate and effective advocates 
of its products. In this way, New Relic was able to invest more in product 
development and less in sales and marketing.

Acquiring New Products
To develop options for growth from new products, teams should do the 
following:
• 
In the same way as the team seeking to build new 
­products, the team should brainstorm many possible 
growth ­vectors based on four principles:
• 
Listen to customers in locations where the company 
is winning and losing—discussing customer pain 
points and unmet needs.
• 
Study fast-growing rivals and identify which 
strategies are contributing most to their rapid 
growth in those locations.
• 
Seek deeper understanding of the trends underlying 
customer pain and rivals’ rapid growth.
• 
Encourage participants not to self-censor and to 
generate both blue sky and more-grounded ideas.
• 
Develop a list of at least five possible new product 
­categories from which to consider future growth.
• 
Rank each product categories’ potential revenue for the 
company, revenue growth rate, and factors boosting and 
inhibiting the product’s revenue growth potential.
• 
For the most attractive new product categories, ­evaluate 
the company’s potential peak market share. Teams should 
seek detailed data on factors likely to determine the 
company’s success in the most attractive product catego-
ries by doing this:
• 
Interviewing potential customers to identify and 
rank the criteria they use to compare competing 
suppliers, how they rate those suppliers on the 
criteria, and what they see as their biggest unmet 
needs.
• 
Meet with technology experts and professors to 
envision different scenarios about how relevant 
technology is likely to evolve to help satisfy those 
unmet needs better than do rivals.
• 
Evaluate the capabilities required to outperform 
rivals in the new product categories.
• 
Assess the strength of the company’s capabilities 
relative to those of its competitors.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
227
• 
Consider options for how to close this capability 
gap—including hiring key people or acquiring a 
company that can provide the needed capabilities.
• 
For the two most compelling product categories emerg-
ing from this process, articulate the growth strategy by 
answer questions such as the following:
• 
To which customer segments will the company sell 
the new product?
• 
What are the company’s market share targets for 
the new product?
• 
Why does the company believe that customers will 
prefer its products over competitors’?
• 
Which company making that product will be acquired?
• 
How will the company integrate the acquired 
company?
• 
Will the company sell the product via direct sales, 
distributors, or other means?
• 
How much capital will be required to complete the 
acquisition?
• 
What does the company estimate will be the net 
present value of that investment?
Localytics used many of these principles in its acquisition of Splitforce. Aggarwal 
realized that its customers would appreciate its A/B testing capability and that 
he could only apply Splitforce’s technology to help Localytics customers if 
he could persuade its key people to join Localytics and to work diligently to 
realize the merger’s potential. To that end, Aggarwal met with key people at 
Splitforce, assured himself that they fit culturally with Localytics, worked out 
the details of how to merge their combined products and capabilities, and cre-
ated a schedule of handing out equity to how well Splitforce’s key people met 
jointly agreed-on objectives. Once the two teams have completed their analy-
sis, the CEO should decide whether to seek resources to implement product 
growth strategies—from building or acquiring new products—and if so, how 
to sequence them. To that end, the CEO might consider ranking the proposed 
product growth strategies based on the following criteria:
• 
Contribution to near-term revenue growth
• 
Capital and human resource requirements
• 
Expected time to generate results
• 
Potential for unexpected negative surprises

III. Execute Growth Strategy
Having assessed the company’s current growth strategy and envisioning a 
future strategy, the final step is to execute that strategy so that the company 
can achieve the desired results. For growth strategies that involve building new 
products, the CEO must:
• 
Win Board and shareholder support for building the new 
products
• 
Dedicate product development teams to the high-prior-
ity, new product categories
• 
Encourage those teams to be interdisciplinary—includ-
ing sales, marketing, engineers, finance—and to work with 
early-adopter customers
• 
Urge the teams to build prototypes of the new product, 
give it to those customers, and get their feedback
• 
Evaluate whether new manufacturing, supply, distribution, 
and marketing and sales strategies will be needed for the 
new products
• 
Provide the resources required to bolster the company’s 
skills
• 
Actively support the new product launches
For growth strategies that involve acquiring a company that supplies the new 
products, the CEO must:
• 
Form an interdisciplinary team to consider potential 
acquisition candidates within the new product industry
• 
Set specific acquisition candidate evaluation criteria as 
detailed earlier in the chapter:
• 
Industry attractiveness
• 
Better off
• 
NPV > 0
• 
Ease of integration
• 
Rank candidates based on these criteria:
• 
Meet with key people in the target company to assess 
their fit
• 
Discuss methods of combining products and capabilities
• 
Agree on compensation terms for key people

Disciplined Growth Strategies
229
• 
Negotiate deal terms and finalize contracts
• 
Manage integration so that combined companies appear 
seamless to customers when deal closes
Chapter 5. Road Map for Growing Faster via 
Capabilities
Before building a road map for growing faster via capabilities, a company’s 
board ought to assess whether the current CEO will be capable of creating 
and implementing such a strategy. To make that assessment the board should 
follow a process along the lines we discussed in the road map for growth via 
customer groups in Chapter 2. The outcome of this process should either 
make the decision to keep the current CEO or find a new one.
I. Diagnose Growth Strategy
The CEO should start by assessing the company’s current capabilities-based 
growth strategy—assembling a team along the lines presented in Chapter 2 
but through the following process:
• 
By interviewing customers, analyzing competitors, and 
assessing the company’s current capabilities develop a 
detailed description of the company’s current growth 
strategy with respect to capabilities. To that end, the 
strategy team should gather data to answer the following 
questions:
• 
What specific, ranked criteria—for example, price, 
selection, quality—do your current customers use 
to decide among suppliers of the products your 
company provides?
• 
What are the critical capabilities that companies in 
the industry must possess to satisfy each of these 
customer purchase criteria?
• 
Compared to the industry’s fastest-growing rivals, 
how well do customers perceive that the company 
is satisfying each of the purchase criteria?
• 
How do the industry’s fastest-growing rivals and the 
company perform these capabilities?

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
230
• 
In which capabilities does the company currently 
outperform these rivals? In what ways might rivals 
undermine the company’s advantage in these 
capabilities over the next five years?
• 
In which capabilities does the company currently 
lag these rivals? In what ways might the company 
change the way it performs these capabilities to 
outperform rivals over the next five years?
Answering these questions thoroughly will provide the company with an 
objective assessment of its capabilities.
II. Envision Growth Strategy
Next the CEO should lead a process for envisioning a growth strategy from 
current or new capabilities.
In order to create independent perspectives, the team should break into two 
smaller groups—one to analyze potential growth from current capabilities 
and another to assess opportunities that would require a changed capability 
portfolio—that work in parallel.
Current Capabilities
The team should brainstorm, evaluate, and choose a growth strategy from 
among many creative options through the following steps:
• 
Brainstorm many possible growth opportunities. The 
team should base these ideas on four principles:
• 
Listen to customers where the company is winning 
and losing—discussing customer pain points and 
unmet needs.
• 
Study fast-growing rivals and identify which 
strategies are contributing most to their rapid 
growth in those locations.
• 
Seek deeper understanding of the trends underlying 
customer pain and rivals’ rapid growth.
• 
Encourage participants not to self-censor and to 
generate both blue sky and more-grounded ideas.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
231
• 
Rank the growth opportunities based on criteria such as 
these:
• 
The size, growth, and profitability of the market 
segments
• 
The fit between the company’s capabilities and 
the requirements for competitive success in each 
segment
• 
The net present value of the investment required to 
implement the strategy
• 
Scrutinize the best ideas by conducting more in-depth 
analysis such as customer interviews, capabilities and cost 
analysis, and competitor analysis.
• 
Articulate the two best ideas emerging from this process 
in clear and specific terms. The growth strategies should 
answer questions such as the following:
• 
In which new markets should the company seek to 
expand?
• 
What are the company’s market share targets by 
year in those geographies?
• 
What products or services will the company offer 
customers in those geographies?
• 
Why does the company believe that customers 
in these geographies will prefer its products over 
competitors’?
• 
What capabilities will the company be able to use to 
share in the selected markets?
• 
Will the company sell the product via direct sales, 
distributors, or other means?
• 
How much capital will be required to implement the 
strategy?
• 
What does the company estimate will be the net 
present value of that investment?

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
232
New Capabilities
To evaluate whether growth opportunities will require new capabilities, the 
team should brainstorm, evaluate, and choose a growth strategy from among 
many creative options through steps similar to the ones described for current 
capabilities. The most significant difference between the two is that the team 
should focus with particular objectivity on four questions:
• 
Can the company build new capabilities required to gain 
a significant share of the growth opportunities identified 
by the team?
• 
If so, does the team have concrete recommendations 
regarding how to build these new capabilities?
• 
Will the new capabilities enable the company to grow 
faster than rivals contending for the growth opportunities?
• 
Will the profit from capturing the growth opportunities 
more than offset the investment required to build these 
new capabilities?
Once the two teams have completed their analysis, the CEO should choose 
from among the proposed capabilities-based strategies—and if so, how to 
sequence them.
The CEO might rank the proposed capabilities-based growth strategies based 
on the following criteria:
• 
Contribution to near-term revenue growth
• 
Capital and human resource requirements
• 
Expected time to generate results
• 
Potential for unexpected negative surprises
Following these steps can boost a company’s growth. As we saw in Chapter 
5, Apple’s success in the smartphone industry flowed from applying—with 
modifications—the capabilities it had developed by competing with the iPod 
in the MP3 player market. Specifically, Apple’s used its excellent skills in hard-
ware design, supply chain, marketing, and customer service to the iPod and 
iPhone. Moreover, Apple applied its skills at partnering with others differently 
with the iPod and iPhone. Whereas Apple’s iPod benefited from its partnering 
skills in building iTunes; Apple formed different partnerships—with AT&T and 
other wireless service providers and with app developers (creating the App 
Store)—to spur the iPhone’s success.

233
III. Execute Growth Strategy
Having assessed the company’s current growth strategy and envisioning a 
future strategy, the final step is to execute that strategy so that the company 
can achieve the desired results.
Successful implementation of a capabilities-based growth strategy will depend 
on the same general principles outlined in Chapter 2.
For growth strategies that involve creating new capabilities, the CEO must 
take additional steps:
• 
Identify the capabilities required to gain share in the new 
market.
• 
Evaluate the fit between the company’s capabilities and 
the ones required for competitive success in the new 
market.
• 
Brainstorm ways to close the capability gap including 
these:
• 
Acquiring a company with the needed capabilities
• 
Partnering with firms that excel in the needed 
capabilities
• 
Hire experts in the needed capabilities
• 
Modify existing capabilities to better fit them to the 
competitive requirements of the new market
• 
Choose and implement the best option(s) for closing the 
capability gap.
Chapter 6. Road Map for Creating a Growth 
Culture
A company aspiring to create a growth culture ought to start by assessing 
how well the current CEO’s skills fit with the demands of a creating a growth 
culture. Since a company’s culture so strongly reflects the values and conduct 
of its CEO, if the CEO is not able to create a growth culture, the company’s 
board may need to find a new one.

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
234
To that end, the board should hire an independent consultant to investigate 
and reach conclusions about the current CEO regarding questions such as 
the following:
• 
Has the company sustained industry-leading revenue 
growth?
• 
If not, does the board believe that the company has in 
place a practical strategy to boost its revenue growth?
• 
Does the company encourage and provide resources to 
employees so they can test and develop new products?
• 
If so, have these employee innovation resources led to 
measurable revenue growth improvement?
• 
If not, does the CEO encourage departments to fight for 
limited resources and insist on making all key decisions?
• 
If not, is the CEO open to and capable of changing the 
company’s culture to encourage growth?
Based on the answers to these questions, the board will be able to make a 
more informed decision about whether or not to keep the current CEO. If 
not, the board ought to find a CEO who can create a growth culture and man-
age the CEO out of an executive role at the company.
I. Diagnose Culture
The board-chosen CEO should start by assessing the company’s current cul-
ture—assembling a team along the lines presented in Chapter 2 but focusing 
on the following questions:
• 
Does the company have a well-defined culture?
• 
If so,
• 
What are the company’s values?
• 
What stories does the CEO tell to explain each of 
the values to employees and others?
• 
Does the CEO believe passionately that these 
values are important? If so, why?
• 
Do the company’s values inspire current employees 
and help attract new ones? If so, which employees 
were inspired and/or attracted to the company by 
which values and why?
• 
Does the company use its values to hire, promote, 
and manage people out of the company?

Disciplined Growth Strategies
235
• 
Do the company’s values motivate employees to 
take actions that help the company attract and 
retain customers? If so, which employees helped 
attract and retain which customers and why did 
their actions motivate these customers?
• 
If not—possibly assuming a new CEO has been brought 
in to create a growth culture,
• 
To assess why the company is lagging rivals, is the 
company’s revenue growing faster than the industry? 
If not, why not?
• 
To evaluate whether its culture is attracting and 
motivating top talent, is the company’s employee 
turnover and productivity better than its industry? 
If not, why not? Compared to rivals, does the 
company attract more so-called A Players? If not, 
why not?
• 
To determine whether its culture is encouraging 
employees to win and keep customers, does the 
company have a high net promoter score—the 
likelihood that a current customer will recommend 
the company enthusiastically to others? If not, why 
not?
II. Envision Growth Culture
A CEO should use the answers to these questions to reach a conclusion 
about whether the company has a strong growth culture or needs to create 
one. If the company’s growth culture is helping spur industry-beating revenue 
growth, the CEO must focus on keeping the culture from becoming so rigid 
that it impedes growth. And if the company needs to create a growth culture, 
it should do so as described below.
Create Growth Culture
The company should create a growth culture through the following steps:
• 
Identify key stakeholders and ask them what they want:
• 
Listen to current and potential customers to 
identify specific actions by the company’s employees 
that will encourage them to buy and recommend 
the company’s products.

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
236
• 
Study fast-growing rivals to identify the attributes 
of their cultures that help them to attract talented 
employees and motivate them to act in ways that 
create and sustain customer loyalty.
• 
Listen to current and potential employees to 
identify specific values and conduct that would 
encourage them to join and contribute to the 
company.
• 
Develop a list of values at the intersection of three sets:
• 
What the CEO believes are the values essential to 
achieving the company’s mission
• 
The values that will attract and motivate the most 
talented employees
• 
What employees should do in product development 
and service to attract and retain customers
• 
Develop compelling stories that the CEO and other 
executives can use to make the values meaningful to 
employees.
• 
Incorporate the values into employee interviews and 
performance evaluations.
• 
If employees act in ways consistent with the company’s 
values, encourage their career development and reward 
them accordingly.
Keep Growth Culture from Calcifying
If a company is already growing faster than the industry, the CEO should 
investigate—possibly with help from independent consultants—whether the 
company is becoming complacent by taking the following steps:
• 
Ask employees who quit the company why they left, 
where they went and, and why the new employer was a 
better option for them.
• 
Ask the former managers of those employees why they 
think the employee left.
• 
If the manager and the employee have a different percep-
tion, investigate what might be causing the difference.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
237
• 
Ask former customers why they stopped buying from the 
company, which supplier they buy from now, and why that 
supplier is better for them.
• 
Ask the former sales person for those customers to 
explain why they think the customer switched to a rival.
• 
If the sales person and the customer have a different per-
ception, investigate what might be causing the difference.
• 
Interview industry experts and potential customers to 
seek information about trends in technology, new rivals, 
and evolving unmet needs that might threaten the com-
pany’s business strategy.
• 
Based on this analysis, consider which aspects of the 
company’s’ culture ought to change in order to encour-
age the company to continue its rapid growth.
As we see in Chapter 7, growth comes from leaders who pick the right values 
and reinforce them through their own behavior; their choices of whom to 
hire, promote, and fire; how they set goals and encourage people to achieve 
them; and what they learn from success and failure.
A case in point is Nutanix that had grown at an average rate of 186% in the 
four years ending July 2016 and went public in October 2016—valuing its 
$445 million in 2016 sales at $4.5 billion on November 23, 2016.
Nutanix CEO Dheeraj Pandey created a culture that blended humility in 
the face of its customers with bravado toward rivals. As Pandey explained, 
­empathy for employees, customers, and partners is the key to the company’s 
phenomenal success. Said Pandey, “Empathy for individuals can lead to great 
things. First is employees. They are fully in the company, they signed on. Second 
is customers—they signed on as well. Third is partners who can benefit from 
network effects.”
Nutanix encourages its employees to work together. According to Pandey, 
“We use Yammer as a way to keep our organization flat. We operate in 28 or 
29 countries and our people can communicate with others at almost any time 
of day. Even though they don’t see each other in person, they feel close.”
It was not all sweetness and light—Pandey sought to give customers more 
value than competitors did. As he said, unlike in the past, customers have 50 
competitors from which to choose so Nutanix must “have empathy for cus-
tomers, and give to them before it can expect to get.” There is a dichotomy 
at Nutanix. “We are humble in the presence of our customers and aggressive 
with the competition,” Pandey explained.

Chapter 8 | Growth Road Maps
238
III. Execute Growth Culture
Having assessed the company’s culture and envisioning a growth culture, the 
final step is to change the culture so that the company can achieve the desired 
results.
To implement the envisioned growth culture, the CEO should:
• 
Meet with employees to ask them what they think the 
company should value and work with them to embrace 
the values of the new culture.
• 
Clearly articulate the company’s values and tell stories 
that illustrate how the new values helped people in prac-
tical situations—making life better for employees and 
customers and helping the company generate industry-
leading revenues.
• 
Take clear actions that indicate the CEO is following the 
new values and expects employees to do so as well.
• 
Change the interview process to screen out potential 
employees who do not fit with the new culture.
• 
Link reward systems to employee conduct that reinforces 
the value of the new culture.
• 
By getting objective feedback from employees, custom-
ers, investors, industry experts, and others, fight forces 
that make new culture overly rigid so the company can 
adapt well to change.
Chapter 7. Road Map for Building Growth 
Trajectories
In Chapter 7, we identified a common growth trajectory that chains together 
some or all of these five dimensions to sustain a company’s long-term growth:
• 
Create a growth culture to help build an effective team 
to launch and grow the company.
• 
Develop a new product that uniquely satisfies the unmet 
needs of a specific customer group.
• 
Build capabilities—for example, product development, 
manufacturing, distribution, sales, and service—to ­provide 
and service the product.

Disciplined Growth Strategies
239
• 
Add new capabilities—such as manufacturing, sales, and 
service—to support the sale of the product to a similar 
customer group in new geographies.
• 
Consider whether the product can be sold as is—or 
modified—to generate revenue growth by selling to a 
different customer group.
• 
Before the current product matures, develop or acquire 
a new product that will enable the company to tap the 
growth potential of a new, fast-growing market opportu-
nity. Revisit the previous steps in the growth trajectory as 
needed to sustain revenue growth from the new product.
As a company considers which dimensions of growth to investigate as pos-
sible sources of industry-leading revenue growth, the CEO should follow the 
specific approaches for the most relevant growth dimension as detailed in 
Chapters 2 through 6 and earlier in this appendix.
