I’VE ACCUMULATED A lot more time 
with iPhone X since last issue, and the 
more I use it, the more excited I get 
about where the iPhone, as a platform, 
is heading over the next few years. 
That’s not to say the tech in this model 
isn’t fantastic — the TrueDepth 
fdphud/#Idfh#LG/#wkh#ľxlg#jhvwxudo#dqg#
navigational changes resulting from 
the Home button’s removal, and 
Apple’s pushing of AR and machine 
learning are packed full of promise.
Now we’re in 2018, with Apple’s 
next Worldwide Developers Conference 
just a few months away and bound to 
deliver the next wave of evolution to developers’ tools, I’m hugely 
excited. More so than normal at this time of year, when Apple’s 
world can be a bit quiet. It feels like third-party developers have 
barely scraped the surface of what 2017’s software improvements 
allow, and interesting experiences should keep coming this year.
Apple issued human interface guidelines for AR apps only 
toward the end of last year. It’s clear that there’s an ongoing 
period of experimentation and learning when it comes to AR, and 
that building experiences around it might be more bleeding-edge 
than third-party iOS development involving a multi-touch glass 
surface was back at its inception a decade ago.
Must-have AR apps are thin on the ground right now, but I 
don’t see that as a sign of them being a passing fad. There’s a 
huge amount of potential for developers to tap into, beyond 
those that use machine vision to composite your image with 
qhz#idvklrqv/#phdvxuh#|rxu#krph#iru#qhz#ixuqlvklqjv#ru#d#uhĽw/#
or indulge your desire for computer-enhanced fun.
And if talk of the TrueDepth camera’s tech being extended to 
the rear camera in a future model proves true, as seems likely, 
then AR and machine learning, and apps built around them, are 
sure to be a key driver of future iPhone sales. But I’m getting 
ahead of myself. One thing’s for sure: the iPhone is in a great 
position to go from strength to strength throughout 2018, even 
before we reach the next hardware iteration.

What do you 
want to see 
in iOS? Tell us 
at letters@
maclife.com
I’m a decades-long subscriber and faithful reader. Can’t 
tell you how many helpful tips I’ve followed, for which I 
never fail to be astonished and grateful. I’m having a 
few issues of slowness on my MacBook Pro and was 
keen to try the “essential support articles” you list in 
your Ask section — macOS Recovery, Safe Mode, etc. When I type in 
the addresses given, though, I get an error 404. What am I doing 
wrong? CHRISTIAN DICKERSON
We’ve checked that our bit.ly links are working, so our best guess is a 
typing error. Maybe it’s our sans-serif typeface that’s confusing things. 
All the links are along the lines of bit.ly/mlrecovery (that’s “ML” as in 
Mac|Life, only all lower-case), with no period at the end.
History starts today
I have been told that my 
external drive, used solely 
for Time Machine, needs to be 
reformatted each time a new 
macOS is installed. Is this 
necessary? STEVE RAFFIN
Doesn’t sound right to us, no. 
A key beneﬁt of Time Machine, 
for major or minor OS updates, 
is the ability to start up in 
macOS Recovery and see a 
list of exactly which version of 
macOS was installed, and then 
roll back to a much older one if 
an unforeseen issue arises. 
Unless you’re using an SSD 
for Time Machine, which High 
Sierra will insist on converting 
to APFS, we’d leave it alone as 
long as possible.
The iPhone tech I’m 
looking forward to...
Lay off the gimmicks! I want a 
phone with long battery life, a 
decent camera, the ability to get 
local weather and news reports, 
and not much else. Hearing 
sticking issue for me is Boot 
Camp and the sad situation 
where I cannot easily switch 
from Windows to macOS 
because the bootcamp.exe 
taskbar icon no longer works, no 
doubt because the .exe cannot 
work with the new APFS ﬁling 
system. I am happy to upgrade, 
but only once Apple releases a 
new bootcamp.exe in an update. 
I can’t understand why we are 
still waiting for this to be ﬁxed. 
I am sure many other readers 
feel my pain. LEE BROMLEY
Apple still says the only way 
to use Boot Camp with High 
Sierra is to restart your Mac 
holding down the Opt key and 
use Startup Manager to pick 
between your Windows and 
macOS volumes. High Sierra 
seems to have broken so many 
things, though, some of them 
major security settings (see 
our Start section), that it’s 
anyone’s guess how long it will 
take Apple to get around to a 
ﬁx for this particular issue. In 
the meantime, you could try 
alternatives like Virtualbox, 
covered in this issue. Anyone 
have anything else to add to 
the High Sierra wish list?
about a possible new iPhone SE 
is the ﬁrst thing that’s given me 
hope. I want an iPhone that ﬁrst 
of all is a phone, not a miniature 
computer with games, etc. 
Spare me. I’d like memory 
enough to store phone numbers, 
addresses, etc. but no gimmicks 
(like AR and millions of apps). 
Some connectedness with 
national and local news and 
weather is ﬁne, but don’t 
overdo it. I don’t need iCloud 
connections, either. Make it a 
simple machine, like the ﬁrst 
Macs were. I want ease of 
operation, please — and don’t 
always make things change. 
EMILY ENGEL
We hear you, Emily. It looks 
like Apple is committed to 
having a whole range of iPhone 
models available, so you can 
ﬁnd the one that suits you. 
Back to Boot Camp
I upgraded to High Sierra 
upon its release only then to 
downgrade back to Sierra. The 
With High Sierra, switching between 
macOS and WIndows takes a restart.

FEED YOUR MIND. FEAST YOUR EYES.
START

Feed your mind. Feast your eyes.
One size 
doesn’t ﬁt all
The top-selling iPhone isn’t 
what you thought…
YOU MIGHT ASSUME that Apple’s newest 
iPhone will always be its best-selling, but it ain’t 
necessarily so. Market analyst Canalys looked at 
the numbers in Q3 2017 (Apple’s ﬁscal fourth 
quarter) and reports that iPhone 7 was the world’s 
top-selling smartphone in the quarter, with 
13 million units shipped. The iPhone 6S — originally 
released in 2015 — came in second, with 7.9 million 
shipments. The iPhone 8, which launched in mid-
September, did not even make the top ﬁve.
Sales of the iPhone 8 were strong, although not 
as strong as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus on their 
release in the same quarter of 2016. In another 
twist, the iPhone 8 Plus outsold its regular-sized 
sibling, shipping 6.3 million units compared to the 
iPhone 8’s 5.4 million. This is the ﬁrst quarter that 
a Plus model has outsold the standard version.
Of course, everything could change dramatically 
in the next quarter with the revised iPhone range 
including iPhone X and an iPhone SE 2 rumored 
for release early in 2018… But the strong sales of 
older models such as the iPhone 6S and SE 
suggest that Apple’s strategy of multiple models 
is appealing to buyers. As Canalys puts it, “Apple 
is clearly making a portfolio play here. With the 
launch of the iPhone X, it now has ﬁve tiers of 
iPhone and delivers iOS at more price bands than 
ever before. This is a new strategy for Apple.”

The shape 
of iPhones 
to come?
Apple looks to the future
BY STAFF REPORTERS
LAST QUARTER SAW the arrival of 
iPhone X, the most amazing iPhone 
since the original. But tech doesn’t 
stand still, and Apple certainly 
doesn’t. Some recent Apple patents, 
business moves, and rumors are 
hinting at what might be coming 
down the line.
One such rumor is that Apple is 
working on a dual SIM variant for the 
next range of iPhones, as well as 
pushing in some new gigabit LTE 
technology for faster internet.
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI 
Securities — who has a good track 
record of predicting what Apple will 
do — has shared a report that claims 
the 2018 iPhone upgrades will 
include faster antenna modules. 
Instead of the current 2x2 antenna 
modules, new iPhones could feature 
a 4x4 MIMO setup.
While carriers and networks 
supporting gigabit LTE are few and 
far between at the moment, Apple 
including the new tech will 
future-proof these devices, and 
you’ll have generally faster speeds 
even before your network or carrier 
embraces gigabit LTE.
Kuo also says Apple may be 
experimenting with a dual SIM 
variant to enter its phone line for

seeing a foldable iPhone at some 
point in the future.
Liquidmetal is mentioned as 
a possible material, which would 
make sense since Apple has long had 
exclusive rights to the amorphous 
material in consumer electronics, 
yet so far has done little with it.
The patent also mentions the 
possible use of a micro-LED 
display, which is more energy-

and has previously been rumored for 
inclusion on an Apple Watch. With 
Apple only just now moving to OLED

another change in technology very 
soon, but if Apple’s strategy is now

bid to enhance the user experience.”
Dual LTE capabilities may, 
however, appear not in the regular

phone, possibly a cheaper device for 
developing markets. We won’t know 
for sure until the second half of 2018, 
which is when we expect to see 
Apple release its new handsets.
Meanwhile, news of Apple’s latest 
acquisition has led to speculation 
that better low-light photos may be 
on the cards on iPhones. Apple has 
acquired InVisage Technologies, 
which has developed a material that 
can be used in miniature camera 
modules to enable them to capture 
more light. InVisage says its 
QuantumFilm sensor material

thinner.” This might enable future 
iPhones to have much smaller 
camera systems, much better 
low-light performance, or both.

HESE DAYS, IT seems like 
the iPhone and iPad have 
stolen much of the spotlight 
from the Mac. Apple Stores 
now often devote the majority of 
space to iOS devices. However, 
while Mac sales haven’t shared 
the meteoric rise of iOS devices, 
they have grown steadily over the 
years, often outpacing all or most 
of the PC market. The Mac is still 
critically important to Apple in a 
number of ways, and I hope Apple 
starts showing it in 2018.
The Mac has had a rocky couple 
years. Yes, sales have grown 
steadily (though slowly), but this 
has been thanks almost entirely to 
MacBooks — and that is arguably 
part of the problem. The Mac mini 
hasn’t been updated in three years. 
While you could argue that the Mac 
mini makes up a niche amount of 
Apple’s small desktop sales, it 
isn’t a good look for the company. 
Worse, the Mac Pro hasn’t been 
updated in four years. It became 
such a large problem that Apple 
held a meeting with a handful of 
tech journalists in 2017 to say, 
basically, “We screwed up, and 
there’s a major redesign coming a 
year from now.” Apple rarely gives 
us notice about products coming a 
week from now, let alone a year.
Mac troubles run deeper, 
wkrxjk1#Wkh#vljqlĽfdqwo|#
redesigned 2017 MacBook Pro has 
a handful of persistent problems, 
notably a failure-prone keyboard 
requiring an expensive post-
warranty replacement, and the 
unimpressive Touch Bar, criticized 
for replacing the F-key row 
without adding much usefulness.
Then there’s High Sierra. It, too, 
has stumbled, from glaring user-
idflqj#exjv#wr#qrw0lqvljqlĽfdqw#
under-the-hood problems, and 
even a sheer lack of reasons to 
upgrade. “Re-architecting how 
it stores your data” just ain’t a 
selling point for most people. 
After these stumbles, how does 
Apple help the Mac hit its stride in 
2018 and beyond? I think another 
“Snow Leopard” period is in order, 
though I don’t expect Apple to call 
or even acknowledge it as such. If 
you recall, Apple released Snow 
Leopard in August 2009 with 
virtually no major user features. 
Instead, the update was pitched as 
house cleaning to squash bugs and 
modernize the operating system 
foundation for the future. The Mac 
needs that kind of attention, this 
time in software and hardware. 
Apple may have already gotten 
vwduwhg/#wrr/#dv#d#Ľuvw0hyhu#ģlPdf#
Pro” debuts and the promised 
Mac Pro redesign is on the way. 
The MacBook Pro needs help, 
though, especially since MacBooks 
are, by far, Apple’s biggest seller. 
The keyboard needs to fail far less 
often, and the Touch Bar needs 
much more polish and a better 
sales pitch. And while macOS 
may not need a ton of major new 
features (for now), it certainly 
needs a lot of house cleaning.
Apple has shown that it has the 
ability to slow down and focus on 
Ľ{hv1#Khuhġv#krslqj#wkh#lPdf#Sur#
and forthcoming Mac Pro are the 
start of a positive new trend.

T’S HARD TO imagine now, 
but three years ago, industry 
analysts were seriously 
wondering if Nintendo had a 
future. The Wii U was a failure, 3DS 
hardware was aging rapidly, and 
pdq|#ri#wkh#surĽwv#lq#wkh#jdphv#
industry were moving to iOS. Did 
portable gaming systems like the 
3DS have a future in a world where 
iPhones are so ubiquitous?
2017 was a crucial year for 
Nintendo. Although the Switch 
has been a commercial and 
fulwlfdo#vxffhvv/#lwv#Ľuvw#jdph#
on iOS didn’t sell well. Sales of 
Super Mario Run “did not meet 
expectations,” according to 
Nintendo president Tatsumi 
Kimishima. Despite this, 
Nintendo has continued iOS 
game development, with its 
fourth release, Animal Crossing: 
Pocket Camp, hitting the App 
Store in November 2017. 
In many ways, Animal Crossing

games tend to be about twitch

hard to translate to a touchscreen. 
In contrast, Animal Crossing was 
designed to be slow-paced, a 
game you played for 10 minutes 
and then put away. 
No-one expected the original 
Animal Crossing for GameCube to 
become a cult favorite. In it, you 
arrived on a train and 
found yourself the mayor of a 
town. There was no running and 
jumping, no enemies — and no 
real direction to go. Instead, you

ahead of its time. You weren’t able 
to play through the game in one 
sitting — rather, it was synced to 
the GameCube’s internal clock. To

to spend months returning to the 
game. This is obviously a formula 
better suited for the iPhone than 
your television set. Expectations 
were sky-high for Pocket Camp. 
Could Nintendo’s latest 
experiment meet them?
Pocket Camp has most of 
the elements you expect from an 
Animal Crossing game. You arrive, 
and you’re given your own camp by

animals to come visit. You’ll go 
from area to area in your RV,

collecting resources. 
On one level, you comb the

rocks with a shovel and collect 
rare ores. This is by-the-numbers

Once you have enough 
resources, you are able to craft 
furniture for guests. After you’ve 
done this, the animals will come 
to your camp. It’s very simple 
gameplay, but it’s good fun. 
Ultimately, the personality of 
Animal Crossing is the reason you 
keep playing. It’s charming and 
surreal in all the best ways. I love 
KK Slider, the musician dog. If 
there is a villain in the Animal 
Camp universe, it would be 
Tom Nook, everyone’s favorite 
dishonest raccoon banker.
In some ways, this is the version 
of Animal Crossing that we’ve all 
wanted, with crisp, clean retina 
graphics and vibrant colors. Yet, 
the real problem with Animal 
Crossing is that there’s not 
enough of it. The game can be 
completed in a few days, and 
gameplay is shallow. After you’ve 
invited animals to your camp, 
there’s nothing else to do. This, 
of course, is Nintendo’s point. It 
has been careful to give iOS 
gamers only a taste of its world 
— it isn’t trying to make money 
on these games. It wants you or 
your kids to buy a $200 3DS or a 
$300 Nintendo Switch in order to 
experience the real thing. 
Animal Crossing is free to try, 
but don’t kid yourself — you will 
more than likely end up spending 
money. In-app purchases are the 
worst trend in the history of 
videogaming, but the cynic in 
me suspects that they will make

EXPLAINED Optimize your mouse, keyboard, or trackpad
A
POWER UP WITH  
BETTERTOUCHTOOL
BetterTouchTool (from $2.99, boastr.net) 
is a single utility designed to enhance all of 
your input devices. Using this app, you can 
define all manner of triggers to perform your 
choice of actions.
B
GET ADVANCED  
TRACKPAD GESTURES
Your Mac’s Magic Mouse or trackpad knows 
more gestures than System Preferences 
provides options for. With BetterTouchTool, 
you can create gestures that use up to five 
fingers or a firm press on a trackpad corner.
C
USE SPOTLIGHT
Sure, you can launch apps on your Mac 
by clicking icons in the Applications folder or 
Dock. But it’s often faster to press Cmd+Space 
to fire up Spotlight, type the first few letters 
of an app’s name, and use the arrow keys and 
Return to open what’s selected.
D
ADJUST YOUR KEYBOARD
System Preferences’ Keyboard pane 
has options for fine-tuning how your keyboard 
works, including defining new keyboard 
shortcuts and creating text replacements, 
so that when you type “omw,” for example, 
it automatically inserts “on my way.”
E
EXPLORE YOUR  
MOUSE OPTIONS
Whatever mouse you’re using, the Mouse 
pane provides settings to adjust how it works. 
Tracking speed will make the most difference 
to your Mac experience — ramp it up to what 
you’re comfortable with.
F
UNDERSTAND 
YOUR TRACKPAD
The Trackpad pane offers three tabs full 
of options. Again, tracking speed is worth 
increasing, but also turn on “Tap to click,” 
so you tap lightly to select items on your 
Mac, instead of having to press.

Learn shortcuts in Keyboard Viewer 
(System Preferences > Keyboard).
  
KEYBOARD ACCESS TO 
MENU COMMANDS
To access a menu command without 
navigating menus, press Cmd+Shift+/ 
to bring up Help, and start typing the 
command’s name. Use the arrow keys 
to navigate the options, and Return to 
frqĽup#wkh#rqh#|rx#zdqw1#Wklv#lv#juhdw#
when you know the name of a command 
but don’t recall its whereabouts.
  
DUMP YOUR MOUSE
The mouse is a dated input device, 
and poor ergonomically. Consider 
a trackpad so you can use gestures, or a 
pen-based tablet on which the surface 
is mapped to corresponding points on 
your display — then you can jump to a 
position on-screen by lifting the stylus 
and setting it down elsewhere.
  
USE HOT CORNERS
In the Mission Control pane of 
System Preferences, click Hot 
Corners. In the sheet that appears, 
select what you want to happen when 
you move the pointer into each corner 
of the screen. This can be a super fast 
way to open Mission Control and more.
  
USE A WINDOW MANAGER
Don’t waste time positioning 
windows precisely — get a window 
manager to do it! BetterTouchTool 
has options for this, but Moom ($10, 
manytricks.com) is better. Have it 
instantly snap a window to a user-
ghĽqhg#duhd#e|#xvlqj#d#nh|erdug#
shortcut or gesture, or by dragging out 
the desired position on your screen.
  
OPEN APPS FROM 
THE KEYBOARD
BetterTouchTool enables you to 
set keyboard shortcuts to open favorite 
apps or folders. The action to use is 
Open Application/File/AppleScript. 
Shortcuts using Ctrl+Shift plus a 
letter won’t clash with anything else.
HEY, SIRI!
>>> Saying “Hey, 
Siri” works for 
your iPhone and 
iPad. A workaround can add 
it to your Mac, too. In Siri’s 
System Preferences pane, 
select Customize in the 
Keyboard Shortcut pop-up, 
and use Opt+Space. (This 
differs from the similar 
predeﬁned shortcut in the 
pop-up, which requires you 
to hold those keys, not just 
press them.) In the Keyboard 
pane’s Dictation tab, turn on 
Enhanced Dictation.
Go to the Accessibility 
preferences pane, select 
Dictation, and deﬁne “Hey” 
as the keyword phrase. Click 
the Dictation Commands 
button, check “Enable 
advanced commands,” 
and click + to create a new 
command. In “When I say,” 
type “Siri,” and set Perform 
to Press Keyboard Shortcut. 
Repeat the keyboard 
shortcut from earlier. Click 
Done. Hey, Siri! is now all set!

Find a shortcut
Keyboard shortcuts are a great 
way to speed up workﬂow — it’s easier to 
prod keys than move the pointer. But 
some items don’t have shortcuts, such 
as File > Export as PDF… in TextEdit.
Create a shortcut
In System Preferences > Keyboard 
> Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, click the + at 
the foot of the right-hand pane. Select an 
app, or All Applications if you want the 
shortcut to work everywhere.
Deﬁne a shortcut 
Next to Menu Title, type the menu 
command (including ellipses using Opt+;). 
Click Keyboard Shortcut, type your key 
combination (one that doesn’t clash with 
existing shortcuts), and click Add.

EXPLAINED Automation options
A
UNDERSTAND RULES
The makeup of smart containers varies 
slightly from app to app, but the foundation is 
always rules or conditions (if... then). Figure 
out in plain English what requirements you 
want items to match, and then set about 
defining that using the menu options.
B
START USING 
SMART FOLDERS
In Finder, you can create Smart Folders, which 
are automatically filled with items that match 
your specified criteria. The contents could 
be anything from recently-saved JPEGs to all 
items that you’ve tagged with a red label.
C
SMART PLAYLISTS
Smart Playlists in iTunes provide the 
means to create collections of music that 
continually adapt. For example, you might 
create one for recent additions you haven’t 
played at all, or stuff you love (you’ve rated 
five stars, say) yet haven’t played for months.
D
TEXT REPLACEMENT
If you’re always mistyping, use the Text 
tab in System Preferences’ Keyboard pane. 
There, you’ll find a table in which to specify 
text you want to replace with longer phrases, 
plus system-wide settings for shortcuts, such 
as turning quotation marks “curly” (like that).
E
SMART MAILBOXES
By default, the Mail app provides you 
with a sole Smart Mailbox: Today. This contains 
all of the messages that arrived on the current 
day from all of your accounts. But it’s easy to 
create more useful custom Smart Mailboxes to 
automatically group messages that match your 
specified criteria in each case.

AUTOMATE TASKS
Automator is used to build workflows 
that can perform tasks on your behalf. In the

You can select text and then 
Ctrl-click to run a Google search on it, 
but let’s make a service that uses 
DuckDuckGo. Create a new Service, and 
drag Run AppleScript to the right pane. 
A basic script structure will be added. 
Create a workﬂow
On the return input line, replace 
input with: "https://duckduckgo.com/ 
?q=" & (input as string). This sends the 
text to DuckDuckGo. Add Display 
Webpages beneath the Run AppleScript 
action. This opens the result in Safari.
Save and use
Save the service as “Search with 
DuckDuckGo.” It can now be selected 
from the Services menu when text is 
selected in an app. In System Preferences 
> Keyboard > Shortcuts, create a shortcut 
for instant access to the service.
HOW TO Create a search service in Automator
CREATE MULTI-LINE 
TEXT REPLACEMENTS
In the Text tab of System 
Preferences’ Keyboard pane, you can set 
short phrases to be replaced with longer 
blocks of text. This is great for accessing 
extended characters, and you can also 
paste multi-line text you’ve written 
in TextEdit into the With column.
AUTOMATE QUITTING

If you often have many apps open, 
you can close them all using the Quit All 
Applications action in Automator. Set 
whether apps ask to save changes; you

MAKE AN “UNREAD” MAILBOX
On iOS, Apple provides an Unread 
folder for unread emails. Create a 
Smart Mailbox on your Mac to do the 
same. Simply add a “Message is 
xquhdgĤ#frqglwlrq1#Rswlrqdoo|/#dgg#
d#ģPhvvdjh#lv#qrw#lq#pdloer{#MxqnĤ#
condition to omit junk mail.

It’s easy for emails to get lost 
among the items in your inbox. Create 
a Smart Mailbox with the conditions 
ģPhvvdjh#lv#lq#Pdloer{#Lqer{Ĥ#dqg#

This will contain mails that arrived over 
a week ago and need to be dealt with.

In iTunes, create a Smart Playlist 
with the rule “Last Played not in

HOUSEKEEPING 
>>> For anyone 
who downloads 
and works with 
a lot of ﬁles, Mac 
housekeeping can feel like 
endless tedium. Hazel ($32, 
noodlesoft.com) is designed 
to toil on your behalf. Setting 
it up involves identifying 
speciﬁc folders, then creating 
rules to process ﬁles in those 
folders based on conditions 
that ﬁles must match.
Hazel works in a similar 
manner to Smart Folders. 
So you can, for instance, 
have Hazel examine your 
Downloads folder and send 
any music it ﬁnds to iTunes, 
PDFs to ~/Documents/PDFs, 
and images to Photos. With 
a system like this, anything 
still lurking in Downloads 
can then be safely trashed, 
and Hazel will even empty 
the Trash on a regular basis, 
saving you the hassle 
of doing so yourself.

A
USE iCLOUD
When you fully utilize iCloud, your data 
is instantly available on any of your Macs or 
devices — no more half-finished files scattered 
across multiple computers. This can be a huge 
time-saver and help you work more efficiently.
B
SHARE FOLDERS
In iCloud Drive’s options, you can choose 
to store your entire Desktop and Documents 
folders online. Files in these folders then sync 
across Macs signed into your Apple ID, and are 
available on iOS devices too.
C
SYNC SAFARI ON DEVICES
When using iCloud across your devices, 
you can view a list of Safari tabs from any 
device. Bookmarks and your browsing history 
sync, too. Turn on iCloud Keychain to sync 
logins and payment details.
D
OPTIMIZE PHOTOS
If you’re a keen photographer, consider 
storing all your photos and videos in iCloud. 
Then, even your edits become available on all 
your devices — and your Mac will download 
originals only when there’s space to do so.
E
USE GOOGLE DRIVE
Google Drive gives you 15GB of online 
storage for free. With Google’s Backup and 
Sync app, you can integrate Google Drive into 
Finder to access your Google Docs, and also 
sync specific folders for online backup.
F
CHECK OUT DROPBOX
Dropbox offers only 2GB for free, but 
has very widespread support in apps across all

Create a list
Use your Mac to create lists you 
can access on your devices and share 
with other people. Open Reminders and 
click Add List. Name your new list — “To-
do list” or similar — and drag it where 
you want it in the left-hand pane.
Share your list
When you position the pointer 
over your list, a button appears to the 
right. Click it to open a pop-up menu. In 
the Share With ﬁeld, type the email of a 
person you’d like to share the list with. 
(They must have an iCloud account.)
 
Use your list
Both parties can now use the list, 
which will be updated and synchronized 
across all of their devices. To stop 
sharing a list with someone, select their 
name in the pop-up menu and press 
Delete. You cannot undo this action.
STREAM ALL YOUR MUSIC
>>> So you’re the type of person who enjoys having great sounds 
pumped into your ears at all times. But large music collections 
take up space on your Mac, and are not particularly portable — 
at least not without the hassle of synchronizing tracks, which then eat 
into the relatively limited storage on iPhones and iPads.
If you’re going all-in with the cloud to revitalize your Mac experience, 
consider a music-streaming service. Apple Music will integrate with an 
existing collection in iTunes, and works across macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, 
iTunes for Windows, and even Android, but other services are pretty great 
too, including those from Spotify, Amazon, and Google.

sluggish, consider three things: upgrade

IMPROVE 
ERGONOMICS
>>> Increasingly, people 
use MacBooks rather than 
desktop computers. They’re 
great for portability, but not 
for your back, given that you 
typically type while hunched 
over them. Poor ergonomics 
shouldn’t be ignored — back 
complaints are a major 
problem for computer users.
If you have the space and 
funds, look at getting an 
external display, and connect 
a wireless Apple keyboard 
and trackpad to your 
MacBook. You’ll have more 
screen space to work with, 
and a more natural setup  
for typing and interacting 
with your Mac. Your Mac 
hardware won’t necessarily 
feel like new as a result of 
such changes, but you and 
your back might!

HEN STEVE JOBS unveiled the iPad nearly eight 
years ago, he made the point that it wasn’t just 
a bigger iPhone or a smaller MacBook — it was 
a third kind of device that, for some tasks at 
least, would be better than either. Since then, 
it’s gotten better than even he may have envisaged. But has 
it grown so capable as to take over tasks that used to be the 
bread-and-butter of those older devices?
Well, okay, the trend may be for ever-bigger phones and

its own space. The Mac, on the other hand, has seen Apple’s 
remarkable A-series mobile processors edge ever closer to 
its territory, and not even the super-slim 12-inch MacBook 
can match a tablet’s portability. So is it time to dump the 
desktop and make an iPad your main machine?
Over the next few pages, we’ll take a tour of some key 
apps and accessories that could help make that a real 
possibility. There’s no doubt that today’s iPads are capable 
of some amazing feats, from running recording studios and

If you’re convinced that using your ﬁngers is 
not really working, then Apple’s $99 Pencil may 
narrow your choice: it works only with iPad Pro. 
Third-party pressure-sensitive styluses for smaller 
iPads, we ﬁnd, are less satisfactory.
But there are four iPad models in the range, and 
the 9.7-inch iPad is a bargain. Its A9 processor is not 
far behind the Pro’s A10X in power, and its screen is 
sharp, has good color accuracy, and is brighter.

an overpriced 128GB model at a cost of $399. By 
contrast, the 128GB 9.7-inch iPad is a good buy at 
$429; at $329 with just 32GB, the base conﬁguration 
would be a false economy for full-time use.
Even the iPad Pro’s default 64GB is a little tight, 
and there’s no way to expand it. At $799, we think 
the 10.5-inch model with 256GB hits the sweet 
spot, with fantastic display quality; add Apple’s 
Smart Keyboard ($159) and it’s still more than 
$300 cheaper than a 12-inch MacBook. Cellular 
connectivity, at a crazy $130 extra, is not essential if 
you have an iPhone — just connect the iPad to your 
Personal Hotspot (calling plan permitting). The 12.9-
inch iPad Pro, however, at $949 for 256GB, is worth 
the extra if you need to get lots of work into view.
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is the obvious choice to cover a full 
range of tasks, but isn’t the only option available to you.

arcane reasons, iPad Pro users without a subscription can only view 
documents, while those with other iPad models get free basic editing 
for “non-commercial purposes” — see elw1o|2pvriwbuhvrxufhv.
Desktop dealbreakers
A few of the desktop apps’ more advanced capabilities aren’t available 
even if you pay, which could be a deal-breaker if you need them 
regularly. For example, Word on iPad includes key features such as 
Track Changes, but lacks endnotes and equation editing; and Excel’s 
Pivot Tables can’t be created or manipulated, although Pivot Tables 
already set up in a document are displayed.
To keep in touch with colleagues, FaceTime is ideal if they’re Apple

APPS TO CONSIDER
ANYFONT 
$1.99  anyfont-app.com
iOS handles fonts across apps, but 
has no Font Book to manage them. 
AnyFont accepts standard font 
ﬁles from a Mac via iTunes, email 
attachments, or Dropbox. It’s a little 
cumbersome to use, but a must for 
serious iPad document creation.
DOCUMENTS 6 
Free  readdle.com
iOS 11’s Files app is convenient for 
managing documents, and integrates 
third-party cloud services whose apps 
you’ve installed. But Documents is 
more capable, and can view, play, 
and download ﬁles from the web.
PCALC 
$9.99 pcalc.com
On iPad, PCalc is a solid alternative to 
Apple’s basic, iPhone-only Calculator 
app, with scientiﬁc functions, Reverse 
Polish notation, and more.

drag it to another app. Use 
your other hand if you need 
to switch to another app 
before dropping the item 
in, or ask Siri to open it.
AIRMAIL 
$4.99  airmailapp.com
Apple’s Mail app makes it easy to 
add accounts, and many people ﬁnd 
it works ﬁne. Others complain that 
searching is glitchy and it lacks 
convenience features. For the latter, 
Airmail is fast and lets you write 
messages in HTML or Markdown, 
as well as assigning incoming mail 
to Memo, To Do, or Done.
WORKFLOW 
Free  workflow.is
This Apple-owned utility enables you 
to build workﬂows (series of steps). 
You drag and drop actions, which 
then automate one or more apps to 
achieve your goals. A workﬂow might 
send a preset text, upload your last 
photo to a website, or read you the 
time. The more you use your iPad, 
the more it can help.

Creative thinking
Creative software companies haven’t entirely embraced the iPad as a 
primary platform. Though Photoshop Sketch and Illustrator Draw use 
the touchscreen for freehand graphics, on the whole Adobe’s apps 
assume you’ll take your work back to the Mac. Beyond Adobe, however, 
there are now some very powerful creative apps for iOS. 
Zkloh#Ľop#dqg#WY#hglwruv#qhhg#wrs0hqg#Pdfv/#lRV#dssv#olnh#wkh#

provides most of the features of a desktop photo editor.
Musicians, meanwhile, have a more than decent choice. Again, 
there’s no full equivalent of Mac digital audio workstations (DAWs) like 
Apple’s Logic Pro X, but Cubasis 2.2 ($24.99, vwhlqehuj1qhw) is capable, 
while iPad-only alternatives like Auria Pro ($49.99, dxulddss1frp) 
are impressive if you don’t need roundtripping with desktop apps.
OMNIGRAFFLE 3 
$49.99  omnigroup.com
While sipping their Latte Macchiatos, 
power users swear by OmniGroup’s 
tools for organizing and visualizing 
information. This all-purpose 
diagramming app brings the 
precision of the Mac version to the 
touchscreen; a Pro version ($99.99) 
adds even more advanced features, 
including JavaScript automation.
iOS 11 tip
>>> Before iOS 11, you needed 
a third-party app to open 
Zip archives. Now, tap a .zip 
attachment in Mail, tap 
again after it downloads, and 
tap Preview Content. Each 
Ľoh#lqvlgh#lv#vkrzq#lq#wxuq>#
tap the Share icon to save it 
to Files or open in an app.
PENULTIMATE 
Free  evernote.com
Microsoft OneNote is okay, but many 
people prefer Evernote to organize, 
annotate, and sync their notes. It’s 
free for basic use, but subscriptions 
— from $34.99 per year — give you 
more cloud space and formats and 
syncing to more than two devices. 
Add the Penultimate app to handwrite 
searchable notes on the screen.
As long as iOS is reasonably 
up-to-date, your iPad can run 
business-standard apps like Excel, 
as well as advanced creative apps 
such as LumaFusion.
Apple’s Keynote is ideal for creating and delivering 
presentations, but Microsoft PowerPoint is also available.
Yoink 
$4.99  eternalstorms.at
Drag-and-drop in iOS 11 enables you 
to drag things from one app and drop 
them into another right away. Yoink 
is a holding area for multiple items, 
accessible via Slide Over or Split View 
modes, or as a share sheet extension 
or custom keyboard.
Dropbox 
Free  dropbox.com
iCloud is a practical place to keep 
documents, but Dropbox is more 
versatile and enables you to share 
whole folders with people in an 
instant. With its app installed, 
Dropbox integrates with iOS 11’s 
Files app as well as share sheets.
Dashlane 
Free  dashlane.com
Your keychain on the Mac can store 
more than just login details, but iOS 
lacks the Keychain Access app to 
handle this extra stuff. Dashlane is a 
ﬂexible password, autoﬁll, and private 
info manager. It’s free for iPad-only 
use, and syncing between devices 
costs $39.99 a year; three-year or 
ﬁve-year plans are also available.

EASY STORAGE
New items can be imported 
from the current clipboard or 
Photos and Files browsers, 
methods that work on the iPad 
as well. There’s also a share

Tough testing, trusted ratings

A re-release of a 
game from 2010, 
with few changes 
other than updates 
for modern versions of iOS, 
poses an interesting question: 
Can such a veteran of the 
App Store still entertain the

The answer is a simple yes.

The game is also not afraid 
to abandon its central gimmick

platforming — levels that 
begin without any ink in the

simplistic than something 
like Scribblenauts, where the 
fun comes from just how well 
the developers have predicted 
your solutions to problems 
 — especially because Max’s 
limited ink means the 
solutions are often stairs, or

The prospect of a better keyboard whose

data, Bobby 2.0 introduces conveniences 
such as iCloud sync between devices, 
passcode and Touch ID support, the 
ability to reorder subscriptions, and 
more ﬂexible payment cycles. Most of 
these require separate in-app purchases 
— including the ability to manage more 
than ﬁve subscriptions — or you can 
unlock everything for $2.99.
Since we already track household bills 
from apps like Chronicle, Bobby didn’t 
seem particularly useful at ﬁrst. But 
Grammarly is attractive and does pick 
up plenty of mistakes but, until tools like 
this can truly infer meaning, use it, and 
other tools like it, with caution.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Although it’s 
often effective, exceptions make us 
reluctant to trust Grammarly’s breezy 
assurances. ALAN STONEBRIDGE
customizable notiﬁcations came in handy 
for autopay subscriptions like Hulu and 
Amazon Prime, services we often forget 
to enter until it’s time to reconcile that 
particular credit card statement.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Never forget a 
sub again — but pay to unlock Bobby ﬁrst 
for the good stuff. J.R. BOOKWALTER

You can approach Just Press 
Record from two angles. On 
the Apple Watch, it’s the 
memos app Apple never 
bothered to make. You prod a big button 
to kick off audio capture (or jump right to 
recording from the app’s complication), 
and press Stop when you’re done. Recent 
recordings remain on your Apple Watch 
for your perusal, and you can revel in 
the fun of using your wrist in a way that 
would have been the envy of characters 
in sci-ﬁ movies a few decades ago.
On the iPhone, the app’s a mite more 
involved, but not to the degree that it’s 
remotely complicated. Apple Watch 
Anyone who uses iPad as 
an alternative to a laptop 
knows that ﬁle management 
is more cumbersome than 
it should be, even with the Files app in 
iOS 11. While many apps can natively 
extract ﬁles from ZIP archives, the ability 
to create compressed archives is rare.
Kpressor is an app for iPhone and 
iPad that does just two things: open ZIP 
archives so you can extract ﬁles for use 
on iPhone or iPad, as well as create 
archives in the ﬁrst place. It’s the latter 
that will most intrigue power users, 
especially those who frequently send 
large ﬁles from their mobile devices.

even Jony Ive would be impressed.
Adding ﬁles to a new or existing ZIP archive 
is a snap with Kpressor.
recordings are squirted across via iCloud 
and then live in the Watch tab, but you 
can also record using your iPhone, by 
way of its own microphone or external 
kit. If you want pro-level recording, you 
can even ramp up the capture quality 
from AAC to 96kHz/24-bit.
Individual recordings can be renamed, 
shared, and played back at various 
speeds. You’ll also notice when ﬁring up 
a recording that Just Press Record will 
have transcribed everything (assuming 
permissions were granted at the 
appropriate time). This means recordings 
are searchable by date and ﬁle name, and 
also by content. Sure, the transcriptions 
There are only two buttons  — 
Create ZIP Archive and Open ZIP Archive 
—  but Kpressor also plays nice with the 
Files app, so you can open from or save 
to other compatible apps, including cloud 
storage providers. Selecting any ﬁle in an 
open archive displays a preview as well.
Kpressor can also be summoned from 
the Share sheet of other apps, which is 
the most convenient way to use it. On the 
iPad, the app supports drag-and-drop in 
tandem with Slide Over and Split View.
It’s not perfect — we had problems 
saving archives to Apollo Cloud or to 
internal device storage, and the app 
strictly works with the ZIP ﬁle format and 
aren’t always accurate, but we’d prefer to 
start with a pretty good ﬁrst attempt we 
can later tidy up on the Mac, rather than 
have to laboriously type out every word 
ourselves. In short, it’s all very useful. 
THE BOTTOM LINE. Quick and 
convenient audio capture, whatever 
your device. CRAIG GRANNELL
none of its variants. Working with cloud 
storage requires some patience as ﬁles 
are sent back and forth. This is a niche 
app, but does a decent job of ﬁlling a 
void in Apple’s own ﬁle management.

no longer second-class citizens on iOS.

Every now and again you 
come across a puzzle that 
bumps right up against the 
maximum your brain can 
manage. Follow.trail, while being initially 
confusing because of its lack of a tutorial 
or any on-screen words, slowly reveals 
itself to be something much, much more.
You play a domino, basically. There are 
tiles before you with different numbers 
of dots and, later on, tiles with special 
symbols on them that mean different 
things. You have to navigate through this 
maze of symbols by moving one tile at a 
time to reduce each tile to zero, and then 
go to the ﬁnish tile. Sound easy? It’s not.
Although best known for 
rigid (but genius) puzzler 
Euclidean Lands, developer 
kunabi brother returns to 
the organic, playful feel found in its 
debut, Blek, with its new app. But instead 
of coaxing living calligraphy through a 
series of mazes, Frost is akin to a Petri 
dish of tiny interactive universes.
The aim is to guide swarms of tiny 
neon creatures to an orb, which gradually 
ﬁlls. Once it’s sated, you move on to the 
next challenge. At ﬁrst, you’re carving 
paths through space, which the little 
critters ﬂit along. But Frost constantly 
shakes up how everything works.

The levels with black and white tiles will make 
your brain melt into a puddle.
Frost emphasizes play and experimentation 
— you must discover how everything works.
The reason there is no tutorial is 
simply that follow.trail wants you to 
discover the rules through trial and 
error, and it provides an Undo and 
Restart button in order to encourage 
experimentation. It’s frustrating to begin 
with, but becomes more enjoyable as you 
learn the language of the game — what 
each symbol means, what it does, and 
how to get to the ﬁnish tile each time. 
It gets especially difﬁcult when you 
ﬁnd the tile that turns all white tiles 
black, because you can create black 
tiles by stepping onto empty space. The 
solution to each level doesn’t even exist 
at the beginning.
The game regularly introduces new 
creatures and barriers. Some swarms 
are repelled by your pathways. Certain 
scenes resemble complex abstract art, 
with living neon strips that explode into 
jerking electric streamers when bisected 
by a cunningly diverted ribbon of color. 
Others demand you ﬁll multiple orbs — 
which you soon realize rapidly drain 
when creatures stop arriving.
The common factor throughout is a 
sense of play. Frost intentionally tells you 
nothing — you must experiment, make 
discoveries, and take advantage of how 
creatures and obstacles interact. It only 
rarely bafﬂes, and hardened gamers 
Follow.trail is certainly not for 
everyone. It’s an exercise in torturing 
your brain. If you’re a spatially- or 
logically-minded person, however, 
you should deﬁnitely give it a try.
THE BOTTOM LINE. An impressive, 
minimalist logic game that will twist 
your mind into a pretzel. KATE GRAY
could probably ﬁnish in a couple of 
hours. But to do so would miss the point, 
because Frost is a tactile, gorgeous app 
to properly savor, rather than blaze 
through without a second thought.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Short, but very 
sweet, Frost is a dazzling touchscreen 
gaming experience. CRAIG GRANNELL

6 great word games 
for your downtime
ROUNDUP
FOUR LETTERS 
Free  Made for iPhone and iPad
You’d have to be in grade school not to 
ﬁgure out that E, P, E, and K can spell 
out KEEP. Or PEEK. Either will do. But 
how about under pressure? Four Letters 
gives you its titular quartet of characters 
to reconﬁgure into a word, over and over 
again. With a timer counting down all the 
while, even the slightest of brain-fades 
or slips of the ﬁnger can prove your 
downfall. Surprisingly tense stuff.
FIGHT LIST 
Free  Made for iPhone and iPad
Think you know a lot of makes of car? 
Go on, name them. Fight List pits you 
against a friend, gives you a topic, and 
then allows you 45 seconds to tap out 
a list as speedily as your thumbs and/
or neurons allow. This is the kind of 
competitive one-upmanship you’d 
get into over a few beers at the bar, 
transplanted on to your phone. Low-ﬁ? 
Yes, but ﬁendishly addictive all the same.
LETTERPAD 
Free  Made for iPhone and iPad
What do you associate with the word 
“bee”? And, more importantly, which of 
those words can you spell out using the 
grid of nine letters you’ve been provided, 
and are your answers the requisite 
length? That’s the gist of Letterpad — 
which can prove tricky when you’ve 
gotten “hive” and “honey,” but “drone” 
stubbornly eludes you. A great little app 
for testing out your creative thinking.
Give your brain and your vocabulary  
a workout with these fun apps
From crosswords and wordsearches 
through to board games, there’s 
something irresistible about a word 
game. Perhaps it’s the feeling that 
you’re giving your brain a workout as 
well as having a good time, or maybe 
it’s the satisfaction you get when you  
achieve your highest score, think of 
a great word, or beat a rival (or better 
still, the computer). Not sure where 
to start? We’ve rounded up the best

LETTERPRESS 
Free  Made for iPhone and iPad
Imagine a hybrid of Boggle and chess. 
That’s Letterpress! You’re aiming for 
control of the board, and using a tile 
in your word takes it. Play a tile your 
opponent has claimed? It’s yours now. 
Want to give it extra protection? Take its 
surroundings. What results is seriously 
tactical play, in which the pleasure comes 
less from spotting clever spellings and 
more from outfoxing your foe.
SCRABBLE 
Free / $7.99 (premium edition)  
Made for iPhone and iPad
This iOS edition takes the “if it’s not 
broken” approach, focusing instead on 
offering a variety of methods of play. 
Whether you want to ﬁght it out against 
randomly matched online opponents, 
improve by picking up hints against the 
computer, or throw a dictionary across 
the room in local “pass and play” mode, 
this is a solid version of the classic game.
BONZA 
Free  Made for iPhone and iPad
Combining the tactile joy of a jigsaw 
puzzle with the word-building challenge 
of a crossword, Bonza presents you 
with a set of interlinked words (with 
each bunch based on a particular theme), 
broken up into several pieces. It’s then 
your job to move these around and 
restore some lexical sense. A gentle, 
undeniably satisfying way to wake 
your brain up for the day ahead.

>>>App Life

Babies and toddlers 
are as fascinated by 
Apple Watch as 
adults, but most 
developers save their 
best kid-oriented 
apps for iPhone and 
iPad. Baby Fidget ﬁlls this gap quite 
nicely, with a simple app that’s as fun 
for the little ones as it is easy to use.
Think of it like a portable stack of 
ﬂashcards: Every time a youngster 
taps on the Watch display, the screen 
changes to a different whimsical 
shape, vibrant color, fun letter, or cute 
creature. Everything has been designed 
to attract and keep the attention of 
your child, and one small purchase 
works on every device in the house.
We often complain about the lack of 
sound on many Watch apps, but this is 
a rare exception. Tap the Mute button 
after launching the app, and you’ll hear 
the same pleasant music box, lullaby 
music playing in an endless loop for as 
long as the kid plays with your Watch.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Fun Watch-
based ﬂashcards entertain, and the 
looping lullaby music is a nice touch.

There are countless 
astrology apps, but 
few have bothered 
to accommodate 
the Apple Watch. 
Daily Horoscope — 
Astrology! has 
recently arrived to right that wrong.
However, something is amiss from 
the start. Although the iPhone app 
displays proper English by default, the 
Watch app doesn’t have the same knack 
for localization. Using the digital crown 
to scroll through available star signs 
displays the Today button as “Avui” 
— which Google Translate detects as 
the correct word in Catalan. Odd, given 
that the developer is based in Turkey.
We also had frequent connectivity 
issues between Watch and iPhone 
(“carregando” — “charging” in Catalan, 
“loading” in Portuguese), sometimes 
even while changing signs. Worse, the 
app got stuck while loading the day’s 
horoscope, and there’s no option to hop 
between days or see monthly or yearly 
predictions as in the iPhone version.
THE BOTTOM LINE. The horoscope 
says “skip it,” unless you want to learn 
Catalan. J.R. BOOKWALTER

Adobe Premiere Elements 2018
Improved video editing app perfect for beginners
$99.99  From Adobe, adobe.com
Features Guided mode, new tools  Needs OS X 10.11 or later, 4GB of RAM
A
dobe Premiere Elements 2018 is 
comparable with Apple’s iMovie. Both 
apps are designed to help entry-level 
editors import, ﬁx, and share their clips as 
slickly-edited projects featuring titles and 
transitions. If you’re new to video editing, 
Premiere Elements 2018 is worth a look 
— its Guided mode will take you through 
basics such as importing clips and trimming 
them in the Timeline. Step-by-step text 
instructions are accompanied by highlights 
around appropriate buttons and panels in 
the workspace, so you can quickly get to 
know where key editing features are located 
and how to use them. This gives Premiere 
Elements 2018 an edge over iMovie, which 
lacks an interactive workspace and workﬂow 
guide for newcomers to editing. The Video 
Story mode helps turn raw footage into a 
short, slick video suitable for sharing via 
social networking sites.  
One thing Premiere Elements 2018 does 
well is provide ways to speed up the editing 
process. Trimming clips to lose the boring 
bits is a common video editing task, so 
the new Smart Trim feature is designed to 
speed up this time-consuming part of your 
workﬂow. Smart Trim analyzes the footage 
for the presence of faces, groups of people, 
or areas that are in focus, for example. You 
can also manually set it to look for properties 
such as action in a clip, so the footage will 
be trimmed to include only those scenes that 
feature activity. Once Smart Trim has found 
appropriate scenes in a longer clip, you can 
ﬁne-tune them using the Timeline’s trim 
handles. Smart Trim is a springboard to help 
you ﬁnd the best bits of your footage more 
quickly, although it can be a bit hit and miss 
in its automated results. 
Candid Moments is another new feature 
that can help you quickly harvest social-
media-friendly assets from a video clip. If 
you’ve ﬁlmed an event such as a kids’ party, 
then you can run the footage through the 
Candid Moments tool to automatically ﬁnd 
frames that you can export as stills to share 
on Twitter, for example. These automated 
features help speed up the editing process, 
so editors can get ﬁnished videos onto 
social media platforms more quickly. 
Overall, Premiere Elements 2018 can 
help beginners cut their video editing teeth 
with the Guided mode, but as they grow in 
experience, they can expand their developing 
skills in the feature-packed Expert mode. 
Unsure whether this is worth $100 to you? 
Put the app to the test with the free trial 
version, and compare it to iMovie.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Great for 
newbs, with ample power for the 
next step up. GEORGE CAIRNS

W
ireless noise-canceling headphones feel 
like the pinnacle of private listening 
technology. In this regard, B&W’s PX 
headphones are a massive success.  
The feature-set covers all the bases of 
a modern pair of headphones. Charging by 
USB-C? Check. A standard, non-proprietary 
3.5mm jack? Check. A complete set of 
physical button controls? Check. A 
respectable 22 hours of battery life? 
Check. Bluetooth aptX HD support? Check. 
Even more impressive is the ability of the 
headphones to understand when you’re using 
them and when you’re not, turning off when 
you remove them from your head. You can 
even pause by lifting just one of the earcups. 
Occasionally the technology can misﬁre. 
There were a couple of moments when we 
paused our music with the headphones still 
on our head, only for it to resume playing 
after a couple of seconds in confusion. But 
these problems were few and far between, 
and it’s possible to change the sensitivity 
of this feature in the PX’s companion app. 
We tried the PX on a subway train 
during rush hour using the default (“Flight”) 
noise cancelation setting, and it performed 
admirably, with a level of cancelation that’s 
up there with the likes of Bose and Sony. 
If you want more control, there are three 
noise-canceling modes to choose from in the 
companion app, each designed to cancel and 
let through certain frequencies. The “City” 
setting is designed to let through trafﬁc 
noise, so you can walk the streets in safety 
while using the headphones. “Ofﬁce” lets 
through the higher frequencies of the human 
voice, so you can hear colleagues talk to you, 
while “Flight” focuses on eliminating the low 
rumble of a plane. 
We love the functionality and noise 
cancelation of the PX, but its sound quality 
doesn’t quite hit the same heights that we’ve 
come to expect. The biggest problem is the 
mids and trebles, which have a fuzziness to 
them that means complex soundstages can 
end up feeling a little squashed. 
Listen to the likes of Radio Protector by 
65daysofstatic and, when the song really 
gets going, the headphones make the sound 
feel messier and noisier than it should be. 
Overall this leads to a loss of detail. 
At the bassier end, the cans fare a great 
deal better. Play Freeze Me by Death from 
Above 1979, and its driving bass line is 
present in spades. It’s tight, punchy, and 
given the space to hold the song together. 
It feels odd to complain about the PX’s 
sound quality, but it’s a sign of just how 
mainstream noise-cancelation technology 
has become that at this price we’re able to 
expect premium sound quality in addition 
to everything else the headphones offer.

to the noise cancelation party, but the wait 
has been worth it. JON PORTER

Lightroom has been popular with pro 
photographers for years. The desktop 
version, now called Lightroom Classic CC, is 
still available, with little changed from the 
previous version (6.5). Alongside it, however, 
is a new, cloud-focused app, which has now 
assumed the name Lightroom CC. Although 
it has many of the core features of the “old” 
Lightroom, it’s been given the “prosumer” 
treatment, with more advanced tools 
removed and more focus on automation.
The biggest change is that Lightroom now 
insists on uploading your originals and edits 
to the cloud, with storage space based on 
your subscription tier. There is an option to 
also store originals locally, but not to ignore 
the cloud. So at best you’re keeping one 
copy locally and one remotely. This is good 
for backup, but those who regularly shoot 
hundreds of gigabytes of raw images are 
going to have to pay to upgrade their storage. 
This change is mostly aimed at letting

they do go beyond the (much 
improved) tools in Apple’s 
Photos app on the Mac, many 
of the more detailed tool

There once was a utility called TapDex, which provided 
convenient access to Mac contacts from anywhere. It was 
great for looking up phone numbers or copying addresses, 
but was sadly abandoned in the transition to macOS.
Thankfully the creators of Fantastical have come up

modest ambitions. Rather than simply display information, 
Fdugkrs#fdq#hglw#hqwulhv/#dvvljq#jurxsv/#dgg#qhz#Ľhogv#ru#
notes — basically anything the macOS Contacts app can do, 
but straight from the menu bar.

THE BOTTOM LINE.#Wklv#lv#wkh#frqwdfwv#dss#Dssoh#vkrxog#
have made all along. J.R. BOOKWALTER
One pretty common complaint about Photoshop 
Elements is that as you advance through its 
guided edits and tools, your ambitions as an editor 
advance too, only to be stymied by its constrained 
set of features. Elements+ claims there are loads 
of features buried within Elements that can be 
freed up with a few lines of code.
Among the beneﬁts is a traditional Curves tool, 
applied as an adjustment layer, a proper Quick 
Mask mode, and a comprehensive selection of 
Smart Object commands — all accessed through 
Elements’ Effects panel. You can create paths 
from selections, text layers, and vector masks, 
addressing a major omission. There is also a 
good set of scripts, including focus stacking.
Navigating the tools takes a little getting used 
to — they don’t sit with Elements’ regular controls 
— but there’s absolutely tons here. Elements+ is 
well worth a look if you object to Creative Cloud 
or simply love Elements too much to leave.
THE BOTTOM LINE. A very worthwhile 
addition to Elements for users who don’t want 
to go to the full Photoshop. DAVE STEVENSON

L
ogoist 3 is a vector drawing app. No, 
don’t run away! It’s an app that tries 
to make vector drawing work for normal 
people. There’s a Bézier curve tool, but you 
can ignore it and build graphics from ready-
made shapes, styles, and effects.
Templates are provided for logos, business 
cards, and greeting cards. A better place to 
start, though, is the app’s Showcase, which 
presents dozens of ﬁnished pieces that you 
can unpick. At the top left of Logoist’s single 
window is a panel showing all the objects and 
groups in the artwork in a tree structure, like 
folders in Finder; clicking on any item in the 
artwork highlights it in the tree, and vice 
versa, with an animated glow so you can’t 
miss it. (The whole interface makes good use 
of animation, but this can be turned off.)
It’s a great way to see how vector drawings 
are constructed, although we’d have liked 
more help in selecting items behind others. 
Effects include glows, transparency, emboss, 
gradients, and “Generators,” textures that 
follow the shape of an object. From scratch, 
it’s easy to click Shape or Clipart in the top 
toolbar, pick from the options, and choose 
from the styles listed on the left. On the 
right, you can customize each effect.
Logoist 3 gets a lot right. It has functions 
like grid snapping (with radial and concentric 
grids), adding and subtracting objects, align/
distribute, and creating instances of an object 
that inherit changes. Features like shadows 
are well handled. Controls are comprehensive, 
yet it all feels more accessible than a pro app 
such as Adobe Illustrator or Afﬁnity Designer.
In the end, though, this is a moving-pretty-
things-around app, not a drawing app. Even 
if you get something looking almost right by 
combining shapes and styles, you can’t edit 
the vector points that make them up to ﬁnish 
the job off. You can export your work as EPS, 
PDF, or SVG, and edit the lines in another app, 
but that kinda misses the point.
New ﬁles are set to a tiny 500x500 pixels 
without asking, and if you click the Canvas 
button and pick a physical size, such as 
Letter, the app calculates the pixel size at 
72dpi, far too low for print (and who designs 
logos just for screen use?). This won’t matter 
if everything is output as vectors, but some 
effects have to be rendered to bitmap — a 
Check Vector Export option warns you which. 
It’s also odd that style dimensions are set in 
pixels, so they don’t scale correctly within 
the app. And despite the app’s name, the 
few logo templates aren’t very usable. This 
is disappointing, but there’s still a lot here 
for those who want cool artwork fast.
THE BOTTOM LINE. Logoist 3 has an 
impressive range of features that go much 
more than skin-deep. ADAM BANKS

There are plenty of smart tracking 
devices on the market to locate lost items 
with the help of your iPhone. However, 
most Bluetooth-connected gadgets make 
the search harder than necessary by only 
emitting audible beeps without the aid 
of any visual reference.

or other objects into something akin to 
a game of Pokémon Go, complete with 
augmented-reality “pixie dust” that helps 
narrow the hunt to a much smaller area. 
Unlike simple trackers, Pixie requires 
two or more teardrop-shaped smart tags 
nqrzq#dv#Sl{lh#Srlqwv#ğ#wkh#Ľuvw#dwwdfkhv#
to your iPhone with the included peel-
and-stick adhesive backing, while the rest 
are placed on objects you want to track.
At $49.99 per pair, Pixie Points are 
about the same size as competing trackers 
(1.9 inches tall and 1.4 inches wide). Even 
at just 0.1 inch thick, they do stick out like 
a sore thumb on the back of your iPhone.
With the arrival of Apple’s ARkit, Pixie 
has reduced the amount of time required

to do a quick panoramic scan of the room, 
which takes just a few seconds. A 3D “X” 
appears on-screen to mark the spot where 
an item is located, along with a path of 
“pixie dust” encircling the area. Once

F
ujiﬁlm’s latest X Series mirrorless camera 
replaces the aging X-E2S. Instead of a 
DSLR-style design, with a raised, central 
viewﬁnder, the X-E3 has a classic rangeﬁnder 
style, like the X-Pro2, but with diminutive 
proportions and streamlined controls.
The spec is not compromised, though. The 
X-E3 features Fujiﬁlm’s 24.3MP X-Trans CMOS 
III APS-C sensor, bettering the 16.3MP sensor 
in the X-E2S. The ISO range increases, with 
a native sensitivity range of ISO200–12,800; 
the expanded range is ISO100–51,200, with 
support for Raw ﬁles as well as JPEG, too.
There’s a 2.36-million-dot OLED electronic 
viewﬁnder with 0.62x magniﬁcation, while 
the rear boasts a three-inch touchscreen 
display with a resolution of over one million 
dots. You can tap the display to focus and 
trigger the shutter, and also swipe through 
and pinch-to-zoom to review images.
There’s Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity, and 
also Bluetooth — pair the camera with your 
device and install the free Camera Remote 
app to transfer images to share easily.  
The X-E3 also offers 4K video capture 
at 30p as well as Full HD at 60p, with both 
formats supporting ﬁlm simulations. There’s 
a 2.5mm jack input for a mic, but not for 
audio monitoring. There’s just one SD card 
slot, and no support for faster UHS-II cards.
The X-E3 has a decent handgrip as big 
as the X-E2S’s, and is comfortable to hold 
one-handed. While not weather-sealed, it has 
a premium feel thanks to magnesium-alloy 
top and bottom plates and machined dials.
With the smaller body, there’s no built-in 
ﬂash; instead, there’s a pocket-sized hotshoe-
mounted ﬂash. The shutter speed dial offers 
settings from 1 to 1/4000 sec plus Bulb, Time, 
and Automatic; the exposure compensation 
dial runs from –3 to +3EV. A new, small rocker 
switch round the shutter speed dial gives the 
option of full Auto mode — ideal for novices. 
The big change, though, is the streamlined 
rear layout. The display extends all the way to 
the left edge, and you can ﬂick right, left, up, 
or down on the touchscreen to access four 
different functions or settings, which can be 
tailored to your preference in the menu. 
The X-E3 uses the same 325-point AF 
system as the X-T20. With ﬁve AF-C presets 
to pick from, AF tracking is much improved. 
Focusing could be a bit faster, but it’s a solid 
performer. While the X-E3 isn’t marketed as 
an action camera, it can shoot at a very fast 
14fps using the electronic shutter, or a more 
restrained 8fps with the mechanical shutter. 
Fujiﬁlm’s TTL 256-zone metering system 
performs very well, although when presented 
with a high-contrast scene it can sometimes 
underexpose the shot. Image quality is some 
of the best available from an APS-C-based 
camera, detail is excellent, and the ﬁlm 
simulation modes are very effective.
At 350 shots per charge, battery life is not 
bad for a mirrorless camera, though a DSLR 
rival like the Nikon D5600 offers 820 shots. 
THE BOTTOM LINE. The X-E3 is a joy to 
shoot with, and is everything you’d want in 
a compact mirrorless camera. PHIL HALL

USB cable to keep everything together.
There are smaller water-resistant drives available, but 
we like the design here: The plug you insert into the drive’s 
USB-C port is built into the bumper’s back edge, so it’s 
unlikely to be pulled out of the drive’s body if the back 
happens to scrape a surface during a plunge, say; on 
some alternatives, the whole panel pulls out.
Speeds are close to other USB 3.1 Gen 2 drives with one

The Koogeek Smart Light Bulb is simple to set up 
and control via iOS. Unlike some smart bulbs, the 
Koogeek doesn’t require any additional hardware.
Getting started is easy thanks to built-in 
networking hardware. To connect the bulb, turn it 
on and snap a photo of the bulb’s HomeKit code 
with the Home app. Just a few seconds later, you 
can be swapping colors and ﬁddling with the 
brightness using an iPhone. Koogeek has an app, 
but it doesn’t offer much additional functionality.
The bulb can create any of 16 million colors, and 
offers plenty of customization for just the right 
shade and brightness. But at 500 lumens, it’s an 
accent light rather than primary light source. 
At $40 a pop, this bulb costs more than other 
smart bulbs that ofﬂoad electronics to a separate 
bridge. If you need only a few, the math or 
convenience factor may work out in your favor —
but more elaborate lighting setups may be more 
practical with a different brand of smart bulb.

competition, but built-in hardware makes setting 
up easier. RAY AGUILERA

BETTER LIVING THROUGH SMARTER TECHNOLOGY

Hit the road, hit the gym — or just stay at

DO GYMS REALLY NEED GYMKIT?
 It might take a while for new GymKit-
compatible equipment to arrive in your local 
gym. However, many exercise machines 
already include Bluetooth connectivity 
or NFC chips, which enable them to 
communicate with the manufacturer’s 
own apps on iOS and Android devices.
WHAT ABOUT FITNESS TRACKERS?
 Apple Watch includes dozens of 
features that have little to do with 
health or ﬁtness. If all you want 
is a basic ﬁtband that can monitor 
speed, distance, and heart rate, 
there are many cheaper 
alternatives. One of our favorites 
is the Misﬁt Ray, which starts 
at just $79.99 and looks like 
a friendship bracelet. It doesn’t 
have a screen, but can use 
Bluetooth to send data to your 
iPhone when you get home.

Cable TV subscribers may prefer 
the chatty newscasters that come 
along with reports from The 
Weather Channel, but if you’re looking for 
location-based forecasts without all the noise, 
NextWeather could be your next weather app.
Featuring beautifully animated backgrounds 
and a wealth of data including hourly, daily, and 
weekly forecasts, this Apple TV app enables you 
to track multiple locations at once, and even 
picks up your current location with a tap on the 
Siri Remote. Don’t want the distraction of an 
animated background? Toggle on High Contrast 
Mode and view weather in a static way against 
a stark black background instead.
Free to download, with no in-app advertising, 
NextWeather is also available on iPhone, iPad, 
or Apple Watch, complete with a “feels like” 
temperature display. Fast, elegant, and with just 
the right amount of detail, this is one weather 
app that’s worth installing. J.R. BOOKWALTER

Without a Search function, trying to ﬁnd the movie you want to watch via

The simple and clean interface of this weather app has

The arrival of 
VUDU delivered 
UltraViolet 
movies and TV shows to Apple

we’re still waiting for Amazon’s 
app, and Google Play remains 
nowhere in sight. This app 
may be a solution. Powered 
by Disney’s KeyChest, Movies 
Anywhere enables you to buy 
movies from iTunes, Amazon, 
VUDU, or Google Play and 
have them show up on all 
four services. Well, almost — 
Hollywood studios Paramount, 
MGM, and Lionsgate, as well 
as smaller independent studios, 
remain ﬁrmly on the sidelines.
The Movies Anywhere app 
offers an easy way for up to 
six family members to watch 
your collection, with parental 
controls. But the Apple TV 
version is a bit basic, with no 
way to sort your library; titles 
are instead listed in the order 
they were added, newest ﬁrst.
Search is also missing, which 
makes ﬁnding movies difﬁcult 
with larger libraries. (Oddly, 
these options exist on iPhone 
and iPad.) But the beauty is 
you can still watch from each 
retailer’s own app — which is 
a good thing since the Movies 
Anywhere app lacks 4K HDR 
support. J.R. BOOKWALTER

Make the most of 
home entertainment
In this game, Aragon is 
the city of the Devil, and 
players must use all of 
their wits and skills to escape from his 
evil clutches. But don’t get the wrong 
idea: Aragon Escaping is a sci-ﬁ themed 
game where you commandeer an 
escape pod and do your best to dodge 
the numerous buildings coming at you.
The 3D graphics are decent, but you 
won’t have much time to enjoy them 
because the gameplay goes fast and 
furious until you smash headﬁrst into 
a building. It’s a game of reﬂexes as you 
slide your thumb back and forth across 
the Siri Remote touchpad, trying to get 
as far as you can without a collision.
As in many games of this type, things 
start to get repetitive pretty quickly. 
But for free, it’s certainly worth a look, 
especially when the iPhone and iPad 
versions also come along for the ride.

When those 3D-animated

download the real thing? Real 
Aquarium features ﬁve different 
species swimming in their native 
environment for your viewing pleasure.
The picture quality is pretty decent, 
but there’s no accompanying sound 
or music. The videos also loop, so the 
app soon wears out its welcome. But 
perhaps Real Aquarium’s biggest 
limitation is the ﬁsh selection.
There are ﬁve species available: 
octopus, scorpionﬁsh, whale shark, 
anemoneﬁsh, and stingray. Although 
those are pretty cool options, only one, 
octopus, is available for full-screen 
viewing. The others must be unlocked 
via in-app purchase of $0.99 each or 
$1.99 for them all. So the content is 
ﬁne but, unless you’re prepared to pay, 
we say pass. J.R. BOOKWALTER

> Making a dual-boot High Sierra system
I want to try out High Sierra and APFS, but not switch completely yet.  
Could I make my iMac dual-boot using an external SSD?
Email Mac|Life at ask@maclife.com
Yes, but here are two problems: 
Sierra can’t read or write High 
Sierra’s APFS ﬁle system reliably, 
and High Sierra does terrible things 
to Sierra’s Time Machine. The latest 
High Sierra installer should do the 
job direct, but consider using a 
bootable USB memory stick to 
ensure everything works well. Use 
DiskMaker X from diskmakerx.com 
or follow Apple’s own instructions 
at bit.ly/bootable_installer.
Restart from that stick, with 
your external SSD connected, run 
Disk Utility from the installer to 
format the SSD as normal APFS, 
then install High Sierra onto it.
Problems begin when you 
restart back into Sierra. Unless 
Apple updates APFS support in 
Sierra, copying ﬁles to or from 
APFS under that system is 
unreliable, and you’ll encounter 
errors. Both versions are fully 
compatible with Mac OS Extended 
volumes, though.
High Sierra can damage hidden 
FSEvents data used by Sierra’s 
Time Machine to establish what to 
back up. At best, this will trigger a 
“deep event scan” at Sierra’s next 
backup; at worst it can force a full 
backup, which swallows space on 
Time Machine’s drive.
Although High 
Sierra’s installer 
app should convert 
an external SSD 
to APFS and then 
install macOS 10.13 
on it, a bootable 
USB memory 
stick is usually 
more reliable.

Quick-fire 
questions 
& answers
WHAT’S THE BEST WAY 
TO BACK UP AN iPAD?
If you can afford the cost 
and bandwidth, iCloud 
is convenient, but more 
expensive than iTunes. 
iTunes is the quickest 
and most reliable method, 
with your iPad connected 
to your Mac over USB, 
and the Mac in turn backed 
up using Time Machine 
or similar.
WILL iOS 11 CHANGE 
MY FILES IN iCLOUD?
No. If you’ve updated 
to iOS 10.3, your devices 
are already using the new 
ﬁle system, APFS, which 
converts ﬁles into iCloud’s 
storage format when it 
moves them into iCloud. 
However, some apps 
such as Notes have new 
features in iOS 11 like tables 
(below), and if you use 
them, you’ll need to use 
iOS 11 to access them fully.
Get ofﬁcial documentation at support.apple.com | Get help with hardware at support.apple.com/repair
Apple’s instructions are at 
bit.ly/leave_familysharing 
and bit.ly/changeregion. You 
must ﬁrst leave the family 
group, even if you’re its 
organizer, although doing so 
will dissolve the group.
Once you’ve done that, 
you should wait for your 
subscriptions to expire. 
Just before that happens, 
download all of your past 
purchases, then change your 
country of residence and 
payment card details.
Of course, this all assumes 
an ordered and planned 
process, which you have 
not been able to undertake. 
Although you can leave 
the family group, you’re 
already unable to download 
past purchases, and the 
change in your card address 
seems to be blocking 
you from changing any of 
the other details for your 
account, in an effort to 
reactivate it.
There doesn’t appear 
to be any way that you can 
circumvent this chain of 
processes now. The only way 
that your account can be put 
back in order is for Apple to 
step in. Keep trying with 
Apple’s iTunes Store support, 
in the hope that someone 
there will escalate your 
problem to a member of 
staff able to rectify this.
> Got lost when moving country
I used to live in Canada, and have recently moved back to the US. My charge card was 
registered to my Canadian address, but has already been changed to my new one in the 
US. With Apple’s Canadian services, I had Apple Music with a family group, which expires 
in three months. Now I can’t change my card details because of that, nor my country of 
residence. In the meantime, I’ve lost access to my music library, can’t make purchases 
from the App Store, and Apple Support can’t help. What should I do?
You can change details for your Apple ID account by tapping the 
top Apple ID item in Settings, but you must stick to Apple’s rules.

Apple’s new ﬁle system in 
High Sierra, because they 
are able to protect just 
sensitive information.
HOW CAN I MAKE 
TIME MACHINE 
BACKUPS QUICKER?
Backing up to a large, fast 
Thunderbolt RAID array 
helps, but simplest is to 
archive existing backups 
and start a new series on a 
freshly formatted backup 
drive. You’ll be amazed 
how slow large and old 
backup collections become. 
What currently takes 
10 minutes should be done 
in less than a minute.
 
 
 
 
 
 
WHY CAN’T 
DISK UTILITY 
FORMAT MY USB 
MEMORY STICK?
Sierra’s Disk Utility often 
returns an error the ﬁrst 
time you try to format 
drives like memory sticks, 
but usually works properly 
when you repeat the 
action. In High Sierra, try 
unmounting the stick ﬁrst, 
then select its grayed-out 
entry at the left and re-
partition it to the 
desired format.
Both Sierra and High Sierra alter the timing 
used to connect to Bluetooth devices during 
the startup process. This may result from EFI 
ﬁrmware updates, which are applied during 
the upgrade, and the delay is also set in 
NVRAM, although you shouldn’t attempt 
to change it there.
Check that your Mac is running an 
appropriately recent version of its EFI 
ﬁrmware. You can ﬁnd this out by clicking 
About This Mac in the Apple menu, and then 
clicking the System Report button. In the 
Hardware Overview, the ﬁrmware version is 
given as the Boot ROM Version, of which the 
last two groups of hex digits give the version. 
Yours should read at least 0118 B42 in Sierra, 
or 0123 B00 after an upgrade to High Sierra. 
A full list is available at bit.ly/eﬁ_ﬁrmware.
FileVault’s disk encryption won’t help 
your iMac’s speed, particularly if the 
encrypted startup disk isn’t an SSD. It’s 
worth thinking carefully about whether you 
need the whole disk to be securely encrypted, 
or whether it would be better just to protect 
its most sensitive ﬁles. When High Sierra 
is mature enough, you might ﬁnd that its 
encrypted volume support is both quicker 
and more appropriate for you. If you don’t 
need whole disk encryption, now is a good 
time to get rid of it.
> Slow to start with FileVault enabled
Since I upgraded my iMac Late 2013 to Sierra, it takes a long time to recognize my Magic 
Mouse after startup, and the wireless keyboard is even slower to get going. It doesn’t run 
any old software, but I did convert it to FileVault just before upgrading. Is this just Sierra?

ARE HIGH SIERRA’S 
ENCRYPTED VOLUMES 
REALLY SECURE?
Yes, although there was 
a bug in Disk Utility which 
revealed the password 
instead of its hint! That 
bug was ﬁxed in the 
Supplemental Update in 
early October, and APFS-
encrypted disks and 
volumes created since 
then appear to be secure.
THE MACBOOK PRO’S 
STARTUP CHIME 
HAS VANISHED
All 2016 MacBook Pro 
models shipped with 
muted startup chimes. 
This was controlled by 
a setting in NVRAM, 
and many users changed 
this to restore the chime. 
However, recent ﬁrmware 
updates for High Sierra 
have disabled the chime 
altogether. It sounds like 
it’s gone for good.
HOW FAR BACK IN TIME 
DO SIERRA’S LOGS GO?
At ﬁrst, they went back 
only a few days, but 
around macOS 10.12.4 
that was extended to 
20 days or so. Since log 
ﬁles stored in /var/db 
are normally backed up 
by Time Machine, your 
system could have a 
complete log record 
dating back to when 
you upgraded to Sierra.
Macs don’t have default 
passwords. Enter your login 
password when prompted 
at startup, ensuring that 
Caps Lock is not engaged 
and stepping through each 
character carefully. 
You can reset your 
password in macOS 
Recovery (hold Cmd+R 
when starting up). Select 
Disk Utility, then open 
Terminal in Utilities. At its 
prompt, type resetpassword 
and press Return. Select 
your startup volume, then 
your normal user account 
when prompted. After 
entering your new password, 
click Save, and restart your 
Mac. You should now be able 
to log into your account 
using that new password.
This gives you an empty 
local keychain. Since you’re 
using iCloud Keychain, open 
iCloud’s preferences pane, 
and ensure that feature is 
on, to give access to all your 
saved passwords. If you can’t 
access iCloud properly, you 
may also need to change 
your Apple ID’s password 
— follow Apple’s instructions 
at bit.ly/appleid_password. 
You should then have two 
main passwords: one to log 
into your MacBook Air, and 
one for your Apple ID to 
access iCloud and other 
Apple services.
> What’s the default password?
After upgrading to Sierra, my MacBook Air has started asking for and refusing a password 
when it starts up, although I use iCloud Keychain. Is there a default password?
Yes, but keep backups in case you need 
access in the future. If you’re not using iCloud 
Keychain, these are stored locally in your 
login keychain, which opens automatically 
when you log in. Never tamper with the 
System or System Roots keychains. 
In addition to your regular Time Machine 
or similar backup, make a copy on an external 
drive of your current login keychain from ~/
Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db, put 
this somewhere safe, then open Keychain 
Access. Ensure that login is selected in the 
upper left list of keychains. It’s clearer to 
work separately with passwords, any secure 
notes, certiﬁcates, and keys. To delete an 
item, select it in the main listing and then 
choose Edit > Delete, or Ctrl-click and use the 
contextual menu command Delete “n” (which 
names each item). It’s safe to delete expired 
certiﬁcates (those with icons marked with a 
red cross), and any passwords that haven’t 
been modiﬁed for a long time.
If you make a mistake you can’t undo, 
make a copy of your backup login keychain 
using a different name, and copy it to your ~/
Library/Keychains folder. Open it, using your 
login password, then copy and paste missing 
items into your current login keychain. Don’t 
worry if your keychain seems large — they 
work ﬁne with over 1,000 items.
> Tidying your keychain
I recently noticed that my keychain holds many passwords, most of which I don’t need. 
Can I delete them, and if so, how?
To sync your Mac with your shared keychain and all its passwords 
and certiﬁcates, turn on Keychain in the iCloud pane.

So long as you use a copy of your Entourage 
mailboxes, the repair utility you mention may 
ﬁx your immediate issue. If you’ve already 
tried to get Entourage itself to repair the 
mailboxes and it has been unable to, that’s 
your only serious option.
Microsoft Outlook is quite different, 
and there’s no other mail client which is an 
obvious replacement for Entourage’s rich 
features. Many users were dismayed when it 
was replaced with the cut-down Outlook.
There’s a wide choice of mail client apps 
available in the App Store; visit their makers’ 
websites for demo versions and further 
information about each. Many are also 
offered outside the store, making them 
much easier to try before buying.
For converting your current mailboxes, try 
Emailchemy from weirdkid.com/emailchemy, 
which supports the conversion of database,  
.RGE and cache ﬁles to formats that can be 
imported into almost any other mail client.
The longer you postpone making the move 
to a new client, the greater the chances of 
Entourage failing and leaving your mailboxes 
completely unreadable.
This can occur when you convert old 
iPhotos libraries, when another app has 
tampered with the library, or because of 
bugs, but it’s most common when you use 
Copy and Paste to add new images to the 
library, instead of importing them.
Ensure you have a backup of the library, 
so if anything goes wrong you can revert to 
it. Remove images with garbled names, and 
import them from the originals to preserve 
names and other information.
If that isn’t feasible, edit the information 
about each image to add names and other 
details. If neither of these strategies works, 
suspect a problem in that library, and repair 
it. Hold the Opt and Cmd keys when opening 
the Photos app, and accept the offer to 
repair the current library.
> Garbled names in Photos
Some image names in Photos are gibberish. How should I ﬁx them?
HOW CAN I CHECK 
WHAT’S IN AN 
INSTALLER PACKAGE?
When you open a package 
in Installer, File > List Files 
can normally display its 
contents. To ﬁnd out more, 
use Suspicious Package 
(Free, mothersruin.com), 
which gives full details of 
the package’s contents, its 
installer scripts, and more. 
It also works as a Quick 
Look plugin — to view the 
package, tap the spacebar.
HOW CAN I PUT A 
DIALOG FRONT END 
ONTO A SHELL SCRIPT?
AppleScript has support 
for simple dialogs, or try 
Swift in Xcode, which can 
do almost anything but has 
a steep learning curve. A 
quick, simple way is 
Pashua (Free, bluem.net/
en/mac/pashua), which 
can provide a fairly 
sophisticated front end for 
most scripting languages.
> Moving on from Entourage
We’ve been using Microsoft Entourage 2008 as our email client on our iMac Late 2015 
with Sierra. Entourage, however, seems to be dying. We’ve looked at Outlook 2016, which 
lacks a lot of valuable features, so we don’t want to upgrade to it. Should we use Stellar 
Phoenix Entourage Repair and carry on using the app, or is there something better?
When images in Photos have garbled 
names or info, correct them using the 
Info option and check it works properly.
Before you commit to a new mail client, download a demo of Emailchemy and test migrating your mailboxes.

Ask yourself whether you really need them, 
or would ﬁnd a less invasive alternative 
browser like Firefox to be just as suitable. 
If you can get rid of the other browsers, that 
should free up your Mac’s processor and 
memory capacity.
To remove Opera, you should need only to 
drag the app from Applications to the Trash. 
Chrome, however, is a bit more complicated. 
Quit the app, and drag it to the Trash. 
Then, in Finder, hold Opt and choose Go > 
Library, then open the Application Support 
folder within that location. Move the folder 
named Chrome from the Google folder to 
the Trash. Then restart, and empty the Trash. 
Doing this should clear all related detritus, 
although there may still be smaller ﬁles left 
in your user account’s library. Do a ﬁnal 
check in Activity Monitor to ensure there are 
no processes still running for the trashed 
apps. If there are, you might need to hunt 
those down and remove them too.
Modern browsers are hefty and complex. 
Although it’s often wise to keep one running, 
keeping a second open in addition is likely to 
adversely affect your Mac’s performance.
> Browser helpers hogging the CPU
I currently have Opera and Google Chrome installed as Safari alternatives. According to 
Activity Monitor, their “helpers” are hogging the CPU. Is this normal and necessary?
HOW CAN I TELL WHICH APPS WORK 
IN HIGH SIERRA?
There’s no simple test to tell whether older 
apps will still work in High Sierra. Check each 
vendor’s support pages to see which version 
they deem compatible; upgrade if necessary.
HOW DO I CREATE DVD-VIDEO DISCS 
WITH DATA TOO?
This is basically a regular DVD-Video disc 
with added data ﬁles stored in a different

app such as Toast Titanium from roxio.com.

HOW TO Use selections and masks in Photoshop
Path to success
There’s more than one way to skin this 
particular cat, but we’ll start with the Pen tool, 
which pros favor for sharp cutouts. We traced 
around our furry subject — the path doesn’t 
need to be perfect, just a general outline.
Convert to selection
In the Path window, Ctrl-click your path 
and choose Make Selection. Keep Anti-aliased 
checked, but make sure the feather radius is 
set to zero. Click OK and the familiar marching 
ants marquee appears where your path was.
 
GENIUS TIP
Take your time! 
Photoshop’s automatic 
tools are no substitute for 
attention to detail and 
making sure you get 
things absolutely right. 
Questionable cutouts are 
visible a mile away.
IN PHOTOGRAPHY, ISOLATED 
subjects, alone on a sea of 
white paper, are a favorite way 
to showcase products or the 
latest fashions, and can look spectacular. 
The easiest way to achieve this is to shoot 
your subjects in a studio environment, 
against a clean, white backdrop — this 
gives you the smallest amount of work 
to do afterwards.
However, that’s often easier said 
than done. Some subjects are too large to 
accommodate even in a big studio, others 
too restless. Or you might simply have 
photographed something in the outside 
world and want to remove a distracting 
or otherwise inappropriate background. 
So, while capturing your subjects against 
plain backdrops is the ideal situation, it’s 
not always achievable, which is where 
Photoshop can come to the rescue.
Photoshop’s options for cutting 
subjects out of their background are 
constantly evolving, from simple marquee 
selections years ago to the advanced 
edge-detection technology available now, 
which can help you achieve impressive 
results with indistinct edges such as hair 
or fur, and even semi-transparent areas 
such as smoke and clouds. The best 
approach is to use both old-school and 
new-fangled techniques hand in hand, 
which Photoshop’s Select and Mask tools 
allow you to do. DAVE STEVENSON

Select and Mask
Press Cmd+Opt+R to open the Select 
and Mask workspace. The ﬁrst slider in the 
panel is Transparency. Drag this to the right to 
preview how your cutout looks. Right now it’s 
pretty rough and ready, with no ﬁne fur detail.
So reﬁned
Press R to select the Reﬁne Edge tool, 
tap the left or right square bracket key to get 
the brush a good size to work with, and paint 
around the outline. Photoshop will detect the 
ﬁne edge detail and add it to the selection.
 
JARGON BUSTER
In Photoshop, a mask is 
effectively a hole in a 
layer that allows you to 
see the layers beneath. 
It’s useful here because 
it doesn’t throw the rest 
of your layer away once 
you’ve cut your subject 
out, leaving you room 
for maneuver later.
QUICK LOOK Better selections and cutouts
QUICK SELECTION
The Quick Selection Tool 
(W) is a fast way to begin, 
especially for objects with 
distinct outlines and good 
contrast from the setting.
PREVIEW OPTIONS
There’s a range of ways 
to preview your selection. 
Try more than one to see 
which suits your image 
best and check your work.
EXPERT OPTIONS
There are numerous 
options for smoothing and 
feathering the edges of a 
cutout, decontaminating 
colors, and much more.
REFINE EDGE
The Refine Edge tool 
is the star of the show. 
Simply brush over areas 
to fine-tune the cutout. 
Find out more in step 4.
PAN AROUND
In Select and Mask panel, 
just as in other parts of 
Photoshop, you can zoom 
in or out, and pan around 
using the Hand Tool (H).

Going manual
Here, Reﬁne Edge has failed us and left 
a bit of our infant monkey’s head transparent. 
Fix things like this manually — press B to switch 
to the Selection Brush, then paint the selection 
area back in. Again, a soft brush works best.
Fine-tune and export
Use progressively smaller brushes to 
reﬁne your work, then decide how you want to 
export the cutout in Output Settings. Selection 
(marching ants) is the most basic; a new layer 
with a layer mask is the most ﬂexible.
Paint away
Here’s the Reﬁne Edge tool at work — 
as we painted around the monkey’s previously 
roughly cut head, Photoshop has automatically 
detected and added tons of fur detail. Work 
around the rest of the outline of your image.
Check your work
Press K to view an outline of the 
selection on a plain black background. You 
should see plenty of ﬁne detail and no hard 
edges. If you see any of the latter, go back over 
the area with the Reﬁne Edge brush to ﬁx it.
Smear attack
The top of our monkey’s head has a 
“halo” of the old background around it, which 
will look like a smear. Select the Brush tool (B), 
hold Opt so your brush will remove areas from 
the selection, and paint out all the smears.
Corrections
Using a soft brush, work in small areas, 
and check the results before moving on. Step 
back by pressing Cmd+Opt+Z, and redo strokes 
with Cmd+Shift+Z. Zoom in (press Cmd and +) 
and vary brush size to get ﬁne detail right. 
 
REFINE MASKS 
MANUALLY
If you’ve saved your 
selection as a new layer 
with a mask, remember 
that you can retouch the 
mask manually at any 
time. Opt-click the mask 
thumbnail in the Layers 
panel to edit it directly in 
the main image window.
 
GENIUS TIP
Here’s a pro trick: use 
adjustment layers to 
temporarily increase the 
contrast in the image or 
apply any other changes 
that make it easier to 
create the selection you 
need. When finished, 
simply remove the 
adjustment layers.

Launchpad
Launchpad works like an 
iPhone’s Home screen. Click its icon in 
the Dock or use Spotlight to open its 
icon grid, then click the app you want. 
You can drag icons to rearrange them 
across multiple pages and in folders.
Use Finder
To open apps in Finder, simply 
click the Finder icon in the Dock (it’s 
always there, on the left), then click 
Applications in the sidebar — if this is 
hidden, go to Finder > Preferences > 
Sidebar — and double-click an app icon.
Ask Siri
Click Siri’s icon in the Dock or 
menu bar and enable Ask Siri. Now 
click either icon again or hold down 
Cmd+space to open Siri and try saying 
commands, such as “Launch Mail.” You 
can disable Siri in System Preferences.
Make a service
Open Automator and create a 
new Service document. Change the 
“Service receives” item to “no input.” 
Drag Launch Application from the left 
to the right pane. Select your app in 
the pop-up, and press Cmd+S to save.
Apps in the Dock
The Dock provides single-click 
access to your favorite apps. To tell 
your Mac to keep an app there, Ctrl-
click the app’s icon and pick Options > 
Keep in Dock. You can drag any app’s 
icon from Finder straight into the Dock.
Open With
Double-clicking a ﬁle opens the 
app set as default for that type of ﬁle — 
to set this, Ctrl-click it, select Get Info,  
pick an app under Open with, and click 
Change All. To open a ﬁle in a different 
app, Ctrl-click and use Open With.
Use aliases
For fast access to an app, create 
a shortcut to it. Hold Opt+Cmd and 
drag the app icon to your desktop or a 
folder; the arrow on the pointer shows 
it will create an alias when you let go. 
To open the app, double-click the alias.
Assign a key combo
Name your Service, and press 
Cmd+C to copy the name. Go to System 
Preferences > Keyboards > Shortcuts > 
App Shortcuts. Click +, paste the name, 
click the shortcut box, and press your 
desired key combo. Finally, click Save.
Use Spotlight
You can use Spotlight to search 
for apps wherever they are on your 
Mac and open them. Press Cmd+space 
to reveal its search bar, then type an 
app’s name. Use the arrow keys to 
select the app; press Return to open it.

Enable “On My Device”
Your iOS device is not included as a 
Location in the Files app right away. So in any 
app (say Photos), pick a ﬁle, tap its Share icon, 
and swipe to the left in the bottom row of 
options until you see Save to Files, then tap it.
Save a ﬁle to enable
Next tap “On My iPhone/iPad.” You can 
save only into your existing Pages, Numbers, 
and Keynote folders, so pick any of these and 
tap Add. Now when you open the Files app, 
your device appears in the list of Locations.
WHEN THE NEW Files app was 
announced, it sounded like an 
iOS equivalent of the macOS 
Finder, enabling you to view

are not all visible in Files unless you add 
them to the app; you can’t even see your 
device among the default Locations until

Once you start using it, though, the app 
does give you a convenient central point

add subfolders, not top-
level folders, so next tap a 
folder. Drag the screen 
down slightly and tap the 
“New Folder” icon at top 
left (the folder with a plus 
sign on it — if you don’t 
see this or it’s grayed out, 
the cloud service you’ve 
chosen doesn’t support

Add other services
Install other cloud storage apps and 
set them up, then open Files and tap Edit (top-
right of the main Browse screen). Activate (or 
hide) the Locations you want, and change their 
order by dragging them up or down the list.
Recents and Favorites
Files you’ve accessed in Files get added 
automatically to Recents, so you can access 
them again super-quick. For fast access to 
folders, add them to Favorites — tap and hold 
on a folder, and select Favorite in the pop-up.
Collaborate with others
With a Pages, Numbers, or Keynote ﬁle 
in your iCloud Drive, you can also invite other 
people to work on it with you. At the foot of 
the Share sheet, tap Add People, pick how to 
send invites, then tap Share Options below.
Using tags
To duplicate, rename, move, delete, or 
share a ﬁle, tap and hold on it and pick the task 
you want in the pop-up. Select Tags to apply a 
tag (or several), then ﬁnd ﬁles with a given tag 
fast by tapping the tag on the Browse screen.
Share ﬁles
Tap and hold on a ﬁle and select Share, 
or alternatively tap Select (top-right), tap a ﬁle 
or multiple ﬁles to select them, then hit the 
Share icon at bottom-left. You can share in all 
the usual ways — AirDrop, Message, and more.
Set access levels
Set who can access the ﬁle and what 
they can do. With the settings shown, invitees 
who sign in can all see everyone’s changes in 
real time, color-coded so you know who’s done 
what. Learn more at bit.ly/iwork_collaborate.
 
DELETE AND 
RECOVER
Deleting a file or folder 
in Files doesn’t trash it at 
once, just move it (and in 
the case of a folder, all its 
contents and subfolders) 
into the Recently Deleted 
folder. It will be deleted 
for good after 30 days 
(sooner in the case of 
some cloud services), but 
if you change your mind 
in the meantime, you can 
tap and hold on it and 
select Recover.
 
ADD, MOVE, COPY
You can add more files 
to a folder using Save to 
Files (see step 1) or using 
drag-and-drop on an iPad. 
To move files elsewhere 
in Files, drag-and-drop on 
iPad, or tap-and-hold and 
select Move. Note, though: 
If a file is on your device 
and you want to move it 
to iCloud, selecting Move 
will not move it but copy 
it. If you’re sure you don’t 
need the original anymore, 
you can then delete it 
yourself, leaving the copy.

SUBS NOT 
SHOWING?
If you find that subs you 
expected to see — Netflix, 
for example — are not 
listed, it’s most likely 
because you didn’t sign up 
using iTunes or an app. 
In this case, you’ll have 
to log in to the company’s 
website to view and 
manage your subscription.
CANCEL SUB
If a Cancel option is available, 
clicking it will be bringing your 
current subscription to an end. 
PAYMENT TIERS
You may decide you want to 
keep your existing membership 
but move to a different tier of 
payment. If this is the case, 
then you can usually select 
a different option here.
NOTE THE DATE
The display will tell you the date 
on which your actions will take 
effect. Change the payment tier, 
for example, and the new tier will 
come into effect after that day. 
Cancel and you’ll be able to 
access your sub until that day.
VIEW SUBSCRIPTION
Details of your current terms 
are at the top of the Settings 
page for each subscription or

HOW TO Manage existing subscriptions
 
View Apple ID
A pop-up pane will now appear, giving 
you some options associated with your Apple 
ID. Select “View Apple ID” at the top and you’ll 
be asked to sign in, using either your password 
or Touch ID (or Face ID on iPhone X).
Check your subs
You can now view all your subscriptions 
— active ones are listed ﬁrst, followed by any 
that have expired. It is possible to resubscribe 
to lapsed subscriptions as well as terminate 
those you no longer want.
Go to Subscriptions
The next page will display information 
associated with your Apple ID. To view your 
subscriptions and memberships, scroll down 
and tap Subscriptions. (If this does not appear, 
you don’t have any active subscriptions!)
 
Select a sub
Tap one of the subscriptions in your 
list to view its current terms and any available 
payment tier options. Tap Cancel to bring it to 
an end (usually on its renewal date, rather than 
immediately). It will then appear under Expired.
 
ON YOUR MAC
To view your subscriptions 
on your Mac, open iTunes, 
sign in with your Apple ID, 
and go to Account > View 
My Account. You can then 
manage your subscriptions 
within Settings.
Open Settings app
In order to view your subscriptions and 
make amendments to them, you ﬁrst need to 
go to the Settings app and tap your name, at 
the very top of the page. This will take you to 
your Apple ID settings page.
 
Select App Store
Tap the entry for iTunes & App Store 
— you’ll ﬁnd it in the second group of options. 
On the next page, you need to tap your Apple 
ID. Make sure it is the ID associated with the 
subscriptions that you want to manage.
 
GENIUS TIP
If you change your 
mind after canceling 
a subscription, find it 
in the Expired section, 
tap it, and reactivate it 
by selecting a payment 
option on the screen.

A safety check
Before you construct your 
email, take a look at your selected 
contacts and check whether any of 
them has no email address. Add the 
“Find Contacts” action; you can use it 
to ﬁlter out inappropriate contacts.
Start with a subject
Type “ask” in the search bar 
(top left), and drag “Ask for Input” 
from the results into the pane on the 
right. Set the question to “What’s your 
message’s subject?” Leave the answer 
empty, and set the input type to Text.
Get the addresses
Note the line between actions, 
from Select Contact all the way into 
the Repeat loop: Each time the Repeat 
loop begins, it will take a new contact 
from those it receives. Add “Get Email 
Addresses from Input” to the loop.
Filter contacts
A line shows this gets contacts 
from the last action. Tap Add Filter, 
then tap Group and pick Email Address, 
change “is” to “contains,” and replace 
“anything” with “@.” People with no 
email address will be discarded for now.
Set the body
Add a second “Ask for input” 
action below the ﬁrst. Set its question 
to “What is its body (without greeting/
sign-off)?” and the answer and input 
type as before. It’s correct that no data 
is passed down to this action.
Multiple addresses
The items now at your disposal 
are email addresses belonging to the 
contact being dealt with. If the contact 
has several, you want to choose which 
to use. Add the “Count” action within 
the loop, and set it to count items.
Check for multiples
Add an “If” action next in line. 
This adds three bars: If, Otherwise, and 
End If. In the ﬁrst, set the condition to 
check if the received number is greater 
than 1. If so, you’ll need to perform an 
extra action to offer a choice.
Repeat action
Next, add a “Repeat with Each” 
action. Between the two bars this adds 
to the workﬂow, you’ll use several 
actions to send the same overall 
message, yet personalized, repeating 
until all contacts have been sent one.
Select pic & people 
Find and add a “Select Photos” 
action at the bottom of the workﬂow. 
Our example allows attachment of 
one image. Find and add the “Select 
Contact” action and set it to allow 
multiple people to be selected.

Check input & output
Tap the If action’s title and you’ll 
see that it passes forward its input — the 
quantity of email addresses. You need 
the actual email addresses — use a Magic 
Variable: Add the “Get Variable” action, 
and tap Choose Variable.
Personalized prompt
It may not be obvious exactly who 
an email address belongs to, so let’s 
tailor the prompt with the name of the 
person being emailed on this pass 
through the Repeat loop. Tap the Repeat 
Item token in the keyboard’s top row.
Use a Magic Variable 
Next, tap Magic Variable. All of the 
actions in the workﬂow will spread out 
a little, with pill-shaped tokens between 
them. Find “Get Email Addresses from 
Input” in the workﬂow, and tap the token 
labeled Email Addresses just below it.
What’s substituted?
After you insert the token into the 
prompt, it’ll be selected and a contextual 
panel will appear at the bottom of the 
screen. That panel should indicate that 
the contact’s full name will be used in 
the token’s place when the action runs.
Choose an address 
To list those addresses so you can 
choose one, add the “Choose from List” 
action. Ensure Select Multiple is off, then 
set the action’s prompt to “Use which 
address for ?” and place the insertion 
point right before the questionmark.
With one address 
If the contact has only one email 
address, the workﬂow will proceed along 
the If action’s Otherwise branch instead. 
In that branch, we need only to retrieve 
that address, so add a “Get Variable” 
action just below the Otherwise bar.
> MAGIC VARIABLES EXPLAINED
An easy way to retrieve an earlier action’s output
Magic Variables enables you to refer back to earlier actions’ results. This can also 
be done using Set Variable and Get Variable actions to store and retrieve results, 
but Magic Variables reduces the number of explicit actions in a workﬂow, helping 
to make things easier to understand. Tap where you need to use a result, then tap 
the magic wand icon above the keyboard. Tokens representing actions’ results 
appear between the actions; tap one to use its result at the insertion point. Tap 
the token in that place and a panel at the bottom of the screen will open, showing 
what info from the retrieved result will be used — you’ll see an example soon. You’ll 
also ﬁnd a Rename option above the keyboard for assigning a meaningful name, 
and Reveal Action to check where the result is from. When done, tap Go Back.
>>>Create
94   FEB 2018  maclife.com

Retrieve the address
Tap Choose Variable in the action 
and choose Repeat Item; it’ll appear as a 
token within the action. Tap that token to 
be presented with a list of info that can 
be retrieved from the item (a contact). 
Choose “Email address,” then tap Done.
Add prewritten body
Remove “Two” from the second 
row to serve as a blank line in our email. 
Add a third row and set its contents to 
a Magic Variable containing the second 
“Ask for Input” action’s result. Rename 
the variable “msgBody” for clarity.
Check your work 
Check that you have two actions 
(“Get Variable” and “Choose from List”) 
between If and Otherwise, and only “Get 
Variable” between Otherwise and End If. 
The result that will be passed forward 
now will always be a single email address. 
Sign off your email
Add another blank item, then add 
two more for “Kind regards,” and your 
name, for example. Add one last item 
to the list: make it a Magic Variable that 
takes the output of the Select Photos 
action, and rename that “Photo.”

Add Send Email next. Let it show 
its Compose sheet until you’ve tested the 
workﬂow. In the “To” row, add a Magic 
Variable for the result below “End If”; call 
it “msgRecip”. In Subject, add the very 
ﬁrst action’s result; call it “msgSubject.”
Start composing 
We have all the info we need for 
our email. Below the End If bar, add a 
List action. Replace its ﬁrst item with

Gain certainty about recipients
It would be useful if your workﬂow conﬁrmed whether it was unable to send an 
email to any of your chosen contacts. Below the End Repeat bar, add a “Get 
Variable” action and set it to get the results of “Select Contact.” Next, add “Find 
Contacts” and set its ﬁlter to look for contacts whose email address doesn’t 
contain @. Add a “Count” action and set it to count items (email addresses).
We’ll do different things based on that number. Add an If action and set it to 
“Is Greater Than” and “0.” Under the If bar, add Show Alert with the title “Unable 
to send to…”, a Magic Variable in its body for Find Contacts’ result, and disable its 
Cancel button. After Otherwise, add Show Alert, title it “Success!” and give it a 
suitable message. Now ask friends if you may test all of this using their addresses.

YOUR APPLE WATCH stores 
personal data, so it makes 
sense to be careful about 
keeping both the Watch and 
the information on it as safe as you can. 
Make sure you use a passcode and set up a 
way to track your Watch if you do happen 
to mislay it. There are also some other 
settings you should pay attention to, such

Make your Apple Watch more secure
Prevent prying eyes from gaining access to info on your Watch
In addition, the Watch and your 
iPhone sync your data, meaning you 
need to consider the privacy on your 
phone too. Since there is always a danger 
that someone could use your Watch to 
buy something with Apple Pay without 
your phone nearby, Watch security is 
something you should take very seriously. 
Luckily, protecting your Watch and your 
data doesn’t take long. DAVID CROOKES

10 minutes
UNLOCK WITH iPHONE
For greater convenience, you 
could have your Watch unlock 
whenever you unlock your iPhone. 
If this is something you’d like, 
then just slide this to green.
LONGER PASSCODE
You can use a passcode longer 
than four digits, but in order to 
do this, you have to unlock the 
Watch with your iPhone and input 
the code on there.
SET A LIMIT
Think about it: if someone stole 
your Watch, they could try 10,000 
times to crack those four digits. 
Slide this option to green and 
your Watch will erase all of its 
data after 10 failed attempts.
CHANGE YOUR 
PASSCODE
There’s always a chance someone 
can look over your shoulder as 
you tap in your passcode, so 
it’s worthwhile changing your 
passcode every so often.

HOW TO Review your Apple Watch’s security
Turn off Fitness data
Privacy settings can be adjusted to 
stop your Watch sharing your motion and 
ﬁtness data. To do this, open the Watch app 
on your iPhone, then tap My Watch > Privacy 
and select “Motion & Fitness.”
Check Activation Lock
Protect your Watch against theft by 
ensuring the Activation Lock is on. Tap “My 
Watch,” select your watch name at the top of 
the screen and tap “i.” If you can see “Find My 
Apple Watch,” the Lock is activated.
Move the sliders
Within “Motion & Fitness” you’ll see 
two options — one that allows the Watch to 
monitor your heart rate and another that 
determines your step and ﬁtness levels. You 
can turn both of these off.
 
Disable the Watch
If those words don’t appear, see our 
sidebar for how to set up Find My iPhone. Log 
in when prompted, and you can locate your 
Watch on a map, play a sound to help you 
ﬁnd it, remotely erase it, or enter Lost Mode.
 
MORE PRIVATE 
NOTIFICATIONS
By default, your Watch will 
show short notifications — 
the name of the app and 
alert type or sender name 
— but if you keep your arm 
raised, these expand to 
display the contents of 
the message or email. To 
keep things more private, 
open the Apple Watch app 
on your iPhone, tap 
Notifications, and move 
the Notification Privacy 
switch to on. Now when 
you receive a notification 
on your Watch, it won’t 
expand; tap it to reply, 
dismiss, or view in the 
originating app.
 
Check your privacy
Since your Watch will share the health 
settings, location services, contacts, and 
analytics collected by your iPhone, ﬁrst make 
sure you lock all these down. Open Settings 
on your iPhone and tap Privacy.
Alter the settings
You can turn Location Services off 
and see which apps request access to your 
contacts and health data. Under Analytics, you 
can turn off “Share iPhone & Watch Analytics.” 
There’s also a “Share iCloud Analytics” option.
 
SET UP  
FIND MY iPHONE
If your Watch does not 
have the Activation Lock 
activated, then you need 
to set up Find My iPhone. 
To do this, go to Settings 
on your iPhone, tap your 
name at the top of the 
screen, select iCloud and 
scroll down to Find My 
iPhone. Tap it, make sure 
the slider next to the 
feature is green, then 
enter your Apple ID. 
Your iPhone, Watch, and 
AirPods will be set up.

IN THE SPRING of 1983, Steve Jobs 
decided his pet project at Apple — the 
Macintosh — needed a big launch, and 
talked CEO John Sculley into funding 
a pitch from ad agency Chiat\Day for an 
epic ad themed on George Orwell’s 1984. 
British director Ridley Scott — fresh from 
Blade Runner — signed a $600,000 two-
picture deal to produce spots for both 
the Macintosh and the Lisa; the latter 
was directed by Scott’s colleague Adrian 
Lyne (Flashdance, Fatal Attraction) and 
featured a young Kevin Costner (pre-
Untouchables) as a yuppie Apple user. 
The Macintosh spot was less literal: 
hiring a huge studio in Shepperton, 
near London, and dressing it with 
scrap jet engine parts, Scott conjured 
a dystopian scene in which model and 
athlete Anya Major hurled a hammer 
to shatter the screen from which Big 
Brother was addressing an oppressed 
proletariat (Scott recruited local 
skinheads as extras for the scene). It was 
meant to represent fear of technology, 
but when Jobs previewed the ad at a 
Hawaii sales meeting he suggested Big 
Brother was computer giant IBM.
The staff loved it, but Apple’s board, 
led by Mike Markkula, didn’t get it at all, 
and tried to force Chiat\Day to sell back 
the airtime they’d booked, for hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, 
during January’s Super 
Bowl. But it was too late, 
and the ad ran. Sculley 
committed millions more 
to a newspaper ad blitz 
explaining what the 
Macintosh actually was. 
“I remember feeling 
this was a huge project 
for one airing,” ﬁlm editor 
Pamela Power told me in 2014. A regular 
collaborator with Scott, she cut the 
one-minute spot, shot on 35mm, using 
traditional analog equipment; the Mac 
would later help to revolutionize her job. 
Although it ran only once nationally, the 
ad had been aired on local stations to 
qualify for the 1983 ad awards season. 
It won numerous trophies, including Best 
Super Bowl Spot in 2007, and is widely 
rated the best TV ad of all time.
