 NEW thiNgs to do  amaziNg WEbsitEs  fasciNatiNg facts
chip flaws Meltdown and spectre directly affect 
a huge range of processors made in the last 20 
years, including mobile cpUs from aRM.

  |  February 2018

The Knowledge…
The first Windows laptops to be powered by 
Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, typically 
found in smartphones, have started to 
emerge from hardware development labs, 
and they look impressive – not for their 
power (which is lacking a little) but for their 
portability, endurance, and the convenience 
of having 4G connectivity on board. Both HP 
and Lenovo will have announced their own 
machines by the time you read this; here’s a 
look at Asus’ NovaGo...
How to beat the Spectre 
and Meltdown bugs
Make your PC more secure
A trio of security flaws discovered in the 
last year have rocked the technology 
world with their extent and scope, with 
billions of devices – from PCs to web 
servers, tablets to smartphones – 
potentially affected.
The flaws – Spectre Variant 1, Spectre 
Variant 2, and Meltdown – were found 
by a number of people including a 
member of Google’s Project Zero, and 
have been present in chip designs for 
over 20 years, with 
CPUs from AMD, 
ARM, IBM and Intel 
directly affected. 
The news has 
been described by 
some security experts as ‘catastrophic’ 
since hackers could use the flaws to 
access passwords, encryption keys and 
personal data, although no such 
exploits have been found in the wild.
patches incoming
There’s no need to panic yet, though. 
Although Spectre and Meltdown are 
hardware rather than software flaws, 
device manufacturers have been 
working with CPU makers such as AMD 
and Intel to find workarounds, mainly 
in the form of software patches.
Microsoft has already issued a 
security update for Windows 10, as well 
as previous versions of the operating 
system. Windows 10 should download 
the update automatically, but to be 
sure, type ‘windows update’ in the 
search bar of the Taskbar, and select 
‘Check for updates.’ 
Download and 
install any new 
updates it finds.
Of the CPU flaws, 
Spectre poses both 
the biggest risk, and is also the hardest 
to exploit. Ultimately, the only way to 
fix it may be to redesign the affected 
processors, although this should mean 
that future CPUs are immune from 
Spectre and Meltdown going forward.
Until then, the best way to stay safe is 
to make sure your PC – and any other 
devices you own – have the latest OS 
and security updates installed. 
Fundamental flaws in the way processors work expose 
billions of devices worldwide – luckily there’s an easy fix
IKEA Trådfri
i don’t need any more DiY furniture
Ah, yes, we completely understand. But 
this is something different: it’s Ikea’s first 
foray into the world of smart lighting. The 
Trådfri range consists of a whole bunch of 
bulbs and associated trinkets, and it’s 
priced competitively with the likes of 
Philips’ Hue. It’s also dead easy to get 
started with.
how easy?
You don’t even need to assemble a 
complex smart lighting setup; you can 
pick up a white LED bulb and a wireless 
dimmer for around £15. Pair the two 
together, and you’ve moved your light 
switch from your wall to your hand – and 
you have a dimmer, something which is an 
increasing rarity with modern bulbs.
what else can i do?
If you want to take your Trådfri setup 
further, you can add Ikea’s Trådfri Gateway 
to your router. This talks to all the bulbs in 
your house, and gives you full control of 
them all from an app on your phone. 
There’s also a ten-device remote control 
available, which makes the process of 
managing your lights super-simple.
any colours?
You’re not left out if you’re looking for a 
more luminous experience – there’s an 
RGB strand of the Trådfri on offer, and you 
can get full control of the colouration via 
the app. Zigbee integration means you 
can also, after a fashion, combine Ikea 
lights with Hue bulbs.
Zigbee? what’s that?
It’s a combined standard method of 
communication for smart home devices. 
All being well, if manufacturers adopt it, 
Zigbee will mean the smart home of 
tomorrow can be controlled by one app 
rather than a massive collection of them. 
But that does rather depend on everyone 
playing nice – Ikea has only recently added 
Zigbee support, so it’s certainly something 
that can be tacked on after the fact.
BetteR BatteRY the NovaGo can last for up to 22 
hours on a single charge, and 30 days on standby.
weiGht issUes asus’ effort isn’t the lightest at 
1.4kg, but future laptops should get much lighter.

snapdragon laptops will be convertible tablets.

Apple is in hot water. After discussion 
by iPhone users on Reddit, and a 
deeper investigation by Geekbench 
developer John Moore, the company 
was found to be deliberately slowing 
down devices with older batteries, 
often dropping them to less than half 
the speed of units with fresh batteries.
Ostensibly this was a move to 
improve stability; the software update 
that introduced the change was 
designed to stop random phone 
shutdowns. Apple, 
when discovered, 
admitted the 
practice and offered 
owners cut-price 
battery upgrades. 
Nonetheless, it’s 
fired up a debate. 
Should companies 
be allowed to 
forcibly slow older 
hardware, even if it’s 
for ultimately benevolent reasons?
The answer isn’t clear, given how 
hard deliberate slowdown is to prove, 
but Apple’s tactics have been seen as 
underhanded by some, including the 
members of multiple international class 
action lawsuits and criminal action filed 
by Halte à l’Obsolescence Programmée 
(Stop Planned Obsolescence) in France. 
The latter group is leaning on a 2015 
French law that makes it illegal to 
“deliberately reduce the lifespan of a 
product to increase the rate of 
replacement”. This is, technically, the 
opposite of what’s happening – Apple 
appears to be attempting to increase 
the lifespan of older phones – but 
credit to the group for trying, at least.
The notion of planned obsolescence 
has been around for a while, and it’s 
not hard to see why. Older machines, 
with newer operating systems or 
software, tend to 
run more slowly. In 
most cases, this isn’t 
an Apple-style 
slowdown. It’s 
down to more 
advanced software 
–  programmed in a 
less efficient 
manner – not 
finding the power it 
needs to perform. 
That’s something no lawsuit is going to 
fix, although the increase in legal 
wrangling may make gadget makers 
– particularly those who also produce 
the software for their devices – think 
twice about the impact their updates 
will have on older devices, or be 
transparent about slowdowns. Maybe 
the end result will be that your next 
phone or laptop will last a lot longer…
Everyone thought the idea of planned obsolescence was 
a myth, but it’s much closer to the truth...

Clover
en.ejie.me
Last issue we looked at the forthcoming 
Windows Sets feature, which groups your 
Windows into switchable tabs. If you just 
can’t wait for that to arrive – and, 
realistically, nobody’s sure when it’s going 
to land – then Clover is an interesting 
alternative. It doesn’t do everything Sets 
does, but it does add tabs to your File 
Explorer windows, meaning much less 
clutter when managing your files. 
The installer interface is in Chinese (just 
hit the large button in the middle of the 
installer Window to set it off) but the rest 
is in English; once it’s ensconced in your 
machine, you’ll get Google Chrome-style 
tab management, including a bookmarks 
bar, dockable (and undockable) tabs, and 
the ability to click any folder with the 
middle button of your mouse to open a 
new tab there immediately. Once you’ve 
started using it, you’ll never want to stop.
Over like ClOver Tabs make file 
management an absolute breeze.

The hottest new Windows hardware on the horizon
Incoming
Intel’s Next Unit of Computing (NUC) has always been about showcasing the 
chip giant’s next generation technologies, and the NUC 8 Enthusiast barebones, 
small form factor PC is no exception.
Revealed at CES 2018, the NUC 8 Enthusiast comes with an eighth generation 
Intel Core i7 CPU, plus an AMD Radeon RX Vega M discrete graphics card – 
something that’s surprising given the intense rivalry between Intel and AMD.
Measuring just 221x142x39mm, the NUC 8 Enthuasist is clearly ideal for 
stowing in the living room (it even offers a VESA wall mount) and is capable of 
handling both 4K graphics and Virtual Reality (VR) – all you need to do is add 
your own storage and RAM. There are two models available: an overclockable 
NUC8i7HVK and a non-overclockable NUC8i7HNK, both of which will go on sale 
this spring. Pricing has yet to be confirmed.

hen it comes to 
outright speed, your 
PC never seems to 
have enough of it. 
Or to put it another 
way, it doesn’t 
matter how smoothly it’s running, 
your PC could always do with being 
that bit faster. Armed with the right 
know-how, you can fine-tune your 
PC to squeeze more performance 
from it, but the effort involved can 
be more than it’s worth.
Which is where we come in. In this 
feature we’ve dug out 20 of the 
finest free tools we know that can 
help speed up your PC. We’ll open 
by revealing lightweight alternatives 
to the bloated apps you’ve been 
using, and then we’ll move on to 
reveal our favourite tools for 
fine-tuning your system. Your 
hardware could use some 
optimisation too, so we’ve collected 
the best overclocking and tuning 
apps for pushing it beyond its limits. 
And finally, when you next bite the 
bullet and reinstall Windows, we 
reveal five tools that can help 
safeguard and speed up the process 
before running you through the 
steps you need to take to restore 
Windows to its pristine, like-new 
form, unencumbered by bloated 
apps and collected detritus.
Your computer is ready to take its

1
Multiple layers
Multi-layered images enable 
you to lay parts of one image on top of 
another for all kinds of creative effects. 
Paint.NET has full support for layers, 
with a transparency slider and choice 
of methods for blending one layer into 
another for the perfect image.
2
Powerful filters
Want to do something artistic 
with your photos? Paint.NET has built-in 
filters that offer a range of artistic 
effects, including rendering your photos 
in pencil, ink or oil paints. Other filters 
produce blurs, sharpen and distortion 
effects just like Photoshop.
ne of the downsides of 
the rapidly evolving 
computer market is that 
specifications have 
improved so fast that 
application makers have 
rarely felt the need to streamline their 
programs. Why spend time cutting back 
the fat when next year’s PC will likely be 
twice as fast anyway?
That’s fine if you’ve just bought a 
shiny new PC, but most of us like to 
keep our machines running for several 
years. Or perhaps you bought an entry 
level laptop or 2-in-1 device only to find 
1GB RAM doesn’t go half as far as it used 
to. Before you know it, opening Office or 
running your image editor seems to sap 
your PC of its strength, leaving it 
sluggish and barely responsive.
In this first section, we’ve identified 
five key apps that can bring Windows to 
its knees and dug out lightweight 
alternatives. Throw away Office, 
Photoshop and your bloated security 
tool and try these alternatives instead. 
They all make fewer demands on your 
PC’s RAM and are engineered to work 
efficiently and smoothly, even on older 
and lower-powered machines.
WPS Office Free
Available from www.wps.com/office-
free, this productivity suite is the perfect 
lightweight alternative to Microsoft 
Office. The free version replaces Word, 
Excel and PowerPoint and in addition to 
preserving the Office ribbon has some 
neat tricks of its own, such as multiple 
document tabs, enabling you to easily 
switch between two or more 
documents. There’s seven-day version 
history for all the files that you create 
with it, enabling you to roll back easily. 
Plus there’s a drag-and-drop tool for 
adjusting the layout of individual 
paragraphs in your documents.
Crucially WPS Office Free has a small 
footprint too, consuming noticeably less 
memory than Microsoft Office, and 
there’s even a PDF to Word tool that can 
convert documents of up to five pages. 
The free version is ad-supported, but 
they’re not too intrusive.
Paint.NET (www.getpaint.net) 
sits beautifully in the middle 
between Photoshop (too 
powerful and bloated) and 
Paint (too basic), offering the 
best features of the former 
without bringing your PC 
grinding to a halt. 
In addition to the standard 
editing, compositing and 
colour-correction tools you’d 
expect, Paint.net also includes 
some powerful and useful 
options too. 
For more fantastic – and free 
– Photoshop alternatives, turn

3D Rotate/Zoom
Want to recompose your image? 
Select Layers > ‘Rotate/Zoom…’. You’ll 
find sliders for zooming, panning and 
rotating your picture in both 2D and 
pseudo 3D. Tick ‘Preserve background’ 
to try and fill in the backdrop when 
‘rolling’ in 3D.
2
Plug-in support
Paint.NET also includes support 
for hundreds of specially designed 
plug-ins – visit www.getpaint.net/doc/
latest/InstallPlugins.html for details. 
These add extra filters and tools, such as 
Photoshop file support and a Shadow/
Highlights recovery tool.
Bitdefender Antivirus
If your PC is creaking under the 
demands of your bloated security 
package, or you’re looking to protect a 
low-powered device like your Windows-
powered 2-in-1 tablet, then Bitdefender 
Antivirus (www.bitdefender.co.uk/
solutions/free.html) has your back. 
Better still, its lightweight interface and 
minimal demands don’t come at the 
expense of protection – it regularly 
scores highly at AV-TEST.
SumatraPDF
Looking for the lightest, fastest way to 
view PDF files outside your web 
browser? Sumatra PDF (www.
sumatrapdfreader.org) takes up just 
5MB of RAM and can read several 
eBook formats – including ePUB and 
the Kindle-friendly MOBI – too.
It’s lacking in features – you can’t 
create PDFs from other files, for 
example – but because it’s available in 
portable form, it’s worth adding to 
your toolkit so when you want to read, 
search or print a PDF or other eBook 
file, you can save time and use this. 
Should you need more features, install 
Foxit Reader (www.foxitsoftware.com/
pdf-reader/) – in fact, why not run both 
side-by-side with SumatraPDF your 
default reader, using Foxit only when 
you need features such as creating 
PDFs from other documents?
MPC-HC
One area where your computer can be 
brought grinding to a halt is when you 
fire up your media player. MPC-HC 
(https://mpc-hc.org/) isn’t just a 
lightweight media player capable of 
playing a wide range of video formats, 
it can play DVDs and some Blu-rays 
too. It’s not short on features either: a 
Favourites menu enables you to create 
shortcuts to frequently watched films; 
you can apply various filters to improve 
playback quality; and it supports 
subtitles. It even supports video 
capture devices, so you can stream 
digital TV from a compatible tuner.
While you can play music through 
MPC-HC, we recommend the similarly 
lightweight and easy-to-use MusicBee 
(https://getmusicbee.com/).

Tune up your system
Discover how to streamline your PC for an extra burst of speed 
with the help of these powerful – and free – apps
1
Time your start
The first thing BootRacer does 
is measure your start time from the 
moment your PC is switched on until 
your start-up apps finish loading. This 
helps you identify bottlenecks at 
different points of the process, so you 
can target your troubleshooting.
2
Delayed start
BootRacer also inserts a delay of 
ten seconds to the start-up process to 
give Windows a chance to finishing 
loading before any start-up programs 
are launched. This helps stop your PC 
from being overwhelmed by demands 
for system resources.
indows has been 
designed for maximum 
compatibility, which 
means that while it’ll run 
on a wide range of PCs, 
it’s not been particularly 
optimised for any of them. This is where 
the selection of apps in this part of the 
feature come into play. They give you 
the tools required to speed up your PC 
in several different ways. As is usually 
the case with apps, less is more – there’s 
no point recommending 100 apps 
whose combined demands outweigh 
the benefits of using them in the first 
place, which is why we’ve pared this 
down to five apps.
You’ll find our favourite tool for 
managing startup, enabling you to both 
monitor and improve the way Windows 
loads. If you’re frequently blighted by 
lockups, then Process Lasso will keep 
those runaway programs in check. 
There’s also a safe tool for tweaking 
low-level Services to free up more 
system resources, JetBoost for 
temporarily halting unnecessary 
processes when running games or other 
demanding applications, and a handy 
defrag tool to build on Windows’ own.
Process Lasso
If your machine frequently appears to 
stop responding or grinds to a halt 
momentarily, then the culprit is usually a 
program or system process that’s 
making excessive demands on your 
system to the detriment of the dozens of 
other running programs and processes, 
including Windows itself.
This problem is particularly acute on 
older or lower-powered PCs with 2GB of 
RAM or less where there’s less memory 
to go around. Process Lasso (https://
bitsum.com/) is designed to monitor 
your PC’s processes – when it detects 
one making runaway demands, it reins it 
in by temporarily lowering its priority to 
ensure your PC keeps running smoothly. 
The free version includes all the core 
functionality, or upgrade for more 
features: a lifetime single user licence for 
the Pro version costs £27. Home Pro 
(£34.88) covers every PC in your home.
Bootracer (www.greatis.com/
bootracer/) has become our 
go-to app for managing 
startup. Not only does it enable 
you to see which programs are 
launching with Windows, it 
times everything too, enabling 
you to keep an eye on the boot 
process and giving you a heads 
up should some resource-
sapping program suddenly 
insert itself into the start-up 
process. Here’s a quick 
rundown of its key features.

Staggered loading
Furthermore, BootRacer also 
loads programs in sequence, one after 
the other – again to balance the 
demands on your PC. Click the three-line 
‘hamburger’ button to reveal a list of all 
the programs that are loading, along 
with their respective start-up times.
2
Monitor and 
manage apps
Click ‘Startup Control’ from the main 
program to manage start-up programs. 
You can disable or delete them from 
here, and rearrange their running order 
– for example, to get fast-loading 
programs launched first.
JetBoost
JetBoost (www.bluesprig.com/jetboost.
html) is a tool that quickly shuts down 
unnecessary services and programs on 
a temporary basis only. For example, if 
you play demanding games or encode 
HD video, JetBoost can deliver a speed 
boost for the duration, then restore 
everything for normal operation after 
– all via its one-click button. Also handy 
for silencing intrusive apps and 
notifications while you work.
Services are special low-level programs 
that run in the background performing 
numerous functions. Each one uses its 
share of system resources and – armed 
with the right know-how – you can 
selectively disable them to free up 
memory and processor time. But why 
do it by hand when Easy Service 
Optimizer (www.sordum.org/8637/) 
can do the hard work for you?
The program provides three presets: 
Safe, Tweaked and Extreme. For most 
people, Safe is best – it’s a ‘no-risk’ 
option and you can easily revert to 
Default if things stop working as they 
should. Advanced users can go further, 
and the app enables you to manually 
tweak individual Services too.
Defraggler
If you’re still running Windows off a 
traditional platter-based hard drive, 
then keeping it defragged is a must. 
Windows’ own Disk Defragmenter 
does a good enough job, particularly 
in Windows 10, but if you want to 
squeeze even more performance out 
of your drive, then Defraggler (www.
piriform.com) is the tool to turn to. Not 
only can you opt to move large files to 
the end of the drive to help speed up 
performance, Defraggler enables you 
to defrag individual files and folders 
too – perfect for quickly defragging a 
single file without tying up your PC for 
hours. Defraggler also offers an 
Optimise option for SSDs, which 
manually wipes space marked for 
deletion to boost drive performance.

Overclock your PC
Push your PC’s components to their limits and deliver noticeable 
speed improvements with these hardware-tuning apps
1
Overclocking  
made easy
Your overclocking options with Intel’s 
utility vary according to the processor 
you have – some will be incredibly 
limited, others will offer more scope. If 
supported, the utility will also enable 
you to overclock the onboard graphics.
2
Test your overclock
After tweaking your settings 
(visit http://bit.ly/pcgoclock for a 
detailed guide courtesy of PC Gamer), 
select Stress Test to perform a five-
minute stress test across processor, 
memory and/or graphics depending 
on what you overclock.
hile there’s no substitute 
for hardware upgrades 
to deliver the ultimate 
performance fillip, the 
fact remains it’s likely 
that various components 
in your PC aren’t being pushed to their 
absolute limits. By default, many 
components are configured in a 
conservative fashion, but armed with 
the right tools you can start squeezing 
them that little bit further.
It’s worth noting that overclocking 
– the process for speeding up your 
processor, RAM and graphics – will 
ultimately shorten the lifespan of these 
components, particularly if their core 
temperature rises. Thankfully, our 
recommended tools have built-in 
fail-safes and monitoring mechanisms 
so you can check that your tweaks aren’t 
going to bring your PC to its knees.
You’ll also find out how to speed up 
other hardware areas too – this time 
without introducing undue stress. 
Expect to deliver minor speed bumps 
to your solid-state drives (SSDs) and 
Internet connection – also make sure 
you update your drivers to ensure the 
latest, fastest ones are in place.
This free tool, which you can download 
from www.pointstone.com/products/
InternetAccelerator, will work best on 
older machines running Windows 7 or 
earlier. It’s designed to make it easy to 
tweak various Windows settings 
relating to your network connection, 
which can have a positive effect on 
various Internet-related activities. 
Internet Accelerator 2 won’t 
physically increase the speed of your 
connection, but it will optimise your 
settings to make full use of the 
available bandwidth. It ensures your 
downloads, web browsing and so on 
are going as fast as they’re able to. 
To use it, select your setup type 
(home or small office LAN for most), 
then click ‘Accelerate!’ to see if you 
can speed things up. 
One way you can speed things 
up is by overclocking your 
processor so both it and your 
RAM run faster than they were 
designed to. There are dangers 
with this approach – 
overheating can shorten your 
components’ lives – but official 
tools help to minimise the 
danger. AMD users should 
install AMD Overdrive (www.
amd.com/overdrive); Intel users 
should download and install 
the Extreme Tuning Utility 
(http://bit.ly/extrtunutil).

3
Benchmark it
Select ‘Benchmarking’ to run a 
quick series of benchmarks to see the 
effects of your overclocking – 
benchmark before you start, and 
perform three benchmarks at a time, 
taking an average to give you a more 
accurate result.
2
App-Profile Pairing
Click ‘Save’ under Advanced 
Tuning to create a profile of your 
overclocked settings. Pair this profile 
with a specific app under App-Profile 
Pairing, so your PC is only overclocked 
when needed – for example, when 
playing games or HD video editing.
Motherboard tools
If you self-built your PC, or know its 
motherboard make and model (find it 
with CPU-Z at www.cpuid.com), visit the 
manufacturer’s website where you may 
find alternative tools for tuning or 
overclocking your system. Examples 
include A-Tuning (ASRock), AI Suite 3 
(Asus) and OC Genie (MSI). You’ll also 
find the latest drivers here too, some of 
which may also help to improve your 
PC’s performance.
MSI Afterburner
Overclocking your graphics card won’t 
turn it into the latest model, but it can 
improve performance to make barely 
playable games run that bit more 
smoothly. If your PC comes with an AMD 
or NVIDIA graphics chip, then MSI 
Afterburner (www.msi.com/page/
afterburner) has your back.
It works by enabling you to tweak 
your chip’s clock frequency and voltage 
while also giving you control over any 
onboard fans to help to try and 
minimise the temperature increase. 
Better still, there are real-time monitors 
to show you the effects of your 
overclock too. Remember – you risk 
damaging your graphics card by 
overclocking, so use with care (if at all).
Is your SSD drive running to its 
maximum? Make sure to visit your 
drive manufacturer to download and 
install any software tools. These alert 
you to health issues, provide firmware 
updates, and may offer settings to 
tweak performance. For example, 
Samsung Magician (http://bit.
ly/2CUTUt7) offers a Rapid Mode 
switch as well as Over Provisioning, 
which reserves free space on your SSD 
to further aid performance and 
lengthen its lifespan.
Similar tools can be found for OCZ 
(http://bit.ly/2DnDgU4), SanDisk 
(http://bit.ly/2CT9Fk3) and Crucial 
(http://bit.ly/2CQDlym) among others.

Reinstall tools
Ensure your next Windows reinstall goes without a hitch 
with the help of these essential tools and utilities
1
Sort rescue media
Launch Macrium Reflect Free 
and choose Other Tasks > Create Rescue 
Media to create a bootable DVD or USB 
flash drive you can use to recover your 
Windows installation should something 
go catastrophically wrong with your PC.
2
Back up partitions
Once done, click the ‘Create an 
image of the partition(s) required to 
backup and restore Windows’ button – 
Macrium will automatically select your 
Windows partition along with any boot 
partitions required to boot your PC.
hen you next come to 
reinstall Windows, it 
pays to take precautions 
before you begin in the 
form of various backups 
– File History is essential 
for your personal data, but what about 
your program settings and how about a 
fail-safe backup in the event of a 
botched reinstall or forgotten file? 
The reinstall process is also a good 
excuse to make changes to the way you 
organise data on your PC’s main internal 
and external drives, while you’ll also 
want to make sure that you have the 
latest versions of the Windows 
installation files to save you a lengthy 
post-install update process.
All these potential problems are 
covered by our favourite reinstall tools. 
You’ll find the best drive backup tool in 
the business rubs shoulders with our 
favourite free partition editor and the 
Windows Media Creation Tool, which 
ensures you have the latest version of 
Windows 8.1 or 10 on your PC. 
Throw in a couple of other handy 
applications and your next Windows 
reinstall just got a whole lot simpler 
(never mind safer).
Reinstalling Windows from 
scratch is a one-way process. 
Once you’ve formatted the 
drive and reinstalled Windows 
everything you once had is 
gone. What happens if you 
forget a key file or setting, or 
the reinstall process goes 
wrong and you want to roll 
things back? Don’t worry, 
Macrium Reflect Free (www.
macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx) 
is just the tool for you – here’s 
how you can use it to protect 
yourself and your PC files.
Take a backup with 
Macrium Reflect Free
The days of relying on an increasingly 
out-of-date installation disc are long 
gone. Simply download the Windows 
Media Creation Tool for Windows 8.1 
(www.microsoft.com/software-
download/windows8) or Windows 10 
(www.microsoft.com/software-
download/windows10) and it will walk 
you through the process of creating 
your reinstall media, either on DVD or 
a USB flash drive. 
Better still, the Windows Media 
Creation Tool will also download the 
latest installation files first – which 
means if you reinstall Windows 10, for 
example, you’ll get it with the Fall 
Creators Update already applied.
Always create fresh media prior to 
reinstalling Windows to ensure you 
have the latest version.

Choose a location
Click the ellipsis (…) next to 
Folder under Destination to select a 
suitable folder on your backup drive. 
Click ‘Advanced Options’ and tick ‘Verify 
image…’ under Auto Verify Image, 
before clicking OK followed by Next.
2
Check and backup
Ignore the Schedules screen 
– this is a one-time fail-safe backup prior 
to reinstallation. Click ‘Next’, review the 
backup settings and click Finish. Untick 
‘Save backup…’ and click OK for Macrium 
to back up and verify the image.
Partition Assistant
AOMEI’s Partition Assistant Standard 
(www.aomeitech.com/aomei-partition-
assistant.html) enables you to divide up 
your PC’s storage drive into two or more 
partitions. Why partition your drive? 
Doing so enables you to separate your 
personal data – documents, photos and 
so on – from Windows and your apps. 
When you next come to reinstall 
Windows, your files are already safely 
stored on another drive.
One of the most time-consuming tasks 
after reinstalling Windows is restoring 
program settings. CloneApp (www.
mirinsoft.com) allows you to selectively 
backup key directories and Registry 
settings where apps store their 
preferences. Nearly 250 program and 
Windows settings are plugged into the 
program – just locate your app, tick the 
box and it’ll back everything up, but 
you can also add your own custom files 
and Registry entries too.
Once Windows and your apps have 
been reinstalled, just launch CloneApp 
and click Restore to put everything 
back again. To selectively restore 
program settings, open the CloneApp\
Backup directory and remove any 
settings you want to exclude before 
running CloneApp.
NTLite
Advanced users may feel frustrated at 
constantly having to tweak Windows 
after installation. NTLite makes it 
possible to build customised Windows 
7, 8.1 or 10 installation media that not 
only has all the latest updates included 
(a boon for Windows 7 users), but 
which is tailored to your needs: you 
can integrate specific driver packages, 
remove unwanted Windows 
components (with built-in safety 
mechanisms to protect you from 
inadvertently removing stuff you might 
need) and perform various tweaks.
Certain features are restricted in the 
free edition – purchase the full version 
for €40 (£36) and you can even 
perform these tweaks to your current 
Windows installation, for example.

A full, destructive reinstall
If you’re looking to wipe the slate clean, or need to recover from major 
issues, the nuclear option is always the best one
einstalling Windows 
from scratch – namely, 
wiping your system drive 
completely clean to 
install a brand, spanking 
new (and fresh) version 
of Windows on to it – is the ultimate 
choice for anyone looking to revive a 
slow-running PC or resolve a major, 
non-hardware issue, such as those 
caused by malware or a clogged up 
computer, In this final section we’ll step 
you through the entire process.
Ideally you should have a recent and 
full backup of your PC, created using 
either File History or the Windows 
Backup and Restore tool before you 
begin, that way you’ll lose the minimum 
of content. A full reinstall really is 
destructive – nothing left on your C 
drive will exist once you’ve finished. You 
should ensure you have the latest 
installation media for your target 
version of Windows – see our section on 
the Windows Media Creation Tool on 
page 18 for tips on how to do this. This 
will ensure a cleaner, more up-to-date 
installation from the off, thus saving you 
time bringing it fully up to date once the 
installation has completed. 
It’s also worth sourcing networking 
and graphics drivers now rather than 
relying on Windows to provide them for 
you – in most cases, they should be built 
in, but not always. Consult your PC or 
motherboard manufacturer’s website for 
these, or visit your Wi-Fi adaptor or 
graphics card manufacturer’s site – 
download them to your backup drive.
Other things to consider: uninstall any 
products that require activation now – 
this should deactivate the licences and 
enable you to use them with your new 
install without any issues. Also, be sure 
to have product keys and program 
installers to hand.
STARTinG ThE  
REinSTAll PROCESS
A full destructive reinstall should always 
be started by booting from your 
installation media, be it a DVD or USB 
flash drive. The actual reinstall process 
doesn’t differ much across Windows 7, 
8.1 or 10. You’ll be asked to verify your 
language, location and keyboard are set 
Restore programs, settings and data
Once Windows has been 
reinstalled, open Windows 
Update to bring Windows fully 
up to date – don’t be surprised 
if there are hundreds of 
updates still to apply in the 
case of Windows 7 and 8.1. 
Once it’s fully up to date, 
consider reinstalling Macrium 
Reflect Free (see page 18) and 
taking your first drive image 
– a vanilla backup you can 
restore in future instead of 
reinstalling Windows itself.
If you followed the advice on 
page 19, you should now be 
able to reinstall your core apps 
using CloneApp from your PC’s 
data drive. If you click the 
Restore button, every single 
program setting you backed 
up will be restored – if there 
are any backup settings you 
don’t want to restore, select 
Options to locate the backup 
folder, then open it and move 
any program folders you want 
to ignore out of the folder 
temporarily before clicking the 
Restore button. Once that’s 
done, take your second 
Macrium Reflect Free backup.
Finally, open File History or 
the Windows Backup and 
Restore tool and take steps to 
restore any data you backed 
up, then make sure that either 
tool is configured to carry on 
backing up all your precious 
files going forward.
Windows 10 users can launch a repair install directly from the Media Creation Tool.
Windows 7 and 8.1 
users will find a 
large number of 
updates waiting 
to be installed 
after reinstalling.

1
Reboot for media
If you’re running Windows 7, or 
have Fast Boot disabled, insert your boot 
media and start your PC. Look for a ‘Press 
any key to boot from CD or DVD’ option  
– even if you have booted from a USB 
flash drive. Press any key on your 
keyboard and you should find that the 
Windows install process starts.
2
Tweak boot options
If you boot back into Windows, 
restart your PC again, but this time press a 
key, such as [F11], when prompted to 
open a boot menu. Once you have done 
so, select your boot media – choosing 
UEFI if that option appears – to boot; 
otherwise, enter setup so that you can 
change the boot device order.
3
Windows 8.1/10
If Fast Boot is enabled on your 
computer, open Settings in Windows and 
then navigate to ‘Update & recovery’ > 
Recovery, then click ‘Restart now’ under 
‘Advanced start-up’. When the boot 
options appear, choose ‘Use a device’ to 
select the USB flash drive or DVD you  
created from the list that appears.
correctly, then it’s a case of clicking 
Install Now. If prompted, enter your 
product key or click Skip if you’re 
running Windows 10 on a PC you 
upgraded during the free period. When 
asked what type of installation you wish 
to perform, choose the Custom option.
Next comes potentially the trickiest 
part of the process. A list of drives and 
partitions will appear – you need to 
select the one Windows is currently 
installed on. By default, it should be 
detected and selected, but verify it’s 
correct before clicking Format (click the 
advanced Drive Options button if it’s 
not visible). Click ‘OK’, then once 
formatted, verify the drive is still 
selected and click Next.
That’s the technical stuff pretty much 
done. You’ll see a checklist of tasks to be 
performed – just sit back and wait. One 
thing to note: when Windows reboots, 
you may see the ‘press any key’ prompt 
again to boot from CD or DVD. Don’t 
press anything if that happens, just let 
the installer continue.
SET uP POST-inSTAll
The post-setup prompt begins with 
Windows 7 users being prompted for 
their product key, then it’s a case of 
setting up a user account and you’re off 
and running. Windows 8.1 users will get 
an Express Settings prompt – be sure to 
click the option to customise these and 
go through them carefully.
Post-Creators Update, Windows 10 no 
longer gives you an Express Settings 
option. For now, confirm your location 
and keyboard, set up your network if 
required and choose ‘personal use’ 
when prompted. You can either sign in 
with your Microsoft account or click 
‘Offline account’ > ‘Maybe later’ if you 
plan to stick with the old-style Windows 
7 local user account. 
If you opt for the Microsoft account 
option now is a good time to set up a 
PIN to speed up future logins (note: the 
PIN is tied, specifically, to this PC, and 
you can always bypass it using your 
regular account password should you 
forget it at any point).
You’ll then be asked to set up Cortana 
– this is where Windows 10’s notorious 
privacy settings come into play, so 
review all of the options carefully, 
flicking the slider to Off for any you 
don’t need or use.
That’s the end of the setup process 
– Windows will now configure itself 
based on each of your choices and you’ll 
see a series of messages appear 
on-screen. Eventually, when all is ready, 
you’ll find yourself back at the familiar 
Windows desktop screen. ■
Start the install process
“Next comes potentially the trickiest part of the process.  
A list of drives and partitions will appear – you need to 
select the one Windows is currently installed on”
Make sure you’ve got network and graphics drivers sourced.

Ian Evenden says…
“Premiere Elements 2018 
makes editing your home 
movies easy and fun!”

Learn how to…
Easily edit your 
home movies
“With Premiere Elements 2018, it’s 
easy to turn those phone videos 
into something more professional”
ideo editing is rather a 
different beast to photo 
editing. Not only can you 
apply effects and corrections to your 
movies as you would a photograph, 
but you also get to piece together a 
narrative and enhance it with audio, 
titles and more.
This means a video editing app will 
look and feel different to a photo 
editor. If you’ve never used one 
before, it can feel very much like 
being thrown in the deep end and 
then being expected to swim. It can 
be rather intimidating if you don’t 
know what you’re doing.
 Adobe’s Premiere Elements 2018 
app comes with tutorials that teach 
you how it works and, even better, is 
available as a 30-day free trial. With 
its Guided mode, you’ll be able to 
follow tutorials for all skill levels, from 
getting started with the app to 
adding animated graphics to your 
movies. Let’s take a look.
1 Add your media
The first thing you need to do is import your video files into 
Premiere Elements. Well, first you have to shoot some footage, but 
we’ll assume you’ve done that. You can import footage from your 
camera, a DVD, or from files on your PC. You can also use the 
Elements Organizer, a useful companion app that takes a lot of 
the hard work out of organising your media files on your PC.
2 Meet the Timeline
The first thing you’ll notice when you’ve imported a video 
clip is the way it appears on the Timeline at the bottom of the 
interface. You can drop more clips onto the Timeline, dragging

3 Current Time Indicator
Editing your movie then becomes like a sculpture, removing 
the bits you don’t want to reveal the artwork within the block of 
stone. The red line on the Timeline is your Current Time Indicator 
(CTI) which progresses through your movie as you play it in the 
preview window, and shows you exactly where you are. Moving it 
left and right previews different sections of your video.
4 Trimming
To snip footage from the beginning or end of your video, 
move your mouse pointer to the end or start of the timeline, until 
it becomes a double-headed arrow with a red square bracket on 
it. With this pointer, drag into your clip either from the left (start) 
or right (end) to select the footage to be trimmed. Release the 
button and the timeline will reflect the new start/end point.
Jargon buster!
 timeline
Displays your movie 
in chronological 
order from left to

or titles onto it.
 Keyframes
These define the

of transitions, titles 
and other changes 
that occur over time 
in your movie.

9 Audio
There are many audio clips in Premiere Elements. Click the 
Audio button on the right, looking like a musical note, and drag 
them onto the audio part of your Timeline. Again, they may need 
to download first. Once on the Timeline, audio clips are treated 
like video clips, and can be split and trimmed to fit. If you find one 
you like, a single checkbox makes it last the length of your movie.
7 Add titles
Titles and Text lives on the right toolbar, looking like a ‘T’ on 
a filmstrip. Click this, and a panel opens with a huge selection of 
text styles for your titles. Some of them need to be downloaded if 
you’ve not used them before, so make sure you’re connected to 
the Internet. Drag your chosen style to the beginning of your clip, 
or after a prologue section, and put end credits at the end.
5  
Splitting a clip
Splitting a clip makes it into two separate ones that can be 
adjusted independently. Move the CTI to a point in your Timeline 
you’d like to insert a split, and click the scissors icon that appears 
next to the red line. The areas to the left and right of the CTI will 
change colour. Now you’ve split the clip, you can trim the newly 
created ends, insert a transition between the two, or do both.
10 Save and export
Saving your project gives you a .prel file, which only opens 
in Premiere Elements. To play your movie somewhere else, you’ll 
need to export it. Choose ‘Export and Share’ from the File menu, 
and in the window that appears you’ll find presets for devices and 
video sites, such as TVs, phones, YouTube or Facebook. Custom 
settings are available too. Give it a name and hit Save. ■
8  
Custom text
The text adjustments panel can be opened by double-
clicking your titles on the Timeline. Select the existing filler text to 
replace it with your own, then either choose a font and size from 
Text, or pick from one of the previews on the Style panel. 
Animation is the next one over, and lets you fade your text in, 
appearing letter by letter, or perhaps spinning onto the screen.
6 Transitions
A transition is a way of moving from one scene to the next. 
Open the Transitions panel from the right-hand toolbar – it looks 
like two triangles in shades of blue. Choose the transition you 
want from the selection on offer, and drop it between two clips 
on your Timeline. It can be hard to see, but it appears as a thicker 
blue line across your video Timeline. Drag the CTI to preview it.

It might not be the biggest name in web browsers, but Vivaldi’s 
range of unique features definitely make it worth a look
ou might be more used to surfing 
the web using programs such as 
Internet Explorer, Edge, Mozilla 
Firefox and Google Chrome, but they’re 
not the only browsers out there. 
Vivaldi is a relatively new arrival on the 
scene, having been around for less than 
two years, but it’s no slouch. Its web page 
rendering engine, known as Blink, is 
precisely the same as the one used in 
Google Chrome, and it includes a host of 
features you won’t find anywhere else. 
It’s a web browser built to keep you 
organised, to help you browse in comfort, 
and help you do more: it’s compatible with 
most of the extensions available to 
Google Chrome, for example, barring 
those that change Chrome’s user interface, 
so you can really make it your own. 
Admittedly Vivaldi is not particularly 
popular yet, grabbing only a 0.04 percent 
share of the world browser market, but 
don’t let that stop you giving it a try – we’ll 
walk you through its key features here.
Learn how to…
Get started with Vivaldi
Y
Step-by-step Install and master Vivaldi
1 Get the browser
In whatever web browser you like – we’re using Edge – head 
to www.vivaldi.com and click the big Free Download button to set 
Vivaldi on its way to you. Once it’s downloaded, run the installer 
and click the ‘Accept and Install’ button to confirm that you agree 
with the terms of service and unpack Vivaldi onto your PC. When 
everything is complete, Vivaldi will run for the first time.
2 Early choices
Your first choice is to select Vivaldi’s colour scheme. The 
browser will change colour as you use it, depending on the page 
you’re viewing, so pick a base scheme which you’re comfortable 
with – maybe steer clear of Hot Pink. Next, select where your 
browser tabs appear; you’ll be used to them being at the top, and 
since this takes the least screen space, stick to this option for now.
3 Touch ups
Next you’ll be able to pick a background for the Vivaldi start 
page, then click the Get In Touch button to see more options. 
Vivaldi is built on, and for, its community. For now just click Start 
Browsing to see Vivaldi’s opening page, called Speed Dial. There’s 
a lot here you won’t want, so clean it out by hovering over any 
unwanted links and clicking the ‘–’ icon at their top right corner.
4 Set it up
Click the cog in the bottom-right corner of the Vivaldi 
window, head to the Search tab, and set Google as your default 
search engine. You’ll see a bunch of keyboard shortcuts next to 
each search engine here; if you ever want to search, for instance, 
Bing, you can just type its shortcut followed by a space in the 
search or address bars at the top, then add your query.

5  
Stack ‘em up
The way Vivaldi handles tabs is one of its best assets. To see 
how it works search Google for something, then open a new tab 
with the ‘+’ button in the tabs bar and search for something else. 
Right-click one of the tabs, then select ‘stack tabs by host’. This 
consolidates everything from Google into a single tab – to switch 
between them, hover over that tab and pick the one you want.
6 Tiling tabs
One of the most irritating things about most web browsers 
is using several pages side by side; comparing information from 
one web page to another often involves a lot of clicking – not so 
in Vivaldi. Right-click your tab stack and select Tile Tab Stack to 
split your browser window in two; repeat the action and select 
Untile Tab Stack to go back when you’re done.
7 Make a note
Tiling isn’t the only way to keep information handy. If you’re 
doing research, Vivaldi’s Note function is hugely useful. Highlight 
some text on a web page by clicking and dragging it, right-click 
the highlighted text, and select ‘Copy to Note’. Not only does this 
copy the text, it also takes a screenshot of the page you’re looking 
at for later reference. You can sort your notes into folders, too.
8  
Pin it up
Pinning a tab by right-clicking it and selecting Pin Tab (note 
this only works with single tabs, not stacks) reduces it in size and 
pushes it to the left of your tab list. A pinned tab can’t be closed 
until you unpin it, so it’s kept safe – perfect for keeping your email 
or social media pages handy when working on something slightly 
less distracting, or packing more tabs into less space.
Top TabS
Managing tabs is at 
the heart of Vivaldi. 
Tabs don’t have to 
be placed at the top 
– you can put them 
wherever you like. 
Super Sidebar
In Vivaldi, you can 
access bookmarks, 
downloads, web 
history and notes 
without ever leaving 
your current page. 
CuSTom ToolS
Use the ‘+’ button 
and you can add 
your own sidebar 
apps; point Vivaldi at 
a suitable web page 
to keep it handy. 
Fine ConTrol
Vivaldi’s settings are 
super deep and built 
for making intricate 
changes – this is 
web browsing 
exactly as you like it.

9 Extend it
Click the ‘V’ icon at the top-left corner of the window, and 
head to Tools > Extensions. You’ll have no add-ons installed at this 
point, but click the link to head to the Chrome web store. Find the 
extension you want (note: visual add-ons likely won’t work), click 
the Add button, then ‘Add extension’, and it’ll install, creating a 
new icon to the right of the search box.
10 Easy reading
Take a look at the icons along the bottom bar of the Vivaldi 
window. On the right, there’s a size slider, so you can zoom a page 
in or out, and just to the left of that is a button which fires off a list 
of options, some of which are useful – the sepia filter can calm 
down busy pages, and there’s a content blocker on offer – and 
some less useful. Do you really need to view web pages in 3D? ■
ALex’s best tip!
Click and drag individual 
tabs to open them in a new 
window – you can drop tabs 
between windows, too.
Zoom & CapTure
This panel includes a 
range of tools. Drag 
the slider to zoom, 
and the left-most 
button to take a 
webpage snapshot.

and it’ll show the 
Speed Dial page – a 
quick way to jump

matter most to you.

a rendering engine 
to turn the raw code 
of the web into the 
pages you see.

engines can handle 
certain elements 
slightly differently 
from others.
 extensions
Add capabilities to 
any web browser,

 Tabs
Rather than covering 
your screen in a 
cascade of windows, 
tabs keep your open 
pages organised in a 
sensible way.

Make your PC 
more secure
“Ensure every part of Windows 10 
is as secure as can be with this 
ultimate guide”
indows 10 is the safest and 
most secure version 
Microsoft has ever made, 
thanks in part to the inclusion of the 
built-in anti-virus software Windows 
Defender, which does an excellent 
job of keeping your Windows 10 
device protected right out of the box. 
However, there are still a number of 
things you can do to ensure your PC 
is completely safe, and that’s where 
this guide comes in. 
Windows 10 is becoming the most 
popular operating system in the 
world, and that means that virus 
makers are increasingly looking to 
target the software. We’ll show you 
how to browse the web safely and 
securely using Windows 10’s tools. 
We’ll also help you set up a virtual 
private network (VPN), which will give 
you an even greater level of privacy 
and security when browsing the 
Internet, and we’ll help you correctly 
set Windows 10’s default settings.
1 Make sure you’re up-to-date
One of the most important ways of keeping Windows 10 
secure is by ensuring that you have the latest updates installed. 
These updates often contain important protection against any 
new threats. Type ‘updates’ into the search box in Windows’ 
Taskbar, then click ‘Windows Update settings’. Click ‘Check for 
updates’ to make sure that Windows 10 is fully updated.
2 Configure Windows Defender
Windows Defender is Windows 10’s built-in anti-virus 
software. It should be on by default, but to check type ‘Windows 
Defender’ into the search box in the Taskbar, and select ‘Windows 
Defender Security Centre’.  You’ll see an overview of the security 
status of your device. You should see a green tick next to each 
section. If not, click the icon to find out what you need to do.

3 Make use of SmartScreen
SmartScreen is a tool that protects you against harmful files 
and websites. From the Windows Defender Security Centre app, 
click ‘App & browser control’. You can set SmartScreen to warn you 
if you download a suspicious app or file, or visit a compromised 
website or, to be completely secure, select Block to automatically 
prevent potentially dangerous files or websites from opening.
4 Using third party anti-virus software
Windows Defender will help keep your Windows 10 device 
secure, although it is a little basic. For anti-virus apps with more 
advanced security features, check out our pick of the best free 
solutions at http://bit.ly/2CD1F7t. For even more security a 
paid-for solution – which offers even more tools – may be best. 
Go to http://bit.ly/2Cc1GhF for our recommendations.
Jargon buster!
 VPn
VPN stands for 
Virtual Private 
Network. By 
connecting to a 
private network, 
users can send and 
receive data securely, 
and because it’s 
‘virtual’ it means it 
doesn’t need a 
physical network – it 
can just use your 
existing network or 
Internet connection.
 Biometrics
Biometrics is a way 
of securing your 
Windows 10 device 
using either your 
fingerprint or by 
scanning your face. 
It’s an incredibly 
convenient – and 
secure – way of 
logging into 
Windows 10, as long 
as you have the right 
hardware. Many 
modern laptops 
come with finger-
print scanners or 
Windows Hello 
approved webcams.
 taskbar
The Taskbar in 
Windows 10 runs 
along the bottom of 
your screen and 
houses the Start 
button, the Cortana 
search box, time and 
date information, 
network information 
and much more.

9 Use a VPN – Part one
For the ultimate in PC security, you can use a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN), which encrypts all your web traffic. To begin with 
you’ll want to choose a VPN service to subscribe to. If you want to 
try a VPN, or only use it occasionally, a free version should be fine 
– see http://bit.ly/2CFXfwR. For a faster VPN experience head to 
http://bit.ly/2CFVuzL for a rundown of the best VPN services.
7 Secure your Microsoft account
For the best Windows 10 experience you’ll want to use a 
Microsoft account to sign into Windows 10. if you have one, go to 
https://account.microsoft.com to check your account. From here 
you can change your password, review purchases and change 
your payment methods. You can also see which devices are 
logged into your Microsoft account, and where they are.
5  
Bolster your sign-in
Using a strong password to log into Windows 10 will help 
keep you secure. If you haven’t already set one, type ‘sign-in’ into 
the search box, then select ‘Sign-in options’. From the window 
that appears you can change your password or add a PIN. If you 
have a webcam or fingerprint scanner, you can set up Windows 
Hello, which uses biometrics for logging into Windows 10.
10 Use a VPN – Part two
Once you’ve signed up to a VPN service, head to Start > 
Settings. Select ‘Network & Internet’ then VPN and click ‘Add a VPN 
connection’. Select ‘Windows (built-in)’ as the VPN provider, then 
fill in the rest of the boxes. Use the information you received 
when you signed up for the VPN. Once done, you can switch to 
the VPN by clicking on the network icon on the Taskbar. ■
8  
Protect your files with BitLocker
BitLocker is a Windows 10 Pro feature that enables you to 
encrypt your hard drive. To activate it, type ‘bitlocker’ into the 
search box and press [Enter]. Choose the drives you want to 
encrypt, then click ‘Turn BitLocker on’. Follow the instructions to 
create a password and/or USB key – you will need to use these to 
access Windows and your files once BitLocker’s been set up.
6 Check your privacy settings
When it was first released, Windows 10 got some flack for its 
default privacy settings. Since then Microsoft has implemented 
better privacy controls, but they’re still worth investigating. Type 
‘privacy’ into the search box, and click ‘Privacy settings’ from the 
results that appear. From there go through each option on the 
left-hand menu and set what you want to share accordingly.

Travel smarter 
 with your laptop
“Anyone can toss a laptop into a bag, but clever 
travellers employ a few more tricks to get the 
most out of their PC on the move”
hen you’re away from home, 
there’s no need to 
disconnect from the digital 
world. You could rely on your phone, 
as we so often do, but taking your 
laptop out of the living room and 
onto the road is the best way to get 
everything done – from work to 
bigger-screen entertainment. This is 
particularly true if you’re going 
further afield, but it’s important not 
to take travel lightly.
Without the guarantee of Internet 
connectivity, you’ll need to prepare a 
little before you leave. Without 
permanent power, pulling as much 
life out of your battery as possible is 
massively important. And carrying 
that laptop with you introduces other 
dangers, so a couple of steps to 
ensure your security is up to scratch 
go a long way. None of this takes a 
long time, none of it’s difficult, but 
you’ll be glad you’ve done it when 
the time comes.
1 Manage your battery
By far the most obvious factor to consider when travelling is 
battery life. Even if you don’t fancy creating a cut-down profile to 
maximise your juice, clicking the battery icon post-Fall Creators 
Update reveals a handy slider which allows you to balance your 
laptop’s performance and power use. Pull it towards the left, and 
you’ll get a few extra minutes in exchange for slightly less grunt.
2 Offline apps
As our work habits change and we all begin to rely on cloud 
apps like Google Docs, losing them when not Internet-connected 
can be a big bind. Thankfully, it’s possible to use Docs, Sheets and 
Slides offline. Just head to one of them in Google Chrome, click 
the three-line icon, the cog, then select Offline. Then set your key 
documents to be available offline by right-clicking them.

laptop in your hotel room?

7 Watch the Wi-Fi
Be wary of public Wi-Fi – it’s not unknown for spurious 
connections to eavesdrop on traffic and steal personal 
information. If you’re likely to need Internet connectivity, make 
sure you pack appropriate protection in the form of a free VPN like 
Windscribe (windscribe.com). Launch it before you connect, and 
it’ll make everything you do private and impossible to snoop on.
8 Keep it cool
When you’re not using your laptop, don’t just shut the lid. 
Switch it off by clicking the Start button, the power icon, and 
selecting Shut Down. Not only does this save a small amount of 
battery, it reduces the risk of the machine waking itself up in your 
bag – a poorly ventilated laptop is prone to overheating, and if 
you cook your PC you could lose your data or worse. ■
5 Back it up
That thing you’re carrying? It’s fragile. And if you rely on 
your laptop, having it smashed beyond repair in your luggage is 
not ideal. Before you go, make sure you’ve copied everything you 
care about to a cloud storage solution like Google Drive or to an 
external drive. Take a USB flash drive with you, and copy anything 
new – like photos – onto it, and keep it apart from your laptop.
3 Watch the weather
Windows 10’s built-in Weather app is probably set to your 
home location by default, but setting it to keep an eye on your 
destination is a great idea. Open it, click the Settings cog in the 
bottom-left corner, and type your destination in ‘launch location’. 
If you don’t want to change the default, use the magnifying glass 
icon to search for a different locale as long as you’re online.
6 Protect it
Worse than having your laptop break is having it stolen – 
particularly if it’s not hardened enough to keep a would-be 
identity thief out. Change your password via Settings > Accounts 
> ‘Sign-in options’, and make sure it’s secure by using a mixture of 
numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and punctuation. If you 
use memorable words, make sure there’s three or more in a row.
4 Convert currency
What’s your money worth? Windows’ Calculator app can tell 
you – and convert all kinds of other local units into a format you’re 
comfortable with. Open it, click the three-line icon, and select 
Currency. Then use the drop-downs to switch between different 
currencies, and click one of the values to select the currency 
you’re converting from. Note: update the rates before you leave!

Extend your wireless 
broadband range 
“Whether you have wireless woes or you just want to 
extend the range of your Wi-Fi network then you’ve 
come to the right place”
recent survey of UK 
broadband users revealed 
that 40 percent of us with 
slow Internet connections take no 
action and wait for any problems to 
fix themselves. However, there’s no 
need to be so passive, because it’s 
relatively easy to diagnose whether 
there is an issue with your Wi-Fi – or 
your Internet connection.  
Often range-related issues can be a 
problem with the router and we’ll 
give you some steps so you can easily 
diagnose these. But what if you want 
to extend the range of your network? 
We’ll talk about that, too. And we’ll 
talk you through solutions that don’t 
need you to buy new hardware as 
well as those that do. 
It’s also worth ensuring your 
connection woes aren’t device-
specific. Older PCs especially are 
prone to getting so clogged up with 
stuff that they’re mega slow, so test 
your connection on different devices.
1 Test your broadband speed
If you’re having problems with your network, then test your 
broadband speed. This will help you know how long a file takes to 
download and ensure you’re not blaming your Wi-Fi for an issue 
that isn’t there (or is to do with your ISP). Speedtest.net is one of 
the best sites for testing your broadband speed. You can see your 
ping speed as well as your download and upload speeds.
2 Is your problem speed not range? 
If your broadband speed is OK – or not poor enough to 
affect your network, then move on to the steps that follow. If your 
broadband speed is poor, it maybe your broadband rather than 
Wi-Fi that’s to blame – perhaps because you don’t have fibre 
broadband or live a long way from the telephone exchange. If this 
is the case you might want to explore your options with your ISP.

Don’t place your router near 
a fish tank; water is a killer 
for efficient Wi-Fi. Also try to 
put it in a central location .

7 What about the position of your router? 
If you’re having issues in areas of your house you shouldn’t 
be, consider changing the location of your router. Move it away 
from windows, shared walls and electrical appliances, especially 
any other telephony or wireless equipment. According to Post 
Office research, over a quarter of people have placed their router 
by the TV or an electrical appliance, which can slow Wi-Fi speeds.
8 What about extenders and Powerline? 
If our steps so far haven’t solved your problem, then 
consider an extender to target a particular area of your house. 
Options are available from vendors such as Belkin and Netgear 
and cost upwards of £20. You could also consider Powerline – 
some Powerline plugs also have Wi-Fi, again enabling you to 
target a specific area of your home with its own Wi-Fi network. ■
5 Is there anybody else on your network? 
You should ensure your network is password-protected. Is 
there any chance someone else could be using your Wi-Fi? If you 
have an open network you are asking for a slower connection. The 
only possible reason for having an open connection is if you live 
somewhere so remote that nobody is ever going to connect to 
your network. Generally, however, it is a no-no. 
3 The telltale signs 
If the connection is intermittent, consider how far you are 
from the router at that point (see Step 7). If you run out of range 
then the network itself will drop out. It’s also worth considering 
what kind of house you have. If it’s big (more than four bedrooms, 
say) or tall (three storeys) then you will almost certainly need to 
invest in a device to extend your range (see Steps 8 and 9).
6 How old is your client device? 
Make sure the device you’re connecting to the Internet with 
has the latest software and Windows updates installed. It may not 
make a difference, but it’s good to rule it out. If it’s a particularly 
old device, then it may be less compatible with the latest 
connectivity standards, and this may make a difference to the 
range you can expect to achieve with it.
4 What router do you have? 
The problem might not be with your broadband – it might 
be with your router. If you have a router that’s less than five years 
old, you should expect it to easily cover a modern house. If your 
router is older, it’s time for a replacement. We’d recommend 
replacing routers that aren’t compatible with 802.11n at the very 
least. If your router has 802.11ac, it shouldn’t have a problem.

Get things done with 
Microsoft To-Do
“List, schedule and tick off day-to-day tasks with 
Microsoft To-Do, and sync to your mobile devices”
he team that gave the world 
Wunderlist has outdone 
itself once again with the 
powerful and free Microsoft To-Do. 
This app keeps your life organised by 
setting tasks to be completed either 
today or at a date you specify in the 
future. Just set yourself a reminder. If 
you find it difficult to wade through 
reams of items, take advantage of the 
handy lists feature, which enables 
you to categorise your tasks. 
The app is also available for 
Android, iOS and Windows Phone 
and can sync automatically via your 
Microsoft account, provided you’re 
signed in with the same account on 
all your devices. 
Microsoft Outlook users will be 
pleased to hear that Microsoft To-Do 
can also sync with Outlook tasks, 
however it doesn’t currently support 
advanced features, such as file 
attachments. See http://bit.
ly/2CcgJrQ for more information. 
1 Install the app
Click the Microsoft Store icon on your Taskbar and type 
‘To-Do’ in the search bar at the top-right. The app should be listed 
automatically below the search bar. Click it to load the app page. 
Next, click the Get button on the page to download the app itself. 
Once installation is complete click the Launch button to open 
Microsoft To-Do. Click ‘Pin to Start’ to add it to the Start menu. 
2 Add to your day
Once Microsoft To-Do launches click OK to dismiss the 
message informing you that every day is a fresh start. Click ‘Add a 
to-do’ to add your first item for today. Once you’re done, click on 
Add on the right or press [Enter] to save your task. If your name 
appears incorrectly at the top left, click it, choose Sign Out and 
then ‘Sign in’ with your own Microsoft account.

7 Add new lists
To add a new list, click ‘+ New list’ on the left. Type a name 
for the list and press [Return] to confirm. Click the name itself at 
the top to edit the name. You can also click to add an emoji to 
distinguish your list from others. Click the ellipsis (…) button at 
the top right to set a new colourful theme for this list too. Add 
tasks in exactly the same way as before.
8 Syncing tasks
Mobile versions of Microsoft To-Do are available for 
Android, iOS and Windows Phone. If you install the mobile app 
and sign in with your Microsoft account, your lists and to-do items 
should sync automatically between devices. If this isn’t happening 
click your account icon at the top left then Settings. Click the blue 
Sync button. Microsoft To-Do can also sync with Outlook tasks. ■
5 Add a due date
Due dates are distinct from reminders and are very useful. 
For instance, you can set a reminder to start revising for an exam 
on the 15th of the month and schedule it for the 25th. To do this, 
select any task and click ‘Add due date’. Choose either Tomorrow 
or ‘Next week’. If you prefer to ‘Pick a Date’, a pop-up calendar 
appears allowing you to do this in the same way as for a reminder.
3 Add to your To-Do list
Click ‘To-Do’ in the left-hand pane to switch to your To-Do 
list. Any items you’ve added to My Day are still listed here but you 
can use To-Do to schedule less immediate tasks. These are created 
in exactly the same way as for My Day. To mark a task as complete 
click/touch to highlight it and then select the circle on the left. A 
green tick will appear next to completed tasks.
6 Manage repeating events
If you have set a due date for an event, you’ll see an option 
named Repeat appear underneath. Click this to choose to repeat 
an event daily, weekly, or monthly from that date. Select ‘custom’ 
to choose something more bespoke. For instance you may go for 
ice cream with your friend Elizabeth every three weeks. Use the 
drop-down menu to switch between days, weeks and months.
4 Set a reminder
If you click or press on a task, a new pane will open on the 
right of the screen. Choose ‘Remind me’ to schedule a reminder. 
Choose from the default options (today, tomorrow, next week). 
Alternatively select ‘Pick a date & time’ to choose a specific date 
from the pop-up calendar. The timer uses a 12-hour clock so be 
sure to set AM/PM correctly. Click ‘Save’ when you’re done.

Get remote access to 
a family or friend’s PC
“Struggling to fix a family or friend’s PC over the 
phone? Quick Assist lets you take control of their 
computer over the Internet to provide tech support”
f you’re the go-to person in 
your family or circle of 
friends for technical support, 
you know how frustrating it can be 
– either you’re expected to magically 
fix problems over the phone or you 
have to drag yourself in front of the 
afflicted PC to attempt to find a cure.
No more. Quick Assist is a feature 
introduced in the Anniversary Update 
of Windows 10 that enables you to 
easily take remote control of 
someone’s PC from the comfort of 
your own computer, giving you the 
flexibility to investigate, diagnose and 
hopefully fix their problem. This 
step-by-step guide reveals how it 
works, and provides all the fail-safes 
your contacts will need to reassure 
them that they remain in control at all 
times. So log on with Quick Assist, 
make sure they’re backed up, fix their 
problem and get them off your back 
once and for all.
1 Launch Quick Assist
Click Search on your PC and type ‘quick’, then click Quick 
Assist to get started. Choose ‘Give assistance’ and sign in with your 
Microsoft account. Once signed in, a six-digit numerical code will 
appear – use one of the three options (clipboard to copy to secure 
message, email or ‘Provide instructions’ to communicate verbally 
over the phone) to convey the code to the person requiring help.
2 Connect to your PC
Your recipient needs to launch Quick Assist on their PC and 
choose ‘Get assistance’, then type in the six-digit code you’ve 
communicated from the previous step. Click ‘Submit’ and wait 
while a Connecting sign appears on both their and (eventually) 
your PC – this can take some time. They then need to read the 
warning before clicking Allow to complete the connection.

7 Other tools
There’s a pen button at the top that should allow you to 
scribble on your friend’s PC as you work on it – you can use this to 
communicate ideas, for example. Click the Eraser or Exit buttons 
to clear the marks. There’s also a shortcut button that opens Task 
Manager on your friend’s PC – you’ll need this since pressing [Ctrl] 
+ [Alt] + [Delete] will only open Task Manager on your own PC.
8 Ending the session
You’ll also see Pause and Stop buttons for suspending the 
connection (click Play to resume) or end it altogether. The person 
you’re helping has access to these buttons too – if they pause the 
connection you’re locked out until they resume it, or they can 
click the ‘X’ button to close it at any time. It means they can give 
you access to their PC without ever losing control of it. ■
5 Attempt fixes
As you point, click and type – all of which can be viewed by 
the person you’re helping, who can also continue to use their PC 
as normal (so you may need to ask them to step back if they’re 
interfering with your troubleshooting) – you’ll notice a slight lag. 
This is normal, and the extent of the delay will be down to the 
speed of your respective Internet connections.
3 Set up desktop screen
Once connected, the person receiving help will see a Quick 
Assist screen at the top with ‘Screen sharing on’ displayed. You’ll 
then see their screen appear in the main Quick Assist window. It’s 
likely that the whole screen hasn’t been displayed – either 
manually resize the program window in the usual manner or click 
the Fit Screen button as shown to fit it in the program window.
6 Reboot without reconnecting
If your fixes involve restarting your friend’s PC, do so by 
clicking the Restart button at the top of the screen. Unlike a 
normal shutdown or restart, this will temporarily suspend the 
connection between your two PCs, then attempt to restore it 
once Windows has rebooted successfully on the target machine, 
saving you the bother of having to reconnect again manually.
4 Take control
You can now access the other person’s PC, using its own 
tools to troubleshoot. If the person you’re helping isn’t logged on 
as an administrator, you’ll see a warning to that effect. It means 
that whenever you attempt to perform any administrative tasks, 
the screen will go black and the person you’re helping will need 
to enter the password of an administrator account on that PC.

BITCOIN
HOW TO MINE
44  |  
  |  February 2018
M
ining is the process of using a 
computer to perform complex 
calculations on blocks of data 
which maintain the Bitcoin network. 
Miners are rewarded for their efforts with 
a certain amount of Bitcoins.
Bitcoin (BTC) is fast becoming the 
province of people using specialised ASIC 
(application-specific integrated circuit) 
devices, although if you have one or 
more powerful graphics cards you may 
be able to make a small profit by building 
your own mining device. You’ll learn 
more about this in the following steps.
Any profit you make will depend on a 
number of factors. The first is your ‘hash 
rate’, or the actual processing power of 
your PC. Computers designed for mining, 
or ‘rigs’ as they’re commonly known, 
require large amounts of electricity, 
which will increase running costs. The 
complexity of mining also rises over time.
The Bitcoin itself is a very volatile 
virtual currency and while it has recently 
made huge gains, it may also plummet in 
value. Bear this in mind if you plan to 
hold onto any BTC you mine rather than 
selling immediately. If you want a rough 
idea of how much you can make from 
mining, use one of the many online 
profitability calculators (for example, the 
one at https://99bitcoins.com).
While you can technically try to mine 
Bitcoin on your own, it’s very unlikely that 
your rig will singlehandedly solve the 
complex sums necessary to receive a 
reward. Instead, you’ll need to join a 
mining pool. As the name suggests, this 
is a pool of multiple machines connected 
together, engaged in a collaborative 
mining effort. Any Bitcoin rewards that 
are reaped are shared amongst everyone 
who contributed processing power to the 
mining effort.
However, note that the way in which 
profits are shared can vary from pool to 
pool. You can learn more about pooled 
mining at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/
Turn your PC into a mining machine...By Alan Dexter & Nate Drake
01
Choose your miner
One easy – but not cheap – way to get started with Bitcoin mining is to buy 
an ASIC device, such as the AntMiner S9. These devices have been specifically 
designed for mining Bitcoins which means they’ll generally give you the greatest 
return on your investment. 
However, as mentioned, these ASIC devices are expensive. The S9 for instance 
currently retails for around €2,100 (about £1,860). You will usually need to buy a 
separate power supply unit which will set you back something like another €300 
(£265). These devices are usually designed specifically to mine Bitcoin and will not 
function well if you try to use them to mine other cryptocurrencies (if, say, Bitcoin 
should happen to fall drastically in value). 
Alternatively you can build your own Bitcoin mining rig. While these aren’t as 
efficient in terms of power and hash rate, they require less upfront expense and can 
mine other currencies besides BTC. In the simplest terms these are computers with 
multiple powerful graphics cards installed. These GPUs might be primarily designed 
to render complex graphics when playing games, but they also lend themselves well 
to coping with the complex calculations involved in Bitcoin mining.
To get started, you’ll need to purchase a case for the machine. Most of these are a 
simple metal frame to allow heat to dissipate easily. You’ll then need to choose a 
motherboard and graphics cards for mining, such as the AMD Radeon RX 580.
If you need some more advice, see our guides on choosing the best graphics cards 
(http://bit.ly/2DE4sOt) and motherboards (http://bit.ly/2D8eC94) for mining. You’ll 
need to assemble the machine and install the OS and mining software yourself, so 
you should only go down this route if you are tech-savvy and familiar with computers.
If neither of these options appeals to you, you can rent hash power from cloud 
mining companies. These firms have dedicated data centres devoted to mining 
Bitcoins. As they are centralised they can buy machines in bulk and use efficient 
methods to generate electricity.
Most companies will offer you a fixed amount of Gigahash Seconds (GH/s) of 
mining power for a fee. The advantage is that you don’t need to buy any hardware. 
The fees for cloud mining will vary, however, and another point to be wary of is 
scammers posing as cloud mining outfits. See the Bitcoin Wiki for reputable vendors.

02
Set up your Bitcoin wallet
Once you’ve decided that mining’s right for you, you’ll also 
need to set up a Bitcoin wallet to store your profits. If you’re mining 
as an investment and don’t plan on spending any of your coins 
soon, consider using a website such as https://bitcoinpaperwallet.
com to create a ‘paper’ wallet. Make a note of the ‘public’ address, 
which you can use to receive payments.
You can check the balance of your wallet at any time by visiting 
Blockchain.info and entering your payment address into the search 
bar at the top-right. Don’t let anyone see your private keys as 
anyone with access to your paper wallet can control your Bitcoins.
If you plan to regularly cash out your BTC or make payments, 
consider using a software wallet. The Electrum wallet (https://
electrum.org/) is available for all major desktop operating systems 
and Android. When you create your wallet, Electrum will generate 
a ‘seed’ of a dozen random words to use as a private key. This 
enables you to restore your wallet if anything happens to your PC.
If you use a software wallet, try to do it on a machine that isn’t 
connected to the Internet so your BTC can’t be hacked. This is 
known as ‘cold storage’. The Electrum website has instructions for 
setting up a ‘watching’ wallet for day-to-day use which can show 
your balance but cannot make payments itself. For full instructions 
on setting up secure offline storage, see http://bit.ly/2Dxa3WC.
03
Pick a Bitcoin  
mining pool
The next stage is to sign up to a 
pool; you can solo mine, but you need 
some serious hardware to make it 
worthwhile. You can find a list of pools 
on the Bitcoin wiki.
We’ll walk you through the process 
of signing up for Slush Pool (https://
slushpool.com/) because it’s one 
we’ve used a lot, but the same 
procedure can be used for any of 
the major mining pools.
04
Jump in
Head to the Slush Pool 
website and click ‘Sign up here’. 
On the registration page choose 
a username, then enter your 
email address and password. 
You will be sent a confirmation 
email. Click the link to validate 
your email address. You’ll see 
that a ‘worker’ has been created 
for you, so you can begin 
mining. You should ideally have 
one worker per device. You can 
visit the Slush Pool site at any 
time to view and create workers. 
05
Funded mining
You need to tell your mining pool where 
and when to send the funds from your mining 
exploits. On the Slush Pool website you can do 
this by clicking Settings at the top-right, then 
clicking Bitcoin on the left. Choose ‘Payouts’ then 
click the New Wallet button. Paste in your public 
address for Bitcoin payouts here. If you’re using a 
paper wallet this should be clearly marked. In 
Electrum you can view your current receiving 
address by clicking on the Receive tab. Click 
‘Submit’ when you’re done.
Some miners also enable you to choose the 
payout threshold – in other words how many BTC 
you need to have mined before the Pool sends 
funds to your wallet. This is important as while it’s 
risky to leave large amounts of BTC in an online 
wallet, transaction fees for sending BTC across the 
network are currently very high, so you could end 
up paying a lot for multiple smaller payments. 
Choose freely and wisely.

06
Pool safety
Mining pools are a popular 
target for hackers for obvious reasons. 
To make sure no one can potentially 
pilfer your Bitcoins, first check that 
your pool uses SSL. This means your 
connection is secure – in most web 
browsers you’ll see a padlock icon (in 
the address bar) if this is the case.
Certain mining pools, such as Slush 
Pool, also enable you to secure access 
to your account by using two-factor 
authentication. This introduces a 
second step for a successful login, and 
is therefore another hurdle to prevent 
hackers from breaking into your 
account. To use this you’ll need access 
to a mobile device and an app such as 
Google Authenticator or Free OTP.
09
View your progress
GUIMiner should now 
communicate with the servers to get 
shares for your machine to work with. 
You’ll see your hash rate at the bottom 
right and the current state of your 
work in the bottom bar.
You can also see the console (useful 
if you have connection problems) or a 
summary page (great if you have 
multiple cards) via the View menu.
07
Grab Bitcoin 
mining software
Now you need to download the 
mining software to your PC. You 
have a few options here, but to 
get started we’d recommend 
using GUIMiner (https://
guiminer.org), if only because it 
has a straightforward interface.
It comes as a self-extracting 
archive and runs straight from 
the folder to which it’s extracted. 
08
Configure mining
Launch GUIMiner and select 
‘Slush’s pool’ from the Server menu. Type in 
the name of the worker that was created 
when you registered your account – it’ll be 
[username].worker1 – and enter the 
password for the worker.
Select your graphics card from the 
Device menu and then click the ‘Start 
mining’ button to get going.

Time to 
optimise
If you’re running a mining 
rig instead of specialised 
hardware, you can make a 
few tweaks to make sure its 
running at peak efficiency.
To do that, do a quick 
search to see what the 
recommend flags are for 
your graphics card by 
heading to the Mining 
hardware comparison 
page at http://bit.
ly/2DayCro.
11
Data mining
The information you 
want from this table is under the 
Notes column. This is where 
you’ll find the switches that push 
your graphics card that little bit 
harder, making them better at 
Bitcoin mining.
The important ones are those 
relating to the workload (-w) and 
whether to use vectors (-v). Enter 
these values into the Extra Flags 
block in GUIMiner, stop mining 
and then restart it. 
12
Precision tuning
This should give your 
Bitcoin mining PC’s performance 
a nice boost, but to really get the 
most from your card you need 
to turn your hand to a little 
overclocking.
We recommend grabbing 
EVGA’s Precision X utility (www.
evga.com/precisionx/), although 
you can get quite far using the 
overclocking tools that are part 
of AMD’s Catalyst drivers.
13
Beat the heat
Whether you’re using a specialised ASIC Miner or your 
own rig, the device is going to run very hot when trying to mine 
BTC for you. Therefore, be sure to place your mining hardware 
somewhere with good ventilation so the heat can dissipate 
easily. Generally speaking, the cooler your mining machine, the 
more efficiently it will perform. Be sure to factor in the cost of air 
conditioning and/or a heat pump into your mining calculations 
to be certain you’re still running a profitable enterprise.
If you live somewhere cold, you could follow in the footsteps 
of smart Siberians and use the excess heat from mining as a ‘data 
furnace’ to heat your home.
14
Keep mining profitable
As research continues into specialist mining equipment and the difficulty of mining 
increases, the highest profits from mining are usually earned by data centres based in locations 
where energy is cheap, such as China. As a hobbyist miner, you can maximise your profits by 
following their example by using ASIC miners and keeping electricity costs down.
You can increase the efficiency of your rig by using an efficient PC power supply (PSU). You can 
get help with this in the Pools section of the BitcoinTalk forums (https://bitcointalk.org).
An alternative way to get one over on the ‘big bully’ miners is to use renewable energy to 
power your mining machine – for example by installing solar panels on your property.
If you do this, remember that the advertised wattage for devices is usually the optimal amount 
you’ll receive under ideal conditions. Solar panels in particular are affected not just by the amount 
of sunlight they receive, but by surface area, the angle at which they’re placed, and the direction in 
which they’re facing. Speak to a qualified installer, fully explain your needs, and get things right.
To get started, consider using an electricity usage monitor to measure the energy consumption 
of your mining device in kWh (kilowatt hours). These are very inexpensive and are  available from 
any hardware store.
Remember that the reward for mining Bitcoin halves every 210,000 blocks. You can find a more 
detailed explanation of this on the Bitcoin Wiki, but essentially, this means mining becomes less 
profitable over time, unless you can increase your hash rate – or the value of Bitcoin increases. ■

Uncover the 
mysterious secrets of 
Windows 10 with  
this bumper – and 
essential – collection  
of tips, techniques  
and handy info!
B
elieve it or not, 
but Windows 10  
is now into  
its third year. 
Despite early 
teething troubles, 
something that always been a 
‘feature’ of Windows (think XP 
before Service Pack 1 was 
released), the operating system 
has firmly established itself and 
largely found its feet.
We say largely because it’s just 
had its third major update in the 
form of the Fall Creators Update, 
and that introduced a whole set  
of new problems to get past – 
although Microsoft is working hard 
to iron these out, so hopefully, by 
now, Windows 10 is functioning 
pretty much as it should.
That’s all well and good for 
long-term users, but you may be  
a recent convert to Windows 10, 
taking advantage of the fact that 
Microsoft hasn’t got around to 
charging people to upgrade yet. 
You may also find that certain 
changes made by recent updates 
have caught you unawares. And 
then there’s those age-old 
problems that plague all users too. 
This is where we come in, 
providing you with answers to all 
those commonly asked questions 
about Windows 10 to help navigate 
you through the minefield.
All this and more
Over the next eight pages we’ll 
show you how to tame Cortana, 
prevent Edge from running amok 
and reveal how to take control of 
which notifications you receive.
You’ll find out why a Microsoft 
account is the best way to log 
onto your PC, discover how to get 
System Restore up and running 
again, and customise the Start 
menu. We’ll also reveal how to 
transfer photos from your phone 
to your PC, deal with browser 
hijacks and gain access to the 
Control Panel (where the best 
system settings are still hidden).
Just sit back, get comfortable 
and find out how to take back 
control of Windows 10 and make  
it your best friend.

How do I use Cortana 
to find files on my  
PC rather than the

Cortana aims to be your 
one-stop shop for finding 
everything from files on 
your PC to getting information 
about upcoming events from  
the Internet. Just start typing  
your question into the ‘Ask me

with a list of suggestions – just 
click one to access the relevant 
app, setting or to view the  
results of a web search. It’s not 
immediately apparent, but you can 
also search for files directly from 
Cortana. Type your search terms 
and either click the Documents icon 
at the top of the search window or 
click More to select from a wider 
choice – there’s Music, Photos and 
Videos, plus a Folders option, which 
performs a general file search.

I understand doing so

I ditch my old account

A
Think of your Microsoft 
account as the glue that 
holds all your Windows 
settings, Store purchases and 
other Microsoft services together. 
It’s basically a convenient way 
of using Windows 10 in this 
connected age – one login fits 
all. If you stick with your local 
account details, Windows  
should work fine, but you’ll be 
frequently prompted to provide 
your Microsoft account details 
for other parts of Windows, 
from logging into OneDrive to 
downloading apps from the 
Microsoft Store.
If you use Windows on 
more than one device (say your 
phone, a hybrid tablet and your 
Windows desktop) then signing 
into each with your Microsoft 
account also allows you to 
sync certain settings between 
them (such as your desktop 
background), as part of 
keeping the experience consistent 
across all platforms.

I want to email a

A
Emailing large files can  
clog up people’s Internet 
connections, while some 
services will actually reject email 
attachments over a certain size.  
A better option is to upload the 
file to your cloud account, such  
as OneDrive, then share a link to 
the file with your friend in the 
email. It means the email arrives 
speedily, and they can download 
the file on their own terms by 
clicking the link.
If you’re a OneDrive user, copy 
the file into your OneDrive folder 
in File Explorer, then right-click  
it and choose ‘Share a OneDrive 
link’. A link to the file will be 
copied to your clipboard –  
just open the email and press 
[Ctrl] + [V] to paste the link  
into the body of your mail.

now I’ve upgraded 
to Windows 10,  
how do I protect 
myself from data loss? 
I have many documents 
I need to access for work, 
as well photos I have taken 
on my travels.
A
Windows 10 has not 
one, but two built-in 
backup tools. There’s  
the traditional Windows 
Backup tool from Windows 7, 
which can be used to create 
backups of your data, as well 
as take a full system image of 
your drive. Type ‘backup’ into 
the Cortana search bar and 
choose ‘Backup and Restore 
(Windows 7)’ under Settings 
to access it.
Those migrating from Windows 
8 and 8.1 will be pleased to learn 
the File History backup tool  
is available too – simply choose 
Backup Settings from the same 
‘backup’ search to open it and  
get set up. Follow the prompts  
to set up a drive to back up to, 
then choose ‘More options’ to 
fine-tune settings, including how 
often to back up and which of 
your folders get backed up.
Should you need to restore  
data from your File History 
backup, simply browse to the 
folder in question using File 
Explorer and click History under 
the Home tab on the ribbon. You 
can browse for files to restore, plus 
roll back to earlier versions of files 
too, in case you want to undo a 
recent change. If looking for a 
previous version, you can browse 
through the revisions, previewing 
each one before restoring the 
version you want to bring back. 
One final option is to switch on 
OneDrive – this backs up your files 
to the cloud, giving you access to 
a securely hosted remote backup 
that you can also access on other 
devices and computers.
How do I unzip  
a file on my PC?

Right-click it and choose

do that open the More (…) button 
in the Favourites menu. Scroll 
down in the pane that appears and

If you want to import bookmarks

Does Windows 10 
come with anti-virus 
software installed? If 
so, do I need anything else 
to protect my PC?
A
Windows 10 comes with 
Windows Defender 
pre-installed, but it only 
offers basic protection against 
malware. We’d recommend 
replacing it with a third-party 
tool – if you’re strapped for  
cash, then Panda Free Antivirus 
(www.pandasecurity.com) has  
a better detection rate than 
Windows Defender. Paid-for 
solutions such as Norton and 
Kaspersky also include more  
forms of protection, including 
proactive tools that automatically 
scan downloaded files and 
monitor for suspicious behaviour, 
which might indicate the presence 
of malware not yet known to the 
security software.
We also recommend that you 
add extra layers of security to  
your PC to minimise the risk of 
infection and block adware. 
Install and run regular scans  
with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 
Free (www.malwarebytes.org),  
get extra protection against 
potentially unwanted software 
using Unchecky (www.unchecky.

to help steer you away from

email account. Don’t worry, 
though; the messages are all still 
there if you need access – just  
go to https://mail.live.com in  
your browser if you only need 
occasional access to them.
If this is inconvenient, change 
the Mail sync setting to sync your 
entire mailbox: right-click your

then click ‘Change mailbox sync

to manually reset the home page and search 
settings when you’re done.

If all else fails, try a dedicated removal 
tool such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware

evades your anti-virus software.

A
We’re assuming you get  
as far as the Windows

that Windows keeps freezing, 
throwing up an error message  
or rebooting. If so, you may be 
able to fix things using a Windows 
recovery drive, which you can 
create within Windows itself or  
on another PC. 
Type ‘recovery’ into the 
Cortana search box and click 
‘Create a recovery drive’. If you 
leave ‘Back up system files to the 
recovery drive’ ticked, you may 
be able to reinstall Windows  
from the recovery drive, but it  
will need to be at least 8GB in size 
(as opposed to 512MB for just the 
recovery options). 
Once complete, simply boot from 
this drive to repair or reinstall 
Windows. Look for options to repair 
boot problems, and if you’re lucky 
the automatic tools will do the job. 
If they don’t, and you have a recent 
drive-image backup, consider 
restoring that. 
If you’ve backed up using 
Macrium Reflect Free (see page 18 
or www.techradar.com/1319885),

cater for individuals. You can’t 
have a Microsoft engineer sit there 
and craft you your own custom 
version of Windows (we know, 
we’ve asked), so you need to 
scrape off that additional chaff 
yourself. We’re not just talking 
about shaving away the contents 
of a couple of megabytes of

stacks of software that can reduce 
your machine’s performance or

Doing all this work every time 
you get a new PC would be very

shortfalls. A better Windows for 
your PC of tomorrow. 
Windows doesn’t seem to 
encourage trimming, but a little 
knowledge goes a long way. Our 
sacrificial OS for this guide is the 
latest official ISO of Windows 10 
Home, updated for the Creators 
Update, because (presumably) 
that’s the version most people are 
using; if you’re taking a hammer to 
the Pro version, you might have to 
tease out a few more services, but 
the changes won’t be too extreme.

Although Windows 
10’s interface is 
already a highly 
streamlined affair 
compared to its 
predecessor, it 
could stand to be 
slicker. Let’s begin, with our clean 
Windows install, by making it snappier, 
removing unnecessary elements, and 
making that experience all the better. 
What better place to start than, well, 
Start itself? While we personally love 
the Start menu tiles, you may not be 
such a big fan so how do you get rid?
Windows 10 Pro includes tools such 
as the Group Policy Editor, which can 
help you do away with them quickly, 
but in Windows 10 Home you’re stuck 
with the tedious process of right-
clicking each tile, and selecting ‘Unpin 
from start’. Do this enough times, click 
off the Start menu, and relaunch it, and 
that right side panel disappears 
altogether. Clearing out the main bulk 
of the menu itself, apart from a certain 
selection of Windows’ default apps, is 
again a case of wading in with right-
clicks, and uninstalling. Those apps 
that simply won’t uninstall – the 
monsters – can usually be excised 
using Powershell. See the ‘Ultimate 
Removal’ box (page 63) to find out how 
to remove and, if you’re desperate, 
reinstate them.
There is a host of surface 
personalisation tweaks that you can 
apply to the Start menu and Taskbar 
through the Settings > Personalisation 
menu. You can change the colour by 
first selecting an accent colour in 
Colours, then checking the box to 
apply it to the Start menu, Action 
Centre, and Taskbar. While you’re on 
the same screen, switch off 
transparency effects for a microscopic 
performance boost, then head to the 
Start tab. Because we’re old school, we 
favour switching off everything here to 
make the Start menu a straight 
alphabetised list of apps, but we’re not 
going to say you’re wrong if you like 
having recently used or installed apps 
pushed to the top. Suggested apps, 
though? That can definitely go. At the 
bottom of the page, click ‘Choose 
which folders appear on Start’ to get 
quick links to a bunch of useful features 
on there. Quite why File Explorer and 
its ilk aren’t included by default, 
though, is baffling. 
Basic stuff done, let’s do some more 
intricate tweaking. Open up Control 
Panel > ‘System and Security’ > System 
> ‘Advanced system settings’, then click 
the Advanced tab. Jump into the 
performance settings, and switch off 
everything you can’t stand to lose. 
Since we’re currently here for efficiency, 
not looks, we recommend disabling 
animations, fades, shadows – basically, 
everything bar font smoothing. Save 
your changes, then open up the 
Registry editor for a quick deeper hack. 
Navigate to the ‘HKEY_CURRENT_USER\
Control Panel\Desktop’ key, open up 
the ‘MenuShowDelay’ entry, and 
change its value. A flat zero tends to 
make things a little overcrisp – read: 
impossible to use – but halving the 
number can really make Windows feel a 
lot more responsive. 
Now head back to 
the control panel, 
because it’s time to 
do a little old-school 
scrubbing. Head to 
Programs > 
‘Programs and 
Features’, and select ‘Turn Windows 
features on or off’. The list isn’t over-
extensive, and there’s not much you can 
remove that will leave you with a faster 
PC, but it can prevent some 
annoyances. Drop, for example, Internet 
Explorer 11, because you don’t use it, 
and there’s no sense keeping it around. 
You can also kill off Windows Media 
Player, if that’s not your jam.
Next, let’s improve your boot speed 
by preventing a few things from 
running at startup. Launch the Task

little, it’s a good idea to stop them”

We are, of course, 
working on a clean 
Windows install, 
but you probably 
aren’t. Disabling the 
core Windows 
services – those 
programs that run quietly in the 
background, supplying your PC with 
essential (and inessential) functions 
that don’t require an interface – isn’t 
necessarily recommended; Microsoft’s 
own suite has been honed over the 
years to be as efficient as possible, its 
contents sitting in the pagefile, barely 
ever touching system RAM. You could 
chop out most Windows services and 
never feel a difference on a modern 
machine, apart from the whole 
operating system crumbling around 
your ears. Third-party services, though, 
are a different story, and cutting them 
out means you’re likely to see a real 
change, which (usually) will only impact 
that app’s time to initial launch. 
First up, finding out what’s running. 
The Task Manager is a good place to 
start. Switch to the Advanced view, and 
scroll down to see the entries prefixed 
with the words ‘service host’. These are 
all fired off via svchost.exe, so they’re 
categorised together. Some might 
Manager with [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Esc], and 
head to the Startup tab. Each program 
that’s launched automatically is listed 
with a broad rating of its start time 
impact. If there are components you 
use very little, it’s a good idea to stop 
them; to squash OneDrive’s system-
grinding initial launch time, for 
example, right-click it, and set its status 
to Disabled. For more intricate control, 
Microsoft’s Sysinternals team has long 
published Autoruns (http://bit.
ly/2CKVQo5), a free – and portable – 
add-on that offers access to the same 
management tools as Task Manager, 
plus a whole lot more.
More classic cleaning can be done 
within Windows 10’s Settings screen. 
Microsoft’s love for its Universal apps 
means it presumes you’ll want to use 
them, and are going to want them 
ready at a moment’s notice, running in 
the background at all times. Which may 
be true, but disabling those background 
apps is preferable if you want a 
smoother-running PC. In Privacy > 
Background Apps, you can switch off 
anything you’re happy to just fire off 
manually, which will likely include, well, 
just about everything.
One more quick optimisation, 
whether you’re running a small drive or 
not, would be to clean up temporary 
files, and wash away old versions of 
Windows. This will gain a fraction more 
speed in certain apps if they’re forced 
to grind through cache directories 
before running, but you’re not doing 
this just for speed; you’re doing it for 
cleanliness. Find the drive you want to 
optimise in File Explorer, right-click it 
and select Properties, then seek out 
Disk Cleanup in the General tab. Select 
the categories that you want to kill off, 
and then use ‘Clean up system files’ to 
expunge the lot.
SLASHING
SERVICES
Safe services
There’s a laundry list of 
services that can safely be 
switched from automatic 
to manual for a boost at 
boot time; disabling them 
altogether is a question of 
your preferences, or 
Windows’ ability to hold 
up. Cut Connected User 
services and Telemetry, 
dmwappushsvc, and 
diagnostic Tracking 
service to remove 
Windows’ spying – er, 
telemetry – tendencies, 
then diagnostic Policy 
service, windows Error 
Reporting service, and 
Program Compatibility 
Assistance service to do 
away with a few services 
that you won’t want 
bothering you once 
you’ve started using 
Windows in earnest. You 
can also disable Remote 
Registry just to be a little 
secure, and windows 
defender service – and 
possibly security Centre 
– if you’re confident in 
your own malware-
fighting methods.
A lot of the other 
possibilities will depend 
on the specific makeup of 
your machine. Shut down 
iP Helper if you’re not 
using ipv6, TCP/iP 
netBios Helper if you’re 
not part of a workgroup, 
or distributed Link 
Tracking Client if your 
PC is not on a network at 
all. Kill Print spooler if 
you don’t have a printer, 
windows image 
Acquisition (wiA) if you 
don’t have a scanner,  
Touch Keyboard and 
Handwriting Panel 
service if you don’t have 
a touchscreen, Bluetooth 
support if you haven’t 
already got the idea here, 
and downloaded Maps 
Manager if you never 
use Windows 10’s built-in 
maps app.
You may also wish to 
make a few other services 
manual, without disabling 
them. The three remote 
desktop services are 
optional, and your 
graphics card – or 
possibly sound driver – 
has likely slipped a few in. 
Dropping these to 
manual will improve boot 
time, but probably slow 
the launch of your 
graphics-intensive apps. 
That’s a common theme 
with services: Unless you 
completely disable them, 
you simply delay the, er, 
delay, and disabling is 
rarely the best idea. But 
do experiment, and see 
what works for you.
Removing the Live tiles from the Start menu is as 
simple as a right-click.

You can use Stop to temporarily kill a service and see what effect it has.

contain more than one service, which 
you can discover by clicking the 
expand arrow on the left; and most, 
while not essential, are there to 
improve your Windows experience. A 
quick glance through the list in our 
clean install reveals Superfetch as the 
main culprit for RAM hogging – as it 
should be, given that it’s the service 
that puts commonly accessed data into 
RAM, rather than spending ages 
reading it from the hard drive. Our 
biggest CPU sapper is the usefully 
named Local System, which deals with 
Windows updates. That’s the perfect 
target for now: We know there are no 
updates pending, so we can stop it. 
Clumsily ending the task in Task 
Manager won’t do. Instead, type 
‘services’ into the search bar to open 
the services section of Windows’ 
Management Console. You won’t find 
Local System in the list, but you should 
find the two components we’re 
looking for: Windows Update, and the 
Update Orchestrator service. Right-
click them, select Stop, and they’ll go 
away until your next boot. Those 
sanctions not harsh enough? Right-
click, select Properties, and poke 
around the General tab. Change the 
‘Startup type’ to Disabled, and they 
won’t come back until you dig through 
the list and switch them back on again. 
Be warned, though: Unless Windows is 
happy to do without, this a stupid 
thing to do. Even more stupid – but 
similarly possible – would be to 
remove a Windows service altogether, 
although cutting out a third-party 
service – maybe even a piece of 
malware – is unlikely to sting too much. 
Run the Registry editor by typing 
‘regedit’ into the search bar, then dig 
down to ‘HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/
SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services’. 
Finding the particular service you want 
to kill can be tricky, but click around 
until you find it, then rename (or, ulp, 
delete) its key to get rid.
If you’re installing 
on a new machine, 
there’s no reason 
you have to use 
Microsoft’s stock 
ISO. Installation 
customisation tool 
NTLite actually makes generating a 
stripped-down Windows easier, and it 
means you can arguably do a lot more 
in a lot less time. It’s also a chance to 
NTLite enables you to drop integrated services before Windows is even installed.
BACK 
IN 
TIME

save a bunch of time post-install, as you 
can integrate all the drivers, updates, 
and software you need into your 
custom installer, so it’s there straight 
away. What’s more, it’s a fantastic way 
of cutting down an existing Windows 
installation, as long as you pay for a 
license – although you’ll only be able to 
create your own install image if you’re 
chipping away at an ISO, rather than a 
running system.
Let’s concentrate on trimming a new 
ISO – the live process is no different, 
just a little more narrow. Download the 
software from www.ntlite.com via the 
three-line ‘hamburger’ menu, and run 
through its installer – you can also 
create a portable version of NTLite at 
this point by checking the appropriate 
box, so you can drop it on a USB flash 
drive, and take it from PC to PC if 
necessary. Before you run it, mount 
your Windows ISO (you can download 
one from the Microsoft website, if you 
don’t have one handy) by right-clicking 
the file, and selecting Mount, then copy 
over the files to a writable folder to 
prepare them before unmounting 
again. Open NTLite, click the Add 
button on the ribbon, and point it at 
the folder where you dropped your 
installer files. Pick the version of 
Windows you’re looking to hack, wait 
for it to mount (it may take a couple of 
minutes), then select Components 
below Remove in the left column, and 
accept the dire warning of potential 
doom that appears.
The full list of features available for 
removal is going to be pretty daunting, 
and unless you’re generating a kiosk 
Windows that’s designed to be 
impervious to interference by certain 
means, there’s probably little reason to 
go too crazy here – you can cut out 
some of the same services that you 
might have disabled previously, and 
really trim the size of your ISO by 
excluding support for every piece of 
hardware you know you don’t have. 
You’ll see a bunch of stuff in blue – 
these are components you can’t remove 
unless you pay €40 for a full license. 
Check out the Settings, Services, and 
Extra Services panels, too. The former 
enables you to preconfigure your ISO to 
look and act just as you’d expect, again 
saving you time poking around the 
Settings screen and Control Panel later 
on, while the latter pair gives you full 
control over services, as discussed 
previously. Extra Services, in particular, 
enables you to manipulate a bunch of 
services that would usually be pretty 
inaccessible through Windows itself; 
switching some of these from Boot to 
Manual can boost your PC’s boot time, 
although you won’t know until you 
install your image, so this may be a false 
economy. The Integrate and Automate 
categories are where you include the 
software and drivers that you want to 
integrate into your new ISO – any 
third-party programs and apps you also 
want to install on your refreshed PC 
need to go in the ‘Post-setup’ section. 
When you’re done, use the Apply 
section at the bottom of the list to 
finish everything off. We recommend 
opting for the ‘Save and trim’ option, 
which cuts out everything but the 
specific version of Windows 10 you’ve 
been working on. Since most ISOs 
contain multiple editions, and few 
people have any use for Windows 10 S, 
N, and the like, this is a good way to cut 
down the size of the install image.  
Disabling Windows features is a good idea if 
you’re never going to use them.
Dropping little-used startup apps can lead to 
much faster boot times.

Ultimate removal
Doing Windows your way 
means only including the 
applications you absolutely 
want, using Windows as a 
base for your operations, 
and often completely 
ignoring those apps that 
microsoft doggedly 
protects unwitting users 
from deleting. We’re not 
suggesting they’re useless, 
and sometimes a core 
Windows app might be 
the best choice, but that’s 
for you to decide.  
While the surface parts 
of Windows deny their 
removal, the deeper 
toolbox doesn’t. Fire up 
powershell by right-
clicking the Start button, 
and selecting Windows 
powershell (Admin). Now 
run the command  
Get-AppxPackage 
(capitalisation is important 
in powershell) to list every 
core app that Windows 
has installed. Scroll 
through – it’s probably 
quite a long list – until you 
find the application you’re 
looking for, and seek out 
its full name, which is a 
longer string, including 
version numbers. Then 
just type ‘remove-
AppxPackage <full name>’ 
to strike it from your drive.
one bit of caution here: 
Don’t, whatever you do, 
remove the microsoft 
Store app. While most of 
these apps can be 
reinstalled relatively simply 
if you realise you’ve made 
a mistake, removing the 
microsoft Store removes it 
permanently, and also 
does away with your ability 
to reinstall other core apps. 
Whatever you may think of 
the Windows app pool, the 
Store itself is getting at 
least a bit better these 
days, and you don’t have 
to use it. Just work around 
the fact that it’s still there. 
This may not be an entirely 
permanent exercise, either. 
Future updates are likely to 
reinstall packages that 
you’ve previously 
removed, and add a few 
stubborn newcomers to 
the mix along with them. 
But now you know how to 
remove them, you can 
just go through the 
process afresh when 
major new versions of 
Windows appear.

Q I’m thinking of upgrading to a 
laptop with two drives, one of 
which will be a solid-state drive 
(SSD). What’s the best way to split 
Windows, applications and data 
between these two drives?
chris balinski
matt’s solution
A lot will depend on the 
size of the SSD drive, 
Chris. If it’s 32GB you’ll 
have space for Windows 10 and a 
handful of apps only – but if you 
get a model with 64GB or even 
128GB you should have ample 
room to run all your apps alongside 
Windows, ensuring both load 
swiftly and run responsively. You 
would then use the secondary hard 
drive both to store your data on 
and as a backup for your SSD drive.
One trick is to set up user folders 
– Documents, Pictures, Desktop 
and so on – on your data drive and 
then point Windows to them. 
Create the folders – we suggest 
inside a parent folder named after 
yourself (so D:\Chris\Documents 
and so on), then open File Explorer. 
Under ‘Folders’, right-click each 
folder in turn and choose

WINDOWS DUAL-bOOT
Q I have a dual-boot system 
whereby Windows 10 Pro is 
installed on an m2 SSD drive and 
Windows 10 Home is installed on a 
SATA SSD. Whenever I update 
Windows 10 Home, I then find 
Windows 10 Pro won’t boot and 
the usual start-up repair fails to 
work too, forcing me to restore 
from a system image. Can you 
suggest a fix please?

Q When I run a scan with 
AdwCleaner it always comes 
up with the following: ‘Chromium

Surfing Protection’. I don’t know 
where it is, and it keeps coming

Jim Duncan
Rob’s solution
You could safely ignore 
this – it’s linked to IObit 
software, which is safe 
enough – but Jim had no memory 
of having installed Advanced 
SystemCare, while Firefox was the 
only web browser installed on his 
PC. We kept digging and confirmed 
it was linked to the Chrome web 
browser, which Jim eventually 
remembered having briefly 
installed, suggesting there are 
some leftovers on his PC’s hard 
drive somewhere.
After a bit more research, we 
discovered where the leftovers are 
likely to be: press [Win] + [R] to 
open the Run dialogue box, type 
%LocalAppData% and press [Enter] 
to access the hidden AppData\
Local folder inside your personal 
user folder. From here open a 
Google folder and see if there’s a 
Chrome folder inside – deleting this 
should finally clear the leftover files, 
and AdwCleaner should no longer 
detect the add-on.

FOR PAINT.NET 
Q I’m loving your Paint.NET

plug-ins too. I’ve installed loads, but 
have lost track of what I’ve installed. 
Is there any way that I can keep 
track of them?
Frank Farrell
Nate’s solution
The best tool for the job 
is the Plugin Browser, 
which lists all plug-ins 
– including the 43 bundled with the 
program itself – that have been 
installed. It’s simple to install: visit 
https://forums.getpaint.net and 
navigate to ‘Plugins – Publishing 
ONLY’ and you’ll find it pinned to 
the top of the list. Save the ZIP file 
to your Downloads folder, then 
extract and run the .exe file inside 
– ignore the SmartScreen warning, 
it’s safe to install. 
Once you’ve installed the Plugin 
Browser, click Close, open Paint.NET 
and access it via Effects > Plugin 
Browser where you can browse by 
various criteria. You’ll also see a 
keyword search tool: this can be 
used to search the plug-in index 
online to track down more plug-ins 
– just click a hyperlink to be taken 
to the relevant web page. Plug-ins 
are downloaded as ZIP files, then if 
no installer is provided, you copy 
the .dll file inside the ZIP archive to 
the relevant subfolder – typically 
Effects – inside C:\Program Files\
Paint.NET.  ■

70 How to master the 
Windows 10 desktop 
72 Change the way 
the Start menu works
 

You’ll spend a lot of time there, so here are 
some great ways to make it work for you…
Master the desktop
hen not actually using 
applications, the Windows 
desktop is where you’ll 
spend much of your time, 
moving files about, hunting for that 
obscure application you installed six 
months ago and suddenly need, or 
lining up your windows so that they 
fill the space perfectly (a time-wasting 
pastime that’s all but dead now 
thanks to window snapping).
In Windows 10, the desktop and the 
Taskbar get a few new tricks that 
make working with files and folders 
even easier, and the new search bar 
means pulling up an application you 
don’t use often is a breeze. Follow 
these tips to a happy start…
W
1 Show desktop/peek
The Show Desktop button isn’t marked, and some people 
don’t even know it exists. Press this anonymous section at the 
extreme right of the Taskbar, and all your open windows will 
minimise. Hover the mouse pointer over it, and you’ll get a 
preview ‘peek’ at the desktop that reverts when you move your 
mouse pointer away. It’s very useful when you’ve got a chaotic 
number of windows open on your desktop.
2 Virtual desktops
If you find your desktop frequently getting overcrowded as 
you work, why not offload some of the mess onto another one? 
Click the Task View button to the right of Cortana’s search box on 
the Taskbar, and you’ll be taken to a screen that shows your open 
apps, and also your desktops. Add a new one, or even more, and 
you’ll be able to flick between them with different apps open on 
each. It’s a great way to stay organised on your PC.
4 Window snapping
A real godsend for those who used to tease their window 
edges out until they exactly matched the edge of the screen, 
snapping in Windows 10 enables you to have two or more 
windows open that completely fill their areas of the screen. Pick 
up a window and move it to the extreme left or right edge of the 
desktop to try it (you’ll see it ‘snap’ to the new half screen format). 
You can adjust how much of the screen they take up too.
3 Scroll inactive windows
An annoyance for anyone who’s come to Windows from 
using the Mac, the ability to scroll the window your pointer is 
currently over – instead of the one that’s currently active – is new 
in Windows 10. So, if you have a browser and a word processor 
open, and are reading one while typing in the other, you can now 
scroll down in the browser without having to take your focus 
away from your text document.
70  |  
  |  February 2018

5 Desktop icons
The Windows 10 desktop icons have a pixellated look, and 
if this offends you it’s easy to change them. Luckily, there are icon 
packs available online – including the shinier Windows 8 icons. 
Download the icon pack you want to use, then go to Start > 
Settings > Personalisation > Themes. Click the ‘Desktop icon 
Settings’ and select the icons you want to place on the desktop, 
then use the Change Icon option to change their look.
6 Shake to minimise
This may sound like something left over from a tablet build 
of Windows that needs a built-in accelerometer, but picking up a 
window with your mouse pointer and shaking it back and forth 
will minimise every other window, leaving you with a clear and 
uninterrupted view of the one you want to work with. It’s much 
faster than clicking several minimise buttons, and it’s a fun little 
quirk that’s a good one to remember.
8 Window management
In addition to window snapping, you can arrange your 
windows in some other ways too. Right-click on the Taskbar to 
reveal three window arrangement schemes: ‘Cascade windows’; 
‘Show windows stacked’; and ‘Show windows side by side’. These 
are similar to the Windows menu’s functions that have been 
available all the way back to Windows 3.1, and can make it quick 
and easy to find what you’re looking for.
7 Notifications
The notifications panel – or Action Centre – slides in from 
the right of the screen, with a button in the system tray, and will 
house any messages that apps or Windows components want to 
send you. It’s where you’ll find links to details of Windows updates 
that have been installed on your machine, and any social media 
messages or upcoming calendar events. You can customise it so 
it’s as intrusive as you can deal with.

Welcome to Windows 10 
Master the desktop

The Start menu in Windows 10 is more powerful than 
ever – here are some easy tips to make it work for you
Customise the Start menu
he Start menu’s return was big news 
when Windows 10 launched, and it 
has evolved as the operating system 
has been updated. It’s become a fast, 
and efficient way to access apps and settings – 
Windows 8’s full-screen monstrosity is now a 
distant memory, thankfully!
However, if you don’t like how the Start menu 
looks when you first pop it up on your fresh 
install of Windows 10, it doesn’t have to stay that 
way. It’s fully customisable in ways that were 
never possible in earlier versions of the 
operating system, and can be made to work in 
just about any way you want, standing out from 
its background for ease of reading, or 
automatically blending in with the colour 
scheme of whatever theme you have currently 
set on your desktop.
T
1  
Colour
Your Start menu’s background can be any colour you like 
– all you have to do is untick a box. Open up Settings, then 
Personalisation and finally Colours. Untick the ‘Automatically pick 
an accent colour from my background’ option and you’ll be able 
to pick a colour from the palette. So your Start menu can be a 
contrasting red or yellow rather than a dull blue or grey. Play 
around to find a combination that works for you.
2  
Size
To make space for all the customising you can do to the 
Start menu, you can easily resize it to your liking. Just move your 
mouse pointer to the top-border or right-border of the Start 
Menu, the pointer will change into arrows, and you’ll be able to 
increase or decrease height and width, dragging it out to 
completely fill the screen if you want to. This is particularly useful 
if you have a PC filled with programs that you access regularly.
4 Hide program lists
By default, the Start menu will show you lists of both your 
most used programs and the most recently opened ones. This can 
end up repeating itself, so if you want to get rid of one or the 
other of the lists, or both, open up Settings > Personalisation > 
Start, from where you’ll be able to toggle the lists on or off. You 
can also prevent apps from appearing on the lists so you only get 
a view of the things you really need from day to day.
3  
Folders and tiles
Your Start menu is made up of lists and tiles, and some of 
these can be shortcuts to folders such as Documents. Settings > 
Personalisation > Start enables you to tinker with this, so if you 
never shoot videos you can stop the empty Videos folder from 
taking up space on the menu. You can turn the links to the 
Settings window – and the one that opens an empty File Explorer 
window – on and off too.
72  |  
  |  February 2018

8  
Bring back the Start screen!
It may have been almost universally mocked and reviled in 
Windows 8, but the full-screen Start menu is still there in Windows 
10, ready to block out all your work at a single press of the [Win] 
key! But, if you liked it, go to Settings > Personalisation > Start and 
tick the box marked ‘Use full-screen Start when in the desktop’. 
Note that wording: the Start menu now won’t actually cover up 
your apps like it used to do in Windows 8.
7  
Pin tiles and shortcuts
If there’s something you need to be able to find quickly, but 
which gets lost in the lists of the Start menu, you can pin and 
reposition it so it’s always prominently placed. To do that right-
click an item and choose ‘Pin to Start’. It will now appear in tiles. 
Now click and drag the tile to where to want to move it to. To 
resize the tile, right-click, choose Resize then the tile size you 
want. You can pin shortcuts to the Taskbar for easy access too.
5  
Use it to search with
Hitting the [Win] key on your keyboard to pop up the Start 
menu’s Search box is one of the fastest ways to look for anything 
in Windows 10. Just type a few characters and you will get 
suggestions for applications and documents stored on your 
computer that match your initial query. You can also use the 
arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the Start menu, if you’d 
rather not use the mouse.
6  
Live tiles
Live tiles are tiles that are constantly updated with data, 
usually gleaned over the Internet to make them up-to-date. 
There’s one for the Mail app that shows your most recent 
messages, one for the Weather app that uses your PC’s location to 
tell you what’s going on outside the window, and so on. If you 
find them distracting, you can turn them off by right-clicking 
them and choosing the appropriate option.

This issue’s highlights

I
n a year in which we’ve seen a 
number of remarkable 2-in-1 
laptops, Lenovo has saved the 
best until last with the Yoga 920, its 
follow-up to the fantastic Yoga 910.
The Lenovo Yoga 920 features 
USB-C ports, an improved webcam 
location, a better keyboard and 
boosted battery life, while retaining 
the 360-degree hinge that’s a 
hallmark of the Yoga range.
However with devices, such as 
the Microsoft Surface Book 2, really 
pushing the boundaries of what we 
should expect from 2-in-1s, the 
Yoga 920 has its work cut out if it’s 
to really stand out from the crowd.
Price and availability
As with other 2-in-1 devices, the 
Lenovo Yoga 920 comes in different 
configurations. The base model 
comes with an Intel Core i5-8250U 
processor, a 256GB solid-state drive 
(SSD), 8GB of RAM, a 13.9-inch 
1080p touchscreen and an Active 
Pen stylus for £1,199.99 ($1,199.99).
The second model – which we’re 
testing here – comes with the same 
specs as above, but features a faster 
Intel Core i7-855OU processor and a 
larger 512GB SDD and costs 
£1,349.99 ($1,549.99). And there’s a 
US-only $1,999.99 model, which has 
an Intel Core i7-855OU processor, 
16GB RAM, up to 1TB of storage 
and a 3,840x2,160 Ultra HD screen.
While these are hefty sums, 
they’re not unusual for premium 
laptops and ultrabooks. The Yoga 
920 line-up is also a fair bit cheaper 
than the 13.5-inch Microsoft 
Surface Book 2, which ranges in 
price from £1,499 ($1,499) to £2,999 
($2,999). That’s quite a difference in 
price, though you should note that 
none of the Yoga 920 models come 
with a dedicated graphics card, 
unlike the top-spec Surface Book 2.
Design
When you’re paying a premium 
price you want a device that looks  
and feels premium as well, and 
Lenovo has done an excellent job 
with the Yoga 920. It’s thin, yet 
sturdy, weighing in at 1.37kg and 
measuring 323x223.5x13.95mm.
This means it has a nice heft, 
without feeling heavy or bulky. It 
also has a metallic finish which adds 
to the premium feel, although after 
only a few hours of use it quickly 
becomes a haven for fingerprints. 
The hinges along the back of the 
Yoga 920 are also eye-catching – 
we’ve fluctuated between thinking 
they’re stylish and finding them a 
bit gaudy. There’s no doubting the 
strength and build quality of the 
hinges though, which are essential 
for a convertible laptop since 
they’re likely to see a lot of action as 
you flip the screen orientation.
Like the hinge on the Surface 
Book 2, they’re strong enough to 
angle the screen without the body 
tipping up, while the screen 
remains held in place. Unlike the 
Surface Book 2, however, the 
design of the hinges doesn’t stick 
Lenovo Yoga 920

Another remarkable 2-in-1 laptop
76  |  
  |  February 2018

The integrated graphics of the 
Lenovo Yoga 920 don’t have 
enough power to drive modern 
graphically-demanding games, but 
it can still handle older games – and 
pretty much any title on our list of 
the best games for laptops. For any 
graphically-strenuous tasks, 
however, you may not want to 
settle for the Yoga 920.
Battery
Lenovo claims a battery life of 12 
hours for the Yoga 920, and while it 
didn’t quite reach that target in our 
testing it didn’t fall far short. In our 
movie test the Yoga 920 lasted for 
nine hours and 23 minutes before it 
needed recharging. We also ran the 
PCMark 8 Battery Life benchmark, 
which simulates medium to high 
usage. Here, battery life dropped to 
just over four hours. That’s almost 
two hours less than the Surface 
Book 2 13.5-inch – although the 
Surface Book 2 is both more 
expensive, and actually contains 
two batteries (one in the body, the 
other in the detachable screen). The 
Yoga 920 does recharge very 
quickly via USB-C though, its 
battery taking just 90 minutes to 
reach 92 percent charge.
Summary
The Yoga 920 is a triumph. It has a 
lovely premium design, and 
performs day-to-day tasks well. Its 
integrated graphics mean it’s a little 
weak when it comes to graphically-
intensive tasks, but it’s a price you’ll 
want to pay for a device that’s so 
incredibly thin and light. ■
The Yoga 920 is a premium 2-in-1 
with performance to match – only 
its integrated graphics let it down.
out quite as much, and the screen 
can flip a full 180-degrees.
2-in-1 convertibles that flip their 
screens to turn into a tablet-like 
device struggle to provide quite as 
good a tablet experience as 2-in-1s 
on which the screen detaches from 
the keyboard, since you’re still left 
with a slightly bulky device with a 
keyboard on the back.
Lenovo has partly addressed this 
with the thinness of the design, and 
the keyboard is clever enough to 
turn off the buttons, so they don’t 
interfere when in tablet mode.
Given the design it’s probably no 
surprise that there aren’t a huge 
number of connectivity options. On 
the left side there’s a headphone/
mic jack and two USB-C ports – one 
of which is also used as the power 
supply – and on the right is a 
full-size USB 3.0 port. The number 
of ports isn’t restrictive, and is a 
reasonable trade-off for the svelte 
design. If you have a number of 
USB devices that you want to attach 
you’ll need an adaptor, though the 
Yoga 920 offers Bluetooth as well.
Stylus pros and cons
One thing we criticised the Surface 
Book 2 for was the fact that you’ll 
need to pay extra for the Surface 
Pen stylus, despite the premium 
that Microsoft charges for its 2-in-1. 
Thankfully Lenovo hasn’t followed 
suit and the Yoga 920 comes with a 
battery-powered Active Pen as part 
of the package. The Pen has a nice 
design and the Yoga 920 responds 
well to it, thanks to its screen being 
able to detect 4,096 levels of 
pressure. Light presses and hard 
presses are registered accurately, 
and the Yoga 920 can keep up with 
even the most frantic scribbles.
Performance
The £1,349.99 ($1,549.99) Yoga 920 
we tested is incredibly impressive.
Windows 10 runs smoothly on its 
1.8GHz Intel Core i7, and Lenovo 
has kept the number of unwanted 
pre-installed applications to a 
minimum. Day-to-day tasks are 
usually processed quickly, although 
it took the Yoga 920 quite a long 
time to extract a large ZIP file, 
which also caused its fans to kick in.
The keyboard is large enough to 
type comfortably on, and despite 
the keys being fairly shallow they 
have satisfying travel. The 
touchscreen is also fast and 
responsive, when using either your 
fingers or the stylus, while the 
1080p screen looks fantastic with 
crisp and bright visuals and deep, 
dark blacks, offering an enjoyable 
viewing experience when watching

T
he Razer Blade Stealth is one 
of our favourite ultrabooks, 
and it’s only getting better 
with age. In the middle of 2017, the 
formerly 12.5-inch laptop moved 
up to a larger, 13.3-inch display, 
putting it on an equal footing with 
other notebooks in its category, 
and this latest version sports Intel’s 
latest, 8th-generation Kaby Lake 
Refresh processors, helping it 
deliver its best ever performance.
Price and availability
Starting at around £1,455 ($1,449), 
the Razer Blade Stealth is more 
expensive than it has ever been, 
but that’s partially thanks to its 
elevated specs. Each of the models 
in the range rocks a quad-core Intel 
Core i7 processor with integrated 
Intel UHD graphics, a QHD+ 
(3,200x1,800) resolution display, 
16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.
 
Compare that to the £1,749 
($1,749) asking price of an equally 
well-equipped Dell XPS 13, and the 
Stealth looks like a bargain. Outside 
the US, the Dell XPS 13 also only 
comes with 8GB of memory when 
teamed with the Intel Core 
i7/256GB SKU priced at £1,349. 
If you elect to double your 
storage capacity (an option our 
review unit offers) the Blade Stealth 
further hones its more affordable 
edge over its competitors. The 
configuration here rings up for 
£1,609 ($1,599), whereas Dell 
charges £1,449 ($1,899).
Design
Despite the increase in screen size, 
the 13.3-inch Razer Blade Stealth is 
no larger than its 12.5-inch 
predecessor, maintaining most of 
its original dimensions at 321x206x 
13.8mm. The Kaby Lake Refresh 
update also bumps up the weight 
from 1.33kg to 1.35kg – this is likely 
due to the additional cooling 
needed for the new CPUs.
Aside from the screen bezels, the 
biggest aesthetic change Razer has 
introduced is the new gunmetal 
finish. Synonymous with its name, 
the Stealth has always been the 
Razer’s most understated laptop. 
The new colour adds to that quality.
Gone too are the RGB keyboard 
and light-up lid logo. Instead, the 
gunmetal version features a simpler 
white backlight on the keys. 
Meanwhile, the ‘tone-on-tone’ 
printed triskelion symbol is actually 
hard to miss unless you’re turning 
the laptop from side to side, like 
one of those old holographic prints.
The result is a professional-
looking Razer ultrabook design. 
However, its off-grey paint job still 
sets itself apart from the pack of 
black rectangles in the room. If 
you’d rather have RGB lighting and 
a jet-black look, the regular version 
of the Stealth is also available.
As with previous generations, the 
Blade Stealth comes with potently 
powerful speakers and a large, 
tactile keyboard. What has changed 
this year is that Razer has upgraded

Battery
While we’re seeing performance 
improve year-over-year, the Blade 
Stealth’s battery life has also taken a 
hit with every iteration. The latest 
version ran our movie playback 
battery test for five hours and nine 
minutes, which was shorter than 
the five hours and 25 minutes of 
the previous model – and that was 
already down from the five hours 
and 44 minutes result we saw from 
the 12.5-inch 2016 version.
The blame for these battery life 
decreases are the larger, sharper 
screen and the new quad-core 
processor. The Blade Stealth also 
lags behind its peers for longevity: 
the Dell XPS 13 lasted for a 
remarkable 10 hours and 29 
minutes. Of course, it features a 
lower-resolution screen.
Summary
With its 13.3-inch screen and 
8th-generation Intel processors, the 
Razer Blade Stealth has matured 
into the ultrabook we always 
wanted. The larger display and the 
half-sized bezels make this laptop 
more attractive, while the brighter 
screen and Windows Precision 
Touchpad addressed our other, 
smaller, qualms from last year.
Aside from its battery life, the 
Razer Blade Stealth is on a par with 
other similarly-specced ultrabooks. 
For a reasonable price, it’s as 
well-equipped, and performs as 
well as, most premium offerings 
from Dell, Lenovo or HP. ■
With its vibrant display and 
excellent performance, this is  
an ultrabook for everyone.
its ultrabook with a Windows 
Precision Touchpad.
We didn’t have many complaints 
with the trackpads on previous 
models, but the direct-from-
Microsoft drivers offer even better 
tracking and multi-touch gesture 
recognition. So, we’ll take the 
improvement on the laptop’s 
pointing device even if we felt it 
wasn’t absolutely necessary.
Performance
It’s remarkable that Razer has 
squeezed in a bigger display 
without making the laptop any 
larger. It’s done this by reducing the 
size of the bezels on all sides by 50 
percent, making them barely more 
than a centimetre wide.
On top of the added screen real 
estate, the Razer Blade Stealth 
features a sharper 3,200x1,800-
resolution panel that’s sits above 
the previous default 2,560x1,440 
display. Unfortunately, there’s no 
option of getting a 4K display on 
this ultrabook other than going 
with the older, 12.5-inch model.
To our eye, the QHD+ screen on 
the latest Razer Blade Stealth 
resolves plenty of detail as is, and 
we don’t really miss having an Ultra 
HD resolution on a screen this 
small. The new display also boasts 
100 percent sRGB colour coverage 
and up to 400 nits of brightness. 
We can confirm that the screen is 
much brighter now, outshining 
even rays of sunlight streaking 
through our office windows. Razer’s 
IGZO displays have never lacked in 
colour rendition, and the added 
colour depth helps the screen 
resolve more distinct shades.
Quad-core Kaby Lake Refresh 
processors have helped the Razer 
Blade Stealth make a huge leap in 
performance. While it’s a given that 
more cores usually lead to better 
performance, its benchmark 
numbers are impressive. For 
starters, the 8th-generation Intel 
processors deliver a more than 75 
percent increase in multi-core 
performance compared to 7th-gen 
Kaby Lake. This in turn leads to 
correspondingly higher scores in 
Cinebench and PCMark 8. 
What’s most surprising are the 
graphical enhancements that Intel 
UHD Graphics brings, going by the 
four percent to nine percent 
improvement in its 3DMark scores.
You can fire up Overwatch on the 
Razer Blade Stealth for a smoother 
gaming experience with higher 
frames per second, but you’ll still 
be relegated to playing the game at 
awfully low settings. And that 
pretty much goes for most games 
you try to play on this ultrabook.

itdefender Box 2 is a smart 
home security appliance that 
shields PCs, mobiles, tablets 
and other connected devices from 
hackers, malware and more.
The Box is essentially a 
supercharged router that can 
replace or run alongside your 
existing networking kit. Connect 
your devices to the Box and it acts 
as a sort of firewall, watching 
inbound connections to keep 
hackers at bay. Your network is 
constantly monitored for unknown 
devices or suspect behaviour, and 
the Bitdefender Box also blocks 
outgoing requests to known 
malicious websites.
The Box is powered by a 
dual-core ARM Cortex A9 CPU, with 
1GB of DDR3 RAM and 4GB of 
internal storage. Wi-Fi duties are 
handled by an 802.11ac AC1900 
setup. You get just two ports – one 
LAN, one WAN – both supporting 
Gigabit Ethernet. It’s not quite up to 
the standard of Norton Core’s 4x4 
MU-MIMO system, but there will be 
enough power for most users. 
The Box is only available in the 
US at the time of writing (other 
countries are ‘coming soon’), and 
that’s probably why our review unit 
came with a two-pin power plug. 
This accepts 100-240V input, 
however, so can be used in the UK 
and elsewhere with an adaptor.
The Bitdefender Box costs 
$249.99 (£200) for year one, which 
gets you the router and a free 
one-year subscription to 
Bitdefender Total Security 2018, or 
the equivalent software for your 
device. Buying the software alone 
would normally cost from £35 for 
up to five devices, but the Box 
subscription covers as many as you 
need. Renewing your subscription 
costs $99 (£80) a year.
While Box isn’t exactly cheap, it’s 
competitive with similar products. 
Norton’s Core has the same upfront 
cost at $249.99 (£200), and also 
includes software for unlimited 
devices and renews at $10 (£8) a 
month, or $120 (£96) a year.
Setup
The Bitdefender Box is a simple 
cream and black triangular block 
with a power connection and a 
couple of Ethernet ports. No one’s 
going to marvel at the design, but 
it’s good enough, and won’t look 
out of place in most homes.
Networking newbies will 
probably be intimidated by the 
lengthy instructions on the setup 
card, but it can be easier to get 
going than you think. 
The process starts with you 
downloading the free Bitdefender 
Central app for iOS or Android, 
which is used to manage any 
existing Bitdefender installations 
you might have, and includes a Box 
activation wizard.
Setup starts by asking you to log 
in to the Box network on your 
phone, then connect your Box to 
the Internet, typically by plugging it

connected to your network 
recently, gives you more 
information about them and 
provides some handy extra tools.
This status display doesn’t always 
work as expected. It regularly told 
us devices were ‘disconnected’ and 
hadn’t been seen for some time, 
even when we were using them to 
access the web. This happened on 
both a Windows 10 laptop and an 
Android phone, suggesting it 
wasn’t a device setup issue.
These status issues don’t seem to 
affect what the Bitdefender Box can 
do, fortunately. We were able to 
click a device, find out more about 
it, and pause/resume its Internet 
access with a simple click.
The Box comes with simple 
parental controls that can block 
websites by content or restrict 
Internet access by time of day. The 
ability to block a specific device’s 
Internet access on demand could 
also be handy for those ad hoc 
‘stop what you’re doing and come 
here right now’ situations. There’s 
nothing surprising or revolutionary 
here, but the features are still a 
worthwhile addition.
We completed our checks by 
running simple performance tests, 
including streaming HD video 
content from three devices 
simultaneously. As we’d expect 
from the level of hardware used by 
Bitdefender Box, there were no 
issues and our systems worked 
much as they did with the original 
ISP router.
Summary
The Bitdefender Box can take some 
time, thought and experience to set 
up,  but once it’s working it does an 
excellent job of protecting you 
from a host of security threats. ■
Setup can be complex, but once 
it’s configured the Box will help 
keep your connected devices safe.
into your standard router with the 
1m Ethernet cable provided.
The app offers a choice of 
networking modes. The Box can 
replace an ISP router, work with an 
existing router by enabling bridge/
AP mode, or can be used as a 
standalone router. The last step 
requires disabling your original 
wireless network to ensure any 
devices reconnect to the Box. The 
app includes instructions to work 
with four common US router types 
– AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner, 
Verizon – but UK ISPs aren’t listed.
This isn’t Bitdefender’s fault, since 
our review unit was a US rather 
than a UK model – and if you’re 
used to setting up network gear, 
you should still be able to disable 
the original wireless network on 
your own. But even if you’re not, it 
shouldn’t stop you from getting 
started; you can connect devices to 
the Box network right away and 
sort out your old router later.
If you do experience problems, 
Bitdefender will do its best to help, 
with free installation assistance via 
telephone or email. We tested the 
email route and got friendly and 
helpful replies within two to three 
hours. This should help you solve 
most issues, but if all else fails, 
return the unit within 30 days and 
you’ll get your money back.
Performance
Setup can be a hassle, but once it’s 
done you can use the Box without 
doing anything else at all. Restart 
each of your devices, and they 
should connect to the Box and the 
Internet exactly as they did before. 
Even at this level, there’s plenty 
happening in the background. The 
Box is monitoring outgoing 
connections, blocking attempts to 
access malicious websites, and also 
preventing the sending of sensitive 
information like credit card details 
over unencrypted connections.
The Box also watches for dubious 
incoming connections. New 
devices won’t be able to access the 
network until you give permission, 
and Box prevents any brute-force 
attempts to log in to your devices.
More general network 
monitoring layers detect and alert 
you to network vulnerabilities, as 
well as picking up behaviours, that 
might indicate a hacked device.
There’s no clear way to test most 
of these, but we have measured 
Bitdefender’s anti-phishing systems 
in previous reviews, and they 
perform very well. That protection 
alone is well worth having.
Your Box is managed from the 
Bitdefender Central app. Its Devices

A
round ten years ago, the 
computing world was 
obsessed with the idea of 
ultra-mobile PCs (UMPCs). Although 
there were some impressive 
devices for the time (the Sony Vaio 
and Toshiba Libretto, for example), 
the reality was that the technology 
wasn’t available to make the 
machines viable for most users.
The small screens were low 
resolution and low quality, 
processors were power hungry and 
ran hot and, most importantly, 
battery technology meant an hour 
or two of runtime at best. Now 
technology has moved on and it’s 
much more feasible to create tiny 
PCs, but we don’t tend to see them 
– smartphones and tablet PCs more 
commonly fulfil that need.
A relatively unknown Chinese 
company is looking to change that, 
with the GPD Pocket mini PC. The 
GPD Pocket was initially launched 
on crowdfunding site Indiegogo. 
The campaign not only hit 1,516 
percent of its funding target with 
$3.5 million (around £2.6 million) 
raised, but the firm in question – 
GPD – was also able to build upon 
previous experience manufacturing 
these types of devices to bring the 
Pocket to fruition. Its previous 
product, the GPD Win, was a 
popular 5.5-inch Windows-based 
gaming machine.
Before we dive into the details, 
it’s important to understand that 
devices of this type are about 
compromises. It’s not possible to 
cram a top-end desktop PC into a 
tiny chassis, but the key to making a 
successful product is compromising 
in the right places so as to provide a 
good overall experience. So has 
GPD made the right calls here?
Performance
At the heart of the Pocket sits the 
Intel Atom x7-Z8750 processor with 
integrated HD 405 graphics. While 
your immediate reaction may be to 
balk at the mention of an Atom 
processor, it’s worth noting that the 
Z8750 is a quad-core, 64-bit CPU 
from the Cherry Trail family, built on 
the 14nm process with a base 
1.6GHz clock speed and burstable 
2.56GHz max. Backed by 2MB of 
on-board cache, the processor 
proves impressively capable, 
particularly for a 2W part.
Performance is also helped by 
8GB of LPDDR3-1600 memory and 
128GB of storage (albeit eMMC 
rather than SSD). The balance 
between capability and efficiency is 
spot on – although claimed battery 
life is 12 hours, this is more like 
seven hours in reality, which is still 
extremely impressive.
The GPD Pocket’s display is also a 
particular highlight. The 7-inch 
1,920x1,200 (16:10 aspect ratio) 
screen packs 323 pixels per inch 
(ppi) and is impressively sharp with 
responsive multi-touch. The top 
and bottom bezels are tiny, while 
the side bezels are larger to 
facilitate space for the keyboard.

  |  February 2018

The GPD Pocket isn’t perfect, but 
it compromises in the right places 
to make it a praiseworthy UMPC.
Unusually, the Pocket doesn’t 
include any sort of camera at all, so 
video calls are out of the question. 
Selecting the right hardware might 
be the simple part of the equation 
when compared to getting the 
keyboard right. There’s no avoiding 
the fact that there’s not a lot of 
space for a full keyboard, so input 
on the Pocket will take time to get 
used to. The layout is somewhat 
shifted to the left, some of the key 
sizes are a little unusual and, of 
course, things are more cramped 
than on a conventional QWERTY.
Luckily, the keys have plenty of 
travel and are responsive – after a 
few hours, you’ll be surprised by 
how good the Pocket is to use.
A healthy array of ports provide 
excellent connectivity – charging is 
via the USB Type-C port and USB 
Type A is still present. A 3.5mm 
headphone jack is included, as is a 
micro-HDMI port so you can use 
the Pocket to power a larger screen.
Summary
The GPD Pocket is a compromise – 
ultra-mobile PCs like this always will 
be – but it’s done well. As a full PC 
experience you can fit in your 
jacket pocket, nothing else really 
comes close. Windows on ARM will 
drive new devices in this form 
factor, though, so the market is set 
to explode in the near future. ■

iberty Shield is a UK-based 
proxy and VPN provider, which 
offers the usual range of 
software clients, along with a 
preconfigured router, both of which 
give you access to the same small 
network of eight locations: the UK, 
US, Ireland, Germany, Canada, 
Spain, France and Switzerland.
Liberty Shield claims to offer 
‘superfast Tier 2 network speed 
with sophisticated routing to help 
ensure zero buffering with video 
streaming’, and can also unblock 
Netflix among many other services 
that might be geo-blocked due to 
their location.
Its VPN Router is a customised 
version of the popular MikroTik hAP 
Lite box, which comes with five 
10/100Mbps Ethernet ports, 
dual-chain 802.11b/g/n 2.4GHz 
Wi-Fi, single-chain 802.11ac 5GHz 
Wi-Fi, and a USB port for 3G/4G 
modems. There’s more detail on 
the MicroTik website (http://bit.
ly/2AyfqTo) if you need it.
The starting price is attractive at 
£29.99 ($37.50) which includes your 
choice of power supply (UK, EU, US), 
free UK shipping for the router and 
one month of VPN access.
Subscription prices are relatively 
high, though, ranging from £6.99 
($8.75) per month to an equivalent 
£5.83 ($7.30) for the annual plan. 
Liberty Shield’s VPN Router still 
seems reasonably cheap for the 
first year, but after that it begins to 
look relatively costly.
There’s some compensation in 
Liberty Shield’s UK-based customer 
support, which is open from 9am to 
9pm, seven days a week, and 
includes live chat, email, support 
tickets, and even an option to 
schedule a call-back.
We tested the chat service and 
got a helpful and friendly response 
in less than a minute. It’s wise to be 
skeptical of web reviews, but 
reports on Trustpilot consistently 
praise Liberty Shield for its 
customer support. 
Support matters, too, especially 
with a VPN router where you might 
add new devices. If you’re not the 
technical type, then spending £20 
($27) more a year to help solve 
these problems is a good deal.
Privacy
Liberty Shield makes apparently 
definitive statements about privacy, 
including: “We never share your 
data with anyone and don’t log 
your website usage through our 
servers in any form”. There is some 
scope for session logging, as its 
privacy policy goes on to explain:
“…We may collect the following 
information: times when connected 
to our service, choice of server 
location, and the total amount of 
data transferred per day…”
This is vague, and not ideal, but 
it’s also not unusual; many VPN 
providers do something similar.
We browsed the small print, too, 
but didn’t find anything unusual. 
It’s the usual stuff: don’t do

connection method (VPN or Proxy), 
save the results, turn your router 
off, wait a couple of minutes, turn it 
on and wait for it to reconnect.
The web console offers a few 
other connection settings – 
protocol, Wi-Fi SSID and password 
– but nothing like the power or 
configurability you’d get with a 
standalone router.
We started our tests using a 
wired connection. Our router was 
initially set to use our nearest UK 
server, and this delivered solid 
results, with download speeds 
ranging from 52-58Mbps on a 
75Mbps connection. Switching to a 
wired connection showed no real 
difference on our laptop, which 
managed to max out its wireless 
adaptor at around 44Mbps.
Our mobile saw a dramatic drop 
in performance from around 
50Mbps when connecting to our 
regular router, to more like 25Mbps 
when using Liberty Shield. That 
was unexpected, but as this isn’t an 
issue that affected other devices, 
we didn’t count it as a significant 
black mark against the product.
Switching our location to 
Germany saw speeds fall to around 
20-30Mbps on a wired connection, 
around what we would expect 
from a regular VPN. UK-US 
connections were inconsistent and 
relatively disappointing, ranging 
anywhere from 6-20Mbps.
We visited a few geo-blocked 
sites, and found Liberty Shield 
accessed them without difficulty. 
There’s no guarantee that this 
situation will last, but at the time of 
writing, the service works well. ■

copyright, don’t be a spammer –

Performance
The Liberty Shield VPN Router 
arrives in a surprisingly small box, 
yet still contains everything you 
need: router, power supply, a 0.25m 
Ethernet cable, a Quick Start guide 
and a card with an allocated login 
name and password.
The Quick Start guide started off 
well: Plug one end of the router 
cable into the VPN box, the other 
into your regular router, plug in the 
power cable and wait for it to 
connect to the Internet. Easy.
Unfortunately, the guide didn’t 
tell us what to do next. Should we 
look for an SSID and try to connect? 
Access the router from a browser? 
Do something else? After spending 
a few minutes exploring our 
options, we checked the web 
version of the guide and spotted 
the problem. We weren’t missing 
anything; the printed setup guide, 
left out the most crucial line of all:
“To begin the activation process 
please visit https://www.
libertyshield.com/activate and 
enter the SSID and Code from the 
front page of your booklet”.
We headed off to the activation 
page, where a form asked us to 
enter the login credentials provided 
with the router. We also had to 
provide our name and email 
address to create a Liberty Shield 
account, and enter the details of 
the card that would be used for 
payment. (The first month is free,

Moments after submitting the

that our router was now activated

tablet, phone and TV by entering 
our allocated wireless password.
By default, our router connected 
us to a UK VPN server. You can 
change this, but it takes a little

Wireless in-ears
The age of earphone wires is over. Welcome to the wireless 
Bluetooth revolution and a new era of audio flexibility
3 Avanca Minim
£89, avancaproducts.com
Minim is a good name – these things are 
tiny. Their miniscule size and highly 
reasonable price belies the quality of 
their sound, too. it’s a little muddy in the 
bottom end but tremendously listenable, 
and while they lack the extra features of 
pricier buds, as a basic pair – either of 
which can operate as the lead ear – 
they’re perfectly decent. Battery life isn’t 
the best, and their Bluetooth connection 
isn’t the strongest, so you may need to 
rethink your phone’s pocket position to 
get the best out of them, but at this price 
you can get two pairs!
.
1 Bragi Dash Pro 35X
£349, bragi.com
There’s little the Dash Pro buds don’t do. 
They’re fitness trackers, with heart-rate 
sensing built in. The gyroscopes give you 
head-gesture control and the potential 
for interaction just by tapping your face. 
each touch-sensitive bud responds to 
swipes and presses; you can store up to 
4GB of music and the mic gives rise to a 
clear transparency mode, smart assistant 
integration and even (wonky) live 
translation. Feature-packed, then: shame 
the fairly flat sound quality, with a rough 
bottom end and an unexciting treble, 
lets them down a little.
2 Apple EarPods
£159, apple.com/uk
at once the most compact design and 
the most conspicuous on test, apple’s 
flagship wireless buds almost exactly ape 
the design of its wired staples. They’re 
plenty clever – with extra customisable 
functions open to owners of an apple 
device – and five-hours charge. They’re 
far from the best, though; given the lack 
of any silicone or foam, sound is clear but 
only passable; they don’t block a lot of 
outside sound; and the stalk-mounted 
mic is a magnet for wind noise. The 
airPods may have led the charge, but 
they’re struggling to keep up.

6 Jabra Elite Sport
£229, jabra.co.uk
although they’re not the most 
comfortable buds, the snug ear-hooking 
design of the elite sports is necessary to 
accommodate their heart-rate sensing 
and fitness-tracking capabilities. This is 
much more than just a pair of wireless 
earphones, then, and the app can guide 
you through workouts too, though it 
takes a good amount of training before 
it knows exactly what you need. What’s 
more, they sound absolutely excellent, 
although the foam tips absorb sweat, so 
you’ll want to use the rubberised ear 
hooks when you’re working hard. 
4 B&O Beoplay E8
£259, beoplay.com
no question about it: these small, 
well-designed (and expensive) earbuds 
sound the absolute best of all the devices 
in this line-up. They’re astonishing, 
offering a rich soundstage which reaches 
all the way to sub-bass levels without any 
frequency clouding the others. a 
triumph of hardware engineering in a 
comfortable, clever package, with 
tweakable audio and customisable levels 
of transparency if that’s your thing. The 
app needs a little work on stability, and 
the transparency mode can sound 
robotic, but these are small gripes.
5 Optoma  
NuForce BE Free8
£199, optoma.co.uk
if you have larger ear canals, you’ll need 
to supply your own tips for these buds – 
the selection in the box are all on the 
small side – but once you do, the Free8’s 
quality of sound shines through. Massive 
(but not overwhelming) bass, a relatively 
sound middle, crispy top end, with a 
solid battery life and a decent left-ear 
mic. However, the glossy black plastic 
design isn’t the most attractive, there are 
no media controls, and there’s a constant 
background hiss when playing audio.
ruly wireless earphones 
are in their infancy, and 
that’s exciting. every 
company that’s birthed a 
set of buds has added their own 
genetics: connection methods, 
features, buttons, charging cases – 
T
all differ. There’s no standard yet. 
But there are plenty of ideas and, 
depending on which way your money 
goes, the potential for a huge range 
of functionality. 
The best entries in this first 
generation will define the look and 
sound of the next. Perhaps we’ve 
been critical in this six-way 
smackdown, but that’s only because 
we see what wireless earphones 
could become – and that every 
current entry, for all their individual 
merits, has a kink or two to iron out.
Winner!

Powerful and adaptable, GIMP 
is the best free Photoshop 
alternative. With layers, masks, 
advanced filters, colour 
adjustment and transformations 
– all of which are customisable – 
its feature set is unbeatable.
1 GIMP
www.gimp.org
RATING
One of GIMP’s best features is its 
wealth of user-created plug-ins 
and scripts, many of which come 
pre-installed. Some of these 
replicate Photoshop tools and 
there’s a package of animation 
tools for bringing your photos to 
life. You can also add Photoshop 
plug-ins to GIMP.
If this all sounds intimidating, 
don’t worry – GIMP’s excellent 
user manual includes step-by-step 
tutorials and troubleshooting 
guides to get you started.
The latest version of GIMP has a 
new interface that puts all of its 
toolboxes, palettes and menus 
together in one window, though 
its extensive patchwork of 
user-created tools means you’ll 
have to spend a little time 
experimenting and perusing the 
documentation to learn how to 
get the best results from each one.
RATING
If you haven’t heard of Photo Pos 
Pro, you’re in for a treat. This free 
Photoshop alternative aims to give 
the best of both worlds, offering 
interfaces for both novice and 
advanced users. The novice option 
places one-click filters and 
automatic adjustments to the fore, 
while the latter closely resembles 
Photoshop. Both are well 
designed, and more intuitive than 
GIMP’s endless lists and menus.
Photo Pos Pro offers both layers 
and layer masks, as well as clone 
and healing brushes. All of the 
expected colour-refining tools are 
present. There’s support for batch-
editing and scripts to save time on 
routine tasks, you can also import 
images from a scanner or camera. 
Plug-ins are available in the form 
of frames and templates, and you 
can create your own filters.
The main drawback of the free 
version is a limitation on the size 
of the images you can save – a 
restriction that’s removed from 
the affordable, and even more 
capable, Premium version.
GIMP is a flexible, 
feature-packed 
photo editor that’s 
the closest you can 
get to Photoshop.

Photoshop alternative Paint.NET 
started life as a substitute for 
Microsoft Paint, but over the years 
it’s grown into a powerful photo 
editor in its own right.
3 Paint.NET
www.getpaint.net/
Paint.NET offers an excellent 
selection of automatic filters, plus 
manual editing tools for fine 
adjustments. It also supports 
layers, though you’ll need to 
install a plug-in for masks. Batch 
editing is included by default, and 
its clone stamp makes it easy to 
erase blemishes and distractions.
Paint.NET isn’t as feature-rich as 
GIMP, but its smaller community 
of volunteer coders means its 
interface is more consistent and 
easier to use overall (though not 
as slick as Photo Pos Pro).
Paint.NET is a particularly good 
Photoshop alternative for working 
with multiple photos thanks to 
quick-access tabs that use 
thumbnails to represent each 
open image at a glance.
It’s also very fast, and runs well 
even on low-powered PCs.
Pixlr is the work of AutoDesk, one 
of the biggest names in computer-
aided design and 3D modelling 
software, and is as impressive as 
its pedigree implies. 
4 Pixlr Editor
https://pixlr.com/editor/
RATING
The web version of the app, 
featured here, gives you all of the 
expected Photoshop-style tools, 
as well as artistic filters and 
automatic optimisation options.
Pixlr Editor also gives you a 
toolbox very much like GIMP’s, 
with brushes, fills, selection, 
healing and clone stamp tools. 
There’s support for both layers 
and masks, and although Pixlr 
Editor can’t edit pictures in 
batches, it will handle multiple 
images at once in different tabs.
Sound too good to be true? In 
2015, Autodesk announced it was 
working on an HTML5 version of 
its photo editor Pixlr Express – and 
since Pixlr Editor is built in Flash it 
may not be long for this world.
For now, though, it’s a truly 
excellent Photoshop alternative.
RATING
Plug-in support 
gives Paint.NET 
almost unlimited 
potential, and it 
works very well.
Pixar Editor is such 
a brilliant tool, it’s 
hard to believe it’s 
a web app running 
in your browser.
