Preface to the Second Edition
The first edition of this single-author, two-book set was published in 2006. Since then, electric energy, 
“produced” mostly via electric generators, has become one of the foremost activities in our global econ-
omy world. The subject of Electric Generators (Synchronous Generators and Variable Speed Generators 
as two books) attracted special attention worldwide both from industry and academia in the last decade. 
Electric generators’ design and control may constitute a new graduate course in universities with electric 
power programs.
Also, in the design and control of electric generators for applications ranging from energy conversion 
to electric vehicles (transportation) and auxiliary power sources, new knowledge and developments 
have been published in the last ten years. In the last ten years, in wind generators alone, the installed 
power has increased from some 40,000 MW to 300,000 MW (in 2014).
In view of these developments, we decided to come up with a new edition that
•)>> Keeps the structure of the first edition to avoid confusion for users
•)>> Keeps the style with many numerical worked-out examples of practical interest, together with 
more complete case studies
•)>> Includes text and number corrections
•)>> Adds quite a few new paragraphs in both books, totaling around 100 pages, to illustrate syntheti-
cally the progress in the field in the last decade
The new additions in the second edition are

Preface to the First Edition
Electric energy is a key factor for civilization. Natural (fossil) fuels such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear 
fuel are fired to produce heat in a combustor and then the thermal energy is converted into mechanical 
energy in a turbine (prime mover). The turbine drives an electric generator to produce electric energy. 
Water potential and kinetic and wind energy are also converted to mechanical energy in prime movers 
(turbine) to drive an electric generator.
All primary energy resources are limited, and they have a thermal and chemical (pollutant) effect on 
the environment.
Currently, much of electric energy is produced in constant-speed-regulated synchronous generators 
that deliver electric energy with constant AC voltage and frequency into regional and national electric 
power systems, which further transport and distribute it to consumers.
In an effort to reduce environment effects, electric energy markets have been recently made more 
open, and more flexible distributed electric power systems have emerged. The introduction of distrib-
uted power systems is leading to an increased diversity and growth of a wider range power/unit electric 
energy suppliers. Stability, quick and efficient delivery, and control of electric power in such distributed 
systems require some degree of power electronics control to allow lower speed for lower power in electric 
generators to tap the primary fuel energy.
This is how variable-speed electric generators have come into play recently [up to 400 (300) MVA/
unit], as for example, pump storage wound-rotor induction generators/motors have been in used since 
1996 in Japan and since 2004 in Germany.
This book deals in depth with both constant- and variable-speed generator systems that operate in 
stand-alone and power grid modes.
Chapters have been devoted to topologies, steady-state modeling and performance characteristics, 
transients modeling, control, design, and testing, and the most representative and recently proposed 
standard electric generator systems.
The book contains most parameter expressions and models required for full modeling, design, and 
control, with numerous case studies and results from the literature to enforce the understanding of the 
art of electric generators by senior undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and, especially, indus-
trial engineers who investigate, design, control, test, and exploit electric generators for higher energy 
conversion ratios and better control. This 20-chapter book represents the author’s unitary view of the 
multifacets of electric ­generators with recent developments included.
Chapter 1 introduces energy resources and fundamental solutions for electric energy conversion 
problems and their merits and demerits in terms of efficiency and environmental effects. In Chapter 2, 
a broad classification and principles of various electric generator topologies with their power ratings 
and main applications are presented. Constant-speed-synchronous generators (SGs) and variable-speed 
wound-rotor induction generators (WRIGs); cage rotor induction generators (CRIGs); claw pole rotors; 
induction; PM-assisted synchronous, switched reluctance generators (SRGs) for vehicular and other 

xvi
Preface to the First Edition
applications; PM synchronous generators (PMSGs); transverse flux (TF); and flux reversal (FR) PMSGs, 
and, finally, linear motion PM alternators are all included.
Chapter 3 treats the main prime movers for electric generators from topologies to basic performance 
equations and practical dynamic models and transfer functions.
Steam, gas, hydraulic, and wind turbines and internal combustion (standard, Stirling, and diesel) 
engines are dealt with. Their transfer functions are used in subsequent chapters for speed control in 
­corroboration with electric generator power flow control.
Chapters 4 through 8 deal with SGs steady state, transients, control, design, and testing with plenty of 
numerical examples and sample results that cover the subject comprehensively.
This part of the book is dedicated to electric machines and power systems professionals  and industries.
Chapters 9 through 11 deal with WRIGs that have a bidirectional rotor connected AC–AC partial 
rating PWM converter for variable-speed operation in stand-alone and power grid modes. Steady-state 
transients (Chapter 9), vector and direct power control (Chapter 10), and design and testing (Chapter 11) 
are treated in detail with plenty of applications and digital simulation and test results to facilitate in-
depth assessment of WRIG systems currently built from 1 MVA to 400 MVA per unit.
Chapters 12 and 13 discuss cage rotor induction generators (CRIG) in self-excited modes used as 
power grid and stand-alone applications with small speed regulation by a prime mover (Chapter 12) 
or with full-rating PWM converters connected to a stator and wide-variable speed (Chapter 13) with 
± 100% active and reactive power control and constant (or controlled) output frequency and voltage in 
both power grid and stand-alone operations.
Chapters 9 through 13 are targeted to wind, hydro, and, in general, to distributed renewable power 
system professionals and industries.
Chapters 14 through 17 deal with representative electric generator systems proposed recently for 
integrated starter alternators (ISAs) on automobiles and aircraft, all operating at variable speed with 
full power ratings electronics control. Standard (and recently improved) claw pole rotor alternators 
(Chapter 14), induction (Chapter 15), PM-assisted synchronous (Chapter 16), and switched reluctance 
(Chapter 17) ISAs are discussed thoroughly. Again, with numerous applications and results, from topol-
ogies, steady state, and transients performance, from modeling to control design and testing for the very 
challenging speed range constant power requirements (up to 12 to 1) typical to ISA. ISAs have reached 
the markets, used on a mass-produced (since 2004) hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) for notably higher 
mileage and less pollution, especially for urban transport.
This part of the book (Chapters 14 through 17) is targeted at automotive and aircraft professionals and 
industries.
Chapter 18 deals extensively with radial and axial air gaps, surfaces, and interior PM rotor permanent 
magnet synchronous generators that work at variable speed and make use of full power rating electron-
ics control. This chapter includes basic topologies, thorough field and circuit modeling, losses, perfor-
mance characteristics, dynamic models, and bidirectional AC–AC PWM power electronics control in 
power grid and in stand-alone applications with constant DC output voltage at variable speed. Design 
and testing issues are included, and case studies are treated using numerical examples and transient 
performance illustrations.
This chapter is directed at professionals interested in wind and hydraulic energy conversion, genera-
tor set (stand-alone) with power/unit up to 3–5 MW (from 10 rpm to 15 krpm) and 150 kW at 80 krpm 
(or more).
Chapter 19 investigates with numerous case study designs two high-torque density PM synchronous 
generators (transverse flux [TFG] and flux reversal [FRG]), introduced in the last two decades that take 
advantage of non-overlapping multipole stator coils. They are characterized by lower copper losses/N m 
and kg/N m and find applications in very-low-speed (down to 10 rpm or so) wind and hydraulic turbine 
direct and transmission drives, and medium-speed automotive starter-alternators.
Chapter 20 investigates linear reciprocating and linear progressive motion alternators. Linear recip-
rocating PMSGs (driven by Stirling free-piston engines) have been introduced (up to 350 W) and are 

xvii
Preface to the First Edition
currently used  for NASA’s deep-mission generators that require fail-proof operation for 50,000 h. Linear 
reciprocating PMSGs are also pursued aggressively as electric generators for series (full electric propul-
sion) vehicles for power up to 50 kW or more; finally, they are being proposed for combined electric 
(1 kW or more) and thermal energy production in residences with gas as the only prime energy provider.

Electric Energy and Electric Generators
1.1  Introduction
Energy is defined as the capacity of a body system to do mechanical work. Intelligent harnessing and 
control of energy determines essentially the productivity and, subsequently, the lifestyle advancement 
of society.
Energy is stored in nature in quite a few forms such as fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and natural gas); 
solar radiation; and in tidal, hydro, wind, geothermal, and nuclear forms.
Energy is not stored in nature in electrical form. However, electric energy is easy to transmit over very 
long distances and complies with customer’s needs through adequate control. More than 40% of energy 
is converted into electric energy before use, most of it through electric generators that convert mechani-
cal energy into electric energy. Work and energy have identical units. The fundamental unit of energy 
is 1 J, which represents the work of a force of 1 N in moving a body through a distance of 1 m along the 
direction of force (1 J = 1 N × 1 m). Electric power is the electric energy rate, and its fundamental unit is 
1 W = 1 J/s. Electric energy is more commonly measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh):

(1.1)
Thermal energy is usually measured in calories (cal). By definition, 1 cal is the amount of heat required 
to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 15ºC to 16ºC. The kilocalorie (kcal) is even more common 
(1 kcal = 103 cal).
As energy is a unified concept, as expected, the joule and calorie are directly proportional:
	
1 cal = 4.186 J	
(1.2)
A larger unit for thermal energy is the British thermal unit (BTU):
	
1 BTU = 1055 J = 252 cal	
(1.3)
A still larger unit is the quad (quadrillion BTU):

In the year 2000, the world used about 16 × 1012 kWh of energy, an amount above most projections 
(Figure 1.1).
An annual growth of 3.3%–4.3% was typical for world energy consumption in the period between 
1990 and 2000. A slightly lower rate is forecasted for the next 30 years.

Synchronous Generators
Besides annual energy usage (and growth rate), with over 30%–40% of total energy being converted 
into electric energy, it is equally important to evaluate and predict the electric power peaks for each 
country (region), as they determine the electric generation reserves. The peak electric power in the 
United States over several years is shown in Figure 1.2.
Peak power demands tend to be more dynamic than energy needs, and thus electric energy planning 
becomes an even more difficult task.
Implicitly, the transients and stability in electric energy (power) systems of the future tend to be more 
severe.
To meet these demands, we need to look at the main energy sources: their availability, energy density, 
the efficiency of the energy conversion to thermal to mechanical to electrical energy, and their second-
ary ecological effects (limitations).

Electric Energy and Electric Generators
1.2  Major Energy Sources
With the current annual growth in energy consumption, the fossil fuel supplies of the world will be 
depleted in, at best, a few hundred years, unless we do switch to other sources of energy or use energy 
conservation to tame energy consumption without compromising the quality of life.
The world estimated reserves of fossil fuel [1] and their energy density are shown in Table 1.1.
With a 14-year doubling time of energy consumption, if only coal would be used, the whole coal 
reserves will be depleted in about 125 years. Even if the reserves of fossil fuel were large, their predomi-
nant or exclusive usage is not feasible due to environmental, economical, or even political reasons.
Alternative energy sources are to be used more and more, with fossil fuels used slightly less, gradually, 
and more efficiently than today.
The relative cost of electric energy in 1991 from different sources is shown in Table 1.2.
Wind energy conversion is becoming cost-competitive while it is widespread, and it has limited envi-
ronmental impact.
Unfortunately, its output is not steady, and thus very few energy consumers rely solely on wind power 
to meet their electric energy demands. As in general, the electric power plants are connected in local or 
regional power grids with regulated voltage and frequency, connecting of large wind generator parks to 
the power grids may produce severe transients that have to be taken care of using sophisticated control 
systems with energy storage elements in most cases.
By the year 2014, over 300,000 MW of wind power generators were in place, a good part in the United 
States.
The total wind power resources of the planet are estimated at 15,000 TWh, so much more work in this 
area is expected in the near future.
Another indirect means of using solar energy, besides wind energy, is the stream-flow part of the 
hydrological natural cycle.
The potential energy of water is transformed into kinetic energy using a hydraulic turbine, which then 
drives an electric generator. The total hydropower capacity of the world is about 3 × 1012 W. Only less 
than 9% of which is used today because many regions with greatest potential have economic problems.
However, as energy costs from water are low, resources are renewable and with limited ecological 
impact. Despite initial high costs, hydropower is up for a new surge.
Tidal energy is obtained by filling a bay, closed by a dam, during periods of high tides and emptying 
it during low-tide time intervals. The hydraulic turbine to be used in tidal power generation should be 
reversible so that tidal power is available twice during each tidal period of 12 h and 25 min.
Though the total tidal power is evaluated at 64 × 1012 W, its occurrence in short intervals only requires 
large rating turbine—generator systems that are still expensive. The energy burst cannot be easily 
matched with demand unless large storage systems are built.

Synchronous Generators
These demerits make many of us still believe that the role of tidal energy to the world demand will 
be very limited, at least in the new future. However, exploiting submarine currents energy in wind-like 
low-speed turbines may be feasible.
Geothermal power is obtained by extracting the heat inside the earth. With a 25% conversion ratio, 
the useful geothermal electric power is estimated at 2.63 × 1010 MWh.
Fission and fusion are two forms of nuclear energy conversion to produce heat. Heat is converted to 
mechanical power in steam turbines that drive electric generators to produce electric energy.
Only fission-splitting nuclei of a heavy element such as uranium 235 are used commercially to ­produce 
a good percentage of electric power, particularly in developed countries.
As uranium 235 is in scarce supply, uranium 238 is converted into fissionable plutonium by absorb-
ing neutrons. One gram of uranium 238 will produce about 8 × 1010 J of heat. The cost of nuclear 
energy is still slightly higher than that from coal or gas (Table 1.2). The environmental problems with 
used nuclear fuel conservation or with reactor potential explosions are more and more the problem 
of public acceptance.
Fusion power combination of light nuclei such as deuterium and tritium at high temperatures and 
pressures is scientifically feasible, but it is not yet technically proven for efficient energy conversion.
Solar radiation may be used either through heat solar collectors or through direct conversion to elec-
tricity in photovoltaic cells. From an average of 1 kW/m2 of solar radiation, less than 180 W/m2 could be 
converted to electricity with up-to-date solar cells. Small energy density and nonuniform availability 
(during mainly sunny days) lead to higher cents/kWh than from other sources.
1.3  Limitations of Electric Power Generation
Factors limiting electric energy conversion are related to the availability of various fuels, technical con-
straints, ecological, social, and economical issues.
Ecological limitations are due to low-temperature excess heat and carbon dioxide (solid particles) and 
of oxide of sulfur nitrogen emissions from fuel burning.
Low-temperature heat exhaust is typical in any thermal energy conversion. When too large, this 
heat increases the earth’s surface temperature and, together with the emission of carbon dioxide and 
certain solid particles, have intricate effects on the climate. Global warming and climate changes appear 
to be caused by burning too much fossil fuel. Since the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima 
incidents, safe nuclear electric energy production has become not only a technical issue but also an 
ever-increasing social (public acceptance) problem.
Even hydro and wind energy conversion do pose some environmental problems, though much 
smaller than the fossil or nuclear fuel energy conversion does. We refer to changes in flora and fauna 
due to hydro-dams intrusion in the natural habitat. Big windmill farms tend to influence the fauna and 
are also sometimes considered “ugly” to the human eye.
Consequently, in forecasting the growth of electric energy consumption on earth, we must consider 
all these very complex limitation factors.
Shifting to more renewable energy sources (wind, hydro, tidal, solar, etc.) while using combined heat-
electricity production from fossil fuels to increase the energy conversion factor, together with intelligent 
energy conservation, could be a complicated, but a potent, way of increasing material prosperity in more 
harmony with the environment.
1.4  Electric Power Generation
Electric energy (power) is produced by coupling a prime mover that converts the mechanical energy 
(called a turbine) to an electrical generator, which then converts the mechanical energy into electri-
cal energy (Figure 1.3). An intermediate form of energy is used for storage in the electrical generator. 

5
Electric Energy and Electric Generators
This is the so-called magnetic energy stored, mainly between the stator (primary) and the rotor (second-
ary). The main types of “turbines” or prime movers are as follows:
Steam turbines
Gas turbines
Hydraulic turbines
Wind turbines
Diesel engines
Internal combustion engines
Figure 1.3, which is self-explanatory, illustrates the most commonly used technologies to produce electric 
energy. They all use a prime mover that outputs mechanical energy. There are also direct ways of electric 
energy production that avoid the mechanical energy stage—such as photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and

Synchronous Generators
electrochemical (fuel cells) technologies. As they do not use electric generators, and still represent only 
a tiny part of all electric energy produced on earth, their treatment falls beyond the scope of this book.
The steam (or gas) turbines in various configurations practically make use of all fossil fuels from coal 
to natural gas and oil and nuclear fuel or geothermal energy inside earth.
Usually, their efficiency reaches 40%; but in combined cycle (producing heat and mechanical power), their 
efficiency has reached recently 55%–60%. Powers per unit go as high as 100 MW and more at 3000 (3600 rpm); 
but for lower powers, in the MW range, higher speeds are feasible to reduce weight (volume) per power.
Recently, low-power, high-speed gas turbines (with combined cycle) in the range of 100 kW at 70,000–
80,000 rpm became available. Electric generators to match this variety of powers and speeds have also been 
produced. Such electric generators are also used as starting motors for jet plane engines on board of aircraft.
High speed, low volume and weight, and reliability are key factors for electric generators on board 
aircrafts. Power ranges are from hundreds of kWs to 1 MW in large aircraft. On ships or trains, electric 
generators are required either to power the electric propulsion motors or (and) for auxiliary multiple 
needs. Diesel engines (Figure 1.3b) drive the electric generators on board of ships or trains.
On vehicles, electric energy is used for various tasks for powers up to a few tens of klilowatts in 
general. The internal combustion (or diesel) engine drives an electric generator (alternator) directly or 
through a transmission (Figure 1.3c). The ever-increasing need for more electric power on vehicles to 
perform various tasks—from lighting to engine startup and from door openers to music devices and 
wind shield wipers and cooling blowers—imposes new challenges on electric generators of the future.
Hydraulic potential energy is converted to mechanical energy in hydraulic energy turbines. They in 
turn drive electric generators to produce electric energy. In general, the speed of hydraulic turbines is 
rather low—below 500 rpm—but in many cases below 100 rpm.
The speed depends on the water head and flow rate. High water head leads to higher speed, while high 
flow rate leads to lower speeds. Hydraulic turbines for low, medium, and high water heads have been 
perfected into a few most favored embodiments (Kaplan, Pelton, Francis, bulb type, Straflo, etc.)
With a few exceptions—in Africa, Asia, Russia, China, and South America—many large power/unit 
water energy reservoirs have been provided with hydroelectric power plants with large powers (in the 
hundreds and thousands of megawatt). Still by 1990 only 15% of the world’s main 624,000 MW reserves 
have been put to work. However, very many smaller water energy reservoirs still remain untapped. 
They need small hydrogenerators with powers below 5 MW at speeds of a few hundred revolutions per 
­minute. In many locations, tens of kilowatt micro hydrogenerators are more appropriate [2–5].
The time of small and micro hydroenergy has come finally, especially in Europe and North America 
where reserves left are less. Tables 1.3 and 1.4 show the world use of hydroenergy in terawatt in 1997 [6,7].
The World Energy Council estimated that by 1990 from total electric energy demand of 12,000 TWh, 
about 18.5% were contributed by hydroenergy. By 2020, the world electric energy demand is estimated 
to be 23,000 TWh. From this, if only 50% of all economically feasible hydroresources were put to work, 
the hydro would contribute 28% of the 2020s total electric energy demands.
These figures indicate that a new era of dynamic hydroelectric power development is to come soon, if 
the humanity desires more energy (prosperity for more people) but with a small impact on the environ-
ment (constant or less greenhouse emission effects).

Electric Energy and Electric Generators
Wind energy reserves, though discontinuous and unevenly distributed, mostly around shores, are 
estimated at four times the electric energy needs of today.
To its uneven distribution, its discontinuity and some not insurmountable public concerns about 
fauna and human habitats, we have to add the technical sophistication and costs required to control, 
store, and distribute wind electric energy. These are the obstacles to the widespread use of wind energy. 
For comparison more than 100,000 MW of hydropower reserves are tapped today in the world.
But ambitious plans are ahead with European Union planning to install more than 10,000 MW from 
2010 to 2020.
The power per unit for small hydropower increased to 4 MW and, for wind turbines, it increased up 
to 8 MW. More are being designed; but as the power per unit increases, the speed decreases to 10 rpm.
This poses an extraordinary problem: either use a special transmission and a high-speed generator or 
build a directly-driven low-speed generator. Both solutions have their own merits and demerits.
The lowest speeds in hydrogenerators are in general above 50 rpm but at much higher powers and thus 
much higher rotor diameters, which lead to still good performance.
Preserving high performance at 1–10 MW and less at speeds below 30 rpm in an electric generator 
poses serious challenges, but better materials, high energy permanent magnets, and ingenious designs 
are likely to facilitate in solving these problems.
It is estimated that wind energy will produce more than 10% of electric energy by 2020.
This means that wind energy technologies and business are apparently up to a new revival—this time

Electric generators operate traditionally either in large power grids—with many of them in parallel to 
provide voltage and frequency stability to changing load demands—or they stand alone.
The conventional large power grid supplies most electric energy needs and consists of electric power 
plants, transmission lines, and distribution systems (Figure 1.4).
Multiple power plants, many transmission power lines and complicated distribution lines, and so 
forth constitute a real regional or national power grid.
Such large power grids with a pyramidal structure—generation—transmission—distribution 
and billing—are now in place and, to connect a generator to such a system, comply with strict rules.

Synchronous Generators
The rules, standards, are necessary to provide quality power in terms of continuity, voltage, and fre-
quency constancy, phase symmetry, faults treatment, and so forth.
The bigger, the more stable seems to be the driving force behind building such huge “machine 
systems.”
The bigger the power/unit, the higher the energy efficiency was for decades, the rule that leads to 
steam generators of up to 1500 MW and hydrogenerators up to 760 MW.
However, investments in new power plants, redundant transmission power lines, and distribution 
systems did not always keep up with ever-increasing energy demands. This is how the blackouts have 
developed. Aside from extreme load demands or faults, the stability of power grids is limited mainly by 
the fact that existing synchronous electric generators work only at synchronism, that is, at a speed n1 
rigidly related to frequency f1 of voltage f1 = n × p. Standard power grids are served exclusively by syn-
chronous generators and have a pyramidal structure a called “utility” (see Figure 1.5). Utilities still run, 
in most places, the entire process from generation to retail settlement.
Today, the electricity market is deregulating at various pace in different parts of the world, though the 
process has been still considered in its infancy.
The new unbundled value chain (Figure 1.5b) breaks out the functions into the basic types: elec-
tric power plants, energy network owners, and operators; energy traders, brokers, and exchanges; and 
energy service providers and retailers [8,9]. This way, it is hoped to stimulate competition for energy 
costs reduction while also improving the power quality at the end users, by sustainable environment and 
more friendly technologies. Increasing the number of players needs clear rules of the game. In addition, 
the transients stresses on such power grid, with many energy suppliers entering, exiting, or varying 
their input, are likely to be more severe. To counteract such a difficulty, more flexible power transmis-
sion lines have been proposed and introduced in a few places (mostly in the United States) under the 
logo “FACTS”: flexible AC transmission systems [10].
FACTS introduces controlled reactive power capacitors in the power transmission lines in parallel, 
for higher voltage stability (short-term voltage support), and (or) in series for larger flow management 
in the long term (Figure 1.6).
Power electronics at high power and voltage levels is the key technology to FACTS.
Additionally, FACTS includes the AC–DC–AC power transmission lines to foster stability and to 
reduce losses in energy transport over large distances (Figure 1.7).
The direct current (DC) high-voltage large power bus allows for parallel connection of energy provid-
ers with only voltage control, and thus the power grid becomes more flexible.
However, this flexibility occurs at the price of full-power high-voltage converters that take advantage 
of the power electronics technologies.

Electric Energy and Electric Generators
Still, most electric generators are synchronous machines that need tight (rigid) speed control to 
­provide constant frequency output voltage.
To connect such generators in parallel, the speed controllers (governors) have to allow for a speed 
droop in order to produce balanced output of all generators. Of course, frequency also varies with load, 
but this variation is limited to less than 0.5 Hz.
Variable speed constant voltage and frequency generators with decoupled active and reactive power 
control would make the power grids naturally more stable and more flexible.
The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) 
­bidirectional converter in the three-phase rotor circuit supplied through brushes and slip rings does 
just that (Figure 1.8).
DFIG works as a synchronous machine and thus, fed in the rotor in AC at variable frequency f2, and 
operating at speed n it delivers power at the stator frequency f1:

Synchronous Generators
The frequency f2 is considered positive when the phase sequence in the rotor is same as in the sta-
tor and negative otherwise. In the conventional synchronous generator f2 = 0 (DC). DFIG is capable 
to work at f2 = 0 but also for f2<>0. With a bidirectional power converter, DFIG may work both as 
motor and generator with f2 negative and positive, that is, at speeds lower and larger than that of the 
standard synchronous machine. Starting is initiated from the rotor, with stator temporarily short-
circuited, then opened. Then the machine is synchronized and operated as motor or generator. The 
“synchronization” is feasible at all speeds within the design range (±20% in general). Therefore, not 
only generating but pumping mode is also available, besides flexibility in fast active and reactive 
power control.
Pump storage is used to store energy during peak-off hours and is then used for generation during 
peak hours at a total efficiency around 70% in large head hydropower plants.
DFIG units of up to 400 MW with about ±5% speed variation have been put to work in Japan, and also 
more recently (in 300 MW units) in Germany. The converter rating is about equal to the speed variation 
range, which limits the costs notably. Pump storage plants with conventional synchronous machines 
working as motors have been used in place for a few decades. DFIG/M, however, provides the optimum 
speed for pumping, which, for most hydroturbines, is different from that for generating.
While fossil-fuel DFIGs may be very good for power grids because of stability improvements, they are 
definitely the solution when pump storage is used and for wind generators above 1 MW per unit.
Will DFIG replace gradually the omnipresent synchronous generators in bulk electric energy conver-
sion? Most likely, as the technology is here already up to 400 MW/unit. At the distribution stage (local) 
stage (Figure 1.5b), a new structure is getting ground: the distributed power system (DPS). It refers to low 
power energy providers that can meet or supplement some local power needs.
DPS is expected to either work alone or be connected at the distribution stage to existing systems.
DPS is to be based on renewable resources such as wind, hydro, biomass alone, or integrate also 
gas turbine generators or diesel engine generators, solar panels, and fuel cells.
Powers in the orders of 1–2 MW possibly up to 5 MW/unit of energy conversion are contemplated.
DPSs are to be provided with all means of control, stability, and power quality so typical to conven-
tional power grids. With one big difference, they will make full use of power electronics to provide fast 
and robust active and reactive power control.
Here, besides synchronous generators with electromagnetic excitation, PM synchronous and cage-
rotor induction generators and DFIGs, all with power electronics control for variable speed operation, 
are already in place in quite a few applications. But their wide spread usage is only about to take place.
Stand-alone electric power generation ties directly the electric energy generator to the load. Stand-
alone systems may have one generator only (i.e., on board of trains and auto vehicles standby power 
groups) or 2–4 such generators such as on board of large aircraft or vessel. Stand-alone gas-turbine 
residential generators are also investigated for decentralized electricity production.

Electric Energy and Electric Generators
Stand-alone generators and their control are tightly related to the application, from the design to the 
embodiment of control and protection.
Vehicular generators have to be lightweight and efficient, in this order.
Standby (backup) power groups for hospitals, banks, telecom, have to be quickly available, reliable, 
efficient, and environment friendly.
Backup power generators are becoming a must in public buildings as now all use a cluster of comput-
ers. Battery or fuel cell-based uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), all with power electronics control, 
are also used at lower powers especially. They do not include electric generators and fall beyond our 
scope here.
Electric generators or motors are also used for mechanical energy storage “inertial batteries” 
(Figure 1.9) in vacuum, with magnetic suspension to store energy for minutes to hours. Speeds up to 
1 km/s (peripheral maximum speed with composite material flywheels) at the cost of 400–800 $/kW 
(50–100 $/kW for lead acid batteries) for an operation life of over 20 years (3–5 years for lead acid 
­batteries) [11] are feasible today.
PM synchronous generator/motors are ideal for the scope at rotational speeds, preferably around 
40 krpm, for the 3–300 kW range and less for the MW range.
Satellites, power quality systems (for active power control through energy storage), hybrid buses, 
trains (to store energy during braking), and electromagnetic launchers are typical applications for stor-
age generator–motor systems. The motoring mode is used to reaccelerate the flywheel (or charge the 
inertia battery) via power electronics.
Energy storage up to 500 MJ (per unit) is considered practical for applications that (at 50 Wh/kg den-
sity or more) need energy delivered in seconds or minutes at a time, for the duration of power outage. As 
most (80%) of power line disturbances last for less than 5 s, flywheel batteries can fill up this time with 
energy as standby power source. Yet very promising electrochemical and superconducting coil energy 
storage fall beyond our scope here.

1.6  Summary
This introductory study leads to the following conclusions:
Electric energy demand is on the rise (at a rate of 2%–3% per annum), but so are the environmental 
and social constraints on the electric energy technologies.
Renewable resources input is on the rise—especially wind and hydro, at powers of up to a few MW 
per unit.
Single-value power grids will change to bundled valued chains with electric energy opening to 
markets.
Electric generators should work at variable speed but provide constant voltage and frequency output 
via power electronics with full or partial power ratings, to tap more energy from renewable and 
provide faster and safer reactive power control.
The standard synchronous generator, working at constant speed for constant frequency output, is 
challenged by the DFIG at high-to-medium power (from hundreds of megawatts up to 10 MW) 
and by the PM synchronous generator and the induction generator with full-power bidirectional 
power electronics in the stator up to 10 MW range.
Most variable speed generators, with bidirectional power electronics control, will also allow motor-
ing (or starting) operation both in conventional or distributed power grids and in stand-alone 
(or vehicular) applications.
Home and industrial combined heat and electricity generation by burning gas in high-speed gas-
turbines imposes special electric generators with adequate power electronics digital control.
In view of such a wide power/unit and applications range, a classification of electric generators seems 
in order and this is the subject of Chapter 2.

Principles of Electric Generators
2.1  Three Types of Electric Generators
Electric generators may be classified in many ways, but the following are deemed fully representative:
•	 By principle
•	 By applications domain
The applications domain implies the power level. The classifications by principle unfolded here include 
commercial (widely used) types together with new configurations, which are still in the laboratory 
(although advanced) stages.
By principle, there are three main types of electric generators:
•	 Synchronous (Figure 2.1)
•	 Induction (Figure 2.2)
•	 Parametric (with magnetic anisotropy and permanent magnets)—Figure 2.3
Parametric generators have in most configurations doubly salient magnetic circuit structures; therefore, 
they may also be called “doubly salient electric generators.”
Synchronous generators (SGs) [1–4] have, in general, a stator magnetic circuit made of laminations 
provided with uniform slots that house a three-phase (sometimes single- or two-phase) winding and a 
rotor. It is the rotor design that leads to a cluster of SG configurations as can be seen in Figure 2.1.
They are all characterized by the rigid relationship among speed n, frequency f1, and the number of 
poles 2p1:
	
n
f
p
=
1
	
(2.1)
Those that are DC excited require power electronics excitation control, while those with permanent 
magnets (PMs) or (and) variable reluctance rotors have to use full power electronics in the stator to oper-
ate at adjustable speed. Finally, even electrically excited, SGs may be provided with full power electronics 
in the stator when they work alone or in power grids with DC high-voltage cable transmission lines.
Based on its principles, each of these configurations will be presented later on in this chapter.
For powers in the MW/unit range and less, induction generators have also been introduced. They are 
(Figure 2.2) as follows:
•	 With cage rotor and single stator winding
•	 With cage rotor and dual (main and additional) stator winding with different number of poles, 
in general
•	 With wound rotor

Principles of Electric Generators
PWM converters are connected to the stator (for the single stator winding and, respectively, to the 
­auxiliary stator winding for the case of dual stator winding)
The principle of the induction generator with single stator winding relies on the equation:
	
f
p n
f

=
+
	
(2.2)
where
f1 > 0 is the stator frequency
f2 <> 0 is the slip (rotor) frequency
n is the rotor speed (rps)
f2 may be either positive or negative in Equation 2.2, even zero, provided the PWM converter in the 
wound rotor is capable of supporting bidirectional power flow for speeds n above f1/p1 and below f1/p1.
Note that for f2 = 0 (DC rotor excitation), the SG operation mode is reobtained with the DFIG.
The slip S definition is as follows:
	
S

(2.3)
The slip is zero as f2 = 0 (DC) for the SG mode.
For the dual stator winding, the frequency–speed relationship is applied twice:

(2.4)
Therefore, the rotor bars experience, in principle, currents of two distinct (rather low) frequencies f2 and 
¢f2. In general, p2 > p1 to cover lower speeds.
The PWM converter feeds the auxiliary winding. Consequently, its rating is notably lower than that 
of the full power of the main winding and is proportional to speed variation range.
As it may work in the pure synchronous mode too, the DFIG may be used up to highest levels of pow-
ers for SGs (400 MW units have been already in use for some years in Japan) and 2× 300 MW pump 
storage plant is being now commissioned in Germany.
On the contrary, the cage rotor induction generator (CRIG) is more suitable for powers in the 
­megawatt and lower power range.
Parametric generators rely on the variable reluctance principle but may also use permanent magnets 
to enhance the power per volume and reduce generator losses.
There are quite a few configurations that suit this category such as the switched reluctance generator 
(SRG), the transverse flux PM generator (TFG), the flux reversal generator (FRG). In general, their prin-
ciple relies on co-energy variation due to magnetic anisotropy (without or with PMs on rotor or on sta-
tor), in the absence of a pure traveling field with constant speed (f1/p), so characteristic for synchronous 
and induction generators (machines).
2.2  Synchronous Generators
Synchronous generators (see Figure 2.1 for classifications) are characterized by an uniformly slotted sta-
tor laminated core, which hosts a three-, or two-, or one-phase AC winding and a DC current excited, 
or PM-excited or variable saliency, rotor [1–5].
As only two travelling fields—of the stator and rotor—at relative standstill interact to produce a 
­ripple-less torque, the speed n is rigidly tied to stator frequency f1, because the rotor-produced magnetic 
field is DC, typically heteropolar in SGs.

16
Synchronous Generators
They are built with nonsalient pole, distributed excitation rotors (Figure 2.4) for 2p1 = 2, 4 (i.e., high 
speed or turbogenerators) or with salient-pole concentrated excitation rotor (Figure 2.5) for 2p1 > 4 (in 
general, for low-speed or hydrogenerators).
As power increases, the rotor peripheral speed also increases. In large turbogenerators, it may reach 
more than 150 m/s (in a 200 MVA machine Dr = 1.2 m diameter rotor at n = 3600 rpm, 2p1 = 2, U = π Dr 
n = π × 1.2 × 3600/60 > 216 m/s). The DC excitation placement in slots, with DC coil end connections 
protected against centrifugal forces by rings of highly resilient resin materials, thus becomes necessary. 
In addition, the DC rotor current air-gap field distribution is closer to a sinusoid.
Consequently, the harmonics content of the stator-motion-induced voltage (emf or no-load voltage) is 
smaller, thus complying with the strict rules (standards) of commercial, large power grids.
The rotor body is made of solid iron for better mechanical rigidity and heat transmission.
The stator slots in large SGs are open (Figures 2.4 and 2.5), and they are sometimes provided with mag-
netic wedges in order to further reduce the field space harmonics and thus reduce the emf ­harmonics content 
and rotor additional losses in the rotor damper cage. When n = f1/p1 and for steady-state (sinusoidal symmet-
ric stator currents of constant amplitude), the rotor damper cage currents are zero. However, should any load 
or mechanical transients occur, eddy currents show up in the damper cage to attenuate the rotor oscillations 
when the stator is connected to a constant frequency and voltage (high power) grid.
The rationale neglects the stator magnetomotive force space harmonics due to the placement of wind-
ings in slots and also due to slot openings. These space harmonics induce voltages and thus produce 
eddy currents in the rotor damper cage even during steady state.
In addition, even during steady state, if the stator phase currents are not symmetric, their inverse 
components produce currents of 2f1 frequency in the damper cage.
Consequently, to limit the rotor temperature, the degree of current (load) unbalance permitted is 
limited by standards.
Nonsalient pole DC-excited rotor SGs have been manufactured for 2p1 = 2, 4 poles high speed 
­turbogenerators that are driven by gas or steam turbines.

Principles of Electric Generators
For lower speed SGs with a large number of poles (2p1 > 4), the rotors are made of salient rotor poles pro-
vided with concentrated DC excitation coils. The peripheral speeds are lower than for ­turbogenerators; 
even for high-power hydrogenerators (for 200 MW 14 m rotor diameter at 75 rpm, and 2p1 = 80, f1 = 50 Hz, 
the peripheral speed U = π × Dr × n = π × 14 × 75/60 > 50 m/s). About 80 m/s is the upper limit, in general, 
for salient pole rotors. Still, the excitation coils have to be protected against centrifugal forces.
The rotor pole shoes may be made of laminations—to reduce additional rotor losses—but the rotor 
pole bodies and core are made of mild magnetic solid steel.
With a large number of poles, the stator windings are built for a smaller number of slot/pole: between 6 
and 12, in many cases. The number of slots per pole and phase, q, is thus between 2 and 4. The smaller the q, 
the larger the presence of space harmonics in the emf. A fractionary q might be preferred, say 2.5, which also 
avoids the subharmonics and leads to a cleaner (more sinusoidal) emf, to comply with the current standards.
The rotor pole shoes are provided with slots that house copper bars short-circuited by copper rings to 
form a rather complete squirrel cage. A stronger damper cage is thus obtained.
DC excitation power on the rotor is transmitted by one of the following:
•)>> Copper sliprings and brushes (Figure 2.6)
•)>> Brushless excitation systems (Figure 2.7)
The controlled rectifier, whose power is around 3% of generator rated power, and that has a sizeable 
voltage reserve to force the current in the rotor quickly, controls the DC excitation currents according 
to the needs of generator voltage and frequency stability.
Alternatively, an inverted SG (whose three-phase AC windings and diode rectifier are placed on the 
rotor and the DC excitation in the stator) may play the role of a brushless exciter (Figure 2.7). The field 
current of the exciter is controlled through a low-power half-controlled rectifier. Unfortunately, the 
electrical time constant of the exciter generator notably slows down the response in the main SG excita-
tion current control.
Still another brushless exciter could be built around a single-phase (or three phase) rotating trans-
former working at a frequency above 300 Hz to cut down its volume considerably (Figure 2.8).

Synchronous Generators
An inverter is required to feed the transformer primary at variable voltage but at constant frequency.
The response time in the generator’s excitation current control is short, and the size of the rotating 
transformer is rather small.
In addition, the response in the excitation control does not depend on speed and may be used from 
standstill.
Claw pole (Lundell) SGs are built now mostly as car alternators. The excitation winding power in p.u. 
is reduced considerably for the multiple rotor construction (2p1 = 10, 12, 14) preferred to reduces external 
diameter and machine volume.

Principles of Electric Generators
The claw pole solid cast iron structure (Figure 2.9) is less costly to manufacture, while the single ring-
shaped excitation coil produces a multipolar air-gap field (though with a three-dimensional field path) 
with reduced copper volume and DC power losses.
The stator holds a simplified three-phase single-layer winding with three slots per pole, in general. 
Though slip-rings and brushes are used, the power transmitted through them is small (in the order of 
60–200 W for car and truck alternators), and thus small power electronics is used to control the output.

Synchronous Generators
The total costs of the claw pole generator for automobiles including field current control and the diode 
full power rectifier is low and so is the specific volume.
However, the total efficiency, including the diode rectifier and excitation losses, is low at 14 V DC 
output: 70% at 2.5 kW and 6 krpm and below 55% at 12 krpm. To blame are the diode losses (at 14 V DC), 
the mechanical losses, and the eddy currents induced in the claw poles by the space and time harmonics 
of the stator currents mmf. Increasing the voltage to 42 V DC would reduce the diode losses in relative 
terms, while the building of the claw poles from composite magnetic materials would reduce notably 
the claw pole eddy current losses. A notably higher efficiency would result (80% at 8 kW), even if the 
excitation power might slightly increase, due to lower permability (500µ0) of the today’s best composite 
magnetic materials. Also higher power levels might be obtained.
The concept of claw pole alternator may be extended to the megawatt range, provided the number 
of poles is increased (at 50/60 Hz or more) in variable speed wind and microhydrogenerators with 
DC-controlled output voltage of a local DC bus.
Though the claw pole SG could be built with the excitation on the stator too, to avoid brushes, the 
configuration is bulky and the arrival of high energy permanent magnets for rotor DC excitation has

The rapid development of high energy PMs with a rather linear demagnetization curve has led to wide-
spread use of PM synchronous motors for variable speed drives [6–10]. As electric machines are revers-
ible by principle, the generator regime is also available and, for directly driven wind generators in the 
hundreds of kW or MW range (8 MW, 490 rpm), such solutions are being proposed. Super-high-speed 
gas turbine-driven PMSGs in the 100 kW range at 60–80 krpm are also introduced. Finally, PMSGs are 
being considered as starter-generators for the cars of the near future.
There are two main types of rotors for PMSGs:
•	 With rotor surface PMs (Figure 2.10)—nonsalient pole rotor (SPM)
•	 With interior PMs of Equation 2.11—salient pole rotor (IPM)

Principles of Electric Generators
The configuration in Figure 2.10 shows a PM rotor made with parallelepipedic PM pieces such that each 
pole is patched with quite a few of them, circumpherentially and axially.
The PMs are held tight to the solid (or laminated) rotor iron core by special adhesives, but also a 
highly resilient resin coating is added for mechanical rigidity.
The stator contains a laminated core with uniform slots (in general) that house a three-phase winding 
with distributed (standard) coils or with concentrated (fractionary) coils.
The rotor is practically isotropic from the magnetic viewpoint. There is some minor difference 
between d and q axis magnetic permeances because the PM recoil permeability (µrec ≈ (1.04–1.07)µ0 at 
20°C) increases somewhat with temperature for NdFeB and SmCo high energy PMs.
Therefore, the rotor may be considered magnetically nonsalient (the magnetization inductances 
Ldm and Lqm are almost equal to each other).
To protect the PMs, mechanically, and produce reluctance torque, interior PM pole rotors have been 
introduced. Two typical configurations are shown in Figure 2.11a through c.
Figure 2.11a shows a practical solution for 2 pole interior PM (IPM) rotors. A practical 2p1 = 4, 6,… IPM 
rotor as shown in Figure 2.11b has an inverse saliency: Ldm < Lqm as usual with IPM machines. Finally, a 
high-saliency rotor (Ldm < Lqm), obtained with multiple flux barriers and PMs acting along axis q (rather 
than axis d), is presented in Figure 2.11c. It is a typical IPM machine but with large magnetic saliency. In 
such a machine, the reluctance torque is larger than the PM-interactive torque. The PMs field saturates 
the rotor flux bridges first and then overcompensates the stator-produced field in axis q. This way the 
stator flux along q axis decreases with current in axis q. For further flux weakening and torque control, 
the Id current component is controlled. Wide constant power (flux weakening) speed range of more than 
5:1 has been obtained this way. Starter/generators on cars are a typical application for this rotor.
As the PM role is limited, lower grade (lower Br) PMs, at lower costs, may be used.
It is also possible to use the variable reluctance rotor with high magnetic saliency (Figure 2.11a)—
without permanent magnets. With the reluctance generator, either power grid or stand-alone mode 
operation is feasible. For stand-alone operation capacitor self-excitation is needed. The performance is 
moderate, but the rotor cost is also moderate. Standby power sources would be a good application for 
reluctance SGs with high saliency Ldm/Lqm > 4.
PMSGs are characterized by high torque (power) density and high efficiency (excitation losses are 
zero). However, the costs of high energy PMs are still $100 and more per kilogram. In addition, to con-
trol the output, full power electronics is needed in the stator (Figure 2.12).
A bidirectional power flow PWM converter, with adequate filtering and control, may run the PM 
machine either as a motor (for starting the gas turbine) or as a generator, with controlled output at vari-
able speed. The generator may work at the power grid mode or in stand-alone mode. These flexibility 
features, together with fast power-active and reactive-decoupled control at variable speed, may make 
such solutions a way of the future, at least in the tens and hundreds of kilowatt range, and more.
Many other PMSG configurations have been introduced, such as those with axial air gap. Among 
them, we will mention one that is typical in the sense that it uses the IPM reluctance rotor (Figure 2.11c), 
but it adds an electrical excitation. (Figure 2.13) [11].
Besides the reluctance and PM interaction torque, there will be an excitation interaction torque. 
The excitation current may be positive or negative to add or subtract from Id current component in the 
stator.
This way at low speeds, the controlled positive field current will increase and control the output volt-
age; while at high speeds, a negative field current will suppress the emf, when needed to keep the voltage 
constant.
For DC-controlled generating only a diode rectifier is necessary, as the output voltage is regulated via 
DC current control in four quadrants. A low-power four-quadrant chopper is needed. For wide-speed-
range applications, such hybrid excitation rotor may be a competitive solution. The rotor is not very 
rugged mechanically, but it can handle easily peripheral speeds of up to 50 m/s (10,000 rpm for 0.1 m 
diameter rotor).

2.4  Homopolar Synchronous Generator
Placing both the DC excitation coils and the three-phase AC winding on the stator characterizes, the 
so-called homopolar (or inductor) synchronous machine (generator and motor)—Figure 2.14.
The rather rugged rotor with solid (even laminated) salient poles, and solid core is an added advan-
tage. The salient rotor poles (segments) and interpoles produce a salient magnetic structure with a nota-
ble saliency ratio, especially if the air gap is rather small.
Consequently, the DC field current—produced magnetic field closes paths partially axially, partially 
circumpherentially, through stator and rotor, but it is tied (fixed) to the rotor pole axis.
It is always maximum in the axis of rotor poles and small, but of same polarity, in the axis of ­interpoles. 
An AC air-gap magnetic component is present in this homopolar distribution. Its peak value is ideally 
50% of maximum air-gap field of the DC excitation current. Fringing reduces it to 35%–40% (Figure 
2.14a through c), at best.
The machine is a salient pole machine with doubled air gap, but it behaves as a quasi-nonsalient pole 
rotor one and with rotor excitation.
Therefore, for same air-gap flux density fundamental Bg1 (Figure 2.14), same mechanical air gap, the 
DC mmf of the field winding is doubled and the power loss quadruples. However, the ring-shaped coil

reduces the copper weight and losses (especially when the number of poles increases) in comparison 
with a multipolar heteropolar DC rotor excitation system. The blessing of circularity comes into place 
here. We have to note also the additional end connection in the middle of the stator AC three-phase 
winding, between the two slotted laminated cores.
The rotor mechanical ruggedness is really superior only with solid iron poles when made in one 
piece. Unfortunately, stator mmf and slot space harmonics induce eddy currents in the rotor solid poles, 
reducing notably the efficiency, typically below 90% in a 15 kW, 15,000 rpm machine.
2.5  Induction Generator
The cage rotor induction machine is known to work as a generator, provided
•	 The frequency f1 is smaller than n × p1 (speed × pole pairs): S < 0 (Figure 2.15a)
•	 There is a source to magnetize the machine
An induction machine working as a motor, supplied to a fixed frequency and voltage f1, V1 power grid, 
becomes a generator if it is driven by a prime mover above no-load ideal speed f1/p1:

(2.5)
Alternatively, the induction machine with cage rotor may self-excite on a capacitor at its terminals 
(Figure 2.15b).
For an induction generator connected to a strong (constant frequency and voltage) power grid, when 
the speed n increases (above f1/p1), the active power delivered to the power grid increases, but so does the 
reactive power drawn from power grid.

Synchronous Generators
Many existing wind generators use such CRIGs connected to the power grid. The control is only 
mechanical. The blade pitch angle is adjusted according to wind speed and power delivery requirements. 
However, such IGs tend to be rigid as they are stable only until n reaches the value:

where SK is the critical sleep, which decreases with rated power and is, anyway, below 0.08 for IGs in the 
hundreds of kilowatts. Additional parallel capacitors at power grid are required to compensate for the 
reactive power drained by the IG.
Alternatively, the reactive power may be provided by paralleled (plus series) capacitors (Figure 2.15b). 
In this case, we do have a self-excitation process that requires some remanent flux in the rotor (from 
previous operation) and the presence of magnetic saturation (Figure 2.15b). The frequency f1 of self-
excitation voltage (under no load) depends on the capacitor value and on the magnetization curve of the 
induction machine Ψ1 (I10):

The trouble is that on load, even if the speed is constant through prime mover speed control, the output 
voltage and frequency vary with load. For constant speed, if a frequency reduction under load of 1 Hz is 
acceptable, voltage control suffices. A three-phase AC chopper (variac) supplying the capacitors would 
do it, but the harmonics introduced by it have to be filtered out. In simple applications, a combination 
of parallel and series capacitors would provide rather constant (with 3%–5% regulation) voltage up to 
rated load.
Now, if variable speed is to be used, then, for constant voltage and frequency, PWM converters are 
needed. Such configurations are illustrated in Figure 2.16. A bidirectional power flow PWM converter 
(Figure 2.16a) provides both generating and motoring functions at variable speed. The capacitor in the 
DC line of the converter may lead not only to active but also reactive power delivery. Connection to 
the power grid without large transients is implicit, and therefore is fast, decoupled, active, and reactive 
power control.
The standalone configuration in Figure 2.16b is less expensive, but it provides only unidirectional 
power flow. A typical V1/f1 converter for drives is used. It is possible to inverse the connections, that is, 
to connect the diode rectifier and capacitors to the grid and the converter to the machine. This way, the 
system works as a variable speed drive for pumping, etc., if a local power grid is available. This com-
mutation may be done automatically though it would take 1–2 min. For variable speed—in a limited 
range—an excitation capacitor in two stages would provide the diode rectifier with only slightly variable 
DC link voltage.
Provided the minimum and maximum converter voltage limits are met, the former would operate 
over the entire speed range. Now the converter is V1/f1 controlled for constant voltage and frequency.
A transformer (Y, Y0) may be needed to accommodate unbalanced (or single-phase) loads.
The output voltage may be close-loop controlled through the PWM converter. On the other end, 
the bidirectional PWM converter configuration may be provided with a reconfigurable control sys-
tem such that to work not only on the power grid but to separate itself smoothly to operate as 
standalone, or wait on standby and then be reconnected smoothly to the power grid. Thus, mul-
tifunctional power generation at variable speed is produced. As evident in Figure 2.16, full power 
electronics is required. For a limited speed range, say up to 25%, it is possible to use two IGs with 
cage rotor and different pole numbers (2p2/2p1 = 8/6, 5/4, 4/3…). The one with more poles, (2p2 > 2p1) 

27
Principles of Electric Generators
is rated at 25% of rated power and fed from a bidirectional power converter sized also at about 25%. 
The scheme works at the power grid (Figure 2.17).
The softstarter reduces the synchronization transients and disconnects the 100% IG when the power 
required is below 25%. Then the 25% IG remains alone at work, at variable speed (n > f1/p1), to tap the 
energy available from, for example, low-speed wind or from a low head microhydroturbine. In ­addition, 
above 25% load, when the main (100%) IG works, the 25% IGs may add power as generator or work in 
motoring for better dynamics and stability. Now we may imagine a single rotor-stator IG with two sepa-
rate stator windings (2p2 > 2p1) to perform the same task.
The reduction in rating, from 100% to 25%, of the bidirectional PWM converter is noteworthy.
The main advantage of the dual IG or dual stator winding IG is lower costs, although for lower 
­performance (low-speed range above f1/p1).

2.6  Wound-Rotor Doubly Fed Induction Generator
It all started between 1907 and 1913, with the Scherbius and Kraemer cascade configurations, which are 
both slip power recovery schemes of wound rotor induction machines. Leonhard analyzed it pertinently 
in 1928, but adequate power electronics for it was not available then. A slip recovery scheme with thyris-
tor power electronics is shown in Figure 2.18a. Unidirectional power flow, from IG rotor to the converter, 
is only feasible because of the diode rectifier. A step-up transformer is necessary for voltage adaption, 
while the thyristor inverter produces constant voltage and frequency output. The principle of operation 
is based on the frequency theorem of traveling fields.

Negative frequency means that the sequence of rotor phases is different from the sequence of stator 
phases. Now, if f2 is variable, n may also be variable as long as Equation 2.7 is fulfilled.
That is, constant frequency f1 is provided in the stator for adjustable speed. The system may work at 
the power grid or even as standalone, although with reconfigurable control. When f2 > 0, n < f1/p1, we do 
have subsynchronous operation. The case for f2 < 0, n > f1/p1 corresponds to hypersynchronous opera-
tion. Synchronous operation takes place at f2 = 0 which is not feasible with the diode rectifier current 
source inverter, but it is with the bidirectional PWM converter.

The slip recovery system can work as a subsynchronous (n < f1/p) motor or as a supersynchronous 
(n > f1/p) generator. The WRIG with bidirectional PWM converter may work as a motor and generator 
both for subsynchronous and supersynchronous speed.
The power flow directions for such a system are shown in Figure 2.19.

where K = 1–1.4 depending on the reactive power requirements from the converter.
Note that being placed in the rotor circuit, through slip rings and brushes, the converter rating is 
around |Smax| in%. The larger the speed range, the larger the rating and the costs of the converter. Also 
the fully bidirectional PWM converter—as a back-to-back voltage source multilevel PWM converter 
system—may provide fast and continuous decoupled active and reactive power control operation even at 
synchronism (f2 = 0, DC rotor excitation). And it may perform the self-starting as well. The self-starting 
is done by short-circuiting the stator first, previously disconnected from the power grid, and supplying 
the rotor through the PWM converter in the subsynchronous motoring mode. The rotor accelerates up 
to a prescribed speed corresponding to ¢ >

. Then the stator winding is opened and, with the

2.7  Parametric Generators
Parametric generators exploit the magnetic anisotropy of both the stator and the rotor. PMs may be 
added on the stator or on the rotor. Single magnetic saliency with PMs on the rotor is also used in some 
configurations. The parametric generators use nonoverlapping (concentrated) windings to reduce end-
connection copper losses on the stator.
As the stator mmf does not produce a pure traveling field, there are core losses both in the stator 
and in the rotor. The simplicity and (or) ruggedness of such generators made them adequate for some 
applications.
Among parametric generators, some of the most representative are detailed here:
•	 Switched reluctance generators (SRGs):
•	 Without PMs
•	 With PMs on stator or on rotor
•	 Transverse flux generators (TFGs):
•	 With rotor PMs
•	 With stator PMs
•	 Flux reversal generators (FRGs):
•	 With PMs on the stator
•	 With PMs on the rotor (and flux concentration)
•	 Linear motion alternators (LMAs):
•	 With coil mover and PMs on the stator
•	 With PM mover tubular or flat (with PM flux concentration)
•	 With iron mover and PMs on the stator
The SRG [12] has a double saliency magnetic laminated structure—on the stator and the rotor—and 
concentrated coils on the stator (Figure 2.20). The stator phases are PWM voltage fed as long as the rotor 
poles are approaching them, one at a time, for the three-phase configuration. The phase inductances 
vary with rotor position (Figure 2.21) and, at least for the three-phase configuration, there is little mag-
netic coupling between phases.
Eventually, each phase is turned on around point A (in Figure 2.21); then it magnetizes the 
phase and the dL/dθ effect produces a motion-induced voltage (emf) which, in interaction with

the phase current, produces torque. The phase is turned off around point B when the next phase 
is turned on. The current polarity is not relevant, and thus positive current flows through voltage 
PWM. The maximum voltage is applied until the phase current magnetizes to maximum admit-
ted current.
As part of the AB interval available for generating is lost to the magnetization process, the latter takes 
up around 30% of energy available per cycle. For the single-phase machine, the torque, as expected, has 
notches as only the negative slopes of the inductance are adequate for generating.
It is the machine simplicity and ruggedness that characterize SRGs. High speed is feasible. Rotor 
higher temperature due to the local environment is also acceptable since these are no PMs or wind-
ings on the rotor. PMs may be added on the rotor (Figure 2.22a,b) [13,14]. In this situation, the current 
polarity has to change, and the torque production relies heavily on phase interaction through PMs. The 
reluctance torque is small.
Alternatively, PMs may be placed on the stator (Figure 2.22c) [15] with some PM flux concentration. 
Again the reluctance torque is reduced and PM torque prevails. The PM flux polarity in one phase does 
not change sign, therefore we may call it a homopolar PM excitation.
Other SRG configurations with homopolar excitation flux have been proposed but did not reach the 
markets thus far.

2.7.1  Flux Reversal Generators
In these configurations, reliance is on PM flux switch (reversal) in the stator-concentrated coils 
(Figure 2.23a [16]).
The PM flux linkage in the stator coils of Figure 2.23a changes sign when the rotor moves 90° 
(mechanical) and does the same, for each phase in Figure 2.23b for the three-phase FRG, when rotor 
moves 22.5° mechanical degrees. We use “flux reversal” instead of “flux switch” in the hope for clarity.
In general, it is π/Nr (which corresponds to π electrical radius). The electrical and mechanical radians 
are related as follows:

Therefore, the frequency of the electromagnetic force f1 is as if the number of pole pairs on the rotor was Nr.
The three-phase FRG configuration [17] makes better use of stator and rotor core and the manu-
facturing process is easier than that for the single-phase, as the coils are inserted by the conventional 
­technology. Premade stator poles, with coils on, may be mounted inside the stator back iron as done with 
rotor poles in salient poles in hydrogenerators. The main problem is the large flux fringing due to the 
juxtaposition of the N–S poles (there could be 2, 4, 6… of them on a stator pole). This reduces the use-
ful flux to about 0.3–0.4 of its ideal value (in homopolar stator excitation this situation is quite normal).

Principles of Electric Generators
Stator PM flux concentration should provide better torque density for same power factor. An example 
three-phase configuration is shown in Figure 2.24.
It is evident that the manufacturing of stator is a bit more complicated and the usage of stator core is 
partial, still PM flux concentration may increase the torque density without compromising too much 
the power factor. The phases are magnetically independent and thus high fault tolerance is expected.
For a better core utilization, the PMs with flux concentration may be placed on the rotor. An interior 
stator is added to complete the magnetic circuit (Figure 2.25).
The second (interior) windingless stator poses some manufacturing problems (the rotor also), but the 
higher torque/volume at acceptable power factor may justify it.
The power factor is mentioned here because it influences the converter KVAs through reactive power 
demands.
FRGs are, in general, meant mainly for low-speed applications such as directly driven wind genera-
tors, or vessel generator/motors, and so forth.

The TFGs are built in single-phase configurations with ring-shaped stator coils and surface PMs on the 
rotor (Figure 2.26) or with PM rotor flux concentration (Figure 2.27) [17,18].
The double-sided (dual-stator) configuration in Figure 2.27 takes advantage of PM flux concentration 
on the rotor. In general, TFGs are characterized by low winding losses, due to the blessing of the ring-
shaped coil.
A three-phase machine is built by adding axially three single-phase units, properly displaced tangen-
tially by 2π/3 with each other. It is evident that the stators could be best built from magnetic composite 
materials. However, this solution would reduce torque density since the permeability of such materials is 
below 500µ0 under some magnetic saturation. The core losses would be reduced if frequency goes above 
600 Hz with magnetic composite materials (magnetic powder).
The stator-PM TFG (originally called axial flux circumpherential current (AFCC) PM machine [19]) 
imposes the use of composite magnetic materials both on the stator and on the rotor due to its intricated 
geometry. Again, it is essentially a single-phase machine. PM flux concentration occurs along axial 
direction. Good use of PMs and cores is inherent in the axial–air gap stator PM FRG in Figure 2.28a.
FRG need more PMs than usual, but the torque density is rather good and compact geometries are 
very likely. The large number of poles on the rotor in most TFG leads to a good frequency, unless speed 
is not very low.
The rather high torque density (in Nm/m3, or (6–9) N/cm2 of rotor shear stress) is inherent as the 
number of PM flux reversals (poles) in the stator ring-shaped coils per revolution is large. This effect may 
be called “torque magnification” [11].

Principles of Electric Generators
Though there are very many potential LMA configurations (or actuators), they all use PMs and fall 
into three main categories [20]:
•	 With moving coil (and stator PMs); Figure 2.29a
•	 With moving PMs (and stator coil); Figure 2.29b
•	 With moving iron (and stator PMs); Figure 2.29c
In essence, the PM flux linkage in the coil changes sign when the mover travels the excursion length lstroke, 
which serves as a kind of pole pitch. Therefore they are, in a way, single-phase flux reversal machines.

To secure high-efficiency, beryllium–copper flexured springs (Figure 2.30) are used to store the 
kinetic energy of the mover at excursion ends. They also serve as linear bearings. The proper frequency

The strokes involved in LMAs are in the order of 0.5–100 mm or so. Thus, their power, in general, is 
limited to 10–50 kW at 50 (60) Hz.
They are basically synchronous phase machines with harmonic motion and linear flux to position 
ideal variation.

Synchronous Generators
Further increasing the power per volume requires—if average speed Us is limited—configurations 
with PM flux concentration and three phases. Such a single-phase flat configuration—with moving 
PMs—is shown in Figure 2.31 [26].
Again it is a single-phase device and the PM flux reverses polarity when the mover advances one 
“small,” stator, pole (tooth). The two twin stators are also displaced by one small stator tooth, to provide 
for optimal magnetic circuit completion. Large air gap PM flux densities of up to 1.25 T may be obtained 
under the stator teeth with 0.65 T left for armature reaction, to secure both high force (power) density 
and satisfactory power factor (or reasonable IX/E ≤ 0.5 ratio; X—machine reactance). The PM height hPM 
per pole pitch τPM is hPM/τPM ≈ 1.5–2.5 as all PMs are active all the time and full use of both stator and 
mover cores and copper is made.

Note:  There are also LMAs that exploit progressive (rather than oscillatory) linear motion. Applications 
include auxiliary power LMAs on magnetically levitated vehicles (MAGLEVs) and plasma magnetohy-
drodynamic (MHD) linear motion DC generators with superconducting excitation (see Chapter 20).
2.8  Electric Generator Applications
The application domains for electric generators embrace almost all industries—traditional and new—
with powers from mW to hundreds of MW/unit and more [20–25].
Table 2.1 summarizes our view of electric generator main applications and the competitive types that 
may suit each person and need. An overview on large power wind generators is offered as an example of 
the myriad of solutions for a single application field.
2.9  High-Power Wind Generators
2.9.1  Introduction
By high power, we mean here MW range (0.75–10) MW/unit wind generators, Figure 2.32a, and also 
by “less PM” the paper means less NdFeB kg/kW of wind generator or the use of ferrite PMs. “No PM” 
refers to wind generators without PMs, be them commercial (DC-excited SGs or CRIGs controlled by 
AC–AC PWM full power converters or wound rotor DFIG, controlled by partial (30%–40%) rating 
power AC–AC PWM converters), or solutions, under various development stages, which show good 
potential for the application. The present study was triggered by the steep rise in 2010–2012 (apparently 
here to stay) of NdFeB PM price (above 130 $/kg), as shown on Figure 2.32b, which may shift away the 
accent from the recently successful directly driven PMSGs with tone of NdFeB in the 3–10 MW range. 
Quite a few things have to be reconsidered on this occasion. Among them are brushless generator sys-
tem configurations for lower maintenance effort, better handling of asymmetrical power grid voltage 
sags with PWM converters, practical protection schemes, and power/unit increase at higher efficiency

multiplied by power factor in order to reduce the PWM converter kV A and costs. Even higher gear 
ratio for 3000–4000 rpm generators with modular (0.75 MW/unit) multiple units with smaller volume/
kW and outer diameter or high voltage (>20 kV) generators will also be considered. All the above are to 
be considered first for large off-shore wind parks with on-ground DC–AC high voltage (50–200 MVA) 
inverter interfacing to the power grid.
Given the numerous large (MW range) wind generator/turbine powers/speeds available on the ­markets 
[28,29], up to 6 MW at around 10 rpm turbine speed with 7.5 MW (www.enercon.de) direct drive DC-
excited synchronous and 8 MW, 9 rpm [1] with multibrid (500 rpm) PMSGs that are very close to the com-
mercialization, a dual classification of existing solutions is done in Table 2.2.
Table 2.2 illustrates the four main commercial types of wind generators: CRIG, PMSG, dceSG, asso-
ciated with full power AC–AC PWM converters and, by consequence, also with very good handling 
of voltage sags and high reactive power capability, and WRIG (DFIG) associated with partial rating

(20%–40%) AC–AC PWM converter connected to the wound rotor, through slip-rings and brushes. 
A generic wind generator system for DFIG, SG, and IG is shown in Figure 2.33. There are four speed 
ranges of wind generators in relation to the transmission ratio in Table 2.2, but, in reality, the high-speed 
(250:1) gear ratio class that leads to high frequency (max. 1–1.2 kHz) generators (PMSGs) (which require 
reasonably small PM quantities) is yet to be thoroughly evaluated; because it implies breakthroughs in 
the multi-stage mechanical transmission in terms of lower overall diameter, and volume to allow for a 
reasonable volume and weight of the nacelle, etc.
Detailed performance and active materials weight comparisons of various designs of the topologies 
in Table 2.2 for 3 MW, 15 rpm turbine generators are offered in Ref. [30]. In terms of total costs per kW 
or kW h, they are objectively in question, because the price of NdFeB magnets has increased sharply 
in the last 3 years from the 40$ considered in Reference [30]; in addition, the converter cost is given as 
50 $/kW while it should be given, in $/kV A, because the machine power factor affects the peak kV A of 
the converter and thus its costs and losses.

Synchronous Generators
In addition, as the generator frame (construction) weight and cost, generator system cost and other 
wind turbine costs are much larger than the active materials costs in the generator, any error here (or any 
sharp progress in the near future: such as active magnetic suspension of the generators rotor) would ren-
der the conclusion of the study hardly practical in terms of kW h/$. Therefore, selecting from Reference 
[30] the results, in Table 2.3 have been obtained.
The differences in kW h/$ are up to 10%, but they may become more favorable to PM-less solu-
tions (especially against direct-drive PMSG that needs 1.7 t NdFeB magnets). As the generator frame 
weight is rather proportional to the weight of its active materials, the reduction of the latter becomes 
even a more important challenge in the future; further gear weight reduction is also needed. As the 
total losses are minimum for DD-PMSG at reasonable weight (24.1 t), the following question arises: 
Can this solution be attempted with ferrite PMs (6 $/kg) for Br = 0.45 T by strong flux concentra-
tion? If so, at how much higher weight and at what power factor for similar efficiency with NdFeB 
machine; evidently, at lower active material costs. On the other hand, the even larger off-shore wind 
parks require turbine-generator units up to 10 MW. The results of such pitch-controlled turbine sys-
tem designs with NdFeB PMSG [31] and WRIG (DFIG) direct drive [32] are summarized in Table 2.4, 
which suggests the following:
•	 The DD-DFIG seems capable of producing 10 MW at 10 rpm at about the same active material weight 
as the DD-PMSG, but at around (above) 10 m interior stator diameters, which is less practical.
•	 The overall cost of generator + frame, etc., is only 7% lower for the DD-DFIG.
•	 However, it should be noted that the air gap of DFIG design was considered to be 1 (2) mm as the 
centrifugal forces are small (peripheral speed is below 10 m/s), and a special flexible framing was 
FEM designed and tested for mechanical stress [32]. A 2 mm air gap would be more practical even 
in such a frame design, but that would also mean a lower efficiency.
•	 The DD-DFIG has been designed for unity power factor (however, at 50 Hz), while the DD-PMSG 
with full power AC–AC converter can deliver full rated reactive power (even when the turbine is 
idling, when a back-to-back capacitor DC link voltage source converter is used).
•	 The today’s more than 100 $/kg price for NdFeB magnets considered in PMSG design, for 6 t of 
NdFeB magnets, means the DD-DFIG is even more attractive in terms of initial costs (Table 2.4).

Principles of Electric Generators
•	 The 25%–35% rated power transfer to the rotor through mechanical brushes for the DFIG also has 
to be considered together with DFIG inherent weakness in treating power grid deep voltage sags, 
and reactive power delivery limits.
In a further effort to sort out when, where, and which of the four standard wind generators are bet-
ter, from 0.75 MW (38.6 rpm) to 10 MW (10 rpm). Reference 33 attempts a solid but analytical design 
for DD-PMSG, DD-dceSG, 1G-PMSG, 1G-DFIG and 3G-SCIG, 3G-DFIG, and 3G-PMSG again with a 
NdFeB PM price of 53.2 $/kg. The results in Figure 2.34a and b [33] are safe-revealing, though again the 
cost of the converter is still considered in $/kW.
Figure 2.34 suggests again that in terms of kW h/$, the 3G-DFIG and the 1G-DFIG (multibrid) are 
better even at 10 MW (as it was for 3 MW), but the energy yield is smaller than at 3 MW. The DD-DFIG 
has not been considered in Reference [33]. In addition, it is notable that the 3G-CRIG is better than 
DD-PMSG or DD-dceSG in kW h/$. The much higher than 53.2 $/kg cost of NdFeB today makes the 
comparison even less favorable for the 1G and 3G PMSG.
As quite a few secondary effects such as magnetic saturation, losses, and torque pulsations have been 
indubitably coarsely treated in the even nonlinear analytical models in the optimal design [33], further 
2(3)D FEM studies have to be run, even with a few ones included in the optimal design cycle, before 
industry-usable knowledge is obtained. Reaching this point with the overview, a few questions arise:
•	 If the DD-dceSG is capable of producing full active and reactive power control in a reliable con-
figuration, which can stand severe voltage dips, why does it not become the norm in the MW 
range wind generators?: because it is too heavy, then the tower is heavier, etc., and the efficiency 
is moderately high probably 0.96 in the 7.5 MW dce DD-dceSG in the advanced development 
for a 220 t total generator weight (www.enercon.de); finally, the energy yield is lower at 10 MW, 
10 rpm.
•	 If the 1G-DFIG (probably also DD-DFIG) produces the same energy yield for lower cost and 
weight than DD or 1G-PMSG (and is implicitly better than DD-dce SG), why does it not become 
the norm itself? The main reason is that the 30%–40% rated dual AC–AC converter connected to 
the DFIG rotor does not allow full (plus/minus) reactive power control and cannot handle easily 
deep voltage sags, as it controls only 20%–30% of the active power firmly. In addition, at 30%–40% 
power rating, 3 MW for 10 MW machines needs to be transferred through slip rings and brushes, 
which in off-shore sites may become a challenge.

•)>> If the 3G-SCIG, which is brushless and robust, operates at reasonable cost and energy yield 
(Figure 2.33), even at 10 MW, and by using a full power dual AC–AC converter can provide ±100% 
active and reactive power control, why it does not become the norm? Mainly because, it implies a 
3G transmission that is bulky, requiring high diameter, heavy nacelle; it needs maintenance and, 
in case of oil spills, may produce sea water pollution in off-shore wind parks.
These questions led to the discussion in what follows, not only on the newly proposed solutions, but also 
to investigate variants and additions to DD-dceSG, 1G(DD) SCIG and brushless DFIG for off-shore high 
power units. In addition, it includes high speed (4G) on-shore solutions with dce SG, PMSG, for powers 
perhaps less than 3 MW/unit. The paper treats variants of DD-SG systems and 4G-SGs, less PM PMSGs,

Principles of Electric Generators
BLDC—multiphase reluctance generators, brushless DFIGs, brushless doubly fed reluctance generators, 
SRGs, flux-switching ferrite PM stator generators. Finally, conclusions are drawn.
The choice of these innovative recent proposals is based on their assumed practicality, judged by 
the results obtained thus far. But also based on the fact that a high internal, synchronous reactance 
(above 1.00 pu) exerts a strong burden on the PWM converter connected to the generator, leading to 
high conductive losses in the converter full load and to high converter switching losses at low load, due 
the known “large voltage regulation syndrome” (this is why qs = 1 windings may be preferred to qs < 0.5 
(fractionary) windings in PMSGs).
2.9.2  DC-Excited Synchronous Generator Systems
A typical DD-dce.SG with its generic power electronics grid interfacing is shown in Figure 2.35.
Besides, the bidirectional (in this embodiment) full-power PWM converter control through stator, an 
excitation converter of low power (less than 3% of the rating power) is provided to supply the excitation 
windings on the rotor through (in general) brushes and slip rings.
2.9.2.1  Brushless Excitation
To avoid brushes (especially for off-shore applications), a 500 Hz (or more) rotary transformer with a 
constant frequency and variable voltage inverter (3% power rating) in the primary side and a fast diode 
rectifier on SG rotor may replace the brush-based slip ring system within the same volume [34] and 
losses. Figure 2.36 shows the system.
The excitation current will be modified through the low power inverter voltage amplitude: the size 
of the rotary transformer is small at 500 Hz (or more) frequency and its small short-circuit reactance 
allows for fast field current control while its circular shape coils minimize the copper losses in it. The 
initial cost is still an issue.

2.9.2.2  Lower Size (Weight) by Optimal Design
With 41 t of active materials for DD at 3 MW and 15 rpm [30] and a total 220 t generator weight for 
7.5 MW at 10 rpm (www.enercon.de), there is little available information about DD-dce.SGs on the mar-
ket in terms of complete weight, cost and performance data. A dedicated optimal analytical design code 
with 2D FEM verifications was put in place and tried on a 5 MW, 12 rpm, 15 Hz, 6000 V, q = 1 slot/pole/
phase DD-dce.SG. Table 2.5 summarizes key data on this endeavor.
The aggregated cost and loss objective function evolution during the optimization design is visible in 
Figure 2.37a with the losses seen in Figure 2.37b.
A few remarks are necessary:
•)>> The active materials weight is reduced to 42.2 t at 5 MW, 12 rpm at the cost of a general rated effi-
ciency (excitation losses included) of 93% (Pcun = 114 kW, Piron + Pmec = 115 kW) by allowing a high 
rotor diameter Dro = 8.554 m, and an air gap g = 5 mm.
•)>> The machine synchronous (saturated) reactances are xd = 1.07 pu and xq = 0.929 pu. Consequently, 
the machine does not have the high voltage regulation problems, while the small saliency war-
rants rather pure iq control (id = 0), which means a voltage boosting through the machine side 
converter as in PMSGs and CRIGs. If unity power factor control is considered, id ≠ 0 under load 
and thus the copper losses will be larger than needed. In some simplified systems, a diode rectifier 
is used on the machine side with a DC link power controlled only by the field current. For small 
speed range cases (off-shore) such a compromise seems to be worth considering.

2.9.2.3  DD Superconducting Synchronous Generators
In efforts to reduce further the machine volume and weight, iron back core and air back core stator 
superconducting DC rotor excitation SGs have been vigorously investigated lately (Figure 2.38) [35,36].
About 20 t active materials designs for the air back core stator 10 MW, 0.833 Hz (10 poles), with 
low-temperature superconducting rotor SG inside a rotor diameter of 5 m and an efficiency of 96.4% 
have been proposed [37]. No data about the total cost of SC–SG systems are available thus far; but in 
terms of weight of active materials and efficiency, the solution is very interesting. However, it brings

along new challenges such as static power converters to operate properly at such a low fundamental 
frequency and at 10 MW of power. In addition, the lack of field current control for DC link power 
control, the rotor cooling and rotor SC replenishing with current periodically (daily) constitute addi-
tional problems to solve.
2.9.2.4  Claw Pole 1G-dce.SG (3 MW, 75 rpm)
The claw pole alternator makes most use of DC power excitation, which is, in general, three to four times 
smaller than in a machine with heteropolar DC excited, once the number of poles 2p1 > 10. It is inves-
tigated only for 1G–SG because the axial length is limited, and the configuration is most advantageous 
with a single rotor unit. A dedicated design methodology has been put in place for the claw pole SG and, 
for the 3 MW, 75 rpm, case study; the following results are shown in Table 2.6. Only a pre-optimization 
study was performed, but the results are worth considering.

Synchronous Generators
Ferrite PMs may be “planted” between the rotor poles of the SG or between the claw poles to focus 
better the excitation flux and de-saturate the rotor, thus bringing an additional 20%–25% output for 
same geometry and same losses [34,38,39] (see Figure 2.39).
2.9.2.5  Windformer
A high-voltage (40–60 kV) cable-stator-winding SG called “WINDFORMER” (ABB Review, vol. 3, 2000, 
pp. 31–37) has been proposed to eliminate the voltage matching transformer (and its full power switch) 
for the medium voltage required in power grids. These evident merits are partially compensated by the 
large insulation spaces inside the slots and to the frame, with a lower slot filling factor and thus larger 
copper losses, for a given stator geometry.
2.9.3  Less-PM PMSGs
As it has already been discussed thoroughly in the Introduction, the NdFeB PMSGs for both 1G and DD 
require large amounts of magnets (6 t for the DD-PMSG of 10 MW design at 10 rpm). An alternative will 
be investigated to reduce PM cost per kilowatt produced by PMSG. Among numerous proposals two are 
shown to have notable potential: the axial air-gap TF multiple rotor PMSG with circular stator coils and

ferrite PM flux concentration rotor modules (Ferrite TF-PMSG) and the super-speed modular PMSG 
with NdFeB at rotational speeds of 4000 rpm (high frequency and 4G transmission [250:1 ratio]).
2.9.3.1  Ferrite TF-PMSG with Axial Air Gap
A 3D view of a section of one phase of an axial air-gap Ferrite TF-PMSG is shown in Figure 2.40 and was 
investigated by the authors, for the scope, through a dedicated optimal design software for 3 MW, 15 rpm 
and compared, again, with the same case study, but using NdFeB and, again, with flux concentration.
The main results obtained from the simulations are summarized in Table 2.7.
The results in Table 2.7 indicate that the NdFeB machine is slightly superior in performance but, in 
terms of active material weight, the multiple rotor system is much lighter (the stator is almost the same 
as that of the ferrite PM rotor). In terms of total active materials cost the two solutions are 34% apart, 
while a high 133 $/kg NdFeB price was already considered. Apparently, only the scarcity of NdFeB can 
rule here in favor of the ferrite-PM machine. On the other hand, the 0.7–0.75 power factor indicates for 
both machines a large synchronous reactance in p.u. machine, which leads to higher inverter losses and 
to an increased inverter kV A rating (and costs); a special, controlled, rectifier structure is claimed to 
yield higher efficiency than the standard PWM rectifier on the machine side [40].

2.9.3.2  High-Speed Modular PMSG (4 × 0.75 MW, 4000 rpm)
For on-shore applications and probably up to 3 MW power, the generator may be split into a few (four) 
modules (340 kg each) that run at high speed (4000 rpm) [41]. But the required 260:1 ratio mechanical 
transmission has to be further improved by the reduction of volume and of outer diameter, to fit in to a 
reasonable diameter (weight) nacelle. The frequency of the generator may vary from 300 Hz to 1200 Hz 
(for 4 m/s to 16 m/s wind speed) [41] (see Figure 2.41).

Principles of Electric Generators
For such a high-speed solution, the PM weight per kilowatt is small and thus even NdFeB PMs could 
be cost-wise acceptable. The high frequency of PMSG voltage should provide low size in transformers 
while switched mode rectifiers (SMRs) perform the required control of the power delivered to the DC 
voltage link. A half bridge single-phase inverter is added to recover the capacitors’ energy by connecting 
the generator modules and transformers neutral points. With a single diode output rectifier, the solution 
seems very tempting in performance/cost terms, provided the challenging 260/1 gear ratio transmission 
can be built.
2.9.3.3  Flux Reversal PMSGs
In yet another variant of ferrite PM rotor and non-overlapping coils stator, a flux reversal PMSG can be 
built either with axial or with radial air gap. Similar performance may be obtained (see Figure 2.42) [42].

It is easier to manufacture than the TF-PMSG, but it has a high reactance (in pu) and larger copper losses 
(TF-PMSG with circular shape coils is the best in terms of Joule of losses/Nm).
The radial air-gap configuration may allow for a two-stator single-rotor construction, which is easier 
to manufacture, while the copper losses per kilowatt are still low. As the ferrite PM rotor stands to be 
long axially (see Figure 2.42a), in order to limit the machine volume, the solution may be tried especially 
in 1G or even 3G PMSGs, where the torque per kilowatt is lower than in the direct drive wind generators.
2.9.3.4  The Vernier Machine
A radial air-gap, PM-flux concentration rotor dual stator, similar to the one in Figure 2.42, for the reversal 
flux PMSG, has been proposed in the Vernier machine topology [43] with claims of high power factor 
for distributed stator windings with q = 2 slots per pole per phase (Figure 2.43). It is yet to be tried for 
wind generator applications, but it is evident that the copper losses tend to be a bit smaller in the flux 
reversal PMSG (Figure 2.42), though the use of stator core is better in the Vernier machine (Figure 2.43).

Principles of Electric Generators
This technology allows for the axial air-gap topologies when the two stators may be assembled easier, 
reducing the fabrication costs. Therefore, another variant is a dual stator axial–air gap, PMs flux concen-
tration (spoke magnet) rotor PMSG [44,45], as shown in Figure 2.44. This configuration allows the stator 
poles insertion one by one, reducing the fabrication cost of the machine. With 0.6 T, 450 kA/m PMs, the 
in situ magnetization pole by pole may be attempted, to further reduce the manufacturing difficulties. But 
the copper losses are not small enough such that for a 3 MW, 15 rpm direct-driven PMSG the efficiency is 
moderate (0.93) for low power factor (0.54), which implies over-rated PWM converter on the machine side.
2.9.4  Multiphase Reluctance Generators (BLDC-MRG)
BLDC-MRGs (brushless multiphase reluctance generators) in two-pole configuration come from, say, a 
12 slot DC brush machine single-layer winding rotor, where the excitation is stripped off and its brushes 
have been moved out from the neutral axis by a slot-pitch (to the stator pole corner [Figure 2.45a]). The 
equivalent BLDC-MRG with six phases is thus obtained if the mechanical commutation is replaced by 
electronic commutation (Figure 2.45b) and controlled as it is shown in Figure 2.45c,d.
Each current polarity (Figure 2.45c) has a field (ic) coil role part (when the coils of that phase fall 
between the rotor poles) and a torque (iT) coil role part, when the coils of that phase fall under rotor 
variable reluctance (salient) rotor [46–49]. The interaction of the excitation field (iF) and torque current 
(by iT) falls around 90 (close to ideal) to produce the torque Te in the m phase machine (mF—field phases, 
mT—torque phase; m = 6, mF = 2, mT = 4). The average torque is basically

The flat-top currents iF and iT may be equal to each other on a rather optimal design for all operation 
regimes (or different from each other when the speed range has to be further extended and for generating 
mode). The high saliency ratio of rotors, which will be realized by a multiple flux barrier rotor or by an 
axially laminated anisotropic (ALA) rotor, is needed to secure a low armature reaction (higher torque

density for a given saturation level of flux density in the stator teeth facing rotor pole tip); a not-so-small 
air gap is good as a compromise between torque density, efficiency and current commutation quickness.
It is evident that the flat top (BLDC-type) current reveals a good use of the inverter voltage (lower 
“equivalent” reactive power) and, with a high rotor saliency, small voltage regulation. The number of 
phases may be 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 15, and so forth, but the pole pitch increases with the number of phases. In 
addition, the multiphase inverter (Figure 2.45a) null current is smaller for an odd number of phases.
A proposal that divides the stator into four sectors, and uses 4 inverters that control the torque con-
tribution, quicker, by the torque currents iT and the air gap g0, slower, by the field currents iF provides 
for active magnetic levitation of the rotor, which should reduce drastically the generator structure 
(Figure 2.46 [42]).
A design case study for a 6 MW and 12 rpm direct-drive generator by using 2D FEM has led to FEM 
results as shown in Figure 2.47 with torque versus position as in Figure 2.46.
It is evident, as shown in Table 2.8, that the weight is acceptably low, while the copper losses make 
only 3% of output power: this means an efficiency by around 96% as the mechanical and iron losses 
(f1 N = 14 Hz) are considered to represent 1% of the output power.
Therefore, the performance looks good, except for the still relatively large torque pulsations (even 
after making the rotor of two pieces shifted by one slot pitch [skewing]). As the principle is sound, with 
all phases active and one phase-only commutating at any time, and the rotor has good manufactur-
ability (the speed is below 10 rpm), the BLDC-MRG, taking advantage of multiphase inverters in recent 
developments, using its implicit notable fault tolerance capacity, seems to deserve attention both in 
direct drives, but especially, in 1G (single-stage gear) or 3(4)G solutions for wind generators.
2.9.5  DFIG: Brushless?
For a 10 MW DFIG about 2–3 MW of power has to be transferred to (from) the rotor through slip-rings 
and mechanical brushes. Besides the arch-occurrence-danger and maintenance problems that are far 
from trivial, this mechanical transfer of power implies also at least 0.5% of full power as losses. As a full 
power transformer would exhibit about the same losses (efficiency 99.5%) at grid frequency (50/60 Hz) it

seems feasible to make the DFIG rotor as primary (full power) and then use the stator as secondary, fed 
through a dual PWM AC–AC converter system, designed at partial power rating (20%–30%). A rotary 
three-phase transformer with a low enough air gap (0.7–1 mm) designed for full power transfer to the 
rotor at grid frequency can retain an efficiency close to 99% for 1 kg/kW weight. The other transformer 
secondary placed on the stator (as the transformer primary) will feed the dual PWM converter that sup-
plies the DFIG stator winding at “slip frequency” and power: SmaxSn; Sn-DFIG rating (Figure 2.48). At the 
same time, the rotary transformer primary—all transformer coils show minimum copper loss due the 
blessing of circularity—may be designed at higher voltage, above 36 kV, to eliminate the matching volt-
age existing transformer, needed for interfacing the typical 0.69–6 kV wind generators.

Principles of Electric Generators
This brushless power transfer solution with full power transfer to the rotor at the grid frequency has 
the size of one transformer that would transfer the slip power (|SmaxSn|) at slip frequency f2 = Smaxf1, but 
it may provide the DFIG transition through synchronous speed naturally (the rotary transformer has 
been initially proposed to transfer the slip power to the rotor without brushes [50], but power transfer 
at zero slip is not feasible).
Moreover, a recent study has proven that the wound rotor induction machine designed with the rotor 
as primary (at full power) and stator as secondary (at slip power in terms of slot area, etc.) may result in a 
5%–6% size decrease and cost reduction [51]. The elimination of the brush system for full power transfer 
is not considered in [51]. For a 10 MW direct drive (DD) DFIG, where the active material weight is 65 t 
(by design), the addition of a 10 t (or less, with strong cooling) for the rotary transformer (for 10 MW 
at 50/60 Hz) may well be justified, especially if its primary is designed at above 30 kV, to provide direct 
interfacing with the middle-voltage local power grids.

directly to the power grid, while the control winding (sized at 20%–30% power rating) is fed through 
an AC–AC PWM converter, much like in DFIG (Figure 2.49). As the torque density is paramount in 
wind generators (Nm/kg), it has to be mentioned that the magnetic coupling “between each of the

Principles of Electric Generators
two windings and the rotor” takes place via an air-gap permeance space harmonic whose amplitude 
is less than 50% of its “DC” (main) level [53]. This means, inevitably, at best, moderate torque density. 
The magnetic coupling is thus weak and, consequently, each AC winding “reflects” an additional leak-
age-like reactance, which means a burden on the converter. A large air gap, inevitable in DD direct-
drive wind generators, is not favorable for this machine. Therefore, it may be tried first for 3G low and 
medium-power wind generators, through design optimization studies in which the converter losses 
and cost have to be considered as a whole.
2.9.7  Switched Reluctance Generator Systems [37,56,57]
There are few switched reluctance generator (SRG) designs for wind energy, related to low-power case 
studies [28] and to direct-drive SRG [10] at 6 MW, 12 rpm. In order to secure a large efficiency and a large 
torque density, the SRG requires small air gap and large stator/rotor pole span. However, in DD-SRGs, 
a large number of rotor poles provide high torque copper losses, if the phase coils have a circular shape; 
and up to the point where the flux fringing increases ruins it, when the rotor pole span/air gap decreases 
too much.
2.9.7.1  DD-SRG
It has been calculated that in a DD-SRG design (using FEM) with 4 mm air gap, 9.0 m interior stator 
diameter, at a frequency of 175 Hz, the saliency ratio goes down to Lunaligned/Laligned = 0.6 and thus the 
machine magnetization within 33% of the energy cycle time requires a 10/1 forcing voltage, which is 
unprac­tical [37]. This explains why for DD-SRG at 6 MW, 12 rpm power range DC excitation coils (which 
span three AC coils) on the stator are added, to produce a homopolar flux density that should vary from 
1.5 T in aligned position and less than to 0.5 T for unaligned position. This is necessary for sufficient AC 
emf in the tooth-wound winding phase coils, which now are flowed by bipolar currents like in any stator 
excited SG. It has also been shown [37] that the SRG configuration (Figure 2.51a) is capable to produce 
6 MW at 12 rpm, with an air gap of 4 mm at 9.0 m interior stator diameter and 1.5 m stack length and 
80 t of active materials, but the total DC + AC losses are 1.5 MW, which means the solution is unpracti-
cal (80% efficiency). If a TF six-phase configuration is instead chosen (see Figure 2.50b,c) the design [37] 
will produce the required torque of 5.5 M N m (and more, see Figure 2.50c) for 240 kW of total (DC + 
AC coils losses).

Synchronous Generators
This leads to at least 94% of the total efficiency [37]. To avoid voltage induced by the AC coils in the 
DC coils [37] and thus reduce the voltage (and kV A) of the DC–DC converter that controls the DC 
(excitation) coils, the latter should first be connected in series. Unfortunately, the 4 mm air gap means a 
large p.u. reactance of the machine, which again means a burden of the converter kV A. In addition, the 
homo-polar character of the magnetic DC field in all stator poles implies higher than necessary normal 
(radial) forces. A lot is to be done in order to prove the practicality of the TF circular DC + AC coils sta-
tor for DD high-power wind generators (machine +converter +control) in terms of cost/performance, 
to prove their practicality.
2.9.7.2  High-Speed Wind SRG
On the other hand, for 1500–4000 rpm 3(4)G-SRG, the standard [56] or dual-stator segmented pole sec-
ondary [58] configurations (Figure 2.51) have already been proven to be capable of high torque density 
(45 Nm/l) at above 92% efficiency at 50 kW and more for HEV, and should be considered for high-speed 
wind generators for more reliable and lower cost and, at the same time, good torque density (reason-
able weight). The 100(260)/1 ratio transmission has to be provided as usual for such systems, as in multi 
modular generator (4× 0.75 MW modules for 3 MW, as proposed with PMSGs [41]), which may be more 
feasible: “easy to say but difficult to do.”

2.9.8  Flux-Switch Ferrite PM Stator Generators
The stator PM flux switching double salient motors have been proven recently to produce a good torque 
density in industrial drives with stator NdFeB [59–61] or with hybrid stator excitation [62,63]. Already in 
Reference [63], it has been proposed to use the PM ferrite stator flux switch machine for wind generators 
(see Figure 2.52), even though in a low power design example.
Table 2.9 shows a comparison of the performance of a PMSG and a low-power PM ferrite flux switch 
generator [63] at 30 rpm.

Synchronous Generators
The efficiency is rather low (70%) at 30 rpm and 1000 Nm (1150 W losses for 5 kW of wind power). 
But extrapolating this design (using same torque) at 1500 rpm would mean, with doubled losses 
(due to higher core and some mechanical losses), an efficiency of about 96%. Also in this latter case, 
the weight of active materials corresponds to 1 kW/kg, which is a rather large value. Consequently, 
the solution deserves to be investigated further for 3(4)G-high speed modular wind generators. 
Not so, in our view, for high power DD wind generators, because the air gap is large and because 
the radial-long Ferrite PMs, needed in such a case for strong flux concentration, means too large 
an extra core. On the other hand, the ferrite-rotor double salient generator [64] may allow enough 
room for strong ferrite PM flux concentration with less extra weight in the rotor and thus yield a 
competitive direct drive wind generator along with this principle (Figure 2.53). It remains to be 
seen if the promises of a large torque density in Reference 64 may be duplicated in a large diameter 
(3 mm air gap) DD wind generators while the converter has to deal with bipolar currents whose 
summation is not zero.

2.10  Summary
In this chapter, we have presented some representative—in use and newly proposed—types of electric 
generators by principle, configuration, and application.
A few concluding remarks are in order:
•	 The power per unit range varies from a few mW to a few hundred megawatts (even 1500 MV A) 
per unit.
•	 Large power generators—above a few MW—are electrically excited on the rotor either DC, as in 
conventional synchronous generator (SG), or in three-phase AC, as in the wound rotor (doubly 
fed) induction generator (WRIG).
•	 While the conventional DC rotor-excited SG requires tightly controlled constant speed to pro-
duce constant frequency output, the WRIG may work with adjustable speed.
•	 The rating of the rotor-connected PWM converter in WRIG is about equal to the adjustable speed 
range (slip), in general around 20%. This implies reasonable costs for a more flexible generator 
with fast active and reactive power (or frequency and voltage) control.
•	 WRIG seems the way of the future in electric generation at adjustable speed for powers above a 
few megawatts, in general, per unit.
•	 PMSGs are emerging for kW, tenth of kW, even hundreds of kilowatts or 1–10 MW/unit in special 
applications such as automotive starter-alternators or super-high-speed gas turbine generators or 
DD wind generators, respectively.
•	 LMAs are emerging for power operation up to 15, even 50 kW for home or special series hybrid 
vehicles, with linear gas combustion engines and electric propulsion.
•	 Parametric generators are being investigated for special applications: SRGs for aircraft jet engine 
starter-alternators and TFGs/motors for hybrid or electrical bus propulsion or directly driven 
wind generators.
•	 Section 2.9 illustrates in detail the myriad of generators’ topologies for wind (and small hydro) 
energy conversion; vehicular (stand-alone) generators on aircraft, ship, on-road vehicles, etc. are 
under very dynamic scrutiny, also.
•	 Electric generators are driven by different prime movers that have their own characteristics, per-
formance, and mathematical models, which, in turn, influence the generator operation since at 
least speed control is enacted upon the prime mover. Chapter 3 dwells in some detail on most 
used prime movers with their characteristics, mathematical models, and speed control methods.

Prime Movers
3.1  Introduction
Electric generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Mechanical energy is produced by 
prime movers. Prime movers are mechanical machines that convert primary energy of a fuel or fluid 
into mechanical energy. They are also called “turbines or engines.” The fossil fuels commonly used in 
prime movers are coal, gas, oil, and nuclear fuel.
Essentially, the fossil fuel is burned in a combustor and thus thermal energy is produced.
Thermal energy is then taken by a working fluid and converted into mechanical energy in the prime 
mover itself.
Steam is the working fluid for coal or nuclear fuel turbines, but it is the gas or oil in combination with 
air, in gas turbines, diesel, or internal combustion engines.
On the other hand, the potential energy of water from an upper-level reservoir may be converted 
into kinetic energy that hits the runner of a hydraulic turbine, changes momentum and direction, and 
produces mechanical work at the turbine shaft as it rotates against the “braking” torque of the electric 
generator under electric load.
Wave energy is similarly converted into mechanical work in special tidal hydraulic turbines. Wind 
kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy by wind turbines.
A complete classification of prime movers is very difficult due to so many variations in construction, 
from topology to control. However, a simplified one is shown in Table 3.1.
In general, a prime mover or turbine drives an electric generator directly, or through a transmission 
(Figure 3.1) [1–3]. The prime mover is necessarily provided with a so-called speed governor (in fact, a 
speed control and protection system) that properly regulates the speed, according to electric generator 
frequency/power curves (Figure 3.2).
Note that the turbine is provided with a servomotor that activates one or a few control valves that reg-
ulate the fuel (or fluid) flow in the turbine, thus controlling the mechanical power at the turbine shaft.
The speed at turbine shaft is measured rather precisely and compared with the reference speed. The 
speed controller then acts on the servomotor to open or close control valves and control speed. The ref-
erence speed is not constant. In AC power systems, with generators in parallel, a speed droop of 2%–3% 
is allowed with power increased to rated value.
The speed droop is required for two reasons as follows:
	
1.	 With a few generators of different powers in parallel, fair (proportional) power load sharing is 
provided.
	
2.	 When power increases too much, the speed decreases accordingly signaling that the turbine has 
to be shut off.
The point A of intersection between generator power and turbine power in Figure 3.2 is statically stable 
as any departure from it would provide the conditions (through motion equation) to return to it.

Prime Movers
With synchronous generators operating in a rather constant voltage and frequency power system, 
the speed droop is very small, which implies strong strains on the speed governor—due to large iner-
tia, etc. It also leads to not-so-fast power control. On the other hand, the use of doubly fed synchro-
nous generators, or of AC generators with full power electronics between them and the power system, 
would allow for speed variation (and control) in larger ranges (±20% and more). That is, smaller speed 
reference for smaller power. Power sharing between electric generators would then be done through 
power ­electronics in a much faster and more controlled manner. Once these general aspects of prime 
mover requirements have been clarified, let us deal in some detail with prime movers in terms of prin-
ciple, steady-state performance and models for transients. The main speed governors and their dynamic 
­models are also included for each main type of prime movers investigated here.
3.2  Steam Turbines
Coal, oil, or nuclear fuels are burned to produce high pressure (HP), high temperature, steam in a boiler. 
The potential energy in the steam is then converted into mechanical energy in the so-called axial flow 
steam turbines.
The steam turbines contain stationary and rotating blades grouped into stages—HP, intermediate 
pressure (IP), low pressure (LP). The HP steam in the boiler is let to enter—through the main emergency 
stop valves (MSVs) and the governor valves (GVs)—the stationary blades where it is accelerated as it 
expands to a lower pressure (LP) (Figure 3.3). Then the fluid is guided into the rotating blades of the 
steam turbine where it changes momentum and direction thus exerting a tangential force on the turbine 
rotor blades. Torque on the shaft and, thus, mechanical power, are produced. The pressure along the 
turbine stages decreases and thus the volume increases. Consequently, the length of the blades is lower 
in the HP stages than in the lower power stages.

Synchronous Generators
The two, three, or more stages (HP, IP, and LP) are all, in general, on same shaft, working in tan-
dem. Between stages the steam is reheated; its enthalpy is increased and thus the overall efficiency is 
improved, up to 45% for modern coal-burn steam turbines.
Nonreheat steam turbines are built below 100 MW, while single-reheat and double-reheat steam 
­turbines are common above 100 MW, in general.
The single-reheat tandem (same shaft) steam turbine is shown in Figure 3.3.
There are three stages in Figure 3.3: HP, IP, and LP. After passing through MSV and GV, the HP steam 
flows through the HP stage where its experiences a partial expansion. Subsequently, the steam is guided 
back to the boiler and reheated in the heat exchanger to increase its enthalpy. From the reheater, the 
steam flows through the reheat emergency stop valve (RSV) and intercept valve (IV) to the IP stage of 
the turbine where again it expands to do mechanical work. For final expansion, the steam is headed to 
the crossover pipes and through the LP stage where more mechanical work is done.
Typically, the power of the turbine is divided as 30% in the HP, 40% in the IP, and 30% in the LP stages.
The governor controls both the GV in the HP stage, and the IV in the IP stage, to provide fast and 
safe control.
During steam turbine starting—toward synchronous generator synchronization—the MSV is fully 
open while the GV and IV are controlled by the governor system to regulate the speed and power. The 
governor system contains a hydraulic (oil) or an electrohydraulic servomotor to operate the GV and IV 
but also to control the fuel–air mix admission and its parameters in the boiler.
The MSV and RSV are used to stop quickly and safely the turbine under emergency conditions.
Turbines with one shaft are called tandem-compound while those with two shafts (eventually at 
­different speeds) are called cross-compound. In essence, the LP stage of the turbine is attributed to a 
separate shaft (Figure 3.4).

Controlling the speeds and powers of two shafts is rather difficult though it brings more flexibility. 
Also shafts are shorter. Tandem-compound (single shaft) configurations are more often used. Nuclear 
units have in general tandem-compound (single-shaft) configurations and run at 1800 (1500) rpm for 60 
(50) Hz power systems.They contain one HP and three LP stages (Figure 3.5).
The HP exhaust passes through the moisture reheater (MSR) before entering the LP (LP 1,2,3) stages, 
to reduce steam moisture losses and erosion.The HP exhaust is also reheated by the HP steam flow.
The governor acts upon GV and IV 1,2,3 to control the steam admission in the HP and LP 1,2,3 stages 
while MSV, RSV 1,2,3 are used only for emergency tripping of the turbine. 
In general, the governor (control) valves are of the plug-diffuser type, while the IV may be either plug 
or butterfly type (Figure 3.6). The valve characteristics are partly nonlinear and, for better control, are 
often “linearized” through the control system.
3.3  Steam Turbine Modeling
The complete model of a multiple-stage steam turbine is rather involved. This is why we present here 
first the simple steam vessel (boiler, reheater) model (Figure 3.7) [1–3], and derive the power expression 
for the single-stage steam turbine.
V is the volume (m3), Q is the steam mass flow rate (kg/s), ρ is the density of steam (kg/m3), and W is 
the weight of the steam in the vessel (kg).
The mass continuity equation in the vessel is written as follows:

Now consider the rather complete model of a single-reheat, tandem-compound steam turbine 
(Figure 3.8). We will follow the steam journey through the turbine, identifying a succession of time 
delays/time constants.
The MVS and RSV (stop) valves are not shown in Figure 3.8 because they intervene only in emergency 
conditions.
The governor (control) valves modulate the steam flow through the turbine to provide for the required 
(reference) load (power)/frequency (speed) control.
The GV has a steam chest where substantial amounts of steam are stored, also in the inlet piping. 
Consequently, the response of steam flow to a change in GV opening exhibits a time delay due to the 
charging time of the inlet piping and steam chest. This time delay is characterized by a time constant 
TCH in the order of 0.2–0.3 s.
The IV are used for rapid control of mechanical power (they handle 70% of power) during overspeed 
conditions, and thus their delay time may be neglected in a first approximation.
The steam flow in the IP and LP stages may be changed with the increase of pressure in the reheater. 
As the reheater holds a large amount of steam, its response time delay is larger. An equivalent larger time 
constant TRM of 5–10 s is characteristic to this delay.
The crossover piping also introduces a delay that may be characterized by another time constant TCO.

78
Synchronous Generators
We should also consider that the HP, IP, LP stages produce FHP, FIP, FLP fractions of total turbine 
power such that:
)>>
FHP + FIP + FLP = 1)>>
(3.9)
We may integrate these aspects of steam turbine model into a structural diagram as in Figure 3.9.
Typically, as already stated: FHP = FIP = 0.3, FLP = 0.4, TCH ≈ 0.2–0.3 s, TRH = 5–9 s, TCO = 0.4–0.6 s.
In a nuclear–fuel steam turbine, the IP stage is missing (FIP = 0, FLP = 0.7) and TRH and TCH are notably 
smaller.
As TCH is largest, reheat turbines tend to be slower than nonreheat turbines.

The transfer function in Equation 3.10 clearly shows that the steam turbine has a straightforward 
response to GV opening.
A typical response in torque (in PU)—or in power—to 1 s ramp of 0.1 (p.u.) change in GV opening is 
shown in Figure 3.10 for TCH = 8 s, FHP = 0.3, and TCH = TCO = 0.
Enhanced steam turbine models involving various details, such as IV more rigorous representation 
counting for the (fast) pressure difference across the valve, may be required to better model various 
intricate transient phenomena.
3.4  Speed Governors for Steam Turbines
The governor system of a turbine performs a multitude of functions such as the following:
•	 Speed (frequency)/load (power) control: mainly through GV
•	 Overspeed control: mainly through IV
•	 Overspeed trip: through MSV and RSV
•	 Start-up and shutdown
The speed/load (frequency/power) control (Figure 3.2) is achieved through the control of the GV to 
­provide linearly decreasing speed with load, with a small speed droop of 3%–5%. This function allows 
for paralleling generators with adequate load sharing.
Following a reduction in electrical load, the governor system has to limit the overspeed to a maxi-
mum of 120%, in order to preserve the turbine integrity.
Reheat-type steam turbines have two separate valving groups (GV and IV) to rapidly control the 
steam flow to the turbine.
The objective of the overspeed control is set to about 110%–115% of rated speed to prevent overspeed 
tripping of the turbine in case a load rejection condition occurs.
The emergency tripping (through MSV and RSV; Figures 3.3 and 3.5) is a protection solution in case 
normal and overspeed controls fail to limit the speed below 120%.
A steam turbine is provided with four or more governor (control) valves that admit steam through 
nozzle sections distributed around the periphery of the HP stage.

Synchronous Generators
In normal operation, the GVs are open sequentially to provide better efficiency at partial load. During 
the start-up, all the GVs are fully open and stop valves control the steam admission.
Governor systems for steam turbines evolved continuously, from mechanical–hydraulic to electro-
hydraulic ones [4].
In some embodiments, the main governor systems activate and control the GV while an ­auxiliary 
governor system operates and controls the IV [4]. A mechanical–hydraulic governor contains, in 
­general, a centrifugal speed governor (controller) whose effect is amplified through a speed relay to open 
the steam valves. The speed relay contains a pilot valve (activated by the speed governor) and a spring-
loaded servomotor (Figure 3.11).
In electrohydraulic turbine governor systems, the speed governor and speed relay are replaced by 
electronic controls and an electric servomotor that finally activates the steam valve.
In large turbines, an additional level of energy amplification is needed. Hydraulic servomotors are 
used for the scope (Figure 3.12).
Combining the two stages—the speed relay and the hydraulic servomotor—the basic turbine gover-
nor is obtained (Figure 3.13).
For a speed droop of 4% at rated power, KSR = 25 (Figure 3.13). A similar structure may be used to 
control the IV [2].
Electrohydraulic governor systems perform similar functions; but by using electronics control in the 
lower power stages, they bring more flexibility and faster and more robust response.
They are, in general, provided with acceleration detection and load power unbalance relay compensation.
The structure of a generic electrohyraulic governor system is shown in Figure 3.14.
We should notice the two stages in actuation: the electrohydraulic converter plus the servomotor and 
the electronic speed controller.

The development of modern nonlinear control (adaptive, sliding mode, fuzzy, neural networks, H∞, 
etc.) has led to a wide variety of recent electronic speed controllers or total steam turbine-generator 
controllers [5,6]. However, they fall beyond our scope here.
3.5  Gas Turbines
Gas turbines burn gas, whose thermal energy is converted into mechanical work. Air is used as the 
working fluid. There are many variations in gas turbine topology and operation [1], but the most com-
monly used seems to be the open regenerative cycle type (Figure 3.15).

Synchronous Generators
The gas turbine in Figure 3.14 consists of an air compressor (C) driven by the turbine itself (T) and 
the combustion chamber (CH).
The fuel enters the CH through the GV where it is mixed with the hot-compressed air from ­compressor. 
The combustion product is then directed into the turbine where it expands and transfers energy to the 
moving blades of the gas turbine. The exhaust gas heats the air from compressor in the heat exchanger. 
The typical efficiency of a gas turbine is 35%. More complicated cycles such as compressor intercooling 
and reheating or intercooling with regeneration and recooling are used for further (slight) improve-
ments in performance [1].
The combined-gas and steam-cycle gas turbines have been proven recently to deliver an efficiency of 
55% or even slightly more. The generic combined cycle gas turbine is shown in Figure 3.16.
The exhaust heat from the gas turbine is directed through the heat recovery boiler (HRB) to produce steam, 
which, in turn, is used to produce more mechanical power through a steam turbine section on same shaft.
With the gas exhaust exiting the gas turbine above 500°C and additional fuel burning, the HRB 
­temperature may rise further the temperature of the HP steam and thus increase efficiency more.
Additionally, some steam for home (office) heating or process industries may be delivered.
Already in the tens of megawatts, combined cycle gas turbines are becoming popular for cogenera-
tion and in distributed power systems in the megawatt or even tenth and hundreds of kilowatt per unit.
Besides efficiency, the short construction time, low capital cost, low SO2 emission, little staffing, and 
easy fuel (gas) handling are all main merits of combined cycle gas turbines.
Their construction at very high speeds (tens of krpm) up to 10 MW range, with full power electronics 
between the generator and the distributed power grid, or in standalone operation mode at 50(60) Hz, 
make the gas turbines a way of the future in this power range.

3.6  Diesel Engines
Distributed electric power systems, with distribution feeders at 12 kV (or around it), standby power sets 
ready for quich intervention in case of emergency or on vessels, locomotives or series or parallel hybrid 
vehicles, or for power leveling systems in tandem with wind generators make use of diesel (or internal 
combustion) engines as prime movers for their electric generators. The power per unit varies from a few 
tenth of kilowatts to a few megawatts.
As for steam or gas turbines, the speed of diesel-engine generator set is controlled through a speed 
governor. The dynamics and control of fuel–air mix admission is very important to the quality of the 
electric power delivered to the local power grid or to the connected loads, in standalone applications.
3.6.1  Diesel Engine Operation

The firing angles for a 12 cylinder diesel engine are illustrated in Figure 3.17a, while the two-revolution 
sequence is: intake (I), compression (C), power (P), and exhaust (E) (see Figure 3.17b).
The 12-cylinder timing is shown in Figure 3.18.
There are 3 cylinders out of 12 firing simultaneously at steady state.
The resultant shaft torque of one cylinder varies with shaft angle as in Figure 3.19.
The compression torque is negative while during power cycle it is positive.
With 12 cylinders, the torque will have much smaller pulsations, with 12 peaks over 720° (period of 
power engine stroke); Figure 3.20.
Any misfire in one or a few of the cylinders would produce severe pulsations in the torque that would 
reflect as flicker in the generator output voltage [8].
Large diesel engines are provided, in general, with a turbocharger (Figure 3.21) which influences 
notably the dynamic response to perturbations by its dynamics and inertia [9].
The turbocharger is essentially an air compressor that is driven by a turbine that runs on the engine 
exhaust gas.
The compressor provides compressed air to the engine cylinders. The turbocharger works as an 
energy recovery device with about 2% power recovery.

3.6.2  Diesel Engine Modeling
The general structure diagram of a diesel engine with turbocharger and control is shown in Figure 3.22.
The most important components are as follows:
•	 The actuator (governor) driver that appears as a simple gain K3.
•	 The actuator (governor) fuel controller that converts the actuator’s driver into an equivalent fuel-

•	 The diesel engine is represented by the steady-state gain K1, constant for low fuel–flow Ф and 
saturated for large Ф, multiplied by the equivalence ratio factor (erf) and by a time constant τ1.
•	 The erf depends on engine equivalence ratio (eer) which in turn is the ratio of fuel/air normal-
ized by its stoichiometric value. A typical variation of erf with eer is also shown in Figure 3.22. In 
essence erf is reduced, because when the ratio fuel/air increases, incomplete combustion occurs, 
leading to low torque and smoky exhaust.
•	 The dead time of the diesel engine comprises three delays: the time elapsed until the actuator 
output actually injects fuel in the cylinder, fuel burning time to produce torque, and time until all 
cylinders produce torque at engine shaft:

The turbocharger acts upon the engine in the following ways:
•	 It draws energy from the exhaust to run its turbine; the more fuel in engine the more exhaust is 
available.
•	 It compresses air at a rate that is a nonlinear function of speed; the compressor is driven by the 
turbine, and thus the turbine speed and ultimate erf in the engine is influenced by the air flow rate.
•	 The turbocharger runs freely at high speed, but it is coupled through a clutch to the engine at low 
speeds, to be able to supply enough air at all speeds; the system inertia changes thus at low speeds, 
by including the turbocharger inertia.
Any load change leads to transients in the system pictured in Figure 3.22 that may lead to oscillations 
due to the nonlinear effects of fuel–air flow erf inertia. As a result, there will be either less or too much 
air in the fuel mix. In the first case, smoky exhaust will be apparent while in the second situation not 
enough torque will be available for the electric load, and the generator may pull out of synchronism.

This situation indicates that PI controllers of engine speed are not adequate and nonlinear controllers 
(adaptive, variable structure, etc.) are required.
A higher-order model may be adopted both for the actuator [11,12] and for the engine [13] to better 
simulate in detail the diesel engine performance for transients and control.
3.7  Stirling Engines
Stirling engines are part of the family of thermal engines: steam turbines, gas turbines, spark-ignited 
engines, and diesel engines. They all have already been described briefly in this chapter, but it is now 
time to dwell a little on the thermodynamic engines cycles to pave the way to Stirling engines.
3.7.1  Summary of Thermodynamic Basic Cycles
The steam engine, invented by James Watt, is a continuous combustion machine. Subsequently, the 
steam is directed from the boiler to the cylinders (Figure 3.23).
The typical four steps of the steam engine (Figure 3.23) are as follows:
	
1	 →  2 The isochoric compression (1–1′) followed by isothermal expansion (1′–2). The hot steam enters 
the cylinder through the open valve at constant volume; then, it expands at constant temperature.
	
2	 →  3 Isotropic expansion: once the valve is closed the expansion goes on till the maximum volume (3).
	
3	 →  1 Isochoric heat regeneration (3–3′) and isothermal compression (3′–4)—the pressure drops at 
constant volume and then the steam is compressed at constant temperature.
	
4	 →  1 Isentropic compression takes place after the valve is closed and the gas is mechanically compressed.
An approximate formula for thermal efficiency ηth is [13]:

The gas turbine engine fuel is also continuously combusted in combination with precompressed air. 
The gas expansion turns the turbine shaft to produce mechanical power.
The gas turbines work on a Brayton cycle (Figure 3.24).
The four steps include the following:
	
1	 →  2 Isentropic compression
	
2	 →  3 Isobaric input of thermal energy
	
3	 →  4 Isentropic expansion (work generation)
	
4	 →  1 Isobaric thermal energy loss

Gas turbines are more compact than other thermal machines; they are easy to start, have low vibrations, 
have low efficiency at low loads (ρ small), and tend to have poor behavior during transients.
The spark-ignited (Otto) engines work on the cycle in Figure 3.25.
The four steps are as follows:
	
1	 →  2—Isentropic compression
	
2	 →  3—Isochoric input of thermal energy
	
3	 →  4—Isentropic expansion (kinetic energy output)
	
4	 →  1—Isochoric heat loss

Efficiency decreases when load ρ increases, in contrast to spark-ignited engines for same ε. Lower com-
pression ratios (ε) than for spark-ignited engine are characteristic for diesel engines to obtain higher 
thermal efficiency.
3.7.2  Stirling Cycle Engine
The Stirling engine (born in 1816) is a piston engine with continuous heat supply (Figure 3.27).
In some respect, Stirling cycle is similar to Carnot cycle (with its two isothermal steps). It contains 
two opposed pistons and a regenerator in between.
The regenerator is made in the form of strips of metal. One of the two volumes is the expansion space 
kept at the high temperature Tmax, while the other volume is the compression space kept at low tempera-
ture Tmin. Thermal axial conduction is considered negligible. Let us suppose that the working fluid (all 
of it) is in the cold compression space.
During compression (1–2), the temperature is kept constant because heat is extracted from the com-
pression space cylinder to the surroundings.
During the transfer step (2–3), both pistons move simultaneously; the compression piston moves 
toward the regenerator, while the expansion piston moves away from it. Thus, the volume stays con-
stant. The working fluid is consequently transferred through the porous regenerator from compres-
sion to expansion space, and is heated from Tmin to Tmax. An increase in pressure takes place also from 
2 to 3. In the expansion step 3–4, the expansion piston still moves away from the regenerator, but the 
compression piston stays idle at inner dead point. The pressure decreases and the volume increases, but 
the temperature stays constant because heat is added from an external source. Then, again, a transfer 
step (4–1) occurs, with both pistons moving simultaneously to transfer the working fluid (at constant 
volume) through the regenerator from the expansion to the compression space. Heat is transferred from 
the working fluid to the regenerator, which cools at Tmin in the compression space.
The ideal thermal efficiency ηth is

Therefore, it is heavily dependent on the maximum and minimum temperatures as the Carnot cycle is. 
Practical Stirling-type cycles depart from the ideal one. Practical efficiency of Stirling cycle engines is 
much lower: h

Stirling engines may use any heat source and can use various working fuels such as air, hydrogen, or 
helium (with hydrogen the best and air the worst).
Typical total efficiencies versus HP/liter density are shown in Figure 3.28 [14] for three working fluids 
at various speeds.

91
Prime Movers
As the power and speed go up, the power density decreases. Methane may be a good replacement for 
air for better performance.
Typical power/speed curves of Stirling engines with pressure p are shown in Figure 3.29a. While the 
power of a potential electric generator, with speed, and voltage V as parameter, appear in Figure 3.29b.
The intersection at A of Stirling engine and electric generator power/speed curves looks clearly like 
a stable steady-state operation point. There are many variants for rotary-motion Stirling engines [14].
3.7.3  Free-Piston Linear-Motion Stirling Engine Modeling
Free-piston linear-motion Stirling engines were rather recently developed (by Sunpower and STC 
­companies) for linear generators for spacecraft or for home electricity production (Figure 3.30) [15].

to linear reciprocating electric generators. It suffices to say here that at least in the kilowatt range such 
a combination has been proven stable in stand-alone or power-grid-connected electric generator opera-
tion modes.
The merits and demerits of Stirling engines are as follows:
•	 Independence of heat source: fossil fuels, solar energy

3.8  Hydraulic Turbines
Hydraulic turbines convert the water energy of rivers into mechanical work at the turbine shaft. River 
water energy or tidal (wave) sea energy are renewable. They are the results of water circuit in nature, and, 
respectively, are gravitational (tide energy).
Hydraulic turbines are one of the oldest prime movers that man has used.
The energy agent and working fluid is water: in general, the kinetic energy of water (Figure 3.32). Wind 
turbines are similar, but the wind air kinetic energy replaces the water kinetic energy. Wind turbines will be 
treated separately, however, due to their many particularities. Hydraulic turbines are, in general, only prime 
movers, that is motors. There are also reversible hydraulic machines that may operate either as a turbine or 
as pump. They are also called hydraulic turbine pumps. There are also hydrodynamic transmissions made 
of two or more conveniently mounted hydraulic machines in a single frame. They play the role of mechani-
cal transmissions but have active control. Hydrodynamic transmissions fall beyond our scope here.

Hydraulic turbines are of two main types: impulse turbines for heads above 300–400 m and reac-
tion turbines for heads below 300 m. A more detailed classification is related to main direction of 
the water particles in the rotor zone: bent axially or transverse to the rotor axis, or related to the 
inventor (Table 3.3). In impulse turbines, the run is at atmospheric pressure and all pressure drop 
occurs in the nozzles where potential energy is turned into kinetic energy of water that hits the 
runner.
In reaction turbines, the pressure in the turbine is above the atmospheric one; water supplies energy 
in both potential and kinetic form to the runner.
3.8.1  Basics of Hydraulic Turbines
The terminology in hydraulic turbines is related to variables and characteristics [16]. The main variables 
are of geometrical and functional type:
•	 Rotor diameter Dr (m)
•	 General sizes of the turbine
•	 Turbine gross head: HT (m)
•	 Specific energy YT = gHT (J/kg)
•	 Turbine input flow rate: Q (m3/s)
•	 Turbine shaft torque: TT (N m)
•	 Turbine shaft power: PT, W (kW, MW)
•	 Rotor speed ΩT (rad/s)
•	 Liquid (rotor properties): density ρ (kg/m3), cinematic viscosity ν (m2/s), temperature T (°C), and 
elasticity module E (N/m2)

In general, Gsp ≈ 70–150 N/kW.
In general the rotor diameter Dr = 0.2–12.0 m, the head HT = 2–2000 m, the efficiency at full load is 
ηT = 0.8–0.96, the flow rate Q = 10–3–103 m3/s, rotor speed n ≈ 50–1000 rpm.
Typical variations of efficiency [16] with load are given in Figure 3.33.
The maximum efficiency [16] depends on the specific speed ns and on the type of the turbine—Figure 3.34.
The specific speed is a good indicator for of the best type of turbine for a specific hydraulic site. 
In general, nSopt = 2–64 for Pelton turbines, ns = 50–500 for Francis turbines and ns = 400–1700 for 

97
Prime Movers
Kaplan turbines. The specific speed ns could be changed by changing the rotor speed n, the total power 
division in multiple turbines rotors or injectors and the turbine head.
The tendency is to increase nS in order to reduce turbine size, by increasing rotor speed, at the costs 
of higher cavitation risk.
As expected, the efficiency of all hydraulic turbines tends to be high at rated load. At part load Pelton 
turbines show better efficiency. The worst at part load is the Francis turbine. It is thus the one more suit-
able for variable speed operation. Basic topologies for Pelton, Francis, and Kaplan turbines are shown 
in Figure 3.35a–c.
In the high head, impulse (Pelton) turbine, the HP water is converted into high-velocity water jets by 
a set of fixed nozzles. The high-speed water jets hit the bowl-shaped buckets placed around the turbine 
runner and thus mechanical torque is produced at turbine shaft.
The area of the jet is controlled by a needle placed in the center of the nozzle. The needle is actuated 
by the turbine governor (servomotor).
In the event of sudden load reduction, the water jet is deflected from the buckets by a jet deflector 
(Figure 3.35a).

Synchronous Generators
In contrast, reaction (radial–axial) or Francis hydraulic turbines (Figure 3.35b) use lower head, high 
volumes of water and run at lower speeds.
The water enters the turbine from the intake passage or penstock, through a spiral chamber, passes 
then through the movable wicket gates onto the turbine runner and then, through the draft tube, to the 
tail water reservoir.
The wicket gates have their axis parallel to the turbine axis. In Francis turbines, the upper ends of the 
rotor blades are tightened to a crown and the lower ends to a band.
At even lower head, in Kaplan hydraulic turbines, the rotor blades are adjustable through an oil 
­servomotor placed within the main turbine shaft.
3.8.2  First-Order Ideal Model for Hydraulic Turbines
Usually, in system stability studies [17], with the turbine coupled to an electrical generator connected to 
a power grid, a simplified, classical model of the hydraulic turbine is used. Such a lossless model assumes 
that water is incompressible, the penstock is inelastic, the turbine power is proportional to the product 
of head and volume flow (volume flow rate), while the velocity of water varies with the gate opening and 
with the square root of net head.

After a unit step increase in gate opening the mechanical power goes first to −2 p.u. value and only then 
increases exponentially to the expected steady state value of 1 p.u. This is due to water inertia.
Practice has shown that this first-order model hardly suffices when the perturbation frequency 
is higher than 0.5 rad/s. The answer is to investigate the case of the elastic conduit (penstock) and 
­compressible water where the conduit of the wall stretches at the water wave front.

h is the net head
n is the turbine speed
z is the gate opening
mt is the shaft torque, all in p.u. values
As expected, the coefficients a11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23 vary with load, etc. To a first approximation a12 ≈ 
a22 ≈ 0 and, with constant aij coefficients, the first-order model is reclaimed.
Now, if the conduit is considered elastic and water as compressible, the wave equation in the conduit 
may be modeled as an electric transmission line that is open circuited at the turbine end and short-
circuited at forebay.
Finally, the incremental head and volume flow rate h(s)/q(s) transfer function of the turbine is [2]:

Figure 3.37 shows comparative results for G(s), G1(s) and G2(s) for Te = 0.25 s and Tw = 1 s.
The second-order transfer function performs quite well to and slightly beyond the first maximum 
that occurs at ω = π/2Te = 6.28 rad/s in our case (Figures 3.37 and 3.38).
It is, however, clear that well beyond this frequency a higher-order approximation is required.
Such models can be obtained with advanced curve fitting methods applied to G2(s) for the frequency 
range of interest [19,20].
The presence of a surge tank (Figure 3.39) in some hydraulic plants calls for a higher-order model.

F(s) represents now the hydraulic turbine with wave (hammer) and surge tank effects considered.
If we now add Equation 3.33 that ties the speed at turbine head and gate opening to Equations 3.57 
and 3.58, the complete nonlinear model of the hydraulic turbine with penstock and surge tank effects 
included (Figure 3.40) is obtained.
Notice that gfL and gNL are the full-load and no-load actual gate openings in p.u.
Also h0 is the normalized turbine head, U0 is the normalized water speed at turbine, UNL is the no-
load water speed at turbine, ωr is the shaft speed, Pm is the shaft power, and mt is the shaft torque dif-
ferential in p.u. values.
The nonlinear model in Figure 3.40 may be reduced to a high-order (three or more) linear model 
through various curve fittings applied to the theoretical model with given parameters. Alternatively, 
test frequency response tests may be fitted to a third-, fourth-, and even higher-order linear system for 
preferred frequency bands [21].
As the nonlinear complete model is rather involved, the question arises as of when it is to be used. 
Fortunately, only in long-term dynamic studies it is mandatory.
For governor timing studies, as the surge tank natural period (Ts) is of the order of minutes, its con-
sideration is not necessary. Further on, the hammer effect should be considered in general, but the 
second-order model suffices.
In transient stability studies, again, the hammer effect should be considered.
For small signal stability studies linearization of the turbine penstock model (second-order model) 
may be also adequate, especially in plants with long penstocks.
3.8.4  Hydraulic Turbine Governors
In principle, hydraulic turbine governors are similar to those used for steam and gas turbines. They are 
mechanohydraulic or electrohydraulic.
In general, for large power levels, they have two stages: a pilot valve servomotor and a larger power 
gate-servomotor.
An example of a rather classical good performance  system with speed control is shown in Figure 3.41.

Numbers in parenthesis are sample data [2] given only for getting a feeling of magnitudes.
A few remarks on model in Figure 3.41 are in order:
•	 The pilot valve servomotor (lower power stage of governor) may be mechanical or electric; electric 
servomotors tend to provide faster and more controllable response.
•	 Water is not very compressible, and thus the gate motion has to be gradual; near the full closure 
even slower motion is required.
•	 Dead band effects are considered in Figure 3.41, but their identification is not an easy task.
•	 Stable operation during system islanding (stand-alone operation mode of the turbine—generator 
system) and acceptable response quickness and robustness under load variations are the main 
requirements that determine the governor settings.
•	 The presence of transient compensation droop is mandatory for stable operation.
•	 For islanding operation, the choice of temporary droop RT and reset time TR is essential; they are 
related to water starting time constant TW and mechanical (inertia) time constant of the turbine/
generator set TM. Also the gain KV should be high.

106
Synchronous Generators
•)>> In hydraulic turbines where wickets gates (Figure 3.41) are also used, the governor system has to 
control their motion also, based on an optimization criterion.
The governing system thus becomes more involved. The availability of high-performance nonlin-
ear motion controllers (adaptive, variable structure, fuzzy-logic, or artificial neural networks) and of 
various powerful optimization methods [22] puts the governor system control into a new perspective 
(Figure 3.42).
Though most such advanced controllers have been tried on thermal prime movers and especially on 
power system stabilizers that usually serve only the electric generator excitation, the time for compre-
hensive digital on line control of the whole turbine generator system seems ripe [23,24].
Still, problems with safety could delay their aggressive deployment; not for a long time, though, we 
think.
3.8.5  Reversible Hydraulic Machines
Reversible hydraulic machines are in fact turbines that work part time as pumps, especially in pump-
storage hydropower plants.
Pumping may be required either for irrigation or for energy storage during off-peak electric energy 
consumption hours. It is also a safety and stability improvement vehicle in electric power systems in the 
presence of fast variations of loads over the hours of the day.
As up to 400 MW/unit pump storage hydraulic turbine pumps have been already in operation [25], 
their “industrial” deployment seems near. Pump-storage plants with synchronous (constant) speed 
­generators (motors) are a well-established technology.

A classification of turbine-pumps is in order:

•)>> Axial (Annapolis) (Figure 3.44)
)>>
b.)>> By direction of motion
•)>> With speed reversal for pumping (Figures 3.43 and 3.44)
•)>> Without speed reversal for pumping
)>>
c.)>> By direction of fluid flow/operation mode
•)>> Unidirectional/operation mode (Figure 3.43)
•)>> Bidirectional/operation mode (Figure 3.44)
There are many topological variations in existing turbine pumps; it is also feasible to design the machine 
for pumping and then check the performance for turbining, when the direction of motion is reversible.
With pumping and turbining in both directions of fluid flow, the axial turbine pump in Figure 3.43 
may be adequate for tidal-wave power plants.
The passing from turbine to pump mode implies the emptying of the turbine chamber before the 
machine is started by the electric machine as motor to prepare for pumping. This transition takes time.

Synchronous Generators
More complicated topologies are required to secure unidirectional rotation for both pumping and 
turbining, though the time to switch from turbining to pumping mode is much shorter.
In order to preserve high efficiency in pumping the speed in the pumping regime has to be larger 
than the one for turbining. In effect the head is larger and the volume flow lower in pumping. A typical 
ratio for speed would be ωp ≈ (1.12–1.18) ωT. Evidently such a condition implies adjustable speed and thus 
power electronics control on the electric machine side. Typical head/volume flow characteristics [16] for 
a radial–axial turbine/pumps are shown in Figure 3.45.
They illustrate the fact that pumping is more efficient at higher speed than turbining and at higher 
heads, in general.
Similar characteristics portray the output power versus static head for various wicket gate openings 
[25] (Figure 3.46).
Power increases with speed, and higher speeds are typical for pumping. Only wicket gate control by 
governor system is used, as adjustable speed is practiced through instantaneous power control in the 
generator rotor windings, through power electronics.

Prime Movers
The turbine governor and electric machine control schemes are rather specific for generating electric 
power (turbining) and for pumping [25].
In tidal-wave turbine/pumps, to produce electricity, a special kind of transit takes place from turbin-
ing to pumping in one direction of motion and in the other direction of motion in a single day.
The static head changes from 0% to 100% and reverses sign (Figure 3.47).
These large changes in head are expected to produce large electric power oscillations in the electric 
power delivered by the generator/motor driven by the turbine/pump. Discontinuing operation between 
pumping and turbining occurs and electric solutions based on energy storage are to be used to improve 
the quality of power delivered to the electrical power system.
3.9  Wind Turbines
Air pressure gradients along the surface of the earth produce wind whose direction and speed are highly 
variable.
Uniformity and strength of the wind are dependent on location, height above the ground, and size of 
local terrain irregularities. In general, wind air flows may be considered turbulent.
In a specific location, variation of wind speed along the cardinal directions may be shown as in 
Figure 3.48a.
This is an important information as it leads to the optimum directioning of the wind turbine, in the 
sense of extracting the largest energy from wind per year.
Wind speed increases with height and becomes more uniform. Designs with higher height/turbine 
diameter lead to more uniform flow and higher energy extraction. At the price of more expensive towers 
subjected to increased structural vibrations.
With constant energy conversion ratio, the turbine power increases approximately with cubic wind 
speed (u3) up to a design limit, umax. Above umax (Prated) the power of the turbine is kept constant by some 
turbine governor control to avoid structural or mechanical inadmissible overload (Figure 3.49).
For a given site, the wind is characterized by the so-called speed deviation (in p.u. per year). For 
example,

the maximum energy per unit speed range Emax.
In addition, the adequate speed zone for efficient energy extraction is apparent in Figure 3.50.
It should be kept in mind that these curves, or their approximations, depend heavily on location. In 
general, inland sites are characterized by large variations of speed over the day, month, while winds 
from the sea tend to have smaller variations in time.
Good extraction of energy over a rather large speed span as in Figure 3.50 implies operation of the 
wind turbine over a pertinent speed range. The electric generator has to be capable to operate at variable 
speed in such locations.
There are constant speed and variable speed wind turbines.
3.9.1  Principles and Efficiency of Wind Turbines
For centuries, wind mills have been operated in countries like Holland, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, and so 
forth. The best locations are situated either in the mountains or by the sea or by the ocean shore (or offshore).
Wind turbines are characterized by the following:
•	 Mechanical power P (W)
•	 Shaft torque (N m)
•	 Rotor speed n (rpm) or ωr (rad/s)
•	 Rated wind speed UR
•	 Tip speed ratio:

In general, Cp is a single maximum function of λ that strongly depends on the type of the turbine. 
A ­classification of wind turbines is thus in order:
•	 Axial (with horizontal shaft)
•	 Tangential (with vertical shaft)
The axial wind turbines may be slow (Figure 3.51a) and rapid (Figure 3.51b).
The shape of the rotor blades and their number are quite different for the two configurations.
The slow axial wind turbines have a good starting torque and the optimum tip speed ratio λopt ≈ 1, but 
their maximum power coefficient Cpmax(λopt) is moderate (Cpmax ≈ 0.3). In contrast, high speed axial wind 
turbines self-start at higher speed (above 5 m/s wind speed) but, for an optimum tip speed ratio λopt ≥ 7, 
they have maximum power coefficient Cpmax ≈ 0.4. That is, a higher energy conversion ratio (efficiency).
For each location, the average wind speed Uave is known. The design wind speed UR is in general 
around 1.5 Uave.
In general, the optimum tip speed ratio λopt increases as the number of rotor blades Z1 decreases:
	
(λopt, Z1) = (1, 8–24; 2, 6–12; 3, 3–6; 4, 2–4; 5, 2–3; >5, 2)	
(3.66)
Three or two blades are typical for rapid axial wind turbines.
The rotor diameter Dr, may be, to a first approximation, calculated from Equation 3.65 for rated 
(design conditions): Prated, λopt, Cpopt, UR with the turbine speed from Equation 3.64.
Tangential—vertical shaft—wind turbines have been built in quite a few configurations. They are of 
two subtypes: drag type and lift type. The axial (horizontal axis) wind turbines are all of lift subtype.
Some of the tangential wind turbine configurations are shown in Figure 3.52.

While drag subtype works at slow speeds (λopt < 1) the lift subtype works at high speeds (λopt > 1). Slow 
wind turbines have a higher self-starting torque but a lower power efficiency coefficient Cpmax.
The efficiency limit (Betz limit) may be calculated by portraying the ideal wind speed and pressure 
profile before and after the turbine (Figure 3.53).
The wind speed decreases immediately before and after the turbine disk plane while also a pressure 
differential takes place.

The maximum ideal efficiency is obtained for ∂ηi/∂Ψ = 0 at Ψopt = 2/3 (U∞/U1 = 1/3) with ηimax = 0.593.
This ideal maximum efficiency is known as the Betz limit [26].
3.9.2  Steady-State Model of Wind Turbines
The steady-state behavior of wind turbines is carried out usually through the blade element momentum 
(BEM) model. The blade is divided into a number of sections whose geometrical, mechanical, and aero-
dynamic properties are given as functions of local radius from the hub.
At the local radius the cross-sectional airfoil element of the blade is shown in Figure 3.54.
The local relative velocity Urel(r) is obtained by superimposing the axial velocity U(1 − a) and the rota-
tion velocity rωr(1 + a′) at the rotor plane.
The induced velocities (−aU and a′rωr) are produced by the vortex system of the machine.

Now, with the earlier definition of Equation 3.65, the power efficiency Cp may be calculated.
This may be done using a set of airfoil data for the given wind turbine, when a, a′, CL, and CD are 
determined first.
A family of curves Cp–λ–β is thus obtained. This in turn may be used to investigate the steady-state 
performance of the wind turbine for various wind speeds U and wind turbine speeds ωr.
As the influence of blade global pitch angle β is smaller than the influence of tip speed ratio λ in the 
power efficiency coefficient Cp, we may first keep β = ct. and vary λ for a given turbine. Typical Cp(λ) 
curves are shown on Figure 3.55 for three values of β.
For the time being let β = ct. and rewrite formula Equation 3.65 by using λ (tip speed ratio):

Adjusting turbine speed ωr, that is λ, the optimum value of λ corresponds to the case when Cp is maxi-
mum, Cpmax (Figure 3.55).
Consequently, from Equation 3.82, we obtain the following:

(3.84)
Above the maximum allowable turbine speed, obtained from mechanical or thermal constraints in 
the turbine and electric generator, the turbine speed remains constant. As expected, in turbines with 
constant speed—imposed by the generator necessity to produce constant frequency and voltage power 
output, the power efficiency constant Cp varies with wind speed (ωr = ct) and thus less-efficient wind 
energy extraction is performed (Figure 3.56).
Typical turbine power versus turbine speed curves are shown in Figure 3.57.
Variable speed operation—which needs power electronics on the generator side—produces consider-
ably more energy only if the wind speed varies considerably in time (inland sites). Not so in on or off-
shore sites, where wind speed variations are smaller.
However, the flexibility brought by variable speed in terms of electric power control of the generator 
and its power quality, with a reduction in mechanical stress in general (especially the thrust and torque 
reduction) is in favor of variable speed wind turbines.
There are two methods (Figure 3.58) to limit the power during strong winds (U > Urated):
•	 Stall control
•	 Pitch control

Stalled blades act as a “wall in the wind.” Stall occurs when the angle α between air flow and the blade 
chord is increased so much that the air flow separates from the airfoil in the suction side to limit the 
torque-producing force to its rated value.
For passive stall angle β stays constant as no mechanism to turn the blades is provided.
With a mechanism to turn the blades in place above rated wind speed Urated, to enforce stall, the angle 
β is decreased by a small amount. This is the active stall method that may be used at low speeds also to 
increase power extraction by increasing power efficiency factor Cp (Figure 3.55).
With the pitch control (Figure 3.58) the blades are turned by notably increasing the angle β. The tur-
bine turns to the position of the “flag in the wind” so that aerodynamic forces are reduced. As expected, 
the servodrive—for pitch control—to change β has to be designed for higher rating than for active stall.
3.9.3  Wind Turbine Models for Control
Besides wind slow variation with day or season time there are also under 1 Hz and over 1 Hz random 
wind speed variations (Figure 3.59) due to turbulent and wind gusts. Axial turbines (with 2,3 blades) 
experience 2,3 speed pulsations per revolution when the blades pass in front of the tower.

Sideways tower oscillations also induce shaft speed pulsations.
Mechanical transmission and (or) the elasticity of blades, blades-fixtures, couplings produce addi-
tional oscillations. The pitch-servo dynamics has to be considered also.
The wind speed spectrum of wind turbine located in the wake of a neighboring one in a wind park, 
may also change. Care must be exercised in placing the components of a wind park [29].
Finally, electric load transients or faults are producing again speed variations.
All of the above clearly indicate the intricacy of wind turbine modeling for transients and control.
3.9.3.1  Unsteady Inflow Phenomena in Wind Turbines
The BEM model is based in steady state. It presupposes that an instant change of wind profile can take 
place (Figure 3.59).
Transition from state (1) to state (2) in Figure 3.59 corresponds to an increase of global pitch angle β 
by the pitch-servo.
Experiments have shown that in reality there are at least two time constants that delay the transition: 
one related to Dr/U and the other related to 2C/(Drωr) [30].
Time lags are related to the axial/and tangential induced velocities (−aU and +a′Drωr/2).
The inclusion of a lead-lag filter to simulate the inflow phenomena seems insufficient due to consider-
able uncertainty in the modeling.
3.9.3.2  Pitch-Servo and Turbine Model
The pitch-servo is implemented as a mechanical hydraulic or electrohydraulic governor. A first-order 
(Figure 3.60) or a second-order model could be adopted.
In Figure 3.60, the pitch-servo is modeled as a simple delay Tservo, while the variation slope is limited 
between dβmin/dt to dβmax/dt (to take care of inflow phenomena). In addition, the global attack angle β 
span is limited from βoptimum to βmaximum. βopt is obtained from Cp–λ–β curve family for Cpmax with respect 
to β (Figure 3.61) [28].
Now from angle β to output power the steady-state model of the wind turbine is used (Figure 3.62) for 
a constant-speed active-stall wind turbine.

When the turbine produces more than rated power, the switch is in position a and the angle β is 
increased at the rate of 6°/s to move the blades toward the “flag-in-the-wind” position. When the power 
is around rated value, the pitch drive stays idle with β = 0, and thus β = constant (position b).
Below rated power, the switch goes to position “C” and a proportional controller (Kp) produces the 
desired β. The reference value β* corresponds to its optimum value as function of mechanical power, 
that is maximum power.
This is only a sample of the constant speed turbine model with pitch-servo control for active stall 
above rated power and βoptimization control below rated power.
As can be seen from Figure 3.62, the model is highly nonlinear. Still, the delays due to inflow phenom-
ena, elasticity of various elements of the turbine are not yet included. Also the model of the pitch-servo 
is not included. Usually, there is a transmission between the wind turbine and the electric generator. 
A six-order drive train is shown in Figure 3.63.

3.10  Summary
•	 Prime movers are mechanical machines that convert primary energy of a fuel (or fluid) into 
mechanical energy.
•	 Prime movers drive electric generators connected to the power grid or operating in isolation.
•	 Steam and gas turbines and internal combustion engines (spark-ignited or diesel) are burning 
fossil fuels to produce mechanical work.
•	 Steam turbines contain stationary and rotating blades grouped into (HP, IP, and LP sections on 
same shaft in tandem-compound and on two shafts in cross-compound configurations.
•	 Between stages, steam engines use reheaters; single reheat and double reheat, at most.
•	 Typically in steam turbines, the power is divided as 30% in the HP, 40% in the IP and 30% in the 
LP stage.
•	 Governor valves and IV are used to control the HP and, respectively, LP stages of the steam flow.
•	 The steam vessel may be modeled by a first-order delay, while the steam turbine torque is propor-
tional to its steam flow rate.
•	 Three more delays related to inlet and steam chest, to the reheater and to the crossover piping may 
be identified.

•)>> Speed governor for steam turbines include a speed relay with a first-order delay and a hydraulic 
servomotor characterized by a further delay.
•)>> Gas turbines burn natural gas in combination with air that is compressed in a compressor driven 
by the gas turbine itself.
•)>> The 500°C gas exhaust is used to produce steam that drives a steam turbine placed on the same 
shaft. These combined cycle unishaft gas turbines are credited with a total efficiency above 55%. 
Combined cycle gas turbines at large powers seem the way of the future. They are also introduced 
for cogeneration in high-speed small- and medium-power applications.
•)>> Diesel engines are used from the kilowatt range to megawatt range power per unit for cogenera-
tion or for standby (emergency) power sets.
•)>> The fuel injection control in diesel engines is performed by a speed-governing system.
•)>> The diesel engine model contains a nonconstant gain. The gain depends on the eer, which in turn 
is governed by the fuel/air ratio; a dead time constant dependent on engine speed is added to 
complete the diesel engine model.
•)>> Diesel engines are provided with a turbocharger that has a turbine “driven” by the fuel exhaust 
that drives a compressor that provides the hot HP air for the air mix of the main engine. The tur-
bocharger runs freely at high speed but is coupled to the engine at low speed.
•)>> Stirling engines are “old” thermal piston engines with continuous heat supply. Their thermal 
cycles contains two isotherms. It contains, in a basic configuration, two opposed pistons and a 
regenerator in between. The efficiency of Stirling engine is temperature limited.
•)>> Stirling engines are independent fuel type; use air, methane, He, or H2 as working fluids. They did 
not reach commercial success in kinetic type due to problems with the regenerator and stabilization.
•)>> Stirling engines with free piston-displacer mover and linear motion have reached recently the 
markets in units in the 50 W to a few kilowatts.
•)>> The main merits of Stirling engines are related to their quietness and reduced noxious emissions, 
but they tend to be expensive and difficult to stabilize.
•)>> Hydraulic turbines convert water energy of rivers into mechanical work. They are the oldest 
prime movers.
•)>> Hydraulic turbines are of impulse type for heads above 300–400 m and of reaction type (below 
300 m). In a more detailed classification, they are tangential (Pelton), radial–axial (Francis) and 
axial (Kaplan, Bulb, Straflo).
•)>> High head (impulse) turbines use a nozzle with a needle-controller where water is accelerated and 
then it impacts the bowl-shaped buckets on the water wheel of the turbine. A jet deflector deflects 
water from runner to limit turbine speed when electric load decreases.
•)>> Reaction turbines—at medium and low head—use wicket gates and rotor blade servomotors to 
control water flow in the turbine.
•)>> Hydraulic turbines may be modeled by a first-order model if water hammer (wave) and surge 
effects are neglected. Such a rough approximation does not hold above 0.1 Hz.
•)>> Second-order models for hydraulic turbines with water hammer effect in the penstock considered 
are valid up to 1 Hz. Higher orders are required above 1 Hz as the nonlinear model has a gain 
whose amplitude varies periodically. Second- or third-order models may be identified from tests 
through adequate curve fitting methods.
•)>> Hydraulic turbine governors have one or two power levels. The lower power level may be electric, 
while the larger (upper) power level is a hydraulic servomotor. The speed controller of the gover-
nor has traditionally a permanent droop and a transient droop.
•)>> Modern nonlinear control systems may now be used to control simultaneously the guide vane 
runner and the blade runner.
•)>> Reversible hydraulic machines are used for pump storage power plants or for tidal-wave power 
plants. The optimal pumping speed is about 12%–20% above the optimal turbining speed. Variable 
speed operation is required. Therefore, power electronics on the electric side is mandatory.

123

•)>> Wind turbines use the wind air energy. Nonuniformity and strength vary with location height 
and terrain irregularities. Wind speed duration versus speed, speed versus frequency and mean 
(average) speed using Raleigh or Weibull distribution are used to characterize wind on a location 
in time. The wind turbine rated wind speed is, in general, 150% of mean wind speed.
•)>> Wind turbines are of two main types: axial (with horizontal shaft) and tangential (with vertical 
shaft).
•)>> Wind turbines’ main steady-state parameter is the power efficiency coefficient Cp, which is depen-
dent on blade tip speed Rωr to wind speed U (ratio λ). Cp depends on λ and on blade absolute attack 
angle β.
•)>> The maximum Cp (0.3–0.4) with respect to β is obtained for λopt ≤ 1 for low-speed axial turbines 
and for λopt ≥ 1 for high-speed turbines.
•)>> The ideal maximum efficiency limit of wind turbines is about 0.6 (Betz limit).
•)>> Wind impacts on the turbine a thrust force and a torque. Only torque is useful. The thrust force 
and Cp depend on blade absolute attack angle β.
•)>> The optimal power PT (λopt) is proportional to u3 (u—wind speed).
•)>> Variable speed turbines will collect notably more power from a location if the speed varies sig-
nificantly with time and season, such that λ may be kept optimum. Above rated wind speed (and 
power), the power is limited by passive stall, active stall, or pitch-servo control.
•)>> Wind turbine steady-state models are highly nonlinear. Unsteady inflow phenomena show up in 
fast transients and have to be accounted for by more than lead-lag elements.
•)>> Pitch-servo control is becoming more and more frequent even with variable speed operation, to 
allow speed limitation during load transients or power grid faults.

Large- and Medium-Power Synchronous 
Generators: Topologies and Steady State
4.1  Introduction
By large powers, we mean powers above 1 MW per unit, where in general the rotor magnetic field is 
­produced with electromagnetic excitation. There are a few megawatt power permanent magnet (PM)-
rotor synchronous generators (SGs), but they will be treated in a dedicated chapter, in Part 2 of EGH: 
variable speed generators.
Almost all electric energy generation is performed through SGs with power per unit up to 2000 MVA 
in thermal power plants and up to 700 MW (1000 MW in R&D) per unit in hydropower plants. SGs in 
the megawatt and tenth of megawatt range are used in diesel engine power groups for cogeneration or 
on locomotives and on ships.
We will start with a description of basic configurations, their main components, and principles of 
operation and then describe the steady-state operation in some detail.
4.2  Construction Elements
The basic parts of an SG are the stator, rotor, the framing (with cooling system), and the excitation 
system.
The stator is provided with a magnetic core made of silicon steel sheets (0.55 mm thick in general) in 
which uniform slots are stamped. A single, standard, magnetic sheet steel is produced up to 1 m diameter as 
a complete circle (Figure 4.1). Large turbo generators and most hydrogenerators have stator outer diameters 
well in excess of 1 m (up to 18 m), and thus the cores are made of 6–42 segments per circle (Figure 4.2).
The stator may also be split radially into two or more sections to allow handling and permit trans-
port with windings in slots. The windings are inserted in slots section by section, and their connection 
together is performed at the power plant site.
When the stator with Ns slots is divided and the number of slot pitches per segment is mp, the number 
of segments ms is such that:
	
N
m m
s
s
p
=
×
	
(4.1)
Each segment is attached to the frame through two keybars or dovetail wedges that are uniformly 
­distributed along the periphery (Figure 4.2).
In two successive layers (laminations), the segments are offset by half a segment.
The distance between wedges b is

(4.2)

Synchronous Generators
This is so to allow for offsetting the segments in subsequent layers by half a segment. Also, only one tool 
for stamping is required because all segments are identical. To avoid winding damage due to vibration, 
each segment should start and end in the middle of a tooth and span over an even number of slot pitches.
For the divided stator into S sectors, two types of segments are generally used. One type with mp slot 
pitches and the other with np slot pitches such that

(4.3)
With np = 0, the first case is obtained and, in fact, the number of segments per stator sector is an integer. 
This is not always possible and thus two types of segments are required.
The offset of segments in subsequent layers is mp/2 if mp is even, (mp ± 1)/2 for mp odd, and mp/3 if mp 
is divisible by 3. In the particular case that np = mp/2, we may just cut the main segment in two to obtain 
the second one, and thus again only one stamping tool is required. For more details, see Reference [1].
The slots of large- and medium-power SGs are rectangular and open (Figure 4.3).
The double layer winding, made usually of magnetic wires with rectangular cross-section, is “kept” 
inside the open slot by a wedge made of insulator material or from a magnetic material with a low 
equivalent tangential permeability that is μr times larger than that of air. The magnetic wedge may be 
made of magnetic powders or of laminations, with a rectangular prolonged hole (Figure 4.3b), “glued 
together” with a thermally and mechanically resilient resin.

4.2.1  Stator Windings
The stator slots are provided with coils connected to form a three-phase winding.
The winding of each phase produces an air gap fixed magnetic field with 2p1 half-periods per revolu-
tion. With Dis as the internal stator diameter, the pole pitch τ—that is, the half period of winding mmf, is

(4.5)
The number q may be integer—with low number of poles (2p < 8–10)—or it may be a fractionary number:
	
q = a + b/c	
(4.6)
Fractionary q windings are used mainly in SGs with a large number of poles, where a necessarily low 
integer q (q ≤ 3) would produce too a high harmonics content in the generator electromagnetic force 
(emf).
Large- and medium-power SGs make use of typical lap (multiturn coil) windings (Figure 4.4) or of 
bar-wave (single-turn coil) windings (Figure 4.5).
The coils of phase A in Figures 4.4 and 4.5 are all in series. A single current path is thus available (a = 1). It 
is feasible to have “a” current paths in parallel, especially in large-power machines (line voltage is in general 
below 24 kV). With Wph turns in series (per current path), we do have the relationship:

The coils may be multiturn lap coils, in general, or uniturn (bar) type—in wave coils.
A general comparison between the two types of windings (both with integer and fractionary q) 
reveals the following:
•)>> The multiturn coils (nc > 1) allow for greater flexibility in choosing the number of slots Ns, for 
given number of current paths a.
•)>> Multiturn coils are however manufacturing-wise limited to 0.3 m long lamination stacks and pole 
pitches τ < 0.8–1 m.
•)>> Multiturn coils need bending as they are placed with one side in the bottom layer and with the 
other one in the top layer; bending needs to be done without damaging the electric insulation, 
which, in turn, has to be flexible enough for the intended purpose.
•)>> Bar coils are used for heavy currents (above 1500 A). Wave bar coils imply a smaller number of 
connectors (Figure 4.5) and thus are less costly. The lap-bar coils allow for short-pitching—to 
reduce emf harmonics, while wave bar coils imply 100% average pitch coils.
•)>> To avoid excessive eddy current (skin) effects in deep coil sides, transposition of individual strands 
is required. In multiturn coils (nc ≥ 2), one semi-Roebel transposition is enough, while in single-
bar coils full Roebel transposition is required.
•)>> Switching or lightning strokes along the transmission lines to SG produce steep-fronted volt-
age impulses between neighboring turns in the multiturn coil and thus additional insulation is 
required. Not so for the bar (single turn) coils where only interlayer and slot insulation is provided.
•)>> Accidental short circuit in multiturn coil windings with a ≥ 2 current path in parallel produces a cir-
culating current between current paths. This unbalance in current paths may be sufficient to trip off 
the pertinent circuit balance relay. Not so far the bar coils where the unbalance is less pronounced.
•)>> Though slightly more expensive, the technical advantages of bar (single-turn) coils should make 
them the favorite solution in most cases.
AC windings for SGs may be built not only in two layers but also in one layer. In the latter case, there is a 
necessity to use 100% pitch coils that have longer end connections, unless bar coils are used.

Large- and Medium-Power Synchronous Generators
Stator end-windings have to be mechanically supported to avoid mechanical deformation during 
severe transients due to electrodynamic large forces between them and between them as a whole and 
the rotor excitation end-windings. As in general such forces are radial, the support for end-windings 
typically looks as in Figure 4.6.
Note: More on AC winding specifics in the chapter dedicated on SG design. Here we only derive the 
fundamental magneto-motive-force, mmf, wave of three-phase stator windings.
The mmf of a single-phase 4 pole winding with 100% pitch coils may be approximated with a step-like 
periodic function if the slot openings are neglected (Figure 4.7).
For the case in Figure 4.7. with q = 2 and 100% pitch coils, the mmf distribution is rectangular with 
only one step per half-period.
With chorded coils or q > 2, more steps would be visible in the mmf. That is, the distribution approxi-
mates then better a sinusoid waveform.
In general, the phase mmf fundamental distribution for steady state may be written as follows:

Large- and Medium-Power Synchronous Generators
For ν = 1, the fundamental is obtained.
Due to full symmetry—with q integer—only odd harmonics exist. For ν = 1, KBI = 1, KBII = 0, therefore 
the mmf fundamental represents a forward-traveling wave with the peripheral linear speed:
	
dx

(4.15)
The harmonic orders are ν = 3K ± 1. For ν = 7, 13, 19,…, dx/dt = 2τf1/ν and for ν = 5, 11, 17,…, dx/dt = 
−2τf1/ν. That is, the first ones are direct traveling waves, while the second ones are backward-traveling 
waves. Coil chording (y/τ < 1) and increased q may reduce harmonics amplitude (reduced Kwν), but the 
price is a reduction in the mmf fundamental too (KW1 decreases).
The rotor of large SGs may be built with salient poles (for 2p1 > 4) or with nonsalient poles (2p1 = 2, 4).
The solid iron core of the nonsalient pole rotor is made of 12–20 cm thick (axially) rolled steel 
discs spigoted to each other to form a solid ring by using axial through bolts. Shaft ends are added 
(Figure 4.8).
Salient poles (Figure 4.9b) may be made of laminations packs tightened axially by through bolts and 
end plates and fixed to the rotor pole wheel by hammer-tail key bars.
In general, peripheral speeds around 110 m/s are feasible only with solid rotors made by forged 
steel. The field coils in slots (Figure 4.9) are protected from centrifugal forces by slot wedges that 
are made either of strong resins or of conducting material (copper), and the end-windings need 
bandages.
The interpole area in salient pole rotors (Figure 4.9b) is used to mechanically fix the field coil sides so 
that they do not move or vibrate, while the rotor rotates at its maximum allowable speed.
Nonsalient poles (high-speed) rotors show small magnetic anisotropy. That is, the magnetic reluc-
tance of air gap along pole (longitudinal) axis d, and along interpole (transverse) axis q, is about the 
same, except for the case of severe magnetic saturation conditions.
In contrast, salient pole rotor experience a rather large (1.5–1 and more) magnetic saliency ratio 
between axis d and axis q. The damper cage bars placed in special rotor poles slots may be connected 
together through end rings (Figure 4.10a). Such a complete damper cage may be decomposed in two 
fictitious cages, one with the magnetic axis along d axis and the other along q axis (Figure 4.10), both 
with partial end rings (Figure 4.10).

4.3  Excitation Magnetic Field
The air gap magnetic field produced by the DC field (excitation) coils has a circumferential distribution 
that depends on the type of the rotor—with salient or nonsalient poles—and on the air gap variation 
along rotor pole span. For now let us consider that the air gap is constant under the rotor pole and the 
presence of stator slot openings is considered through the Carter coefficient KC1 which increases the air 
gap [2]:

Only the fundamental is useful. Both the fundamental distribution (ν = 1) and the space harmonics 
depend on the ratio τp/τ (pole span/pole pitch). In general, τp/τ ≈ 0.6–0.72. Also, to reduce the har-
monics content, the air gap may be modified (increased), from the pole middle toward pole ends, as an 
inverse function of cos πx/τ:

In practice, function of Equation 4.21 is not easy to generate, but approximations of it, easy to manufac-

Reducing the no-load air gap flux density harmonics causes a reduction of time harmonics in the 
­stator emf (or no-load stator phase voltage).

It is obvious that in this case, the flux density harmonics are lower and thus constant air gap (cylindrical 
rotor) is feasible in all practical cases.

Therefore, we notice that the excitation coil currents in the rotor are producing at no-load (open-stator 
phases) three symmetric emfs whose frequency ωr is given by the rotor speed Ωr = ωr/p1.

4.4  Two-Reaction Principle of Synchronous Generators
Let us now suppose that an excited SG is driven on no load at speed ωr. When a balanced three-
phase load is connected to the stator, the presence of emfs at frequency ωr will naturally produce 
currents of same frequency. The phase shift between the emfs and the phase current ψ is depen-
dent on load nature (power factor) and on machine parameters—not mentioned yet (Figure 4.13).
The sinusoidal emfs and currents are represented as simple phasors in Figure 4.13b.
The magnetic anisotropy of the rotor along axes d and q helps decompose each phase ­current in two 
components: one in phase with the emf and the other at 90° with respect to the ­former: IAq, IBq, and ICq, 
and IAd, IBd, and ICd, respectively.
As already proven in the paragraph on windings, three-phase symmetric windings flowed by bal-
anced currents of frequency ωr will produce traveling mmfs Equation 4.13:

In essence, the d-axis stator currents produce an mmf aligned to the excitation air gap flux density 
wave of Equation 4.26 but opposite in sign (for the situation in Figure 4.13b). This means that the 
d-axis mmf component produces a magnetic field “fixed” to the rotor and flowing along axis d as the 
excitation field does.

In contrast, the q-axis stator current components produces an mmf whose magnetic field is again 
“fixed” the rotor but flowing along axis q.
The emfs produced by motion in the stator windings might be viewed as produced by a fictitious

The reactive power may be either positive (delivered) or negative (drawn) both for motor and generator 
operation.
For reactive power “production,” Id should be opposite to IF, that is, the longitudinal armature reac-
tion air gap field will oppose the excitation air gap field. It is said that only with demagnetizing longitu-
dinal armature reaction—machine overexcitation—the generator (motor) can “produce” reactive power. 
Therefore, for constant active power load, the reactive power “produced” by the synchronous machine 
may be increased by increasing the field current IF. On the contrary, with underexcitation, the reactive 
power becomes negative; it is “absorbed.” This extraordinary feature of the synchronous machine makes 
it suitable for voltage control, in power systems, through reactive power control via IF control. On the 
other hand, the frequency ωr, tied to speed, Ωr = ωr/p1, is controlled through the prime mover governor, 
as discussed in Chapter 3. For constant frequency power output, speed has to be constant.
This is so because the two traveling fields—that of excitation and respectively that of armature wind-
ings—interact to produce constant (non-zero-average) electromagnetic torque only at standstill with 
each other.
This is expressed in Equation 4.40 by the condition that the frequency of E1 − ωr—be equal to fre-
quency of stator current I1 − ω1 = ωr—to produce nonzero active power.
In fact, Equation 4.40 is valid only when ωr = ω1, but in essence the average instantaneous electromag-
netic power is nonzero only in such conditions.
4.5  Armature Reaction Field and Synchronous Reactances
As during steady state, rotor (excitation) and stator (armature) produced magnetic field waves in the air 
gap are relatively at standstill, it follows that the stator currents do not induce voltages (currents) in the 
field coils on the rotor. The armature reaction—stator—field wave travels at rotor speed; the longitudinal 
IaA, IaB, IaC and transverse IqA, IqB, IqC armature currents (reaction) fields are fixed to the rotor, one along 
axis d and the other along axis q.
Thus, for these currents, the machine reacts with the magnetization reluctances of the air gap and of 
stator and rotor iron with no rotor-induced currents.
The trajectory of armature reaction d, q fields, and their distributions are shown in Figures 4.15 
and 4.16.
The armature reaction mmfs Fd1 and Fq1 have a sinusoidal space distribution (only fundamental is 
considered), but their air gap flux densities does not have a sinusoidal space distribution. For constant 
air gap zones—such as it is that under the constant air gap salient pole rotors—the air gap flux density is 
sinusoidal. In the interpole zone of salient pole machine, the equivalent air gap is large and thus the flux 
density decreases quickly (Figures 4.15 and 4.16).
Only with the finite-element method (FEM) can the correct flux density distribution of armature (or 
excitation, or combined) mmfs be computed. For the time being, let us consider that, for the d axis mmf, 
the interpolar air gap is infinite and for the q axis mmf it is gq = 6g. In axis q, the transverse armature 
mmf is maximum, and it is not practical to consider that the air gap in that zone is infinite as it would 
lead to large errors. Not so for d axis mmf, which is small toward axis q and thus the infinite air gap 
approximation is tolerable.

139
Large- and Medium-Power Synchronous Generators
 It should be noted that the q-axis armature reaction field is far from a sinusoid. This is so only for 
salient pole rotor SGs. For steady-state, we however operate only with fundamentals, and with respect 
to them we define the reactances, etc.
Therefore, we now extract the fundamentals of Bad and Baq to find the Bad1 and Baq1:

Equation 4.44 and 4.46 warrant the following remarks:
•	 The fundamental armature reaction flux density in axes d and q are proportional to the respective 
stator mmfs and are inversely proportional to air gap and magnetic saturation equivalent factors 
Ksd and Ksq (Ksd ≠ Ksq in general).
•	 Bad1 and Baq1 are also proportional to equivalent armature reaction coefficients Kd1 and Kq1. Both 
being smaller than unity (Kd1 < 1, Kq1 < 1) account for air gap nonuniformity (slotting is considered 
only by Carter coefficient). Other than that Bad1 and Baq1 formulae are very similar to the air gap 
flux density fundamental Ba1 in a uniform air gap machine with same stator, Ba1:

Ksd = Ksq = Ks was implied.
The term “cyclic” comes from the fact that these reactances manifest themselves only with balanced 
stator currents and symmetric windings and only for steady state.
During steady state with balanced load, the stator currents manifest themselves by two distinct mag-
netization reactances, one for axis d and the other for axis q, acted upon by the d and q phase current 
components. We should add to these the leakage reactance typical to any winding, X1l, to compose the 
so-called ­synchronous reactances of the synchronous machine (Xd and Xq):

The damper cage currents are zero during steady state with balanced load, as the armature reaction field 
fundamental components are at standstill with the rotor and have constant amplitudes (due to constant 
stator current amplitude).
We are thus ready to proceed with SG equations for steady state under balanced load.
4.6  Equations for Steady State with Balanced Load
We already introduced stator fictitious AC three-phase field currents IF,A,B,C to emulate the field winding 
motion-produced emfs in the stator phases EA,B,C.
The decomposition of each stator phase currents IqA,B,C, IdA,B,CI, which then produces the armature 
reaction field waves at standstill with respect to excitation field wave, has lead to the definition of cyclic 
synchronous reactances Xd and Xq. Consequently, as our fictitious machine is under steady state with 
zero rotor currents, the per-phase equations in complex (phasors) are simply as follows:
	
I1R1 + V1 = E1 − jXdId − jXqIq
	
E = −jXFm × IF; XFm = ωrMFA	
(4.54)
	
I1 = Id + Iq	
(4.55)
RMS values all over in Equations 4.54 and 4.55.
To secure the correct phasing of currents, let us consider IF along axis d (real). Then, according to

With IF > 0, Id is positive for underexcitation (E1 < V1) and negative for overexcitation (E1 > V1). Also, Iq in 
Equation 4.56 is positive for generating and negative for motoring.

As can be seen from Equations 4.60 and 4.61, the active power is positive (generating) only with Iq > 0. 
Also with Xdm ≥ Xqm, the anisotropy active power is positive (generating) only with positive Id (mag-
netization armature reaction along axis d). But positive Id in Equation 4.61 means definitely negative 
(absorbed) reactive power and the SG is underexcited.
In general, Xdm/Xqm = (1.0−1.7) for most SGs with electromagnetic excitation. Consequently, the 
anisotropy electromagnetic power is notably smaller than the interaction electromagnetic power. In 
nonsalient pole machines Xdm ≈ (1.01−1.05)Xqm due to the presence of rotor slots in axis q that increase 
the equivalent air gap (KC increases due to double slotting). Also, when the SG saturates (magnetically) 
the level of saturation under load may be in some regimes larger than in axis d. In other regimes when 
magnetic saturation is larger in axis d, nonsalient pole rotor may have a slight inverse magnetic saliency 
(Xdm < Xqm). As only the stator winding losses have been considered (

As expected, from Equation 4.63, the electromagnetic torque does not depend on frequency (speed) ωr, 
but only on field current and stator current components, besides the machine inductances: the mutual 
one, MFA, and magnetization ones Ldm and Lqm. The currents IF, Id, Iq influence the level of magnetic satu-
ration in stator and rotor cores and thus MFA, Ldm and Lqm are functions of all of them.
Magnetic saturation is an involved phenomenon to be treated in Chapter 5.
The shaft torque Ta differs from electromagnetic torque Te by the mechanical power loss (pmec) braking

where Et is total flux phase emf in the SG. Now two phasor diagrams, one suggested by Equation 4.54 
and other by Equation 4.70 are presented in Figure 4.17a and b.
The time phase angle δV between the emf E1 and the phase voltage V1 is traditionally called the internal 
(power) angle of the SG.
As we have written Equations 4.54 and 4.70 for the generator association of signs, δV > 0 for generat-
ing (Iq > 0) and δV < 0 for motoring (Iq < 0).
For large SGs, even the stator resistance may be neglected for more clarity in the phasor diagrams but 
at the cost of “loosing” the copper loss consideration.

4.8  Inclusion of Core Losses in the Steady-State Model
The core loss due to the fundamental component of magnetic field wave produced together by both exci-
tation and armature mmf occurs only in the stator. This is so because the two fundamental field waves 
travel at rotor speed. We may consider, to a first approximation, that the core losses are related directly 
to the main (air gap) magnetic flux linkage Ψ1m:

The leakage flux linkage components LslId and LslIq do not produce significant core losses as Lsl/Ldm < 0.15 
in general and most of the leakage flux lines flow within air zones (slot, end-windings, air gap).
Now, we may consider a three-phase stator fictitious short circuited resistive-only winding—RFe—
which accounts for the core loss.
Neglecting the reaction field of core loss currents IFe, we have

Though core losses are small in large SGs, and thus they do not change the phasor diagram notably,

I1r = 3000 A, R1 = 0.0125 Ω, (ηr)cos φ1 = 1 = 0.9926, pFen = pmecn. Additional data include stator 
interior diameter Dis = 13 m, stator active stack length lstack = 1.4 m, constant air gap under 
the poles g = 0.020 m, Carter coefficient KC = 1.15, τp/τ = 0.72. The equivalent unique satura-
tion factor Ks = 0.2.
The number of turns in series per phase is W1 = p1q1 × 1 turn/coil = 45 × 3 × 1 = 115 turns/phase.
Let us calculate the following:
	
a.	 The stator winding factor KW1;
	
b.	 The d–q magnetization reactances Xdm, Xqm;
	
c.	 With X1l = 0.2Xdm, determine Xd, Xq;
	
d.	 Rated core and mechanical losses PFen = pmecn;
	
e.	 xd, xq, r1 in P.U. with Zn = V1ph/I1r
	
f.	 Neglecting all losses at cos φ1 = 1 and δv = 30° calculate E1, Id, Iq, I1, E1, P1, Q1
	
g.	 The no load air gap flux density (Ks = 0.2) and the corresponding rotor-pole mmf WFIF

Note that the large air gap (g = 2 × 10−2 m) justifies the rather moderate saturation (iron reluc-
tance) factor KS = 0.2.
The field-winding losses have not been considered in the efficiency as they are covered from 
a separate power source.
4.9  Autonomous Operation of Synchronous Generators
Autonomous operation of SGs is required by numerous applications. Also, some SG characteristics in 
autonomous operation, obtained through special tests or by computation, may be used to characterize 
the SG rather comprehensively.
Typical characteristics at constant speed are as follows [4]
	
a.	 No-load saturation curve E1(IF)
	
b.	 Short-circuit saturation curve: I1sc(IF) for V1 = 0 and cos φ1 = ct
	
c.	 Zero power factor saturation curve: V1(I1); IF = ct cos φ1 = ct
These curves may be computed or obtained from standard tests.
4.9.1  No-Load Saturation Curve: E1(IF); n = ct, I1 = 0
At zero load (stator) current, the excited machine is driven at the speed n1 = f1/p1 by a smaller power 
rating motor. The stator no-load voltage, in fact the emf (per phase or line) E1, and the field current are 
measured. The field current is monotonously raised from zero to a positive value IFmax corresponding 
to 120%–150% of rated voltage V1r at rated frequency f1r (n1r = f1r/p1). The experimental arrangement is 
shown in Figure 4.19.
At zero field current, the remnant magnetization of rotor poles iron produces a small emf E1r (2%–8% 
of V1r), and thus the experiments start at point A or A′. The field current is then increased in small

increments until the no-load voltage E1 reaches 120%–150% of rated voltage (point B, along the trajec-
tory AMB). Then the field current is decreased steadily to zero in very small steps and the characteristic 
evolves along BNA′ trajectory. It may be that the starting point is A′, and this is confirmed when IF 
increases from zero and the emf decreases first and then increases. In the latter case, the characteristic 
travels along the way A′NBMA. The hysteresis phenomenon in the stator and the rotor cores is the cause 
for the difference between the rising and falling sides of the curve. The average curve represents the no-
load saturation curve.
The increase in emf well above rated voltage is required to check the required field current for the 
lowest design power factor at full load (IFmax/IF0). This ratio is, in general, IFmax/IF0 = 1.8–3.5. The lower the 
lowest power factor at full-load and rated voltage, the larger the ratio IFmax/IF0. The ratio also varies with 
the air gap-to-pole pitch ratio (g/τ) and with the number of poles pairs p1. It is important to know the 
corresponding IFmax/IF0 ratio for a proper thermal design of the SG.
The no-load saturation curve may also be computed: either analytically or through FEM. As FEM 
analysis will be dealt with later, here we dwell on the analytical approach. To do so, we draw two typical 
flux line pairs corresponding to the no-load operation of SG (Figure 4.20).
There are two basic analytical approaches of practical interest. Let us call them here the flux-line 
method and, respectively, the multiple magnetic circuit method.
The rather simplified flux-line method considers the Ampere’s law along a basic flux line and applies 
the flux conservation in the rotor yoke, rotor pole body and rotor pole shoe and, respectively, in the 
­stator teeth and yoke.
The magnetic saturation in these regions is considered through a unique (average) flux density and 
also an average flux-line length. It is thus an approximate method as the level of magnetic saturation 
varies tangentially along rotor-pole body, shoe, in the salient rotor pole and, respectively, in the rotor 
teeth of the nonsalient pole.
The leakage flux lost between the salient rotor pole bodies and their shoes is also very approximately 
considered.
However, if a certain average air gap flux density value BgFm is assigned for start, the rotor pole mmf 
WFIF required to produce it, accounting for magnetic saturation, though approximately, may be com-
puted without any iteration. If the air gap under the rotor salient poles increases from center to pole ends

(to produce a more sinusoidal air gap flux density), an average value again is to be considered to simplify 
the computation. Once the BgFm(IF) curve is calculated, the E1(IF) curve is straightforward (based on

The analytical flux-line method is illustrated here through a case study (Example 4.2).
Example 4.2
A three-phase salient pole rotor SG with Sn = 50 MVA, Vl = 10,500 V, n1 = 428 rpm, f1 = 50 Hz has 
the following geometrical data: internal stator diameter Dr = 3.85 m, 2p1 = 14 poles, lstack ≈ 1.39 m, 
pole pitch τ = πDr/2p1 = 0.864 m, air gap g (constant) = 0.021 m, q1 = 6 slots/pole/phase, open sta-
tor slots with hs = 0.130 m (total slot height, with 0.006 m reserved for the wedge); Ws = 0.020 m 
(slot width), stator yoke hys = 0.24 m, and rotor geometry is as in Figure 4.21.
Let us consider only the rated flux density condition, with BgFm1 = 0.850 T. The stator lamina-
tion magnetization curve is given in Table 4.1.
The Ampere’s law along the contour ABCDC′B′A′ relates the mmf drop from rotor-to-rotor

For the case in point, the main contribution is placed in the rotor pole. This is natural as the pole body 
width bpr has to leave room to place the field windings. Therefore, in general, bpr is around τ/3, at most. 
The above routine illustrates the computational procedure for one point of the no load magnetization 
curve BgFm1(IF). Other points may be calculated is a similar way. A more precise solution, at the price of 
larger computation time, may be obtained through the multiple magnetic circuit method [5], but real 
precision results require FEM as shown in Chapter 5.
4.9.2  Short-Circuit Saturation Curve I1 = f(IF); V1 = 0, n1 = nr = ct
The short-circuit saturation curve is obtained by driving the excited SG at rated speed nr with short-
circuited stator terminals. The field DC current IF is varied downward gradually and both IF and stator 
current Isc are measured. In general, measurements for 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of rated current is 
necessary to reduce the winding temperature during that test. The results are plotted on Figure 4.23b.
From the voltage equation (Equation 4.54) with V1 = 0 and I1 = I3sc, one obtains

Again for pure reactive load and zero losses, the electromagnetic torque is zero; and so is Iq.
An underexcited synchronous machine acting as a motor on no load is, in general, used to represent 
the reactive load for the SG under zero power factor operation with constant stator current Id.
The field current of the SG is reduced simultaneously with the increase in field current of the 
­underexcited no-load synchronous motor (SM), to keep the stator current Id constant (at rated value), 
while the terminal voltage decreases. This way V1(IF) for constant Id is obtained (Figure 4.25).
The abscissa of the short-circuit triangle OCA is moved at the level of rated voltage, then a parallel 
0B′ to 0B is drawn that intersects the no-load curve at B′. The vertical segment 0B′ is defined as follows:
	
X I
B C
p 1 = ¢
	
(4.91)
Though we started with the short-circuit triangle in our geometrical construction BC < B′C because 
magnetic saturation conditions are different. Therefore, in fact, Xp (Potier’s reactance)> X1l, in general, 
especially in salient pole rotor SG.
The main practical purpose of zero power factor saturation curve today would be to determine the 
leakage reactance and for temperature tests. One way to reduce the value of Xp and thus fall closer to 
X1l is to raise the terminal voltage above rated one in the V1(IF) curve and thus obtain the triangle ACB″ 
whose CB″ ≈ X1lI1. It is claimed, however, that (115%–120%) voltage is required, which might not be 
allowed by some manufacturers. Alternative methods to measure the stator leakage reactance X1l are 
to be presented in Chapter 8. The zero-power factor load testing may be used for temperature on load 
estimation without requiring active power full load.

4.9.4  V1–I1 Characteristic, IF = ct, cos φ1 = ct, n1 = nr
The V1–I1 characteristic refers to terminal voltage versus load current I1, for balanced load at constant 
field current, load power factor and speed.
Obtaining the V1−I1 curve needs full real load, therefore in fact it is feasible either only on small 
and medium power autonomous SGs at manufacturer’s site or the testing may be performed after the 
­commissioning at user’s site.
The voltage equation, phasor diagram, and the no-load saturation curve should provide information 
such that, with magnetic saturation coarsely accounted for, to calculate V1(I1) for given load impedance 
per phase ZL(ZL, φ1) (Figure 4.26).

(φ1 < 0).

Autonomous SGs are designed to provide operation at rated load current and rated voltage and a mini-

The air gap in SGs for autonomous operation has to be large to secure such a condition. Consequently, 
notable field current mmf is required. And thus the power loss in the field winding increases. This is 
one reason to consider permanent magnet rotor SGs for autonomous operation for low-medium power 
units; though full power electronics is needed.
Note that for calculations with errors below 1%–2%, when using Equation 4.93, careful consideration 
of magnetic saturation level that depends simultaneously on IF, Id, Iq must be observed. This subject will 
be treated in more detail in Chapter 5.
4.10  SG Operation at Power Grid (in Parallel)
SGs in parallel constitute the basis of a regional, national, or continental electric power system (grid). 
SGs have to connected to the power grid one by one.
For the time being, we suppose that the power grid is of infinite power, that is, of fixed-voltage ampli-
tude, frequency, and phase.

161
Large- and Medium-Power Synchronous Generators
In order to connect the SGs to the power grid without large current and power transients, the 
amplitude, frequency, sequence, and phase of the SG no-load voltages have to coincide with the same 
parameters of the power grid. As the power switch does not react instantaneously, some transients 
will always occur. However, they have to be limited. Automatic synchronization of the SG to the 
power grid is today performed through coordinated speed (frequency and phase) and field current 
control (Figure 4.27).
The active power transients during the connection to the power grid may be positive (generating) or 
negative (motoring) (see Figure 4.26).
4.10.1  Power/Angle Characteristic: Pe (δV)
The power (internal) angle δV is the angle between the terminal voltage V1 and the field current 
produced emf E1. This angle may be calculated both for the autonomous and for the power-grid-
connected generator. Traditionally, the power/angle characteristic is calculated and widely used for 
power-grid-connected generators mainly because of stability computation opportunities. For a large 
power grid, the voltage phasors in the phasor diagram are fixed in amplitude and phase. For more 
clarity, we neglect here the losses in the SG. We repeat here the phasor diagram in Figure 4.17a, but 
with R1 = 0 (Figure 4.28).

For same power angle δV and V1, E1 should be larger for the salient pole rotor SG as Xd > Xq. The active 
power has two components: one due to the interaction of stator and rotor fields and the second one due 
the rotor magnetic saliency (Xd > Xq).
As in standard salient pole rotor SGs Xd/Xq < 1.7, the second term in Pe, called here saliency active 
power, is relatively small unless the SG is severely under excited: E1 ≪ V1. For given E1, V1, the SG reactive 
and active power delivery depend on the power (internal) angle δV (Figure 4.29).
The graphs in Figure 4.29 warrant the following remarks:
•	 The generating and motoring modes are characterized (for zero losses) by positive and, respec-
tively, negative power angles
•	 As δV increases up to the critical value δVK, which corresponds to maximum active power delivery 
P1K, the reactive power goes from leading to lagging for given emf E1, V1 frequency (speed) ω1.
•	 The reactive power is independent of the sign of power angle δV.

•	 In salient pole rotor SGs, the maximum power P1K for given V1, E1, and speed, is obtained for a 
power angle δVK < 90°, while for nonsalient pole rotor SGs (Xd = (1 − 1.05) Xq), δVK ≈ 90°.
•	 The rated power angle δVr is chosen in general around 22°–30° for nonsalient pole rotor SGs 
and around 30°–40° for salient pole rotor SGs. The lower speed, higher relative inertia, stronger 
damper cage of the latter might secure better stability, which justifies the lower power reserve 
(or ratio P1K/P1r).
4.10.2  V-Shaped Curves: I1(IF), P1 = ct, V1 = ct, n = ct
The V curves represent a family of I1(IF) curves, drawn at constant V1, speed (ω1), with active power P1 
as parameter.
The computation of V shape curve is rather straightforward once E1(IF)—no-load saturation curve—
and Xd and Xq are known. Unfortunately, when IF varies from low to large values so does I1 (i.e., Id and Iq); 
local magnetic saturation varies, despite of the fact that basically the total flux linkage Ψs ≈ V1/ω1 stays 
constant. This is due to rotor magnetic saliency (Xd ≠ Xq) where local saturation conditions vary rather 
notably. However, to a first approximation, for constant V1 and ω1 (i.e., Ψ1), with E1 calculated at a first 
fixed total flux, the value of MFA stays constant and thus E1 ≈ MFA⋅IF ≈ CFA⋅IF;  CFA ≈ (V1r/(ωrIF0)). IF0 is the 
field current value that produces E1 = V1r at no load.
For given IF, E1 = CFA × IF and P1 assigned a value from Equation 4.102, we may compute δV, then from 
Equation 4.105, the corresponding stator current I1 is found:

As expected, for given active delivered power, the minimum value of stator current is obtained for a field 
current IF corresponding to unity power factor (Q1 = 0). That is, (E1)I1min = (E1)Q1 = 0 may be determined 
from Equation 4.105 with δV already known from Equation 4.102. Then, IFK = E1/CFA. The maximum 
power angle admitted for a given power P1 limits the lowest field current admissible for steady state.
Finally, graphs as in Figure 4.30 are obtained.
Knowing the field current lower limit, for given active power, is paramount in avoiding an increase 
on the power angle above δVK. In fact δVK decreases with P1 raising.

4.10.3  Reactive Power Capability Curves
The maximum limitation of IF is due to thermal reasons. However, the SG heating depends on both I1 
and IF as both winding losses are very important. In addition, I1, IF, and δV determine the core losses in 
the machine at given speed.
When reactive power request is increased, the increase in IF raises the field winding losses and thus 
the stator winding losses, that is the active power P1, have to be limited.
The rationale for V-shape curves [6,7] may be continued to find the reactive power Q1 for the given 
P1 and IF. As shown in Figure 4.29, there are three distinct thermal limits: IF limit (vertical), I1 limit 
­(horizontal), and the end-winding overheating (inclined) limit at low values of field current.
To explain this latest, rather obscure, limitation, please refer to Figure 4.31.
For the underexcited SG the field current and armature-current-produced fields are having an angle 
smaller than 90° (the angle between IF and I1 in the phasor diagram). Consequently, their end wind-
ings fields more or less add to each other. This resultant end-region field enters at 90° the end-region 
­stator laminations and produces severe eddy current losses, which limit thermally the SG reactive power

absorption (Q1 < 0). This phenomenon is so strong because the retaining ring solid iron eddy currents 
(produced solely by the stator end-windings currents) are small and thus incapable of attentuating 
severely the end-region resultant field. This is because the solid iron retaining ring is not saturated mag-
netically as the field current is small. When the SG is overexcited, this phenomenon is not important 
because the stator and rotor fields are opposite (IF and I1 phase angle shift is above 90°), and the retaining 
magnetic ring is saturated by the large field current. Consequently, the stator end windings-current-
produced field in the stator penetrates first deeply into the retaining rings producing large eddy currents 
that further attenuate this resultant field in the end-region zone (the known short-circuit transformer 
effect on inductance).
Finally, the Q1(P1) curves are shown in Figure 4.32.
The reduction of hydrogen pressure leads to a reduction of reactive and active power capability of the 
machine.
As expected, the machine reactive power absorption capability (Q1 < 0) is notably smaller than 
reactive power delivery capability. Both, the end-region lamination loss limitation and the rise of 
power angle closer to its maximum limitation, seem responsible for such an asymmetric behavior 
(Figure 4.32).
4.10.4  Defining Static and Dynamic Stability of SGs
The fact that SGs require constant speed to deliver electric power at constant frequency introduces 
­special restrictions and precautionary measures to preserve SG stability, when tied to an electric power 
system (grid). The problem of stability is very complex. To preserve and extend it, active speed and voltage 
(active and reactive power) close loop controls are provided. We will deal in some detail with stability and 
control in a dedicated chapter. Here, we only introduce the problem in a more phenomenological manner. 
Two main concepts are standard in defining stability: static stability and dynamic stability.
The static stability is the property of SG to remain in synchronism to the power grid in presence of 
slow variations in the shaft power (output active power, when losses are neglected).

According to the rising side of P1(δV) curve (Figure 4.28), when the mechanical (shaft) power increases 
so does the power angle δV as the rotor slowly advances ahead the phase of E1, with the phase of V1 as 
fixed. When δV increases, the active power delivered electrically, by the SG, increases.
This way, the energy balance is kept and no important energy increment is accumulated in the 
SG’s inertia. The speed stays constant but when P1 increases, so does δV. The SG is statically stable if 
∂P1/∂δV > 0.
We denote by P1S, this power derivative with angle and call it synchronization power:

P1S is maximum at δV = 0 and decreases to zero when δV increases toward δVK, where P1S = 0.
At the extent that the field current decreases so does δVK and thus the static stability region dimin-
ishes. In reality, the SG is allowed to operate at values of δV, notably below δVK to preserve dynamic 
stability.
The dynamic stability is the property of the SG to remain in synchronism (with the power grid) in the 
presence of quick variations of shaft power or of electric load short circuit, etc.
As the combined inertia of SGs and their prime movers is relatively large, the speed and power angle 
transients are much slower than electrical (current and voltage) transients. Therefore, for example, we 
can still consider the SG under electromagnetic steady state when the shaft power (water admission in a 
hydraulic turbine) varies to produce slow speed and power angle transients. The electromagnetic torque 
Te is thus, still, approximately,

Let us consider a step variation of shaft power from Psh1 to Psh2 (Figure 4.33a) in a lossless SG.
The SG power angle power angle should vary slowly from δV1 to δV2. In reality, the power angle δV 
will overshoot δV2 and, after a few attenuated oscillations, will settle at δV2 if the machine remains in 
synchronism.

Only when the two areas are equal to each other, there is the possibility that the SG will come back from 
B′ to B after a few attenuated oscillations. Attenuation comes from the asynchronous torque of damper 
cage currents, neglected so far.
This is the so-called criterion of areas.
The maximum shaft torque or electric power step variation that can be accepted with the machine 
still remaining in synchronism is shown in Figure 4.34a and b and corresponds to the case when point 
C coincides with C′.

Let us illustrate the dynamic stability by the situation of a loaded SG at power angle δV1. A three-
phase short-circuit occurs at δV1 with its transients attenuated very quickly such that the electromag-
netic torque is zero (V1 = 0, zero losses also).
Therefore, the SG starts accelerating until the short circuit is cleared at δVsc, which corresponds to a 
few tens of a second at most. Then the electromagnetic torque Te becomes larger than the shaft torque 
and the SG decelerates. Only if the

there are chances for the SG to remain in synchronism; that, is to be dynamically stable.
4.11  Unbalanced Load Steady-State Operation
SGs connected to the power grid, but especially those in autonomous applications, operate often on 
unbalanced three-phase loads.
That is, the stator currents in the three phases have different amplitudes and their phasing differs 
from 120°:

Unfortunately, the superposition of the current sets flux linkages is admissible only in the absence of 
magnetic saturation. Let us suppose that the SG is indeed unsaturated and lossless (R1 = 0).
For the direct components IA+, IB+, IC+, which produce a forward-traveling mmf at rotor speed, the 
theory unfolded so far still holds. Therefore, let us write the voltage equation for phase A and direct

The inverse (negative) components of stator currents IA−, IB−, IC− produce an mmfs that travels at opposite 
rotor speed −ωr.
The relative angular speed of the inverse mmf with respect to rotor speed is thus 2ωr. Consequently, 
voltages and currents are induced in the rotor damper windings and in the field winding at 2ωr fre-
quency, in general. The behavior is similar to an induction machine at slip S = 2, but which has nonsym-
metrical windings on the rotor and nonuniform air gap. We may approximate the SG behavior with 
respect to the inverse component as follows:

Unless the stator windings are not symmetric or some of the field coils have short circuited turns EA− = 0. 
Z− is the inverse impedance of the machine and represents a kind of multiple winding rotor induction 
machine impedance at 2ωr frequency.
The homopolar components of currents produce mmfs in the three phases that are phase-shifted 
spatially by 120° and have the same amplitude and time phasing. They produce a zero-traveling field 
in the air gap and thus do not interact with the rotor in terms of the fundamental component. The 
­corresponding homopolar impedance is Z0 ≈ R1 + jX0 and

Similar equations are valid for the other two phases. We have assimilated here the homopolar with 
the stator leakage reactance (X1l ≈ X0). Truth is that this assertion is not valid if chorded coils are 
used, when X0 < X1l. It seems that due to the placement of stator winding in slots, the stator homo-
polar mmf has a step-like distribution with τ/3 as half-period and does not rotate; it is an AC field.

This third space-harmonic-like mmf may be decomposed in a forward and backward wave, and both 
move with respect to rotor and induce eddy currents at least in the damper cage. Additional losses 
occur in the rotor occur. As we are not prepared by now theoretically to calculate Z− and X0, we refer 
to some experiments to measure them so that we get some confidence in using the aforementioned 
theory of ­symmetrical components.
4.12  Measuring Xd, Xq, Z−, Z0
We will treat here some basic measurements procedures for SG reactances: Xd, Xq, Z−, Z0. For example, 
to measure Xd and Xq, the open field winding SG, supplied with symmetric forward voltages (ωr0, fre-
quency) through a variable-ratio transformer, is driven at speed ωr very close but different from the 
stator frequency ωr0 (Figure 4.36):

We need not measure this speed precisely, but we need to notice the slow pulsation in the stator current 
with frequency ωr − ωr0 ≈ (0.01–0.02)ωr0.
Identifying the maxima and minima in the stator voltage VA(t) and current IA(t) leads to approximate

The slip S = (ωr − ωr0)/ωr0 has to be very small so that the currents induced in the rotor damper cage may 
be neglected. If they are not negligible, Xd and Xq are smaller than in reality due to the damper eddy 
current screening effect.
The saturation level will be medium if currents around or above rated value are used.
Identifying the voltage and current maxima, even if the voltage and current are digitally acquired and 
off-line processed in a computer, is doable with practical precision.
The inverse- (negative-) sequence impedance Z− may be measured by driving the rotor, with the 
field winding short circuited, at synchronous speed ωr, while feeding the stator with a purely negative 
sequence of low level voltages (Figure 4.37).

A few remarks are in order:
•	 Equation 4.134 with the known no-load magnetization curve, and the measured short-circuit cur-
rent Isc2, apparently allows for the computation of negative impedance if the positive one jX+ = jXd, 
for nonsalient pole rotor SG is given. Unfortunately, the phase shift between EA1 and Isc2 is hard to 
measure. Thus, if we only let:
	
Z− ≈ −jX−	
(4.135)
	
	 Equation 4.134 becomes usable as

(4.136)
	
	 RMS values enter Equation 4.136.
•	 Apparently, Equation 4.133 provides a good way of computing the negative impedance Z− directly, 
with VA and Isc2 measured. Their phase shift can be measured if the SG null point is used as com-
mon point for VA and I2sc measurements.
•	 During short circuit, be it phase to phase, the air gap magnetic flux density is small, but also dis-
torted. Therefore, it is not easy to verify Equation 4.131 unless the voltage VA and current Isc2 are 
first filtered to extract the fundamental.
•	 Thus, only Equation 4.134 can be used directly to approximate X−, with X+ unsaturated known. 
As X+ ≫ X− for strong damper cage rotors, the precision of computing X− from the sum (X+ + X−) 
is not so good.
•	 In a similar way as above for the single-phase short circuit (Figure 4.39b):

	 for an SG with a strong damper cage rotor.
•	 EA+ should be calculated for the real-field current IF, but, as during short circuit the real saturation 
level is low, the unsaturated value of XFA should be used: EA+ = If(XFA)unsaturated.
•	 Small autonomous SGs may have the null available for single-phase loads, and thus the homopo-
lar component shows up.
•	 The negative sequence currents in the stator produces double frequency-induced currents in the rotor 
damper cage and in the field windings. If the field winding is supplied from a static power converter, 
the latter may prevent the occurrence of AC currents in the field winding. Consequently notable 
overvoltages may occur in the latter. They should be considered when designing the field winding 
power electronics supply. Also, the double-frequency currents in the damper cage, produced by the 
negative component set, have to be limited as they affect the rotor overtemperature. Therefore, the 
ratio I−/I+, that is the level of current unbalance, is limited by standards below 10%–12%.
•	 A similar phenomenon occurs in autonomous SGs where the acceptable level of current unbal-
ance I−/If is given as a specification item and then considered in the thermal design. Finally, exper-
iments are needed to make sure that the SG can really stand the predicted current unbalance.

•	 The phase-to-phase or single-phase short circuits are extreme cases of unbalanced load. The sym-
metrical components method presented here can be used for actual load unbalance situations 
where the +, −, 0 current components sets may be calculated first. A numerical example follows:
Example 4.3
A three-phase lossless two pole SG with Sn = 100 kVA, at V1l = 440 V and f1 = 50 Hz has the fol-
lowing parameters: x+ = xd = xq = 0.6 pu, x− = 0.2 pu, x0 = 0.12 pu and supplies a single-phase-
resistive load at rated current. Calculate the load resistance and the phase voltages VA, VB, VC if 
the no-load voltage E1l = 500 V.
Solution
We start with the computation of symmetrical current components sets (with IB = IC = 0):

The phase voltages are not symmetric anymore (VA = 278 V, VB = 282.67 V, VC = 285 V). The voltage 
regulation is not very large as x+ = 0.6, and the phase voltage unbalance is not large either since 
the homopolar reactance is usually small, x0 = 0.12. And so is X– due to a strong damper cage on 
the rotor. A small x+ presupposes a notably large air gap and thus the field winding mmf should be 
rather large to produce acceptable values of flux density in the air gap on no load (BgFm = 0.7–0.9 T), 
to secure a reasonable volume SG.

4.14  Synchronous Condenser
As already pointed out earlier in this chapter, the reactive power capability of a synchronous machine is basi-
cally the same for motor or generating mode (Figure 4.28b). It is thus feasible to use a synchronous machine 
as a motor without any mechanical load, connected to the local power grid (system), to “deliver” or “drain” 
reactive power and thus contribute to the overall power factor correction or (and) local voltage control.
The reactive power flow is controlled through field current control (Figure 4.41).
The phasor diagram (with zero losses) springs from voltage equation (Equation 4.54) with Iq = 0 and 
R1 = 0 (Figure 4.42)

Also, Xd should not vary notably for constant voltage V1. The maximum delivered reactive power depends 
on Id, but the thermal design should account for both stator and rotor field winding losses, together with 
core losses located in the stator core.
Therefore, it seems that the synchronous condenser should be designed at maximum delivered (posi-
tive) reactive power Q1max:

To reduce the size of such a machine acting as a no-load motor, two pole rotor configurations seem 
appropriate.
The synchronous condenser is in fact a positive/negative reactance with continuous control through 
field current via a low power rating AC–DC converter.
It does not introduce significant voltage or current harmonics in the power systems. However, it 
makes noise, has a sizeable volume, experience losses and needs maintenance. These are a few reasons 
for the increase in use of pulse-width modulator (PWM) converter controlled capacitors in parallel with 
inductors to control voltage in power systems.
Existing synchronous motors are also used whenever possible, to control reactive power and voltage 
locally while driving their loads, or on no-load, in synchronous condenser operation mode.
4.15  PM-Assisted DC-Excited Salient Pole 
Synchronous Generators
Small and medium (tens of kW to MW/unit) SGs with salient-pole vectors can benefit from the assis-
tance of permanent magnets placed between rotor poles (Figure 4.43) to [8]:
•	 Reduce DC excitation leakage flux between rotor poles
•	 Reduce the magnetic saturation level in the rotor under load
The main advantage is that increase in air gap flux produced by rotor for smaller field current and thus 
20%–25% more power at better efficiency is obtained.

179
Large- and Medium-Power Synchronous Generators
Care must be exercised in designing and placing the PMs between rotor poles to avoid their local 
demagnetization in the most critical operation modes (sudden short circuits, etc.). Adding damper 
bars above the PMs (between rotor poles) screens the PMs from high armature transient reaction fields.
In a case study [8] referring to a 2.3 MVA, 3 phase, 8 pole, 50 Hz, 650 V, 2021 A, SG, with a stator 
diameter of 1240 mm and a stack length of 507 mm, additional NdFeB (Br = 1.19 T) produce a notable 
increase in the no load line voltage (Figure 4.44).

The no load voltage increase is produced two ways:

2.)>> By the reduction of excitation flux leakage between adjacent rotor poles, but without strong PM
While the power factor is affected [8], the field current is notably reduced (for given armature current), 
Figure 4.45a, which is reflected into a larger efficiency (Figure 4.45b), as also proved in laboratory work 
at small power [8].
It should be noted the total amount of PMs is significantly smaller than in permanent magnet SGs 
of equivalent power and speed; which makes the solution very tempting/practical.

4.16  Multiphase Synchronous Machine Inductances 
via Winding Function Method
Three-phase SGs are standard by now. But, especially when used with static power converters for vari-
able speed, more than three-phase stator windings are introduced to:
•	 Reduce the switching frequency in the static power converters, required by either power increase 
or fundamental frequency (or speed) increase
•	 Reduce the power per phase, to reduce power electronics costs and increase redundancy (reliabil-
ity) by increased fault tolerance
While phases 6, 9, 12, and 15 are typical, phases 5, 7, 11, and 13 may also be used. The current in the phases 
is not necessarily sinusoidal; and thus in an inverter/rectifier with a null point, the phase current sum-
mation is not zero anymore. It is not zero even with sinusoidal current in a six-phase winding with a 
30° electrical shift between phases. Therefore, an additional inverter leg in the converter is provided and 
controlled to symmetrize the phase currents. For an odd number of phases, this null current is about 
equal to the phase current, while it is doubled for even number of phases (e.g., six phases).
Let us consider here, for simplicity, an “m” phase SG whose phases are shifted by α = π/m (asymmetric 
winding: for m = 6, α = π/6 = 30°), Figure 4.46.
According to Reference [9], a rather comprehensive modified winding function method can be 
used to develop an analytical circuit model to calculate the machine inductance matrix that com-
pares favorably with the FEM results, as long as magnetic saturation is small and there is no damper 
cage on the rotor.
In essence, each machine inductance lij is made of a leakage, llij and an air gap component, lmij; the 
latter is dependent on rotor position θer. While the leakage inductances have rather standard analytical 
formulae, the air gap (magnetization) one may be written as follows:

The FEM calculated functions: f(ξ) and pr(ξ−θer) may be decomposed in harmonics h(1, 3, 5,…) and 
eij(θer) may be detailed further; in a similar way, the neutral inductances between stator and excitation 
winding can be derived [9].
Finally, in the absence of magnetic saturation, the FEM calculated and MWF calculated inductances 
show remarkable agreement in their dependence on rotor position θr = x in radians (Figure 4.48). The 
same good agreement was proven by the no-load voltage waveform with validation through test results, 
also [9].
4.17  Summary
•	 Large and medium power SGs are built with DC excitation windings on the rotor with either 
salient or nonsalient poles.
•	 Salient rotor poles are built for 2p1 > 4 poles and nonsalient rotor poles for 2p1 = 2,4.
•	 The stator core of SGs is made of silicon-steel laminations (0.5 mm thick in general) with uniform 
slotting. The slots house the three-phase windings.

•)>> The stator core is made of one piece only if the outer diameter is below 1 m, otherwise it is made 
of segments. Sectionable cores are wound section by section and the wound sections are mounted 
together at the user’s site.
•)>> The slots in SGs are in general open, provided with nonmagnetic or magnetic wedges (to reduce 
emf harmonic content).
•)>> Stator windings are of single- and double-layered type and are made of lap (multiturn) coils or the 
bar-wave (single-turn) coils (to reduce the lengthy connections between coils).
•)>> Stator windings are built in general with integer slots/pole/phase q; only for large number of poles 
2p1 > 16–20, q may be fractionary: 3.5, 4.5 (to reduce emf harmonics content).
•)>> The symmetric AC currents of stator windings produce a positive mmf wave that travels with the 
ω1/p1 angular speed (with respect to the stator) ω1 = 2πf1, f1 is the frequency of currents.
•)>> The core of salient pole rotors is made of a solid iron pole wheel spider on top of which 2p1 salient 
poles made in general of laminations (1 mm thick in general) are placed. The poles are attached to 
the pole wheel spider through hammer or dove-tail keybars or bolts and screws with end plates.
•)>> Nonsalient pole rotors are made of solid iron with machined radial slots over two-thirds of periph-
ery to house distributed field winding coils. Costs constrained and higher peripheral speeds have 
led to solid cores for nonsalient poles rotors with 2p1 = 2,4 poles.
•)>> The rotor poles are provided with additional (smaller) slots filled with copper or brass bars short 
circuited by partial or total end rings. This is the damper winding. A complete damper winding 
(with a short-circuit end ring) is required to reduce the open phase peak voltage during line to 
line short circuit.
•)>> The air gap flux density produced by the rotor field windings has a fundamental and space harmon-
ics. They are to be limited in order to reduce the stator emf (no-load voltage) harmonics. Larger air 
gap under the salient poles is used for the scope. Uniform air gap is used for nonsalient poles because 
their distributed field coils produce lower harmonics in the air gap flux density. The design air gap 
flux density flat top value is about 0.7–0.8 T in large and medium power SGs. The emf harmonics 
may be further reduced by the type of the stator winding (larger or fractionary q, chorded coils).
•)>> The air gap flux density of the rotor field winding currents is a traveling wave at rotor speed Ωr = ωr/p1.
•)>> When ωr = ω1, the stator AC currents and rotor DC currents air gap fields are at standstill with 
each other. These conditions lead to an interaction between the two fields with nonzero average 
electromagnetic torque. This is the speed of synchronism or the synchronous speed.
•)>> When an SG is driven at the speed ωr (electrical rotor angular speed; Ωr = ωr/p1 is the mechanical 
rotor speed), the field rotor DC currents produce emfs in the stator windings whose frequency ω1 
is ω1 = ωr. If a balanced three-phase load is connected to the stator terminals, the occurring stator 
currents will naturally have the same frequency ω1 = ωr; their mmf will, consequently, produce an 
air gap traveling field at the speed ω1 = ωr. Their phase shift with respect to phase emfs depends 
on load character (inductive-resistive or capacitive-resistive) and on SG reactances (not discussed 
yet). This is the principle of SG.
•)>> The air gap field of stator AC currents is called armature reaction.
•)>> The phase stator currents may be decomposed in two components (Id, Iq), one in phase with the 
emf and the other at 90°. Thus two mmfs are obtained, whose air gap fields are at standstill with 
respect to the moving rotor. One along d (rotor pole) axis—called longitudinal—and the other 
one along q axis, called transverse. This decomposition is the core of two-reaction theory of SGs.
•)>> The two stator mmfs field are tied to rotor d and q axes and thus their cyclic magnetization 
reactances Xdm and Xqm may be easily calculated. Leakage reactances are added to get Xd, Xq the 
synchronous reactances. With zero damper currents and DC field currents on the rotor, the 
steady-state voltage equation is straightforward:

•)>> The SG “delivers” both active and reactive power P1 and Q1. They both depend on Xd, Xq, R1 and 
on the power angle δV—the phase angle between the emf and terminal voltage (phase variables).
•)>> Core losses may be included in the SG equations at steady state as pure resistive short circuited 
stator fictitious windings whose currents are produced by the resultant air gap or stator phase 
linkage.
•)>> The SG loss components are stator winding losses, stator core losses, rotor field winding losses, 
additional losses (mainly in the rotor damper cage), and mechanical losses. The efficiency of large 
SGs is very good (above 98%, total, including field winding losses).
•)>> The SGs may operate in standalone applications or connected to the local (or regional) power 
system. No load, short circuit, zero power factor saturation curves, together with output V1(I1) 
curve fully characterize standalone operation with balanced load. Voltage regulation tends to be 
large with SGs as the synchronous reactances in PU (xd or xq) are larger than 0.5–0.6, to limit the 
rotor field winding losses.
•)>> Operation of SGs at power system is characterized by the angular curve P1(δV), V-shape curves 
I1(IF) for P1 = ct and the reactive power capability Q1(P1).
•)>> The P1(δV) curve shows a single maximum value at δVK ≤ 90°; this critical angle decreases when the 
field current IF decreases for constant stator terminal voltage V1 and speed.
•)>> Static stability is defined as the property of SG to remain at synchronism for slow shaft torque 
variations. Basically up to δV = δVK, the SG is statically stable.
•)>> The dynamic stability is defined as the property of the SG to remain in synchronism for fast shaft 
torque or electric power (short circuiting until clearing) transients. The area criterion is used to 
forecast the reserve of dynamic stability for each transient. Dynamic stability limits the rated 
power angle to 22°–40°, much less than its maximum value δVK ≤ 90°.
•)>> The stand-alone SG may encounter unbalanced loads. The symmetrical components (Fortesque) 
method may be applied to describe SG operation under such conditions, provided saturation 
level does not change (or is absent). Impedances for the negative and zero components of stator 
currents, Z− and Z0, are defined and basic methods to measure them are described. In general 
|Z+ |>|Z−|>|Z0|, and thus the stator phase voltage unbalance under unbalanced loads is not very 
large. However, the negative-sequence stator currents induce voltages and thus produce currents 
of double stator frequency in the rotor damper cage and field winding. Additional losses are 
thus present. They have to be limited, to keep rotor temperature within reasonable limits. The 
maximum I−/I+ ratio is standardized (for power system SGs) or specified (for stand-alone SGs).
•)>> The synchronous machine acting as a motor with no shaft load is used for reactive power absorp-
tion (IF small) or delivery (IF large). This regime is called “synchronous condenser” since the 
machine is seen by the local power system either as a capacitor (IF large, overexcited E1 > V1) or as 
an inductor (IF small, under-excited machine E1/V1 < 1). Its role is to raise or control local power 
factor or voltage in the power system.
•)>> Inter-rotor-pole PMs in SG have been shown to increase output by more than 20% for slightly 
better efficiency.
•)>> Multiphase (5, 7, 11, 6, 12) SG may be used when full power electronics control of output is used, to 
reduce system losses and costs; modified winding function method has been shown instrumental in 
calculating their inductance matrix in absence of magnetic saturation; when FEM usage is mandatory.

Synchronous Generators: 
Modeling for Transients
5.1  Introduction
Chapter 4 dealt with the synchronous generator (SG) principles and steady state based on the two reac-
tion theories. In essence, the concept of traveling field (rotor) and stator (stator) mmfs and air gap fields 
at standstill with each other has been presented.
Each stator phase current can be decomposed in two components under the steady state: one in phase 
with the emf and the other phase-shifted by 90°.
Two stator mmfs both traveling at rotor speed have been identified. One of these produces an airgap 
field whose maximum is aligned to the rotor poles (d axis), whereas the other is aligned to the q axis 
(between poles).
The d and q axis magnetization inductances Xdm, Xqm are thus defined. The voltage equations with 
balanced three-phase stator currents, under steady state, are then obtained.
Further on, this equation is exploited to derive all performance aspects for steady state when no 
currents are induced into the rotor damper winding, and the field-winding current is direct (unipo-
lar). Though unbalanced load steady state was also investigated, the negative-sequence impedance Z− 
could not be explained theoretically, and thus a basic experiment to measure it has been described 
in Chapter 4. Further on, during transients, when the stator current amplitude and frequency, rotor 
damper, and field currents and speed vary, a more general (advanced) model is required to handle the 
machine behavior properly.
Advanced models for transients include the following
•	 The phase-variable model
•	 The orthogonal axis (dq) model
•	 Finite element (FE)/circuit model
The first two models are essentially lumped circuit models, while the third model is a coupled, field 
(distributed parameter) and circuit, model.
Also, the first two are analytical models while the third is a numerical model. The presence of solid 
iron rotor core, damper windings, and distributed field coils on the rotor of nonsalient rotor pole SGs 
(turbo-generators, 2p1 = 2,4) further complicates the FE/circuit model to account for the eddy currents 
in the solid iron rotor—so influenced by local magnetic saturation level.
In view of such a complex problem, in this chapter we begin with the phase coordinate model whose 
inductances (some of them) are dependent on rotor position, that is, time. To get rid of rotor position 

188

dependence of self- and mutual (stator/rotor) inductances, the dq model is used. Its derivation is straight-
forward through the Park matrix transform. The dq model is then exploited to describe the steady state. 
Further on, the operational parameters are presented and used to portray electromagnetic (constant 
speed) transients such as the three-phase sudden short circuit, etc.
A rather extended discussion on magnetic saturation inclusion into the dq model is then housed and 
illustrated for steady state and transients.
The electromechanical transients (speed variation too) are presented both for small perturbations 
(through linearization) and large perturbations, respectively. For the latter case, numerical solutions of 
state space equations are required, and are therefore illustrated.
Mechanical (or slow) transients, such as SG free or forced “oscillations,” are presented for electromag-
netic steady state.
Simplified dq models, adequate for power system stability studies, are introduced and justified in 
some detail. Illustrative examples are worked out. The asynchronous running is also presented as it is 
the regime that shows up the asynchronous (damping) torque, so critical to SG stability and control. 
Though the operational parameters with s = jω lead to various SG parameters and time constants, their 
analytical expressions are given in Chapter 7 (on design) and their measurement is presented as part of 
Chapter 8, on testing.
The chapter ends with some FE/coupled circuit models related to SG steady state and transients.
5.2  Phase-Variable Model
The phase-variable model is a circuit model. Consequently, the SG is described by a set of three stator 
circuits coupled through motion with two (or a multiple of two) orthogonally placed (d and q) damper 
windings and a field winding (along axis d: of largest magnetic permeance)—Figure 5.1.
The stator and rotor circuits are magnetically coupled with each other.
It should be noted that the convention of voltage–current signs (directions) is based on the respec-
tive circuit nature: source on the stator and sink on the rotor. This is in agreement with Poynting vector 
direction, toward the circuit for the sink and outward for the source (Figure 5.1).

Let us now define the stator phase self- and mutual inductances LAA, LBB, LCC, LAB, LBC, LCA for a salient-
pole rotor SG. For now, let us consider the stator and rotor magnetic cores of having infinite magnetic 
permeability.
As already demonstrated in Chapter 4, the magnetic permeance of air gap along axes d and q differ 
(Figure 5.2).
The phase A mmf has a sinusoidal space distribution, because all space harmonics are neglected.
The magnetic permeance of the air gap is maximum in axis d, Pd, and minimum in axis q and may be 
approximated to the following:

Therefore, the air gap self-inductance of phase A depends on that of a uniform air gap machine (single-

accentuated magnetic saturation level along axis q where the distributed field coil slots are located.

The mutual inductance between phases is considered to be only in relation to air gap permeances. It is

FE analysis of field distribution with only one phase supplied with DC current could provide ground 
for more exact approximations of self- and mutual stator inductance dependence on θer. Based on this, 
additional terms in cos(4θer), even 6θer may be added. For fractionary q windings, more intricate θer 
dependences may be developed.
The mutual inductances between stator phases and rotor circuits are straightforward as they vary 
with cos (θer) and sin (θer).

The phase-variable equations constitute an eighth-order model with time-variable coefficients 
(inductances).
Such a system may be solved as it is either with flux linkages vector as the variable or with the current 
vector as the variable, together with speed ωr and rotor position θer as motion variables.
Numerical methods such as Runge–Kutta–Gill or predictor–corrector may be used to solve the 
system for various transient or steady-state regimes, once the initial values of all variables are given. 
Also, the time variation of voltages and of shaft torque must be known. Inverting the matrix of time-­
dependent inductances at every time integration step is however a tedious job. Moreover, as it is, the 
phase-variable model does offer little in terms of interpreting the various phenomena and operation 
modes in an intuitive manner.
This is how the dq model has been developed out of the necessity to solve quickly various transient 
operation modes of SGs connected to the power grid (or in parallel).
5.3  dq Model
The main aim of the dq model is to eliminate the dependence of inductances on rotor position. To do 
so, the system of coordinates should be attached to the machine part that has magnetic saliency—the 
rotor, for SGs.
The dq model should express both stator and rotor equations in rotor coordinates, aligned to rotor d 
and q axis because, at least in the absence of magnetic saturation, there is no coupling between the two 
orthogonal axes. The rotor windings f, D, and Q are already aligned along d and q axes. The rotor circuits 
voltage equations have been written in rotor coordinates in Equation 5.1.

It is only the stator voltages, VA, VB, VC, currents IA, IB, IC, flux linkages ΨA, ΨB, ΨC that have to be 
transformed to rotor orthogonal coordinates.
The transformation of coordinates ABC—dq0, known also as the Park transform, valid for voltages, 
currents and flux linkages as well is

As can be seen in Equation 5.37, the zero components of stator flux and current Ψ0, I0 are related simply 
by the stator phase leakage inductance Lsl, and thus they do not participate in the energy conversion 
through the fundamental components of mmfs and fields in the SGs.
It is thus acceptable to consider it separately. Consequently, the dq transformation may be visualized 
as representing a fictitious SG with orthogonal stator axes fixed magnetically to the rotor d–q axes. The 
magnetic field axes of the respective stator windings are fixed to the rotor d–q axes, but their conductors

(coils) are at standstill (Figure 5.3)—fixed to the stator. The dq model equations may also be derived 
directly through the equivalent fictitious orthogonal axis machine (Figure 5.3).

The assumptions are true if the windings dq are sinusoidally distributed and the air gap is constant

to a good approximation only if the air gap flux density fundamental is considered. The null (zero)

Note that resistances and leakage inductances are reduced by same coefficients, as expected for power 
balance.
A few remarks are in order:
•	 The “physical” dq model in Figure 5.4. presupposes that there is a single common (main) flux 
linkage along each of the two orthogonal axes that embrace all windings along those axes.
•	 The flux/current relationships of Equation 5.46 for the rotor uses stator-reduced rotor current, 
inductances, and flux linkage variables. In order to be valid, the approximations:

	 have to be accepted.
•	 The validity of approximations of Equation 5.57 is related to the condition that air gap field dis-
tribution produced by stator, and, respectively, rotor currents is the same. As far as the space 
fundamental is concerned, this condition holds. Once heavy local magnetic saturation conditions 
occur, Equation 5.57 depart from reality.
•	 No leakage flux coupling between the d axis damper cage and the field winding (LfDl = 0) has been 
considered thus far, though in salient-pole rotors LfDl ≠ 0 may be needed to properly assess the SG 
transients, especially in the field winding.

machine.
•	 The reduced number of inductances in of Equation 5.57 should be instrumental in their ­estimation 
(through experiments).

201

Note:  When 2 3/  is used in the Park transform (matrix) Kf, KD, and KQ in Equation 5.47 have to be all 
multiplied by 3 2/ , but the factor 2/3 (or 3/2) disappears completely from Equations 5.48 through 5.57

to relationships Equations 5.47, 5.54, 5.55, and 5.56 the P.U. dq model requires base quantities only for

Though the selection of base quantities leaves room for choice, the following set is rather widely 
accepted:

tshaft(t) are needed to investigate any transient or steady-state regime of the machine. Finally, the stator 
currents of the d–q model (id, iq) are transformed back into iA, iB, iC to find the real machine stator cur-
rents, behavior for the case in point.
The field-winding current If and the damper cage currents ID, IQ are the same for the dq model and for 
the original machine. Note that all the quantities in Equation 5.68 are reduced to stator and thus directly 
related in P.U. to stator base quantities.
In Equation 5.68, all quantities except for time t and H are in P.U. (time t and inertia H are given in 
seconds and ωb in rad/s).
Equations 5.68 represent the dq0 model of a three-phase SG with single damper circuits along rotor 
orthogonal axes d and q.
Also, the coupling of windings along axis d, and, respectively, q takes place only through the main 
(air gap) flux linkage.
Magnetic saturation is not yet included, and only the fundamental of air gap flux distribution is 
considered.
Instead of P.U. inductances ldm, lqm, lfl, lDl, and lQl, the corresponding reactances may be used: xdm, 
xqm, xfl, xDl, and xQl, as the two sets are identical (in numbers, in P.U.). Also, ld = lsl + ldm, xd = xsl+xdm, 
lq = lsl+ldm, xq = xsl + xqm.

5.5  Steady State via the dq Model
During steady state, the stator voltages and currents are sinusoidal and the stator frequency ω1 is equal

The space-phasor (or vector) diagram corresponding to Equation 5.74 is shown in Figure 5.5.
With φ1 > 0, both the active and reactive power delivered by the SG are positive. This condition implies 
that Id0 goes against If0 in the vector diagram; also, for generating, Iq0 falls along the negative direction of 
axis q. Note that axis q is ahead of axis d in the direction of motion and, for φ1 > 0, Is0 and Vs0 are contained 
in the third quadrant. Also, the positive direction of motion is trigonometric. The voltage vector Vs0 will stay 
in the third quadrant (for generating), while Is0 may be placed either in the third or fourth quadrant. We 
may use Equation 5.72 to calculate the stator currents Id0, Iq0 provided Vd0 and Vq0 are known.
The initial angle θ0 of Park transformation represents, in fact, the angle between the rotor pole (d axis) 
axis and the voltage vector angle. Axis d is behind Vs0, and this is explained in Figure 5.5:

Example 5.1
A hydrogenerator with 200 MVA, 24 kV (star connection), 60 Hz, unity power factor, at 90 rpm 
has the following P.U. parameters: ldm = 0.6, lqm = 0.4, lsl = 0.15, rs = 0.003, lfl = 0.165, and rf = 0.006. 
The field circuit is supplied at 800 V DC. (Vf
r = 800 V).
When the generator works at rated MVA, cosφ1 = 1 and rated terminal voltage, calculate the 
following:
	
(i)	 The internal angle δV0
	 (ii)	 P.U. values of Vd0, Vq0, Id0, Iq0
	 (iii)	 Air gap torque in P.U. and in Nm
	 (iv)	 The P.U. field current If0 and its actual value in Amperes

Solution
	
(i)	 The vector diagram simplifies as cosφ1 = 1 (φ1 = 0), but it is worth deriving a formula to 
directly calculate the power angle δv0.

5.6  General Equivalent Circuits
Let us replace d/dt in the P.U. dq model (Equation 5.68) by the Laplace operator s/ωb, which means that 
the initial conditions are implicitly zero. If they are not, their initial values should be added.
The general equivalent circuits illustrate Equation 5.68 with d/dt replaced by s/ωb after separating the 
main flux linkage components Ψdm, Ψqm:

Equation 5.82 contains three circuits in parallel along axis d and two equivalent circuits along axis q. It 
is also implicit that the coupling of the circuits along axis d and q is performed only through the main 
flux components Ψdm and Ψqm.
Magnetic saturation and frequency effects are not yet considered.
Based on Equations 5.82, the general equivalent circuits of SG are shown in Figure 5.6.
A few remarks on Figure 5.6 are as follows:
•	 The magnetization current components Idm and Iqm are defined as the sum of the dq model 
currents:

is either ignored or considered separately along each axis as follows:

•	 Should the frequency (skin) effect be present in the rotor damper cage (or in the rotor pole solid 
iron), additional rotor circuits are added in parallel. In general, one additional circuit along axis 
d and two along axis q are sufficient even for solid-rotor pole SGs (Figure 5.6). In these cases, 
additional equations have to be added to Equation 5.82, but their composure is straightforward.
•	 Figure 5.6a also exhibits the possibility to consider the additional, leakage type, flux linkage 
(inductance, lfDl) between the field and damper cage windings, in salient-pole rotors. This induc-
tance is considered instrumental when the field-winding parameter identification is checked after 
the stator parameters have been estimated in tests with measured stator variables. Sometimes, lfDl 
is estimated as negative.

•	 For steady state s = 0 in the equivalent circuits, and thus the voltages VAB and VCD are zero. 
Consequently, ID0 = IQ0 = 0, Vf0 = −rf If0 and the steady-state dq model equations may be “read” 
from Figure 5.6.
•	 The null component voltage equation in Equation 5.81, V0 + (r0 + (s/ωb)l0)i0 = 0, does not appear, as 
expected, in the general equivalent circuit because it does not interfere with the main flux funda-
mental. In reality, the null component may produce some eddy currents in the rotor cage through 
its third space harmonic mmf.
5.7  Magnetic Saturation Inclusion in the dq Model
The magnetic saturation level is, in general, different in various regions of SG cross-section. Also the 
distribution of the flux density in the air gap is not quite sinusoidal.
However, in the dq model, only the flux–density fundamental is considered.
Further on, the leakage flux paths saturation is influenced by the main flux paths saturation. A fully 
realistic model of saturation would mean that all leakage and main inductances depend on all currents 
in the dq model.
However, such a model would be too cumbersome to be practical.
Consequently, we will present here only two main approximations of magnetic saturation inclusion 
in the dq model from the many proposed so far [2–7]. These two appear to us to be rather representative. 
Both of them include cross-coupling between the two orthogonal axes due to main flux path satura-
tion. While the first one presupposes the existence of an unique magnetization curve along axis d, and, 
respectively q, in relation to total mmf (I

Each of transient inductances in Equation 5.84 is considered as dependent on the respective current.
5.7.1  The Single dq Magnetization Curve Model

Note:  The two distinct, but unique, d and q axes magnetization curves, shown in Figure 5.7, represent 
a disputable approximation. It is only recently that FEM investigations have shown that the concept 
of unique magnetization curves does not hold with the SG for underexcited (draining reactive power) 
conditions [4]: Im < 0.7 P.U.
For Im > 0.7, the model apparently works well for a wide range of active and reactive power load 
conditions.

The equality of coupling transient inductances ldqm = lqdm between the two axes is based on the reciproc-
ity theorem. ldmt and lqmt are the so-called differential d and q axes magnetization inductances, while lddm 
and lqqm are the transient magnetization self-inductances with saturation included.
All these four inductances depend, in fact, on both Idm and Iqm, while ldm, ldmt, lqm, and lqmt depend only on Im.
For the situation when DC premagnetization occurs, the differential magnetization inductances ldmt 
and lqmt should be replaced by the so-called incremental inductances l

ldm

The normal permeability of iron µn = Bm/Hm is used when calculating the magnetization inductances 
ldm and lqm, µd = dBm/dHm for ldm

t  and µi = ΔBm/ΔHm (Figure 5.8) for the incremental magnetiza-
tion inductances lmd

For the incremental inductances, the permeability µi corresponds to a local small hysteresis cycle 
(in Figure 5.8) and thus µi < µd < µn. For zero DC premagnetization and small AC voltages (currents) at

standstill, for example, µi ≈ 100–150 µ0 which explains why the magnetization inductances correspond 
to lmd

Interpolation through tables or analytical curve fitting may be applied to produce easy-to-use expres-
sions for digital simulations.
The single unique d–q magnetization curves model include the cross-coupling implicitly in the expres-
sions of Ψdm, Ψqm, but it considers it explicitly in the dΨdm/dt and dΨqm/dt expressions, that is, in the transients. 
Either with currents Idm, Iqm, If, ID, IQ, ωr, θer or with flux linkages Ψdm, Ψqm, Ψf, ΨD, ΨQ, ωr, θer (or with quite a 
few intermediary current, flux–linkage combinations) as variables, models based on same concepts may be 
developed and used rather handily both for the study of steady states and for transients [5]. The computation 
of Y

This tempting simplicity is payed for by the limitation that the unique d–q magnetization curves 
concept does not seem to hold when the machine is notably underexcited, with the emf lower than the 
terminal voltage, because the saturation level is smaller despite the fact that Im is about the same as for 
lagging power factor at constant voltage [4].
This limitation justifies the search for a more general model valid for the whole range of active 
(­reactive) power capability envelope of the SG.
We call this the “multiple magnetization curve model.”

Now ldm, lqm are functions of both Idm and Iqm. Conversely Ψdms(Idm, Iqm) and Ψqms(Idm, Iqm) are two families 
of magnetization curves that have to be found either by computation or by experiments.
For steady state ID = IQ = 0, but otherwise Equations 5.95 hold as they are. Basically, the Ψdms and Ψqms 
curves look like the ones shown Figure 5.10.

Once this family of curves is acquired (by FE analysis or by experiments), various analytical approxima-
tions may be used to curve-fit them adequately.
Then, with Ψd, Ψq, Ψf, ΨD, ΨQ, ωr, θer as variables and If, ID, IQ, Id, Iq as dummy variables, the Ψdms(Idm, Iqm), 
Ψqms(Idm, Iqm) functions are used in Equation 5.95 to calculate iteratively each time step, the dummy 
variables.
When using flux linkages as variables no additional inductances, responsible for cross-coupling 
magnetic saturation, need consideration. As they are not constant, their introduction does not seem 
very practical. However, such attempts keep reoccurring [6,7] as the problem seems far from a defini-
tive solution.

Considering cross-coupling due to magnetic saturation seems necessary when calculating the field cur-
rent, stator current, and power angle, under steady state for given active, reactive power and voltage, with an 
error less than 2% for the currents and around an 1° error for the power angle [4,7]. Also, during large distur-
bance transients, where the main flux varies notably, the cross-coupling saturation effect is to be considered.
Though magnetic saturation is very important for refined steady state and for transients investiga-
tions, most of the theory of transients for the control SGs is developed for constant parameter condi-
tions; operational parameters is such a case.
5.8  Operational Parameters
In the absence of magnetic saturation variation, the general equivalent circuits of SG—Figure 5.6—lead 
to the following generic expressions of operational parameters in the Ψd and Ψq operational expressions:

As already mentioned, with ωb in rad/s, the time constants are all in seconds, while all resistances and 
inductances are in P.U. values.
The time constants differ between each other up to more 100–1 ratios. ¢
Td0 is of the order of seconds in 
large SGs, while ¢
Td, ¢¢
Td0, and ¢¢
Tq0 are in the order of a few tenth of a second, ¢¢
Td , ¢¢
Tq  in the order of a few tens 
of milliseconds and TD is a few milliseconds.
Such a broad spectrum of time constants indicates that the SG equations for transients Equation 5.82 
represent a stiff system. Consequently, the solution through numerical methods needs time integration 
steps smaller than the lowest time constant, in order to portray correctly all occurring transients. The 
time constants are catalog data for SGs:
•	
¢
Td0—d axis open circuit field-winding (transient) time constant (Id = 0, ID = 0)
•	
¢¢
Td0—d axis open circuit damper-winding (subtransient) time constant (Id = 0)
•	
¢
Td—d axis transient time constant (ID = 0)—field-winding time constant with short-circuited sta-
tor but with open damper winding
•	
¢¢
Td —d axis subtransient time constant—damper-winding time constant with short-circuited field 
winding and stator
•	
¢¢
Tq0—q axis open circuit damper-winding (subtransient) time constant (Iq = 0)
•	
¢¢
Tq —q axis subtransient time constant (q axis damper-winding time constant with short-circuited 
stator)
•	 TD—d axis damper-winding self-leakage time constant
In the industrial practice of SGs the limit—initial and final—values of operational inductances have 
become catalog data:

where
¢¢ld, ¢ld, and ld are d-axis subtransient, transient, and synchronous inductances
¢¢lq and lq are q-axis subtransient, transient, and synchronous inductances
Typical values of the time constants (in seconds) and subtransient and transient and synchronous 
inductances (in P.U.) are shown in Table 5.1.
As Table 5.1 suggests, various inductances and time constants that characterize the SG are constants. 
In reality, they depend on magnetic saturation and skin effects (in solid rotors) as suggested in previous 
paragraphs. There are, however, transient regimes where the magnetic saturation stays practically the 
same as it corresponds to small disturbance transients.
On the other hand, in high-frequency transients, the ld, lq variation with magnetic saturation level 
is less important, while the leakage flux paths saturation becomes notable for large values of stator and 
rotor current (the beginning of a sudden short-circuit transient).

216
Synchronous Generators
To make the treatment of transients easier to approach, we distinguish here a few types of transients:
•	 Fast (electromagnetic) transients: speed is constant
•	 Electromechanical transients: electromagnetic + mechanical transients (speed also varies)
•	 Slow (mechanical) transients: electromagnetic steady state; speed varies
In what follows, we will treat each of these transients in some detail.
5.8.1  Electromagnetic Transients
In fast (electromagnetic) transients, the speed may be considered constant and thus the equation of 
motion is ignored.
The stator voltage equations of Equation 5.82 in Laplace form with Equation 5.97 become thus:

However, there are a few particular operation modes where their pursuit is important. The sudden 
three-phase short circuit from no-load and the step voltage or AC operation at standstill are considered 
here. For start, the voltage build-up at no-load, in the absence of a damper winding, is treated.
Example 5.2:  The Voltage Build Up at No Load
Let us apply Equation 5.102 for the stator voltage build-up at no load in an SG without a damper 
cage on the rotor when the 100% step DC voltage is applied to the field winding.

In a similar way, vB(t) and vC(t) are obtained using Park inverse transformation.
The stator symmetrical phase voltages may be expressed simply in volts by multiplying the 
voltages in P.U. to the base voltage Vb = Vn × sqrt(2); Vn is the base RMS phase voltage.
5.8.2  Sudden Three-Phase Short Circuit from No Load

age is constant:

Therefore, already for the initial conditions, the voltage along axis d, vd0, is zero under no load. For axis 
q, the no-load voltage occurs. To short-circuit the machine, we simply have to apply along axis q the 
opposite voltage –vq0.
It should be noted that, as vf = vf0, vf(s) = 0, Equation 5.102 becomes

Td , ¢¢
Td0, Ts, ra < slq(s)/ωb) have been proven 
to yield correct results in stator current waveform during unsaturated short circuit—with given unsatu-
rated values of inductance and time constant terms—within an error below 10%.
It may be argued that this is a notable error; but at the same time, it should be noted that instrumenta-
tion errors are within this range.
The use of expressions Equations 5.121 and 5.123 to estimate the various inductances and time con-
stants, based on measured stator and field currents transients during a provoked short circuit at lower 
than rated no-load voltage, is included in both ANSI and IEC standards. Traditionally, graphoanalytical 
methods of curve fitting have been used to estimate the parameters from the sudden three-phase short 
circuit.
With today’s available computing power, various nonlinear programming approaches to the SG 
parameter estimation from short-circuit current versus time curve have been proposed [8,9].
Despite notable progress along this path, there are still uncertainties and notable errors as the mag-
netic saturation of both leakage and main flux paths is present and varies during the short-circuit tran-
sients. The speed also varies in many cases during the short circuit, while the model assumes it constant. 
To avoid the zero-sequence currents due to nonsimultaneous phase short circuit, ungrounded three-
phase short circuit should be performed.
Moreover, additional damper cage circuits are to be added for solid-rotor pole SGs (turbogenerators) 
to account for frequency (skin) effects.
Sub-subtransient circuits and parameters are introduced to model these effects.
For most large SGs, the sudden three-phase short-circuit test, be it at lower no-load voltage and (or) 
speed, may be performed only at the user’s site, during commissioning, using the turbine as controlled 
speed prime mover. This way, the speed during the short circuit may be kept constant.

5.9  Standstill Time-Domain Response Provoked Transients
Flux (current) raise or decay tests may be performed at standstill, with the rotor aligned to axis d and q 
or for any given rotor position, in order to extract, by curve fitting, the stator-current and field currents 
time response for the appropriate SG model [10]. Any voltage versus time signal may be applied, but the 
frequency response standstill tests have become recently worldwide accepted. All these standstill tests 
are purely electromagnetic tests as the speed is kept constant (zero in this case).
The situation in Figure 5.12a corresponds to axis d, while Figure 5.12b refers to axis q.

The standstill time-domain transients may be explored by investigating both the current rise for step 
voltage application or current decay when the stator is short circuited through the freewheeling diode, 
after the stator was disconnected from the power source.
For current decay, the left-hand side of Equations 5.129 and 5.130 should express only −2/3 VDiode 
in axis d and −1/sqrt(3) Vdiode in axis q. The diode voltage Vdiode(+) should be acquired through proper 
instrumentation.

With approximations similar to the case of sudden short-circuit transients expressions of Id(t), If(t) are 
obtained. They are simpler as no interference from axis q occurs.
In a more general case, where additional damper circuits are included to account for skin effects 
in solid rotor SG, the identification process of parameters from step voltage responses becomes more 
involved. Nonlinear programming methods such as the least squared error, maximum likelihood, and 
the more recent evolutionary methods such as genetic algorithms could be used to identify separately 
the d and q inductances and time constants from standstill time-domain responses.
The starting point of all such “curve fitting” methods is the fact that the stator current response 
contains a constant component and a few aperiodic components with time constant close 
to ¢¢
Td , ¢
Td, and Tad:

Curve fitting the measured Id(t) and Iq(t), respectively, with the calculated ones based on Equations 5.134 
yields the time constants and ¢¢¢ld , ¢¢ld, ¢ld, ¢¢¢lq , ¢¢lq, ¢lq. The main problem with step voltage standstill tests is that 
they do not excite properly all “frequencies”—time constants—of the machine.

A random cyclic PWM voltage excitation at standstill seems more adequate for parameter identifi-
cation [11–13]. Also, for more coherency, care must be exercised to set initial (unique) values for stator 
leakage inductance lsl and for the rotor to stator reduction ratio Kf:
	
K I
I
f

r
f
=
	
(5.135)
In reality, I f
r(t) is acquired and processed and not If(t). Finally, it is more and more often suggested, for 
practicality, to excite (with a random cyclic PWM voltage) the field winding with short circuited and 
opened stator windings rather than the stator, at standstill, because higher saturation levels (up to 25%) 
may be obtained without machine overheating.
Evidently, such tests are feasible only in axis d (Figure 5.13).
Again Id = IA, Vd = Vq = 0, Iq = 0. Therefore, from Equation 5.102 with Iq = 0 and Vd(s) = 0, Vq(s) = 0:

To eliminate hysteresis effects (with Vf(t) made from constant height pulses with randomly large timings 
and zeroes) and reach pertinent frequencies, Vf(t) may change polarity cyclically.
The main advantage of standstill time response tests (SSTRs) consists in the fact that testing time is 
rather short.

5.10  Standstill Frequency Response
Another provoked electromagnetic phenomenon at zero speed that is being used to identify the SG 
parameters (inductances and time constants) is the standstill frequency response (SSFR). The SG is sup-
plied in axis d and q respectively, through a single-phase AC voltage applied to the stator (with the field 
winding short circuited), or to the field winding (with the stator short circuited). The frequency of the 
applied voltage is varied in general from 0.001 Hz to more than 100 Hz, while the voltage is adapted to 
keep the AC current small enough (below 5% of rated value) to avoid winding overheating. The whole 
process of raising frequency level may be mechanized, but still considerable testing time is required. The 
arrangement is identical to that in Figures 5.12 and 5.13, but now s = jω, with ω in rad/s.

Complex number definitions have been used as a single-frequency voltage is applied at any time.
The frequency range is large enough to encompass whole spectrum of electrical time constants that 
spreads from a few milliseconds to a few seconds.
When the SSFR tests are performed on the field winding (with the stator short circuited—Figure 5.13), 
the response in IA and If is adapted from Equation 5.136 with s = jω:

The general equivalent circuits emanate ld(jω), lq(jω), g(jω). For the standard case, equivalent circuits of 
Figure 5.6 and Equations 5.97 and 5.98 are used.
For a better representation of frequency (skin) effects, more damper circuits are added along axis d 
(one in general) and along axis q (two in general) (Figure 5.14).
The leakage coupling inductance lfDl between the field winding and the damper windings also called 
Canay’s inductance [14], though small in general (less than stator leakage inductance), proved to be 
necessary to simultaneously fit the stator current and the field current frequency responses in axis d. 
Adding even one more such a leakage coupling inductance (say between the two damper circuits in d 
axis) failed so far to produce improved results but hampered the convergence of the nonlinear program-
ming estimation method used to identify the SG parameters [15].

227
Synchronous Generators
The main argument in favor of lfDl ≠ 0 should be its real physical meaning (Figure 5.15).
A myriad of mathematical methods have been proposed recently to identify the SG parameters from 
SSFR with mean squared error [16] and maximum likelihood [17] as some of the most frequent. A rather 
detailed description of such methods is presented in Chapter 8.

These currents interact with the stator field to produce an asynchronous torque tas as in an induction 
machine. For S > 0, the torque is motoring while for S < 0 it is generating.
As the rotor magnetic and electric circuits are not fully symmetric, there will be also asynchronous torque 
pulsations even with ωr ≠ ω1 = const. Also, the average synchronous torque teav is zero as long as ωr ≠ ω1.
The d–q model can be used directly to handle transients at a speed ωr ≠ ω1. Here, we use the dq model 
to calculate the average asynchronous torque and currents considering that the power source that sup-
plies the field winding has a zero internal impedance. That is, the field winding is short circuited for 
asynchronous (AC) currents.

The torque is positive when generating (opposite to the direction of motion). This happens only for 
S < 0 (ωr > ω1).
There is a pulsation in the asynchronous torque due to magnetic anisotropy and rotor circuit 
asymmetry.
Its frequency is (2Sω1ωb) in rad/s.

The 2Sω1 P.U. component (pulsation) in tas is thus physically evident from Equation 5.151. This pulsation 
may run as high as 50% in P.U. The average torque tasav (P.U.) for an SG with the data: V = 1, lsl = 0.15, 
ldm = 1.0, lfl = 0.3, lDl = 0.2, lqm = 0.6, lQl = 0.12, rs = 0.012, rD = 0.03, rQ = 0.04, rf = 0.03, Vf = 0 is shown in 
Figure 5.16.
A few remarks are in order:
•	 The average asynchronous torque may equal or surpass the base torque. As the currents are very 
large, the machine should not be allowed to work asynchronously for more than 2 min, in general, 
in order to avoid severe overheating. Also, the SG draws reactive power from the power system 
while it delivers active power.

•	 The torque shows a small inflexion around S = 1/2 when rs ≠ 0. This is not present for rs ≈ 0.
•	 With no additional resistance in the field winding (rft = rf), no inflexion in torque—speed curve 
around S = 1/2 occurs. The average torque is smaller also in comparison with the case of rft = 10 rf 
(additional resistance in the field winding is included).

The first term in Equation 5.155 represents the average torque, while the last two terms refer to the 
pulsating torque. As expected, for a completely symmetric rotor (as that of an induction machine) 
the pulsating asynchronous torque is zero because |ld| = |lq|, |Ψd| = |Ψq| for all slip (speed values).

Form motoring (S > 0), φd, φq < 90° and for generating (S < 0), 90° < φd, φq < 180°. For small

Example 5.4:  DC Field—Current-Produced Asynchronous Stator Losses
The DC current in the field winding, if any, produces additional losses in the stator windings 
through currents at a frequency equal to speed ω′ = ω1(1−S)(P.U.) Calculate these losses and their 
torque.
Solution
In rotor coordinates, these stator dq currents ¢Id, ¢Iq are DC, at constant speed; to calculate them 
separately, only the motion-induced voltages are considered, with ¢
Vd = ¢
Vq= 0 (the stator is short 
circuited, a sign that the power system has a zero internal impedance).

5.11  Simplified Models for Power System Studies
The P.U. system of SG Equation 5.68 describes rather completely the standard machine for any tran-
sients. The complexity of such a model makes it less practical for power system stability studies where 
tens or hundreds of SGs and consumers are involved and have to be modeled. Simplifications in the SG 
model are required for such a purpose. Some of them are discussed later, while much more is available 
in the literature on power systems stability and control [1,17].
5.11.1  Neglecting the Stator Flux Transients
When neglecting the stator transients in the dq model, it means to make (∂Ψd)/∂t = (∂Ψq)/∂t = 0.
It has been demonstrated that it is necessary also to simultaneously consider—only in the stator volt-
age equations—constant (synchronous) speed:

The flux–current relationships are the same as in Equation 5.68. The state variables may be Id, Iq, Ψf, ΨD, 
ΨQ, ωr, θer. Id and Iq are calculated from the, now algebraic, equations of stator. The system order has been 
reduced by two units.

Synchronous Generators
As expected, fast 50 (60) Hz frequency transients, occurring in Id, Iq, te, are eliminated. Only the 
“average” transient torque is “visible.” Allowing for constant (synchronous) speed in the stator equa-
tions with (∂Ψd)/∂t = ∂Ψq/∂t = 0 counteracts the effects of such an approximation at least for small signal 
transients, in terms of speed and angle response [17]. Neglecting of stator transients leads to steady-state 
stator voltage equations. Consequently, if the power network transients are neglected, the connection of 
the SG model to the power network model is rather simple with steady state all over.
A drastic computation time saving is thus obtained in power system stability studies.
5.11.2  Neglecting the Stator Transients and the 
Rotor Damper-Winding Effects
This time, in addition, the damper-winding currents are zero ID = IQ = 0 and thus:

The order of the system has been further reduced by two units. Additional computation time saving is 
obtained, with only one electrical transient left—the one produced by the field winding. The model is 
adequate for slow transients (seconds and more).

This time we start again with initial values of variables: Id0, Iq0, If0, ωr = ωr0, δV0(θer0) and of Vd0, Vq0, 
te0 = tshaft0.
Therefore, the machine is under steady state electromagnetically, while making use of motion equation 
to handle mechanical transients. In very slow transients (tens of seconds), such a model is appropriate.
Note:  A plethora of constant flux approximate models (with or without rotor damper cage), in use for 
power system studies [1,17], are not followed here [17].
Amongst the simplified models, we do illustrate here only the “mechanical” model as it helps explain-
ing SG self-synchronization, step shaft torque response and SG oscillations (free and forced).
5.12  Mechanical Transients
When the prime-mover torque varies in a nonperiodical or periodical fashion, the large inertia of the SG 
leads to a rather slow speed (power angle δV) response. To illustrate such a response, the electromagnetic 
transients may be altogether neglected as suggested by the “mechanical model” presented in the previ-
ous paragraph.
As the speed varies, an asynchronous torque tas occurs, besides the synchronous torque. The motion 
equation becomes (in P.U.)

The power angle and speed response for step shaft torque is shown qualitatively in Figure 5.17.
Note that ω0 (Equation 5.173) is traditionally known as the eigen mechanical frequency of the SG. 
Unfortunately, ω0 varies with power angle δV, field current If0 and with inertia. It decreases with increas-
ing δV and increases with increasing If0.
In general, f0 = ω0/2π varies from less or about 1 Hz to a few Hertz for large and, respectively, medium-
power SGs.
5.12.2  Forced Oscillations
Shaft torque oscillations may occur due to various reasons. The Diesel engine prime movers are a typical 
case as their torque varies with rotor position.

Let us consider first an autonomous SG without any asynchronous torque at all (Kas = 0). This is the 
ideal case of free oscillations.

The amplitude of this free oscillation (for harmonic υ) is thus inversely proportional to inertia and to the 
frequency of oscillation squared.
For the SG with rotor damper cage and connected to the power system, both Kas and teso (synchroniz-
ing torque) are nonzero and thus Equation 5.169 has to be solved as it is:

Typical variations of Kmν with ω0/Ων ratio for various Kdν values are given in Figure 5.17.
The resonance conditions for ω0 = Ων are evident. To reduce the amplification effect, Kdν 
is increased, but this is feasible only up to a point by enforcing the damper cage (more copper). 
Therefore, in general, for all shaft torque frequencies Ων, it is appropriate to fall outside the hatched 
region in Figure 5.18:

As ω0 is the eigen mechanical frequency of Equation 5.173—varies with load (δV) and with field current 
for a given machine, condition of Equation 5.184 is not so easy to fulfill for all shaft torque pulsations. 
The elasticity of shafts and of mechanical couplings between them in an SG set is a source of additional 
oscillations to be considered for the constraint in Equation 5.184. The case of the autonomous SG with 
damper cage rotor requires a separate treatment, which is beyond our scope here.

5.13  Small Disturbance Electromechanical Transients
After the investigation of fast (constant speed)—electromagnetic and, respectively, slow (mechan-
ical) transients, we return to the general case when both electrical and mechanical transients are 
to be considered.
Electric power load variations are typically causing such complex transients.
For multiple SGs and loads, power systems and voltage and frequency control system design the 
investigation of transients is generally based on small disturbance theories to capitalize on linear con-
trol systems theoretical heritage and also reduce digital simulation time.
In essence, the complete (or approximate) dq model of Equation 5.68 of the SG is linearized about a 
chosen initial steady-state point by using only the first Taylor’s series component. The linearized system 
is written in the state space form:

 is the state variables vector
ΔV is the input vector

The voltage or (and) speed controller systems may be included in Equation 5.185, and thus the small 
disturbance stability of the controlled generator is investigated by the eigenvalues method:

(5.186)
I is unity diagonal matrix.
The eigenvalues λ may be real or complex numbers.
For system stability to small disturbances, all eigenvalues should have a NEGATIVE real part.

ity performance of an SG.
The choice of Idm and Iqm as variables, instead of rotor damper cage currents ID and IQ, makes [L] 
more sparse and leaves way to somehow consider magnetic saturation. At least for steady state when the 
dependences of ldm and lqm on both Idm and Iqm (Figure 5.10) may be in advance established by tests or by 
finite element calculations.
This is easy to apply as values of Idm0 and Iqm0 are straightforward:

and the level of saturation may be considered “frozen” at the initial conditions (uninfluenced by small 
perturbations). Typical critical eigenvalues change with active power for the Is, If, Im model above are 
shown in Figure 5.19 [18].
It is possible to choose the variable vector in different ways by combining various flux linkages 
and current as variables [18]. Not much to gain with such choices unless magnetic saturation is not 
rigurously considered. It has been shown that care must be exercised in representing magnetic satu-
ration by single magnetization curves (dependent on I

of SG when large errors may occur. Only using complete Idm(Ψdm, Ψqm), Iqm(Ψdm, Ψqm) families of 
saturation curves will lead to good results throughout the whole active and reactive power capability 
region of the SG.
As during small perturbation transients the initial steady-state level is paramount, we leave out the 
transient saturation influence here, to consider it in the study of large disturbance transients when the 
latter really matters notably.
5.14  Large Disturbance Transients Modeling
Large disturbance transients modeling of single SG should take into account both magnetic saturation 
and frequency (skin rotor) effects.
Completing the dq model, with two d axis damper circuits and three q-axis damper circuits, satisfies 
such standards, if magnetic saturation is included, even separately, along each axis (Figure 5.20).

The magnetization curve families in Equation 5.197 have to be obtained either through SSTR or through

Therefore, the leakage inductances of stator and field winding in the equivalent circuit are replaced by their 
transient value lslt, lflt. However, in the flux–current relationship their steady-state values lsl, lfl occur. They are 
all functions of their respective currents. It should be mentioned that only for currents in excess of 2 P.U., 
leakage saturation influence is worth considering. Sudden short circuit represents such a transient process.
Equation 5.198 suggest that a cross-coupling between the equivalent circuits of axes d and q is 
required. This is rather simple to operate (Figure 5.21).
From the reciprocity condition, ldqm = lqdm.
The rather general equivalent circuit may be identified:
•	 The magnetization curve family of Equation 5.197, Equation 5.198 and leakage inductance func-
tions lsl(Is), lfl(If) are first determined from time domain standstill tests (or FEM).
•	 From frequency response at standstill or through FEM, all the other components are calculated.
The dependence of ldm and lqm of both Idm and Iqm should lead to model suitability in all magnetization 
conditions, including the disputed case of underexcited SG when the concept ldm(Im), ldm(Im) unique 
functions or of total magnetization current (mmf) fails [4].
The machine equations are straightforward from the equivalent scheme and thus are not repeated 
here. The choice of variables is as in the paragraph on small perturbations.
Tedious FEM, tests, and their processing are all required before such a rather complete circuit model 
of the SG is established in all rigor.

That the dq model may be used to investigate various symmetrical transients is very clear. The same 
model may be used in asymmetrical stator connections also, as long as the time functions of Vd and 
Vq may be obtained. But vd(t) and vq(t) may be defined only if VA(t), VB(t), VC(t) functions are available. 
Alternatively, the load voltage-current relationships have to be amenable to state space form.
Let us illustrate this idea with a few examples.

5.15  Finite Element SG Modeling
The numerical methods for field distribution calculation in electric machines are by now an established 
field with a rather long history even before 1975 when finite difference methods prevailed.
Since then, the finite element (integral) methods took over to produce revolutionary results ever since.
For the basics of finite element method, see Reference [19]. In 1976, SG time-domain responses at 
standstill have been approached successfully by FEM, making use of the conductivity matrices concept 
[20]. In 1980, the SG sudden three-phase short circuit has been calculated [21,22] by FEM.
The relative motion between stator and rotor during balanced and unbalanced short-circuit ­transients 
has been reported in 1987 [23].
In 1990s, the time stepping and coupled-field and circuit concepts have been successfully introduced 
[24] to eliminate circuit simulation restrictions based in conductivity matrices representations. Typical 
results related to no-load and steady-state short-circuit curves obtained through FEM for a 150 MVA 
13.8 kV SG are shown in Figure 5.24, after [4].
Also for steady state, FE have been proved to predict correctly (within 1%–2%) the field current 
required for various active and reactive power loads over the whole P–Q capability curve of same SG [4].
Finally, the rotor angle during steady state has been predicted within 2 degrees for the whole spec-
trum of active and reactive power loads (Figure 5.25) [4].

The FEM has also been successful in calculating SG response to standstill time domain and frequency 
responses, then used to identify the general equivalent circuit elements [25–27].
A complete picture of FE flux paths during an ongoing sudden short-circuit process is shown in 
Figure 5.26 [23].
The traveling field is visible. And so is the fact that quite a lot of flux paths cross the slots, as expected.
Finally, FE simulation of an 120 MW, 13.8 kV, 50 Hz SG on load during and after a three-phase fault 
has been successfully done [28] Figure 5.27.

This is a severe transient as the power angle reaches over 90° during the transients when notable active 
power is delivered as the field current is also large. The plateau in the line voltage recovery from 0.4 to 
0.5 s (Figure 5.27d, e, and c) is this way explainable.
It is almost evident that FEM has reached the point of being able to simulate virtually any operation 
mode in an SG. The only question is the amount of computation time required, not to mention the 
extraordinary expertise involved in wisely using it.
The FEM is the way of the future in SG, but there may be two avenues to that future:
)>>
1.)>> Use FEM to calculate and store SG lumped parameters for an ever wider saturation and frequency 
effects and then use the general equivalent circuits for the study of various transients with the 
machine alone or incorporated in a power system [30,31].
)>>
2.)>> Use FEM directly to calculate the electromagnetic and mechanical transients through coupled-
field circuit models or even directly through powers, torques, and motion equations [32–35].
While the first avenue looks more practical for power system studies, the second one may be used for the 
design refinements of a new SG.
The few existing dedicated FEM software packages are expected to improve further, at reasonably 
additional computation time and costs.

5.16  SG Transient Modeling for Control Design
In Section 5.10, simplified models for power system studies have been described. One specific approxi-
mation has gained wide acceptance, especially for SG control design.
It is related to neglecting of stator transients with neglecting the damper-winding effects altogether 
(third-order model) or with considering one damper winding along axis q but no damper winding along 
axis d (fourth-order model) [29].

As expected, in the absence of the rotor q axis damping winding, ¢ed is taken as zero and the third order 
of the model is restored. ¢xd and ¢xq are the transient reactances (in P.U.) as defined earlier in this chapter. 
The two equations of motion in Equation 5.203, Equations 5.207 and 5.208, have to be added to form the 
fourth order (transient model) of the SG.
As the transient emf ¢eq differential equation includes the field-winding voltage vf, the application of 
this model to control is greatly facilitated as shown in Chapter 6, dedicated to the control of SG.
The initial values of transients emfs ¢ed, ¢eq are calculated from stator equations in Equations 5.205 and

In a similar way, a subtransient model may be defined for the first moments after a fast transient pro-
cess [2]. Such a model is not suitable for control design purposes where the excitation current control is 
rather slow anyway.
Linearization of the transient model with the rotor speed ωr as variable (even in the stator equations) 
proves to be very useful in automatic voltage regulator (AVR) design as shown in Chapter 6.
5.17  Summary
•	 SGs undergo transient operation modes when the currents, flux linkages, voltages, load, or speed 
vary with time [29]. Connection of the SGs to a power system, electrical load, or shaft torque 
variations produce transients. The steady-state, two reaction, model in Chapter 4, based on travel-
ing fields at standstill to each other, is valid only for steady-state operation.
	
	   The main SG models for transients are as follows:
•	 The phase-variable circuit model
•	 The orthogonal axis dq circuit model
•	 The coupled FEM field/circuit model
–	 The phase-variable model is based on the SG structure as multiple electric and magnetic 
circuits coupled together electrically and (or) magnetically. The stator/rotor circuits 
mutual inductances always depend on rotor position. In salient-pole rotors, the stator 
phase self-inductances vary also with rotor position, that is with time. With one damper 
circuit along each rotor axis, a field winding and three stator phases, an eight-order 
nonlinear system with time-variable coefficients is obtained, when the two equations of 
motion are added. The basic variables are IA, IB, IC, If, ID, IQ, ωr, and θr.
–	 Solving a variable coefficient state space system requires the inverting of a time-variable 
sixth-order matrix for each integration step time interval. Only numerical methods such 
as Runge–Kutta–Gill, predictor–corrector can handle the solving of such a stiff state—
space high-order system. In addition, the computation time is prohibitive due to the time 
dependence of inductances. Finally, the complexity of the model leaves little room for 
intuitive interpretation of phenomena and trends for various transients. And it is unprac-
tical for control design. In conclusion, the phase-variable model should be used only for 
special situations such as highly unbalanced transients or faults, etc.
–	 Simpler models are needed to handle transients in a more practical manner.
–	 The orthogonal axis (dq) model is characterized by inductances between windings that are 
independent from rotor position. The dq model may be derived from the phase-variable

model either through a mathematical change of variables (Park transform) or through a 
physical orthogonal axis model.

	 The physical dq model consists of a fictitious machine with same rotor f, D, Q orthogonal rotor 
windings as in the actual machine and with two stator windings whose magnetic axes (mmfs) are 
always fixed to the rotor d and q orthogonal axes. The fact that the rotor dq axes move at rotor 
speed and are always aligned to axis d and q secure the independence of the dq model inductances 
of rotor position.
•	 Steady state means d.c. in the dq model of SG.
•	 For complete equivalence of the dq model with the real machine a null component is added. This 
component does not produce torque through the fundamental and its current is determined by 
the stator resistance and leakage inductance:

•	 The dq model parameters dependence on the real machine parameters is rather simple.
•	 To reduce the number of inductances in the dq model, the rotor quantities are reduced to the sta-
tor under the assumption that the air gap main magnetic field couples all windings along axis d 
and, respectively, q. Thus the stator-rotor coupling inductances become equal to the stator mag-
netization inductances ldm, lqm.
•	 An additional leakage coupling inductance lfDl between the field winding and the d-axis damper 
winding is introduced also, as it proves useful in providing for good results both in the stator and 
field current transient responses.
•	 The dq model is in general used in the per unit (P.U.) form to reduce the range of variables 
during transients from zero to say 20 for all transients and all power ranges. The base quan-
tities, voltage, current, power are the rated ones, in general, but other choices are possible. 
In this chapter, all variables and parameters are in P.U., but the time t and inertia H are in 
seconds. In this case, d/dt →s/ωb in Laplace form (ωb—the base (rated) angular frequency 
in rad/s).
•	 The rotor-to-stator reduction coefficients conserve losses and power, as expected.

•	 The dq model equations writing assumes source circuits in the stator and sink circuits in the rotor 
and the induced voltage: e = −dΨ/dt. Also, implicitly, the Poynting vector P

 enters the 
sink circuits and exits the source circuits. This way, all flux/current relations contain only + signs. 
This choice leads to the fact that while power and torque is positive for generating, the components 
Vd, Vq, and Iq are always negative for generating. But Id is either negative or positive depending on 
the load power factor angle. This is valid for the trigonometric positive motion direction.
•	 The space-vector diagram at steady state evidentiates the power angle δV between the voltage vec-
tor and axis q in the third quadrant, with δV > 0 for generating.
•	 Based on the dq model, state-space equations in P.U. of Eqaution 5.82, two distinct general equiva-
lent circuits may be drawn (Figure 5.6). They are very intuitive in the sense that all dq model equa-
tions may be derived by inspection. The distinct d and q equivalent circuits for transients indicate 
that there is no magnetic coupling between the two orthogonal axes.
•	 In reality, in heavily saturated SGs, there is a cross-coupling due to magnetic saturation between 
the two orthogonal axes. Putting this phenomenon into the dq model has received a lot of atten-
tion lately but here only two representative solutions are described.
•	 One uses distinct but unique magnetization curves along axes d and q: Y

fail when the SG is “deep” in the leading power factor mode (underexcited, with Im < 0.7 P.U.). 
However when Im > 0.7 P.U. it has not been proved wrong yet.
•	 The second model for saturation presupposes a family of magnetization curves along axis dq, 
respectively, q: Y

of these functions, should not fail over the entire active/reactive power envelope of an SG. But it 
requires more computation efforts.
•	 The magnetization curves along axes d and q may be obtained either from experiments or through 
FEM field calculations.
•	 The cross-coupling magnetic saturation may be rather handily included in the dq general equiva-
lent circuit for both axes (Figure 5.21).
•	 The general equivalent circuits are based on the flux/stator current relationships without rotor 
currents:

•	 ld(s), lq(s), and g(s) are known as the operational parameters of the SG (s—Laplace operator).
•	 Operational parameters include the main inductances and time constants that are catalogue data 
of the SG: subtransient, transient, and synchronous inductances ¢¢ld, ¢ld, ld, along d-axis and ¢¢lq, ¢lq 
along q axis. The corresponding time constants are ¢¢
Td , ¢

Td0, ¢

•	 Though transients may be handled directly via the complete d–q model through its solving by 
numerical methods, a few approximations have led to very practical solutions.
•	 Electromagnetic transients are those that occur at constant speed. The operational calculus may 
be applied with some elegant analytical approximated solutions as a result. Sudden three-phase 
short circuit falls into this category. It is used for unsaturated parameter identification by com-
paring the measured and calculated current waveforms during a sudden short circuit. Graphical 
models (20 years ago) and advanced nonlinear programming methods have been used for curve 
fitting the theory and tests with parameter estimation as the main goal.

•)>> Electromagnetic transients may be provoked also at zero speed with the applied voltage vector 
along axis d or q with or without DC in the other axis. The applied voltage may be DC step voltage 
or PWM cyclical voltage rich in frequency content. Alternatively, single-frequency voltages may 
be applied one after the other and the impedance measured (amplitude and phase). Again, a way 
to estimate the general equivalent circuit parameters has been born through standstill electro-
magnetic transients processing. Alternatively, FEM calculations may replace or accompany the 
tests for same purpose: parameter estimation.
•)>> For multimachine transients investigation, simpler lower-order dq models have become standard. 
One of them is based on neglecting the stator (fast) transients. In this model, the fast decaying AC 
components in stator currents and torque are missing. Further on, it seems better that in the case 
the rotor speed in the stator equations be kept equal to the synchronous speed ωr = ωr0 = ω1. The 
speed in the model varies as the equation of motion remains in place.
•)>> Gradually, the damper circuits transients may be also neglected (ID = IQ = 0), and thus only one 
electrical transient, determined by the field winding, remains. With the two motion equations, 
this one makes for a third-order system. Finally, all electric transients may be neglected to be left 
only with the motion equations, for very slow (mechanical transients).
•)>> Asynchronous running at constant speed may also be tackled as an electromagnetic transient 
with s → jSω1; S—slip; S = (ω1 − ωr)/ω1. An inflexion in the asynchronous torque is detected around 
S = 1/2 (ωr = ω1/2). It tends to be small in large machines as rs is very small in P.U.
•)>> In close to synchronous speed, |S|<0.05, the asynchronous torque is proportional to slip speed Sω1. 
Also, torque pulsations occur in the asynchronous torque, they have to be accounted for during 
transients, for better precision, as asynchronous torque tas is

屴Its pulsations frequency is small because S gets smaller, as it is the case around synchronism 
(|S|<0.05, ωr ≈ (0.95−1.05)ω1).
•)>> Mechanical (very slow) transients may be treated easily with the SG at steady state electromag-
netically. Only speed ωr and power angle δv vary in the so-called rotor swing equation. Through 
numerical methods, the nonlinear model may be solved in general but, for small perturbations, 
a simple analytical solution for ωr(t) and δv(t) may be found for particular inputs such as shaft 
torque step or frequency response.
•)>> For the SG in stand-alone operation without a damper cage, a proper mechanical frequency f0 
is defined. It varies with field current If, power angle δv, and inertia, but it is in general less than 
2–3 Hz for large- and medium-power standard SGs. When an SG is connected to the power grid 
and the shaft torque presents pulsations at Ωυ, resonance conditions may occur. They are charac-
terized by severe oscillations amplification (in δv), that are tempered by a large inertia or (and) a 
strong damper cage. Torsional shaft frequencies by the prime mover shaft and coupling to the SG 
may also produce resonance mechanical conditions that have to be avoided.
•)>> Electromechanical transients are characterized by both electrical and mechanical transients. For 
small perturbations, the dq model provides a very good way to investigate the SG stability—with-
out or with voltage and speed control—by the eigenvalue method, after linearization around a 
steady state given point.
•)>> For large disturbance transients, the full dq model with magnetic saturation and frequency effects 
(Figure 5.21) is recommended. Numerical methods may solve the transients altogether, but direct 
stability methods typical to nonlinear systems may also be used.

optimization or for controller design. With the computation power of microcomputers rising by 
the year, the FEM is becoming the norm in analyzing the FEM steady-state and transient perfor-
mance: electromagnetic, thermal, or mechanical.

analytical approximations will eventually remain the norm for preliminary and optimization 
design, particular transients, and SG control.

Control of Synchronous 
Generators in Power Systems
6.1  Introduction
A satisfactory operation of an AC power system is achieved when frequency and voltage remain nearly 
constant or vary in a limited and controlled manner when active and reactive loads vary.
Active power flow is related to prime mover’s energy input and thus to the speed of speed governors 
(SGs). On the other hand, reactive power control is related to terminal voltage. Too a large electric active 
power load would lead to speed collapse, while too a large reactive power load would cause voltage collapse.
When a generator acts alone on a load, or it is by far the strongest in an area of a power system, its fre-
quency may be controlled via generator speed, to remain constant with load (isochronous control). On the 
contrary, when the SG is part of a large power system, and electric generation is shared by two or more SGs, 
the frequency (speed) cannot be controlled to remain constant because it would forbid generation sharing 
between various SGs. Control with speed droop is the solution, to allow for fair generation sharing.
Automatic generation control (AGC) distributes the generation task between SGs; and based on this 
as input, the speed control system of each SG controls its speed (frequency) with an adequate speed 
droop so that generation “desired” sharing is obtained.
By fair sharing, we mean either power delivery proportional to ratings of various SGs or based on 
some cost function optimization, such as minimum cost of energy.
Speed (frequency) control quality depends on the speed control of the SG itself, but also on the other 
“induced” influences, besides the load dependence on frequency.
In addition, torsional shafts oscillations—due to turbine shaft, couplings, generator shaft elasticity, and 
damping effects—and subsynchronous resonance (SSR) (due to transmission lines series capacitor com-
pensation to increase transmission power capacity at long distance) influence the quality of speed (active 
power) control. Measures to counteract such effects are required. Some of them are presented in this chapter.
In principle, reactive power flow of an SG may be controlled through SG output voltage control, 
which in turn is performed through excitation (current or voltage) control. SG voltage control quality 
depends on the SG parameters, excitation power source dynamics with its ceiling voltage, available 
to “forcing” the excitation current when needed in order to obtain fast voltage recovery upon reactive 
power load severe variations. The knowledge of load reactive power dependence on voltage is essential 
to voltage control system design.
Though active and reactive power control interactions are small, in principle, they may influence the 
control stability of each other.
To decouple them, power system stabilizers (PSS) have been added to the automatic voltage regulators 
(AVRs). PSSs have inputs such as speed or active power deviations and have steered lately extraordinary 
interest. In addition, various limiters—such as overexcitation (OEL) and underexcitation (UEL)—are 
required to ensure stability and avoid overheating of the SG. Load shedding and generator tripping are 
also included to match power demand to offer.

258
Synchronous Generators
In phase of the utmost complexity of SG control, with power quality as a paramount objective, SG 
models, speed governor models (Chapter 3), excitation systems and their control models, and PSSs have 
all been standardized through IEEE recommendations.
The developments of powerful DSP systems and of advanced power electronics converters with IGBTs, 
GTIs, and MCTs, together with new nonlinear control systems such as variable structure ­systems, 
fuzzy-logic-neural-networks, and self-learning systems, may lead in the near future to the integration of 
active and reactive power controls into unique digital multi-input self-learning control systems. The few 
attempts along this path so far are very encouraging.
In what follows, the basics of speed and voltage control are given while ample reference to recent solutions 
is made, with some sample results. For more on power system stability and control, References see [1–3].
In Figure 6.1, we distinguish the following components:
•)>> AGC
•)>> Automatic reactive power control (AQC)
•)>> Speed/power and the voltage/reactive power droop curves
•)>> Speed governor (Chapter 3) and the excitation system
•)>> Prime mover/turbine (Chapter 3) and SG (Chapter 5)
•)>> Speed, voltage, and current sensors
•)>> Step-up transformer, transmission line (XT), and the power system electromagnetic force (emf) Es
•)>> PSS added to the voltage controller input
In the basic SG control system, the active and reactive power control subsystems are rather independent 
with only the PSS as a “weak link” between them.
The active power reference P* is obtained through the AGC system. A speed (frequency)/power 
curve (straight line) leads to the speed reference ωr*. The speed error ωr*−ωr then enters a speed 
governor control system whose output drives the valves and, respectively, the gates of various types 
of turbine speed-governor servomotors. AGC is part of load–frequency control of the power sys-
tem that the SG is part of. In the so-called supplementary control, AGC moves the ωr/P curves for 
desired load sharing between generators. On the other hand, AQC may provide the reactive power 
­reference of the respective generator Q* <> 0.

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
A voltage/reactive power curve (straight line) will lead to voltage reference VC*. The measured voltage 
VG is augmented by an impedance voltage drop IG(RC + jXC) to obtain the compensated voltage VC. The 
voltage error VC*−VC then enters the excitation voltage control (AVR) to control the excitation voltage Vf 
in such a manner that the reference voltage VC* is dynamically maintained.
The PSS adds to the input of AVR a signal that is meant to provide a positive damping effect of AVR 
upon the speed (active power) low-frequency local pulsations.
The speed governor controller (SGC), the AVR, and the PSS may be implemented in various ways 
from PI, PID to variable structure, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANNs), µ∞, etc. Also, there 
are various built-in limiters and protection measures.
In order to design SGC, AVR, PSS, proper turbine, speed governor, and SG simplified models are 
required. As for large SGs in power systems, the speed and excitation voltage control takes place within 
a bandwidth of only 3 Hz, simplified models are really feasible.
6.2  Speed Governing Basics
Speed governing is dedicated to generator response to load changes. An isolated SG with a rigid shaft 
system and its load are considered to illustrate the speed governing concept (Figure 6.2).

For a step variation in load power (ΔPL), the final speed deviation Δωr = ΔPL/D (Figure 6.4). The simplest 
(primitive) speed governor would be an integrator of speed error that will drive the speed to its reference 
value in the presence of load torque variations. This is called the isochronous speed governor (Figure 6.5a).
The primitive (isochronous) speed governor cannot be used when more SGs are connected to a 
power system because it will not allow for load sharing. Speed droop or speed regulation is required: in 
­principle, a steady-state feedback loop in parallel with the integrator (Figure 6.6a and b) will do.
It is basically a proportional speed controller with R providing the steady-state speed versus load 
power (Figure 6.6c) straight-line dependence:

Synchronous Generators
The time response of a primitive speed-droop governor to a step load increase is characterized now by 
speed steady-state deviation (Figure 6.6d).
With two (or more) generators in parallel, the frequency will be same for all of them, and thus the load 
sharing depends on their speed-droop characteristics (Figure 6.7).

Only if the speed droop is the same (R1 = R2), the two SGs are loaded proportionally to their rating. The 
speed/load characteristic may be moved up and down by the load reference setpoint (Figure 6.8).
By moving the straight line up and down, the power delivered by the SG for given frequency goes up 
and down (Figure 6.9).
The example in Figure 6.9 is related to a 50 Hz power system. It is similar for 60 Hz power systems. 
In essence, the same SG may deliver at 50 Hz, zero power (point A), 50% (point B), and 100% power 
(point C).
In strong power systems, the load reference signal changes the power output and not its speed, as the 
latter is determined by the strong power system.
It is also to be noted that, in reality, the frequency (speed) power characteristics depart from a straight 
line but still have negative slopes, for stability reasons.
This departure is due to valve (gate) nonlinear characteristics; when the latter are linearized, the 
straight line f(P) is restored.

6.3  Time Response of Speed Governors
In Chapter 3, we have introduced models that are typical for steam reheat or nonreheat turbines (Figures 
3.9 and 3.10) and hydraulic turbines (Figure 3.40 and Equation 3.43). Here, we add them to the speed-
droop primitive governor with load reference as discussed in the previous section (Figure 6.10a and b).

Synchronous Generators
For hydraulic turbines, the speed governor has to contain transient droop compensation. This is so 
because a change in the position of the gate, at the foot of the penstock, produces first a short-term tur-
bine power change opposite to the expected one. For stable frequency response, long resetting times are 
required in standalone operation.
A typical such system is shown in Figure 6.10b.
TW—Water starting constant (typically, TW = 1 s)
Rp—Steady-state speed droop (typically, 0.05)
TGV—Main gate servomotor time constant (typically, 0.2 s)
TR—Reset time (typically, 5 s)
RT—Transient speed droop (typically, 0.4)
D—Load damping coefficient (typically, D = 2)
Typical responses of the systems in Figure 6.10a and b to a step load (ΔPL) increase are shown in 
Figure 6.11 for speed deviation Δωr (in p.u.).
As expected, the speed deviation response is rather slow for hydraulic turbines, average with reheat 
steam turbine generators and rather fast (but oscillatory) for nonreheat steam turbine generators.
The speed governor turbine models in Figure 6.10 are rather standard. More complete nonlinear 
models are closer to reality. Also nonlinear more robust SGCs are to be used to improve speed (or power 
angle) deviation response to various load perturbations (ΔPL).

6.4  Automatic Generation Control
In a power system, when load changes, all SGs contribute to the change in power generation. The res-
toration of power system frequency requires additional control action that adjusts the load reference 
set-points. Load reference set-points modification leads to automatic change of power delivered by each 
generator.
AGC has three main tasks:
	
1.	 Regulating frequency to a specified value
	
2.	 Maintaining intertie power (exchange between control areas) at scheduled values
	
3.	 Distributing the required change in power generation amongst SGs such that the operating costs 
are minimized.
The first two tasks are also called “load-frequency control.”
In an isolated power system, the function of AGC is to restore frequency as intertie power exchange 
is not present.
This function is performed by adding an integral control on the load reference settings of the speed 
governors for the SGs with AGC. This way the steady-state frequency error becomes zero. This integral 
action is slow and thus overrides the effects of composite frequency regulation characteristics of the 
isolated power system (made of all SGs in parallel). Thus the generation share of SGs that are not under 
the AGC is restored to scheduled values (Figure 6.12).
For an interconnected power system AGC is accomplished through the so-called tie-line control.
Each subsystem (area) has its own central regulator (Figure 6.13a).
The interconnected power system in Figure 6.13 is in equilibrium if for each area:
	
PGen = Pload + Ptie	
(6.10)
The intertie power exchange reference (Ptie)ref is set at a higher level of power system control, based on 
economical and safety reasons.

Synchronous Generators
The central subsystem (area) regulator has to maintain frequency at fref and the net tie-line power 
(tie-line control) from the subsystem area at a scheduled value Ptie ref.
In fact (Figure 6.13b), the tie-line control changes the power output of the turbines by varying the load 
reference (Pref) in their speed governor systems.
The area control error (ACE) is (Figure 6.13b):

ACE = -D
- l D
P

(6.11)
ACE is aggregated from tie-line power error and frequency error. The frequency error component is 
amplified by the so-called frequency bias factor λR.
The frequency bias factor is not easy to adopt as the power imbalance is not entirely represented by 
load changes in power demand but also in the tie-line power exchange.
A PI controller is applied on ACE to secure zero steady-state error. Other nonlinear (robust) regula-
tors may be used. The regulator output signal is ΔPref⁜, which is distributed over participating generators 
with participating factors α1 … αn. Some participating factors may be zero. The control signal acts upon 
load reference settings (Figure 6.12).
Intertie power exchange and participation factors are allocated based on security assessment and 
economic dispatch via a central computer.

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
AGC may be treated as a multilevel control system (Figure 6.14). The primary control level is repre-
sented by the speed governors with their load reference point. Frequency and tie-line control represent 
secondary control that forces the primary control to bring the frequency and tie-line power deviations 
to zero.
Economic dispatch with security assessment represents the tertiary control. Tertiary control is the 
slowest (minutes) of all control stages, as expected.
6.5  Time Response of Speed (Frequency) and Power Angle
Thus far, we did describe the AGC as containing three control levels in an interconnected power system.
Based on this, the response in frequency, power angle, and power of a power system to a power imbal-
ance situation may be approached. If a quantitative investigation is necessary, all the components have 
to be introduced with their mathematical models. But if a qualitative analysis is sought, then the AVRs 
are supposed to maintain constant voltage, while electromagnetic transients are neglected. Basically, the 
power system moves from a steady state to another steady-state regime, while the equation of motion 
applies to provide the response in speed and power angle.

Synchronous Generators
Power system disturbances are numerous but consumer load variation, disconnection, or connection 
of an SG from (to) the power system are representative examples.
Four time stages in the response to a power system imbalance may be distinguished:
	
1.	 Rotor swings in the SGs (the first few seconds)
	
2.	 Frequency drops (several seconds)
	
3.	 Primary control by speed governors (several seconds)
	
4.	 Secondary control by central subsystem (area) regulators (up to a minute)
During periodic rotor swings, the mechanical power of the remaining SGs may be considered constant. 
Therefore, if one generator, out of two, is shut off, the power system mechanical power is reduced twice.
The capacity of the remaining generators to deliver power to loads is reduced from

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
Due to the additional power system contribution requirement during this second stage, the genera-
tors in the power system are slow and the system frequency drops. During this stage, the share from ΔPSI 
is determined by generators, inertia. The basic element is that the power angle of the studied generator 
goes further down, while the SG is still in synchronism.
When this drop in power angle and frequency occurs, we enter the third stage when primary (SGs) 
control takes action, based on the frequency/power characteristics.
The increase in mechanical power required from each turbine is, as known, inversely proportional 
to the droop in the f(P) curve (straight line). When the disconnection of one of the two generators 
occurred, the f(P) composite curve is changing from PT− to PT+ (Figure 6.16).
The operating point moves from A to B as one generator was shut off. The load/frequency character-
istic is f(PL) in Figure 6.16. Along the trajectory BC, the SG decelerates until it hits the load curve in C, 
then accelerates up to D, and so on until it reaches the new stable point E.
The straight line characteristics f(P) will remain valid—power increases with frequency (speed) 
reduction—up to a certain power when frequency collapses. In general, if enough power (spinning) 
reserve exists in the system, the straight line characteristic holds. Spinning reserve is the difference 
between rated power and load power in the system.
Frequency collapse is illustrated in Figure 6.17.

Synchronous Generators
Because of the small spinning reserve, the frequency decreases initially so much that it intercepts the load 
curve in U, an unstable equilibrium point. Therefore, the frequency decreases steadily and finally collapses. 
To prevent frequency collapsing, load shedding is performed. At given frequency level, under­frequency 
relays in substations shut down scheduled loads in 2–3 steps in an attempt to restore frequency (Figure 6.18).
When frequency reaches point C, the first stage of load (PLI) shedding is operated. The frequency still 
decreases but at a slower rate until it reaches level D, when the second load shedding is performed. This 
time (as D is at the right side of S2), the generator accelerates and restores frequency at S2.
In the last stage of response dynamics, frequency and the tie-line power flow control through the 
AGC takes action. In islanded system AGC actually moves up stepwise the f(P) characteristics of genera-
tors such that to restore frequency at its initial value. Details on frequency dynamics in interconnected 
power systems are to be found in References [1,2].
6.6  Voltage and Reactive Power Control Basics
Dynamically maintaining constant (or controlled) voltage in a power system is a fundamental require-
ment of power quality. Passive (resistive—inductive, resistive—capacitive) loads and active loads 
(motors) require both active and reactive power flows in the power system.
While composite load power dependence on frequency is mild, the reactive load power dependency 
on voltage is very important.
Typical shapes of composite load (active and reactive power) dependence on voltage are shown in 
Figure 6.19.
As loads “require” reactive power, the power system has to provide for it.
In essence, reactive power may be provided or absorbed by
•	 Control of excitation voltage of SGs by automatic voltage regulation (AVR)
•	 Power electronics controlled capacitors and inductors by static voltage controllers: SVC, placed at 
various locations in a power system.
As voltage control is related to reactive power balance in a power system, to reduce losses due to increased 
power line currents, it is appropriate to “produce” the reactive power as close as possible to the place of 
its “utilization.” Decentralized voltage (reactive power) control should thus be favored.
As the voltage variation changes, both the active and reactive power that can be transmitted over 
a power network vary, it follows that voltage control interferes with active power (speed) control. The 
separate treatment of voltage and speed control is based on their weak coupling but also on necessity.
One way to treat this coupling is to add to the AVR the so-called PSS whose input is speed or active 
power deviation.

6.7  Automatic Voltage Regulation Concept
AVR acts upon the DC voltage Vf that supplies the excitation winding of SGs. The variation of field 
current in the SG increases or decreases the emf (no-load voltage) and thus finally, for given load, the 
generator voltage is controlled as required.
The excitation system of an SG contains the exciter and the AVR (Figure 6.20).
The exciter is in fact the power supply that delivers controlled power to SG excitation (field) 
winding.
As such, the exciters may be classified into the following:
•	 DC exciters
•	 AC exciters
•	 Static exciters (power electronics)
The DC and AC exciters contain an electric generator placed on the main (turbine—generator) shaft 
and have low power electronics control of their excitation current. The static exciters take energy from 
a separate AC source or from a step-down transformer (Figure 6.20) and convert it into DC-controlled 
power transmitted to the field winding of the SG through slip rings and brushes.
The AVR collects information on generator current and voltage (Vg, Ig) and on field current, and based 
on the voltage error controls the Vf (the voltage of the field winding) through the control voltage Vcon, 
which acts on the controlled variable in the exciter.

6.8  Exciters
As already mentioned, exciters are of three types, each with numerous embodiments in industry.
The DC exciter (Figure 6.21), still in existence for many SGs below 100 MVA per unit, consists of two 
DC comutator electric generators: the main one (main exciter or ME) and the auxiliary one (auxiliary 
exciter or AE). Both are placed on the SG main shaft. The ME supplies the SG field winding (Vf), while 
the AE supplies the ME field winding.

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
The field winding of the AE is supplied with the voltage Vcon controlled by the AVR. The power elec-
tronics source required to supply the AE field winding is of very low power ratings as the two DC com-
mutator generators provide a total power amplification ratio around 600/1 in general.
The advantage of low-power electronics external supply required for the scope is paid for by
•)>> Rather slow time response due to the large field winding time constants of the two excitation cir-
cuits plus the moderate time constants of the two armature windings
•)>> Problems with brush wearing in the ME and AE
•)>> Still all excitation power (the peak value may be 4%–5% of rated SG power) of the SG has to trans-
mitted through the slip ring brush mechanism
•)>> The flexibility of the exciter shafts and mechanical couplings adds at least one additional shaft 
torsional frequency to the turbine-generator shaft
Though still present in industry DC exciters are gradually replaced now with AC exciters or (and static 
exciters).
6.8.1  AC Exciters
AC exciters are basically making use of inside-out SGs with diode rectifiers on their rotor. As both the 
AC exciter and the SG use the same shaft, the full excitation power diode rectifier is connected directly 
to the field winding of SG (Figure 6.22). The stator-based field winding of the AC exciter is controlled 
from the AVR.
The static power converter has now a rating that is about 1/20(30) of the SG excitation winding power 
ratings as only one step of power amplification is performed through the AC exciter.
The AC exciter in Figure 6.22 is characterized by
•)>> The absence of electric brushes in the exciter and in the SG
•)>> A single machine addition on the main SG-turbine shaft
•)>> Moderate time response in Vf (SG field-winding voltage) as only one (transient) time constant 
( ¢
Td0) delays the response; the static power converter delay is small, in comparison
•)>> Addition of one torsional shaft frequency due to the flexibility of the AC exciter machine shaft and 
mechanical coupling
•)>> Small controlled power in the static power converter: (1/20 [30] of the field-winding power rating)
The brushless AC exciter (as in Figure 6.22) is used frequently in industry, even for new SGs because it 
does not need an additional sizeable power source to supply the exciter’s field winding.

6.8.2  Static Exciters
Modern electric power plants are provided with emergency power groups for auxiliary services that may 
be used to start the former from blackout. Therefore, an auxiliary power system is available in general.
This trend gave way to static exciters, mostly in the form of controlled rectifiers supplying directly the 
field winding of the SG through slip rings and brushes (Figure 6.23).
The excitation transformer is required to adapt the voltage from the auxiliary power source or from 
the SG terminals (Figure 6.23a).
It is also feasible to supply the controlled rectifier from a combined voltage (VT) and current (CT) 
transformer connected in parallel and, respectively, in series with the SG stator windings (Figure 6.23b). 
This solution provides a kind of basic AC voltage stabilization at the rectifier input terminals. This way 
short circuits or short voltage sags at SG terminals do not influence very much the excitation voltage 
ceiling produced by the controlled rectifier.
In order to cope with fast SG excitation current control, the latter has to be forced by an overvoltage 
available to be applied to the field winding. The voltage ceiling ratio (Vfmax/Vfrated) characterizes the exciter.
Power electronics (static) exciters are characterized by fast voltage response, but still the Td′ time 
constant of the SG delays the field current response. Consequently, a high-voltage ceiling is required for 
all exciters.
To exploit with minimum losses, the static exciters, two separate controlled rectifiers may be used, 
one for “steady state” and one for field forcing (Figure 6.24). There is a switch that has to be kept open 
unless the field forcing (higher voltage) rectifier has to be put to work. When Vfmax/Vfrated is notably larger 
than 2, such a solution may be considered.
The development of IGBT PWM converters up to 3 MVA per unit (for electric drives) at low voltages 
(690 VAC, line voltage) provides for new, efficient, lower volume static exciters.
The controlled thyristor rectifiers in Figure 6.24 may be replaced by diode rectifiers plus DC–DC 
IGBT converters (Figure 6.25).
A few such four quadrant DC–DC converters may be paralleled to fulfill the power level required 
for the excitation of SGs in the hundreds of MVAs per unit. The transmission of all excitation power 
through slip rings and brushes still remains a problem. However, with the today’s doubly fed induction 
generators at 400 MVA/unit, 30 MVA is transmitted to the rotor through slip rings and brushes. The 
solution is thus here for the rather lower power ratings of exciters (less than 3%–4% of SG rating).

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
The four-quadrant chopper static exciter has the following features:
•	 It produces fast current response with smaller ripple in the field winding current of the SG
•	 It can handle positive and negative field current that may occur during transients as a result of 
stator current transients
•	 The AC input currents (in front of the diode rectifier) are almost sinusoidal (with proper filtering), 
while the power factor is close to unity irrespective of load (field) current
•	 The current response is even faster than with controlled rectifiers
•	 Active front-end IGBT rectifiers may also be used for static exciters.
6.9  Exciter’s Modeling
While it is possible to derive complete models for exciters—as they are interconnected electric gen-
erators and (or) static power converters, for power system stability studies, simplified models have to 
be used.
IEEE standard 421.5 from 1992 contains “IEEE Recommended Practice for Excitation System Models 
for Power Systems.”
Moreover “Computer Models for Representation of Digital-Based Excitation Systems” have also been 
recommended by IEEE in 1996.

6.9.1  New PU System
The so-called reciprocal PU system used for the SG where the base voltage for the field winding voltage 
Vf is the SG terminal rated voltage Vn × sqrt(2) leads to PU value of Vf in the range of 0.003 or so. Such 
values are too small to handle in designing the AVR.
A new, nonreciprocal, PU system is by now widely used to handle this situation. Within this PU 
system, the base voltage for Vf is Vfb, the field winding voltage required to produce the air gap line 
(­nonsaturated) no load voltage at the generator terminals.
For the SG in PU, at no load:

Let us consider an SG with the following PU parameters: ldm = lqm = 1.6, lsl = 0.12, lfl = 0.17, 
rf = 0.006Ef.
The rated voltage V0 = 24/sqrt(3) kV, f1 = 60 Hz. The field current and voltage required to 
­produce the rated generator voltage at no load on the air gap-line are If = 1500 A, Vf = 100 V.
Calculate the following:
	 (a)	 The base values of Vf and If in the reciprocal and nonreciprocal (Vfb, Ifb) PU system
	 (b)	 The open-circuit generator transfer function ΔV0/ΔVfb
Solution
	 (a)	 Evidently, Vfb = 100 V, Ifb = 1500 A, by definition, in the nonreciprocal PU system.

6.9.2  DC Exciter Model
Let us consider the separately excited DC commutator generator exciter (Figure 6.26), with its no-load 
and on-load saturation curves at constant speed.
Due to magnetic saturation, the relationship between DC exciter field current Ief and the output volt-
age Vex is nonlinear (Figure 6.26).

278
Synchronous Generators
The air gap line slope in Figure 6.26 is Rg (as in a resistance). In the IEEE standard 451.2, the magnetic 
saturation is defined by the saturation factor Se(Vex).

Synchronous Generators
As expected, in its most simplified form, for small-signal deviations, the DC exciter is represented by 
a gain and a single time constant. Both K and T, however, vary with the operating point (Vf0).
Note: The self-excited DC exciter’s model is similar, but KE = Ref/Rg − 1 instead of KE = Ref/Rg. Also KE 
now varies with the operating point.
6.9.3  AC Exciter
The AC exciter is, in general, a synchronous generator (inside-out for brushless excitation systems). Its 
control is again through its excitation and thus, in a way, is similar to the DC exciter. If a diode rectifier 
is used at the output of the AC exciter, the output DC current If is proportional to the armature current 
as almost unity power factor operation takes place with diode rectification.
Therefore, what is additional in the AC exciter is a longitudinal demagnetizing armature reaction that 
tends to reduce the terminal voltage of the AC exciter.
Consequently, one more feedback is added to the DC exciter model (Figure 6.29) to obtain the model 
of the AC exciter.
The saturation factor SE(Vf) should now be calculated from the no-load saturation curve and the air 
gap line of the AC exciter. The armature reaction feedback coefficient Kd is related to the d-axis coupling 
inductance of the AC exciter (ldm, when the field winding of the AC exciter is reduced to its armature 
winding). It is obvious that the influence of armature resistance and damper cage (if any) are neglected 
and speed is considered constant.
It is Vex and not Vf in Figure 6.29, because a rectifier is used between the AC exciter and the SG field 
winding to change AC to DC.
The uncontrolled rectifier that is part of the AC exciter is shown in Figure 6.30.
The Vf (If) output curve of the diode rectifier is, in general, nonlinear and depends on the diode com-
mutation overlapping. The alternator reactance (inductance) xex plays a key role in the commutation 
process. Three main operation modes may be identified from no-load to short circuit [4]:

This is a steady-state characteristic. The response of the rectifier is so fast, in comparison with the 
alternator or to the SG field current response, that the steady-state characteristic suffices to model the 
rectifier.

Among the static exciter configurations, let us consider here the controlled three-phase rectifier (Figure 6.32).

The characteristic in Equation 6.42 is very similar to the first stage of the diode rectifier characteristic. The 
structural diagram is also similar (Figure 6.33). For α = 0, it degenerates into stage 1 of the diode rectifier 
case of Equation 6.37.
This time the voltage Vf applied to the field winding may be either positive or negative, while the field 
current If is always positive. Faster response in If is expected, while the control is done through the firing 
delay angle α.
The power source (a transformer in general) has a rather constant emf Vex and an internal reactance 
xex, therefore cosα is input to the rectifier and is produced as the output of the AVR.

6.10  Basic AVRs
The basic AVR has to provide closed-loop control of the SG terminal voltage by acting upon the exciter 
input with a voltage, Vcon. It may have 1, 2, 3 stabilization loops and additional inputs, besides reference 
voltage Vref of SG and its measured value with load compensation Vc:

The load compensator introduces the compensation of generator voltage variation due to load and also 
the delay TT due to the voltage sensor.
Other than that, a major field winding voltage Vf loop is introduced. The voltage regulator may be of 
many types—a lead-lag compensator, for example—with various limiters. Figure 6.34 shows the IEEE 
1992 AC1A excitation system (with AVR).

Synchronous Generators
A few remarks are in order:
•)>> The feedback loop uses ¢
Vef instead of Vex (exciter’s excitation voltage) or SG field winding Vf
•)>> A windup limited single constant block with gain KA is imposed to limit the output variable VA
•)>> VUEL is underexcitation limiter input
•)>> VOEL—is the overexcitation limiter (OEL) input
•)>> (1 + sTC)/(1 + sTB) is in fact the voltage regulator implemented as a simple lead-lag compensator
•)>> A nonwindup limiter VRmax, VRmin is applied to the exciter excitation supply voltage
The IEEE 1992-type ST1A excitation system model is shown in Figure 6.35. It represents a potential 
source controlled rectifier.
A transformer takes the power from the SG terminals and supplies the controlled rectifier. The exciter 
ceiling voltage is thus proportional to SG terminal voltage Et. The rectifier-voltage regulation is repre-
sented by KC (KC = xex in previous structural diagrams). The field current IF is limited through gain KLR 
at the current limit ILR.
Again nonwindup and windup limiters are included. And so are underexcitation (VUEL) and 
over-excitation (VOEL) limiters.
The controlled rectifier model is considered only through the nonwindup limiter VRmax, VRmin.
The IEEE 451.2 standard from 1992 contains a myriad of models for existing excitation systems. More 
are added in Reference 6.
In the same time, more sophisticated and robust AVRs are presented, proposed, and tested. In what 
follows, a case study of a digital VAR design is presented.
Example 6.2:  Digital Excitation System Design
Let us consider here a PID AVR to be used with a IEEE-1992 standard 421.5, type AC5A alterna-
tor and diode rectifier brushless exciter for turbine—SG sets of low-to-medium power (say up 
to 50 MW).
Provide a direct design method for the PID type AVR.
Solution
The IEEE-1992, type AC5A analogous excitation system model is modified to introduce the PID 
type AVR (Figure 6.36).

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
The diode rectifier voltage regulation (reduction) with load is neglected here for simplicity.
Although the AVR is to be implemented digitally, the design of the PID controller may be 
done as if it were continuous, because the sampling frequency is more than 20 times the damped 
frequency of the closed-loop system.
The transfer function of a PID controller is:

with KP—proportional gain, KI—integral gain, KD—derivative gain.
Selecting KP, KI, and KD is called controller tuning.
The AC exciter model in Figure 6.36 may be considered as a first-order model, at least for small 
deviations (Figure 6.29). The SG may also be modeled as a first-order system represented by the 
excitation time constant ¢
Td0 at constant speed, in the absence of the damper windings. Therefore, 
the AC exciter plus the SG may be modeled through a second-order transfer function G(s):

It is desirable that the closed-loop system be almost of second order. To do so, let us select a real 
negative pole s3 = c in the far left-half plane with the other two ones as complex conjugates s1, 2 = 
a ± jb. The peak overshoot and settling time represent the basis for the pole placement (a, b, c). 
In this pole placement design method, from the three equations we find three unknowns: KP, 
KI, and KD. The controller settings of KP, KI, and KD give rise to two zeroes that might be real 
or complex conjugates. The zeroes affect the transient response, and thus some trial and error

A 50 kV AR reactive load application and rejection response is shown in Figure 6.37a, while a 
step change in voltage set point is presented in Figure 6.37b [7].
The settling time varies between 0.4 and 0.6 s, while the voltage overshoot is below ±10% (20 V) [7].
6.11  Underexcitation Voltage
The input VUEL in Figure 6.34a signals the presence of the underexcitation limiter UEL.
The UEL does not interfere with the AVR under normal transient or steady-state conditions but takes 
over the AVR control under severe conditions. When the excitation level is too low, UEL boosts excita-
tion, overriding or adding to the AVR.
UEL acts to prevent loss of SG synchronism due to insufficient excitation or to prevent operation 
loading to overheating in the stator core end region of the SG, as defined in the leading reactive power 
zone of the SG capability curve (Chapter 4).
There are many causes for excitation reduction such as the following:
•	 Increases in the power system voltage may lead to reduction of SG excitation to keep the voltage 
at the SG terminals at preset level by absorbing reactive power (UEL)
•	 Faults in the AVR
•	 Inadvertent reduction of AVR setting point Vref
When underexcited, the SG absorbs more and more reactive power even when the active (turbine) power 
is maintained constant, and thus the machine stability limit in the P (δV) curve (Chapter 4) is reached or 
the SG stator core end region gets overheated.
The UEL may input the AVR either at the generator voltage setting point Vref or after the lead-lag 
compensator (through a HV gate).
Three main types of UEL models have been recommended by IEEE in 1995 [8]:
	
1.	 Circular type (Figure 6.38a)
	
2.	 Straight-line type (Figure 6.38b)
	
3.	 Multisegment type (Figure 6.38c)
A rather simple digital UEL is presented in Reference [9]—Figure 6.39 where the limit reactive 
power—from the P-Q capability curves at various voltages is tabled as a function f (P, V):

Care must be exercised to prevent UEL side effects on other limiters such as loss of excitation protection 
(LOE), PSSs, or the AVR, OEL, volt/hertz limiters, overvoltage limiters [10].
6.12  Power System Stabilizers
The field winding current flux Ψf transients may be explored rather handily by using the third-order 
model (ΔΨf, Δδ, Δωr), where the damper cage is eliminated and so are the stator transients (Chapter 4).

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
The air gap torque deviation caused by ΔΨf is now 90° ahead of power angle deviation and thus in phase 
with speed deviation Δωr.
Consequently, the field winding flux linkage deviation ΔΨf produces a positive damping torque com-
ponent. At 1 Hz ΔΨf produces both, a reduction in synchronizing torque and an increase in damping 
torque of the SG.
Moreover, as K2, K3 are positive, in general, K4 may be positive or negative [1]. With K4 < 0, the synchro-
nizing torque increasing produced by ΔΨf is accompanied by a negative torque damping component.
AVRs may introduce similar effects [1].
These two phenomena have prompted the addition of PSSs as inputs to the AVRs.
Damping the SG rotor oscillations is the main role of PSS. The most obvious input of PSS should be 
the speed deviation Δωr.
Adding motion Equation 6.1 to Equations 6.44 and 6.45, a simplified model for an AVR–PSS system 
is shown in Figure 6.40.
It is based on the small-signal third-order model of SG Equations 6.44 through 6.46 with the damper 
windings present only in the motion equation by the asynchronous (damping) torque KDΔωr.
The transfer function of the PSS would be a simple gain if the exciter and generator transfer function 
ΔTe/ΔVf were a pure gain.
In reality, this is not so and the GPSS(s) has to contain some kind of phase compensation, (phase 
lead) to produce a pure damping torque contribution. A simple such PSS transfer function is shown in 
Figure 6.41.
The frequency range of interest is 1–2 Hz, in general.
The washout component is a high-pass filter. Without washout contribution steady-state changes in 
speed would modify the voltage Vs (Tw = 1–20 s). Especially, fast-response static exciters need PSS contri-
bution to increase damping.
Temporary increase of SG excitation current can significantly improve the transient stability because 
the synchronizing power (torque) is increased.

Ceiling excitation voltage is limited to 2.5–3.0 PU in thermal power units. But fast voltage variations 
lead to degraded damping as already pointed out. The PSS can improve damping if a terminal voltage 
limiter is added also. This is true for the first positive rotor swing. But, after the first peak of the local 
swing, the excitation is allowed to decrease before the highest composite peak of the swing is passed 
by. Keeping excitation at the ceiling value would be useful until this composite swing peak is reached.
Discontinuous excitation control may be added to the PSS to keep the excitation voltage at its maxi-
mum over the entire positive swing of the rotor (around 2 s or so). This is called transient stability 
excitation control (TSEC) and is applied, together or in place of other methods such as fast valving or 
generator tripping, in order to improve power system stability. TSEC imposes smaller duty on turbine 
shaft and on steam supply of the unit.
As PSS should produce electromagnetic torque variations ΔTe in phase with speed, the measured 
speed is the obvious input to PSS. But what speed? It could be the turbine measured speed or the genera-
tor speed. Both of them are, however, affected by noise. Moreover, the torsional shaft dynamics causes 
noise that is very important and apparently difficult to filter out from the measured signal.
The search for other more adequate PSS inputs is based on the motion equation in power PU terms 
(Figure 6.3) redrawn here in slightly new denominations (Figure 6.42).
It should be noted that as Pm may not be measured, it could be estimated with ωr (estimated) and Pe 
(measured). It is practical to estimate ωr as the frequency of the generator voltage behind the transient 
reactance as it varies slowly enough. This way the speed sensor signal is not needed. Then the structural 
diagram in Figure 6.42 can be manipulated to estimate the mechanical power Pm¢ and then calculate the 
accelerating power (Figure 6.43).
With a single structure, both speed input and accelerating power input PSS may be investigated [11], 
Figure 6.44.
The speed input of PSS may be obtained with Tp = 0 and M = Tf. For Tp ≠ 0 and M = 2 H, the acceler-
ating power PSS is obtained. Accelerating power PSS are claimed to perform better than speed PSSs in

damping local system oscillations in the interval from 0.2 to 5 Hz for 220 MVA turbogenerators [11,12].
Other inputs such as the electrical power variation itself, ΔPe, or frequency may be used with good 
results [13]. A great deal of attention has attracted the optimization of PSS with solutions involving 
fuzzy-logic [13,14], linear optimal PSS [15], synthesis [16], variable structure control [17], and H∞ [18]. 
Typical effects of PSS are shown in Figure 6.45a and b [12].
The damping of electric power and speed (frequency) oscillations is evident. The excitation system 
design—including AVR and PSS—today in digital circuitry implementation is a complex enterprises, 
which is beyond our scope here. For details, see References [1,10–18].
6.13  Coordinated AVR-PSS and Speed Governor Control
Coordinated voltage and speed control of SGs requires methods of multivariable nonlinear control 
design. Basically, the SG of interest may be modeled by a third-order model (Δδ, Δωr or Δσ, ΔΨf), while 
the power system to which it is connected might be modeled by a dynamic equivalent in order to ­produce 
a reduced-order system.
Optimization control methods are to be used to allocate proper weightings to various control 
­variables participation.
A primitive such coordinated voltage and speed SG control system is shown in Figure 6.46 [19].
The weights K1–K6 are constants in Figure 6.46, but they may be adaptable.
The washout filter provides also for zero steady-state error. A digital embodiment of coordinated 
exciter-speed governor control intended for a low head Kaplan hydro turbine generator is introduced in 
References [20,21].
Given the complexity of coordinated control of SG, continually on-line trained ANN control systems 
seem adequate [20–22] for the scope. Coordinated control of SGs has a long way to go.

6.14  FACTS-Added Control of SG
FACTS stands for flexible AC transmission systems. FACTS contribute voltage and frequency control for 
enhancing power systems stability. By doing so, FACTS intervene in active and reactive power flows in 
power systems, that is between SGs and various loads supplied through transmission lines.
Traditionally, only voltage control was available through changing transformer taps or by switching 
current and adding fixed capacitors or inductors in parallel or in series.
Power electronics has changed the picture. In the early stages, PE has used back-to-back thyristors 
in series, which, line commutated, provided for high-voltage and power devices capable to change 
the voltage amplitude. The thyristor turns off only when its current goes to zero. This is a great 
limitation.
The gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor overcame this drawback. MOS-controlled thyristors (MCTs) or 
insulated-gate thyristors (IGCTs) are today the power switches of preference due to a notably larger 
switching frequency (kHz) for large voltage and power per unit. For MW range, IGBTs are used.
FACTS uses power electronics to increase the active and reactive power transmitted over power lines, 
while maintaining stability.
Integrated now in FACTS are as follows:
•	 Static VAR compensators (SVCs)
•	 Static compensators (STATCOMs)
•	 Thyristor-controlled resistors
•	 Power electronics controlled superconducting energy storage (SMES)
•	 Series compensators and SSR dampers
•	 Phase angle regulators
•	 Unified power flow controller
•	 High voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines
SVCs deliver or drain controlled reactive power according to power system mainly local needs.
SVCs make use as basic elements of thyristor controlled inductance or capacitor energy storage ele-
ments (Figure 6.47).

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
Adequate control of voltage amplitude on reactor SVCs and capacitor SVCs, connected in parallel to 
the power system (in power substations), provides for positive or negative reactive power flow and thus 
contributes to voltage control.
The presence of SVC at SG terminals or close to SG influences the reactive power control of the AVR-
PSS system. Therefore, a coordination between AVR-PSS and SVC is required [20,21]. The SVC may 
enhance the P/Q capability at SG terminals [22]—Figure 6.48.
A simplified structure of such a coordinated exciter—SVC, based on multivariable control theory, is 
shown in Figure 6.49. It uses as variables: the speed variation d
·
, terminal voltage Vt, and active power Pe [23].
A standard solution is here considered in the form of a coordinated exciter—SG control system.
The improvement in dynamic stability boundaries is notable (Figure 6.49b) as claimed in Reference [23], 
with an optimal coordinated controller. STATCOM is an advanced SVC that uses a PWM converter to 
supply a fixed capacitor. GTOs or MCTs are used and multilevel configurations are proposed. A step-
down transformer is needed (Figure 6.50).
The advanced SVC uses an advanced voltage source converter instead of a VARIAC.
It is power electronics intensive but more compact and better in power quality.
V2 may be brought in phase with V1, by adequate control. If V2 is made larger than V1 by larger PWM 
modulation indexing (more apparent capacitor), the advanced SVC acts as a capacitor at SG terminals. 
If V2 < V1 is acts as an inductor. For a transformer reactance of 0.1 PU, a ± 10% change in V2 may produce

a ± 1.00% PU change in the reactive power flow from (to) SVC. A parallel connected thyristor-controlled 
resistor is used only for transient stability improvement as it can absorb power from the generator dur-
ing positive swings preventing the loss of synchronism.
Note: With SVCs used as reactive power compensators and power factor controllers, the interference 
with the AVR–PSS controllers has to be carefully assessed as adverse effects have been reported by 
industry [24]. In essence the SG voltage supporting capability may be reduced.
Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) may also be used for energy storage and for damp-
ing power system oscillations. The high-temperature superconductors seem a potential practical solu-
tion. They allow for current density in the superconducting coil wires of 100 A/mm2. Losses and volume 
per MW h stored are reduced. And so is the cost.
SMES may be controlled to provide both active and reactive power control, with adequate power 
electronics. Four quadrant P, Q operation is feasible (Figure 6.51) as demonstrated in References [25,26].
To investigate the action of SMES, let us consider a single SG connected to the PS bus by a transmis-
sion line.

The dual converter impresses ±VSM volts on the superconducting coil. On the AC side of the converter, 
the phase angle between the voltage and current may vary from 90° when no energy is transferred from 
power system to SMES, to 0° when the SMES is fully charging, and to 180° for maximum discharge of 
SMES energy into the power system.
The SMES current ISM is not reversible but the voltage VSM is, and therefore is the converter output

The power angle δ is now considered as the angle between the no-load voltage of the SG and the voltage 
V0 of the PS bus. Essentially, the transmission line parameters rT , xT are added to SG stator parameters.
D is the damping provided by load frequency dependence and by the SG damper winding; ΔPm—
turbine power variation; ΔPe—electric power variation, ΔPSM—SMES power variation, all in PU at 
(around) base speed (frequency) ωb. The SMES also may influence the reactive power balance by the 
phase shift between converter AC voltages and currents.
It was shown that optimal multivariable control, with minimum time transition of the whole sys-
tem from state A to B as the cost function, and |Δα|<π/2 as constraint, may produce speed and voltage 
stabilization for large PS active power load perturbations or faults (short circuit) [28]. However, using 
speed variation Δωr as input, instead of optimal control, to regulate the angle Δα loop, does not provide 
satisfactory results [28]. Notable SMES energy exchange within seconds is required for the scope [28].
Besides SG better control, the SMES has also been proposed to assist AGC that deals with interarea 
power exchange control [29]. This time the input of the SMES is proportional to or ACE, see Section 6.4) 
or is produced by a separate adaptive controller. In both cases, the superconducting inductor current 
deviation (derivative) is used as negative feedback in order to provide quick restoration of ISM to the set-
point, following a change in the load demand [30,31].
The SMES appears to be a promising emerging technology, but new performance improvement and cost 
reduction are required before it will be common practice in power systems, together with other forms of 
energy storage, such as pump storage, batteries, fuel cells, and so forth. Meanwhile, the first 20 MW com-
petitive inertial storage systems have been promoted for stabilization in railroad power supplying systems.

A transmission line may be modeled as lumped capacitors in series. The line impedance may be varied 
through thyristor-controlled series capacitors (Figure 6.52).

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
The capacitor is varied by PWM short-circuiting it through antiparallel thyristors. Overvoltage pro-
tection of thyristors is imperative. Nonlinear zinc-oxide resistors with paralleled air gap is the standard 
protection for the scope.
When an additional resistance Rad is added (Figure 6.52b), an oscillation damper is built. Series com-
pensation of long heavily loaded transmission lines might produce oscillations that need attenuation.
6.14.2  Phase-Angle Regulation and Unit Power Flow Control
In-phase and quadrature voltage regulation done traditionally with tap changers in parallel-series 
transformers may be accomplished by power electronics means (FACTS), Figure 6.53.
The thyristor AC voltage tap changer (Figure 6.53a) performs the variation of ΔV through the ST 
while the unified power controller (Figure 6.53b) may vary both the amplitude and the phase of voltage 
variation ΔV.
The phase angle regulator may transmit reactive power to increase voltage V2 > V1, while the unified 
power flow controller allows the flow of both active and reactive power, thus allowing for damping elec-
tromechanical oscillations.
HVDC transmission systems contain a high-voltage high-power rectifier at the entry, a DC transmis-
sion line and an inverter at the end of it [1]. It is power electronics intensive, but it really makes the power 
transmission system much more flexible. It also interferes with other SG control systems.
As the power electronics SG control systems cost goes down, the few special (cable) or long power 
transmission lines HVDC, now in existence, will be extended in the near future as they
•)>> Increase transmitted power capability of the transmission lines
•)>> Produce additional electromechanical oscillation damping in the AC system
•)>> Improve the transient stability
•)>> Isolate system disturbances
•)>> Perform frequency control of small isolated systems (by the output inverter)
•)>> Interconnect between power systems of different frequencies (50 or 60 Hz)
•)>> Provide for active power and voltage dynamic support

Synchronous Generators
6.15  Subsynchronous Oscillations
In Chapter 3, dedicated to prime movers, we did mention the complexity of mechanical shaft, couplings, 
and of mechanical gear in relation to wind turbine generators. In essence, the turbine—generator shaft 
system consists of several masses (inertias): turbine sections, generator rotor, mechanical couplings, 
and exciter’s rotor. These masses are connected by shafts of finite rigidity (flexibility). A mechanical 
perturbation will thus produce torsional oscillations between various sections of the shaft system that 
are above 5–6 Hz but, in general, below base frequency 50(60) Hz.
Hence the term: subsynchronous oscillations.
The entire turbine—generator rotor oscillates with respect to other generators at a frequency in the 
range of 0.2–2 Hz.
Torsional oscillations may cause:
•	 Torsional interaction with various power system (or SG) controls
•	 SSR in series—capacitor—compensated power transmission lines
Torsional characteristics of hydrogenerators units do not pose such severe problems as the generator 
inertia is much larger than in turbine—generator systems whose shafts have total lengths of up to 5 m.
6.15.1  Multimass Shaft Model
The various gas or steam turbine sections such as low pressure (LP), high pressure (HP), intermediate 
pressure (IP), generator rotor, couplings, and exciter rotor (if any), are elements of a lumped mass model.
Let us consider for start only a two mass rotor (Figure 6.54).
The motion equations of the generator and LP turbine rotors are as follows:

Two more additional equations are needed for a nuclear power unit with LP1, LP2, IP, and HP sections 
with static exciter.
Example 6.3
Let us consider a 4 mass coal-fired steam turbine generator with HP, IP, LP sections and a static 
exciter with inertias: H1 = 0.946 s, H2 = 3.68 s, H3 = 0.337 s, H4 = 0.099 s.
The generator is at nominal power and 0.9 PF (Te = 0.9). The stiffness coefficients K12, K23, K34 
are K13 = 82.74 PU torque/rad, K23 = 81.91, K34 = 37.95.
Calculate the steady-state torque and angle of each shaft section if the division of powers is 
30% for HP, 40% IP, and 30% LP.
Solution
Note that the damping coefficients (due to blades and shafts materials, hysteresis, friction, etc.) 
are zero (D1 = D2 = D3 = D4 = 0). The angle by which the LP turbine section leads the generator 
rotor is Equation 6.65:

Hz
The torsional free frequencies are, in general, above (6–8) Hz, so they do not interfere, in this case, with 
the excitation, speed-governor or intertie control (below 3–5 Hz).
The PSS may interfere with the rather high (above 8 Hz) torsional frequencies as it is designed to pro-
vide pure damping (zero phase shift at system frequency fs = 1.23 Hz in our case). At 22.4 Hz, PSS may 
produce a large phase lag (well above 20°) and thus notable negative damping; hence instability.
To eliminate such a problem, the speed sensor should be placed between LP and IP sections to 
reduce torsional modes influence on speed feedback. Other possibility would be a filter with a notch at 
22.4 Hz. The terminal voltage limiter may also produce torsional instability. Adequate filter is required 
here too.
HVDC systems may, in turn, cause torsional instabilities. But it is the series capacitor compensation 
of power transmission lines that most probably interacts with the torsional dynamics.
6.16  Subsynchronous Resonance
In a typical (noncompensated) transmission system, transients (or faults) produce DC attenuated, 60(50) 
Hz and 120(100) Hz torque components (the latter, for unbalanced loads and faults). Consequently, the 
torsional frequencies originate always from these two frequencies.
Series compensation is used to bring long power lines capacity closer to their thermal rating. In 
essence, the transmission line total reactance is partially compensated by series capacitors. Let us con-
sider a simple radial system (Figure 6.55).
The presence of the capacitor eliminates the DC stator current transients, but it introduces offset AC 
currents at natural frequency ω of the LC series circuits:

Synchronous Generators
There are two situations when series compensation may cause undamped subsyncronous oscillations:
	
1.	 Self-excitation due to induction generator effect
	
2.	 Interaction with torsional oscillations
As fn < f0, the slip S in the SG is in fact negative. Consequently, with respect to stator currents at 
­frequency fn, the SG behaves like an induction generator connected to the power system.
The effective synchronous resistance of the SG at S = (fn − f0)/f0 < 0, Ras, is negative. As such, it may 
surpass the positive resistance of the transmission line. The latter becomes an LC circuit with negative 
resistance. Electrical oscillations will self-excite at large levels. A strong damper winding in the SG or an 
additional resistance in the power line would solve the problem.
The phenomenon is independent of torsional dynamics, being of purely electromechanical essence.
If the series compensation slip frequency 60(50) Hz—fn is close to one of the torsional-free frequencies 
of the turbine—generator unit, torsional oscillations are initiated. This is the SSR. Torsional oscillations 
buildup may cause shaft fatigue or turbine—generator shaft breaking. In fact, the SSR was “discovered” 
after two such disastrous events took place in 1970–1971.
Some countermeasures to SSR are as follows:
•	 Damping circuits in parallel with the series compensation capacitors (Figure 6.52b).
•	 Dynamic filters: the unit power flow controller may be considered for the scope (Figure 6.53b) 
as it can provides an additional voltage ΔV of such a phase as to compensate the SSR voltage [32].
•	 Thyristor controlled shunt reactors or capacitors (SVCs).
•	 Selected frequency damping in the exciter control [33].
•	 Superconducting magnetic storage systems. The ability of the SMES to quickly inject or extract 
from the system active and (or) reactive power by request makes it a very strong candidate to SSR 
attenuation. About 1 s attenuation time is claimed in Reference 34.
•	 Protective relays that trip the unit when SSR is detected in speed by generator current feedback 
sensors.
6.17  Note on Autonomous Synchronous Generators’ Control
Autonomous synchronous generators are present in on-ground and on board of vehicles local power 
systems.
In general, they are driven at rather constant speed irrespective of load and procure rather constant 
output a.c. voltages amplitude and frequency (50(60) Hz or 400 Hz in avionics).
However, to reduce fuel consumption and pollution variable speed primary movers (with power 
increasing with speed) are used to drive synchronous generators in vehicular an on-ground (cogenera-
tion) applications.
In lower cost systems, variable frequency constant amplitude output voltages are acceptable, 
for frequency-immune consumers, and thus no inverter is added; a diode rectifier may be con-
nected to the SG stator to yield DC voltage output fully controlled by SG excitation current control.

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
While inverter and diode rectifier-controlled SG will be treated in the variable speed generators vol-
ume, the constant voltage variable frequency generator control will be described here as it involves 
the exciter’s model too.
6.17.1  Variable Frequency/Speed SG with Brushless Exciter
A typical variable frequency/speed SG with a brushless exciter involving three electric machines 
on a single shaft, typical for avionics or gas-turbine-driven (ship, etc.) applications is illustrated in 
Figure 6.56 [35].
The system comprises a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) of low power (< 0.3% p.u.) 
whose stator output is diode rectified and then treated via a DC–DC converter to control the main 
exciter’s stator-placed field winding current. In turn, the latter’s armature winding placed on the com-
mon rotor has the three-phase terminals connected to a diode rectifier (designed at less than 7%–8% p.u. 
power) which supplies the main SG excitation winding.
As there are three electric (synchronous) generators in raw, their rather nonlinear models introduce 
delays, instabilities, and thus a robust control system is needed. Adaptive model-based control [35] has 
certain virtues, but more robust (i.e., sliding mode) control might be tried in the future.
In any case, in model-based control only the dq (orthogonal) model in rotor coordinates suffers 
enough simplicity to be practical.
While the PMSG model may be neglected treating it as a gain in a first instant, a first-order delay may 
be introduced for better precision as

The speed ωr is controlled through the prime mover’s governor. On the other hand, the main SG dq

Ki and Kv are power equivalence (from AC to DC) coefficients; Ved, Veq, ied, and ieq are dq armature volt-
ages and currents of main exciter; δe is the power angle (taken for control as δe ≅ 45°, though it varies 
with load) and Φ ≅ 0 is the power factor angle for the diode rectifier.
The above equations are valid in rectifying mode, where the power in AC is transferred into DC and 
not in the freewheeling operation mode.
Freewheeling mode occurs when the armature currents (especially id) undergoes severe transients 
due to strong changes required in the field current of the main strong changes required in the field cur-
rent of the main generator. The d-axis rotor cage is not capable of presenting freewheeling.
To avoid freewheeling, a feedforward reference field current component, iexchange proportional to the 
id current variation in the main SG is added. This implicitly means that rotor position and speed should 
be available. To avoid an encoder, the small PMSG output voltage/current phases and frequency may be 
used to build a robust rotor position and speed observer. The basic control system of main SG output 
voltage is shown in Figure 6.58.

The control system comprises the following:
An outer AC output voltage amplitude regulator Cv(s)
A feedforward iex reg corrector by feedforward action through iexchange(Cd(s)), as explained earlier 
(to avoid freewheeling)
Main exciter excitation current iex regulator (Cex(s))
Skipping the tedious zeroes and poles selection for Cv(s), Cd(s), and Cex(s), in relation to involved 
machines’ parameters, with one speed adaptive (Cv(s)) and with numerous filters, we present here some 
final results of Reference [35] obtained on a 40 kVA, 115 V, speed 9.6 krpm—16 krpm system.
They refer to various load transients: inductive at high and low speed and capacitive at high speeds 
(Figure 6.59), and to inductive load connection and disconnection without and with speed adaptation of 
Cd(s) in the voltage outer regulator (Figure 6.60).
The results in Figures 6.59 and 6.60 show very good dynamic performance for wide speed and load 
ranges.
It was included here, however, only as an exemplary solution. Robust (variable structure or rule-based) 
control, on the other hand, could offer faster control in less complex reliable systems with increased fault 
tolerance [36].

Control of Synchronous Generators in Power Systems
6.18  Summary
•	 Control of SGs means basically active power (or speed) and reactive power (or voltage) control.
•	 Active power (or speed) control of SGs is performed through turbine closed loop speed 
governing.
•	 Reactive power (or voltage) control is done through field winding voltage (current If) closed loop 
control (AVR).
•	 Though, in principle, weakly coupled, the two controls interact with each other. The main decou-
pling means used thus far is the so-called PSS. The PSS input is based on active power (or speed) 
deviation. Its output enters the AVR control system with the purpose of increasing the damping 
torque component.
•	 When the SG operates in connection with a power system, two more control levels are required 
besides primary control (speed governing and AVR–PSS). They are AGC and economic dispatch 
with security assessment generation allocation control.
•	 AGC refers to frequency-load control and intertie control.
•	 Frequency load control means to allocate frequency (speed)/power characteristics for each SG and 
move them up and down through ACE, to determine how much power contribution is asked for 
each SG.
•	 ACE is formed by frequency error multiplied by a frequency bias factor λR added to intertie power 
error ΔPtie. ACE is then PI controlled to produce load frequency set points for each SG by allocat-
ing pertinent participation factors αi (some of them may be zero).
•	 The amount of intertie power exchange between different areas of a power system and the partici-
pation factors of all SGs are determined in the control computer by the economic dispatch with 
security assessment, based on lowest operation costs per kWh or on other cost functions.
•	 Primary (speed and voltage) control is the fastest (seconds) while economic dispatch is the slowest 
(minutes).
•	 Active and reactive power flow in a power system may be augmented by flexible AC transmission 
systems (FACTS) that make use of power electronics and of various energy storage elements.
•	 Primary (speed and voltage) control is slow enough that third- (fourth-) order simplified SG mod-
els ­suffice for its investigation.
•	 Constant speed (frequency) closed loop is feasible only in isolated SGs.
•	 SGs operating in a power system have speed-droop controllers to allow for power sharing between 
various units.
•	 Speed droop is typically 4%–5%.
•	 Speed governors require at least second-order models, while for hydraulic turbines transient 
speed-droop compensation is required to compensate water starting time effect. Speed governors 
for hydraulic turbines are the slowest in response (up to 20 s and more for settling time), while 
steam turbines are faster (especially in fast valving mode), but they show an oscillatory response 
(settling time is less than 10 s in general).
•	 In an isolated power system with a few SGs, AGC means, in fact, adding an integrator to the 
load–frequency set point of the frequency/power control to keep the frequency constant for that 
generator.
•	 AGC in interconnected power systems means introducing the intertie power exchange error 
ΔPtie with frequency error weighted by the frequency bias factor to form the ACE. ACE contains 
PI filters to produce ΔPref that provides finally the set points level of various generators in each 
area. Consequently, not only the frequency is controlled but also the intertie power exchange. All 
according to, say, minimum operation costs with security assessment.
•	 Time response of SG in speed and power angle for various power perturbations is qualitatively 
divided into four stages: rotor swings, frequency drops, primary control (speed and voltage 

308
Synchronous Generators
control), and secondary control (intertie control and economic dispatch). Frequency band of 
speed governor control in power systems is less than 2 Hz, in general.
•	 Spinning reserve is defined as rated power of all SGs in a system minus the actual power needed 
in certain conditions.
•	 If spinning reserve is not large enough, frequency does not recover; it keeps decreasing. To avoid 
frequency collapse, load is dumped in designated substations in 1–3 stages until frequency recov-
ers. Underfrequency relays trigger load shedding in substations.
•	 Active and reactive powers of various loads depend on voltage and frequency to a larger or smaller 
degree.
•	 Equilibrium of frequency (speed) is reached for active power balance between offer (SG) and 
demand (loads).
•	 Similarly, equilibrium in voltage is reached for balance in reactive power between offer and 
demand. Again if not enough reactive power reserve exists, voltage collapse takes place. To avoid 
voltage collapse either important reactive loads are dumped, or additional reactive power injec-
tion from energy storage elements (capacitors) is performed.
•	 The SG contribution to reactive power (voltage) control is paramount.
•	 Voltage control at SG terminals AVR is done through field winding (excitation) voltage Vf, (cur-
rent If) control. Frequency band of AVRs is within 2–3 Hz, in general.
•	 DC excitation power for SGs is provided by exciters.
•	 Exciters may be of three main types: DC, AC, and static.
•	 DC exciters contain two DC commutator generators mounted on the SG shaft: the auxiliary 
exciter (AE) and the main exciter (ME). The ME armature supplies the SG excitation through 
brushes and slip rings at full excitation power rating. The AE armature excites the ME. The AE 
excitation is power electronics controlled at the command (output) of AVR. DC exciters are in 
existence for SGs up to 100 MW despite of their slow response—due to large time constant of AE 
and ME—and commutator wear, due to low control power of AE.
•	 AC exciters contain an inside-out synchronous generator (ME) with an output is diode-rectified 
and connected to the SG excitation winding. It is a brushless system, as the ME DC excitation 
circuit is placed on the stator and is controlled by power electronics at the command (output) of 
AVR. With only one machine on SG shaft, the brushless AC exciter is more rugged and almost 
maintenance free. The control power is 1/20 (1/30) of SG excitation power rating, but the control is 
faster as now only one machine (ME) time constant additional delay still exists.
•	 Static exciters are placed away from the SG and are connected to the excitation winding of SG 
through brushes and slip rings. They are power electronics (static) AC—DC converters with 
very fast response. Controlled rectifiers are typical but diode rectifiers with capacitor filters and 
4 quadrant choppers are also feasible. Static exciters are the way of the future now that slip ring—
brush energy transmission at 30 MW has been demonstrated in 400 MVA doubly fed induction 
generators pump storage power plants. Also converters up to this rating are already feasible.
•	 Also, competitive contactless power transfer to the SG rotor is feasible.
•	 Exciter modeling requires, for AVR design, a new, nonreciprocal, PU system where the base exci-
tation voltage is that which produces no-load rated voltage at SG terminals at no load. The cor-
responding PU field current is also unity in this case:

•	 The DC exciter model (one level; ME or AE), accounting for magnetic saturation, is a nonlinear 
model that contains a first-order delay and a nonlinear saturation-driven feedback. For small 
signal analysis a first-order model with saturation-variable gain and a time constant is obtained.
•	 For the AC exciter, the same model may be adopted but with one more feedback proportional to 
field SG current, to account for d-axis demagnetizing armature reaction in the ME (alternator).
•	 The diode rectifier may be represented by its steady-state voltage/current output characteristics. 
Three diode commutation modes are present from no load to short circuit. In essence, the diode 
rectifier characteristic shows a voltage regulation dependent on ME commutation (subtransient) 
inductance.
•	 The controlled rectifier may also be modeled by its steady-state voltage/current characteristic with 
the delay angle α as parameter and control variable.
•	 The basic AVR acts upon the exciter input and may have 1–3 stabilizing loops and, eventually, 
additional inputs. The sensed voltage is corrected by a load compensator.
•	 A lead-lag compensator constitutes the typical AVR stabilizing loop.
•	 Various exciters and AVRs are classified in IEEE standard 512.2 of 1992.
•	 Alternative AVR stabilizer loops such as PID (variable structure) are also practical.
•	 All AVR systems are provided with underexcitation (UEL) and overexcitation (OEL) limiters.
•	 Exciter dynamics and AVRs may introduce negative damping generator torques. To counteract 
such a secondary effect, PSSs have been introduced.
•	 PSSs have speed deviation or accelerating power deviation as input and act as an additional input 
to AVR.
•	 The basic PSS contains a gain, a washout (high pass) filter and a phase compensator in order to 
produce torque in phase with speed deviation (positive damping). Washout filter’s role is to avoid 
PSS output voltage modification due to steady-state changes in speed.
•	 Accelerating-power-integral input PSSs have been proven better than speed or frequency or elec-
tric power deviation input PSSs.
•	 Besides independent speed-governing and AVR–PSS control of SGs, coordinated speed and volt-
age SG controls were introduced through multivariable optimal control methods.
•	 Advanced nonlinear digital control methods, such as fuzzy logic, ANN, μ synthesis, H∞, and 
sliding-mode, have been all proposed for integrated SG generator control [37,38].
•	 Power electronics-driven active/reactive power flow in power systems may be defined as FACTS 
(flexible AC transmission systems). They may use of external energy storage elements such as 
capacitors, resistors, inductors (normal or of superconductor material). They also assist in voltage 
support and regulation.
•	 FACTS may enhance the dynamic stability limits of SGs but interfere with their speed-governing 
and AVR.
•	 The steam (or gas) turbines have long multimass shafts of finite rigidity. Their characterization by 
lumped 4.5 masses is typical.
•	 Such flexible shaft systems are characterized by torsional natural frequencies above 6–8 Hz, in 
general, for large turbine generators.
•	 Series compensation by capacitors to increase the transport capacity of long power lines leads 
to the occurrence of offset AC currents at natural frequency fn solely dependent on the degree of 
transmission line reactance compensation by series capacitors (XC/XL < 0.5).
•	 It is the difference f0 − fn, the slip (rotor) frequency of rotor currents due to this phenomenon, that 
may fall over a torsional-free frequency to cause SSR.
•	 SSR may produce shafts breaking or, at least, their premature wearing.

•)>> The slip frequency currents of frequency f0 − fn produced by the series compensation effect, mani-
fest themselves as if the SG were an induction generator connected at the power grid. As slip 
is negative (fn < f0), an equivalent negative resistance is seen by the power grid. This negative 
resistance may overcompensate the transmission line resistance. With negative overall resistance, 
the transmission line reactance plus series compensation capacitor circuit may ignite dangerous 
torque pulsations. This phenomenon is called induction generator self-excitation and has to be 
avoided. One way of doing this is to use a strong (low resistance) damper cage in SGs.
•)>> Various measures to counteract SSR have been proposed. Among them are damping circuit in 
parallel with the series capacitor, thyristor-controlled shunt reactors or capacitors, selected fre-
quency damping in AVR, SMES, protective relays to trip the unit when SSR is detected through 
generator speed or by current feedback sensors oscillations.

able optimal theory methods with self-learning algorithms seems the way of the future and much 
progress in this direction is expected in the near future.

Design of Synchronous Generators
7.1  Introduction
Most of the synchronous generator (SG) power is transmitted through power systems to various loads, 
but there are various stand-alone applications as well.
In this chapter, the design of SGs connected to power system is dealt with in some detail.
The successful design and operation of an SG depends heavily on agreement between the SG manu-
facturer and user in regard to technical requirements (specifications). Published standards such as ANSI 
C50.13 and IEC 34-1 contain these requirements for a broad class of synchronous generators (SGs). The 
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has recently launched two new, consolidated 
standards for high-power SGs [1]:
•	 C50.12—for large salient pole generators
•	 C50.13—for cylindrical rotor large generators
The liberalization of electricity markets led, in the last 10 years, to the gradual separation of production, 
transport, and supply of electrical energy. Consequently, to provide for safe, secure, and reasonable cost sup-
ply, formal interface rules—grid codes—have been put forward recently by private utilities around the world.
Grid codes do not align in many cases with established standards such as IEEE and American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI). Some grid codes exceed the national and international standards 
“Requirements on Synchronous Generators.” Such requirements may impact unnecessarily on ­generator 
costs as they may not produce notable ­benefits for the power system stability [2].
Harmonization of International Standards with grid codes thus becomes necessary, and it is pur-
sued already by joint efforts of SG manufacturers and interconnectors [3] to specify the turbo- and 
­hydrogenerator parameters. Generator specifications parameters are, in turn, related to the design prin-
ciples and, ultimately, to the costs of generator and of its operation (losses, etc.).
New, stricter, grid codes have been imposed recently for wind generators.
In this chapter, a discussion of turbogenerator specifications as guided by standards and grid codes is 
presented, in relation to fundamental design principles. Hydrogenerators pose similar problems in power 
systems, but their power share is notably smaller than that of turbogenerators, except for a few countries such 
as Norway, Brazil, and Romania. Then the design principles and a methodology for salient pole SGs and, 
respectively, of cylindrical rotor generators with numerical examples are presented in considerable detail.
Special design issues related to generator-motors for pump storage plants or self-starting 
­turbo­generators are treated in a dedicated paragraph.
7.2  Specifying Synchronous Generators for Power Systems
Turbogenerators are still at the core of electric power systems. Their prime function is to produce the 
active power [1–6]. However, they are also required to provide (or absorb) reactive power, in a refined 
controlled manner, to maintain both frequency and voltage stability in the power system (see Chapter 6). 

314
Synchronous Generators
As the control of SGs has became lately faster and more robust with advanced nonlinear digital control 
methods, the parameter specification is about to change rather markedly.
7.2.1  Short-Circuit Ratio
The short-circuit ratio (SCR) of a generator is the inverse ratio of saturated direct axis reactance in p.u.
	
SCR
xd sat
=
1
(
)
	
(7.1)
SCR has a direct impact on the static stability and on the leading (absorbed) reactive power capability 
of the SG.
A larger SCR means a smaller xd(sat), and thus almost inevitably a larger air gap. In turn, this requires 
more ampere-turns (mmf) in the field winding to produce the same apparent power.
As the permissible temperature rise is limited by the SG insulation class (class B, in general ΔT = 130°), 
more excitation mmf means a larger rotor volume and thus a larger SG.
Also, the SCR has an impact on SG efficiency. An increase of SCR from 0.4 to 0.5 tends to produce a 
0.02%–0.04% reduction in efficiency while it increases the machine volume by 5%–10% [3].
The impact of SCR on SG static stability may be illustrated by the expression of electromagnetic 
torque te (p.u.) in a lossless SG connected to an infinite power bus:
	
t
SCR E
V
e »
×

(7.2)
The larger the SCR, the larger the torque for given no-load voltage (E0), terminal voltage V1, and power 
angle δ (between E0 and V1 per phase). If the terminal voltage decreases, a larger SCR would lead to a 
smaller power angle δ increase for given torque (active power) and given field current.
If the transmission line reactance—including the generator step-up transformer—is xe and V1 is now 
replaced by the infinite grid voltage Vg behind xe, the generator torque ¢te is

(7.3)
The power angle δ′ is the angle between E0 of generator and Vg of infinite power grid.
The impact of improvement of a larger SCR on maximum output is diminished as xe/xd increases.
Increasing SCR from 0.4 to 0.5 produces the same maximum output if the transmission line reactance 
ratio xe/xd increases from 0.17 to 0.345 at a leading power factor of 0.95 and 85% rated MW output.
Historically, the trend has been toward lower SCRs, from 0.8–1.0, 70 years ago to 0.58–0.65 in the 
1960s and to 0.5–0.4 today. Modern—fast-response—excitation systems compensate for the apparent 
loss of static stability grounds. The lower SCRs mean lower generator volume, losses, and costs.
7.2.2  SCR and ¢
xd Impact on Transient Stability
The critical clearing time of a three-phase fault on the high-voltage side of the SG step-up transformer is 
a representative performance index for the transient stability limits of the SG tied to an infinite bus-bar.
The transient d-axis reactance ¢xd (in p.u.) takes the place of xd in Equation 7.3 to approximate the 
generator torque transients before the fault clearing. In the case in point xe = xTsc is the short-circuit 
reactance (in p.u.) of the step-up transformer. A lower ¢xd allows for a larger critical clearing time and so 
does a large inertia. Air-cooled SGs tend to have a larger inertia/MW than hydrogen-cooled SGs as their 
rotor size is relatively larger and so is their inertia.

7.2.3  Reactive Power Capability and Rated Power Factor
A typical family of V curves is shown in Figure 7.1. The reactive power capability curve (Figure 7.2) 
and the V curves are more or less equivalent in reflecting the SG capability to deliver active and 
reactive power, or to absorb reactive power until the various temperature limitations are met 
(Chapter 5).
The rated power factor determines the delivered/lagging reactive power continuous rating at rated 
active power of the SG.

Synchronous Generators
The lower the rated (lagging) power factor, the larger the MVA per rated MW. Consequently, 
the excitation power is increased and the step-up transformer has to be rated higher (MVA). The 
rated power factor is placed, in general, in the interval 0.9–0.95 (overexcited) as a compromise 
between generator initial and loss capitalized costs and power system requirements. Lower values 
down to 0.85(0.8) may be found in air-(hydrogen)-cooled SGs. The minimum underexcited rated 
power factor is 0.95 at rated active power. The maximum absorbed (leading) reactive power limit is 
determined by the SCR and corresponds to maximum power angle and (or) to end stator core over-
temperature limit.
7.2.4  Excitation Systems and Their Ceiling Voltage
Fast control of excitation current is needed to preserve SG transient stability and control its voltage. 
Higher ceiling excitation voltage, corroborated with low electrical time constants in the excitation 
­system, provides for fast excitation current control.
Today’s ceiling voltages are in the range of 1.6–3.0 p.u. There is a limit here dictated by the effect of 
magnetic saturation that makes ceiling voltages above 1.6–2.0 p.u. hardly practical.
This is more so as higher ceiling voltage means sizing the insulation system of the exciter or the rating 
of the static exciter voltage for maximum ceiling voltage at notably larger exciter’s costs.
The debate over which is best: the AC brushless exciter or static exciter (which is specified also 
with a negative ceiling voltage of: −1.2 to 1.5 p.u.) is still not over. A response time of 50 ms in 
“producing” the maximum ceiling voltage is today fulfilled by the AC brushless exciters, but faster 
responses times are feasible with static exciters. However, during system faults, the AC brush-
less exciter is not notably disturbed as it draws its input from the kinetic energy of the turbine–­
generator unit.
In contrast, the static exciter is fed from the exciter transformer that is connected, in general, at SG 
terminals and seldom to a fully independent power source. Consequently, during faults, when the gen-
erator terminal voltage decreases, to secure fast rather undisturbed excitation current response, a higher 
voltage ceiling ratio is required.
Also, existing static exciters transmit all power to the SG excitation through the brush–slip-ring 
(mechanical) system with all the limitations and maintenance incumbent problems.
7.2.4.1  Voltage and Frequency Variation Control
As detailed in Chapter 6, the SG has to deliver active and reactive power with designed speed and volt-
age variations.
The size of the generator is related to the active power (frequency) and reactive power (voltage) 
requirements. Typical such practical requirements are shown in Figure 7.3.
In general, SGs should be thermally capable of continuous operation within the limits of P/Q curve 
(Figure 7.2) over the ranges of ±5% in voltage but not necessarily at the power level typical for rated 
frequency and voltage.
Voltage increase, accompanied by frequency decrease, means a higher increase in the V/ω ratio.
The total flux in the machine increases. A maximum of flux increase is considered practical and 
should be there by design. The SG has to be sized to have a reasonable magnetic saturation level (coeffi-
cient) such that the field mmf (and losses) and the core loss are not increased so much to compromise the 
thermal constrains in the presence of corresponding adjustments of active and reactive power delivery 
under these conditions.
To avoid oversizing the SG, the continuous operation is guaranteed only in the hatched are, at most 
47.5–52 Hz.
In general, the +5% overvoltage is allowed only above rated frequency, to limit the flux increase in the 
machine to maximum 5%.

317
Design of Synchronous Generators
The rather large (±5)% voltage variation is met by SGs using tap changers on the generator step-up 
transformer (IEC).
7.2.4.2  Negative Phase Sequence Voltage and Currents
Grid codes tend to restrict the negative sequence voltage component at 1% (V1/V2 in %). Peaks 
up to 2% might be accepted for short duration by prior agreement between manufacturer and 
interconnector.
The SGs should be able to withstand such voltage imbalance that translates into negative sequence 
currents in the stator and rotor with negative sequence reactance x2 = 0.10 (the minimum accepted by 
IEC) and a step-up transformer with a reactance xT = 0.15 p.u. Then the 1% voltage unbalance translates 
into a negative sequence current i2 (p.u. in%) of

(7.4)
The SG has to be designed to withstand the additional losses in the rotor damper cage, in the excitation 
winding and in the stator winding, produced by the negative sequence stator current. Turbogenerators 
above 700 MV seem to need explicit damper windings for the scope.
7.2.4.3  Harmonic Distribution
Grid codes specify the total harmonic voltage distortion (THD) at 1.5% and 2% in near 400 kV and 
respectively, in the near 275 kV power systems. Proposals are made to raise these values to 3(3.5)% 
in the voltage THD. The voltage THD may be converted into current THD and then into an equiva-
lent current for each harmonic, considering that the inverse reactance x2 may be applied for time 
harmonics as well.
For the fifth time harmonic, for example, a 3% voltage THD corresponds to a current i5:

7.2.4.4  Temperature Basis for Rating
Observable and hot-spot temperature limits appear in IEEE/ANSI standards, but only the former 
appears in IEC-60034 standards.
In principle, the observable temperature limits have to be set such that the hot-spot temperatures 
should not go above 130° for insulation class B and 155° for insulation class F.
In practice, one design could meet observable temperatures (in a few spots in the SG) but exceed the 
hot-spot limits of the insulation class. Or we may overrestrict the observable temperature, while the hot-
spot are well below the insulation class limit.
Also, the rated cold coolant temperature has to be specified if the hot-spot temperature is main-
tained constant when the cold coolant temperature varies, as for temperature—following SGs where the 
observable temperature also varies.
Holding one of the two temperature limits as constant, with cold coolant (ambient) temperature vari-
able, leads to different SG over (under) rating (Figure 7.4).
It seems thus reasonable to fix the observable temperature limit for a single cold coolant tem-
perature and calculate the SG MVA capability for different cold coolant (ambient) and hot-spot 
temperatures.
This way, the SG is exploited optimally, especially for the “ambient following” operation mode.
7.2.4.5  Ambient: Following Machines
SGs that operate for ambient temperatures for −20° to +50° should have permissible generator output 
power, variable with cold—coolant temperatures. Eventually, peak (short-term) and base MVA capabili-
ties should be set at rated power factor (Figure 7.5).
7.2.4.6  Reactances and Unusual Requirements
The already mentioned d-axis synchronous reactance xd and d-axis transient reactance ¢xd are key ­factors 
in defining static and transient stability and maximum leading reactive power rating of SG.
In general, it is practice that xd and ¢xd values are subject for agreement between vendors and 
purchasers of SGs, based on operating conditions (weak or strong power system area exciter per-
formance, etc.).

Design of Synchronous Generators
To limit the peak short-circuit current and circuit breaker rating it may be considered appropriate to 
specify (or agree upon) a minimum value of the subtransient reactances at the saturation level of rated 
voltage.
Also, the maximum value of unsaturated (at rated current) value of transient d-axis reactance ¢xd  may 
be limited based on unsaturated and saturated subtransient and transient reactances, see IEEE 100 (11).
There should be tolerances for these agreed-upon values of ¢¢
xd and ¢xd, positive for first one 
(+20% ÷ 30%) and negative (−20% ÷ –30%) for the second one.
7.2.4.7  Start–Stop Cycles
The total number of starts is important to specify as the SG should by design prevent cyclic fatigue 
degradation.
According to IEC, IEEE, and ANSI trends, it seems that the number of starts should be as follows:
•)>> 3,000 for base load SGs
•)>> 10,000 for peaking load SGs or other frequently cycled units [1]
7.2.4.8  Starting and Operation as a Motor
Combustion turbines generator units may be started with the SG as a motor fed from static power converter 
of lower rating, in general. Power electronics rating, drivetrain losses, inertia, speed versus time, and the 
­restart intervals have to be considered to assure that the generator temperatures are all within limits.
Pump-storage hydrogenerator units also have to be started as motors on no-load, with power elec-
tronics, or back-to-back from a dedicated generator that is accelerated simultaneously with the motor 
asynchronous starting.
The pumping action will force the SG to work as a synchronous motor and the hydraulic turbine–
pump and generator–motor characteristics have to be optimally matched to best exploit the power unit 
in both operation modes.

7.2.4.9  Faulty Synchronization
SGs are also designed to survive without repairs after synchronization with ±10° initial power angle. 
Faulty synchronization (outside ±10°) may cause short-duration current and torque peaks larger than 
during sudden short circuits. As a result, internal damage of SG may result, and so inspection for dam-
age is required.
Faulty synchronization at 120° or 180° out of phase with a low system reactance (infinite) bus might 
require partial rewind of the stator or (and) extensive rotor repairs.
A special attention should be paid to these aspects from design stage onward.
7.2.4.10  Forces
Forces in an SG occur due to the following reasons:
•)>> System faults
•)>> Thermal expansion cycles
•)>> Double-frequency (electromagnetic) running forces
The relative number of cycles for peaking units (one start per day for 30 years) is shown in Figure 7.6 [4], 
together with the force level.
For system faults (short-circuit, faulty, or successful synchronization) forces have the highest level 
(100:1). The thermal expansion forces have an average level (1:1), while the double-frequency running 
forces are the smallest in intensity (1:10).
A base load unit would encounter a much smaller thermal expansion cycle count.
The mechanical design of SG should manage all these forces and secure safe operation over the entire 
anticipated operation life of the SG.
7.2.4.11  Armature Voltage
In principle, the armature voltage may vary in a 2:1 ratio without having to change magnetic flux or the 
armature reaction mmf, that is, for same machine geometry.
Choosing the voltage should be the privilege of the manufacturer, to enable him enough freedom to 
produce the best designs for given constraints.
The voltage level determines the insulation between the armature winding and the slot walls in an 
indirectly cooled SG. Not so in directly cooled stator (rotor) windings where the heat is removed through

a cooling channel located in the slots. Consequently, directly cooled SG may be designed for higher volt-
ages (say 28 kV instead of 22 kV) without paying a too-high price in cooling expenses.
However, for air-cooled generators, higher voltage may influence the Corona effect. Not so in hydrogen-
cooled SGs, because of higher Corona-start voltage.
7.2.4.12  Runaway Speed
The runaway speed is defined as the speed the prime mover may be allowed to have if it is suddenly 
unloaded from full (rated) load. Steam (or gas) turbines are, in general, provided with quick action 
speed governors set to trip the generator at 1.1 times the rated speed.
Therefore, the runaway speed for turbogenerators may be set at 1.25 p.u. speed.
For water (hydro) turbines, the runaway speeds are much higher (at full gate opening):
•	 1.8 p.u. for Pelton (impulse) turbines—SGs
•	 2.0–2.2 p.u. for Francis turbines—SGs
•	 2.5–2.8 p.u. for Kaplan (reaction) turbines—SGs
The SGs are designed to withstand mechanical stress at runaway speeds. The maximum peripheral 
speed is about 140–150 m/s for salient-pole SGs and 175–180 m/s for turbogenerators. The rotor diameter 
design is limited by this maximum peripheral speed.
The turbogenerator are built today in general in only two-pole configurations, either at 50 Hz or at 
60 Hz.
7.2.4.13  Design Issues
SG design deals with many issues, but the most important ones are the following:
•	 Output coefficient and basic stator geometry
•	 The number of stator slots
•	 Design of stator winding
•	 Design of stator core
•	 Salient pole rotor design
•	 Cylindrical rotor design
•	 Open-circuit saturation curve
•	 Field current at full load
•	 Stator leakage inductance, resistance, and synchronous reactance calculation
•	 Losses and efficiency calculation
•	 Calculation of time constants and transient and subtransient reactances
•	 Cooling system and thermal design
•	 Design of brushes and slip-rings (if any)
•	 Design of bearings
•	 Brakes and jacks design
•	 Exciter design
Currently, design methodologies of SGs are today put in the computer codes, and they may contain 
optimization stages and interface with finite element software for refined calculation of electromag-
netic, thermal, and mechanical stress, either for verification or for a final geometrical optimization 
design stage.
7.3  Output Power Coefficient and Basic Stator Geometry
The output coefficient C is defined as the SG kVA per cubic meter of rotor volume. The value of C (kVA/m3) 
depends on machine power/pole, the number of pole pairs p1, and the type of cooling, and it is much based 
on past experience (Figure 7.7).

The air gap flux density Bg1 relates to magnetic specific loading (saturation level), while A1 defines the 
electric-specific loading.
C is not quite equal to power/rotor volume but is proportional to it. The proportionality coefficient is π/4.
Going further, we might define the average shear stress on rotor ft (specific tangential force in N/m2 
or N/cm2):

Therefore, the power output coefficient C is proportional to specific tangential force ft exerted on the 
rotor exterior surface by the electromagnetic torque; with C in VA/m3, ft comes into N/m2. In general, 
C is given in kVA/m3.
As can be seen in Figure 7.7, C is given as a function of power per pole: Ps/2p1 [5]. Direct water cooling 
in turbogenerators (2p1 = 2, 4) allows for the highest output power coefficient.
The provisional rotor diameter D of SGs is, in general, limited by the maximum peripheral speed 
(140–150 m/s) with 44–55 kg/mm2 yield point, typical rotor core materials.
This maximum peripheral speed Umax is to be reached at the runaway speed nmax, set by design as 
discussed earlier:

The intervals for λ are rather large, leaving ample freedom to designer.
Though optimization design may be performed, it is good to have a good design start, and so λ has to 
be in the intervals suggested by Equation 7.19.
With the output power coefficient C given by Equation 7.10, and based on past experience, the air gap 
flux density fundamental Bg1 is
	
Bg1 = 0.75–1.05 T for cylindrical rotor SGs
	
Bg1 = 0.80–1.05 T for salient pole rotor SGs
Correspondingly, with C from Figure 7.7 the linear current loading A (A/m) intervals may be calcu-
lated for various cooling methods. The orientative design current density intervals may also be specified 
(Table 7.1).

7.4  Number of Stator Slots
The first requirement on the number of stator slots is to produce symmetrical (balanced) three-phase 
emfs.

A larger integer q is typical for turogenerators (2p1 = 2, 4): q > (4–6).
For low-speed generators, q may be as low as 3 but not less. For q < 3, 4 and large power hydrogenera-
tors a fractionary q winding is adopted:

Now x has to be an integer and 2K has to be divisible by d. Also, d may not contain a 3p factor as this is 
eliminated from K.
For fractionary windings not only Ns should be a multiple of 3 but also the denominator c of q should 
not contain 3 as a factor.
According to Equation 7.21, if Ns contains a factor of 3p, then p1 (pole pairs number) should contain it 
also so that it would not appear in c.
In large SGs, the stator core is made of segments (Chapter 4) as the lamination sheets size is limited 
to 1–1.1 m in width.

In general, it is advisable that Nss be an even number so that Ns has to be an even number. But in such 
cases, apparently, only integer q values are feasible. For fractionary windings, Nss may be an odd number 
and contain 3 as a factor.
Moreover, large stator bore diameter hydrogenerators have their stator core made of a few NK sections 
that are wound at manufacturer’s site and assembled together at the user’s site.
Therefore, the number of slots Ns has to be divisible by both Nc and NK.
In large SGs, the stator coil turns are made by transposed copper bars and in general there is one 
turn (bar) per coil. Therefore, the total number of turns for all three phases—3⋅a⋅Wa—is equal to the

The number of current paths in parallel depends on many factors such as the type of winding (lap or 
wave) and the number of stator sectors.
With tentative values for a and Wa obtained from Equations 7.26 through 7.30 and Wa rounded to a 
multiple of 3 (for three phases), the number of slots is calculated from Equation 7.25. Then, it is verified 
if Ns is divisible by the number of stator sections NK.
The number of stator sections is, in general,
	
NK = 2  for D < 4 m
	
NK = 4  for D = 4 ÷ 8 m	
(7.33)
	
NK = 6 (8)  for D > 8 m
To obtain a symmetrical winding for fractionary q = b + c/d, we need 2p1/d = integer and, as pointed out

7.5  Design of Stator Winding
The main stator winding types for SGs have been introduced in Chapter 4. For turbo generators, with 
q > 4 (5), and integer q two layers windings with lap- or wave-chorded coils are typical. They are fully 
symmetric with 60° phase spread per pole.
Example 7.1:  Integer q Turbogenerator Winding
Let us take a numerical example of a 2 pole turbogenerator with an interior stator diameter 
Dis = 1.0 m and with a typical slot pitch τs ≈ 60–70 mm. Let us find an appropriate number of 
slots for integer q and then build a two-layer winding for it.

Fortunately, the number of turns per current path, which occupies just one pole of the two, is 
equal to the value of q. A multiple of q would be also possible. With Wa = 8, we do have one turn/
coil, therefore the coils are made of single bars aggregated from transposed conductors.

The condition Wa = q (or kq) could in general be fulfilled with modified stator bore diameter or

In small machines, Wa = kq with k > 2.

•	 Draw the star of slot emfs with Ns/t = 48 elements (Figure 7.9).
•	 Divide the distinct emfs in 2 × m = 6 equal zones. Opposite zones represent the in and out 
slots of a phase in the first layer. The angle between the beginnings of phases A, B, and C 
is 2π/3, clockwise.
•	 From each in and out slot phase coils are initiated in layer 1 and completed in layer 2, from 
left to right according to the coil span y: y =

 slot pitches (Figure 7.10).
Using wave–bar coils and two current paths in parallel, practically no additional ­connectors to 
complete the phase are necessary.
The single-turn bar coils with wave connections are usually used for hydrogenerators (2p1 > 4) 
to reduce overall length of connectors—at the price of some additional labor. Here, the very 
large power of the SG at only 12 kV line voltage has imposed a single-turn coil winding.
Doubling the line voltage to 24 kV would lead to a 2 turn-coil winding where lap coils are 
preferable in general.
For the fractionary windings, so typical for hydrogenerators, after setting the most appropri-
ate value of fractionary q in the previous paragraph, an example is worked out here.

330
Synchronous Generators
Example 7.2:  Fractionary q Winding
Consider the case of 100 MVA hydrogenerator designed at Vnl = 15,500 V (RMS line voltage, star 
connection), fn = 50 Hz, cos ϕn = 0.9, nn = 150 rpm, and nmax = 250 rpm.
Let us calculate the main stator geometry and then with Bg1 = 0.9 T, the number of turns with 
one current path and design a single-turn (bar) coil winding with fractionary q.

Therefore, the total number of segments of stator core is Nc⋅NK = 5⋅6 = 30. For a 10.7 m rotor 
diameter, this is a reasonable value (lamination sheet width is less than 1.1–1.2 m).
Though Nss = 15 slots/segment is an odd (instead of even) number, it is acceptable.
Finally, we adopt qave = 3 34 for 40 pole single-turn bar winding with one current path.
To build the winding, we adopt a similar path as for integer q:

•	 Draw the emf star observing that only 45 of them are distinct and every 10 of them are 
overlapping each other (Figure 7.11).
As there are only 45 (Ns/t) distinct emfs, it is enough to consider them, only, as the situation 
repeats itself identically 10 times. After 4 poles (d = 4 in q = b + c/d), the situation repeats itself.
•	 Calculate:

 and start by allocating phase A 8 in—emfs (slots) and 7 
out—emfs such tat the 8 ones and 7 ones are in phase opposition as much as possible. In 
our case in-slots for phase A are (1, 2, 3, 4, 24, 25, 26, 27) and out slots are (13, 14, 15, 35, 36, 
37, 38).
•	 Proceed the same way for phases B and C by allowing groups of 8 and 7 neighboring 
slots to alternate. Also, the sequence (clockwise) to complete the circle is A, C′, B, A′, 
C, B′.
•	 The division of slots between the two layers is valid in layer 1; for layer 2, the allocation 
comes naturally by observing the coils span y:

It is possible to choose y = 9, 10, 11 but y = 10 seems a good compromise in reducing the fifth and 
seventh space harmonics while not reducing the emf fundamental too much.
Note:  For fractionary q, some of connections between successive bars of a bar—wave winding 
have to made of separate (nonwave) connectors.
For a minimum number of such additional connectors, y1 (Figure 7.11) should be as close as 
possible to two times the pole pitch and 6q = integer.

¹ integer, thus the situation is not ideal. But the symmetry of the 
winding is notable as there are 10 identical zones of the winding, each spanning 4 poles.
The first 45 slots with all phases allocation completed, but only with phase. A coils shown, is 
given in Figure 7.12.
As Figure 7.12 shows, there is only one nonwave connector per phase for Ns/t section of 
machine.
A simple rule for allocation of slots per phases is apparent from Figure 7.12.
Based on the sequence A, C′, B, A′, C, B′ …, we allocate for each phase group d slots for b 
groups and then c slots for one group and repeat this sequence for all the slots of the machine. 
Again, d should not be divisible by 3 for symmetry (q = b + c/d).
The allocation of slots to phase may be also done through tables [6], but the principle is the 
same as above.
The emf star has the added advantage of allowing simple verifications for phase balance by 
finding the position of resultant emf of each phase after adding the up (forward) and the oppo-
site of down (backward) emfs.
It is also evident that the distribution factor formula (Equation 7.29) may be adopted for the 
purpose by noting that the number of vectors included should not be q but the denominator 
of q, that is, bd + c, in our case 3⋅3 + 3 = 15 = 8 + 7 vectors:

7.6  Design of Stator Core
By now in our design process, the rotor diameter D, the stator core ideal length li, the pole pitch τ, and 
the number of slots Ns are all already calculated as shown in previous paragraphs.
To design the stator core, the stator bore diameter Dis is first required. But to accomplish this, the air 
gap g has to be calculated first, because

Calculating or choosing the air gap should account for the required SCR (or 1/xd):
•	 The reduction of air gap flux density harmonics due to slot openings such that to limit the emf 
time harmonics within standards requirements.
•	 Increased excitation winding losses with larger air gap.
•	 Reduced stator space harmonics losses in the rotor with larger air gap, for given stator slotting.
•	 Mechanical limitation on air gap that might vary during operation by at most 10% of its rated value.
The trend today is to impose smaller SCR (0.4–0.6), that is, smaller air gap, to reduce the excitation wind-
ing losses. Transient stability is to be preserved through fast exciter voltage forcing by adequate control.
With smaller air gap, care must be exercised in estimating the emf time harmonics and the additional 
rotor surface (or cage) losses.
Therefore, it seems reasonable to adopt the air gap based on a preliminary calculated value of the xd:

Equation 7.66 is valid for constant air gap salient poles. For hydrogenerators, with reduced air gap, the 
air gap under the salient poles varies to yield a more sinusoidal air gap flux density distribution.
With τp/τ ≈ 0.62−0.75 in general Kad > 0.9 for uniform air gap, but it is lower for increased nonuni-
form air gap.
The Carter coefficient KC, which includes the influence of slot openings, and the effect of radial chan-
nels in the stator core stack are also unknown at this stage of the design, but in general KC < 1.15.
Finally, the magnetic saturation level is not known yet, but is known to be less than 0.25 (Ksd < 0.25). 
Therefore, basically, Equations 7.64 and 7.65 with assigned values of Kad, Kc, and Ksd and known ­winding 
data Wa, KW1 (from the previous paragraph) provide a preliminary value for the air gap to secure the 
required value of xd.

Note:  The rather small specified SCR led to a high xd(xd = 2.0) and thus to a rather small air gap for this 
10.7 m rotor diameter with a 0.8453 m pole pitch.
Turbogenerators are characterized by larger air gap for same A, Bg1, and SCR as τ is notably larger.
Moreover, the smaller periphery length (smaller diameter) in turbogenerators imposes larger values 
of A than in hydrogenerators; one more reason for a larger air gap. Air gaps of 60–70 mm in 2 pole, 1.2 m 
rotor diameter turbogenerators are not uncommon.
This preliminary air gap value is to be modified if the desired xd is not obtained, or some of the 
mechanical, emf harmonics or additional losses constraints are not met.
The stator terminal line voltage is chosen based on the following:
•	 Insulation costs
•	 Insulation maintenance costs
•	 Step-up transformer, power switches, and protection costs
In general, the higher the power, the higher the voltage.
Also, the voltage is higher for directly cooled windings because the transmission through conductor 
and slot insulation to the slot walls is not a main constraint anymore.

KFe is the iron filling factor that accounts for the existing insulation layer between laminations. For 
0.5 mm thick laminations, KFe ≈ 0.93–0.95.
The open stator slots may house uni-turn (bar) or multiturn (two in general) coils placed in two layers 
(Figure 7.14).
The single- and two-turn coils are made of multiple rectangular cross-section conductors in parallel 
that have to be fully transposed (Figure 7.15) in large power SGs (Roebel bars). The elementary conductor 
height hc is smaller than 2.5 mm in general.
The elementary conductors are transposed to cancel eddy currents induced by each of them in the 
others and thus reduce drastically the total skin effect AC resistance factor (more details in the forth-
coming paragraph on stator resistance). The transposition provides for positioning each elementary 
conductor in all the positions of the other conductors, along the stack length. The transposition step 
along stack length is above 30 mm, and there should be as many transpositions as many elementary 
conductors are used to make a turn.

For direct cooling, the copper area per slot area is smaller than for indirect cooling because each elemen-
tary conductor has an interior channel for the coolant.
A single layer single turn per coil winding, as shown in Figure 7.16, exhibits sequences of two solid 
elementary conductors followed by a tubular one.
It is also possible to use only tubular elementary conductors.
The slot area Aslotu may be calculated by knowing the total current per slot, the design current density

In general, the output power coefficient secures values of ampere-turns per slot that lead to fulfilling 
constraints Equation 7.74.
The design current density depends on the adopted cooling system; and for start values, Table 7.1 may 
be used. Also, it should be noted that the terminal voltage impresses lower limits on slot width with 
orientative values from 15 mm below 6 kV (line voltage) up to 35–40 mm at 24 kV. The slot total filling 
factor goes down from values of up to 0.55 below 6 kV to less than 0.3–0.35 at 20 kV and higher, for indi-
rect cooling. Smaller values of Kfill are practical for direct cooling windings.

As the slots are rectangular, the teeth are rather trapezoidal, therefore the tooth flux density Bt1 varies

Example 7.3:  Stator Slot and Yoke Sizing
For same hydrogenerator as in Example 7.2 with Sn = 100 MVA, In = 4000 A, Unl = 15 kV, 2p1 = 
40, D = 10.7 m, li = 0.647 m, Ns = 450, air gap g = 2.1 × 10−2 m, Bg1 = 0.9 T, Wa = 150 turns/current 
path, a = 1 current paths, indirect air cooling, the size of the stator slot, yoke, find the stator core 
outer diameter Dos.
Solution
For indirect air cooling, a total slot filling factor is adopted Kfill = 0.4.
The current density (Table 7.1) is jcos = 6.0 A/mm2.

The ratio hs/bs = 111/30 = 3.7033 < 4 as suggested in Equation 7.74.
The rather low hs/bs ratio tends to produce a low stator slot leakage inductance, that is, a reduc-
tion in ¢xd also. As the maximum value of ¢xd is limited for transient stability reasons, it may be 
adequate to retain this slot geometry.
The moderate Btmax does not account for the further reduction of the tooth width in the wedge area.

7.7  Salient: Pole Rotor Design
Hydrogenerators and most industrial generators make use of salient pole rotors. They are also to be 
found in some wind-generators above 2 MW/unit.
The air gap under the rotor pole shoe gets larger toward the pole shoe ends (Figure 7.17).
In general, gmax/g = 1.5–2.5 to make the air gap flux density, produced by the field current, rather 
sinusoidal.

In reality, the pole shoe may be cut from 1 to 1.8 mm laminations along a circle with radius Rp < D/2 
where D is the rotor diameter at minimum air gap (g).

coils and limiting the interpole flux linkage:

In general, αi increases with the pole pitch τ reaching 0.75 at τ = 0.8 m.
Also, the ratio between the pole shoe span bp and the stator slot pitch τs should be bp/τs > 5.5 to avoid 
notable pulsations in the emf due to stator slotting. With q ≥ 3, this condition is met automatically for 
all values of αi in Equation 7.79.
Given the central and maximum air gaps (g and gmax), rotor diameter D and the pole shoe span bp, the 
radius Rp of the pole shoe shape is approximately

In general, for Bgaν = 0.7 (Bg1 = 0.9 T), Kh starts from 0.3 at τ = 0.4 m and ends at 0.1 for τ = 1 m. Higher 
values of Kh may be used for smaller air gap flux densities.
To design the field winding, the rated, Vfn, and peak, Vfmax, voltages have to be known, together with 
field pole mmf WfIf. By Ifn, we mean the excitation current required to produce full voltage at full-load 
and rated power factor. At this stage of the design method, Ifn is not known and it may not be calculated 
rigorously, because the rotor pole and yoke design is not finished.
But a preliminary design of rotor pole and yoke is feasible here.
Example 7.4:  Salient Pole Rotor Preliminary Design
For the data in Example 7.3, let us design the rotor salient pole. The ratio gmax/g = 2.5.

there are chances that the calculated rated field pole m.m.f. WFIFn will suffice for rated power, 
rated voltage, and rated power factor.
However, let us also note that the rated current density was raised to 10 A/mm2 in the rotor, 
in contrast to 6 A/mm2 in the stator. The much shorter end connections justify this choice. 
Later in the design, the rather exact WFIFn value will be calculated.
The rotor yoke design is basically similar to the stator yoke design, but there is an additional, leak-
age (interpole) magnetic flux to consider. Later on, it will be calculated in detail but for now a 10%–15% 
increase in polar flux is enough to allow for the rotor yoke radial height hyr preliminary calculation:

7.8  Damper Cage Design
Stator space mmf harmonics of order 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, … as well as air gap permeance harmonics due to 
slot openings, induce voltages and thus produce currents in the rotor damper winding. These stator mmf-
aggregated space harmonics are reduced drastically by fractionary windings (q = b + c/d) whose first slot 
harmonics is 6 (bd + c) ± 1. When bd + c > 9, these harmonics are negligible; and thus, it is feasible to use the 
same slot pitch in the stator τs and in the rotor τd: τs = τd. However, for integer q or bd + c < 9 or q = b + 1/2:

 (thus limiting the open

free axial circulation of cooling agent between rotor poles.

It is thus practical to use copper end plates that follow the shape of the poles and extend below the first 
row of pole bolts. They are located right between the laminated rotor pole core and the end plate made 
of steel (Figure 7.19).
For good contact with the copper bars, the copper end-plate should have a thickness of about 10 mm, 
in general [6].
The copper plate plays the role of the complete end ring but without obstructing the cooler axial flow 
between the rotor poles. Also, it is mechanically more rugged than the latter.
7.9  Design of Cylindrical Rotors
The cylindrical rotor is made, in general, from solid iron with milled slots over about 2/3 of periphery 
such that to produce 2p1 poles with distributed field coils in slots (Chapter 4)—Figure 7.20. Slots are 
radial and open in Figure 7.20.
According to Chapter 4, Equation 4.23, the air gap flux density produced by the distributed field 
winding is

The rotor excitation slot pitch τf should be chosen in relation to stator slot pitch τs such that the stator 
emf harmonics and solid rotor eddy current losses are minimized.

Nfp is the number of field winding slots per rotor pole; Kc is the Carter coefficient accounting for the 
apparent increase of air gap due to stator and rotor slotting and for the presence of radial cooling chan-
nels (if any). Magnetic saturation is accounted for by Ks, which in general is Ks < 0.2–0.25.
Example 7.5:  Field Winding Design
Let us consider a 2 pole 30 MVA, 50 Hz, cos φn = 0.9 lagging turbo generator. With a stator bore 
diameter Dis = 0.85 m, Nfp(in the rotor) = 12 slots/pole, Bg1 = 0.825 T, A = 56,000 A/m, SCR = 0.55, Vfn = 
500 V, Vfmax = 2Vfn.
Design the pertinent field winding after calculating the necessary air gap g.

The aspect ratio of the slot is rather small (hsr/Wsr = 2.289), and thus either the current density 
might be reduced or, if needed, higher then in Equation 7.98 field mmfs are feasible.
To finish the design, let us calculate the number of turns per coil and the conductor cross-section.
The field circuit rated voltage Vfn should be considered for designing the field winding, with 
the voltage ceiling left for field current forcing during transients to enhance transient stability 
limits with a rather small SCR = 0.5.

For a 30 MW SG, this means only 0.229%.
The rather small air gap (g = 20 × 10−3 m), the moderate rated current density (jcor = 6 × 106 A/m2) 
and the 2/1 ratio between full-load and no-load field mmf may justify the rather small power 
(0.229%) in the field winding.

Design of Synchronous Generators
The Carter coefficient KC is, in general, the product of at least two of three terms:
•	 KC1—accounting for air gap increase due to stator slot openings
•	 KC2—accounting for air gap increase due to rotor slotting (caused for damper cage slots or by the 
field winding slots)
•	 KC3—accounting for the air gap increase due to radial channels opening bc
When the air gap varies under the salient rotor pole shoe from g to gmax, in calculating KC1, KC2, and KC3, 
an average air gap ga is used:

­present both on the stator and the rotor.
When the air gap is constant (cylindrical rotors) ga = g, as expected.
We will proceed to an analytical calculation of open-circuit magnetization curve because we have all 
the components, for given air gap flux density Bg1 (or Bav) defined in previous paragraphs. All but one: 
the interpole rotor leakage flux Φrl, which is dependent on the mmf drop along the air gap + stator teeth

lpi is the total rotor iron length of Equation 7.81; all other dimensions are visible in Figure 7.22.
The coefficients Cps and Cp account for the fact that only a part of the leakage flux adds in the pole shoe 
and in the pole regions.
With the rotor flux densities known, the corresponding rotor mmf Fps, Fp, Fyr per pole may be calculated.
Therefore, all the terms in Equation 7.112 may be calculated for given air gap flux density fundamental.

Design of Synchronous Generators
The d axis magnetization reactance reduction coefficient Kad (Chapter 4) accounts for the rotor saliency, 
and it is equal to unity for cylindrical rotor.
The whole open-circuit saturation curve may be calculated without any iteration by just repeating the 
above computation sequence for ever higher values of Bg1 until the no-load voltage E1 reaches about 130% 
of the generator rated terminal phase voltage. The acquired data allow also for the representation of the 
so-called partial no-load magnetization curves (Figure 7.23).
The partial magnetization curves are in general used to calculate the rated field mmf at rated power, 
voltage and rated lagging power factor. Also, the no-load magnetization curve is essential to design and 
control of autonomous SGs.
The horizontal variable is either total field mmf F10 or the partial stator ± air gap mmf, Frl, and, respec-
tively, the rotor mmf Frr. Also, Φ1g is the air gap flux per pole, 2Φrl is the total interpolar rotor leakage flux, 
and Φ1r is the total flux per pole in the rotor (Φ1r = 2Φrl + Φ1g).
The air gap flux Φ1g is proportional to emf E1 of Equation 7.105. Therefore, in p.u. values Φ1g and E1 are 
superimposed in Figure 7.23.
7.11  On-Load Excitation mmf F1n
Calculating the on-load excitation F1n per pole is essential in designing the SG in relation to field wind-
ing losses and overtemperatures.
Traditionally, there are two methods to calculate F1n:
	
1.	 The Potier diagram method
	
2.	 The partial magnetization curve method
The Potier diagram is meant for cylindrical rotors, while the partial magnetization curve method is 
necessary for the salient-pole rotor.
What is needed in both methods is the rated armature mmf Fa1, the rated voltage, and the leakage 
stator reactance, xsl. At this stage in the design, xsl may be calculated.
For now, we consider it known (in general xsl = 0.09−0.15 for all SGs and increases with power). The

7.11.1  Potier Diagram Method
The diagram in Figure 7.24 is drawn in p.u. with rated terminal voltage Vn as base voltage. Also, the base 
field mmf corresponds to field mmf at rated voltage under no-load.
With the rated voltage along the vertical axis and the rated power factor angle, the phase of rated 
current is visualized.
Then, with xp in p.u.—the segment AB—90° ahead of I1n—the total (air gap) emf at rated load Et is 
found:

Then, the segment CD in the no-load saturation curve represents exactly Et and OD—the corresponding 
field mmf.
Now we only have to add vectorially to OD the ED in phase with I1n but with its value (in p.u.).
Fan is defined as the ratio between the stator pole rated mmf divided by the field mmf F10n correspond-
ing to rated voltage vn = 1 (p.u.) at no-load.

It is well understood that the whole method could be put into algebraic form and integrated into a 
rather simple computer program that calculates first the no-load saturation curve by advancing in 0.05 
(or so) steps from zero to 130% of rated air gap flux/pole (or no-load voltage). This way, the graphical 
errors are removed to a great extent.
The vectorial addition of field (OD) and armature (DE) mmfs per pole to reach the resultant mmf is 
implicitly valid only if the SG rotor has no magnetic saliency. Even the cylindrical rotor, with slots in 
axis q (only), to house the field coils, has an up to 5% saliency, xdm/xqm = 1.05 under full-load and rated 
power factor.
For the salient pole rotor, the saliency xdm/xqm = 1.3−1.5 and such an approximation is not practical 
anymore.
This is how the partial magnetization curve method becomes necessary.

7.11.2  Partial Magnetization Curve Method
Within the frame of this method, the partial no-load magnetization curves (Figure 7.25) are first deter-
mined point by point up to 1.3 p.u. voltage or (flux).
It is well known that magnetic saturation and saliency produce an angle shifting between the resul-
tant air gap flux and armature and resultant mmf. The cross-coupling magnetic saturation is responsible 
for this phenomenon (Chapter 4).
In Reference 11, a rather lucrative procedure to account for this phenomenon is introduced.
Figure 7.25 shows the phasor diagram similar to Figure 7.24, with Et the rated air gap emf Et = OB¢  = 
OB. To Et, the unsaturated (straight line) Φ1g (Frl) retains the unsaturated

Also, the procedure may be mechanized into a computer program including the calculation of partial 
magnetization curves.

Design of Synchronous Generators
It may be argued that the whole problem may be solved directly through FEM To do so, one needs to 
calculate first Et (from Equation 7.122) must be first calculated, and then with given (rated) stator current 
and assigned values of Ψ to calculate the air gap flux Φ1g must be calculated and then put Φ1g into p.u. 
values and redo the FEM process again with ever new values of Ψ until Φ1g (p.u.) = Et.
The advantage of FEM is the possibility to calculate also the slot leakage inductance. Therefore, only 
the end connection leakage inductance is needed in order to obtain a rather exact value of xls.
Still, FEM seems practical only in the design refinement stages rather than in the general optimiza-
tion design process itself, due to high computation times and lack in generality of results.
Example 7.7:  Rated On-Load Excitation Current
Let us consider the no-load saturation curves in Figure 7.25 as pertaining to a real SG with a 
leakage reactance xsl = 0.11 and a rated power factor angle φn = 20°.
Also the no-load excitation mmf F10n that produces the rated voltage at zero load is (from 
Example 7.5): F10n = 18242 At/pole, SCR = 0.7.
Calculate, for a salient pole rotor τp/τ = 0.7, g/τ = 0.04, with constant air gap, the rated load 
excitation mmf in p.u. and in At/pole.
Solution
First let us apply the Potier diagram method despite of the fact that SG has salient poles. From 
Equation 7.129,

As expected, no reference has been made to the rotor saliency as the Potier diagram method has

which, from the Φ1r(Frr) curves, leads to a rotor mmf Frr ≈ 0.30.
Now Frr is added along the horizontal axis as NR.

The value (2.295) obtained is different from (smaller than) that obtained with Potier diagram 
method (2.68). The three no-load magnetization curves have not been calculated point by point, 
so there is no guarantee of which is better.
However, in terms of precision, it is no doubt that the partial magnetization curves method is 
better, especially as it accounts for cross-coupling saturation and magnetic saliency of the rotor.

In, Vn are the base (rated) RMS values of SG phase current and voltage. Lm represents the air gap induc-

able air gap under rotor poles. The saliency coefficients Kad, Kaq are given in Figure 7.27.

Lsdl—differential (harmonics) leakage.
Let us consider the two-layer winding with rectangular stator slots, so typical for SGs (Figure 7.28).
In general, shorted coils are used, and thus the currents in the upper and lower layer coils are 
dephased by γK (in general, γK = 60° or zero). The angle γK is zero in slots where the same phase occu-
pies both layers.
As both γK = 0° and γK = 60° exist, an average of the slot geometrical permeance is to be used. Lsl may 
be written as [10] follows:

•	 The total geometrical (rather than iron) length of stator l was used—though it includes the radial 
channels length—to account for the “slot leakage” of coil ports corresponding to cooling chan-
nels. It is an overestimation and better approximations are welcome.
•	 Alternative formulae for z permeance ratio have been proposed [11]:

	 Equation 7.141 of λsz produces large errors for small values of g·KC/Wss, which is not the case, in 
general, for SG.

•	 It should be noted that, as for IMs, the solid rotor or the rotor cage may attenuate the 
­differential leakage coefficient λsd and σdso “in exchange” for additional losses in the rotor 
under SG load.
•	 However, as the slot pitch is about the same in the rotor cage and in the stator, and the air gap 
tends to be large, this attenuation is limited. Values of attenuation factor of 0.8–0.5 might be 
expected in special cases.
•	 The end-connection leakage permeance λse depends very much on the exact shape of end connec-
tions, their vicinity to iron (metallic) parts of frame and to the stator stack end plate, and even on 
the value of field mmf (the power factor).
•	 Saturation of stator end core laminations, that produces additional losses in the under excited 
machine, also causes a reduction in end-connection leakage permeance ratio λse, due to induced 
currents effects.
•	 And so do the currents induced in the neighboring metallic parts.

362
Synchronous Generators
•	 Three-dimensional FEM has been used to compute the end-connection leakage flux and losses 
in the end core and in the metallic parts nearby. The results seem satisfactory for the case in the 
point but lack generality.
•	 The case of variable air gap above the rotor pole shoe complicates further the computation of both 
zigzag and differential leakage inductance. As usual, FEM is the solution for refined calculations, 
but in the design preliminary stages the above formulae give results with ±10% error, in general, 
and are fairly reliable.
7.13  Excitation Winding Inductances
As already pointed out in Chapter 4, when reduction to stator is performed, the mutual inductance 
­(reactance) between the field winding and stator phases, Lfa(xfa), equals the d axis magnetization 
­inductance, Lad(xad). However, in the design and in the testing process, it is useful to calculate first the 
main and leakage excitation inductance, before the reduction to stator.
The main field inductance Lfg and the leakage field inductance Lfl make up the excitation total induc-
tance as seen (or measured) from the rotor:

7.15  Solid Rotor Parameters
Cylindrical rotors are built of solid iron and for some salient pole SG also solid rotor poles may be used.
The solid iron of rotor acts as a damper cage with variable resistance and inductance (reactance).
The solid iron parameters depend on the frequency of induced rotor currents—Sf1 for the fundamen-
tal and 2f1 for the inverse components.

366
Synchronous Generators
The presence of field winding slots in the solid iron poles makes the d and q axes equivalent param-
eters of solid iron dampers different from each other and difficult to calculate.
Comprehensive analytical formulae with widespread acceptance for rD, rQ, lDl, lQl for solid iron poles 
are not yet available, but

The trajectory of eddy currents induced by the mmf space harmonics and stator slot opening air gap 
conductance harmonics or during transients depend on the pole pitch of the respective harmonics, the 
frequency as “sensed” by the rotor currents, level of flux density in the rotor solid iron body.
For the mmf fundamental only, the frequency of rotor induced currents is Sf1 (S = (ω1 − ωr)/ω1).

n is number of solid iron rings put together axially to form the rotor (Figure 7.29).
The iron permeability μFe is rather “dictated” by the “steady state” conditions. Therefore, the procedures 
used to calculate the magnetic saturation curves and rated excitation mmf yield also at least an average 
value for μFe. To a first approximation, on the rotor surface, the flux density is, in general, around 1–1.2 T 
in the unslotted region and 1.5–1.8 T in the slotted region of cylindrical rotors. Magnetic saturation leads 
to a decrease in μFe and thus to a larger field penetration depth. That is, to a smaller equivalent rotor-iron 
resistance.
For an unslotted rotor the solid iron resistance reduced to the stator is [10]

All the above parameters appear in the sudden short circuit time response. As the sudden three short 
circuit is used to measure (estimate) the above parameters, their expressions, as derived in the previous 
paragraph, serve for checking the design accuracy and predict the SG transient behavior.
7.16.1  Homopolar Reactance and Resistance
The homopolar sequence (Chapter 4) does not produce interference with the rotor in terms of the funda-
mental. However, it produces a fixed (AC) magnetic field in the air gap with a pole pitch τ3 = τ/3, similar 
to a third space harmonic. Therefore, AC currents are induced in the rotor cage through this AC third 
harmonic field. In general, this effect is neglected, and the homopolar reactance xo is assimilated to a 
stator leakage inductance calculated with slot total currents either zero or twice the homopolar mmf: 
2nc·Io. This is so, as homopolar currents in all phases are all the same.

More complicated expressions are to be found in the literature [6].
It is evident that Equation 7.188 ignores the damping effect of rotor damper induced currents pro-
duced by the homopolar stator mmf. In such conditions, the homopolar resistance ro ≈ rs.

7.17  Electromagnetic Field Time Harmonics
In order to perform well, when connected to the power system, the open-circuit voltage waveform has 
to be very close to a sine wave.
Standards limit the time harmonics traditionally through the so-called telephonic harmonic factor 
(THF): 5% up to 1 MW, 3% up to 5 MW and 1.5% above 5 MW per unit.
Today “grid codes” specify total harmonic distortion (THD) to 1.5% for SGs in near 400 kV power 
systems and 2% in near 275 kV power systems.
There are proposals to raise these limits to 3(3.5)%.
To analyze possibilities to reduce emf THD let us start with its expression:

Therefore, the harmonics occur in the air gap flux density (Bg1) first.
They may be reduced by
•	 Adjusting the ratio of rotor pole shoe span τp per pole pitch τ: αi = τp/τ in salient pole rotors
•	 Varying the air gap from g to gmax from center to margins in the salient pole rotor shoe
•	 Adjusting the large (central) tooth τp per pole pitch τ ratio in nonsalient pole rotors with uniform 
air gap

caused solely by the air gap flux density harmonics, is obtained in the first case (salient poles) for 
αp = τp/τ = 0.77–0.8. However, these large values produce too large interpole excitation flux leakage 
and αi ≈ 0.7 is practiced; occasionally larger.
For the nonsalient poles τp/τ ≈ 1/3 seems adequate, but the precise ratio τp/τ may be used to destroy 
a certain harmonic ν:

As even harmonics do not normally occur (all poles geometry, air gap, and excitation coils are identical), 
the harmonics of interest are ν = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ….
The first slot-opening-caused harmonic pair νc = 6q ± 1 may also be the target, especially, with inte-
ger q < 5.

A notable reduction in the fifth and seventh harmonics is obtained. The augmentation of the third 
harmonic is not a problem in three-phase machine (Table 7.2).
In reality, air gap variation under pole shoes is done through lower radius rotor pole machining. FEM 
should be used to quantify the “exact” effect on air gap flux harmonics.
Next step in reduction emf harmonics is the proper design of the stator winding. One solution is the 
reducing of Kdν and(or) Kyν for key harmonics.
An increase in integer q above 5 does not produce a notable decrease in Kdn
n
(
) ³5, not to mention Kd3 
which is almost independent of q and large (around 0.67). But q = 2, 3 produces significantly higher har-
monics. The worst situation, Kd c
n =1, takes place for the slot harmonics νc = 6Kq ± 1.
Raising the order of the first slot harmonics implies larger integer q (q ≥ 5) or fractionary q = b + c/d = 
(bd + c)/d. In this case, the first slot harmonic is νc = 6 (bd + c) ± 1.
One more way to reduce the emf harmonics is to cancel (reduce) the fifth and seventh harmonics by 
two-layer windings with chorded coils:

A coil chording of about 5/6 may be obtained easily with a large q.
The third harmonic has to be kept below 5% of the fundamental to avoid false tripping of relays for 
differential protection when an SG is connected or disconnected to/from a bus bar, with both systems 
earthed to allow for triple frequency currents to flow to ground through neutral points.
It should be mentioned that the stator mmf harmonics due to the location of stator coils in slots pro-
duces mmf harmonics of orders ν = 6K ± 1, that is, −5, +7, −11, +13. These space harmonics do not produce 
time harmonics in the emf but produce additional losses in the rotor. This is why they have to be reduced 
through increased or fractionary q.
7.18  Slot Ripple Time Harmonics
In certain conditions, the air gap permeance variation due to slot openings may produce higher har-
monics, known as slot ripple, in the open-circuit emf wave.
It is the stator slot opening air gap magnetic permeance in interaction to the field mmf fundamental 
that produces the slot ripple emf effect (Figure 7.30):

Design of Synchronous Generators
For ν = 1, the first air gap permeance harmonic is considered; while for ν1 = 2, the second one comes into 
play. Both are important.
If the rotor damper bar pitch τd corresponds to a division of circle by Ns − p1 or Ns + p1, then the cur-
rents induced by the flux density pulsation due to ν1 = 1 in the rotor bars are zero.
This is why τs = τr (stator slot pitch ≈ damper bar pitch) produces good results.
In addition, with a complete end-ring, rotor damper bar induced currents may flow between adjacent poles if

(7.206)
Such a condition may be met by displacing the groups of bars on each pole from the center line such that 
the displacement of cage bars between adjacent poles should be 1/2 stator slot pitch.
Now if Ns/p1 ratio is an odd number, condition of Equation 7.206 is fulfilled automatically.
Not so far, the second slot harmonic (ν1 = 2) when 2Ns/p1 = even number.
With Ws/ge > 2 and Wt/Ws >1.5, the second permeance harmonic may be large. To avoid the slot ripple 
mmf for ν1 = 2, this simply means choosing the rotor bars pitch, τd to be half the stator slot pitch τs. When 
there would seem to be too many rotor bars, skewing the stator slots by one-half slot pitch might be the 
solution.
Fractionary q tends to eliminate slot ripple influence on the mmf, with τs ≈ τr.
Note: While the above rationale produces intuitive suggestions to reduce emf time harmonics, their 
verification is now possible using FEM.
7.19  Losses and Efficiency
Four main categories of losses occur in SGs:
•	 Winding (copper) losses
•	 Core (iron) losses
•	 Mechanical losses
•	 Brush-ring electrical losses

374
Synchronous Generators
The winding (copper) losses include stator winding losses and excitation (plus exciter losses if the exciter 
is mounted on the SG shaft) losses.
Core (iron) losses include the stator core fundamental (50(60) Hz) hysteresis, eddy current losses, and 
additional core losses.
Additional core losses are produced both by the field winding mmf (under no-load, also):
•	 On the rotor surface
•	 On the stator end laminations stacks, in the tightening plate and, by the stator mmf space har-
monics, again on the rotor core surface
Another way of classifying the electromagnetic losses is to consider them as no-load losses and short-
circuit losses (at given current). Such a division of losses corresponds to practical tests on SGs where such 
losses may be measured.
Therefore, despite the fact that there are notable differences between short circuit and full load in 
terms of magnetic saturation, the combination of no-load and short-circuit losses proves to be rather 
adequate in industry.
There are approximate analytical expressions to calculate the various components of no-load and 
short-circuit losses that have stood the test of time in industry [13].
In parallel, FEM has been recently applied to calculate various components of losses in SGs.
At least for rotor surface losses, it has been recently proved that analytical methods [14] correlate very 
well with FEM results [15].
7.19.1  No-Load Core Losses of Excited SGs
The no-load core losses of SG consist of the following:
•	 Fundamental stator core hysteresis losses, ph
•	 Eddy current losses, pedo
•	 Additional rotor pole shoe losses, ppso
•	 Additional stator core losses in the lamination stacks peFe10
There are also additional “core” losses in the stator tightening end plates or pressure fingers and in the 
axial stator bolts that tighten the stator stack, but these are relatively smaller in a proper design.
The fundamental stator core losses PFe10 are

where pho and pedo are the specific hysteresis and, respectively, eddy current losses in 1 kg of lamination 
at 1.0 T and 50 Hz, and G is the weight of laminations material.
As known, the flux density B is far from uniform in the stator teeth or yoke; still an average has to be 
considered in Equation 7.207.
Even Equation 7.207 is a bit impractical as it needs separation of hysteresis and eddy current losses, 
which is not directly available in single-frequency tests.

Bt1/30—tooth flux density at 30% slot height.
Ky1 and Kt1 are empirical factors allowing for loss augmentation due to machining the laminations 
(Ky1 ≈ 1.3–1.6, Kt1 ≈ 1.8–2.4). Gy1, Gt1 are the stator yoke and teeth weights. Finally, p10 is the specific losses 
(in W/kg) at 1.0 T and 50 Hz.
When FEM flux distribution is calculated, it is possible to consider the instantaneous values of flux 
density in each volume element and to add up the losses in these elements.
Still, as the machining factors are so important FEM results in core losses have not yet produced 
spectacular results in terms of precision over analytical expressions that have been corrected overtime, 
based on industrial experience.
Though it is known that for same frequency and flux density the specific iron losses (in W/kg) differ 
in AC and traveling fields, p10 is still obtained from AC field measurements. At least in the stator yoke, 
the field is mainly of traveling character.
Therefore, one more open question remains here: Is it worth and how to consider the traveling field 
and AC field loss regions when determining the stator core losses?
The rotor surface no-load losses ppso are produced by the field current caused air gap flux density 
variation on the rotor pole surface due to stator slot openings.
The frequency of currents induced on the rotor surface is fps = Ns·n, where n is the rotor speed.
To reduce these losses, the pole shoes are made, whenever possible, from 1 to 1.8  mm thick 
laminations.
However, in turbogenerators and in high-speed hydrogenerators the rotors are made of solid iron.
In this case, large air gap g per stator slot opening Wss ratios (g/Wss ≥ 1) are adopted to secure low flux 
density pulsations due to slot opening, and thus moderate pole surface losses result.
Though the situation differs to some extent in salient pole, in contrast to cylindrical pole, rotors, gen-
eral analytical expressions have been proposed:

Bgo—no-load air gap flux density [T]
τs—stator slot pitch [m]
Apole—rotor pole shoe area [m2]
Ns—number of stator slots
n—rotor speed in rps
This expression is hardly valid for solid rotor poles when the depth of field penetration is dependent 
not only on the frequency (Ns·n) but also on flux density level (due to magnetic saturation).
As the stator mmf space harmonics also produce eddy currents on the surface of rotor solid poles, we 
will treat this case in the paragraph on short-circuit (load) losses.

7.19.2  No-Load Losses in the Stator Core End Stacks
As can be seen in Figure 7.31, a part of air gap excitation flux paths close through the rotor pole tighten-
ing plates. If the latter are long enough, the flux lines meet the end-stack laminations in the stator at 90°. 
Consequently, the lamination effect does not work anymore and considerable iron losses are produced 
in the end-stacks.
Stepping the air gap in the end-stack reduces these losses to some extent.
Considering that both the stator and the rotor surfaces are magnetically equipotential, the flux densi-
ties Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, corresponding to the air gaps g1, g2, g3 are

The teeth may be splitted in the middle, radially, and then Wta = Wt1/2 and thus the end-stack 
core losses are notably reduced. The lamination resistivity, ρlam ≈ 0.5 × 10−6 Ω m and increases with

The coefficient KR > 1 accounts for the frequency (skin) effect on stator resistance.
By design in general KR < 1.33 even in large power SGs. In large power SGs, to keep KR less than 1.33, 
Roebel bar single-turn windings are used.
In Roebel bars, the single turn, divided into many elementary conductors in parallel, uses their trans-
position along the stack length such that all of them occupy all positions within the turn location and 
thus the circulation currents between elementary conductors is zero.
With the circulating currents made zero through transposition, the skin effect coefficient KR is the 
same as for the elementary conductors in series (same current in all of them):

With some slots hosting same phase and some different phases, a kind of average value for KRa has 
to be calculated. Note that for the slots hosting, the same phase in both winding layers, the number of 
elementary conductor layers is 2nl in Equation 7.216.
The skin effect tends to be much smaller in the end-connection, and even without transposition in 
this zone, the skin effect coefficient is smaller than in the stack (slot) zone.
To secure KRa ≤ 1.33, the radial size h1 of the elementary conductor in the Roebel bar has to be limited.
With the usual number of elementary conductor layers nl going up to 12, even more, ξ has to be 
smaller than unity ξ < 1.

For example, for the number of elementary conductors nl = 16 per bar, hbar = 15 mm × 
16 = 60 mm , 
h1 = 15/4 = 3.5 mm.
With two layers in the windings, the total copper height is 2hbar = 120 mm. Considering all insulation 
layers, the total slot height could reach up to 200 mm. As slot width Ws ≤ (30–40) mm, it means that for 
the usual hslot/Ws < 6.5.
Most of practical cases can be handled by Roebel bars up to highest power per unit (2100 MVA at 28 kV 
line voltage).
In reality, the number of elementary conductor layers may be increased to 48 when their radial height 
goes down to almost 2 mm, so even deeper slots may be allowed once conditions of Equations 7.222 and 
7.223 are met.
Note that there are many other formulae corresponding to cases different from Roebel bar (character-
ized by the zero circulating currents).

rotor poles or in damper windings.
This attention of B3~ is not considered either.

Design of Synchronous Generators
It is recommended here to check, whenever possible, the flux density values in the air gap and in the 
solid rotor via FEM eddy current software, in order to secure, by fudge factors, good estimation level of 
rotor surface losses.
Negative sequence currents (limited by standards too) may also produce in solid rotor poles with 
smaller air gap surface rotor additional losses due to slot opening. Such losses may be reduced by damper 
cages but at the cost of higher excitation current (and losses), to produce the ideal emf value [16].
For special (rated) operation modes FEM may be used directly.
Additional losses occur in the stator tightening plates made of solid metal and in the teeth pres-
sure fingers. There are again traditional analytical expressions for these losses [6]; but after FEM 
investigations, it seems that their use should be made with extreme care. The total short-circuit

In case of static exciter, ηex is the static exciter efficiency. For a brushless exciter, the brush and slip-

7.19.7  Mechanical Losses
Mechanical losses may be approximated to losses at no-load, with the SG unexcited (I1 = If = 0):
•	 Bearing losses (axial and guidance bearings in vertical axial SGs)
•	 Ventilation losses (in the ventilator, its circuit, and shaft air friction)
When pumps are used, in direct hydrogen or water cooling, their input power has to be considered 
also.

Knowing all steady-state machine parameters, for each value of output power and cos φ, stator and 
field currents may be calculated after the power angle δV is determined along the way (Chapter 4). With 
losses calculated as in previous paragraphs, the total losses and efficiency at different load levels may be 
predetermined to assess the design goodness from this crucial viewpoint.
Note: In direct cooling SGs, the winding losses tend to dominate the losses in the machine, while for 
indirect cooling the nonwinding losses tend to be predominant.
It follows that for indirect cooling, the efficiency tends to be maximum above rated load and below rated 
load for direct cooling.

7.20  Exciter Design Issues
The excitation system supplies the SG field current to control either the terminal voltage or the reactive 
power to set point.
As already detailed in Chapter 6, the excitation system is provided with protective limiters.
For operation tied to weak power systems, power system stabilizers (PSS) are used to damp the oscil-
lations in the range from 0.5 Hz to 2 ÷ 5 Hz.
The specification of excitation systems is guided by IEEE standards 421 [17]. There are two key factors 
that define an excitation system: the transient gain and the ceiling forcing ratio (maximum/rated voltage 
at SG excitation winding terminal).
The transient gain has a direct impact on small signal and dynamic stability.
Too a small transient gain may fail to give the desired performance, while too a high transient gain 
produces faster response but may result in dynamic instability during faults. In this latter case, the PSS 
may have to be considered.
The transient gain refers to frequency of generator oscillations in the range of a few tenth of Hz to a 
few Hz.
Traditionally, excitation system controllers consist of a high steady-state gain to secure low steady-
state control error and a lag-lead compensator to provide transient gain reduction.
In today’s digital control systems PI, PID, or more advanced controllers such as Fuzzy Logic, H∞, and 
sliding-mode are used.
Steady-state gains of 200 p.u. provide for ±0.5% steady-state regulation.
Transient gains vary in general from 20 to 100 with lower values for weak power systems, to avoid 
local mode power system oscillations (in 1–2 Hz range).
The excitation system ceiling voltage has also an impact on transient stability.
For static excitation systems 160%–200% of rated field voltage is set for design, to preserve stability 
after the clearing of a three-phase fault on the higher voltage side of the SG step-up transformer.
As lowering the SCR seems the trend in SG design today, to increase SG efficiency, increasing 
the excitation voltage ceiling becomes the pertinent option, to preserve transient stability desired 
performance.
The three-phase fault critical time (CCT), for constant ceiling forcing, decreases when the SCR 
decreases, both for lagging and for leading power factor. For leading power factor, however, the CCT is 
even smaller.
The required field voltage ceiling ratio thus has to be specified after critical clearing time limits are 
checked for lagging and leading power factor for the actual power system area where the SG will work. 
Such a local system is characterized by the % reactance looking out from the SG: 10% is a strong system 
and 40% is already a weak system.
Practical limits of ceiling (maximum) voltage is about 500 VDC in general. But this maximum voltage 
may correspond to a 3 p.u. ceiling voltage ratio.
AC brushless exciters might allow smaller ceiling voltage ratio as they are less affected by power sys-
tem faults.
In respect to exciter design we will treat here only the AC brushless exciter as it comprises two syn-
chronous generators of smaller power rating.
An alternative brushless exciter, operational from zero speed, is made of wound rotor induction 
machine whose rotor winding output is diode rectified and supplies the SG excitation, while its stator 
winding is supplied at variable (controlled) voltage through a thyristor voltage amplitude controller 
(Figure 7.35b).
The frequency f2 of the voltage induced in the AC exciter rotor is f2 = f1 + n·p1ex and increases with 
speed, above f1 = 50(60) Hz.
As the induced rotor voltage amplitude V2 also tends to increase with f2, when speed increases, the 
voltage V1 in the stator has to be reduced through adequate control.

387
Design of Synchronous Generators
At zero speed, all the power transmitted to the SG excitation comes from the exciter’s stator; it is 
electrical, in other words.
As the speed increases, more and more of the excitation power comes from the shaft, especially with 
increasing the number of exciter’s pole pair number p1exc > 3.
The induction exciter voltage response is expected to be rather fast. However, the exciter stator wind-
ing has to deliver the whole power of SG excitation, should it be needed at zero speed as in the case of 
pump storage plant.
The induction exciter is used in industry also.
A typical AC brushless exciter contains a PM synchronous pilot exciter whose output is electronically 
controlled after rectification to supply the DC excitation of the inside-out synchronous exciter whose 
diode rectified output (with the rectification on the rotor) is connected directly to the excitation circuit 
of the SG (Figure 7.35a).
This way, neither brushes nor an additional power source is involved. However, if faster response is 
needed, the excitation circuit of the pilot exciter may be supplied directly from a separate power source 
through power electronics whose control variable is the output of the SG excitation control.
The pilot PM alternator is designed for frequency in the range of (180–450) Hz to cut the recti-
fied output voltage pulsations. Also, the AC exciter is designed with a rather large number of poles 
2p1 = 6–8, again to secure a rated armature frequency higher than 100 Hz, and thus low pulsations 
in the field winding current and small volume of the AC exciter magnetic circuit (armature yoke, 
especially).

winding voltage Vf is

The voltage regulation of the diode rectifier in SG excitation circuit is neglected.
If better precision is needed, rectifier voltage regulation has to be considered, as in Figure 6.33.

Synchronous Generators
The AC exciter should be available to produce the ceiling voltage Vfmax at the SG excitation terminals, 
but also, during steady state, to allow for the Ifn (the rated load excitation current that corresponds to 
rated SG output power and power factor).
Besides rated and maximum field voltage and current ratings Vfn, Ifn for steady state and Vfmax, Ifmax for 
transients, the AC exciter has to provide a certain response time in providing the ceiling voltage Vfmax 
from the rated value Vfn.
Equally important, the excitation system has to have high efficiency at moderate weight and costs and 
be reliable. Here, a general design method for a brushless AC exciter is detailed. Optimization design 
issues will be treated later in this chapter for the SG in general.
7.20.1  Excitation Rating
As already alluded to, the AC exciter rating is given by Vfn, In, for steady state, and Vfmax, Ifmax for transients.
The exciter response time is also specified. The SG may be required to operate at rated MVA for 105% 
terminal voltage. As in such a case, the magnetic saturation level in the SG increases notably, the con-
tinuous power rating of the AC exciter will increase more than +5%.
Sometimes, the exciters have redundant circuitry.
The voltage response time (VRT) is the time in seconds for the excitation voltage to travel 95% the 
difference between Vfmax and Vfn (Figure 7.36).
Today’s AC exciter systems are required to have VRT < 100 ms under full field current load.
7.20.2  Sizing the Exciter
Sizing the exciter is very similar to that of the main SG as already developed in this chapter. There are 
some peculiarities, as in Reference [18].
The reduction in VRT leads to severe limitation in the AC exciter subtransient reactance ¢xd below 
0.3. It may also be needed to provide for a rather strong cage in its stator to reduce the commutation 
reactance x   x   x
c

(
) 2 in the diode rectifier for lower voltage regulation and allowance for higher 
rated frequency (low yoke height).
As a good part of ¢xd is the armature leakage inductance, reducing the latter is paramount. Wide and 
not-so-deep armature slots and short end-connections (chorded coils) are practical ways of achieving 
this goal. The leakage inductance of the AC exciter circuit has to be reduced, and star connection of AC 
exciter armature phases is preferred, in order to eliminate the third harmonic current and thus avoid 
limitations on coil span. It also requires a smaller number of slots (with two turns/slot) for same output 
DC voltage Vfn.
A smaller number of slots means lower manufacturing costs.
Two or more current paths in parallel may be necessary to produce the required Vfmax (Vfn).

7.20.3  Note on Thermal and Mechanical Design
Thus far, the various no-load and load losses have been calculated. To remove the heat produced by 
losses, it is necessary to adopt and design appropriate cooling systems.
As already mentioned, SG cooling may be indirect—with air or hydrogen and direct (with water or 
hydrogen). Evaporative cooling is getting ground, also. There are many specific solutions as the power 
and speed (in rpm) goes up.
Analytical models are used in general for thermal design but FEM is more and more used for the 
scope.
The same rationale is valid for the mechanical design.
As the thermal and mechanical limitations observation influences the machine reliability and safety, 
their summarily treatment is not to be accepted. A detailed such analysis, on the other hand, needs rich 
space. This is why we stop here, drawing attention to specialized design books [5,6] while noticing that 
all manufacturers have their proprietary thermal design methods for SGs.
Forces, noise, and vibration are another important issues in the SG design. See for starters [6,19].
7.21  Optimization Design Issues
Thus far, we did present analytical expressions to do the dimensioning of an SG that fulfills given speci-
fications. Also, the computation of resistances, inductances, and losses has been investigated.
Finally, the cost of active materials may be computed.
This process may be described as the general design and computer programs may be produced to 
mechanize it.
The general design produces a realistic (feasible) SG. It is a good starting point for optimization design.
Optimization design requires the following:
•	 An initial practical design
•	 A machine model to calculate the parameters and performance (and objective functions) for 
given geometry and various design parameters
•	 A set of design variables such as the following:
	
1.	 Stator bore diameter: Dis
	
2.	 Slot width: Wss
	
3.	 Slot/tooth width ratio: Wss/Wt
	
4.	 A (A/m)—stator current loading
	
5.	 W/m2—stator surface loading
	
6.	 Flux density in stator teeth: Bts
	
7.	 Flux density in stator yoke: Bys
	
8.	 Flux density in the rotor pole body: Bp
	
9.	 Thickness of field coil: Wc
	
10.	 W/m2 rotor surface loading
For each variable, the minimum and maximum values are set:
•	 A single- or multiple-cost function, such that generator costs plus the loss capitalized costs, is a 
way of accomodating various constraints (i.e., ¢ <
¢
X
X
d
dmax, various temperature limitations, and 
SCR < SCR max) through penalty terms added to the cost function (Figure 7.37).
•	 A mathematical method (or more) to search for the optimal design [20] that produces the lowest 
cost function, observing the constraints and being able to deal with some design variables that are 
integer numbers (number of slots Ns, number of turns in the coil, etc.).
•	 There is a plethora of optimization methods of linear and nonlinear programming, indirect and 
direct, with constraints, deterministic, stochastic, and evolutionary.

390
Synchronous Generators
Such a complete optimization design software, with long use, based on Monte-Carlo optimization 
method is described in Reference 21.
More recently, evolution strategies and genetic algorithms have been applied to optimization sub-
design of SGs. By subdesign, we mean here a partial problem in design such as the modification of rotor 
pole or of stator slot geometry to minimize losses and production costs [22].
When the cost (objective) function may not be stated in terms of a scalar type function Pareto optimal 
sets are used.
Pareto sets contain a number of solutions (designs) that are equivalent to each other in terms of trade-
offs, that are so common in SG design.
Finding Pareto optimal sets of solutions to the problem, with stator slot and rotor pole dimensions as 
design variables, and losses and production costs to be simultaneously minimized, constitutes such an 
optimization subdesign problem in SGs.
For such a problem, the design variables could be as follows:
•)>> Geometry and number of copper strands
•)>> Dimensions of rotor pole
•)>> Dimensions of field coil
•)>> Pitch and diameter of damper cage bars
•)>> The air gap

Evolutionary methods algorithms of optimization become necessary in nonsmooth and model-based 
objective (cost) functions. This is the case for SGs.
Figure 7.38 [22] shows the Pareto front (squares and line), with the initial solution (solid circles), while 
the other points are dominated solutions.
Two simultaneous goals—minimum cost and minimum losses (5000 $/KW of losses)—have been 
followed in this case.
The G.A. have been proved to produce better results [20] than other evolutionary strategies.

7.21.1  Optimal Design of a Large Wind Generator by Hooke–Jeeves Method
Directly driven DC-excited synchronous wind-generators have been considered recently for 7.6 MW at 
11.7 rpm, 400 V line voltage.
The machine model for design is nonlinear analytical one as developed in previous chapters.
There are 11 variables as in Table 7.1.
The objective function is complex as it contains terms such as initial (active materials) cost, loss 
energy capitalized cost, and overtemperature penalty cost (which has to be zero for the optimal solu-
tion): a simplified thermal model of the machine with an equivalent thermal transmissivity coefficient 
in W/(m2 °C) is also introduced.
The modified Hooke–Jeeves optimization method is deterministic [20], and thus the probability to 
reach a global optimum is enhanced by starting the process from 15 to 20 different random initial vari-
able vector values. When quite a few optimal results are very close, it means that most probably a global 
optimum was reached.
As the voltage is rather small, the number of current paths a = 2p (number of poles), in order to use 
thin wire in making the coils, though circulatory currents between current paths (due to machine inher-
ent/fabrication small asymmetries) have to be considered, though.
Being an integer, even number 2p is not included in the optimization variable vector; therefore, the opti-
mization routine is run for a few chosen values of 2p = 140, 160, 180, 200, 220. A large number of poles lead in 
general to better efficiency and lower weight, but it also leads to a larger outer diameter of rotor (Figure 7.39).
A few optimal design results are shown in Table 7.3.
In general, 40 iterations are enough to obtain a final solution, while the computation time on a con-
temporary desktop is a few tens of seconds.
From Table 7.3, as a compromise, we may choose solution 4, because of lower outer stator diameter 
(12 m, as in [23]).
The variation of efficiency versus load current in p.u. for the optimal solution is shown in Figure 7.40, 
for various load characters (power factors).
As the analytical/nonlinear model, though complex (including cross-coupling load-saturation) may 
not guarantee that the optimal solutions with calculated (id, iq, iF, power angle δV) can actually pro-
duce the rated average torque, FEM validation is mandatory. Besides, no-load air gap flux density 
average value and αd and Lq inductance for rated power conditions should also be FEM calculated, for 
validation.

Synchronous Generators
If errors larger than 3%–5% are perceived, fudge coefficients should be added in no-load air gap flux den-
sity formula, in electromagnetic torque and in Ld and Lq expressions (in an underrelaxed manner), and thus 
the FEM may be integrated (embedded) in the optimization loop. For a reasonable (101 s) computation time 
increase, a satisfactory solution is obtained without complicating too much the nonlinear analytical model.
As an example of FEM validation, the radial component of air gap flux density at no-load/rated 
­voltage and for full load are shown in Figure 7.41.
A notable armature reaction is visible, as “dictated” by the initial cost reduction strong aim in the opti-
mization function. A compromise between initial cost and loss capitalized cost (rather than efficiency) 
was observed in the optimal design case study of this directly driven large synchronous wind generator.
7.21.2  Magnetic Equivalent Circuit Population–Based 
Optimal Design of Synchronous Generator
Magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) methods (model and mesh based) have been introduced to consider 
magnetic saturation more locally but also slotting, in order to calculate flux density distribution in elec-
tric machines with acceptable precision, but at a computation time at least 10 times smaller than with 
coupled-circuit–field (in full) finite element methods (FEMs) [8,24,25].

Design of Synchronous Generators
A mesh-based MEC optimal design methodology of SG that uses a population-based (evolutionary) 
optimization algorithm is introduced in Reference 25.
Typical cross-section geometrical data and the MEC used—in the mesh variant, as it saves notable com-
putation time—are shown in Figure 7.42a and b. Not less than 17 “genes”, or variables, are used (Table 7.4).
The optimization is run for two distinct fitting functions:
)>>
fit1 = − mass;  fit2 = −ploss)>>
(7.258)
The sign (−) in Equation 7.258 is required if (already well tested) the genetic algorithm optimal design 
toolbox GOSET—Matlab is applied, as the latter looks for “maximae” and not “minimae” constraints 
are added also and, for a 2 kW Diesel engine small SG at 3600 rpm, the total computation time for one 
optimal solution is claimed to be in the 5 s range.
Constraints on SG design and loss (W)—mass (kg) Pareto—fronts are shown in Table 7.5 and in 
Figure 7.43.
A distinct merit of MEC analytical model, besides better local flux density calculation, is the possibil-
ity to calculate not only the average torque but also the torque pulsations as well.
Still the cross-coupling saturation and more involved machine geometry and windings require very 
skilled designers, capable of producing MEC for such cases.
And, anyway, FEM verifications are required.
More so with thermal and mechanical design constraints.
Therefore, the question arises: should we put more and more talent/time in developing ever more 
refined (MEC or other) nonlinear analytical model for optimal design, to reduce computation time, 
or we better invest more time in efficiently embedding FEM either at the end of optimization cycle to 
reduce errors in key performance indexes (no-load voltage, torque, Ld, Lq under critical load conditions) 
which lead to correction factors in the less-refined analytical model?
For PMSMs, already, the analytical model was replaced by limited (smart) FEM usage, for sinusoidal 
time/space distributions, in evolutionary multiobjective optimal design recent codes.
This path may be good also for SG optimal design.

Pump-storage is used in some hydropower plants to replenish the water in the forebay each day and then 
deliver electric power during the peak demand hours.
During the pumping mode, the SG acts as a motor. To start such a large power motor, even on no-
load, a pony motor has been traditionally used. It is also practical to use the back-to-back generator and 
motor starting when a unit works as a generator and, during its acceleration to speed, it supplies a motor 
unit and the two machines advance synchronously to the rated synchronous speed.
A single generator may supply one after the other all pump-storage units. Induction—motor—mode 
starting with self-synchronization is also feasible, at reduced voltage for large power units.
As the friction torque may be reduced, by refined high-pressure oil bearings, to less than 1% of rated torque, 
the power required to start the motor, with the water—less turbine—pump, has been notably reduced.
It is thus feasible to use a lower relative power rating static power converter to start the motor and 
disconnect the converter after the motor has been self-synchronized.
An SG designed to be used also as a motor for water pump storage undergoes about one start a day as 
a motor and one synchronization a day as a generator.

Synchronous Generators
Self-synchronization for motoring and automatic synchronization for generation imply notable tran-
sients in currents and torque, and the machine has to be designed to withstand such demanding conditions.
Typically, the direction of motion is changed for motoring as required by the turbine-pump. High 
wicket gate water leakage may cause the “waterless” unit to start rotating still in the generator direction. 
To avoid the transients that the static power converter would incur in initiating the starting as a motor, 
the machine has to be stalled before beginning to accelerate it on no-load, in the motoring direction.
Asynchronous self-starting is used for low- and medium-power units, albeit using a step-down auto-
transformer or a variable reactor to reduce starting currents. For units above 20 MW pony motor, gen-
erator–motor back-to-back or static power converter starting should be used.
The development of multiple-level voltage source converters with IGBTs (up to 4.5 MW/unit) [22] and 
with GTOs or MCTs (up to 10 MW/unit and above) [27] might change the picture.
For the low power range (up to 3 MW), it is possible to use a bidirectional voltage—source IGBT converter, 
designed at generator–motor rating, that will not only allow startup for the motoring but also provide for 
generating and motoring at variable speed (to exploit optimally the turbine-pump). It is known that the opti-
mal speed ratio between pumping and turbining is about 1.24. For high power, the multilevel voltage source 
GTO and MCT converters may replace the controlled rectifier current source converters that are used today 
[24] to accelerate pump-storage units (above 20 MW or so) and then self-synchronize them to the power grid.
The multilevel PWM back-to-back IGBT, GTO, MCT converters provide quality starting while 
inflicting lower harmonics both on the power line and on the motor side (Figure 7.44a and b). They are 
smaller inside and provide controllable (unity) power factor on the line side.

Synchronous Generators
As there is a step-up transformer between the static power converter and the machine, the starting 
cannot be initiated from zero frequency but from 1 to 2 Hz. This will cause transients that explain the 
necessary oversizing of the static power converter for the scope.
It goes without saying that to start the motor as a synchronous motor, a static exciter is required 
because full excitation is needed from 1 to 2 Hz speed. The static converters might be controlled for 
asynchronous starting (up to a certain speed), and thus their kVA ratings have to be increased.
Note that the “ideal” solution for pump storage is the doubly fed induction–generator motor that will 
be studied in Variable Speed Generators.
7.23  Summary
•	 By SG design, we mean here dimensioning to match given specifications of performance with 
constraints.
•	 Specifying SGs to be connected to power system is object of standardization. The proposed con-
solidated C 50.12, C 50.13 ANSI standards are typical for the scope.
•	 Besides manufacturers’ standard, grid codes have been issued to tailor SG performance for power 
system typical and extreme operation modes. There may be conflicts between those two kinds of 
specifications and mitigation efforts are required to harmonize them.
•	 The first specification item is the SCR—the ratio between the short circuit and ratio current or the 
inverse of d-axis synchronous reactance in p.u. (1/xdsat).
A larger SCR requires a larger air gap and, finally, a larger excitation mmf and losses, while it increases 
the peak power and thus the static stability.
As the transmission line reactive xc at generator terminals increases, the beneficial effect of a larger 
SCR on static stability diminishes. A large xc characterizes a weak power system.
Today’s trend is to reduce SCR to 0.4–0.6 while the static stability is preserved by the ever-faster 
response of contemporary exciter systems.
•	 Stand-alone SGs are to be designed with higher SCR to secure reasonable voltage regulation with 
0.8–0.9 lagging power factor loads.
•	 The second specification issue is the transient reactance ¢xd that influences the transient ­stability. 
The smaller the ¢xd , the better, but there are limits to it due to machine geometry required to pro-
duce the design power.
•	 Rated power factor is essential in SG design: the lower the rated power factor, the larger the excita-
tion power. In general, cos φn: 0.9–0.95 (overexcited).
•	 The maximum absorbed (leading) reactive power limit is determined by the SCR and corresponds 
to maximum power angle and (or) to stator end-core temperature limit.
•	 Fast control of excitation current is required to preserve SG stability and control the terminal 
voltage. Today’s ceiling voltage ratio for excitation systems is 1.6–3.0. The limit is, in fact, deter-
mined by the heavy saturation of SG magnetic circuit. A response time of 50 ms “producing” 
the maximum ceiling voltage is required to qualify the response of excitation system as fast. 
Even with brushless rotary-machine configurations such a response is feasible. Static exciters 
are faster.
•	 Voltage and frequency variations are limited to contain the saturation level in the SG. A ± 2%–3% 
in both should be provided at rated power. Higher values are to be accepted for a limited amount 
of time to avoid SG overheating. These requirements are standardized or agreed upon between 
manufacturers and users.
•	 Negative phase-sequence voltages and currents are limited by standards to limit rotor damper 
cage and excitation additional losses (and overtemperatures).

399
Design of Synchronous Generators
Negative sequence voltage is limited to about 1% (V2/V1%), while the current negative sequence i2/i1 may 
reach 4%–5% or more depending on the SG negative sequence reactance x2 plus the step-up transformer 
short-circuit reactance xT.
•)>> Total voltage harmonic distortion (THD) limits are prescribed by grid codes to 1.5%–2%, with 
proposals to raise it to 3%–3.5% in the future.
•)>> Temperature basis for rating power is paramount in SG design. It is between observable and hot-
spot temperature. The observable temperature limit is set such that the hot-spot temperature is 
below 130°C for Class B and 155° for Class C insulation systems. The rated coolant temperature 
should also be specified. As the cold coolant temperature varies for ambient—following SGs, it 
seems reasonable to fix the observable temperature limit for a single cold-coolant temperature 
and ­calculate the SG MVA capability for different ambient temperatures.
The hot-spot temperature too will vary.
As the ambient temperature goes up, the SG MVA capability goes down.
•)>> Start–stop cycles have to be specified to prevent cyclic fatigue degradation. For base load SG, 3,000 
starts are typical, while 10,000 starts are characteristic to peaking-load or other frequently cycled units.
•)>> Starting and operation as a motor (in pump storage units) faulty synchronizations, forces, arma-
ture voltage, runaway speed ratio all have to be specified in a pertinent design.
•)>> The design process consists in sizing the SG in relation to the aforementioned specifications. The 
design refers to electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical aspects. Only electromagnetic design 
has been followed in detail in this chapter.
The electromagnetic design essentially comprises the following:
•)>> The output coefficient stator geometry
•)>> The selection of number of stator slots
•)>> The design of stator core and winding
•)>> The sizing of salient pole rotors
•)>> The sizing of cylindrical pole rotors
•)>> Open circuit saturation curve computation
•)>> Stator leakage reactance and resistance computation
•)>> Field mmf (current) at full load
•)>> Computation of synchronous reactances xd, xq
•)>> Sizing of damper cage
•)>> Computation of time constants and transient, subtrasient reactances
•)>> Exciter design
•)>> Generator/motor design issues
•)>> Optimization design issues
•)>> The output coefficient C (min kVA/m3) is defined as the SG kVA per m3. It is a result of accumulated 
experience (art) and varies with the power/pole, number of poles pairs and type of cooling system.
The rotor diameter D is computed basically based on runaway speed Umax, with given SG synchronous 
speed and number of pole pairs p1, for given frequency.
The rotor inertia H (s) has to be above a limit value such that to limit the maximum speed of SG upon 
loss of electric load, until the speed governor closes the fuel (water) input (unless special fast braking is 
provided as is the case of turbo generators).
•)>> SGs may have integer or fractionary two-layer windings. We refer to q slots/pole/phase as integer 
or fractionary. Turbogenerators (2p1 = 2, 4) use integer q windings in general (q > 5–6), while 
hydrogenerators today have fractionary windings.

400
Synchronous Generators
•	 The choice of q determines the number of slots Ns of stator as Ns = 6⋅p1q. The selection of q also 
depends on the number of lamination segments Nc that constitute the stator core and on the num-
ber of detachable sections NK in which the core may be divided and wound separately due to the 
large diameters considered:
	
NK = 2  for D < 4 m
	
NK = 4  for D = 4–8 m
	
NK = 6(8)  for D > 8 m
•	 It is imperative that all Nc segments should spread over an integer number of poles Nss.
•	 For even Nss, Ns is even and integer q is feasible. For fractionary q, Nss may be an odd number and 
contain 3 as a factor.
•	 For fractionary q = b + c/d symmetrical windings are obtained in general for d/3 ≠ integer. 
Windings are made with wave coils and one turn per coil and with lap coils when two or more 
turn per coil are used.

	 with c/d = 1/2 (b > 3) the subharmonics are eliminated.
•	 Apparently, once the value of q is settled, the number of turns per current path is obtained from 
the stator geometry and the total rated emf et ≈ 1.03–1.10 p.u.
	
	   For one turn (bar) per coil, the number of slots is directly related to the number of turns/path 
Wa and number of current paths a:
	
N   a W

	 It is now clear how crucial the choice of Ns is as Wa—integer—comes directly from the emf et 
value.
•	 To size the stator core, the air gap g has to be computed first, as the rotor diameter Dr is already 
known.
	
	   Sizing g is directly related to stator rated linear current loading A, pole pitch τ, air gap flux 
density fundamental Bg1 and the desired xd (SCR).
•	 The rated voltage increases with SG power/unit and is larger for direct cooling. It is, otherwise, 
decided by the manufacturer.
	
	   In general, Vnline < 28 kV, but cable winding (at 40–100 kV) SGs are in the advance development 
stage. They lead to the elimination of the step-up transformer that accompanies practically all SG 
tied to power systems.

401
Design of Synchronous Generators
•)>> The salient pole rotors are designed for variable air gap under the pole, to render the air gap flux 
density more sinusoidal. The maximum to minimum air gap gmax/g ratio is up to 2.5.
琀
屴  In practice, the radius of the pole shoe shape Rp is notably smaller than rotor radius D/2.
•)>> Damper cage design is based on the main assertion that the cage bars total cross area represents 
(15%–30%) of stator slots area.
琀
屴  The damper cage slot pitch τd is chosen to reduce losses in the damper cage due to stator mmf 
space harmonics. For fractionary stator windings (q = (bd + c)/d) when bd + c > q, it is feasible to 
choose τs = τd (τs, stator slot pitch). For bd + c < q or q = b +1/2, τs ≠ τd.
琀
屴  The damper bars of copper or brass are welded to end rings whose cross-section is about half 
the bars cross-section per rotor pole.
•)>> The cylindrical rotor, made of single or multiple (axially) solid iron rings, is slotted along about 
2/3 of its periphery to host the field coils. Lower air gap flux harmonics are obtained by placing 
the field coils in slots, while also this is the only mechanically feasible solution to withstand the 
centrifugal force stresses.
琀
屴  To design the field winding, the rated field mmf is required. As at this stage in design this is not 
known a value of 2–2.5 times the rated stator mmf per pole is adopted.
•)>> The open-circuit saturation curve may be obtained through an analytical model accounting for 
magnetic saturation or through FEM.
•)>> The rated field mmf is obtained traditionally through the Potier diagram (Figure 7.24) or through 
the partial magnetization curves (Figure 7.25).
琀
屴  The second method allows for cross-coupling saturation, while the first method does not and is 
more adequate for cylindrical rotor SGs.
琀
屴  Based on the partial magnetization curves method, the synchronous reactances xd may be 
determined as functions of id and iq as families of curves. Alternatively, Ψd(id, iq) and Ψq(id, iq) may 
be obtained.
琀
屴  Such information is essential in calculating with good precision the rated power angle and in 
general steady state performance of SGs.
•)>> The computation of rotor resistances and various leakage inductances is rather straightforward if 
approximate formulae are accepted.
琀
屴  They proved adequate in industry though today they may be computed by FEM also.
•)>> The solid rotor behaves as an equivalent damper cage with variable parameters. A reliable ana-
lytical model to calculate these parameters is presented. This model has been recently validated 
by FEM.

•)>> Emf time harmonics are limited by standards. Higher q, coil chording, and fractionary q are 
all used to reduce emf time harmonics. The variable air gap obtained by shaping the rotor 
salient poles reduces the fifth and seventh harmonics while it introduces the third harmonic 
at the 10%–14% level.
•)>> The interaction of field mmf fundamental with stator slot openings may produce the so-called 
slot-ripple emf effect: that is, additional damper cage losses at no-load. With Ns/p1 as an odd num-
ber ideally zero damper cage additional losses at no-load occur.

Hooke–Jeeves and genetic algorithm methods is presented.
•)>> For generator/motor units, a rather detailed discussion of motor starting and synchronization 
methods is given. The unit has to withstand the rather daily start–stop encountered in generator/
motor cycles for pump-storage operation modes.

Testing of Synchronous Generators
Testing of synchronous generators (SGs) is performed to obtain the steady-state performance char-
acteristics and the circuit parameters for dynamic (transients) analysis. The testing methods may be 
divided into standard and research types. Tests of a more general nature are included in standards that 
are renewed from time to time to include recent well-documented progress in the art. IEEE standards 
115-1995 present a rather comprehensive plethora of tests for synchronous machines (SMs).
New procedures start as research tests. Some of them end up later on as standard tests. Standstill 
­frequency-response (SSFR) testing of SGs for parameter estimation is such a happy case. In what follows, a 
review of standard testing methods and the incumbent theory to calculate the steady-state performance and, 
respectively, the parameter estimation for dynamics analysis is presented. In addition, a few new (research) 
testing methods with strong potential to become standard in the future are also treated in some detail.
Note that the term research testing may be used also with the meaning as “tests to research for new 
performance features of synchronous generators.” Determination of flux density distribution in the air 
gap via search coil or that Hall probes is such an example. We will not dwell on such “research testing 
methods” in this chapter.
The standard testing methods are divided into the following aspects:
•	 Acceptance tests
•	 (Steady-state) performance tests
•	 Parameter estimation tests (for dynamic analysis)
From the nonstandard research tests, we will treat mainly “standstill step voltage response” and the 
on-load parameter estimation methods.
8.1  Acceptance Testing
According to IEEE Std. 115-1995 SG, acceptance tests are classified as follows:

8.1.1  A1. Insulation Resistance Testing
Testing for insulation resistance including polarization index, influences of temperature, moisture, 
and voltage duration are all covered in IEEE Std. 43-1974. If the moisture is too high in the wind-
ings, the insulation resistance is very low and the machine has to be dried out before further testing is 
­performed on it.
8.1.2  A2. Dielectric and Partial Discharge Tests
The magnitude, wave shape, and duration of the test voltage are given in ANSI-NEMA MGI-1978. As 
the applied voltage is high, procedures to avoid injury to personnel are prescribed in IEEE Std 4-1978. 
The test voltage is applied to each electrical circuit with all the other circuits and metal parts grounded. 
During the testing of the field winding, the brushes are lifted. In brushless excitation SGs, the DC excita-
tion leads should be disconnected unless the exciter is to be tested simultaneously. The eventual diodes 
(­thyristors) to be tested should be short-circuited but not grounded. The applied voltage may be as follows:
•	 Alternating voltage at rated frequency
•	 Direct voltage (1.7 times the rated SGs voltage)—with the winding thoroughly grounded to 
­dissipate the charge
•	 Very low-frequency voltage 0.1 Hz, 1.63 times the rated SG voltage
8.1.3  A3. Resistance Measurement
DC stator and field winding resistance measurement procedures are given in IEEE Std.-118-1978.

k = 234.5 for pure copper, in °C.
The reference field winding resistance may be DC measured either at standstill, with the rotor at 
ambient temperature, and the current applied through clamping rings or from a running test at normal 
speed. The brush voltage drop has to be eliminated from voltage measurement.
If the same DC measurement is made at standstill, right after SG running at rated field current, the 
result may be used to determine the field winding temperature at rated conditions, provided the brush 
voltage drop is eliminated from measurements.
8.1.4  A4–5. Tests for Short-Circuited Field Turns 
and Polarity Test for Field Insulation
The purpose of these tests is to check for field coils short-circuited turns, number of turns/coil, and 
short-circuit conductor size. Besides tests at standstill, a test at rated speed is required as short-circuited 
turns may occur at speed. There are DC and AC voltage tests for the scope. The DC or AC voltage drop 
across each field coil is measured. A more than +2% difference between the coil voltage drops indicates 
possible short circuits in the respective coils. The method is adequate for salient-pole rotors.
For cylindrical rotors, the DC field winding resistance is measured and compared with values from 
previous tests. A smaller resistance indicates that short-circuited turns may be present.

407
Testing of Synchronous Generators
Also, a short-circuited coil with U-shaped core may be placed to bridge one coil slot. The U-shaped core 
coil is placed successively on all rotor slots. The field winding voltage or the impedance of the winding voltage 
or the impedance of the exciting coil decreases in case if there are some short-circuited turns in the respective 
field coil. Alternatively, a Hall flux probe may be moved in the air gap from pole to pole and the flux density 
value and polarity at standstill may be measured, with the field coil DC fed at (5%–10%) of rated current value.
If the flux density amplitude is higher or smaller than for neighboring poles, some field coil turns are 
short-circuited (or the air gap is larger/smaller) for the corresponding rotor pole. If the flux density does 
not switch polarity regularly (after each pole), the field coil connections are not correct.
8.1.5  A6. Shaft Current and Bearing Insulation
Irregularities in the SG magnetic circuit lead to a small axial flux that links the shaft. A parasitic ­current 
occurs in the shaft bearings and in the machine frame unless the bearings are insulated from stator 
core or from rotor shaft. The presence of PWM static converters in the stator (or rotor) of SG augments 
this phenomenon. The pertinent testing is performed with the machine at no-load and rated voltage. 
The voltage between shaft ends is measured with a high impedance voltmeter. The same current flows 
through the bearing radially to the stator frame.
The presence of voltage across bearing oil film (in uninsulated bearings) is also an indication of the 
shaft voltage.
If insulated bearings are used, their effectiveness is checked by shorting the insulation and observing 
an increased shaft voltage. Shaft voltage above a few volts, with insulated bearings, is considered unac-
ceptable due to bearing in-time damaging and, in general, grounded brushes in shaft ends are necessary 
to prevent it.
8.1.6  A7. Phase Sequence
Phase sequencing is required for securing given rotation direction or for correct phasing of a generator 
prepared for power bus connection. As known, phase sequencing can be reversed by interchanging any 
two armature (stator) terminals.
There are a few procedures to check phase sequence:
•)>> Using a phase sequence indicator (or induction machine)
•)>> Using a neon-lamp phase-sequence indicator (Figure 8.1)
•)>> Using the lamp method (Figure 8.1b)
When the SG no-load voltage sequence is 1–2–3 (clockwise), the neon lamp 1 will glow; while for the 
1–3–2 sequence, the neon lamp 2 will glow. The test switch is open during these checks. The apparatus 
works correctly if, when the test switch is closed, both lamps glow with same intensity (Figure 8.1a).

With four voltage transformers and four lamps (Figure 8.1b), the relative sequence of SG phases to 
power grid is checked. For direct voltage sequence, all four lamps brighten and dim simultaneously; 
while for opposite sequence the two groups of lamps brighten and dim one after the other.
8.1.7  A8. Telephone-Influence Factor
Telephone-influence factor (TIF) is measured for the SG alone, with the excitation supply replaced by 
a ripple-free supply. The step-up transformers connected to SG terminals are disconnected. TIF is the 
ratio between the weighted rms value of SG no-load voltage fundamental plus harmonics ETIF and the 
“rms” of the fundamental Erms:

Tn is the TIF weighting factor for the nth harmonic. If potential (voltage) transformers are used to 
reduce the terminal voltage for measurements, care must be exercised to eliminate influences on the 
harmonics content of the SG no-load voltage.
8.1.8  A9. Balanced Telephone-Influence Factor
For definition, see IEEE Std. 100-1992.
In essence, for a three-phase wye-connected stator, the TIF for two line voltages is measured at rated 
speed and voltage on no-load. The same factor may be computed (for wye connection) for the line-to-
neutral voltages, excluding the harmonics 3, 6, 9, 12,….
8.1.9  A10. Residual-Component Telephone-Influence Factor
For machines connected in delta, a corner of delta may be open, at no load, rated speed, rated voltage. 
The TIF is calculated across the open delta corner.

Protection from accidental measured overvoltage is necessary and the use of protection gap and fuses to 
ground the instruments is recommended.
For machines that cannot be connected in delta, three identical potential transformers connected in 
wye in primary are open-delta-connected in their secondary. The neutral of the potential transformer is 
connected to the SG neutral point.
All measurements are now made as discussed, but in the open-delta secondary of the potential 
transformers.
8.1.10  A11. Line-to-Neutral Telephone-Influence Factor
The line-to-neutral TIF is measured in the secondary of a potential transformer whose primary is con-
nected between an SG phase terminals and its neutral points. A check of values balanced, residual, and 
line-to-neutral TIFs is obtained from the following:

8.1.11  A12. Stator Terminal Voltage Waveform Deviation 
and Distortion Factors
Definitions of deviation factor and distortion factor are given in IEEE Std. 100-1992. In principle, the 
no-load SG terminals voltage is acquired (recorded) with a digital scope (or digital data acquisition 
­system) at high speed, and only a half-period is retained (Figure 8.2).
The half-period time is divided in J (at least 18) equal parts. The interval j is characterized by Ej. 
Consequently, the zero-to-peak amplitude of the equivalent sine wave EOM is

8.1.12  A13. Overspeed Tests
Overspeed tests are not mandatory but are performed upon request, especially for hydro or thermal 
turbine-driven generators that experience transient overspeed upon loss of load. The SG has to be care-
fully checked for mechanical integrity before overspeeding it by a motor (it could be the turbine (prime-
mover) itself).
If overspeeding above 115% is required, it is necessary to pause briefly at various speed steps to make 
sure the machine is still OK. If the machine has to be excited, the level of excitation has to be reduced to 
limit the terminal voltage at about 105%. Detailed inspection checks of the machine are recommended 
after overspeeding and before starting it again.
8.1.13  A14. Line Charging Capacity
Line charging represents the SG reactive power capacity when at synchronism, at zero-power-factor, 
rated voltage and zero field current. In other words, the SG behaves as a reluctance generator at no load.

8.1.14  A15. Acoustic Noise
Airborne sound tests are given in IEEE Std. 85-1973 and in ANSI Std. C50.12-1982. Noise is the undesired 
sound. The durations in hours of human exposure per day to various noise levels is regulated by Health 
Administration Agencies.
An omnidirectional microphone with amplifier weighting filters, processing electronics and an indi-
cating dial makes a sound-level measuring device. ANSI “A,” “B,” “C” frequency domain is required for 
noise control and its suppression according to pertinent standards.
8.2  Testing for Performance (Saturation Curves, 
Segregated Losses, and Efficiency)
In large SGs, the efficiency is, in general, calculated based on segregated losses, measured in special tests 
that avoid direct loading.
Individual losses are as follows:
	
1.	 Windage and friction loss
	
2.	 Core losses (on open circuit)
	
3.	 Stray-load losses (on short circuit)
	
4.	 Stator (armature) winding loss: 3Is
2Ra with Ra calculated at specified temperature.
	
5.	 Field winding loss Ifd
2Rfd with Rfd calculated at a specified temperature
Among the widely accepted loss measurement methods, four of them are mentioned here:
	
1.	 The separate drive method
	
2.	 The electric input method
	
3.	 The deceleration (retardation) method
	
4.	 The heat transfer method
For methods (1), (2), and (3), two tests are run: one with open circuit and the other with short circuit at 
SG terminals. In open-circuit tests, the windage–friction plus core losses plus field winding losses occur. 
In short-circuit tests, the stator winding losses, windage–friction losses, and stray load losses, besides 
field winding losses are present.
During all these tests, the bearings temperature should be held rather constant. Also, the coolant 
temperature, humidity, gas density should be known and their appropriate influences on losses be con-
sidered. If a brushless exciter is used, its input power has to be known and subtracted from SG losses. 
When the SG is driven by a prime-mover that may not be uncoupled from SG, the prime-mover input 
and losses have to be known. In vertical shaft SGs with hydraulic turbine runners, only the thrust-
bearing loss corresponding to SG weight should be attributed to the SG.
Dewatering with runner seal cooling water shut-off of the hydraulic turbine generator is required. 
Francis and propeller turbines may be dewatered at standstill and, in general, with manufacturer’s 
approval. On the way of segregating open-circuit and short-circuit loss components, the no-load and 
short-circuit saturation curves have to be obtained from measurements, also.
8.2.1  Separate Driving for Saturation Curves and Losses
If the speed can be controlled accurately, the SG prime-mover itself can be used to drive the SG for 
open-circuit and short-circuit tests, but only to determine the saturation open-circuit and short-circuit 
curves, not for loss measurements.

412
Synchronous Generators
Therefore, in general, a “separate” directly or through belt gear coupled to the SG motor has to be 
used. If the exciter is capable of doing it, the best case is met. In general, the driving motor 3%–5% 
rating corresponds to open-circuit test. For small- and medium-power SGs, a dynamometer driver 
is adequate as the torque and speed of latter are measured, and thus the input power to the tested 
SG is known.
But today, when the torque and speed is estimated, in commercial direct torque-controlled (DTC) IM 
drives with PWM converters, the input to the SG for testing is also known, thus eliminating the dyna-
mometer and providing for precise speed control (Figure 8.3)
•)>> The open-circuit saturation curve
The open-circuit saturation curve is obtained when driving the SG at rated speed, on open 
circuit and acquiring the SG terminal voltage, frequency, and field current.
At least six readings below 60%, ten from 60% to 110%, two from 110% to 120%, and one at 
about 120% of rated speed voltage are required. Monotonous increase in field current should be 
observed. The step-up power transformer at SG terminals should be, in general, disconnected to 
avoid unintended high-voltage operation (and excessive core losses) in the latter.
When the tests are performed at lower-than-rated speed (i.e., in hydraulic units), corrections 
for frequency (speed) have to be made. A typical open-circuit saturation curve is shown in Figure 
8.4. The air gap line corresponds to the maximum slope from origin that is tangent to the satura-
tion curve.
•)>> The core, friction, and windage losses
The aggregated core, friction, and windage losses may be measured as the input power P10 
(Figure 8.3) for each open-circuit voltage-level reading. As the speed is kept constant, the wind-
age and friction losses are constant (Pfw = const). Only the core losses Pcore increase approximately 
with voltage squared (Figure 8.5).
•)>> The short-circuit saturation curve
The SG is driven at rated speed with short-circuited armature, while acquiring the stator and 
field currents; Isc and If values should be read at rated 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Data at 125% 
rated current should be given by the manufacturer, to avoid overheating the stator. The high cur-
rent points should be taken first so that the temperature during testing stays almost constant. 
The short-circuit saturation curve (Figure 8.4) is a rather straight line as expected, because the 
machine is unsaturated during steady-state short circuit.

At each value of short-circuit stator current, Isc, the input power to the tested SG (or the output

stator-winding DC losses (3Isc3

During the tests, it may happen that the friction windage loss modifies because temperature rises. For 
a specified time interval, an open-circuit test with zero field current is performed when the whole loss 
is the friction windage loss (P10 = Pfw). If Pfw varies with more than 10%, corrections have to be made for 
successive tests.
Advantage may be taken by the presence of driving motor (rated at less than 5% SG ratings) to run 
zero-power-factor load tests at rated current and measure the field current If, terminal voltage V1; from 
rated voltage downward.
A variable reactance is required to load the SG at zero power factor. A running underexcited SMSM 
may constitute such a reactance made variable through its field current. Adjusting the field current of 
the SG and SM leads to voltage increasing points on the zero-power-factor saturation curve (Figure 8.4).
8.2.2  Electric Input (Idle-Motoring) Method for Saturation Curves and Losses
According to this method, the SG performs as an unloaded synchronous motor supplied from a variable 
voltage constant frequency power rating supply. Though standards indicate doing these tests at rated 
speed only, there are generators that work as motors also. Gas-turbine generators with bidirectional 
static converters that use variable speed for generation and turbine starting as a motor are a typical 
example. The availability of PWM static converters with close to sinusoidal current waveforms recom-
mends them for the no-load motoring of SG. Alternatively, a lower rating SG (below 3% of SG rating) 
may provide for the variable voltage supply.
The testing scheme for the electric input method is described in Figure 8.7.
When supplied from the PWM static converter, the SG acting as an idling motor is accelerated to the 
desired speed by a sensorless control system. The tested machine is vector controlled, and thus it is “in 
synchronism” at all speeds.
In contrast, when the power supply is a nearby SG, the tested SG is started either as an asynchronous 
motor or by accelerating the power supply generator simultaneously with the tested machine. Let us 
suppose that SG has been brought to rated speed and acts as no-load motor. To segregate the no-load 
loss components, the idling motor is supplied with descending stator voltage and descending field cur-
rent such that to keep unity power factor conditions (minimum stator current). The loss components of 
(input electric power) Pon are:

There is a minimum stator voltage V1min, at unity power factor, for which the idling synchronous 
motor remains at synchronism. The difference Pom − Pcu10 is represented in Figure 8.8 as a function of 
voltage squared to underscore the core loss almost proportionally to voltage squared at given frequency 
(or to V/f in general). A straight line is obtained through curve fitting. This straight line is prolonged 
to the vertical axis, and thus the mechanical loss Pfw is obtained. Therefore, the Pcore and Pfw have been 
segregated. The open-circuit saturation curve may be obtained as a bonus (down to 30% rated voltage)

by neglecting the voltage drop over the synchronous reactance (current is small) in general and over the 
stator resistance, which is even smaller. Moreover, if the synchronous reactance Xs (an “average” of Xd

The precision in E1 is thus improved and the obtained open-circuit saturation curve (E1(If)) is more 
reliable. The initial 30% part of the open-circuit saturation curve is drawn as the air gap line (the tangent 
through origin to the measured open-circuit magnetic curve section). To determine the short-circuit 
and stray load losses, the idling motor is left to run at about 30% voltage (even at a lower value but for 
stable operation, Figure 8.9). By controlling the field current at this low, but constant, voltage, about six 
current step measurements are made from 125% to 25% of rated stator current. At least two points with 
very low stator current are also required. Again total losses for this idling test are

This time, the test is performed at constant voltage, but the field current is decreased to increase the 
stator current up to 125%. Therefore, the stray load losses become important. As the field current is 
reduced, the power factor decreases, so care must be exercised to measure the input electric power with 
good precision. As the Pfw loss is already known from the previous testing, speed is constant, Pcore is 
known from same source at same low voltage at unity power factor conditions, only Pcore + Pstrayload have 
to be determined as a function of stator current.
Additionally, the dependence of Ia on If may be plotted from this low-voltage test (Figure 8.9). The 
intersection of this curve side with the abscissa delivers the field current that corresponds to the testing 
voltage V1 min on the open-circuit magnetization curve. The short-circuit saturation curve is just a paral-
lel to V curve side Ia(If) (see Figure 8.10).
We may conclude that both separate driving and electric power input test allow for the segregation 
of all loss components in the machine and thus provide for the SG conventional efficiency computation:

Testing of Synchronous Generators
The rated stator winding loss Pcu1n and the rated stray load loss Pstrayload are determined in short-circuit 
tests at rated current, while Pcore is determined from the open-circuit test at rated voltage. It is disputable 
if the core losses calculated in the no-load test and stray load losses from the short-circuit test are the 
same when the SG operates on loads of various active and reactive power level.
8.2.3  Retardation (Free Deceleration Tests)
In essence, after the SG operates as uncoupled motor at steady state to reach normal temperatures, its 
speed is raised to 110%. Evidently, a separate SG supply capable of producing 110% rated frequency is 
required. Alternatively, a lower rated PWM converter may be used to supply the SG to slowly accelerate 
the SG as a motor. Then, the source is disconnected. The prime mover of the SG has been decoupled or 
“dewatered.”
The deceleration tests are performed with If, Ia = 0, then with If ≠ 0, Ia = 0 (open circuit), and, respec-
tively, for If = const and V1 = 0 (short circuit). In the three cases, the motion equation leads to

The speed versus time during deceleration is measured, but its derivation with time has to be estimated 
through an adequate digital filter to secure a smooth signal.
Provided the inertia J is known a priori, at about rated speed, the speed ωrn and its derivative dωr/dt 
are acquired and then used to calculate the losses for that rated speed as shown on the right-hand side 
of Equation 8.19 (Figure 8.11).

This way, the open-circuit saturation curve E1(IF) is obtained, provided the terminal voltage is also acquired.
Note:  If the SG is excited from its exciter (brushless, in general), care must be exercised to keep the 
excitation current constant, and also the exciter input power should be deducted from losses.
If overspeeding is not permitted, the data are collected at lower than rated speed with the losses cor-
rected to rated speed (frequency).
A tachometer, a speed recorder, or a frequency digital electronic detector may be used.
As already pointed out, the inertia J has to be known a priori for retardation tests. Inertia may be 
computed by quite a few methods such as through computation by manufacturer or from Equation 8.19, 
provided the friction and windage loss at rated speed Pfw (ωrn) are already known. With the same test set, 
the SG is run as an idling motor at rated speed and voltage for unity power factor (minimum current). 
Subtracting from input powers, the stator winding loss, Pfw + Pcore, corresponding to no load at same 
field current, If is obtained. Then Equation 8.19 is used again to obtain J. Finally, the physical pendulum 
method may be applied to calculate J (see IEEE Std.115-1995, paragraph 4.4.15).
For SGs with closed-loop water coolers the calorimetric method may be used to measure directly the 
losses. Finally, the efficiency may be calculated from the measured output to measured input to SG. This 
direct approach is suitable for low- and medium-power SGs that can be fully loaded by the manufacturer 
to measure directly the input and output with good precision (better than 0.1%–0.2%).
8.3  Excitation Current under Load and Voltage Regulation
The excitation (field) current required to operate the SG at rated steady-state active power, power factor, 
and voltage is a paramount factor in the thermal design of a machine.
Two essentially graphical methods, the Potier reactance and the partial saturation curves, have been 
introduced in Chapter 7 on design. Here we will treat, basically, in more detail, variants of Potier reac-
tance method.
To determine the excitation current under specified load conditions, the Potier (or leakage) reactance 
Xp, the unsaturated d and q reactance Xdu, Xqu, armature resistance Ra and the open-circuit saturation 
curve are all needed. Methods for determining the Potier and leakage reactance are given first.

8.3.1  The Armature Leakage Reactance
We can safely say that there is not yet a widely accepted (standardized) direct method to measure the stator 
leakage (reactance) of SGs. To the valuable heritage of analytical expressions for the various components 
of Xl (see Chapter 7) finite elements method (FEM) calculation procedures have been added lately [1,2].
The stator leakage inductance may be calculated by subtracting two measured inductances:

Finally, Naf is the field to armature equivalent turn ratio, which may be extracted from design data or

A method to measure directly the leakage inductance (reactance) is given in Reference [3]. The reduc-
tion of Potier reactance when the terminal voltage increases is documented in Reference [3]. A simpler 
approach to estimate Xl would be the average of homopolar reactance Xo and reactance of the machine 
without the rotor in place, Xlair.

Synchronous Generators
The measurement of Xo will be presented later in this chapter, while Xlair may be measured 
through a three phase AC test at low voltage level, with the rotor out of place. As expected, mag-
netic saturation is not present in measuring Xo and Xlair. In reality, for large values of stator currents 
and (or) for very high levels of magnetic saturation of stator teeth or rotor pole, the leakage flux 
paths get saturated and Xl slightly decreases. FEM inquires [1,2] suggest that such a phenomenon 
is notable.
When identifying the machine model under various conditions, a rather realistic, even though not 
exact, value of leakage reactance is a priori given. The aforementioned methods may serve this purpose 
well, as saturation will be accounted through other components of machine model.
8.3.2  Potier Reactance
Difficulties in measuring the leakage reactance have led shortly after the year 1900 to the introduction by 
Potier as an alternative reactance (Potier reactance), which can be measured from the zero-power-factor 
load tests, at given stator voltage. At rated voltage tests, the Potier reactance Xp may be, in general, larger 
than the actual leakage reactance by as much as 20%–30%.
The open-circuit saturation and zero-power-factor rated current saturation curves are required to 
determine the value of Xp (Figure 8.12).
At rated voltage level, the segment a′d′ = ab is marked. A parallel to the air gap line through a' inter-
sects the open-circuit saturation curve at point b′. The segment b′c′ is as follows:

(8.27)
It is argued that the value of Xp obtained at rated voltage level may be notably larger than the leakage 
reactance Xl, at least for salient-pole rotor SGs. A simple way of correcting this situation is to apply the

It is not yet clear what overvoltage level can be considered, but less than 110% is rather feasible if the SG 
may be run at such overvoltage without excessive overheating, even if only for obtaining the zero-power-
factor saturation curve up to 110% rated voltage.
When the SM is operated as an SG on full load, other methods to calculate Xp from measurements 
are applicable [4].
8.3.3  Excitation Current for Specified Load
The excitation field current for specified electric load conditions (voltage, current, power factor) may be 
calculated by using the phasor diagram (Figure 8.13).
Ea—terminal phase voltage
Ia—terminal phase current
Eas—voltage back of Xqu
EGu—voltage back of Xdu
δ—power angle
φ—power factor angle
Ra—stator phase resistance
For given stator current Ia, terminal voltage Ea, and power factor angle φ, the power angle δ may be 
calculated from the phasor diagram as follows:

The “saturation” field current supplement is IFS. The field current IF corresponds to the saturated machine 
and is the excitation current under specified load. This information is crucial for the thermal design of 
SG. The procedure is similar for the cylindrical rotor machine where the difference between Xdu and Xqu 
is rather small (less than 10%).
For variants of this method, see Reference 4.
All methods in Reference 4 have in common a critical simplification: the magnetic saturation influ-
ence is the same in axes d and q, while the power angle δ calculated with unsaturated reactance Xqu is 
considered to hold also for all load conditions.
The reality of saturation is much more complicated, but these simplifications are still widely accepted, 
as they apparently allowed for acceptable results thus far.
The consideration of different magnetization curves along axes d and q, even for cylindrical rotors, 
and the presence of cross-coupling saturation, have been discussed in Chapter 7 on design, via the par-
tial magnetization curve method. This is not the only approach to the computation of excitation current 
under load in a saturated SG, and new simplified methods to account for saturation under steady state 
are being produced [5].

Equation 8.23 is used in p.u. It is again obvious that the difference in saturation levels in the d and

8.3.5  Temperature Tests
By determining the temperature rise of various points in an SG, it is crucial to check its capability to 
deliver load power according to specifications. The temperature rise is calculated with respect to a refer-
ence temperature. Coolant temperature in now a widely accepted reference temperature.
Temperature rise at one (rated) or more specified load levels is required from temperature tests.
When possible, direct loading should be applied to do temperature testing, either at manufacturer’s 
or at user’s site.
Four common temperature testing methods are described here:
	
1.	 Conventional (direct) loading
	
2.	 Synchronous feedback (back-to-back M + G) loading
	
3.	 Zero-power-factor test
	
4.	 Open-circuit and short-circuit loading
8.3.5.1  Conventional Loading
The SG is loaded for specified conditions of voltage, frequency, active power, armature current, and field 
current (the voltage regulator is disengaged). The machine terminal voltage should be maintained within 
±2% of rated value. If so, the temperature rise of different parts of the machine may be plotted versus p.u. 
squared apparent power (MVA)2. As the voltage dependent and current dependent losses are unequal, in 
general, the stator winding temperature rise may be plotted versus armature current squared (A2), while 
the field winding temperature, versus field winding dissipated power: P

2 kW . Linear depen-
dencies are expected. If temperature testing is to be done before commissioning the SG, then methods 
2, 3, and 4 are to be used.
8.3.5.2  Synchronous Feedback (Back-to-Back) Loading Testing
Two identical SGs are coupled together with their rotor axes shifted with respect to each other by twice 
the rated power angle (2δn). They are driven to rated speed before connecting electrically their stators 
together (C1-open) (Figure 8.15).

Synchronous Generators
Then the excitation of both machines is raised until both SMs show the same rated voltage. With 
the synchronization conditions met, the power switch C1 is closed. Further on, the excitation of one of 
the two identical machines is reduced. That machine becomes a motor and the other a generator. Then, 
simultaneously, SM excitation current is reduced and that of the SG is increased to keep the terminal 
voltage at rated value. The current between the two machines increases until the excitation current of 
the SG reaches its rated value, by now known for rated power, voltage, cos ϕ. The speed is maintained 
constant through all these arrangements. The net output power of the driving motor covers the losses 
of the two identical SMs, 2Σp, but the power exchanged between the two machines is the rated power Pn 
and can be measured. Therefore, even the rated efficiency can be calculated, besides offering adequate 
loading for temperature tests by taking measurements every half an hour until temperatures stabilize.
Two identical machines are required for this arrangement, along with the lower (6%) rating driving 
motor and its coupling. It is possible to use only the SM and SG, with SM driving the set, but then the 
local power connectors have to be sized to the full rating of the tested machines.
It is also possible, in principle, to virtually load two uncoupled SG fed from four quadrant AC–DC 
full power converters, one under generator and one under motor control, with a certain switching from 
M to G operation. Again, the power grid provides for losses in the two machines and converters system.
8.3.5.3  Zero-Power-Factor-Load Test
The SG works as a synchronous motor uncoupled at shaft; that is, a synchronous condenser (S.CON). As 
the active power drawn from the power grid is equal to SM losses, the method is energy efficient.
There are, however, two problems:
)>>
1.)>> Starting and synchronizing the SM to the power source
)>>
2.)>> Making sure that the losses in the S.CON equal to the losses in the SG at specified load conditions
Starting may be done through an existing SG supply that is accelerated in the same time with the SM, 
up to the rated speed. A synchronous motor starting may be used instead.
To adjust the stator winding, core losses and field windings losses, for given speed, and provide for 
rated mechanical losses, the supply voltage(Ea)S.CON and the field current may be adjusted.
In essence the voltage (Ep)S.CON has to provide the same voltage behind Potier reactance with the 
S.CON as with the voltage Ea of SG at specified load (Figure 8.16).

There are two more problems with this otherwise good test method for heating. One problem is the neces-
sity of the variable voltage source at the level of the rated current of the SG. The second is related to the 
danger of too high a temperature in the field winding in SGs designed for larger than 0.9 rated power factor. 
The high level of Ep in the SG tests claims to a large field current (larger than for rated load in the SG design).

Other adjustments have to be made for refined loss equivalence, such that the temperature rise to be 
very close to that in the actual SG at specified (rated load) conditions.
Open-circuit and short-circuit “loading”
As elaborated in Chapter 7 on design, the total losses are the SG under load is obtained by adding the 
open-circuit losses at rated voltage and the short-circuit losses at rated current and while correcting for 
duplication of heating due to windage losses.
In other words, the open-circuit and short-circuit tests are performed sequentially and the 
­overtemperatures Δtt = (Δt)open circuit and Δtsc are added, while subtracting the additional temperature 
rise due to duplication of mechanical losses Δtw:

The temperature rise (Δt)w due to windage losses may be determined by a zero excitation open-circuit

8.4  Need for Determining Electrical Parameters
Prior to 1945–1965, SG transient and subtransient parameters have been developed and used to deter-
mine balanced and unbalanced fault currents. For stability response, constant voltage back-transient 
reactance model has been applied in same period.
The development of power electronics-controlled exciters has led, after 1965, to high initial excitation 
response. Considerably, more sophisticated SG and excitation control systems models have thus become 
necessary. Time-domain digital simulation tools have been developed and small-signal linear eigenvalue 
analysis has thus become the norm in SG stability and control studies. Besides second-order (two-rotor 
circuits in parallel along each orthogonal axis) SG models, third and higher rotor-order models have 
been developed to accommodate the wider frequency spectrum encountered by some power electronics 
excitation systems. These practical requirements led to the IEEE Std. 115A-1987 on standstill frequency 
testing to deal with third rotor-order SG models identification.
Tests to determine the SG parameters for steady states and for transients have been developed and 
standardized since 1965 at rather high pace. Steady-state parameters: Xd—unsaturated (Xdu) and satu-
rated (Xds)—and Xq—unsaturated (Xqu) and saturated (Xqs)—are required first to compute the active and 
reactive power delivered by the SG at given power angle, voltage, armature current, and field current.

Synchronous Generators
The field current required for given active, reactive powers, power factor, and voltage—as described in 
previous paragraphs—is necessary for calculating the maximum reactive power that the SG can deliver 
within given (rated) temperature constraints. The line charging-maximum absorbed reactive power of the 
SG at zero power factor (zero active power) is also calculated based on steady-state parameters.
Load-flow studies are based on steady-state parameters as influenced by magnetic saturation and 
temperature (resistances Ra and Rf). The subtransient and transient parameters ( ¢¢
xd, ¢xd, ¢¢
Td , ¢
Td, ¢¢
xq, ¢xq, ¢¢
Tdo, 
¢
Tdo, ¢¢
Tqo), determined by processing the three-phase short-circuit tests, are in general used to study the 
power system protection and circuit-breaker fault interruption requirements. The magnetic saturation 
influence on these parameters is also needed for better precision when they are applied at rated voltage 
and higher current conditions. Empirical corrections for saturation are still the norm.
Standstill frequency tests (SSFR) are used to determine mainly third-order rotor model sub-­subtransient, 
subtransient and transient reactances, and time constants at low values of stator current (0.5% of rated 
current). They may be identified through various regression methods and some of them have been shown 
to fit well the SSFR from 0.001 to 200 Hz. Such a broad frequency spectrum occurs in very few transients 
as of such. Also, the transients occur at rather high and variable local saturation levels in the SG.
In just how many real-life SG transients such advanced SSFR methods are a must is not yet very clear. 
However, when lower frequency band response is required, SSFR results may be used, to produce the 
best “fit” transient parameters for that limited frequency band, through same regression methods.
The validation of these advanced third- (or higher) rotor-order models in most important real-time 
transients has led to the use of similar regression methods to identify the SG transient parameters 
from online admissible (provoked) transients. Such a transient is a 30% variation of excitation voltage. 
Limited frequency range oscillations of the exciter’s voltage may also be performed to identify SG mod-
els valid for on-load transients, a posteriori.
The limits of short-circuit tests or SSFR taken separately appear clearly in such situations and their 
combination to identify SG models is one more way of improvising the SG modeling for on-load transients. 
As all parameter estimation methods use p.u values, we will revisit them here in the standardized form.
8.5  Per Unit Values
Voltages, currents, powers, torque, reactances, inductances, and resistances are required, in general, in p.u. 
values with the inertia and time constants left in seconds. Per unitization has to be consistent. In general, 
three base quantities are selected, while all the others are derived from the latter. The three commonly used 
quantities are three-phase base power, SNΔ, line-to-line base terminal voltage ENΔ and the base frequency, fN.
To express a measurable physical quantity in p.u., its physical value is divided by the pertinent base 
value expressed in same units. Conversion of a p.u. quantity to a new base is done by multiplying the old 
p.u. value to the ratio of the old to the new base quantity. The three-phase power SNΔ of an SG is taken as 
its rated kVA (or MVA) output (apparent power).
Single-phase base powers SN is: SN = SNΔ/3.

When sinusoidal balanced operation is considered, the p.u. value of the line-to-line and of the phase

8.6  Tests for Parameters under Steady State
Steady-state operation of a three-phase SG usually takes place under balanced load conditions. That is, 
phase currents are equal in amplitude, but de-phased by 120° with each other. There are however situ-
ations when the SG has to operate under unbalanced steady-state conditions. As already detailed in 
Chapter 5 (on steady-state performance), unbalanced operation may be described through the method of 
symmetrical components. The steady-state reactances Xd, Xq, or X1 correspond to positive symmetrical 
component, X2 for the negative and Xo for the zero components. Together with direct sequence param-
eters for transients, X2 and Xo enter the expressions of generator current under unbalanced transients.
In essence, the tests that follow are designed for three-phase SGs but, with some adaptations, they 
may be used for single-phase generators also. However, this latter case will be treated separately in 
Chapter 20, on small power single-phase linear motion generators.
The parameters to be measured for steady-state modeling of SG are as follows:
Xdu—unsaturated direct axis reactance
Xds—saturated direct axis reactance dependent on SG voltage, power (in MVA), and power factor
Xadu—unsaturated direct axis mutual (stator-to-excitation) reactance already reduced to the stator 
(Xdu = Xadu + Xl)
Xl—stator leakage reactance
Xads—the saturated (main flux) direct axis magnetization reactance (Xds = Xads + Xl)
Xqu—unsaturated quadrature axis reactance
Xqs—saturated quadrature axis reactance
Xaqs—saturated quadrature axis magnetization reactance
X2—negative sequence resistance
Xo—zero-sequence reactance
Ro—zero-sequence resistance
SCR—short-circuit ratio (1/Xdu)
δ—internal power angle in radians or in electrical degrees
All resistances and reactances above are in p.u.

load conditions, as suggested by recent FEM calculations [1,2].

8.6.2.1  Slip Test
The SG is driven at very low slip (very close to synchronism) with open field winding. The stator is fed 
from three-phase power source at rated frequency. The slip is the ratio of the frequency of emf of the field 
winding to the rated frequency. A low-voltage spark gap across the field winding terminal will protect 
it from too high accidental emfs. The slip has to be very small, to avoid speed pulsations due to damper 
induced currents. The SG will pass from positions in direct to positions in quadrature axis, with varia-
tions in power source voltage Ea and current Ia from (Emax, Iamin) to (Emin, Iamax):

The degree of saturation depends on the level of current in the machine. To determine the unsaturated 
values of Xd and Xq, the voltage of the power source is reduced, in general below 60% of base value VN.
In principle, at rated voltage, notable saturation occurs, which at least for axis q may be calculated as 
function of Iq with Iq = Iamax. In axis d, the absence of field current makes Xd (Id = Iamin) less representative, 
though still useful, for saturation consideration.
8.6.2.2  Quadrature Axis (Reactance) Xq from Maximum Lagging Current Test
The SG is run as a synchronous motor with no mechanical load at open-circuit rated voltage field current 
IFG level, with applied voltages Ea less than 75% of base value EN. Subsequently, the field current is reduced 
to zero and then reversed in polarity and increased again in small increments with the opposite polarity. 
During this time period, the armature current increases slowly until instability occurs at Ias. When the 
field current polarity is changed, the electromagnetic torque (in phase quantities) becomes thus:

Testing of Synchronous Generators
Though the expression of Xq is straightforward, running the machine as a motor on no-load is not 
always feasible. Synchronous capacitors, however, are a typical case when such a situation occurs natu-
rally. There is some degree of saturation in the machine but mainly due to d-axis magnetizing mmfs 
(produced by excitation plus the armature reaction).
Catching the situation when stability is lost requires very small and slow increments in IF, which 
needs special efforts in equipment.
8.6.3  Negative Sequence Impedance Z2
Stator current harmonics may change the fundamental negative sequence voltage but without changes 
in the fundamental negative sequence current. This phenomenon is more pronounced in salient rotor 
pole machines with an incomplete damper ring or without damper winding because there is a difference 
between subtransient reactances ¢¢
Xd and ¢¢
Xq.
Consequently, during tests, sinusoidal negative sequence currents have to be injected to the stator and 
the fundamental frequency component of the negative sequence voltage has to be measured for a correct 
estimation of negative sequence impedance Z2. In general, corrections of the measured Z2 are operated 
based on a known value of the subtransient reactance ¢¢
Xd.
The negative sequence impedance is defined for a negative sequence current equal to rated current. 
A few steady-state methods to measure X2 are given here.
•)>> Applying negative sequence currents
With the field winding short-circuited, the SG is driven at synchronous (rated) speed while 
supplied with negative sequence currents in the stator at frequency fN. Values of currents around 
rated current are used to run a few tests and then claim an average Z2, by measuring input power 
current and voltage.
To secure sinusoidal currents, with a voltage source, linear reactors are connected in series. The 
waveform of one stator current should be analyzed. If current harmonics content is above 5%, the

8.6.4  Zero Sequence Impedance Zo

Though there is some degree of saturation considered in SCR, it is by no means the same as for rated 
load conditions; this way, SCR is only a qualitative performance index, required for preliminary design 
(see Chapter 7).

8.6.6  Angle δ, Xds, Xqs Determination from Load Tests
The load angle δ is defined as the angular displacement of the center line of a rotor pole field axis from 
the axis of stator mmf wave (space vector), for a specified load. In principle, δ may be measured during 
transients also. When iron loss is neglected, δ is the angle between the field current produced emf and 
the phase voltage Ea as apparent from the phasor diagram (Figure 8.23).
With the machine loaded, if the load angle δ is measured directly by a separate sensor, the steady-state 
load measurements may be used to determine the steady-state parameters Xds, Xqs, with known leakage 
reactance Xl (Xds = Xads + Xl) (Figure 8.21). The load angle δ may be calculated as follows:

As the leakage reactance Xl is considered already known, Ifd, Ea, δ measured directly (after reduction

Xds = Xl + Xads. The load angle may be measured by encoders and resolvers or by electronic angle shifting 
measuring devices, etc. [4].
The reduction factor of the directly measured excitation current to the stator from If to Ifd may be 
taken from design data or calculated from SSFR tests as shown later in this chapter. If load tests are 
performed for different currents and power factor angles at given voltage (P and Q) and δ, Ia, cos φ, 
Ifd are measured, families of curves Xads(Id + Ifd, Iq) and Xqs(Iq, Id + Ifd) are obtained. Alternatively, the

Based on such data, curve fitting functions may be built. Same data may be obtained from FEM calcula-
tions. Such a confrontation between FEM and direct tests steady-state parameter saturation curve fami-
lies (Figure 8.24) for online large SGs is still awaited for, while simplified interesting methods to account 
for steady-state saturation, including cross-coupling effects, are still produced [7,8].
The saturation curve family, Ψd(Iq, Id + Ifd) and Ψq(Iq, Id + Ifd) may be determined from standstill flux 
decay tests.
8.6.7  Saturated Steady-State Parameters from Standstill Flux Decay Tests
To account for magnetic saturation, high (rated) levels of current in the stator and in the field winding 
are required. Under standstill conditions, the cooling system of the generator might not permit long-
time operation. The testing time should be reduced. Further on, with currents in both axes (Iq, Id + Ifd) 
there will be torque. Therefore, the machine has to be stalled. Low-speed high-power SGs have large 
torque so that stalling is not easy.
If the tests are done either in axis d or in axis q, there will be no torque and the cross-coupling satu-
ration (between orthogonal axes) is not present. Flux decay tests consist of supplying first the machine 
with a small DC voltage with stator phases connected such that to place the stator mmf either along axis 
d or along axis q. All this time, the field winding may be short-circuited, open, or supplied with a DC 
current. At a certain moment after the Iao, Vo, IFo, are measured, the DC circuit is short-circuited by a fast 
switch with a very low voltage across it (when closed). A freewheeling diode may be used instead, but 
its voltage drop should be recorded and its integral during flux (current) decay time in the stator should 
be subtracted from the initial flux linkage. The d and q reactances are obtained then for the initial (DC) 
situation, corresponding to the initial flux linkage in the machine. The test is repeated with increasing 
values of initial currents along axis d(id + ifd) and q(iq) and the flux current curve family as in Figure 8.22 
is obtained. The same tests may be run on the field winding with open- or short-circuited stator.
A typical stator connection of phases for d axis flux decay tests is shown in Figure 8.25a.
To arrange the SG rotor in axis d, the stator windings, connected as in Figure 8.25a, are supplied a 
reasonably large DC current with the field winding short-circuited across the freewheeling diode. If the 
rotor is heavy and it will not move by itself easily, the stator is fed from an AC source with a small current 
and the rotor is rotated until the AC field-induced current with the freewheeling diode short-circuited 
will be maximum. Alternatively, if phase b and phase c in series are AC supplied then the rotor is moved 
until the AC field-induced current becomes zero. For fractionary stator winding, the position of axis d 
is not so clear and measurements in a few closely adjacent positions is required to average the results [4].

As if and not ifd (reduced to the stator) is measured, the value for the ratio a has to be determined first. 
It is possible to run a few flux decay tests on stator, with zero field current and then in the rotor, with 
zero stator current and use the aforementioned procedure to calculate the initial flux (final flux is zero). 
When the initial flux in the stator from both tests is the same (Figure 8.26), then the ratio of the cor-
responding currents constitute the reduction (turn ratio) value a:

Considering that the d-axis stator current and field current mmfs are almost equivalent, the cross-
coupling saturation in axis q is solved for all purposes. Not so in axis d where no cross-coupling has 
been explored.
A way out of this situation is to “move” the stator mmf connected as in Figure 8.25 by exchanging 
phases from a-b&c to b-a&c to c-a&b. This way the rotor is left in the d axis position corresponding to 
a-b&c (Figure 8.25). Now Id, Iq, Vd, Vq have to be considered together and thus both families of curves

d or q in large SG to determine steady-state parameters as influenced by saturation have been published 
[9], but still the procedure—standard in principle—has to be further documented by very neat tests 
with cross-coupling thoroughly considered, and with hysteresis and temperature influence on results 
eliminated.

Synchronous Generators
The flux decay tests at nonzero or non 90° electric angle, introduced already might be the way to go 
and get the whole flux/current (or flux/mmf) family of curves that characterizes the SG for various loads.
Note: It may be argued that though practically all values of id, iq, ifd may be produced in flux decay tests, 
the saturation influence on steady-state parameters may differ under load for same current triplet. This 
is true because under load (at rated speed), the stator iron is AC magnetized (at frequency fN) and not 
DC magnetized as in flux decay tests.
Direct load tests or FEM comparisons with these flux decay tests will tell if this is more than an aca-
demic issue. The whole process of standstill flux decay tests may be computerized and thus mechanized, 
as by now static power switches are available off-the-shelf. The tests take time but apparently notably less 
than the SSFR. The two types of tests are, in fact, complementary as one produces the steady-state (or 
static) saturated parameters for specified load conditions, while the other estimates the parameters for 
transients from such initial on-load steady-state states. The standstill flux decay tests have also been used 
to estimate the parameters for transients by curve fitting the currents decays versus time [10,11].
8.7  Tests to Estimate the Subtransient and Transient Parameters
Subtransient and transient parameters of the SG manifest themselves when sudden changes at or near 
stator terminals (short circuits) or in field current occur. Knowing the sudden balanced and unbalanced 
short-circuit stator current peak value and evolution in time until steady state is useful in the design of 
the SG protection, calibration of the trip stator and field current circuit breakers and calculation of the 
mechanical stress in the stator end-turns. Sudden short-circuit tests from no load or load operation have 
been performed now for more than 80 years and, in general, two stages during these transients have 
been traditionally identified.
The first one, short in duration, characterized by steep attenuation of stator current Is, called subtran-
sient stage. The second one, larger, and slower in terms of current decay rate is the so-called transient 
stage. Phenomenologically, in the transient stage the transient currents in the rotor damper cage (or solid 
rotor) are already fully attenuated. Subtransient and transient stages are characterized by time constants: 
the time elapsed for a current decay to 1/e = 0.368 from its original value. Based on this observation, 
graphical methods have been developed first to identify the subtransient and transient parameters. As 
short circuits from no load are typical, only the d-axis parameters are obtained in general ( ¢¢
xd, ¢¢
Td , ¢xd, ¢
Td).
In acquiring the armature and field current during short circuit, it is important to use a power switch 
that short circuits all required phases in the same time. Also, noninductive shunts or Hall probe current 
sensors with leads kept close together, twisted or via optical fiber cables to reduce the induced parasitic 
voltages, are to be used.
To avoid large errors and high transient voltage in the field circuit, the latter has to be supplied from 
low-impedance constant voltage supply. For the case of brushless exciters, the field current sensor is 
placed on the rotor and its output is transmitted through special slip-rings and brushes placed on pur-
pose there, or through telemetry; or an observer is built for the purpose.

Testing of Synchronous Generators
If the test is performed below 0.4 p.u., initial voltage Xds is replaced by Xdu (unsaturated); both taken 
from the open-circuit saturation curve.
After subtracting the sinusoidal (steady-state) term in Equation 8.93 the second and third terms may 
be represented in semilogarithmic scales. The rapidly decaying portion of this curve represents the sub-
transient stage, while the straight line is the transient stage (Figure 8.27).
The extraction of rms values of the stator AC short-circuit current components from its recorded 
waveform versus time is now straightforward. If the field current is also acquired the stator armature 
time constant Ta may be determined also. The DC decay stator short circuit current components from 
all three phases may be extracted from the recorded (acquired) data also.
If a constant voltage low-impedance supply to the field winding is not feasible, it is possible to short 
circuit simultaneously the stator and the field winding. In this case both the stator current and the field 
current decay to zero. From the stator view point the constant component in Equation 8.102 has to be 
eliminated. It is also feasible to re-open the stator circuit (after reaching steady short circuit) and record 
the stator voltage recovery.

impedance Xd. A convenient test to identify ¢
Tdo consists of running the machine on armature open 
circuit with the field circuit provided with a circuit breaker and a field discharge contact with a field 
discharge resistance (or freewheeling diode) in series. The field circuit is short-circuited by opening the 
field circuit breaker (Figure 8.28a).
The field current and stator voltage are acquired and represented in a semilogarithmic scale 
(Figure 8.28b).

discharge resistance RD. Consequently the actual ¢

The subtransient open-circuit time constant ¢¢
Tdo may be obtained after a sudden short-circuit test 
when the stator armature circuit is suddenly opened, and the recovery armature differential voltage is 
recorded (Figure 8.29).
The value of ¢¢
Tdo is obtained after subtracting the line C (Figure 8.29) from the differential volt-
age ΔE (recovery rms voltage minus rms steady-state voltage) to obtain curve D, approximated to a 
straight line.
Let us notice that the three-phase short-circuit tests with variants have provided only transient and 
subtransient parameters in axis d.

As it can be seen from Figure 8.30, the DC components of short-circuit currents do not vary in time

may be computerized in itself to speed up the time to extract these parameters from test data that are

Various regression methods have also been introduced to fit the test data to the SG model.
8.8  Transient and Subtransient Parameters from 
d and q Axis Flux Decay Test at Standstill
The standstill flux decay tests in axes d and q provide the variation of id(t), ifd(t) and, respectively, iq(t) 
(Figure 8.31).
This test has been traditionally used to determine—by integration—the initial flux and, thus, the 
synchronous reactances and the turn ratio a.
However, the flux decay transient current responses contain all the transient and subtransient param-
eters. Quite a few methods to process this information and produce ¢¢
xd, ¢xd, ¢¢
xq, ¢¢
Td , ¢
Td, ¢¢
Tq  have been 
proposed.
Among them, we mention here the decomposition of recorded current in exponential compo-
nents [10]:

(8.108)
For the separation of the exponential constants Ij and Tj, a dedicated program based on nonlinear least 
square analysis may be used. Also, the maximum likelihood estimation (ML) has been applied [11] suc-
cessfully to process the flux decay data—id(t), ifd(t)—with two rotor circuits in axes d and q. To initialize 
the process, the graphical techniques described in previous paragraphs [12] have also been applied for 
the scope.
If the tests are performed for low initial currents, there is no magnetic saturation. On the contrary, for 
large (rated) values of initial currents, saturation is present.
It may be argued that during the transients in the machine at speed and on load, the frequency con-
tent of various rotor current differ from the case of standstill flux decay transients. In other words, 
where the transients and subtransient parameters determined from flux decay tests may be applied 
safely? At least they may be safely used to evaluate balanced sudden short-circuit transients.

8.9  Subtransient Reactances from Standstill 
Single-Frequency AC Tests
The subtransient reactances 
¢¢
Xd and 
¢¢
Xq are associated with fast transients, or large frequency 
(Figure 8.32). Consequently, at standstill when supplying the stator line from a single-phase AC 
(at rated frequency) source, the rotor circuits (field winding is short-circuited) experience that fre-
quency. The rotor is placed in axis d by noticing the situation when the AC field current is maximum. 
For axis q, it is zero.
The voltage, current, and power in the stator are measured and thus:

It should be noted, however, that the values of X2 and R2 are not influenced by DC saturation level in 
the rotor that is present during SG on load operation. If solid parts are present in the rotor, the skin 
effect that influences X2 and R2 is notably marked in turn by the DC saturation level in the machine 
at load.

8.10  Standstill Frequency Response Tests
Traditionally, short-circuit tests have been performed to check the SG capability to withstand the corre-
sponding mechanical stresses on the one hand, and to provide for subtransient and transient parameter 
determination to predict transient performance and assist in SG control design, on the other hand.
From these tests, two rotor circuit models are identified: the subtransient and transient submodels—
a damper + field winding along d axis and two damper circuits along axis q.
As already illustrated in previous paragraphs, sudden short-circuit tests do not in general produce the 
transient and subtransient parameters in axis q.
For today’s power system dynamics studies, all parameters along axes d and q are required.
Identifying the two rotor circuit models in axis d and separately in axis q may be performed by stand-
still flux decay tests as illustrated earlier in this chapter.
It seems however that both sudden short-circuit tests and standstill flux decay tests do not completely 
reflect the spectrum of frequencies encountered by SG under load transients when connected to power 
system or in stand-alone mode.
This is how standstill frequency tests have come into play. They are performed separately in axes d and 
q for current levels of 0.5% of rated current and for frequencies from 0.001 to 100 Hz and more.
Not all actual transients in an SG span, this wide-frequency band and thus the identified model from 
SSFR may be centered on the desired frequency zone.
The frequency effects in solid iron-rotor SGs are very important, and thus the second-order rotor 
circuit model may not suffice. A third order in both d and q axes proved to be more adequate.
As all standstill tests, the centrifugal effect on the contact resistance of damper bars (or of conducting 
wedges) to slot walls are not considered though, they may influence notably the identified model, com-
parisons between SSFR and on load frequency response tests for turbogenerators have spotted such dif-
ferences. The saturation level is very low in SSFR tests, while in real SG transients the rotor core is strongly 
DC magnetized and the additional (transient) frequency currents in the solid iron occur in such an iron 
core. The field penetration depth is increased by saturation and the identified model parameters change.
Running SSFR in the presence of increasing DC pre-magnetization through the field current may 
solve the problem of saturation influences on the identified model. Direct current premagnetization is 
required only for frequencies above 1 Hz. Thus the time to apply large DC currents is somewhat limited, 
to limit the temperature rise during such DC + SSFR tests. Recently, Reference [12] seems to demon-
strate such claim. Thus far, however, the pure SSFR tests have been investigated in more detail through 
a very rich literature, and finally standardized [4].
In what follows the standardized version of SSFR is presented with short notes on latest publications 
about the subject [4,13].

It represents the Laplace transform of the field voltage to d-axis current variations when the field wind-
ing is open.
Originally, the second-order rotor circuit model (Figure 8.33, Chapter 5) has been used to fit the SSFR.
The presence of the leakage coupling inductance Lfld introduced in Reference [14] to better represent the 
field winding transients, was found positive in cylindrical solid iron rotors and negative in salient-pole SGs.
In general, the stator leakage inductance Ll is considered known.
For high-power cylindrical solid rotor SGs, third-order models have been introduced (Figure 8.34). 
There is still a strong debate if one or two leakage inductances are required to fully represent such 
a machine, where the skin effect in the solid iron (and in the possible copper damper strips placed 
below the rotor field winding slot wedges) is notable. Eventually, they lead to rather complex frequency 
responses (Figures 8.34 and 8.35) [15].

With the leakage inductance Ll given, it is argued if both Lf12d and Lf2d are necessary to fully represent 
the actual phenomena in the machine. Though linear circuit theory allows for quite a few equivalent 
circuits for same frequency response over some given frequency bands, it seems natural to follow the 
physical phenomena flux paths in the machine (Figure 8.35) [15].
Initially, SSFR methods made use of only stator inductances Ld(ω), Lq(ω) responses. It was soon real-
ized that, simultaneously, the rotor response transfer function G(ω) has to be taken into consideration 
such that the modeling of the transients in the field winding be adequate. In addition, Zafd (jω) is identi-
fied also in some processes if the frequency range of interest is below 1 Hz.
The magnitude and the phase of Ld(jω), Lq(jω), G(jω), and Zaf0(jω) are measured at several frequencies.
The smaller the frequencies, the larger the number of measurements per decade (up to 60) that is 
required for satisfactory precision [16].
SSFR are done at very low current levels (0.5% of base stator current) in order to avoid overheating 
as, at least in the low-frequency range, data acquisition for 2–3 periods requires long time internals 
(f = 0.001–1000 Hz).
Although magnetic saturation of the main flux path is avoided, the SSFR [17] makes the stator and 
rotor iron magnetization process evolve along low amplitude hysteresis cycles where the incremental 
permeability acts μi = (100–150)μo.
Consequently, Lad, Laq identified from SSFR are not to be used as unsaturated values with the machine 
at load.

The time constants to be determined through curve fitting, from SSFR are not necessarily the same as 
those obtained from short-circuit tests (in axis d).
Numerous methods of curve fitting have been proposed [16,18], some requiring the computation of 
gradients and some avoiding them, like the pattern search described in [4].
The direct ML method combining field short-circuit open SSFR in axis d has been shown to produce 
not only the time constants, but the very parameters of the multiple-order models.
Rather straightforward analytical expressions to calculate the third-order model parameters from 
the estimated time constants have been found for the case that Lf2d = 0 (see Figure 8.33) [19].
To shed more light on the phenomenology within the multiple rotor circuit models, a rather intuitive 
method to identify the time constants from SSFR, based on phase responses extremes finding [20], is 
described in what follows.
8.10.3  The SSFR Phase Method
It is widely accepted that second-order circuit models have a bandwidth of up to 5 Hz, and can be easily 
identified from SSFR tests. But even in this case, some simplifications are required, to enable that the 
standard set of short-circuit and open-circuit constants be identified.
With third-order models, such simplifications are not anymore indispensable. While curve fitting 
techniques to match SSFR to the identified model are predominant today, they are not free from short-
comings such as the following:
•	 They define from the start the order for the model
•	 Initiate the curve fitting with initial estimates of time constants
•	 Need to define a cost function and eventually calculate its gradients

453
Testing of Synchronous Generators
Alternatively, it may be possible to identify the time constants pairs T1 < T10, T2 < T20, T3 < T30 Equation 
8.136 from the operational inductances Ld(jω), Lq(jω), jωG(jω), based on the property of lag circuits [20].

The R–L branches in parallel that appear in the equivalent circuit of SGs, make pairs of zeros and poles 
when represented in the frequency domain.
As each pair of zeros and poles form a lag circuit (T1 < T10, T2 < T20, T3 < T30), they may be separated one 
by one from the phase response. Let us denote T1/T10 = α < 1.
The lag circuit main features are as follows:
•	 It has a maximum phase lag φ at the center frequency of the pole zero pair Fc where

The gain change is, in general, insufficient to be usable in the calculation of α, but Equations 8.127 
and 8.139 are sufficient to calculate the zero and pole time constants. Identifying first the maximum 
phase lag points φ (at frequency Fc) is first operated by Equation 8.137. Then, Tpole and Tzero are easily 
determined from Equation 8.139. The number of maximum phase lag points in the SSFR frequency cor-
responds to the order of the equivalent circuit. The process starts by finding the first T1, T10 pair. Then 
they are introduced in the experimentally found Ld(jω) or Lq(jω), and thus eliminated. The order of the 
circuit is reduced by one unit.
The remaining of the phase will be used to find the second zero-pole pair and so on, until the phase 
response left does not contain any maximum.
The order of the equivalent circuit is not given initially but claimed at the end, in accordance with the 
actual SSFR-phase number of maximum phase lag points.
The whole process may be computer programmed easily and ±1 dB gain errors are claimed to be 
characteristic to this method [20].
To further reduce the errors in determining, the value of the maximum phase lag angle φ and the 
frequency at which occurs, Fc, sensitive studies have been performed. They show that an error in Fc pro-
duces a significant error in the time constants Tpole and Tzero; α changes the time constants such that ϕ 
varies notably at same Fc [20].
Therefore,  if Fc is varied above and below the firstly identified value Fci, the Ld(jω) error varies from positive 
to negative values. When this error changes sign the correct value of Fc has been reached (Figure 8.39a). For 
this “correct” value of Fc, the initially calculated value of α is changed up and down until the error changes sign.
The change in sign of phase error (Figure 8.39b) corresponds to the correct value of α. With these 
correct values, the final values of two time constants are obtained. A reduction in errors to ±0.5° and 
respectively, ±0.1 dB are claimed by these refinements.
The equivalent rotor circuit resistances may be calculated from the time constants just determined 
through an analytical solution using a linear transformation [19]. As expected, in such an analytical process 
the stator leakage inductance Ll plays an important role. There is a value of Ll above which the rotor circuit 
leakage inductances become negative. Design values of Ll have been shown to produce good results, however.

454
Synchronous Generators
A few remarks seem in order:
•	 The SSFR phase-lag maxima are used to detect the center frequencies of the zero-pole pairs in the 
multiple circuit model of SG.
•	 The zero-pole pairs are calculated sequentially and then eliminated one by one from the phase 
response until no maximum phase lag is apparent. The order of the circuit model appears at the 
end of the process.
•	 As the initial values of the time constants are determined from the phase-response maxima, the 
process of optimizing their values as developed above leads to a unique representation of the 
equivalent circuit.
•	 It may be argued that the leakage coupling rotor inductances Lfl1d, Lfl2d are not identified in the 
process.
•	 The phase method may at least be used as a very good starting point for the curve-fitting methods 
to yield more physically representative equivalent circuit parameters of SGs.
8.11  Online Identification of SG Parameters
As today SGs tend to be stressed to the limit, even predictions of +5% additional stability margin will be 
valuable as it allows the delivery of about 5% more power safely. To make such predictions in a tightly 
designed SG and power system requires the identification of generator parameters from nondangerous 
online tests such that a sudden variation of field voltage for from one or a few active and reactive power 
levels [21].

Testing of Synchronous Generators
This way, the dynamic parameter identification takes place in conditions closer to those encoun-
tered in even larger transients. During a specific on-load large transient, the parameters of the 
SG-equivalent circuit may be considered constant as identified through an estimation method [22] 
or variable with the level of magnetic saturation and temperature. Intuitively, it seems more accept-
able to assume that magnetic saturation influences some (or all) the inductances in the model, while 
the temperature influences the time constants. The frequency effects are considered traditionally by 
increasing the order of the rotor circuit model (especially for solid rotors). However, in a fast tran-
sient, the skin effect in the stator winding of a large SG may be considerable. Also, during the first 
milliseconds of such of a transient, the laminated core of stator may enter the model with an addi-
tional circuit [23].
When estimating the SG equivalent circuit parameters from rather large online measurements, 
it may be possible to let the parameters (some of them) vary in time though in reality they vary due to 
magnetic saturation level that changes in time during transients.
The stator frequency effects may be considered either by adding one cage circuit to model or by 
letting the stator resistance Ra vary in time during the process [24]. In the postprocessing stage, the 
variable parameters may be expressed as function of, say, field current, power angle, or stator current. 
Such functions may be used in other online transients. Alternatively for stator skin effects consid-
erations, an additional fictitious circuit may be connected in parallel with Ra and Ll (Figure 8.40), 
instead of considering that Ra varies in time during transients. It may be also feasible to adopt a lower-
order circuit model (say second order), perform a few representative online tests and, from all experi-
mental data, determine the parameters. Making use of these parameters values through interpolation 
(artificial neural networks), for example, new transients may be explored safely [25]. Advanced esti-
mation algorithms such as using the concept of synthesized information factor (SIF) [24], artificial 
neural networks [25] or constraint conjugate gradient methods [22], ML [26] have all been used for 
more or less successful validation on large machines under load, via transient responses in power 
angle, filled current, stator current [24]. The jury is still out but, perhaps, soon, an online measure-
ment field strategy, with a pertinent parameter adaptive estimation scheme, will mature enough to 
enter the standards.
8.11.1  A Small-Signal Injection on Line Technique
A rather recent approach to online parameter identification is related to small-signal (current) injection 
by a chopper connected between two phases controlled at about 50% modulation index with two fre-
quencies (ωs ± ωe); ωe ≥ 2π200 rad/s (Figure 8.41) [27]. The 5% p.u. current injection frequency may vary 
between 0.01 Hz and 1 kHz, to cover all frequency range of interest.

The impedances in Equation 8.140 can be traced down to SM dq model parameters and calcu-
lated at various injection frequencies in the chopper. Then an optimization algorithm (GOSET in 
MATLAB®) is used to extract the machine dq model parameters. A comparison with SSFR for the 
investigated 3.7 kW, 230 V, 1800 rpm SM shows good agreement of key parameters. Operational 
impedances xd(s), xq(s) by GOSET (genetic algorithm) and by SSFR agree satisfactorily over the 
entire frequency range (Figure 8.42) [27].
Zero sequence test is needed to approximate the stator leakage inductance, but its design value will 
do, also. Subsequent verification of the method presented here for higher power SGs is still needed 
before its industrialization.

8.11.2  Line Switching (On or Off) Parameter Identification for Isolated Grids
Load rejection method of SG parameter identification (in q axis) is already confirmed in IEEE standard 
1110; while, when complemented with field current decay test (for axis d), it offers all machine dq model 
parameters. Reference [28] develops the dq model of SG with a single input Vf (field winding voltage) by 
adding the RL equivalent load model (Figure 8.43) [28].
In fact, any power grid may be reduced to an RLC load and an emf, so the method may be extended 
to grid connected SGs.

This unique model is used to treat online switching of an inductive load, which implies that the 
steady-state power angle remains zero. No rotor position estimation is thus necessary even if speed 
varies during online switching, but it is available, as it may be introduced in the SG dq voltage/current 
model, with no need for the motion equation.
From the response of online (or load rejection) switching transients with measured currents, constant 
VF, stator voltages, quite a few SG parameters may be obtained by curve fitting (optimization).
An interesting duality between online pure inductive load switching and offline pure capacitive load 
switching is inferred in [28] and may be instrumental in testing for parameter identification.
A cross-identification (validation) of SG parameters between online switching, offline switching, field 
short circuit (field current decay) tests is offered in Reference [29] for a small (1.5 kVA) SG. Although the 
method is easier to apply for small- and medium-power SGs it is worth pursuing it further.
8.11.3  Synthetic Back-to-Back Load Testing with Inverter Supply
Up to 10 MVA SGs are being considered for variable speed wind generators, hydroapplications, and so 
on. These systems use full-power converters.
Testing them, by using the inverter but not coupling them at shaft it may constitute a good advantage 
at manufacturers’ site.
Figure 8.44a shows a typical such arrangement with two identical SGs and their four-quadrant DC–
link AC–AC converters connected to the local power grid.
After both machines are slowly accelerated to speed, to claim small power from the local power grid, 
their delivered power should be set first on zero.
Subsequently, the reference input powers P1* and P2* are synchronously switched from + (generator), 
to − (motoring) such that where one is motor the other is generator. The power switching frequency is 
high enough such that the machines remain at synchronous speed.
The average power extracted in the process from the local power grid is equivalent to the two lines the 
losses in machine + converter system: 2Σp.
Therefore, even the efficiency at different power levels can be obtained:

Testing of Synchronous Generators
The heating test may be done implicitly this way with programmed power levels according to given duty 
cycles are representative for the application.
Note: The above method may be applied also to the PMSGs or DFIGs with PWM bidirectional convert-
ers; even for CRIG with full-power PWM bidirectional converters.
Only one machine and dual converter is needed for standard synthetic loading, but then only the 
average power from the local grid is equal to system losses, while the peak power is experienced by the 
local power grid.
8.12  Summary
•	 A rather complete set of testing methods for synchronous generators (SGs) is presented in IEEE 
Std. 115-1995. IEC has a similar standard.
•	 The SG testing methods may be classified into standardized and research types. The standardized 
tests may be performed for acceptance, performance, or parameters.
•	 Acceptance testing refers to insulation resistance dielectric and partial discharge, resistance mea-
surements, identifying short-circuited field turns, polarity of field poles, shaft currents and bear-
ing insulation, phase sequence TIF (balanced, residual, line-to-neutral) stator terminal voltage 
waveform deviation and distortion factors, overspeed tests, line discharging (maximum absorbed 
kVA at zero power factor with zero field current), and acoustic noise. They were presented in some 
detail in this chapter following, in general, IEEE Std. 115-1996.
•	 Testing SG for performance refers to saturation curves, segregated losses, power angle, and 
efficiency.
•	 The individual loss components are as follows:
•	 Friction and windage loss
•	 Core loss (on open circuit)
•	 Stray load loss (on short circuit)
•	 Stator winding loss
•	 Field winding loss
•	 To identify the magnetic saturation curves and then segregate the loss components, to finally 
calculate efficiency under load, four methods have gained wide acceptance:
•	 Separate driving method
•	 Electric input method
•	 Retardation method
•	 Heat transfer method
•	 The separate driving method is based on the concept of driving the SG at precisely controlled 
(or rated) speed by an external, low rating (<5% of SG rating) motor, or by the exciter (if it con-
tains an electric machine on shaft) or by the prime mover itself. With the SG driven at rated 
speed, on open stator circuit, the field current, stator voltage, and the driving motor output are 
measured for increasing values of field current, until the stator terminal voltage reaches at least 
125% of rated value. The open-circuit saturation curve is thus obtained. In addition, as the driv-
ing motor output is considered known, the field current may be made zero, and thus the friction 
and windage losses are measured. From the open-circuit run, where both friction and windage 
and core losses occur, the core loss for various values of terminal voltage is obtained. The same 
arrangement may be used to determine the short-circuit saturation curve and then stray load 
losses for currents levels from 125% to 25% of rated current, if the winding resistance is known 
from previous measurements. With all loss components known, the efficiency versus power out-
put may be calculated.
•	 The electrical input method is very similar to the separate driving method, but this time the SG 
itself works as a synchronous motor without a mechanical load.

Synchronous Generators
•)>> In retardation tests, the uncoupled SG is brought at 105%–110% of rated speed and then left to 
decelerate in three different situations:
)>>
(a))>> Open circuit stator, zero field current, to measure friction and windage loss Pfw;
)>>
(b))>> Open circuit stator, constant field current, to measure friction and windage loss + core loss: 
Pfw + Pcore;
)>>
(c))>> Short circuit stator, constant field current, to measure friction and windage + stator winding 
+ stray-load losses: Pcu1 + Pstrayload + Pfw.
琀
屴The inertia may be obtained from run (a), with Pfw already known, from the motion equation, by 
calculating the speed slowing rate around rated speed. Speed has to be recorded. Then, from runs 
(b) and (c), Pcore and Pstrayload may be segregated.
•)>> The other purpose of steady-state tests is to determine the steady-state parameters of SG and the 
field current under specified load.
•)>> The leakage reactance Xl is approximated usually to the Potier reactance Xp obtained from a rated 
current zero-power-factor tests at rated voltage. As Xp > Xl at rated voltage, the same test is per-
formed at 110% rated voltage when Xp approaches Xl.
•)>> A procedure to estimate Xl as the average between the zero sequence (homopolar) reactance 
Xo(Xo < Xl) and the reactance without the rotor inside the stator bore Xlair, is introduced. Alternatively, 
from Xlair the bore air volume reactance Xair may be subtracted to obtain the leakage reactance. Xair 
is proportional to the unsaturated uniform air gap reactance Xadu; Xair ~ Xadu × gKcπ/τ: Xl = Xlair − Xair.
•)>> The excitation current at specified load-active and reactive power and voltage is determined by 
the Potier diagram method. Magnetic saturation is considered the same in both axes. The power 
angle is needed for the scope and is computed by using the unsaturated values of quadrature axis 
reactance, Xqu of Equation 8.29.
•)>> From the simplified transient SG phasor diagram (Figure 8.14), the excitation current for stability 
studies is obtained.
•)>> Voltage regulation—the difference between no-load voltage and terminal voltage for specified 
load and same field current—is calculated based on the computed field current at specified load.
•)>> The power angle may be measured by encoders or other mechanical sensors. The power angle is 
the electrical angle between the terminal voltage and the field produced emf.
•)>> Temperature tests are required to verify the SG capability to deliver the rated or more power 
under conditions agreed upon by vendor and buyer. Four methods are described:
•)>> Conventional (direct) loading
•)>> Synchronous feedback (back-to-back) loading
•)>> Zero-power-factor tests
•)>> Open-circuit running plus short-circuit “loading”
•)>> While direct loading may be done by manufacturer only for small- and medium-power SGs, the 
same test may be performed after commissioning, with the machine at power grid for all power 
levels.
•)>> Back-to-back loading implies the presence of two coupled identical SGs with their rotors dis-
placed mechanically by 2δN/p1. The stator circuits of the two machines are connected together. 
One machine acts as a motor, the other as a generator. If an external low rating motor is driving 
the MS + SG set, then the former covers the losses in the two machines 2∑P. Care must be exer-
cised to make the losses fully equivalent with those occurring with the SG under specified load.
•)>> The zero-power-factor load tests implies that the SG works as a “synchronous capacitor” (motor-
ing at zero-mechanical-load). Again loss equivalence with actual conditions has to be observed.
•)>> The open-circuit stator test for the field current at specified load is run and the temperature rise 
until thermal steady state, Δtoc, is measured. Further on, the short-circuit test at rated current is 
run until new thermal steady state is obtained for a temperature rise of Δtsc. The SG total tempera-
ture is Δtoc + Δtsc minus the temperature differential due to mechanical loss, which is duplicated 
during the tests.

461
Testing of Synchronous Generators
•)>> All these tests imply efforts and have shortcomings, but the temperature rise for specified load is 
so important for SG life that it has to be measured even if sophisticated FEM thermal-electromag-
netic models of SGs is now available.
•)>> Besides steady-state performance, behavior under transients conditions is also important to pre-
dict. To this scope, the SG parameters for transients have to be identified. Power system stability 
studies rely on SG parameters knowledge.
•)>> PER-UNIT values are used in parameter definitions to facilitate more generality in results refer-
ring to SG of various power levels. Only three base independent quantities are in general required: 
voltage, current, and frequency.
•)>> For the rotor, Rankin has defined a new base field current ifdbase = Ifdbase × Xadu. Ifdbase is the field cur-
rent (reduced to the stator) that produces the rated voltage on the straight line of no-load saturation 
curve. Xadu is the unsaturated d-axis coupling reactance (in p.u.) between stator and rotor wind-
ings. Rankin’s reciprocal system produces equal stator to field and field to stator p.u. reactances.
•)>> The steady-state parameters Xd, Xq may be determined by a few carefully designed tests without 
loading the SG. Quadrature axis reactance Xq is more difficult to segregate, but pure Iq loading of 
the machine method provides for the Xq values.
•)>> SGs may work with unbalanced load either when connected to the power system or in stand-alone 
mode. For steady state, by the method of symmetrical components, the value of Z2(X2) may be 
found from a steady-state line to line short circuit. The elimination of the third harmonics from 
the measured voltage is crucial in obtaining acceptable precision with this testing method.
•)>> The zero sequence (homopolar) reactance Xo is measured from a standstill AC tests with all stator 
phases in series or in parallel. In general, Xo ≤ Xl. A two line to neutral short-circuit tests will also 
provide for Xo.
•)>> The short-circuit ratio SCR = 1/Xd = IFNL/IFSI. IFSI id the field current from the three-phase short-
circuit (at rated stator current). IFNL is the field current at rated voltage and open-circuit test. SCR 
has today typical values of 0.4−0.6 for high-power SGs.
•)>> Due to magnetic saturation and its cross-coupling effect—all the methods to determine the 
steady-state parameters thus far need special corrections to fit the results from direct on load 
­measurements. Families of flux/current curves for axis d and q are required to be obtained from 
special operation mode tests, in order to have enough data to cope with on-load various situations.
•)>> Standstill flux decay tests may provide the required flux/current families of curves. They imply 
short-circuiting the stator or field circuits and recording the currents. The tests are done in axis d 
or q or in a given rotor position.
•)>> Integrating the resistive voltage drop in time, the initial (DC) flux linkage is obtained. Care must 
be exercised to avoid hysteresis caused errors and to DC measure the resistance before each new 
test in order to eliminate temperature rise errors.

Tqo—two main types 
of tests have been standardized:
•)>> Sudden three-phase short-circuit tests
•)>> SSFR
•)>> Three-phase sudden short circuit is used to identify the above parameters of a second-order model 
of SG in both, axis d and axis q. The methods to extract the parameters, from stator phase cur-
rents and field current recording, are essentially either graphical with mechanization by computer 
programs [27] or regression type.
•)>> Third-order models are required, especially in SGs with solid rotors, due to skin effect strong 
dependence on frequency in solid bodies.
•)>> Alternatively, there are proposals to determine the parameters for transients from the already 
mentioned standstill DC flux decay tests, by processing the time variation of currents or voltages 
during these tests. Though good results have been reported, the method has not met yet world-
wide acceptance due to insufficient documentation.

462
Synchronous Generators
•)>> SSFR tests use quite similar arrangements with DC flux decay tests. The SG is fed with about 0.5% 
rated currents at frequencies from 0.001 to 100 Hz and more. The input voltage, stator current, field 
current rms values, and phase lags are measured. The tests take time as at least 2–3 periods have 
to be recorded at each frequency.
•)>> In general, the amplitude of the operational parameters Ld(jω), Lq(jω), G(jω), Zafo(jω) is used to 
extract the parameters of the third-order model along axes d and q: ¢¢¢

, , the stator resistance Ra, field winding resistance Rfd, the turns ratio between rotor 
and stator a. Numerous curve fitting methods have been introduced and improved steadily up to 
the present time.
•)>> The presence of one or two leakage mutual rotor reactances in the third-order model, with the 
leakage stator reactance Xl given a priori, is still a matter of debate.
•)>> These reactances seem mandatory (at least one of them) to represent correctly, in the same time, 
the transient behavior of SGs seen from stator circuit and from the field current side.
•)>> The up-to-now less-favored information from SSFR the phase response versus frequency has 
been recently put to work to identify the third model of SG [20]. The method is based on the 
observation that the phase response corresponds to zero/pole pairs in the model’s transfer func-
tion. By using the center frequency FC and the value of response phase φ, these maximum phase 
zero/pole pairs—that is time constants—are calculated rather simply. They are then corrected 
until only very low errors persist. After the first pair is identified, its circuits are eliminated from 
the response. The search for phase maximum continues until no maximum persists. The model 
order comes thus at the end. Determining the resistances and reactances of the SG multiple cir-
cuit model, from transient reactances to time constants, may be done by regression methods. 
Analytical resistance expressions have also been found for the third-order models [19].
•)>> Some verifications of SSFR validity for various large on-load transients have been made. Still, this 
operation seems yet insufficiently documented, especially for solid rotor SGs.
•)>> Online SG model identification methods, based on same nondamaging transients on load 
(i.e., up to 30% step field voltage change response at various load conditions) have been introduced 
recently. Artificial neural networks and other learning methods may be used to extend the model 
thus obtained to new transients, based on a set of representative on load tests.
•)>> While these very complex online adaptive parameter identification methods go on, there are still 
hopes that simpler methods such as standstill flux decay tests, standstill DC + SSFR tests, or load 
recovery tests may be improved to the point to become fully reliable for large on-load transients.
•)>> A small signal injection method between two phases through a chopper, with SG on load has been 
shown recently to produce good results with reasonable effort [27].
•)>> Similarly, good results are claimed with an on–off line switching method [28].
•)>> Important developments are expected in SG testing in the near future as theory, software, and 
hardware are continuously upgraded through worldwide efforts by industry and academia. These 
efforts are driven by power quality ever more demanding standards. As an example, a synthetic 
back-to-back loading test of SGs with AC–DC–AC converters and low local power grid rating was 
presented in Section 8.10.3.
