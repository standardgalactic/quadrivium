Dedication
To my beloved life partner, Paloma, without whom none of this would be pos-
sible (and not nearly as much fun), and my number one son, Quinn, through
whose eyes I see the world anew each day.
Author’s Acknowledgments
The fact that you’re holding this book right now is more a testament to the
multitude of people who made it possible than just the person who put the
words to paper. 
My deepest thanks go to Pete Bauer, for not only taking me on to the NAPP
Help Desk, mentoring me over the years, and providing support during the
writing of this book, but for opening doors to new worlds. I owe a special
debt of gratitude to my Help Desk counterpart Jeanne Rubbo, who undoubt-
edly picked up my slack over the last few months! Of course, without NAPP I
would not be where I am today, and so I would also like to extend my thanks
to Scott and Kalebra Kelby, Jim Workman, Jean Kendra, Larry Becker, Jeff
Kelby, and Dave Moser for creating and maintaining the most amazing profes-
sional resource I have had the pleasure of being associated with. I am also
grateful to all the NAPP members who have sent in their Photoshop and
Lightroom questions over the years; you served as the voice in the back of
my mind as I wrote.
My undying gratitude goes to the awesome team at Wiley. To the folks I worked
with directly, Bob Woerner, Paul Levesque, Brian Walls, and Steve Holmes, as
well as all those behind the scenes, many thanks for your patience, support,
professionalism, and most of all, for making this all come together! 
Thanks to the Lightroom team at Adobe for mixing your passion and bril-
liance into this fantastic tool for digital photographers.
To all my friends at iStockphoto for starting me down a path so many years
ago that has led me to this point in time. There are too many to name, but
extra special thanks to Bruce Livingstone, Pete Rockwell, Pat Lor, and every-
one who has ever made me “lol” in the forums.
All my love to my wife, Paloma, my son Quinn, and the rest of my family and
friends for keeping the coffee ﬂowing, putting up with late nights, making me
get out of my chair at regular intervals, and generally taking such good care
of me. We did it!

Photoshop Lightroom 2 For Dummies 

Introduction
A
dobe Photoshop Lightroom — more commonly referred to simply as
Lightroom — has made an incredible impact on the digital photography
world in a very short time. The reason it has made such a splash is due in
large part to the fact that the folks behind Lightroom started out by taking a
step back and looking at all the tasks today’s photographers are required to
perform with their digital photos. The Lightroom team wanted to know how
they could make the process of taking a photo from camera to finished
output as efficient as possible while still holding to a level of quality that pro-
fessionals demand. They also wanted a means to equally accommodate the
surge in photographers turning to shooting in raw mode (where the camera
saves the photo data to the memory card, but stops short of processing that
data to make it look better), as well as all the photographers who still rely on
working with photos in JPEG format (where the camera captures the data and
processes it based on the in-camera settings).
What the Lightroom team found was that (unsurprisingly) photographers
wanted to spend more time shooting and less time in front of their comput-
ers. Photographers wanted to have a great deal of control over how their
photos were managed, edited, and prepared for output, but they wanted the
process to be intuitive and visual. Photographers wanted tools that would
help them make the most of the photo data that was captured by their cam-
eras, and they wanted consistent output across display mediums (computer
screen and prints). Like any group of people they wanted the best of all
worlds, and who could blame them!
In rising to meet this challenge, a new way of thinking about how we photo-
graphers work with our photos emerged. The old model of having one pro-
gram for downloading photos, another for managing them, one program for
editing raw photos and another for JPG was just growing too cumbersome to
meet today’s (and tomorrow’s) demands. The result of this new way of think-
ing was Lightroom — a single application designed to encompass all the
tasks photographers face (what Lightroom refers to as a photographer’s
workflow), and present them in a seamless, logical, and visual manner.
Unifying those tasks under a single interface was significant in and of itself,
but the real difference Lightroom brings to the table is in what lies under its
hood — a database. Referred to as a “catalog” in Lightroom terms, the data-
base at Lightroom’s core is where everything (and I do mean everything) you
do to your photos gets stored, and the value it brings is twofold in that it is
much faster to read and write to a database than it is to change the actual
pixels in your photos, and that it is completely nondestructive since your
original source photos are never changed. This approach represents a para-
digm shift in digital photo management and editing!

2
Photoshop Lightroom 2 For Dummies 
While paradigm shifts offer new ways of doing things and the potential of
improved workflows, they can sometimes be disorienting and frustrating to
come to terms with at first. My hope is that this book can serve as a resource
to keep you out of trouble, on task, and moving forward as you use Lightroom
to take your photos from camera to output over and over again.
About This Book
I am more than just a user of Lightroom. Between my roles on the NAPP Help
Desk and teaching other photographers, and my participation in various
Lightroom groups, forums, and beta testing, I’ve worked with thousands of
photographers. I’ve tried to understand the problems they faced, and I’ve
helped them find solutions. I wrote this book with the intention of trying to
prevent you from encountering the same problems that others have stum-
bled on, while also sharing the collective wisdom I’ve gained to make your
workflow as efficient as possible.
How This Book Is Organized
Lightroom is a workflow tool by design, and within the macro workflow of
capture to output there exist countless smaller workflows that cover all the
micro tasks every photographer needs to complete. The very concept of a
workflow implies that there is both a natural beginning and a finite end. I
mean, you can’t start editing a photo if you haven’t first pressed the shutter,
right? 
I organize this book with the larger Lightroom workflow in mind, but each
chapter — and even the sections within a chapter — represent all the smaller
workflows that make up the larger whole. So, although there’s something to
be gained from following the structure I lay out in the book, if you’re new to
Lightroom, my hope is that you can pick up this book when you need it and
jump right to the place in your workflow that you want to learn more about.
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success
If you’re new to Lightroom — or new to digital photography — you’ll defi-
nitely want to spend some time in Part I. I’ve seen too many people get off on
the wrong foot with Lightroom and lose time (and sleep) trying to get them-
selves back on track because they didn’t get a few basic concepts under their
belt first. I’ve helped quite a few folks get back on track and I know some of
the more common pitfalls, so here’s your chance to benefit from my past
experience so you can spend more time productively working with your
photos.

Part II: Managing Your Photos
Managing data might be the least sexy part of a photographer’s workflow;
however, it’s possibly the most essential. Considering that the volume of
photos we photographers are all producing is increasing each year, this is an
aspect of the workflow you have no choice but to get right.
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom
This part is where you work to realize the vision you had the moment the
shutter clicked. For some, it’s as much fun as the capture, but for others, it’s
a chore to accomplish the greatest quality in the least amount of time.
Lightroom can meet the needs of both kinds of people.
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World
Unless you’re satisfied with the process of only making photographs, you’re
going to require some form of output and sharing that extends beyond just
your eyeballs. Lightroom offers several routes to output, and each has its place.
Part V: The Part of Tens
I want to achieve three things with this part of the book: I want to arm you
with the best Lightroom resources available; I want you to become your own
help desk; and I want to share some of my favorite Lightroom tips that I can’t
fit into other parts of the book. This is my favorite section, and I hope it helps
to round out your experience with what came before in the previous four
parts of this book.
Conventions Used in This Book
Lightroom is wonderfully identical on both Windows and Mac operating sys-
tems. I use both operating systems daily, but I create the majority of screen
captures in Windows because it’s been my experience that there are just
more Windows users out there in the world. However, I do include Mac cap-
tures where needed to highlight the few places where there are minor differ-
ences in the interface or dialog boxes.
In the case of keyboard shortcuts (and there are many), I lead off with the
Windows shortcut and always include the Mac shortcut in parentheses right
after. All the shortcuts that don’t require an additional modifier key are the
same on both platforms.
In regards to menu commands, I use the convention of separating each menu
command with this cute arrow, ➪. For example, I tell you to choose File➪Exit
to close the application.

Icons Used in This Book
Scattered throughout this book you find some nifty little icons that point out
bits of information that are especially useful, important, or noteworthy.
You see this icon the most. I include many tips to help you get the most from
each aspect of the program. 
There aren’t many of these (thankfully). I only use them when there’s a
chance you might lose data if you aren’t careful.
Whenever a certain piece of information isn’t particularly intuitive — but
very important to keep in mind — I add this icon to help it stand out.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re just starting out, then my advice to you is to visit Part I sooner
rather than later. Beyond that, this book is intended to be a reference that
you can rely on when you find yourself stuck or that you can use proactively
to avoid the most common pitfalls before you go in.
If you’re interested in getting some live peer support while you explore what
Lightroom has to offer, jump straight to the back of the book and get involved
in the Lightroom communities I introduce in Chapter 14.

enjamin Franklin famously said, “An ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Clearly,
he didn’t have Lightroom in mind, but after helping
many people out of the same pitfalls over and over
again, I implore you to take those words to heart
before you jump into Lightroom. It isn’t the things
we don’t know that often get us into trouble, but
rather the things we think we know but get wrong.
In Part I, I try to condense the wisdom of those
who have gone before you, and although experi-
ence can be an excellent teacher, there’s no harm
in starting out on the right foot.
Chapter 1 introduces you to Lightroom and
enables you to ﬁnd your way around while you
move forward. From there, I try to demystify what
happens under the Lightroom hood and clear up
some wrong assumptions that can lead to confu-
sion when working with the Lightroom catalog
(database) model. I wrap up Part I with a review of
the essential digital imaging concepts that every
Lightroom user should be familiar with before get-
ting in too deep.

A
dobe Photoshop Lightroom — from this point, Lightroom, because that’s
what everybody really calls it — is a workflow tool for digital photogra-
phers. Digital photography has come a long way in recent years. The increasing
number of people who are moving from shooting in JPG format — where the
camera processes the data captured by the sensor and produces a JPG file — to
shooting raw — where you take over processing the “raw” capture data
to create the type of file you need — has created a huge need for
tools to help manage the processing of large numbers of raw
files. Lightroom is not just a raw processing tool though!
You can tweak and adjust JPG, TIF, and PSD files, too. And
that’s just the thing. We have so many files and file
types that need to be managed, processed, and deliv-
ered! Although many raw-processing applications are
on the market, few are as ambitious, multifaceted, and
well designed as Lightroom. Add to the mix the idea
of an integrated workflow application and you have
real state-of-the-art software.
Okay, I’ve dropped the term workflow twice now. It’s
probably time to get my definition out in the open
because you’re going to hear me repeat it quite often
throughout this book. The goal of a workflow is to increase
efficiency when it comes to carrying out the necessary (but often
repeatable and at times unexciting) steps required to complete a task. One
way to streamline your process is to increase efficiency in the transitions that
occur as you move from task to task. Another way is to develop a repeatable
methodology for how you do things, so that you always start with task A,
then move to task B, and so on. By developing a well-thought out procedure,
you don’t lose time wondering what to do next or forgetting where you’ve

been. Lightroom comes to our aid on both counts. By providing a unified
interface for the full spectrum of digital photography tasks, you aren’t jug-
gling three or four different applications at the same time. You can literally
plug your camera into one end of Lightroom and produce prints, Web galleries,
and more from the other. At the same time, each area — called a module —
inside of Lightroom is structured to create a logical “start to finish” flow, which
makes it really easy to know where you are and where you go next, and that’s
what a workflow is all about.
Adding Lightroom to Your Photo Toolkit
A photographer at any experience level is going to be carting around a seri-
ous amount of gear. Even the accessories have accessories! Although some
photographers might derive some pleasure from getting new gear (okay,
maybe a lot of pleasure), this stuff isn’t cheap! So, each new addition to the
family should pass muster and be worthy of being included. Here are some
things I try to consider before adding new stuff:
 Is it well supported?
 Does it play nicely with others?
 What can it do?
 What can’t it do?
Of course, money is a big factor in any purchasing process, but I assume that
if you’re at this stage in the decision-making process you’ve already
accounted for your budget. I’m sure you have other considerations as well,
but let me address how Lightroom stacks up in my experience. 
Is it well supported?
Lightroom first appeared on the scene as a beta release back in January 2006,
meaning it was incomplete but functional (although not without bugs) soft-
ware that was free to use and test drive. Over the course of this beta phase
(which lasted a year), Adobe was very keen for feedback and the Lightroom
development team was actively engaged with the users of the product in a
dedicated online discussion forum. Several improved beta versions were
released before the final version 1.0 was made available in February 2007. Not
only did a better product emerge from this process, but also a community of
highly proficient Lightroom users evolved and is still growing strong. An
incredible amount of tips, tricks, tutorials, and troubleshooting help has
become available online from both Adobe and various users of the product
because of this collaborative process. 
You can find out more about how to get involved with the Lightroom commu-
nity and where to find the best-available Lightroom resources in Chapter 14.
Trust me; Lightroom is an incredibly well-supported product!

Does it play nicely with others?
Tools don’t operate in a vacuum. At the very least, any new tools you adopt
need to coexist with and complement your existing toolset. At the end of the
day, new tools should help you get more from your old tools by helping you
become more efficient, producing better results all around.
Image-editing applications, such as Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, have
long been required for working with digital images because you have to push
pixels around even when you’re just shooting film and scanning. You might have
had to correct for red-eye, crop to a new aspect ratio, enhance colors, remove
spots, convert to grayscale, or do any number of other routine tasks. Whenever
such a task came up, you always turned to your image editor of choice to get
the job done — and you’ll want to continue being able to do so in the future.
To sift through all those photos on your hard drive, you’ve undoubtedly used
some type of file browser like Windows Explorer, Finder, or Adobe Bridge.
You might have also used that file browser for routine maintenance tasks like
renaming, moving, and deleting files. Perhaps you also used one of these
applications for copying files from your memory card to your hard drive.
You’ve worked out routines, you know what each tool accomplishes and you
know where to find everything. Along comes Lightroom and people rightfully
ask, “How will this fit into my routine?” More to the point, folks want to know
whether they have to give up something they like in adopting Lightroom and
be stuck with doing some tasks in less-productive ways. In hopes of alleviat-
ing some of those worries, here’s a closer look at how Lightroom stacks up
against the image editors and file browsers that you know and use every day.
How Lightroom differs from Photoshop and Adobe Bridge
You can get by without Lightroom — I mean, people managed without
Lightroom until recently, right? You can switch between Adobe Bridge (file
browser) and Photoshop (image editor), can throw in an FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) application when you need to upload Web galleries, or even use a
third-party printing application when you want more control over print layouts
than what Photoshop provides. You can always cobble together something, but
wouldn’t it be much more efficient if you could just use a single interface to
import your photos from your memory card, add vital metadata, cull the clunk-
ers, rate and group the keepers, throw together a slideshow, upload a Web
gallery, and print out a contact sheet? What if you could do all that — and even
save steps and settings as reusable shortcuts — from one application?
Wouldn’t that change everything about how you work with your digital
photos? Yes, of course! This is where Lightroom comes in. As a workflow tool,
Lightroom takes over the management of your photos at the point you’re
copying them from your memory card and then brings them all the way to
output and delivery.
Since I began using Lightroom, I’ve all but abandoned Adobe Bridge for view-
ing and interacting with my photos. As a file browser, Bridge is a superior
9
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

10
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
tool to Lightroom in many ways except one; Bridge can only show you what
you point it at, as Bridge doesn’t retain any information about what it has
seen in the past. Comparatively, Lightroom is database driven, which means
that after you introduce it to your photos (via an “import” process) it remem-
bers everything about them. Being able to leverage the power of a database
adds tremendous muscle to the management and processing of your photos.
With regard to editing photos, many people rightly wonder if Lightroom is an
adequate replacement for Photoshop. Although I use Photoshop less now
that I’m using Lightroom, Photoshop (or another image editor) is still a vital
part of my toolkit — as I make clear in a sec. As a raw processor, though,
Lightroom is able to leverage its database to work faster and smarter than
the combination of Adobe Camera Raw and Photoshop. Because Lightroom
and Camera Raw share essentially the same processing engine, you get all the
benefits of Camera Raw built into Lightroom.
What kind of benefits, you ask? Okay, time for brass tacks: As an image
processor, Lightroom can accomplish many tasks normally done by image
editors or other raw photo processors, including the following:
 Setting white balance
 Making tonal adjustments
 Reducing noise
 Enhancing colors
 Cropping
 Applying sharpening
Not bad, right? Yet, although Lightroom covers a lot of ground, it can’t do every-
thing you might want to do with your photos. At times, you might need a pixel-
editing application in your digital photo toolbox. If you need to perform any of
the following tasks, for example, Lightroom would not be your tool of choice:
 Working with selections
 Stitching together panoramas
 Creating high dynamic range photos
 Working with filters
 Combining multiple photos into one
Adobe Photoshop is the prime tool to complement Lightroom. It gives you
the most power and offers the greatest functionality (and tightest integration
with Photoshop CS3). However, if you don’t need that much power (or don’t
want to spend that much money), consider Photoshop Elements the next
best option. Although not as full featured as its big brother, Elements can
push pixels with the best of them. (Truth be told, when you consider all the
features in Lightroom against your own needs, you may find that you won’t
need anything else for most of your work.)

Checking out the Lightroom Modules
Lightroom was built using a modular architecture, which means that Lightroom
comprises a set of unique applications that share a common interface and that
access a common database (or catalog, as Lightroom calls it). Each of the appli-
cations is referred to as a module, and Lightroom has five.
None of these modules can function outside of Lightroom. Although tightly
integrated, they each have a set of unique menus, panels, and tools that tailor
to the specific function each module is designed to handle.
I drill down into the specific panels, tools, and menus in the chapters ahead,
but for now, I’m going to do the overview thing by taking a stab at what
makes each module unique and then showing you how to get the most out of
the common interface they all share.
What makes each module unique
Lightroom has five modules — but the beauty of modular construction is that
the potential exists for more (perhaps many more) to be added. Adobe has
opened only limited aspects of Lightroom’s guts to third-party developers
(just export functionality so far), and the outcome has been very positive. 
The potential for extending Lightroom’s functionality in the future is some-
thing to look forward to, but there’s already plenty of power under the hood.
Here’s a list of the five modules you find in Lightroom:
 The Library module: Your organizational hub, the Library module (see
Figure 1-1) is where many of your Lightroom sessions will start and end.
Common Library module tasks include
• Keywording and metadata entry
• File moving, deletion, and renaming
• Finding, sorting, and grouping
 The Develop module: The bulk of your image processing takes place in
the Develop module. Armed with a powerful array of image-adjustment
tools, as shown in Figure 1-2, common Develop module tasks include
• Setting white balance and tonal adjustments
• Adjusting contrast and color
• Reducing noise and capture sharpening
• Cropping and adjusting crooked horizons
• Removing red-eye and sensor spots

Figure 1-1: The Library module.
Figure 1-2: The Develop module.

 The Slideshow module: The aptly named Slideshow module, shown in
Figure 1-3, is for creating presentations of your photos. The tools in this
module allow you to
• Adjust slideshow layout
• Adjust slide transitions
• Set the show to music
 The Print module: If you print photos, you’ll soon find the Print module,
as shown in Figure 1-4, to be a valuable addition to your printing work-
flow. Here you find controls for
• Creating layouts and print packages
• Using output-specific color profiles to ensure the best-looking prints
(Chapters 3 and 13 cover profiles in greater depth)
• Printing to a local printer or to a JPG file
 The Web module: Getting your photos online in some capacity is a
requirement these days. The Web module, as shown in Figure 1-5, allows
you to manage your Web presence by letting you
• Choose from various photo gallery styles
• Configure the look and feel of your Web gallery
• Upload directly to your Web server

What the modules have in common
Having all modules share parts of a common interface might make it harder
(at first glance) to tell which module is which, but I wouldn’t worry too much
about that. Clarity will reign supreme when you have Lightroom up and run-
ning. Think of it this way: A common interface is in fact one of Lightroom’s
greatest strengths because keeping the same interface means you don’t have
to spend time learning five different interfaces! The interface behaves the
same and shares the same basic structure no matter where you are.
Check out Figure 1-6 to see what I mean. The Library module shown there
sports the following standard interface components — components that each
module shares:
 The Title bar: Provides an at-a-glance view of the name of the catalog
and the module you’re in.
 The Menu bar: The go-to place for all the commands needed for each
module’s tasks.
 The Module Picker: An easy method to pick the module you want to
work with. This area of the interface is also home to the Identity Plate on
the left, which you can customize to insert your own graphic, as well as
the progress meter that appears when Lightroom performs a task. (For
more on the Identity Plate, check out Chapter 5.)
 The Left Panel group: Although the content varies with each module,
the panels to the left of the interface are generally functions that involve
accessing, grouping, and previewing photos and templates.
 The Right Panel group: The panels to the right of the interface also vary
with each module, but this is where you find controls for adjusting and
tweaking.
 The Toolbar: Each module has its own set of tools, but the Toolbar is a
staple of every module.
 The Filmstrip: At the bottom of every module, you always find the
Filmstrip, which displays thumbnails of the image grouping you are
working with. It also is home to a row of tools — right there along the
top — that put a lot of things at your fingertips no matter what module
you are in:
• Main and Second Window controls. Click and hold either of these
window icons to access a number of shortcuts for controlling each
window (more details on the second window function later in the
chapter).
• Jump to Grid view icon. No matter where you are in Lightroom, one
click takes you to Grid view in the Library module. 
15
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

16
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
• Go Back and Forward buttons. Allow you to navigate between previ-
ously selected image groupings (folders, collections, searches) you
have been viewing. 
• Filmstrip Source Indicator. Provides an at-a-glance view of the cur-
rent image grouping and active photo. Click the drop-down arrow
at the end for quick access to the special collections found in
the Catalog panel as well as a list of recently visited folders and
collections.
• Filters. When clicked, the Filter label expands to reveal ways to
filter the current image grouping by flag, rating, or color label. The
Custom Filter drop-down menu provides quick access to all of the
Filter Bar options. The last button on the right toggles filtering on
and off.

Controlling the interface
Lightroom’s interface has a number of options for reducing and simplifying
the workspace. Here’s an example: My publishers forced me to capture the
images of Lightroom in this book at a screen resolution of 1024 x 768 (don’t
ask me why), so things are looking a little cramped. No way would I work at
this resolution, though — I’d naturally bump it up to the highest resolution
my monitor supports so I could have as much space to work with as possi-
ble. However, sometimes there’s just not enough room for everything the
interface has to offer — usually those times when you really just want to give
as much screen real estate to your photos as possible. Imagine trying to work
on a project in your shop and being forced to lay all your tools in neat rows
on the workbench — I guess it’s handy, but you surely won’t have as much
space as you’d like for the project you’re working on. Lightroom has some
pretty clever ways of tweaking how your tools are displayed so you can maxi-
mize the size of your workspace.
The simplest way to maximize space is to take advantage of working in Full
Screen mode. Just like any application you currently use, you’re just a key-
stroke away from maximizing Lightroom to fill the available screen. The neat
thing about Lightroom, though, is that it takes this maximizing business a
step further by providing two separate Full Screen modes in addition to the
Standard Screen mode:
 Full Screen with Menu: With this option, Lightroom expands to fill the
screen and hide its title bar to gain more space. The Menu bar jumps to
the top of the screen. Note that the standard Minimize, Maximize, and
Close buttons vanish from the top of the window in this mode.
 Full Screen: With this option, Lightroom expands to take over the
screen completely. The Menu bar disappears and the taskbar in
Windows (the Dock on a Mac) isn’t accessible.
 Standard Screen: All options are visible and the Lightroom interface can
be resized and moved by grabbing the edge of the window just like any
other application.
To switch between the three screen modes just press the F key to jump from
one view to another. Keep in mind, though, that if it appears as if you “lost”
the Minimize, Maximize, and Close buttons at the top of the window (the
horror!), what’s really happened is that you’ve simply entered one of the Full
Screen modes. (I can’t tell you how many panicked e-mails I’ve received from
folks who believe they’ve somehow lopped off said buttons by mistake,
asking whether I could please help them get back their buttons.)
If you still want more space, you can take advantage of the collapsible nature
of the Module Picker, Panel groups, and Filmstrip. Refer back to Figure 1-6 for
a sec. Do you see the small arrow in the center of the outer edge of each side
of the interface? Clicking an arrow once causes that panel to “hide” from
view. Now, move your cursor away and then back over any part of that edge
and the hidden panel returns, giving you access to the contents of the panel
17
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

18
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
until you move the cursor away again! This is called “Auto Hide & Show.”
Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) an arrow and you can see the other pos-
sible choices:
 Auto Hide: When enabled, that panel automatically hides when you
move your cursor away from it, but it won’t show again until you click
the arrow. I personally like this option because the Auto Show kicking in
every time I get to close to the edge tends to drive me nuts.
 Manual: No Auto Hiding or Showing. Click an arrow to hide and it stays
that way until you click again.
 Sync with opposite panel: When checked, the settings you apply to one
panel will be equally applied to the panel on the opposite side.
I find a more convenient method for showing and hiding these screen elements
is the keyboard shortcuts:
 F5: Show/hide the Module Picker.
 F6: Show/hide the Filmstrip.
 F7: Show/hide the Left Panel group.
 F8: Show/hide the Right Panel group.
 Tab: Show/hide both the Left and Right panel groups.
 Shift+Tab: Show/hide the Left, Right, Top and Bottom.
When it comes to clearing the clutter and focusing on your photos, Lightroom
has one further cool trick up its sleeve. It’s called Lights Out mode and has
three states:
 Lights On: The normal operating condition, where everything is visible.
 Lights Dim: In this mode, your selected photos remain unchanged but
the surrounding interface dims. Although dimmed, the interface is acces-
sible and functional (if you know where things are).
 Lights Out: Taking the dim view to the extreme, the entire interface is
blacked out and only your photos are visible. The ultimate way to
reduce clutter!
You can jump through each Lights Out mode by pressing the L key. You set
the amount of dimming and the color the screen dims to in the preferences (I
cover all the preference settings a little later in the chapter).
Using the secondary display view
The ultimate way to gain more screen real estate is to add another screen!
Dual monitor support is a new addition in Lightroom 2.0 and a most welcome
one at that. Lightroom’s approach to dual monitor support is the addition of

a second Lightroom window that you can move to your second monitor. The
result is that you have the same primary Lightroom window on one monitor
(this is where you access all the modules and do your work) and then your
secondary display window provides additional ways to view the photos you
are working on. (While it’s possible to enable the secondary window on a
single monitor system, it is limited in its usefulness as it competes for the
same screen real estate as the primary window.)
The secondary display window functions in the same manner with all
Lightroom modules. Here are the options available in the secondary window:
 Grid: By using the Grid option, you essentially extend the Filmstrip to
the second window so that it provides greater access to all the thumb-
nails of the current group of photos. The secondary window Grid view
functions the same as Grid view in the Library module (see Chapter 5 for
more information on Grid view).
 Loupe: Allows for viewing a single image in its entirety or zoomed in
close within the second window. Loupe has three options:
• Normal: Always displays the active photo selected in the primary
window.
• Live: Continually displays the photo under the cursor as you move
over photos in the main window.
• Locked: Allows you to choose one photo to display continuously in
the second window while you view a different photo in the primary
window.
 Compare: Allows you to compare two or more photos side by side. The
secondary window Compare view functions the same way as Compare
view in the Library module. (See Chapter 6 for more information on
Compare view.)
 Survey: Allows you to view multiple photos side by side within the sec-
ondary window. The secondary window Survey view functions the same
way as Survey view in the Library module. (See Chapter 6 for more infor-
mation on Survey view.)
 Slideshow: Only available when you have the secondary window set to
full screen (not possible on a single monitor system). This option allows
you to run the slideshow on the secondary display.
There is one other cool option related to the secondary window called Show
Second Monitor Preview. (It only works when the secondary window is in full
screen mode.) When enabled, it provides a small preview window showing
what’s being displayed in the secondary window. Huh? It’s intended for situa-
tions where you might have your secondary monitor facing away from you
and toward an audience. This way you can be showing photos to an audience
on the secondary display while you work on the primary display, and the pre-
view window lets you have a peek at what your audience is seeing.
19
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

You can enable and disable the second window by clicking its icon on the
Filmstrip, choosing Window➪Second Window➪Enable from the main menu,
or by pressing F11 (Ô+F11 on a Mac).
Getting Up and Running
I’m sure you’re chomping at the bit for the opportunity to roll up your
sleeves and start putting Lightroom through its paces. I don’t blame you!
You’re gonna love it. However, if you take the time to lay the groundwork so
that you get all your ducks in a row, you’re sure to start on the right foot
(could I cram in any more metaphors?).
Preparing for installation
Don’t think of an application installation as being a tiresome chore. Rather,
think of it is a perfect excuse to do a little hard disk housekeeping. What
better time to do tasks like the following:
 Freeing up disk space by deleting unused files, clearing caches,
moving files to another disk, and emptying the Trash
 Running an error-checking application
 Running a defragmentation application (Windows only)
The best reason to clean house before installing is that it might just prevent
problems that you’d likely blame on the new application you just installed. So
save yourself some aggravation and run those programs now while you’re
busy reading this book!
I assume you’ve confirmed that your system meets the posted minimum
requirements before you purchased Lightroom (or downloaded the trial), but
generally, it’s always in your best interest to exceed the minimum whenever
possible for best performance. Here’s what matters most:
 RAM: Maximizing the amount of installed RAM is probably going to give
you the most bang for your buck. It’s more than likely that you’ll be run-
ning other applications alongside Lightroom, so the more RAM you have
the better for everyone.
 Processor: Processing large volumes of huge files takes horsepower.
Lightroom is able to take advantage of multi-core processors, so if an
upgrade is in your future, put that under consideration. 
 Disk space: When working with digital images, you just can’t have
enough disk space. If you’re shooting raw on a 10-, 12-, 17+-megapixel
camera, you don’t want to worry about running out of storage space.
Beyond storage, you need ample free space on your startup drive so
that all your applications and your operating system have enough elbow

room to function. I like using 500 GB external drives because they are
relatively inexpensive, and easy to add and remove.
 Monitor: You might think you’re looking at your photos, but you are in
fact looking at your monitor. (I actually don’t want to think about how
many hours in a day I spend basking in its glow.) For the benefit of your
eyes and the quality of your editing, consider a monitor upgrade in your
future. The truth is, the monitors that typically come bundled with most
computers are better suited to word processing, Web browsing, and
e-mail. Your choices will be limited to LCD-type monitors (the thin flat
kind) as they just don’t make the CRT-type monitors (the big TV-like
kind) anymore. This is probably a good time to call in a friend to help
you shop if you’re not sure where to start, but here are a few things to
keep in mind:
• Price: Quality in a monitor doesn’t come cheap. At the high end,
you could look at models from Eizo and LaCie, although many
people I know are quite happy on the higher end with Dell and
Apple. The technology is improving and prices are falling. 
• Size: Bigger is usually better. Your monitor is your desk space. The
bigger your desk, the easier it is to work. 19” - 30” are pretty typical
for photo work.
• Resolution: A monitor’s resolution is expressed by how many pixels
across by how many pixels down it can display (such as 1024 x
768). The larger the number, the more pixels will be displayed,
which means the more room you have to work, but it also means
things will appear smaller. Huh? Here’s why. The actual size of the
monitor (the inches across) can’t change, right? So the only thing
that can change is the size of the pixels. The more pixels you add
in, the smaller they have to get to fit. A high-resolution monitor
might have a resolution of 1920 x 1200. You really have a lot of
screen real estate at that resolution. 1920 x 1200 on a 24” monitor
is a nice size to work with. 1920 x 1200 on a 17” monitor requires
keen eyesight or glasses.
• Graphics card: This is the part of your computer that drives the
video display. You need to have a powerful-enough graphics card
to run your monitor at its native size. You don’t want to cart home
a monitor your system can’t handle. Have all your computer’s
specifications with you when you shop and ask the salespeople
what you will need.
Installing Lightroom is straightforward, whether you download the files from
Adobe’s Web site or have a disk. You’re going to be doing the standard things,
like double-clicking the installer file, accepting the end user license agreement,
and following the on-screen prompts. You know the drill. I suggest installing in
the default location and simply following along with the installation instruc-
tions. I also highly recommend taking a few seconds to skim the Lightroom
21
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

22
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Read Me file included with the installation files. It contains all the basic need-
to-know information about installing the software. It’s a good first place to
check if you encounter any problems installing or running the application.
Configuring your settings
Lightroom’s default preference settings are very good for getting you up and
running, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t a few tweaks that could suit your
workflow a little better. You adjust the seat or mirrors in your car every now
and then, right? You’ll probably want to do the same with Lightroom. 
To see what’s what with your default settings, first open the Preferences
dialog box by choosing Edit➪Preferences (Lightroom➪Preferences on a Mac)
from the main menu or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+, (Ô+, on a Mac).
The Preferences dialog box appears on-screen in all its glory, as shown in
Figure 1-7. What you see here are global preference settings, meaning these
preferences are in effect regardless of which catalog — which Lightroom data-
base file, in other words — you have open. Although many of these prefer-
ences are self-explanatory, a few are worth digging into. I do the digging for
you in the next few sections.
Figure 1-7: The Preferences dialog box.

General preferences
The General preferences tab is kind of like the catchall drawer in the kitchen;
it’s got all the stuff that didn’t fit neatly anywhere else. 
 Language: Choose the language you want Lightroom to use for its
menus and options.
 Settings: Here you can choose to tweak two settings: whether the fancy
startup screen appears every time you fire up Lightroom and whether
Lightroom checks for software updates automatically. The fancy startup
screen? That’s a personal preference, and I leave that choice up to you.
The automatic updates stuff is a bit different. If you cast your mind back
to the first time you ran Lightroom, you’ll remember that you were
asked if you wanted Lightroom to keep track of (and automatically
install) any software updates that might come down the pike. If you at
first said, “No, thanks” but have since changed your mind, you can
enable (or disable) automatic software updates here.
Software updates aren’t minor things, nor are they uncommon. Over the
course of the life of Lightroom version 1, there were some significant
bug fixes and functionality enhancements released as updates, along
with support for newer camera models and their raw file formats. All
such fixes and enhancements were made available as software updates.
Lots of folks like the idea of having Lightroom keep track of any software
updates, but if you’d rather be in control of when your applications
phone home, then be sure to periodically choose Help➪Check from the
main menu to check for updates.
 Default catalog: I cover the use of multiple catalogs in Chapter 2, but in
most cases, setting the default catalog to your specific catalog file
ensures you always open the same catalog file no matter what.
 Completion sounds: The settings for completion sounds are pretty
straightforward and entirely personal. Audible prompts are helpful when
you start a big import or export and then busy yourself with some other
task and just want a little notice of when Lightroom has finished the
process.
 Prompts: These are the warning dialogs that pop up when you attempt
to do things like move photos or folders. Some prompts have a Don’t
Show Again option to disable them from appearing in the future, which
is great when you find the warning prompts slow you down. However,
they can help keep you out of trouble, so if you change your mind and
want to enable them again, click the Reset All Warning Dialogs button to
bring them back.
 Catalog settings: The Catalog Settings button is a holdover from version
1, but is worth mentioning. Keep in mind that Lightroom has essentially
two types of preference settings: Those that are global, meaning they
affect the operation of the program (regardless of what catalog is open),
and those that are catalog specific, which control certain aspects of how
23

each catalog functions. The catalog-specific preferences have moved 
to the Catalog Settings dialog box, which you can access by clicking the
Go to Catalog Settings button or by choosing File➪Catalog Settings
(Lightroom➪Catalog Settings on a Mac) from the main menu.

The Presets tab is shown in Figure 1-8. This is one-stop shopping for all the
settings that pertain to Lightroom’s default presets and templates, and is
broken into three sections, as follows:
 Default Develop Settings: These four check boxes control Lightroom’s
default behavior when it comes to processing photos:
• Apply Auto Tone Adjustments: This setting attempts to automati-
cally adjust the exposure, blacks, brightness, and contrast for best
results. The Lightroom team has greatly improved the Auto Tone
setting in Lightroom 2, but I wouldn’t apply it as a default until
you’ve had some time to test it on your photos to see if you like
what it does. If you find it creates a favorable starting point, you
can always come back here and enable it.
• Apply Auto Grayscale Mix When Converting to Grayscale: If you use
Lightroom to convert to grayscale, you can check this box to let
Lightroom take a stab at the best conversion settings, or leave it
unchecked and start with the Grayscale Mix sliders zeroed out.
Lightroom actually does a pretty good job, so I leave this one
checked.
• Make Defaults Specific to Camera Serial Number: If you customize
the Camera Calibration tab (see Chapter 8) you can check this box
to have the customization apply to each specific camera serial
number instead of just by camera model. You’ll likely leave this
unchecked.
• Make Defaults Specific to Camera ISO Setting: If you customize the
Camera Calibration tab (see Chapter 8) you can check this box to
have the customization apply to each specific ISO setting instead
of the same for all ISO settings. You’ll likely leave this unchecked.
 Location: By default, Lightroom stores all your presets in a central loca-
tion that’s accessible to any catalog you might have open at the time.
This makes the most sense for most Lightroom users. However, if you’d
prefer to store your presets folder within the same folder as your catalog
file, you can check this box and Lightroom will move them over. Click
the Show Lightroom Presets Folder button for quick access to your
preset files.
 Lightroom Defaults: This collection of buttons serves a single purpose,
which is to set each type of preset collection back to its default state. If
presets ever seem to go missing, come back here and click the button
that corresponds to the type of missing preset.

Figure 1-8: The Presets preferences.
The Import preferences
The Import preferences tab, shown in Figure 1-9, controls the settings
Lightroom uses when importing photos into your catalog. Here are your
choices:
 Show Import Dialog When a Memory Card is Detected: I find it very
helpful to leave this check box selected because I use Lightroom exclu-
sively for managing my digital photos, so I always want the Import
dialog box to open when I pop a card in my card reader. That said, if you
find that the dialog box is getting in your way, then by all means uncheck
this option and launch the import process manually.
 Ignore Camera-generated Folder Names When Naming Folders: I don’t
know why anyone would want to use the folder names created by their
cameras when writing files to the memory cards because such names
usually only make sense to the cameras. I recommend keeping this
option checked and relying on your own folder-naming scheme.
 Treat JPEG Files Next to Raw Files as Separate Photos: By using
Lightroom, I no longer find shooting Raw+JPG useful and I prefer having
more room on my memory cards for more raw files. (Raw+JPG just
doesn’t work for me because the way Lightroom renders your raw files
25
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

26
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
won’t always match the JPG from the camera.) However, if reasons or
habit dictate that you shoot Raw+JPG and you want to import them
both as separate files into Lightroom (so that you can work with both
versions), then check this box. Otherwise, Lightroom treats the JPEG
files as a type of sidecar file and won’t display them within Lightroom.
 Import DNG Creation: These settings pertain to the Copy Photos as
Digital Negative (DNG) and Add to Catalog Import option. The lowercase
file extension is the norm, so there’s no reason to change it. The medium
size JPEG preview is a good compromise on file size. The default conver-
sion method settings are great because they preserve the raw data and
create a smaller file using lossless compression. The big choice is if you
want to embed the original raw file or not. You would want to embed the
original raw file if you felt there may come a point in time where you
might want to extract the original raw file so that you could process it in
software that doesn’t work with DNG. The downside to embedding the
original raw file is that you double the file’s size because you will have
the converted raw data (this is what Lightroom will use) and then will
add the entire original unaltered file as well (which just sits untouched
in case some day it is needed). I prefer to leave this unchecked.
Figure 1-9: The Import preferences.

The External Editing preferences
If you have Photoshop or Photoshop Elements installed, you’ll see, as shown
in Figure 1-10, that it’s configured as your primary external editor. (In my
case, it is Photoshop CS3.) You can also configure other applications to have
additional editors. However, if you don’t have Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements installed, you’ll only be able to configure the Additional Editor
option, as the first slot is reserved exclusively for the two Adobe products. 
The purpose of this dialog box is to configure the default settings Lightroom
uses when you send a copy of a photo with Lightroom adjustments to an exter-
nal editor for additional work. Remember, Lightroom never alters your source
photos, so if you want to take all the work you have done in Lightroom and
apply it to a file so that you can continue working in a different application,
then Lightroom has to create a copy of that photo first. These are the settings
Lightroom uses to create that copy. You’ll also configure what applications (if
any) you want to use as an additional editor in this dialog box.
All external editors have the same basic file-setting options (File Format,
Color Space, Bit Depth, Resolution, and Compression) to be configured. You
do need to configure both editors independently, but this gives you the
opportunity to set up each editor differently. The options you choose are
going to be determined by your own needs and the type of editor you are
using. After giving you a closer look at the file options, I’ll go over the steps
for adding additional editors. Here are the file options:
 File Format: You have two file format options to choose from — TIFF
and PSD. Both formats support layers, 16-bit files, and available color
spaces. PSD is Photoshop’s native file format, but it’s a proprietary
format and not as widely supported outside the Adobe family of applica-
tions. In light of this, my preference is to use TIFF, but there’s no wrong
choice here.
 Color Space: You can find out more about color spaces in Chapter 3, but
in a nutshell, a color space is a way to define a range of colors so that
those colors can be accurately reproduced on different systems.
Lightroom has an internal color space that contains all the colors your
camera can capture. Any time Lightroom creates an actual rendered copy
of your source files, it converts that file from Lightroom’s internal color
space to the output color space you’ve chosen. You have three color
spaces to choose from:
• ProPhoto RGB: A 16-bit color space capable of holding all the colors
captured by your camera, ProPhoto RGB is very similar to
Lightroom’s working color space, and therefore, the recommended
setting.
• AdobeRGB (1998): An 8-bit color space without as many colors as
ProPhoto RGB, AdobeRGB (1998) is a common color space for digi-
tal photographers who are used to shooting JPG. This is your best
choice if you choose 8 bit in the Bit Depth drop-down list.
27
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

28
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
• sRGB: Also an 8-bit color space, but with fewer saturated colors
than Adobe RGB, sRGB has its place as an output color space, but
it isn’t a good choice when sending files to be edited in Photoshop.
 Bit Depth: This setting determines how much data is contained in a file.
The more bits the more information. The more information the better for
editing purposes. 16 bit is the recommended option if you’re working
with raw files. 8 bit is recommended if you’re working with JPG.
 Resolution: Ultimately, the resolution setting only comes into play when
you are printing. In this context, it simply sets the resolution tag in the
new file’s metadata so that it is there if needed. It doesn’t affect the
number of pixels in the file whatsoever. You’ll see 240 as the default set-
ting; however, if your workflow requires that files have a different resolu-
tion setting (such as 300) then you can enter that here. 
 Compression: This option is only available when TIFF is selected as the
file format. ZIP is a lossless compression format. Your choices here are
to use no compression (None) or apply compression (ZIP). Some other
applications have trouble handling compressed TIFFs, so if you want a
more compatible choice, choose None. If you want to save a bit of disk
space, then choose ZIP.
Setting up additional external editors
In Lightroom 1, you could only choose one additional editor, but that function-
ality has been expanded to allow for multiple additional editors. In a nutshell,
you choose an editor, configure its settings, and then save those settings as a
preset. You can create as many presets as you need. Here are the steps:
1. In the Additional External Editor section, click the Choose button.
2. Navigate to and select the application you want to use as an editor.
You’ll see the name of this application listed next to Application back in
the Preferences dialog box.
3. Configure all the file-setting options for the type of files you want to
send to that editor.
4. Choose Save Current Settings as New Preset from the Preset drop-
down menu.
5. Give the preset a name and click Create.
You’ll see this name listed under the Photo➪Edit in the menu so make it
descriptive of both the application and file settings.
You can repeat those steps for any additional editors or configuration of set-
tings for the same editor.
When Lightroom renders a copy to send to Photoshop, it appends a -Edit
suffix to the copy by default. You can customize this suffix in the Edit
Externally File Naming section at the bottom of the dialog box, but I’d say,
unless you have a real need to change the suffix, the default works just fine.

Figure 1-10: The External Editing preferences.
The File Handling preferences
Figure 1-11 shows the File Handling preference settings. This is another one
of those catchall collections of settings, so let me go through each section
and make some sense of what can be done here:
 Reading Metadata: It is possible to create structure or hierarchies in
your keywords (i.e., you might have a keyword “Animal” and then under
it you would nest all the types of animals in your photos). There’s no
single standard for what character must be used to separate hierarchical
keywords when they are written into a file’s metadata. Lightroom auto-
matically recognizes the | (pipe) character between two words as a
means to denote structure, but if you use other programs that use either
a . (dot) or a / (slash) as a keyword separator, then check the respective
boxes in the preferences; Lightroom respects your choice during import
as well, so that your keyword structure is maintained.
 File Name Generation: Different operating systems and even different
applications can have problems with certain characters being used
within filenames. The settings in the File Name Generation section allow
you to configure how Lightroom responds to these characters when it
encounters them in a filename. Here’s what I recommend for creating 
29
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

30
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
a consistent and bombproof approach to dealing with problematic 
filenames:
• Choose the largest set of characters to treat as illegal.
• Choose either dashes or underscores to be used as a replacement
character when an illegal character is encountered.
• Choose the same character you chose in Step 2 to be used as a
replacement for any spaces found in a filename.
 Camera Raw Cache Settings: The intended purpose of any cache is to
store (usually temporarily) frequently accessed data to speed up the
processes that require that data to function. In this case, Lightroom
shares a cache with Adobe Camera Raw, with the primary purpose of
helping Lightroom reopen files in the Develop module faster. The default
setting is a good compromise between size of the cache and benefit from
its use. If you have a drive with a lot of free space, or if you just want to
move the cache from its default location, you can click the Choose
button and select a different disk. Click the Purge Cache button to clear
it and regain space on that disk.
Figure 1-11: The File Handling preferences.

The Interface preferences
Although some of the Interface preferences, as shown in Figure 1-12, are
entirely cosmetic, there are some really useful settings here as well:
 Panels: I’ll leave the Panel End Mark (refer to Figure 1-6 to see the
default end mark) decision up to your own sense of flair, but these little
decorative icons appear at the bottom of the panel groups in each
module and for the most part you won’t notice them after awhile (you
can even turn them off). In regards to panel font size, if you’re finding
the panel text a little on the small side, you can try bumping it up a
notch. It might not be much, but it’s all you can do. Change the Panel
Font Size setting to Large and it will take effect the next time you start
Lightroom.
 Lights Out: I went over the Lights Out function a little earlier in this
chapter (press L to cycle through Lights Out modes), but here are its
configuration settings. The Dim Level controls how much the Screen
Color changes at the first level of dimming (at 80% you can just make out
the interface). The defaults work pretty well, but you can increase or
decrease the first dim level amount by changing the percentage, or
change the color used to hide the interface to different shades of gray.
 Background: The area around the photo — but inside the panels — is
called the background. The default color is medium gray because that’s
a neutral color that will have the least influence on how you perceive the
colors in your photo. You might try different colors, but I think you’ll
come back to the default. I’m not sure why there is an option to add an
overlay texture to the background, but there is one if you’d like to try it.
Perhaps you are the one person who wished there was a way to add pin-
stripes to the background?
 Filmstrip: When it comes to the Filmstrip settings, I prefer to keep all
four of these options checked. I like being able to see ratings (the
number of stars assigned), picks (the flag states you can assign), and
badges (small icons that appear if keywords, cropping, or develop set-
tings have been applied to a photo) on the thumbnails in the Filmstrip.
Additionally, the Image Info tooltips are a great way to see the filename,
capture date and time, and dimensions; just hover over an image with
your cursor.
 Tweaks: The Tweaks section is the one area of the Interface preferences
where you’ll see a slight difference between Windows and Mac. On the
Mac, you find an option to use typographic fractions, but if you wander
over to a Windows machine, you find that such fractions aren’t available.
Therefore, Mac users can have their exposure fractions expressed in a
much cuter manner. Don’t take this as an unassailable argument for
switching platforms, however. Especially because Windows users have a
tweak that Mac does not — the Use System Preference for Font Smoothing
option. What it means is that Lightroom, on Windows, applies font
smoothing (meaning it literally makes the edges of screen fonts appear
smoother and rounder) independently of the operating system. So, if you
31
Chapter 1: Introducing Lightroom

32
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
intentionally turned off font smoothing at the operating system level
(some people don’t like the smooth look) and you want Lightroom to
follow suit, then check the Use System Preference for Font Smoothing box.
Both operating systems have a setting in common, though — Zoom
Clicked Point to Center. By checking this option, you’re telling Lightroom
to zoom in and shift the point you clicked to the center of the screen. I
prefer to leave this unchecked because when I click to zoom in, I want the
point I clicked to remain under my cursor. When Zoom Clicked Point to
Center is enabled, the point you click will instead zoom and shift to the
center. Give it a test drive if you wish, but I think you’ll agree unchecked
is better.

Understanding the Role 
of the Lightroom Catalog
In This Chapter
 Understanding the catalog concept
 Caring for the Lightroom catalog
 Backing up your catalog
 Understanding the role of preview files
 Transferring data between two catalogs
A
key factor separating Lightroom from a pixel editor like Adobe
Photoshop and a file browser like Adobe Bridge is Lightroom’s use of a
catalog file. The catalog in Lightroom is essentially a database, and
as such it is simply the repository for everything Lightroom
“knows” about your photos. Luckily, you don’t need to
know much about databases to use Lightroom, but if you
understand how this particular catalog/database fits
into the big picture, you’re able to work smarter when
managing, organizing, processing, outputting, and
safeguarding your photos.
The great thing about a database (unlike my own
brain) is that it’s able to recall everything that’s
entered into it. It’s equally important to note, how-
ever, that a database knows only what’s entered into
it! To make sure the catalog remains “in the know,” you
should always use Lightroom for basic file-maintenance
tasks (such as moving, deleting, and renaming) of your
imported photos. You might use Windows Explorer, Finder, or
Bridge for this purpose, but by using Lightroom you ensure the cata-
log (database) remains up to date because Lightroom (rather than some
other application) is doing all the work. If you perform those tasks outside of
Lightroom, the database doesn’t know what happened, and as a result, will
be out of sync with your actual photos. This results in more work for you,
which is why understanding how the catalog works is so important.

34
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Catalog Basics
When you install Lightroom, it automatically creates an empty catalog file at
the default location as part of the installation process. In fact, Lightroom
can’t even function without one. You can open Microsoft Word without
having a document open, and you can open Photoshop without having an
image open, but you can’t open Lightroom without opening a catalog. It’s
integral to Lightroom’s operation! 
Knowing where the catalog is located
The default installation location for the catalog depends on the operating
system you’re using:
 Windows: My Documents\My Pictures\Lightroom
 Mac: Pictures/Lightroom
Inside the Lightroom folder, you find the catalog file, which has a .lrcat file
extension, and the file that holds all the previews of your imported images
(called the preview cache), which has a .lrdata file extension. These two
files work together to make Lightroom operational.
If you want to keep your working catalog at a different location than the
default (perhaps that default drive is low on free space, or perhaps you prefer
to keep all your photo-related files in a different location) then you could
simply move the entire Lightroom folder to a new location on your computer
and it would work just fine. 
A couple of things to keep in mind regarding where a catalog can live happily:
 Local drive: The catalog has to be kept on a local drive (external drives
are fine). Lightroom can’t access a catalog over a network. However, you
can access photos over a network.
 Free space: Make sure to place the catalog on a drive with a lot of free
space (at least 15–20 percent free). The size of your database and its
companion preview cache (more on that later) need room to grow as
you import new images and process them.
Keep in mind that if you move your catalog, you’re going to have to help
Lightroom find that catalog the first time you want to open it. Here’s how
that’s done:

1. Launch Lightroom.
If Lightroom can’t immediately locate the catalog file, it displays the
dialog box shown in Figure 2-1.
2. Click the Choose a Different
Catalog button.
Doing so opens the Select
Catalog dialog box shown in
Figure 2-2.
3. Click the Choose button.
4. In the new dialog box that
appears, navigate to the loca-
tion you chose as the new
home for your catalog, select
the .lrcat file, and then click
Choose.
You return to the Select Catalog
dialog box and the path to the
catalog you selected displays
prominently in the Catalog
Location field.
5. Click the Select button.
Lightroom launches with the catalog at this new location, and will
remember it in the future.
An alternative to rewiring Lightroom’s institutional memory, as outlined
above, is to create a new catalog at the location of your choice and then go
back and delete the old catalog. Here are the steps to create a new catalog:
1. Launch Lightroom.
This will open the soon-to-be-deleted catalog, but don’t worry; you’ll
take care of it later. 
2. Choose File➪New Catalog from the main menu.
Doing so launches the Create Folder with New Catalog dialog box.
3. Navigate to the location on your hard drive where you want to create
the catalog.
4. Enter a name in the File Name field and then click Save (Create on 
a Mac).
Lightroom closes and relaunches with the new empty catalog.
After you are happily using the new catalog, you can safely go back and
delete the Lightroom catalog folder at the default location.

Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Choosing which catalog to open
Lightroom stores the location of the catalogs you use in its Preferences file.
You can configure what catalog to open when Lightroom launches by going to
Edit➪Preferences (Lightroom➪Preferences on a Mac) and clicking the General
tab shown in Figure 2-3. Clicking the Default Catalog drop-down menu reveals
the following choices:
Figure 2-3: The Default Catalog preference setting.
 Load Most Recent Catalog: This is the default. Lightroom simply opens
the last catalog that was used.
 Prompt Me When Starting Lightroom: The Select Catalog dialog box
(refer to Figure 2-2) appears when Lightroom is launched. From here you
can choose to open any catalog or even create a new one.
 A specific catalog: You can configure a specific catalog to always open
when Lightroom is launched.
I recommend setting it to use a specific catalog when starting up so that
Lightroom always opens the same catalog every time you open it — even if
you only have one catalog now. This will make your life simpler down the 

road because you will know that opening Lightroom always means opening
that specific catalog. It’s easy enough to switch to another catalog using the
FileÍOpen Catalog or FileÍOpen Recent menu if you need to. In fact, you can
even force the Select Catalog dialog box to open by holding the Ctrl key
(Option key on a Mac) and launching Lightroom.
Caring for the Catalog
You initially enter information about your photos into the catalog with the help
of Lightroom’s Import function. As each photo is “imported,” Lightroom writes
its metadata and its location on your hard drive into the catalog. While you con-
tinue to work in Lightroom, everything you do with your photos is automatically
saved in the catalog in real time (there is no “Save” menu in Lightroom). When I
say everything, I mean everything — from keywords and ratings to exposure
adjustments to collection membership and virtual copies. Everything.
Because of this design feature, Lightroom is referred to as a metadata editor,
meaning that you never edit the pixels in your source images. All the adjust-
ments you perform in Lightroom are stored as a set of metadata instructions —
in the catalog, of course — that Lightroom uses to render its internal preview
files and to create copies of your original files during output. People who shoot
raw might be more familiar with this concept, but it’s a huge paradigm shift for
those who shoot JPG, or who are used to editing JPG, TIF, and PSD files in an
image editor like Photoshop. Take a moment to let that sink in because it will
make your life much easier moving forward. In light of this, it’s vitally impor-
tant that the catalog is well cared for and protected.
Lightroom has a catalog control panel (of sorts) that displays important
information and provides tools for its care. It’s called the Catalog Settings
dialog box, and you can see it in Figure 2-4. Choosing Edit➪Catalog Settings
(Lightroom➪Catalog Settings on a Mac) from the main menu gets you there.
The General tab allows you to control the following:
 Information: Displays the catalog’s location, name, creation date, last
backup date, last optimized date, and file size. Click the Show button to
open the folder containing the catalog in Windows Explorer (Finder on 
a Mac). 
 Backup: Configures the frequency in which the catalog backup function
is run.
 Optimize: Clicking the Relaunch and Optimize button performs a little
database housekeeping on the catalog to reduce its size and improve
performance.
Backing up and optimization are important enough topics to warrant their
own sections, so I do the smart thing and provide them . . . now.
37
Chapter 2: Understanding the Role of the Lightroom Catalog

38
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Figure 2-4: The Catalog Settings dialog box with the General tab active.
Backing up your catalog
It’s important to note that Lightroom’s backup function does not back up
your photos (they’re never actually inside Lightroom), but it can help protect
you against data loss by automating the process of creating backup copies
of your catalog. A full system backup procedure outside of Lightroom is still
required to protect all your data (including your photos). An important note
regarding backups for Mac users, Adobe recommends that you do not run
Time Machine’s backup or restore functions while Lightroom is open.
When the Catalog Backup function runs, it creates a fully operational and
identical copy of your working catalog file. Should you ever have a problem
with your working catalog (file corruption or data loss) you need to swap the
bad .lrcat file with the latest backup .lrcat file. The next time you launch
Lightroom, it’s in the exact state it was in at the time the backup was created.
I also want to point out that Lightroom does not back up the preview cache in
this process, and I suggest that you exclude it from your system backup strat-
egy as well because the cache file will grow quite large as you continue to
import new photos (we’re talking gigabytes of space here). If you ever “lose”
your preview cache, Lightroom automatically creates a new one for you.

Thankfully you can automate the catalog backup process so that you don’t
have to think about it. In the Catalog Settings dialog box, click the Back Up
Catalog drop-down menu to see your scheduling choices, which range from
Never to Every Time Lightroom Starts, as shown in Figure 2-5. The first thing
you might notice is that the backup can run only when Lightroom starts. If
you want to force a backup after a good day’s work, set the backup to run
Every Time Lightroom Starts; then close and restart Lightroom when you
finish working to trigger the backup.
Figure 2-5: The Back Up Catalog drop-down menu.
When considering the frequency with which to schedule a backup, just imag-
ine what would happen if your catalog went kablooey. You’d want your backup
catalog to be as fresh as possible, right? Setting it to run once per day is a safe
choice. I personally have mine set to Every Time Lightroom Starts. It might
seem like overkill, but the backup dialog you get on startup is equipped with a
Skip button. The result is that I get a constant reminder to back up every time
I open Lightroom and the option to skip if I haven’t done much work since the
last time I backed up. It also makes it easy to force a backup by simply closing
and restarting Lightroom after a big work session.
39
Chapter 2: Understanding the Role of the Lightroom Catalog

40
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
The next time you start Lightroom in the period for the backup function to
run, you’re greeted with the Back Up Catalog dialog box shown in Figure 2-6.
Here’s how you handle this puppy:
1. Specify where you want the
backup catalog saved by click-
ing the Choose button and then
navigating to your desired
location. 
I suggest having your backup
saved to a different drive than
where your working catalog is
located. The reason is that if
you lose the drive containing your working catalog, you’ll be very glad
that you had a recent backup safely tucked away on a different drive.
2. Check the Test Integrity of This Catalog box to have the backup
process check for corruption in the database. 
I know it adds a little time to the backup process, but it’s time well
spent.
3. Click the Backup button to begin the process. 
If you change your mind and just want Lightroom to open, click the Skip
Now button to bypass the backup function. Click Exit if you want to
cancel the backup and prevent Lightroom from opening.
Each backup function creates a new copy without touching the existing
backup files. It’s up to you to manage the backup files so that they don’t fill
the destination hard drive. If you run your backups regularly without clearing
the old ones, you might just have several gigs of hard drive space waiting to
be recovered! I periodically delete all but the most recent two or three
backup copies.
Optimizing your catalog
In the Optimize section of the General tab on the Catalog Settings dialog box
(refer to Figure 2-4) you find the Relaunch and Optimize button. If you have a
large catalog and notice that it seems a little sluggish, a Relaunch and Optimze
operation might give you a performance boost. The whole idea behind
Relaunch and Optimize is that it reorganizes the data in the catalog and
removes unused space. The end result can be a smaller and faster catalog file.
One click of the Relaunch and Optimize button closes Lightroom, runs the
housekeeping functions on the catalog, and then displays a confirmation
dialog that it has finished. All you have to do is click the OK button to
relaunch Lightroom.
Figure 2-6: The Back Up Catalog dialog box.

While the whole Relaunch and Optimize process was originally put in place 
by Lightroom’s designers to speed up slow-pokey catalogs, I’ve seen circum-
stances where a Relaunch and Optimize has corrected problems ranging from
catalog exports to identity plates, so I regularly include this as a troubleshoot-
ing step for people with strange catalog behaviors.
Managing the Preview cache
When you’re making your way through the Catalog Settings dialog box, you
notice the File Handling tab to the immediate right of the General tab. The
File Handling tab (shown in Figure 2-7) has three settings to help you manage
the size and quality of the preview files that Lightroom creates for all your
imported photos.
Before I get into what those controls do, I’d like to talk about what previews
are and what they do. I recently was asked a great question by a new
Lightroom user who was trying to understand how Lightroom works. She
said, “If my source images are never altered and never in Lightroom, then
what am I looking at when I’m working in Lightroom?” What a great question!
The answer, of course, is preview files. You encounter three types of preview
files in Lightroom:
 Embedded thumbnails: These are the previews created by your camera
and embedded in the raw file. You see these previews before Lightroom
renders its version. The quality and size of these previews vary by
camera make and model.
 Standard: These are what you see in all the modules except Develop.
The size and quality of these previews are determined by the settings
you choose on the File Handling tab.
 1:1: These previews match the pixel dimensions of your source files.
These are used when you view images at 1:1 view in the Library.
Therefore, no matter where you work in Lightroom, you’re looking at a copy
of your source image. While you make adjustments, Lightroom re-renders
previews on the fly to show you the effect of the adjustments. All these pre-
views are stored in the Preview cache alongside the Catalog file. Because
Lightroom renders the previews as needed, they’re not essential files and are
not included in the backup process. However, because they’re rendered for
every photo you import, they require a significant chunk of disk space over
time. This brings the discussion back to the File Handling tab of the Catalog
Settings dialog box (refer to Figure 2-7).

Figure 2-7: The File Handling tab of the Catalog Settings dialog box.
You can tweak your Preview Cache settings in three ways:
 Standard Preview Size: Use this drop-down menu to choose a pixel size
that best matches the resolution of your monitor. Lightroom uses stan-
dard-sized previews when you view the image at Fit Screen, meaning you
see the entire image on-screen. Because of this, you don’t need to gener-
ate a standard-sized preview that is greater than the resolution of your
monitor. The default 1440 pixels is a good compromise between pixel
dimensions and file size.
 Preview Quality: This drop-down menu allows you to determine the
amount of JPG compression applied to the standard-sized previews. The
default setting of Medium is a good compromise between quality and file
size. 
 Automatically Discard 1:1 Previews: Use this drop-down menu to con-
figure how long Lightroom keeps the 1:1 previews in the cache. Because
they’re high-quality, pixel-for-pixel copies of your source files, such 

preview files can be quite large, so you might not want them lying about
on your hard drive for too long. Lightroom, of course, re-renders them if
they’re needed after having been discarded, but then you have to wait
for the render to complete. Leaving the setting to 30 days is a good bal-
ance between performance and keeping a damper on the growing size of
the cache.
You can force Lightroom to delete 1:1 previews at any time by going to
Library➪Previews➪Discard 1:1 Previews. Therefore, you’re not entirely
dependent upon that setting if you find your Preview cache is taking over
your hard drive.
“But wait, Rob, what’s this Import Sequence Numbers section doing at the
bottom of the File Handling tab?” you might ask. Okay, this section’s inclusion
here might be Lightroom’s version of a non sequitur — at least in the context
of talking about previews. However, because it is here and you’re obviously
looking at it — and no doubt wondering what it’s all about — I tell you:
 Import Number: This is where Lightroom tracks the number of imports
for use in filename templates when renaming files during import. It only
increments when that particular filename token is being used to rename
files. You can change the number prior to importing to set it at a differ-
ent value.
 Photos Imported: This is where Lightroom tracks the number of photos
for use in filename templates when renaming files during import. It only
increments when that particular filename token is being used to rename
files. You can change the number prior to importing to set it at a differ-
ent value. The main use of this value is for when you want to number
files incrementally across multiple imports.
I guess they had to put those two guys somewhere. Just keep them in mind
when I discuss file naming in Chapter 4.
Metadata options
The Metadata tab, shown in Figure 2-8, doesn’t help you care for your catalog
file, but it does have the potential to affect how you work. As for what
Metadata actually is, think of it as data about the data about your photos. It
includes the data that comes from your camera (called “EXIF” data), the data
you enter (such as copyright, location, keywords, etc.), and all the settings for
the adjustments you make when developing your photos — otherwise known
as Develop settings). This metadata is stored in the catalog file, which is why
this panel is here. Take a look at the options to see what I mean:
43
Chapter 2: Understanding the Role of the Lightroom Catalog

44
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Figure 2-8: The Metadata tab on the Catalog Settings dialog box.
 Offer Suggestions from Recently Entered Values: While you enter vari-
ous metadata (that is, keywords), Lightroom tries to help you by offering
auto-complete suggestions after you type a few characters that resemble
a previous entry. Uncheck the box to turn off this feature. Click the Clear
All Suggestions Lists button if you want to keep the feature enabled but
want to reset it.
 Include Develop Settings in Metadata inside JPEG, TIFF, and PSD
Files: Leave this box checked if you want to include the Develop settings
(and adjustments you made in the Develop module) with all other meta-
data when you write to each file’s metadata. If unchecked, the Develop
settings reside only in the catalog file. The benefit of writing Develop set-
tings to the file itself is that if that file were imported into another
Lightroom catalog, the settings would carry over. In addition, Adobe
Camera Raw 4 (and up) can read the settings in JPG and TIF files, which
would allow you to open those files in Camera Raw and see those adjust-
ments. Develop settings are always written to raw files.
 Automatically Write Changes into XMP: When this box is checked,
Lightroom writes to each file’s XMP metadata space automatically, and
keeps it in sync with the catalog file. (XMP is short for Adobe’s
Extensible Metadata Platform, which simply defines how the data is
stored in the file.) However, certain things cannot be written to XMP,

such as collection memberships, virtual copies, and stacking and
develop histories. The benefit of writing to XMP is that you not only
keep key metadata and settings embedded in the source files, but the
information is accessible to programs outside of Lightroom (Adobe
Bridge and Camera Raw, for example). The downside is that the auto-
matic process can include a performance hit (on slower systems)
because Lightroom works behind the scenes to write to each file.
 Write Date or Time Changes into Proprietary Raw Files: This setting
only comes into play if you make a change to the capture date/time of a
raw file. If the box is checked, then Lightroom will change the capture
date/time inside the actual raw file. Some people prefer to keep their raw
files completely unaltered, so if the box is unchecked (the default state)
then Lightroom will only write the change to the associated XMP file,
leaving the source raw file unchanged.
If you’re noticing a drag on performance with the Automatically Write
Changes into XMP option enabled, you can disable it and then manually tell
Lightroom to write to each file’s XMP metadata by selecting the file(s) and
pressing Ctrl+S (Ô+S on a Mac). The result is the same, but you get to control
when it occurs. The downside is that it’s up to you to remember.
Working with Multiple Catalogs
I often get asked about the circumstances under which it makes sense to
employ a multiple catalog approach to working with Lightroom. There’s no
absolute right answer, but if you understand the limitations of catalogs, then
you can make the best decision for your circumstances.
The single most important factor when considering the use of multiple cata-
logs is that Lightroom cannot search across multiple catalogs. From a manage-
ment perspective, if you want to access all your photos, it’s far simpler to
have them in a single catalog, which allows you to leverage all the power of
Lightroom’s database to find, gather, and work with your photos. It’s terribly
inefficient to develop a manual (human) system for managing your catalogs
just so you know which catalog is responsible for which photos. Yikes!
That said, if you have unique circumstances where groups of photos are so
discrete that you might want or need to keep them separate from each other
(for example, having a separate catalog for each client or job), then a multi-
catalog approach might make more sense. You still need a system for manag-
ing all these catalogs so that you can get your hands on the right image when
you need it, though.
Some people are concerned about the size of a single catalog as a limiting
factor, seeing that as a reason to have many smaller catalogs. There’s no limit
on the number of photos that can be imported into a catalog. Your system
components are a bigger limiting effect on performance when working with
45
Chapter 2: Understanding the Role of the Lightroom Catalog

46
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
large catalogs. Generally, maximizing your RAM, maintaining ample free space
on your startup disk, and using fast multi-core processors all improve the
performance of working with very large catalogs. I do know of many people
working happily with catalogs in excess of 100,000 photos.
I can imagine one scenario, though, where multiple catalogs might make
sense: when you’re working with a laptop on the road and away from your
desktop (and master catalog). Because this set of circumstances is probably
common, I think it makes sense to look at what’s involved in keeping two cat-
alogs in sync.
Transferring data between catalogs
Okay, in this scenario you have a desktop computer and it contains your
master catalog. You do most of your image processing and printing from this
workstation. The catalog on this computer is the hub through which all your
work passes through. However, as the saying goes, you can’t take it with you,
so you also have a laptop for working offsite (or while watching TV).
Pretend you’re leaving for a week of shooting at some exotic location (hey,
you’re imagining, so you might as well enjoy it). You need to be able to
import and process the photos on your laptop while on location and then get
all that work into your master catalog upon your return. Our imaginary
Lightroom user (that is, you) is now faced with the following:
 Importing and processing new photos into the laptop while on the
road.
 Getting all the work from the laptop to the desktop (and master 
catalog) upon returning.
Is this possible? Yes, by using Lightroom’s catalog Export and Import func-
tion. The next two sections give you the blow-by-blow.
You can install Lightroom on your laptop and your desktop. You can legally
install Lightroom on two computers as long as you don’t run Lightroom on
them both simultaneously. So, by installing Lightroom on the laptop you will
automatically create a catalog file to go with it. I use the catalog on my laptop
as a temporary working catalog while in the field.
Exporting a catalog
Okay, you’ve returned from the trip with a laptop full of photos and the
laptop’s catalog full of data. The first part of your (imaginary) process is to
get these photos and the catalog data from the laptop to the desktop. Here
are the steps:

1. Open Lightroom on the laptop.
This opens your temporary working catalog from the trip.
2. Expand the Catalog panel in the Library module and click All
Photographs.
For this example, you’ll want to export all the photos in the laptop cata-
log, and this is the easiest way to gather them up. You’ll see the thumb-
nails of all imported photos display in the content area.
3. Choose File➪Export as Catalog from the main menu.
Doing so launches the Export as Catalog dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 2-9.
Figure 2-9: The Export as Catalog dialog box.
4. Choose the location where you want the exported catalog and photos
to be saved. 
The goal is to get the data from the laptop to the desktop. High-speed
external drives are great for data transfers of this size. You can export
across a network, but a high-speed external drive may be faster if you’re
47
Chapter 2: Understanding the Role of the Lightroom Catalog

48
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
moving a lot of data. I like using external drives so I can do the export
before I get home and then simply connect the external drive to the
desktop for transfer. The choice is yours. 
5. Enter a name in the File Name field.
6. Leave Save as Type on the default setting.
7. Leave the three check boxes at the bottom on the default setting.
Figure 2-9 shows I am exporting a catalog with 866 photos (which is the
entire catalog). By clicking All Photographs in Step 2, I told Lightroom I
wanted to export everything, so I don’t want to check Export Selected
Photos Only (or else only the actively selected photos will be included).
The Export Negative Files option means that Lightroom will include a
copy of every imported photo along with the exported catalog. (This is
how we move the photos from the laptop to the desktop.) Including
available previews is not required, but it will enable you to see the
thumbnails later when you import this catalog into the master catalog.
8. Click the Save button.
Your export begins. 
When the progress meter is complete, a copy of your catalog has migrated to
the new location you chose. It’s a fully functional catalog containing all the
data the master catalog has on those exported photos. Look in the exported
folder, and you see the folders containing the photos alongside the catalog
file.
Phase 1 is done. Time to connect that catalog to the one on your desktop.
Importing from a catalog
Now that you have a folder containing your exported catalog as well as copies
of your photos, you need to make it accessible to the desktop computer. In my
example, I used an external drive that I moved from the laptop to the desktop.
Here are the steps to import from a catalog:
1. Connect the external drive to the desktop.
2. Open Lightroom on the desktop. 
This opens your master catalog.
3. Choose File➪Import from Catalog.
The Import from Lightroom Catalog dialog box makes an appearance, as
shown in Figure 2-10.

Figure 2-10: The Import from Lightroom Catalog dialog box.
4. Navigate to the exported .lrcat file on the external drive, select it,
and then click Open.
Doing so launches the Import from Catalog dialog box shown in Figure
2-11; a subtle difference in name from the dialog box in Step 3, but very
different functionality. Note: The name of the .lrcat file you’re import-
ing from is shown on the Title bar of the dialog box.
If your photos aren’t visible in the Preview section, select the Show
Preview check box.
5. Choose the Copy New Photos to a New Location and Import option
from the File Handling drop-down menu.
The goal is to copy files from the external drive to the internal drive and
store them with all your other photos.
6. For the Copy To field, click the Choose button and navigate to a
folder on the desktop drive where the photos can be saved and then
click OK.
The selected location is entered into the Copy To field.
7. Click the Import button.
The import process kicks off. The data from the .lrcat file on the
external drive is copied into the .lrcat file on the desktop. The photos
are copied from the external drive to the desktop as well.

Figure 2-11: The Import from Catalog dialog box.
When your hard drive stops spinning, you’ve successfully transferred a group
of photos (and all the work that has been done to them) from the laptop to
the desktop. (Time to congratulate yourself.)
By using Lightroom to perform the data handoff you ensure that Lightroom
never loses track of the source photos and that all your work makes it back
home. Enjoy!

ightroom is intended as “the professional photographer’s essential tool-
box,” therefore, Adobe assumes its users are already fluent with a certain
level of digitalphoto-ese. Although that’s certainly true for many users, it’s been
my experience (through helping many professional photographers with this
application) that a person can be quite skilled in the art of photography with-
out knowing a bit from a byte or an NEF from a CR2 or a DNG. I can
tell you quite confidently that your experience with Lightroom
improves significantly when you increase your working
knowledge of a few fundamental digital photography con-
cepts that are integral to Lightroom’s operation.
Some of these concepts are complex and involve
new words and mind-numbing calculations (done by
the computer not you), and some subjects have
entire books devoted to just that topic alone. I’m
not going to get that in-depth. What I want to do is
introduce you to these fundamentals and explain
how they affect your Lightroom experience.
Getting Familiar with File Formats
Digital cameras aren’t just light-capturing devices, but image-processing
computers as well (they even have a tiny built-in LCD screen). The act of click-
ing the shutter release does expose the sensor to light through the lens, but
after that the camera’s internal computer takes over and creates a digital file.
Your camera settings determine what type of file is created and, depending on
the file type, the image processing that happens to that file after it’s captured.
If you’re scanning slides, negatives, or prints, you’re using a different capture

52
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
device (the scanner) to create a digital file. In the end, this digital file can
move through Lightroom to any number of output destinations.
The file format choice you make has an impact on the amount of information
contained in the file, the number and range of colors in the file, and its file
size. The next section shows you your Lightroom choices and gives you the
information you need to make the right choice for any given circumstance.
Which formats work with Lightroom
Lightroom is a tool designed specifically for digital photography and as such
supports only four image formats:
 JPEG: The most common file format available on all digital cameras
is JPEG (or JPG), which stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group. The
JPEG format is so popular because you can open it in just about any appli-
cation, and it can be saved at a range of file sizes. It achieves these various
file sizes by compressing the original data contained in the file. The
upside of this is that the more you compress an image, the smaller your
file size becomes, the more pictures your memory card holds, and your
camera can write the data to the card faster. The downside here is that the
type of compression employed by the JPEG format is lossy, which makes
files smaller by removing some of the original data. Too much compres-
sion results in too much data loss, which results in a degraded image.
If you shoot JPEG, use the highest-quality setting and buy larger memory
cards. JPEG files are limited to 8 bit per channel (more on that later).
 Raw: This (rather unappetizing sounding) file format is available on an
increasing number of digital cameras. In fact, any camera falling into the
Digital Single Lens Reflex (or DSLR) category has a raw format option, as
do some point and shoot models. The upside of shooting raw is that the
image file contains all the data that the camera is capable of capturing,
and it’s saved without being processed by the camera. The downside is
that the resulting image has to be processed by software on your com-
puter (hello, Lightroom!) before it’s ready for prime time. Raw files come
in many different flavors (NEF, CR2, RAF, DNG to name a few) based on
the manufacturer and camera model. 
 TIFF: While TIFF (or TIF), which stands for Tagged Image File Format, is
occasionally found as an option on some camera models, I don’t recom-
mend using it, as the highest-quality JPG setting is almost as good but
with a smaller file size. However, TIFF is a widely supported and versatile
file format that provides either 8 or 16 bit per channel and supports all
of Photoshop’s features (layers, smart objects, and so on). TIFF can also
apply a form of lossless compression (no data is lost) and is a great
choice for using when scanning or for saving out processed raw files
that will be edited further in Photoshop or other image editors.
 PSD: This is Photoshop’s native file format (as in PSD, a Photoshop
Document). Although it obviously supports all of Photoshop’s features,

it’s a proprietary format, so applications outside the Adobe family might
not work with PSD files. Like TIFF, PSD files can be 8 or 16 bit per chan-
nel and are not lossy — they don’t lose information like JPG files. PSD is
a great format when you’re exclusively working within the Adobe
Creative Suite of products.
JPEG, raw, TIFF, and PSD files are the only files Lightroom can import and
export. That means Lightroom ignores any PNGs, BMPs, GIFs, or any other
image format. That said, PNG format can be used when creating graphical
identity plates, but that’s for another chapter.
Making sense of bit depth
Numbers and math are part of any discussion of digital data; numbers are all
that computers understand after all. You don’t need to understand every-
thing that computers are doing with those numbers, but a basic conceptual
framework of what’s involved can help inform the decisions you make in your
workflow. In the previous section on file formats, I talk about how certain file
formats can be 8 or 16 bit per channel. I didn’t really explain the bit stuff in
detail there, so I’m going to make up for that right now.
At its core, bit depth translates into how much data is used to describe a single
color (and what could be more important than that?). Further, when it comes
to color and Lightroom, you’re only dealing with the RGB color model, which
means that each color in an image is derived from a combination of three
colors (called channels) — red, green, and blue. An integral concept to remem-
ber is that color is created only during output — when a color is displayed on
your monitor or when ink hits paper. Cameras don’t capture in color, but rather
they capture various levels of grayscale data in the red, green, and blue chan-
nels. Computers combine the grayscale data from each channel to display the
color you see on your monitor. The more grayscale data used to describe each
red, green, and blue channel, the more colors it can create.
Okay, so if the color of every pixel is determined by the combination of data
stored in each color channel, and you can’t change the number of channels,
the only variable you can control is the amount of data contained in each
channel (the bit depth).
A bit is just a single unit of data, and in the digital realm, it has one of two
possible values, either 0 or 1, which you can think of as either black or white.
A single bit doesn’t give much data to describe color, so how about using two
bits instead. If one bit allows for either 0 or 1, then two bits allows for addi-
tional combinations:
00
01
10
11
53
Chapter 3: Digital Photo Basics

54
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Doubling the number of bits (2x2) gives you four possibilities. This translates
into white, black, and two shades of gray in between. That still isn’t a lot of
options to describe all the colors you want to capture, so how about jumping
to 8 bits per channel. Now you have 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 possible combinations,
which translates into 256 possible shades of gray for each channel (with
white and black still being two of those possibilities). In an RGB image, that
means 256 levels of gray for each red, each green, and each blue channel.
When the three channels are combined, it allows for the creation of more
than 16 million colors (256x256x256).
Those who are used to creating digital images with a scanner also refer to an
8 bit per channel RGB image as a “24-bit” image. Although this can be a cause
for confusion, all it means is that there are three 8-bit channels (3x8 is 24). In
regard to file formats, JPEG, TIF, and PSD can be saved as 8 bit per channel
files. The important distinction to make is that because of its design, a JPG
can only be saved as an 8 bit per channel image. It just isn’t possible to have
a 16 bit per channel JPEG.
Cameras (and some scanners) can capture more than 8 bit per channel. In
fact, if you are shooting raw it’s more likely that your camera is capturing 12
bit per channel. If 8 bit per channel meant you had 256 shades of gray, then
12 bit per channel (2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2) means you have 4,096 shades
of gray per channel. Clearly that’s a lot more data to work with! So, if the
camera is capturing that much data per channel and you want to retain all of
that data for processing and editing, your only option is to shoot in raw
format because the JPG format is limited to 8 bit per channel. You can also
find higher-end DSLRs on the market that can capture in 14 bit per channel.
I hope you are still with me because all this number talk can get confusing.
Keep in mind that 8 bits equals one byte. Data is only stored in full bytes, so
this is why you only see the option to save files as either 8 or 16 bit per chan-
nel. Any file that has more than 8 bits of data is encoded in a 16-bit space.
Think of 16 bit as simply a bigger container to hold data. When you have
more data than will fit in an 8-bit container (i.e. 10, 12, 14 bit) it has to be put
in the next size up, which is 16. Make sense?
Although more data probably sounds better than less data, keep in mind
some practical implications here. More data means larger file sizes. Larger
file sizes means fewer photos stored on a given memory card, and it means
the camera takes longer to write larger files to the memory card. It also fol-
lows that it will take more time to transfer those files from your memory card
to your computer, and it will require more hard disk space to store these
larger files.
You now see why this information is so critical to the decision you make
when you choose what file type to shoot with. Every choice involves a com-
promise, and it’s up to you to decide what best suits your needs.

What is a color space?
In the previous section, I mention that Lightroom deals only with the RGB
color model, and I show that the number of gray levels that can be expressed
by each channel determines the number of possible colors that can be repre-
sented. All great info, but none of it tells what actual color any combination of
red, green, and blue will represent. To do that, the computer needs to know
what color space is being represented. A color space defines the range of
colors (called its gamut) an image can contain within a given color model (in
this case, RGB) and assigns each color within that range a specific numeric
value. You encounter the following color spaces in your camera settings or
your image-processing software when you deal with digital photos:
 sRGB: Contains the narrowest range, or gamut, of colors between these
three color spaces. However, this narrow gamut is closest to the range of
colors that most display devices are capable of reproducing. sRGB is also
the color space best suited for photos being viewed on the Web, which
means this is most commonly used for JPG files (which are always 8 bit).
 Adobe RGB (1998): Although it possesses the same number of colors as
sRGB, Adobe RGB (1998) covers a wider gamut (meaning it has more
colors at the more-saturated end of the visual spectrum than sRGB has).
This color space was created to match the wider gamut of the offset
press better. Adobe RGB (1998) is a more common choice for use with 8
bit per channel file formats going to print because it contains more of
these more-saturated colors than sRGB.
 ProPhoto RGB: Primarily used with 16 bit per channel file formats, the
ProPhoto RGB color space contains more colors (more shades of gray
per channel) than 8 bit per channel files, and it has a significantly wider
gamut than either Adobe RGB or sRGB. Wide enough to contain all the
colors your camera can capture.
These are considered device-independent color spaces, which means they’re
mathematical models whose values remain the same on all display devices.
The consistency of values within a device-independent color space is critical
because this is what the image-editing software uses to accurately translate
and display the colors on your screen. This is different from device-dependent
color spaces that exactly describe the range of colors a given device can dis-
play. (I talk about how device-dependent color spaces are created and used
in the upcoming “Importance of a Color-Managed Workflow” section.)
Okay, so what does all this stuff about color spaces mean in relation to
Lightroom? Good question. Primarily, decisions about which color space to
use are going to affect your decision-making process when configuring your
camera settings. The first decision is between JPG and raw. If you choose
JPG, then you’re choosing an 8 bit per channel output, and it means you’re
choosing either Adobe RGB or sRGB to define the range of colors in your
photos. When your camera produces a JPG file in your chosen color space,
55
Chapter 3: Digital Photo Basics

56
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
that information is embedded in the file so that image-editing applications
know what color space the RGB values in the file correspond to.
If you decide to shoot raw, then you’re choosing to hold all your captured
data and to postpone your color space decision until you process the photo
in Lightroom (or any other raw processing application).
The pros and cons of shooting raw
I hope that you’re starting to see how your decision to shoot in either JPG or
raw affects all aspects of your workflow. Time to see how JPG and raw com-
pare when push comes to shove:
 JPEG: Limited to 8 bit per channel output and either sRGB or Adobe RGB
color spaces. Results in smaller file sizes, which means faster write times
and more bang for your buck on any given memory card because —
simply put — you can cram in a lot more photos. Photo output in JPG can
still look fantastic both on-screen and in print, and JPEGs are processed
in-camera so the output is already in a universally supported format right
off the memory card.
 Raw: Contains all the data your camera can capture. Results in larger file
sizes, which means slower write times and a lower “photo population
density” on your memory card because each file takes up so much more
room. Raw provides the freedom to decide the color space based on the
specific output destination, as well as the freedom to choose the best
white balance setting for the lighting in the scene. More data per chan-
nel provides greater editing headroom during processing and adjusting,
and it’s possible to recover more detail in highlights and shadows than
with JPEG. Images need to be processed before output is possible.
Raw refers to the fact that the data hasn’t yet been processed, but raw isn’t a
file format like JPG or TIF. (You might have noticed I’m not capitalizing raw
here, which is a sure sign that it’s not some official term for a file format.)
There is no single raw file format. Instead, arrays of raw formats are propri-
etary to each camera manufacturer. For example, if you shoot Nikon, then
you might recognize the NEF format. If you shoot Canon, then you might be
familiar with CR2 or CRW. Fuji has RAF and Minolta has MRW. While Adobe
keeps Lightroom and Camera Raw (the raw plug-in for Photoshop) updated
to support these raw formats (as well as new ones that emerge with new
camera models), each camera manufacturer also produces their own raw
processing software. 
I mention the camera manufacturer software because you should be aware of
one advantage they have over Lightroom — Lightroom can’t read any of the
in-camera style settings (mostly to do with saturation and contrast adjust-
ments) you might set on your camera. The camera manufacturers consider

that information to be proprietary, but of course their own raw-processing
software can use those in-camera settings. For this reason some people like
to be able to use that software, too. Unfortunately, the settings from one
application won’t work in any other, so you just need to keep that in mind.
In a forward-thinking effort to protect against proprietary formats becoming
obsolete, Adobe developed an open raw format called DNG (or Digital
Negative). Lightroom has the ability to convert your proprietary raw files into
DNG (Adobe also has a free stand-alone DNG converter). The upside is that
your raw data can be preserved in a non-proprietary format. The downside is
that most proprietary raw processors don’t support DNG — you can use DNG
to move a proprietary raw file to Lightroom, but then you can’t get your DNG
file back into your manufacturer’s raw processor.
Every decision reflects the set of compromises you’re comfortable in making.
There really isn’t a universally right or wrong answer, only an answer that’s
best for you. To drive that point home, I’m going to tell you why I made the
switch to shooting raw and why I feel it’s a good fit with Lightroom.
When you shoot JPG, you’re handing the processing of the captured data to
your in-camera computer. This in-camera computer is bound by the settings
you dialed in and applies those same settings to every image that passes
through. Don’t get me wrong, these cameras can do a heck of job! However,
with an application like Lightroom, I finally feel like I have a tool that does just
as good of a job and allows me greater creative freedom along the way. I like
knowing that I’m working with all the data my camera can capture, and that I
can archive that data as a digital negative. I know that computers are getting
faster, software is getting better, and storage is getting cheaper. So, when I take
into account all that, I don’t mind giving the in-camera image processor the
day off, and with Lightroom, I really enjoy being in the driver’s seat.
Now, you might be saying, “Wait, Lightroom can work with JPG files too!” Yes,
this is true, but the important point is that a JPG is a processed file. It’s
already been converted to a specific color space and already has a specific
white balance value “cooked” into the pixels when it was rendered. (White
balance values determine the color of the light in the scene.) All the adjust-
ments you make to a JPG in Lightroom (or Photoshop for that matter) are rel-
ative adjustments to those cooked-in values.
The Importance of a Color-Managed Workflow
When you capture a scene with your camera, you want to reproduce the
scene’s colors as closely as possible in your output medium. For predictable
color reproduction to be possible — as you move from capture device to com-
puter to output device — you need to manage the color each step of the way.

Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Your monitor and your printer are both output devices. Thinking of a printer
as an output device may not be so surprising, because it actually produces
something that comes out of it, but the image you see on your monitor is just
as much an output. Attach a projector to your computer and there’s another
output. Add a second monitor and there’s another output. Okay, that’s fine,
but what does it matter?
What matters is that every output device has inherent limitations on what
colors it can reproduce. Whether it’s determined by the components in the
LCD display or the inks in your printer, these hard-and-fast limitations can’t
be overcome — only anticipated. This means that every output device has its
own device-dependent color space — its own gamut of reproducible color, in
other words. These device-specific color spaces are called color profiles and
they play an important role in your workflow.
Earlier in the chapter, I talk about color spaces and duly list them as sRGB,
Adobe RGB (1998), and ProPhoto RGB. I need to mention one more color
space — one you need to factor into the color-management equation — and
that’s Lightroom’s own working space. Essentially, Lightroom’s working space
is very similar to the ProPhoto RGB space. The important point is that it’s a
16 bit per channel space that can encompass all the colors your camera can
capture. Lightroom processes all images inside its working space.
By defining the color space in your photo (via the embedded profile chosen
on your camera), Lightroom can accurately convert that color information into
its working space. By using a custom monitor profile, you can accurately con-
vert that same color data in Lightroom’s working space into your display’s
color space, and at the same time, accurately send the changes you make to
Lightroom. Similarly, when you send a photo to your inkjet printer, you employ
a specific printer profile that enables Lightroom to convert the colors from its
working space to the output space. In the next sections, I show you how to get
accurate profiles for your output devices so that everyone — you, Lightroom,
and your output device — is on the same page when it comes to color.
Calibrating your monitor
When you unpack a monitor from its cardboard and Styrofoam wrappings,
plug it into your computer’s output jack, and power it up, you probably don’t
concern yourself with calibration or profiles. Although you might not realize
it, out of the box your monitor has a generic default profile that allows it to
display as best it can whatever data your computer throws at it. The generic
profile it uses isn’t made specifically for the monitor you’re looking at, but
rather for all monitors of that type. Unfortunately, not all monitors of a given
model are going to display exactly the same way because of variations in how
they’re built.

Lightroom, more so than any other application I’ve used, relies heavily on the
monitor’s profile to display your photos accurately. I have seen many users
frustrated with display problems after using Lightroom that all relate to a
poor and inaccurate generic display profile being used by the monitor.
To make sure you don’t end up with display problems, you need to turn to a
good hardware calibration and profiling device. This is commonly called cali-
brating your monitor, although that only tells half the story. Two operations
actually take place:
 Calibration: This is the process of actually changing how your monitor
displays color.
 Profiling: After a change is applied, the device creates a new profile so
that the display can function in a consistent manner moving forward.
Many calibration devices are available for this purpose — the Datacolor
Spyder3, X-Rite i1display2, and Pantone Huey come to mind right off the bat.
At the heart of each system is a colorimeter, which is a device that measures
the actual colors your monitor produces, so that a calibration can be made
and a profile can be created. I use the Spyder3 (as shown in Figure 3-1) on
both my laptop and LCD panel displays, and it serves me well.
Figure 3-1: Monitor calibration and profiling.
59
Chapter 3: Digital Photo Basics

Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
Whichever device you use — and I strongly suggest that you do use one —
the basic steps are the same:
1. Warm up your monitor and the device.
2. Disable screen savers and power management so that the monitor
state remains on and constant.
3. Reset the monitor to its factory default settings. 
Consult the monitor’s manual if you’re not sure how this is done.
4. Clean your monitor.
5. Launch the software that drives the device.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions. 
At the end of the process, the calibration device will have created the
new profile and put it into use.
Don’t be afraid to start with the default calibration settings and repeat the
process to get the best result. Moreover, one final reminder: It’s good practice
to recalibrate your monitor on a monthly basis.
Using printer profiles
The inks and the paper being used determine your printer’s color space.
Unlike monitors, it’s possible to get quite functional “canned” profiles for the
various paper types your printer can use. The paper manufacturers create
these canned profiles, and in many cases, you might get the best results from
a printer manufacturer’s own paper.
In fact, it’s very common for paper profiles to be included with the printer
driver installation. That means when you install the printer, you also get all
the profiles for that manufacturer’s papers. That said, it’s always worth your
while to download the latest-and-greatest printer driver and paper profiles
from the manufacturer’s Web site, as new-and-improved versions might have
been released since the time the disc included in the printer box was created.
If profiles for the paper you want to use on your printer do not exist, you
have two options:
 Create a custom profile: You can use a profiling device to create a
custom profile for installation on your system, along the lines of profiling
devices used for monitors. The manufacturers of some monitor calibra-
tion devices (Datacolor and X-Rite, for example) also produce hardware
for creating these printer profiles. Figure 3-2 shows the Datacolor spec-
trocolorimeter being used to create a custom profile.

 Have someone else create a custom profile: If you’re not interested in
investing in a profiling device, you can have one created for you. This
consists of you printing a target provided by the profile creation service,
mailing it to them, and they sending you the profile to install. Due to the
price and learning curve associated with creating a custom profile, this
may be the best option for a beginner.
Figure 3-2: The Datacolor spectrocolorimeter used to create a custom printer profile.
Printer profiles you download from a profile-creation service typically come
in an executable file that will install them in the correct location. If not, then
you can place them in the correct folder. Each operating system stores the
printer profiles in a unique location:
 Windows: \Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color
 Mac: /Library/ColorSync/Profiles
The thing to remember when it comes to printer profiles is that you need a
specific profile for each printer and paper combination that you plan to use. I
go over how to use these profiles when printing from Lightroom in Chapter 13.
Preparing for Hard Drive Failure
I want to wrap up this chapter on a cheery note. It’s not a question of if your
hard drive will fail; it’s a question of when. To prepare for that moment is
not a luxury, but a necessity. By preparing for this eventuality, you also build
61
Chapter 3: Digital Photo Basics

62
Part I: Setting Yourself Up for Success 
protection from accidental data loss and other calamities. You do yourself a
huge favor when you operate with the mindset that data-storage devices
aren’t like diamonds or packing peanuts. 
If you simply keep your data on a single hard drive, then you must really like
to walk on the wild side! If you have your data mirrored (meaning copied) on
another drive (or on some type of removable media), then you can breathe a
little easier. If you also have a third copy of your data stored in a different geo-
graphical location, then you not only get a gold star, but you’re now protecting
yourself against mechanical failure, acts of nature (fire, flood, earthquake, and
so on), as well as acts of humankind (theft, vandalism, and toddlers). 
The backup basics consist of two key ingredients:
 Redundancy: The more copies of your data you have, the more protec-
tion you’re afforded against the loss of any one copy. Keep in mind that
there is a law of diminishing returns here — you don’t want to spend all
your time creating and managing copies, do you?
 Routine: When you need to restore from a backup copy, you want it to
be as fresh as possible. The time between your last backup and actual
data loss is directly proportional to the number of tears you’ll shed after
you realize how much is gone. Whether you have an automated or
manual system for creating your backup copies, what matters most is
that you incorporate it into your workflow so that it becomes just as
important as image capture and processing.
In regards to Lightroom, you need to back up two types of data:
 The Lightroom catalog: This is the database where Lightroom stores
every bit of metadata, and every tweak, setting, and adjustment you per-
form while working in Lightroom. It’s critical that you include it in your
backup routine. Lightroom does have a backup function that you can
configure to run at a set interval. Lightroom’s backup function only
includes this database file.
 Your photos: Kind of goes without saying, but I want to make the point
that Lightroom’s backup function doesn’t include your actual photos.
I’m sure that your Lightroom catalog and photographs aren’t the only precious
data on your hard drive. For this reason, you might already have a systemwide
backup routine in place. If not, do yourself a huge favor and start today!

f you’re going to use Lightroom to manage your
photos, you ﬁrst have to establish a connection
between the location your photos are stored on
your computer and the Lightroom database. This is
the essence of the process known as importing —
and is (rightfully) the entire focus of Chapter 4.
After you’re up to speed on how to get your
photos into Lightroom, you’ll be ready to start
tackling all the important management tasks that
follow every photo shoot. By the end of Part II,
you’ll be a master at using Lightroom to keep your
portfolio lean, organized, and sorted. All your
photos will be just a few clicks away because each
ﬁle’s metadata ﬁelds will be bursting with the kind
of descriptive information you need to keep a
handle on which photo is where.

I
n a Lightroom context, “importing” is commonly thought of as “getting
your photos into Lightroom” and on the surface that appears to be what’s
happening. I use this conversational shortcut as much as anyone does, but
it’s not a literal description of what’s really going on. What’s really happening
is that data about your photos is being written into your catalog file. The
reason I make this important distinction — apart from it being true — is that
it’s been a source of confusion to many new Lightroom users. Some
people make the mistake of thinking their photos are somehow
being stored inside of Lightroom, and this just isn’t the case.
With that in mind, the Import process is where you intro-
duce Lightroom to your photos. During this introduc-
tion, Lightroom learns everything it can about each
photo. (Kind of like what you’d do if you were at one
of those awkward social gatherings and you met
someone new.) The way Lightroom learns is by read-
ing each photo’s embedded metadata and copying
that into its catalog. (Okay, you probably wouldn’t
do that with someone you just met at a party, so the
metaphor is starting to fall apart.)
In addition, based on your import settings and the loca-
tion of the source files, Lightroom might perform a few
other tasks as part of the Import process, including copying
or moving photos to a new location and renaming them, applying
user-generated metadata (like your copyright), applying keywords, or
even beginning the development process by applying a set of adjustments
(called “Develop settings”). Importing is a powerful operation that’s integral
to working with Lightroom. Put another way, you can’t work on any photo in
Lightroom that hasn’t first been through the Import process.

66
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Exploring the Import Photos Dialog Box
Lightroom’s Import Photos dialog box, shown in Figure 4-1, contains (going
from top to bottom) the following sections and controls:
 File Handling: The drop-down menu here gives you four file-handling
methods to choose from, with each one having a unique set of options
to configure. Note that you see only the file-handling options related to
the method you choose:
• Add Photos to Catalog without Moving: This option tells Lightroom
to simply note where each photo is stored on your hard disk and
add to the catalog. 
• Copy Photos to a New Location and Add to Catalog: You’re most
likely to use this option when you’re importing from a memory
card, but you can use it any time you want to copy files from one
location to another and import at the same time. In fact, when
importing from a memory card, Lightroom only offers you the two
Copy options — this one and the Digital Negative option. 
Because you’re copying files to a new location, you need to choose
a location to copy them to as well as a means to organize the fold-
ers that are going to be created. 
• Move Photos to a New Location and Add to Catalog: The configura-
tion options are the same as with the Copy file-handling method
I mention above. The only difference is that Lightroom moves the
files to the location you choose instead of copying them.
• Copy Photos as Digital Negative (DNG) and Add to Catalog: The
same Copy/Move configuration options exist with this method as
well. The difference is that during this copy process, the files are
also converted to DNG format based on your DNG Import
Preference settings (set in the preference file).
For more on DNG Import Preference settings, see Chapter 1.
 Don’t Re-import Suspected Duplicates: When you check this box,
Lightroom won’t import any photos that you already have in your catalog. 
 Eject Card after Importing: Check this box to have Lightroom automati-
cally unmount (safely disconnect) your memory card when the import is
complete. 
 Backup To: This option isn’t available when importing at the current loca-
tion. Its primary function is to provide a means to back up your memory
card when you “copy and import” from a memory card. Ideally, you would
check the box and then choose a backup location on an alternate drive.
When the operation is complete, you have your imported files safely
copied to two locations at the same time. After you verify the files are
unharmed, you can erase and reuse the memory card in good conscience. 

 File Naming: When copying or moving files during import, you’re given
the ability to rename the photos. If you don’t want to change the file-
name, just choose Filename from the drop-down menu.
 Information to Apply: With every type of import, you have the option to
get a head start on organizing, personalizing, and processing your
photos. Keep in mind that any information you choose to apply at this
stage is applied to all imported photos! These settings are also “sticky,”
which means the choices you make today will become the default for the
next import, so always double-check every field! Here are the options:
• Develop Settings: These are saved sets of Develop module adjust-
ments that you can create using your favorite settings. You don’t
need to apply them during import, but it can come in handy if you
know what you want to apply to every photo in the import. Set it
to None if you want to skip this option. All Develop presets are
accessible via the drop-down menu. 
• Metadata: This is an option you should take advantage of every
time. Even if it means only adding your copyright information,
you’ll be doing yourself a favor by getting that chore taken care of
right off the bat. Click the drop-down menu to create a Metadata
preset or apply an existing one.
• Keywords: Words that describe your photos and then help you find
them again later, keywords are relevant to all the photos being
imported. You can add keywords that are more specific later, but
you’re wise to get a jump on the process. 
• Initial Previews: Although Lightroom renders previews on the fly
as it needs to without your intervention, you can configure it to
begin rendering Standard-Size or 1:1 previews as soon as the
Import process is complete by choosing either option from
the drop-down menu. The other two options — Minimal and
Embedded & Sidecar — will cause Lightroom to pull in either the
low-quality or full-size previews (respectively) from the raw photos
first to show you your photos faster, but Lightroom will still even-
tually render its own previews as you need them after import.
 Preview: The Preview panel is enabled by clicking the Show Preview box
in the lower left of the dialog box. When enabled, you see thumbnail pre-
views of the photos you’ve selected for import. You can use the Check
All and Uncheck All buttons, or check and uncheck individual photos to
affect which photos you want to import at that time. The slider below
the Preview panel controls the size of the thumbnails.
When you’ve configured all the options to suit your needs, click the Import
button to begin the process. If you change your mind, you can click the
Cancel button to bail out. If you’re importing from a memory card, you also
see an Eject button, which you can use to remove your memory card safely if
you change your mind.

Actually Importing Your Photos into Lightroom
Okay, time to introduce Lightroom to some photos! Unless you just happened
to pick up this book, the Lightroom software, and your new digital camera
sometime earlier this afternoon, I’m guessing you already have some photos
on your hard drive that you’d like to import. I’ll go further out on a limb and
assume that you’re going to have new photos in the future to import from
your memory card. The workflow is the same in both cases, but the options
you encounter are going to have some subtle differences, so it wouldn’t hurt
to go over the basic process first, and then step through a couple of exam-
ples using different import methods. 
Employing an import workflow
Things you want to keep in mind before you start importing:
 What import method are you going to use?
 Are you going to back up your import?
 Is your metadata template up to date?

 Are there keywords you want to apply?
 Is there a Develop preset that you want to apply?
 Have you created a filename template for the file-naming convention
you want to use?
When you begin the Import process with all your ducks in a row, it saves you
a great deal of time down the road. Remember, the Import process provides
you with the opportunity to do more than just start looking at your photos in
Lightroom. To see what I mean, take a Big Picture look at an import workflow
that takes advantage of the Import process’s full potential:
1. Initiate the import.
You can initiate an import a number of ways. The method you choose is
partially determined by the location of your photos (memory card versus
hard drive), but nothing happens without you taking the first step.
2. Select the photos you want to import.
No matter where your photos originate, you have to choose which ones
to import.
3. Configure the settings to meet your input needs.
Having answers to the questions at the start of this section allows you to
quickly set up this dialog, and click that Import button.
With the Big Picture out of the way, time to sweat a few of the smaller details.
The next few sections help you navigate your way through the shoals of the
Import process.
Initiating the import
The Import Photos dialog box is the gateway all photos have to pass through
and you can open the door a number of ways:
 The Import button in the Library module. This method might be the
most common way to launch an import because the big Import button
in the Library module is easy to spot (and who doesn’t love to click a
button). It can be used when importing from any disk or device. (I cover
the Library module interface in Chapter 5.)
 Connecting your camera or a memory card to your computer. If you’ve
enabled this feature in Lightroom’s Preferences file ahead of time, the
Import Photos dialog box automatically launches whenever it detects the
presence of a memory card — either solo or as part of a digital camera.
This can be a real timesaver if the only time you connect a camera or
memory card is when you want to conduct a Lightroom import. A more
detailed discussion of Preference settings can be found in Chapter 1.
69
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

70
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
 Choosing File➪Import Photos from Disk from the main menu. Use this
option if you’re importing files already on your hard disk.
 Choosing File➪Import Photos from Device from the main menu. Use
this option if you’re importing from your camera or a card reader and
don’t have Lightroom configured to automatically detect a memory card.
 Drag and drop. You always have the option to drag and drop a folder of
images from your file browser right onto the Library module to start the
Import process.
Selecting the photos you want to import
If you’re importing photos that are already on your hard disk, expect the
Import Photos or Lightroom Catalog dialog box to pop up on-screen after
initiating the import via the Import button or the File➪Import Photos from
Disk menu option. This is an operating system (OS) dialog box and as such
appears differently based on the OS you are using. Figure 4-2 shows the
Windows version and Figure 4-3 shows the Mac version.
I’ve seen a great deal of confusion caused by that dialog box, so I want to take
the time to set the record straight. Because it’s an OS-level dialog box, it has
limitations in functionality that are related to the OS and not Lightroom. The
most common problem being that the operating systems aren’t so good at
displaying raw previews quickly (or at all, in some cases).
Figure 4-2: Windows version of the Import Photos or Lightroom Catalog 
dialog box.

Figure 4-3: Mac version of the Import Photos or Lightroom Catalog 
dialog box.
The purpose of this dialog box is to provide a means to find and choose the
folder(s) or photo(s) that you want Lightroom to import. That’s what it does
and that’s pretty much all it does. In other words, it’s just a transitional
phase of the Import process, something to help you make your selection and
then get out of the way so that Lightroom’s Import Photos dialog box can
take over and do the heavy lifting — the browsing, previewing, and file
naming you love.
On the Mac version the of the Import Photos or Lightroom Catalog dialog
box, the button you click after selecting a folder is labeled Choose, but the
Windows version is labeled Choose Selected. Clicking that button — whether
it’s Choose or Choose Selected — launches the Import Photos dialog box.
That takes care of importing photos already found on your hard drive. When
you’re importing from a memory card — rather than importing from your
hard drive — you already have a smaller pool of photo files you have to deal
with. No need, then, to add an extra OS-based dialog box to the mix. Whether
Lightroom is configured to detect a memory card automatically or you
choose the File➪Import Photos from Device menu option, you jump right to
the Import Photos dialog box, where you see previews for all the photos on
the card. Similarly, when you drag and drop a folder from your file browser
onto Lightroom’s Library module, you’re making that photo selection outside
of Lightroom; therefore, you jump right to the Import Photos dialog box. 
Although it may be true — in most cases — that you’ll want to import every
photo on the memory card, it’s still worth your while to scan through the
71
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

72
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
images using the dialog box’s Preview pane to verify that you really want to
import them all. Checking the Don’t Re-Import Suspected Duplicates box
ensures that you don’t import the same photos twice, but when scanning the
previews you might find you just don’t need to waste time importing some of
the photos. Uncheck the check box on any folders or photos displayed in the
Preview pane that you don’t want to import at that time.
Configure the settings to meet your input needs
Now that you know what photos you want to import, it’s time to make
choices regarding how they’re imported and whether you’re going to multi-
task a little and start processing them on their way in the door.
Back at the beginning of this chapter, when I first start talking about the
Import Photos dialog box, I mention that the dialog box gives you four file-
handling options. How you initiate the import determines which file-handling
options are available. From there, the file-handling method you choose deter-
mines what other import options are available. Let me explain.
If you initiate an import from a device (either automatically by inserting a
memory card/attaching a camera or manually via the menu or Import
button), you see only the following file-handing options:
 Copy Photos to a New Location and Add to Catalog
 Copy Photos as Digital Negative (DNG) and Add to Catalog
If you initiate an import from a disk, then you have all the file-handling
options available:
 Add Photos to Catalog without Moving
 Copy Photos to a New Location and Add to Catalog
 Move Photos to a New Location and Add to Catalog
 Copy Photos as Digital Negative (DNG) and Add to Catalog
Here’s why. If you’re importing from a device (say, a memory card), you don’t
want the Add Photos to Catalog without Moving option because memory
cards are only temporary storage devices. Lightroom knows this and skips
this option. The reason moving photos to a new location and then adding to
the catalog isn’t an option is also based on best practices for dealing with
memory cards. First, you don’t want to remove files from your memory card
until you can visually verify that the files have been copied safely to at least
one other disk (two if you want to be safe). The idea here is that you don’t
want to risk something going wrong in the moving process because you
haven’t yet created a backup. Second, it’s better to use your camera to re-
format the card when you’re ready to erase the contents than it is to let your

computer perform that task. When you reformat the card in-camera, it will
be done the best way for the camera, which means less chance of corrupted
data when the camera is writing files to the card in normal operation.
The Copy and the Move file-handling options include additional settings not
found when adding photos to the catalog without moving. The reason for this
is that when you’re adding without moving, you aren’t changing anything
about the photos. You’re simply telling Lightroom where they’re located and
getting on with the business of importing their data. It would follow that if
you’re choosing to copy or move the photos and then import, you would
need to tell Lightroom where you want them to go and if you want to change
their names in the process. To that end, when you choose one of the Copy or
Move file-handling options, you see the following options appear in the File
Handling section of the Import Photos dialog box:
 Copy/Move To: Click the Choose button to configure the destination
location for the files that are being either copied or moved.
 Organize: This option controls the folder structure that is created in the
Import process. There are three types of methods:
• Into one folder: This option allows you to put all your photos into a
single folder without regard for dates or original folder structure. 
• By original folders: This option is useful when you’re moving or
copying from a disk and you want to replicate the same folder
structure on the destination disk.
• By date: Lightroom provides eight date-based folder structures
(YYYY\MM-DD, YYYY\Month DD, and so on) to choose from. The
capture dates from the photos are used to create the actual dates
used, which is reflected in the space below the Organize field. The
slash separating some of the date options means a folder and sub-
folder structure will be created.
 File Naming: Provides the option to change the filenames when placed
in the destination folder. Choose Filename from the Template drop-down
menu if you want the filenames to keep the original names. An example
of how the filenames will look is displayed above the Template field,
using the selected template.
Lightroom’s file-renaming function is quite powerful and versatile. I feel it’s a
great option to have during import, but keep in mind that you can rename
files later in the Library module. So don’t feel pressure to do it at import.
Lightroom installs with a number of prebuilt filename templates for you to
use, but its true power is unleashed when you use the Filename Template
Editor, as shown in Figure 4-4, to create your custom templates. You access
the editor by clicking the Template drop-down menu and choosing Edit.
73
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

74
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Figure 4-4: The Filename Template Editor.
The editor works by using what it calls “tokens” to represent various text
strings that you can assemble into various configurations. There are tokens
for image name data, image numbering options, date formats, metadata, and
even custom text. The assembled tokens can then be saved as reusable tem-
plates anytime you want to rename files. (You’ll use the same editor and
tokens if you rename after import as well.)
Click through the various sections to get a sense of what data is possible
to include in your filenames. I’d like to call your attention to two tokens in
particular: 
 Import #: You can use this token to include the import number in your
filename. The Import Number is managed from the File Handling tab of
the Catalog Settings dialog box (File➪Catalog Settings). 
 Image #: You can include this token when you want to number files incre-
mentally across multiple imports. Controlled by the Photos Imported
value, Image # is managed from the File Handling tab of the Catalog
Settings dialog box (File➪Catalog Settings).

I bring these to your attention because it can be hard to draw the connection
between what those tokens represent and the Catalog Settings dialog box.
(You can learn more about these settings in Chapter 2.)
To see what I’m talking about, follow along as I walk through an example
where I create a custom template that combines date information and part of
the original, camera-generated filename (refer to Figure 4-4 to see what the
template ends up looking like):
1. Click the Template drop-down menu, and choose Edit.
Doing so launches the Template editor. When the editor opens, notice
that the active template displays in the Preset field at the top of the
editor and that the tokens that make up that template appear in the
Editing field. Take a moment to click through the other templates and
see how the tokens are constructed. 
2. Delete any tokens that appear in the editing field.
Start with a clean slate. Just click into the field behind the tokens and
press Backspace (Delete on a Mac). Notice the example above the field
changes as you add or remove tokens to preview how the filename will
look.
3. Click the drop-down menu in the Additional section of the editor and
choose the Date (YYYYMMDD) token.
Just selecting from the menu adds the token to the editing field.
4. Click the editing field behind the date token and type an underscore.
You aren’t limited to using just the tokens to build your filenames. You
can type right into the editing field. Just remember that with filenames
you don’t want to make them any longer than you have to and you want
to avoid all nonalphanumeric characters except for dashes and under-
scores to prevent potential problems down the road. (I prefer the under-
score to a dash any day.)
5. In the Image Name section of the editor, choose the Filename Number
Suffix token from the drop-down menu.
This is the camera-generated file number. I use it because, when com-
bined with the date, I know it’s going to produce a unique filename. That
completes the contents of this template.
6. Click the Preset drop-down menu at the top of the editor and choose
Save Current Settings as New Preset.
Doing so opens the New Preset dialog box. In case you haven’t noticed,
the folks at Adobe use the words template and preset interchangeably.
Don’t let that confuse you.
75
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

76
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
7. Give the preset (template) a descriptive name and click Create.
I usually name my templates so that they mirror somewhat how the file-
name will look. In this case, I named it YYYYMMDD_suffix. After you
click Create, you see this name appear in the Preset menu.
8. Click Done.
You’re brought to the Import Photos dialog box with your new template
selected.
Regardless of the file-handling method you use, you always have the option
to apply three different types of information to all the imported files:
 Develop Settings: While some prebuilt Develop settings are available to
you out of the box, I don’t recommend using any at this point. Applying
a Develop setting to all photos at import can be helpful at times (like
when you’re shooting in a studio and you want to apply a custom white
balance setting), but the majority of your imports can do without
Develop settings — which means you should leave this set to None.
 Metadata: There’s no reason not to apply a basic set of metadata to all
imported photos. Create a preset (more on that later) that contains your
basic copyright and contact information and apply it every time.
 Keywords: Keywords identify your photos and — when used consis-
tently — provide a powerful means to find specific photos after your cat-
alog grows. It isn’t a sexy aspect of the Import process, but do it and
you’ll reap the rewards. During import, you only want to be careful
about getting too specific because the keywords you enter here are
going to be applied to every imported photo in the session.
The process for creating a Metadata preset is worth a closer look. You can
create an unlimited number of Metadata presets, which can be applied either
during import or later in the Library module. I create a baseline preset
(meaning information that I want on all photos regardless of subject, job, or
location) containing all my relevant information (copyright, name, contact
info, etc.) as well as additional presets for my wife and my son with their
respective information. That way, depending upon whose images are being
imported, it’s easy to apply the relevant preset right from the start. To create
a basic Metadata preset, you do the following:
1. In the Information to Apply section of the Import Photos dialog box,
choose New from the Metadata drop-down menu.
Doing so launches the New Metadata Preset dialog box, as shown in
Figure 4-5.
2. Enter a name for your new preset in the Preset Name field.

Figure 4-5: The New Metadata Preset dialog box.
3. Fill out all the fields in the IPTC Copyright and IPTC Creator fields.
This is the basic information about who holds the copyright to this
photo and how to contact them. Adding it here means it’s written into
the metadata of your exported files and can be written to the XMP meta-
data of your source files.
I often am asked how to create the (c) symbol so that it can be included
in the Copyright field. On Windows, if you have a separate number
keypad, hold down the Alt key and press 0169 on the keypad, and then
release the Alt key. If you’re on a laptop with a keypad overlay on your
regular keyboard, hold down the function (Fn) key and the Alt key and
press 0169. If you’re on a Mac, hold down the Option key and press G.
4. Click the Create button.
This saves the preset using the name you entered in Step 1 and closes
the metadata editor. You see the new preset in the Metadata field of the
Import Photos dialog box.
77
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

78
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
The last setting to configure before clicking the Import button is Initial
Previews. I discuss the role of preview files in Lightroom in Chapter 2, but the
main thing to know here is that Lightroom begins rendering the previews
after the Import process is complete. This setting determines the size of the
previews it starts creating after import. Here are your options:
 Minimal: With Minimal selected, the lowest-resolution previews are
grabbed from each file as quickly as possible. Lightroom renders its pre-
views only as needed when you are working.
 Embedded & Sidecar: Some photos have a larger or full-size preview
embedded within it (or its companion metadata file). With this option,
that preview is grabbed first, which may provide higher initial quality
viewing over Minimal. Lightroom still renders its previews only as
needed when you are working.
 Standard: In Chapter 2, I discuss how to configure your initial settings
for controlling the quality and size of the “standard” preview. This set-
ting tells Lightroom to go ahead and start rendering standard-sized pre-
views based on those settings for all recently imported images.
 1:1: This is a full-size, pixel-per-pixel preview of the source file that
Lightroom displays when you are viewing photos up close in the Library
module. With this option is set, Lightroom doesn’t wait until 1:1 pre-
views are needed; instead, Lightroom just starts rendering them after
the import is complete.
Note: No matter what setting you use, Lightroom still renders the previews it
requires when needed. The main purpose of the setting is to give you a little
control over this background process that happens after the import is com-
plete. I routinely set it to Standard.
Putting it all together
The two most common types of imports you perform are the Add Photos to
Catalog without Moving and the Copy and Add variants. I’d like to walk
through the steps for each type.
When I first started using Lightroom, I had tens of thousands of photos
already on my hard drive. I wanted to manage them all with Lightroom, but I
wanted to keep them right where they were on my hard drive. This scenario
demands that you use the Add Photos to Catalog without Moving file-handling
method. Here are the steps:
1. Click the Import button in the Library module. 
Note: To get to the Library Module, press G from anywhere in
Lightroom.

2. Navigate to the top-level folder that contains your photos (via the
Import Photos or Lightroom Catalog dialog box) and select it.
I keep all my photos on a separate drive in a Photos folder. Within that
folder, I have a subfolder for every year, and within each year, there’s a
folder for each day I was shooting. I like this date-based approach because
it’s simple, because Lightroom can automatically generate the structure,
and because every photo has a single permanent home. The problem I
have with any type of categorical structure is that there’s always the
possibility that I might have a photo that could fit into more than one
category. I don’t want to duplicate a file and I don’t even want to waste
time thinking about where to put it. Therefore, I use dates for storage,
and then use keywords and collections to create and access my photos
in Lightroom. It works for me.
So, in my case, I’d select the Photos folder. In your case, it might be the
My Pictures folder, or whatever folder you use to hold all your photos.
3. Click the Choose Selected button (Choose on a Mac).
The Import Photos dialog box appears.
4. Using the Preview pane of the Import Photos dialog box, scan through
the previews and uncheck any photos you don’t want to import.
You might want to import them all, which is fine, but it’s always worth a
quick scan through the previews.
5. Choose Add Photos to Catalog without Moving from the File Handling
drop-down menu.
6. Check the Don’t Re-import Suspected Duplicates check box.
7. From the Develop Settings drop-down menu, choose None.
8. Select an existing preset from the Metadata drop-down menu — or
select Edit and create a new one.
9. Apply any globally applicable keywords.
10. Set Initial Previews as desired.
This is a personal preference. As I said, I generally set it to Standard.
11. Click the Import button.
After that final click, you see the progress meter advancing as thumbnails
start appearing in your catalog. Likewise, the Folders panel shows the
imported folders. You can start working with photos as they appear, but I
usually busy myself with other tasks until Lightroom has completed the job.
After I get all my legacy photos imported, I tend to import all new photos
directly from the memory card. I do want to recommend the use of a card
reader over directly connecting your camera. A card reader is cheap and
portable, doesn’t drain your camera batteries, and frees up your camera for
taking more photos if you have multiple memory cards. Card readers often
79
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

80
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
provide a faster data transfer rate than most cameras do. Card readers are so
common these days that many laptops and monitors have them built right in!
Time to go through the steps for importing from a memory card — no matter
how you connect the card to the computer. I’m assuming you’ve disabled the
Show Import Dialog When a Memory Card is Detected preference setting just
so I can show you the manual method:
1. Connect your memory card to the computer.
2. Click the Import button in the Library module. 
This opens the Import dialog box (Figure 4-6). I want to call your attention
to it because you only see it when you have a device with a memory card
connected and use the Import button in the Library module. Because that
Import button works for both import from “disk” and “device,” it gives you
the option to choose which way to go.
3. Select your memory card from the Import dialog box.
This opens the Import Photos from dialog box, where you see your
incoming photos.
4. Scan through the previews and uncheck any photos you don’t want to
import.
5. Choose the Copy Photos to a New Location and Add to Catalog option
from the File Handling drop-down menu.
6. For the Copy To line, click the Choose button and navigate to where
you want the photos copied to.
7. Click the Organize drop-down menu and choose how you want the
photos organized.
I made my case for a date-based structure, but choose what suits your
needs best.
Figure 4-6: The Import dialog box.

8. Check the Don’t Re-import Suspected Duplicates check box.
9. Check the Eject Card after Importing check box.
10. Check the Backup To check box and configure a backup location.
This isn’t a required step, but I highly recommend you consider a work-
flow that involves backing up your memory card during import. You only
need it once for it to prove its value.
11. Choose a file-naming template from the Template drop-down menu. 
12. From the Develop Settings drop-down menu, choose None.
You are free to choose one if it suits your needs.
13. Click the Metadata drop-down menu and select an existing preset —
or create a new one.
14. Apply any globally applicable keywords.
15. Set Initial Previews as desired.
This is a personal preference. As I said, I generally set it to Standard.
16. Click the Import button.
The Import process is now underway. After the progress meter is complete,
it’s safe to remove your memory card. Always visually verify all the photos
are where they’re supposed to be before formatting that memory card!
Automatic Import
Under Lightroom’s File menu, you find an Auto Import option. Any time you
can automate a repetitive process, it’s a good thing! Lightroom’s Auto Import
is handy when you’re shooting tethered (meaning your camera is connected
to your computer while you are shooting) or when you just want to set up a
folder that will trigger Lightroom to import files as soon as they appear in the
folder (such as images you create while working in another application).
To open the Auto Import Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 4-7), choose
File➪Auto Import➪Auto Import Settings from the main menu. The Auto
Import Settings dialog box performs the same function and is identical to
the Import dialog box, with the following exceptions:
 Watched Folder: The idea here is to save in this folder the photos you
take. As soon as Lightroom sees a photo hit this folder, it initiates the
Auto Import process. If you’re shooting tethered, this is the folder where
you should save the photos from your camera.
 Destination: This location is where Lightroom moves your photos to
during the Import process. This keeps the watched folder empty. The
Destination folder appears in your Folders panel after the import.
81
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

82
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Figure 4-7: The Auto Import Settings dialog box.
There’s no preview because this needs to be configured before you have
photos ready to import. In fact, the watched folder needs to start empty for
the process to function correctly.
Just like a normal import, you want to configure your filename template and
metadata template, add keywords, configure previews, and even apply a
Develop preset if needed. If you’re shooting tethered, this might be a great
time to apply a Develop preset. If you’re going to be working under the same
lighting for the duration of the shoot, you could take a test shot and import
it. Correct the white balance in the Develop module and save it as a Develop
preset. You could then apply that preset to the rest of the images when
they’re imported!
Because shooting tethered is the most common use of Auto Import, it makes
sense for me to go through what’s involved and what steps are required.

The most critical component of the Auto Import operation isn’t even in
Lightroom. In fact, Lightroom doesn’t interact with your camera at all. What
you need is software that allows you to control your camera from your com-
puter. Some camera manufacturers bundle this type of software (or a limited
version of it) with your camera, but others make you pay for it. (Check with
your camera manufacturer.) Third-party applications also provide camera-
control support for many cameras (check out bibblelabs.com, for one promi-
nent example). The purpose of this software is to allow your camera to save
photos directly to a specified location on your hard drive (that is, the watched
folder) instead of on the camera’s memory card. After you have that software
installed and operational, you’re ready to move forward.
Here are the steps to setting up Auto Import for tethered shooting:
1. Choose File➪Auto Import➪Auto Import Settings from the main menu.
2. Click the Choose button next to Watched Folder and select the empty
folder you want Lightroom to watch.
3. Click the Choose button in the Destination section and select the
folder you want Lightroom to move the imported photos into.
4. Choose a filename template from the File Naming drop-down menu.
5. From the Develop Settings drop-down menu, choose a Develop preset,
if applicable.
I mention earlier that this scenario is a great candidate for applying a
Develop preset during import. It’s beyond the scope of this chapter to
cover the creation of Develop presets, but check out Chapter 7 for in-
depth coverage.
6. Choose a Metadata preset from the Metadata drop-down menu.
7. Apply globally applicable keywords to this import session.
8. Configure the Initial Preview setting.
9. Click OK.
10. Choose File➪Auto Import➪Enable Auto Import from the main menu.
At this point, Lightroom is ready and waiting for that first photo to land
in the watched folder.
11. Connect your camera to your computer.
12. Launch your camera control software and configure it to save photos
into the watched folder you configured in Step 2.
This process is going to vary with each camera-control software, but the
end goal is the same. Double-check that photos are being saved into the
watched folder before moving to the next step.
83
Chapter 4: Tackling the Import Process

84
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
13. Take a test shot with your camera.
You should first see an indication from the camera software that the file
is being transferred to the computer. After that transfer is complete,
Lightroom should automatically begin the import. 
If your test shot was successful, then you’re ready to begin shooting your job.
If the test was unsuccessful, double-check that you enabled Auto Import in
Step 10, that the camera is actually saving photos to the watched folder, and
that the watched folder starts out empty.

Just like your friendly local public library, the Library module is the
place you go to find and check out your photos. Except in this
case, you’re also the head librarian and that means you have
the power to organize and manage the contents as well.
The Library module is Lightroom’s hub — all your
photos pass through here on their way to the other
modules and beyond. Feel free to make as much
noise as you want.
You can do a heck of a lot to your photos in the
Library module — hopefully good things, but you
never know. This chapter focuses primarily on the
operations performed with the organizational panels.
For help on sorting, developing, and applying various
types of metadata to your photos, you need to turn to
Chapter 6.

86
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Exploring the Library Module
When you first enter any building, you need to become oriented to the lay of the
land. Although each of Lightroom’s modules contains tools and options that are
task specific, the layout of the interface is essentially the same. This common
interface is designed to help you become acclimated to the modules as you
move through them. More importantly, the common interface clues you in that
you can modify many elements of the interface the same way across modules.
Refer back to Chapter 1 for a complete rundown of the interface controls.
Getting to know the panels and tools
The Library module, shown in Figure 5-1, is sure to become a frequent stop in
your workflow. Every imported photo makes at least a brief appearance here,
even if it’s their last. The top of the interface provides the means to access
menus and move between modules. The left set of panels provides the main
access route to your photos; whereas, the right set of panels helps you mess
around with your photos. Smack-dab in the middle is the content area, which
is the place to get a closer look at your photos. As for the other elements, the
following list details the ones you should probably spend some time getting
to know. (For those following along using Figure 5-1, I’m starting in the top-left
corner and moving down.)
Figure 5-1: The Library module.

 Identity plate: Also the vanity plate, this is a customizable component of
the interface that you can use to make Lightroom your own.
 Navigator panel: Displays a preview when you move over photos in the
Filmstrip. Sets the zoom level in Loupe view.
 Catalog panel: Contains a small set of collections for quick access to
imported photos. In Lightroom terms, a collection is just a special
grouping of photos. The ones that appear in this panel are automatically
created by Lightroom. You can create your own using the Collections
panel (discussed below).
 Folders panel: Provides direct access to the folders that contain your
photos on your disk.
 Collections panel: Contains all your collections and provides tools for
organizing and creating additional collections.
 Filmstrip: Displays thumbnails of all the photos in the current grouping.
 Filter Bar: Harnesses the power of the Lightroom catalog to find and
filter your photos based on a wide range of criteria.
 Content area: Where your photos display in each of the Library module
view modes.
 Toolbar: Contains a set of tools for completing organizational tasks —
stuff like applying ratings, changing the sort order, and switching
between Library module views (to name a few).
 Module Picker: Allows for quick movement between various Lightroom
modules.
 Histogram: Displays a graph of the tonal values contained in the active
photo.
 Quick Develop panel: Allows for the application of Develop settings and
presets while working with photos in the Library module. I cover this
panel in greater detail in Chapter 6, but the real Developing tools are
covered in Chapters 7 and 8.
 Keywording panel: Provides a display of keywords applied to selected
photos as well as a means to apply additional keywords.
 Keyword List panel: Displays a list of all the keywords contained in your
catalog as well as tools to create, edit, and remove them.
 Metadata panel: Metadata is data about the data about a photo, if that
makes any sense. Basically, we’re talking about camera-generated infor-
mation that gets recorded when you press the shutter (f-stop, shutter
speed, etc) as well as photographer-generated information to go along
with it (title, description, location, etc). This panel provides a means for
viewing, adding, and editing each photo’s metadata.

Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library

Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Becoming familiar with the menu options
There’s often more than one way to perform any single task, but the menu
options are usually the single location that contains all the options. What’s
more, the menu options provide the added benefit of displaying the associ-
ated keyboard shortcut (if there is one). Therefore, it’s worth becoming famil-
iar with the menus to get a good sense of what is possible in each module.
The Library and Metadata menus are unique to the Library module, the
Photo menu pops up in Library and Develop, but their siblings — File, Edit,
View, Window, Help — appear in all:
 Lightroom (Mac only): Contains the commands for opening Lightroom’s
preferences, catalog settings, and identity plate setup.
 File: Provides access to all the import and export commands, controls
for quick collections (one of the special collections in the Catalog panel)
as well as the plug-in manager and plug-in extras.
 Edit: You find the Undo and Redo commands here as well as all the selec-
tion commands. If you have a Windows machine, this is where you go to
edit Lightroom’s preferences, catalog settings, and Identity Plate Setup.
 Library: Home to the commands for creating new collections and fold-
ers as well as advanced filtering options and preview controls.
 Photo: Go here if you want to do stuff to your photos, like opening them in
your file browser or an external editor, stacking them with other photos,
creating virtual copies of them, rotating them, applying flags, ratings or
labels to them, or removing them from Lightroom and your disk.
 Metadata: Here you find controls for adding and managing metadata,
which also includes keywords.
 View: Commit this one to memory, as it contains the most used key-
board shortcuts for switching between various views across modules.
Equally important are the view options for Grid and Loupe views (more
on those later).
 Window: Use the Window menu to access commands for switching
between modules, changing screen modes, and selecting options for the
secondary display.
 Help: Here you find commands for accessing the Help file (both locally
and online), checking for updates, and module-specific shortcuts.
You can access many of these same options by right-clicking (Control+click
on a Mac) a thumbnail, which calls up a contextual menu similar to the one
shown in Figure 5-2. 

Figure 5-2: Contextual menu options.
Creating a custom identity plate
In going over the menu options under the Edit menu (Lightroom menu on a
Mac), I mention an item called Identity Plate Setup that deserves more atten-
tion. This menu option controls the appearance of the Module Picker. Beyond
the Module Picker, the identity plate (also, a vanity plate) can appear in a few
other places within Lightroom:
 In a slideshow
 In print layouts
 In Web galleries
In all cases, the identity plate provides you with an opportunity to personalize
or “brand” both Lightroom and the work you output from Lightroom. In this
section, I show you how to customize your Module Picker, but do keep in mind
that the design you come up with here is going to show up in other places too. 
89
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 

90
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Basically, you have two types of identity plates:
 Styled text: Allows you to type in the text you want to use and then con-
figure the font face, size, and color.
 Graphical: Allows you to include your own logo — image or text — that
you design as a graphic in Photoshop. Keep in mind that you only have
57 pixels in height to work with, although it can extend behind the
Module Picker buttons if that’s what you want. Graphics can also con-
tain transparency, which allows the black background to show through.
As for which file format to use, I’d say the PNG file format is best suited
for creating a graphical identity plate on either Windows or Mac.
The first three steps for customizing the identity plate are the same for either
styled text or graphical identity plates:
1. Choose Edit➪Identity Plate Setup (Lightroom➪Identity Plate Setup on
a Mac) from the main menu.
Doing so launches Identity Plate Editor as shown in Figure 5-3.
2. Check the Enable Identity Plate check box.
This box has to be checked to enable any changes you make in the
editor.
3. Click either the Use a Styled Text Identity Plate radio button or the Use
a Graphical Identity Plate radio button, depending on your preference.
Figure 5-3: The Identity Plate Editor.

What happens after that depends on the type of identity plate you create. If
you’re creating a text identity plate, you do the following:
1. Still in Identity Plate Editor, select the text in the Editor window.
The changes you make are going to affect only the selected text.
2. Type the text you want to display.
3. Reselect the text and then choose your desired font from the Font
drop-down menu.
4. Choose the look for your font from the Font Style drop-down menu.
Some fonts have additional styles beyond Regular, such as Bold or Italic.
5. Choose the font size you want from the Font Size drop-down menu.
You can also highlight the number and enter a new value.
6. Click the color swatch to launch the Color Picker and choose the color
of the text.
Because changes are applied only to the selected text, you can choose to
style individual words (and even characters) with different colors and font
faces. Mix, match, and experiment!
If you’re creating a graphical identity plate, you do the following after clicking
the Use a Graphical Identity Plate radio button:
1. Still in Identity Plate Editor, click the Locate File button.
2. In the dialog that appears, navigate to the location of the graphic you
want to use.
Graphics in PNG format are your best choice here because they offer
transparency, reasonable file size, and work equally well on Windows
and Macs. Remember the 57 pixels height limit!
3. Select the file and click Choose.
After you have the identity plate looking how you want (either text or graphic),
you can also modify the Module Picker buttons to better suit the look of your
plate. Click the Show Details button at the bottom of the Identity Plate Editor to
reveal the Module Picker button options as shown in Figure 5-4. Here are the
steps to modify the buttons:
1. Choose your desired button font from the Font drop-down menu.
When you select a font, the preview in the Editor updates to reflect the
choice. Select a new font if you’re not happy with how it looks.
2. Choose the look for your font from the Font Style drop-down menu.
Some fonts have additional styles beyond Regular, such as Bold or Italic.

Part II: Managing Your Photos 
3. Choose a size for your font from the Font Size drop-down menu. 
4. Click the left color swatch to open the Color Picker and choose the
color of the active button state.
This color indicates the active module.
5. Click the right color swatch to open the Color Picker and choose the
color of the inactive button state.
This color indicates the inactive modules.
After you have the Identity Plate and Module Picker buttons looking how you
want, click the drop-down menu at the top of the Editor and choose Save As.
Give this configuration a name and click Save. Click OK to close the Editor
and apply the new look.
Figure 5-4: Customizing the Module Picker buttons.
Choosing the Right View for the Right Task
You have a couple choices when it comes to seeing your photos while work-
ing in Lightroom, but more likely than not the view mode you choose will be
determined by the task you’re performing. Expect to spend most of your time
working with thumbnails in Grid view, with frequent dips into Loupe view to
check focus at 1:1. That’s how I use Lightroom, at least.
Grid view and Loupe view work hand in hand, and a few important keyboard
shortcuts make toggling between the two views rather seamless:
 Press G to jump to Grid view no matter what module you are in at
the time.
 Press E to jump to Loupe view from anywhere in Lightroom.
 From Grid view, select a photo and press Enter to jump to Fit Screen
in Loupe. Press Enter again to jump to 1:1. Press Enter one more time
to return to Grid view.
 From Grid view, select a photo, and then press and hold the Z key to
jump directly to 1:1 view. Release the Z to return to Grid view.

Working with thumbnails in Grid view
Grid view could also be called “Thumbnail” view because thumbnails are
what make up the grid. Grid view is the workhorse of view modes, the place
where you spend the majority of your time when you’re performing these
common organizational tasks:
 Organizing
 Sorting
 Moving
 Renaming 
You do perform those tasks now and then, don’t you? Whether you’re watch-
ing a new import roll in, clicking into a folder or collection, or performing a
keyword search of your portfolio, you’re going to end up seeing thumbnails.
The size of the thumbnails — and, by extension, how many thumbnails fit
within the content area — can be changed with the Thumbnails slider on the
Toolbar or by using the + and – keys on your keyboard.
If you can’t see your Toolbar, press T to toggle it on (and off if you don’t want
to see it). Click the drop-down arrow on the right end to enable/disable the
tools that appear on it.
Changing the look of the thumbnails
You have three different grid styles to choose from, all of which offer varying
amounts of additional data to appear with each thumbnail:
 Compact Cells
 Compact Cell Extras
 Expanded Cells
You can cycle through each cell style by pressing the J key and can configure
what information you want to appear in each cell style from the Grid View
Options dialog box. Here’s how:
1. Choose View➪Grid View Style➪Compact Cells from the main menu.
2. Choose View➪Grid View Style and uncheck Show Extras in the menu.
You’re now looking at unadorned thumbnails. This view is great when
all you want to see are photos and nothing but the photos. If this strikes
you as a bit too stark, keep on reading.
3. Choose View➪View Options.
Doing so opens the Library View Options dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-5, with the Grid View tab active.
93
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 

94
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Figure 5-5: The Library View Options dialog box.
The reason I want you to go through Steps 1 and 2 here are that this is a
live dialog box, meaning that while you enable options in the dialog box,
you see them appear on the thumbnails. By entering the dialog from the
most compact state, you see that all but two options are disabled. Those
are the only options for Compact Cells with no extras. I recommend leav-
ing them checked. Now you only have Compact Cell Extras and Expanded
Cell Extras to configure.
4. In the Library View Options dialog box, check the Show Grid Extras
check box.
Compact Cells should be displayed in the Show Grid Extras drop-down
menu and all the options are now configurable. Notice that the thumb-
nails are now showing large index numbers behind them. You are now
in Compact Cell Extras view. Ignore the Expanded Cell Extras section 
for now.

5. Using the Compact Cell Extras section of the dialog box, configure
Compact Cell Extras as desired.
How you configure this style is up to you, but the only change I make is to
uncheck Index Number. The index number is a count of each photo in the
grouping you’re looking at. I find it to be useless and confusing because
the number changes based on the filtering and sort order you’re using. If
you find it helpful, by all means, keep it. Otherwise, I recommend just
going with the defaults.
6. Choose Expanded Cells from the Show Grid Extras drop-down menu.
Note that the thumbnails change to Expanded Cells view style in the
background.
7. Using the Expanded Cell Extras section of the dialog box, configure
Expanded Cell Extras as desired.
Again, Index Number appears as a default header label. Notice that the
header label drop-down menus are arranged in the same way they
appear within each thumbnails header. Click each drop-down menu to
choose the data you want to display. You have a wide range of metadata
to choose from — you can even choose None, which is what I do in
place of the Index Number.
8. Click the dialog box’s Close button.
Because the settings are applied while you work, there’s no need to save
them. After the dialog is closed, press the J key to cycle through each
style and see if it works for you. Change as needed.
Refer to the Cheat Sheet in the front of the book for a complete diagram of a
grid cell and all the icons, badges, and labels.
Changing the sort order
How your thumbnails are arranged within the content area is the sort order.
You can change the sort order with the controls in the Toolbar or by choos-
ing View➪Sort from the main menu. Capture Time is the most common sort
order, but the others can be useful, too. The one that causes the most confu-
sion is User Order, which is when you manually click and drag photos into a
custom order — confusing because it only works under specific conditions.
You can only apply a User Order when
 You’re working within a collection. Not collection sets or smart collec-
tions, though. Only when working within a single (regular) type of
collection.
 You’re working within a single folder. That folder cannot have any sub-
folders (even empty ones).
With that in mind, here’s what you do to change the sort order manually:
1. Click into a single folder or collection containing the photos you want
to sort.
95
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 

96
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
If you want to sort photos that reside across a range of folders, you first
need to put them into a single collection.
2. Click the center of the photo you want to move and hold the mouse
button.
Although it’s a photographer’s natural tendency, don’t grab the photo’s
frame (no need to worry about fingerprints here) because it won’t work. 
3. Move the photo to the new location in the order you want and release
when the separator line at that location darkens.
While moving the thumbnail, you’ll see the cursor change to a hand
holding a small thumb. Watch the lines between each photo darken as
you pass over them.
Making efficient use of space with stacks
Stacking is a folder-specific function that allows you to group photos into a
virtual “stack” so that only the top photo is visible. This is helpful in situa-
tions where you have multiple shots of the same subject and want to group
them under a single thumbnail, like when shooting for a panorama or HDR.
(But really, any reason that works for you is fine — you don’t have to justify
anything!)
To stack photos together:
1. Select all the thumbnails you want to group together.
You can select multiple photos either by holding the Shift key and click-
ing the first and last photo in a series to select them all, or by holding
the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac) and individually clicking each photo you want
to select.
2. Choose Photo➪Stacking➪
Group into Stack from the
main menu.
Lightroom brings the selected
photos together into a col-
lapsed stack.
Stacked photos are identified by a
bar on either end of the group of
stacked photos, as shown in Figure
5-6. You can expand and collapse the
stack by clicking either of those
bars, or by selecting one of the
stacked thumbnails and pressing S.
Figure 5-6: Stacked photos indicator.

Taking a closer look 
in Loupe view
When viewing a thumbnail isn’t adequate for
the job, it’s time to switch to Loupe view. The
easiest way to switch is to press E, which
switches you to Loupe view at the Fit setting.
The Navigator panel, as shown in Figure 5-7, is
Loupe view’s best friend, in that it displays a
thumbnail of the active photo. At the top of the
panel are the various zoom levels you can use
in Loupe view. The default zoomed-out state is
Fit, which means the entire image fits in the
content area, and the default zoomed-in state is
1:1, which means actual pixel view (or 100 per-
cent). Click each zoom level to activate, or click
the drop-down menu at the end to zoom in
some more. (All the way to 11 for you Spinal
Tap fans.) When Fill is selected, the photo is
zoomed in just enough to fill the entire content area.
The choice you make at the top of the Navigator panel will become the default
zoomed-out and zoomed-in state. I find Fit and 1:1 to be the most useful.
When you zoom in beyond Fit, you can click and drag the photo to inspect dif-
ferent areas of the photo, or click and drag the white square in the Navigator
panel to pan across the photo. Here’s an alternative (and more efficient)
method to inspect all areas of the photo when you zoom in beyond Fill:
1. Click the photo to zoom in.
1:1 works very well for this.
2. Press the Home key on your keyboard to jump to the upper-left
corner of the photo.
3. Repeatedly press the Page Down key on your keyboard to move over
the photo.
Each press of the Page Down key moves you an equal amount until you
reach the bottom, where one more press brings you back to the top but
over to the right. You can continue to press the Page Down key until
you’ve viewed the entire photo down to the lower-right corner.
4. Click on the photo to zoom out.
In practice, this process goes by rather quickly, and you’re guaranteed not to
miss one pixel of the photo this way.
Just like in Grid view, it’s possible to display some important information
about the active photo. Here it’s called the Loupe Info Overlay, and two 
97
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 
Figure 5-7: The Navigator panel.

98
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
versions allow for different sets of information to be displayed (but not at the
same time). You can cycle through each overlay and back to the Off position
by pressing the I key.
To set up your Loupe Info Overlay, choose View➪View Options from the main
menu to launch the Library View Options dialog box. It should open to the
Loupe View tab, as shown in Figure 5-8. 
Each Info Overlay can be configured by clicking its respective drop-down
menus and choosing the data you want to see. (Remember you get to set up
two sets of information.) The check box in the General section toggles on and
off the display of the loading and rendering messages that appear when photos
are opened in Loupe view. I find the messages to be a helpful reminder that
there’s something going on behind the scenes when first viewing a low-quality
preview, so I leave that box checked — and recommend you do the same.
Figure 5-8: The Loupe View tab of the Library View Options dialog box.

Using the Panels to Access Your Photos
The Catalog, Folders, and Collections panels provide multiple ways to view,
organize, and access your portfolio. Each offers a unique set of tools to help
you stay in control of your portfolio. The next few sections examine each
panel in turn. 
Getting the 20,000-foot view from the Catalog panel
The Catalog panel, shown in Figure 5-9, provides quick access to a few special
collections of your photos:
 All Photographs: Provides quick
access to all imported photos.
 Quick Collection: A temporary
holding place for photos. See
the upcoming section on collec-
tions for more information.
 Previous Import: Shows the
most recently imported photos.
Each new import clears the last
batch and adds the newest.
 Previous Export as Catalog: A temporary collection created with the
last photos you exported as a catalog. (This collection only appears
after a catalog export has been made.) Right-click (Control-click on a
Mac) the collection title to access the Remove option.
Using the Folders panel
like a file browser
The Folders panel, shown in Figure
5-10, displays a listing of all the fold-
ers of photos that you’ve imported
as well as the disk (or volume)
where the folders reside. Volumes
and folders can be expanded or col-
lapsed as needed to access the con-
tained photos. Volumes are arranged
in the order in which they’re
imported; whereas, folders within
each volume are arranged in
descending alphanumeric order —
an ordering that cannot be changed.
The Volume Browser — the bar that
appears above your top-most level
99
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 
Figure 5-9: The Catalog panel.
Figure 5-10: The Folders panel.

100
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
folder — indicates the name of the volume (disk) that your folders reside on
as well as a number of other functions:
 Shows at a glance where your photos reside. Previously, if you had two
folders of the same name on two or more disks, it could be confusing
trying to remember which folder was on which disk.
 Can be configured to display disk space, photo count, or online status.
Mine is set to disk space in Figure 5-10. Right-click (Control+click on a Mac)
and choose the information to be displayed.
 Provides a color indicator (think dashboard warning light) of how
much free space is on that disk. Green means plenty of space, but it will
turn to orange when it starts to get full, and then red when it is very low,
and black if that disk is offline.
 Allows for all the folders on a given volume to be collapsed under one
heading.
If your imported folders reside on more than one disk you’ll see a Volume
Browser for each disk (I have two disks showing in Figure 5-10).
Although the Folders panel looks a lot like your file browser (Windows Explorer
or Finder), it’s fundamentally different. The difference is that the Folders panel
shows only the folders and photos that have been through the Import process.
Your file browser, comparatively, simply browses the folder and shows its con-
tents. That difference aside, the Folders panel reflects the reality of your actual
folders in the following ways:
 The actual folder names are shown in the Folders panel.
 Changes made in the Folders panel are reflected on the actual folders.
Unfortunately, changes that you make to the folder structure outside of
Lightroom aren’t updated automatically in Lightroom. This is an area where
you can create problems for yourself. To avoid creating problems, only make
changes to the imported folders (and photos) from within Lightroom.
Adding new folders and subfolders to the Folders panel
Lightroom only shows the folders that have been imported; therefore, you
might decide at some point that you want the parent folder of one of your
imported folders to appear in the Folders panel. The quickest way to bring
the parent folder into Lightroom is to right-click (Control-click on a Mac) the
child folder in the Folders panel and then choose Add Parent Folder. The
parent folder immediately appears in the Folders panel; however, any photos
that it might contain will not be visible until they’re imported.
Another option is simply to create a new folder entirely. The benefit of doing
this in Lightroom is that not only is the folder created, but it’s also imported
at the same time. You can either create a new folder inside of one of your

existing folders (also referred to as a subfolder) or create a new folder in an
entirely different location. Here’s how the new subfolder thing works:
1. Select the folder you want to use as the parent folder for the new 
subfolder.
2. Click the + symbol at the top of the Folders panel and choose Add
Subfolder.
The Create Folder dialog
box appears, as shown in
Figure 5-11. Note that in the
Folder Options section, the
name of the folder you select
appears checked.
3. Enter a name in the Folder
field.
4. Click Create.
The new folder appears in the Folders panel under the previously
selected folder.
The process for creating a new folder in a new location is slightly different:
1. Click the + symbol at the top of the Folders panel and choose Add
New Root Folder.
Doing so launches the Browse for Folder dialog box.
2. Navigate to the disk location where you want this folder to be created.
3. Click the New Folder button to create a new folder, give it a name and
click OK (Choose on a Mac).
The new folder appears in the Folders panel.
The most common reason for adding
a new folder to Lightroom is so that
you can move photos or folders into
this new location. Folders can be
moved by clicking and dragging
them to the destination folder of
your choice within the Folders panel.
You can also move individual photos
by clicking and dragging them from
Grid view to the destination folder in
the Folders panel. After you drag a file or folder to a new location, Lightroom
prompts you to make sure you want to complete that action, as shown in
Figure 5-12. Click the Move button to proceed.

Figure 5-12: The Moving a File warning.

102
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Along with adding new folders, you might also feel the need to remove fold-
ers as well. If the folder you want to ditch is empty of photos and subfolders,
then right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the folder and choose Remove. The
folder disappears from Lightroom as well as from your Mac hard drive. (On a
Windows machine, that folder remains on your disk until you remove it via
your file browser.) If you remove a folder that contains photos or subfolders,
it is removed only from Lightroom. (Both Mac and Windows machines keep
such folders on their hard drives.)
Keeping the catalog in sync with the folders
If you’re outside of Lightroom and you decide to use your file browser to add
new photos to a folder that has already been imported into Lightroom, the
photos will not appear in Lightroom automatically. All photos have to go
through the Import process first. Lightroom’s Synchronize command is great for
making Lightroom take a closer look at a given folder and, if necessary, opening
the Import dialog to bring any additions into the catalog. Here’s how it works:
1. Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the folder you want to check.
2. Choose Synchronize Folder
from the contextual menu that
appears.
Doing so opens the Synchronize
Folder dialog box, as shown in
Figure 5-13. Depending on the
number of files contained in the
folder, Lightroom might take a
couple minutes to compare
what it knows about the folder
to what is actually in the folder
and to determine what action(s)
need to occur to get the two in sync.
3. Check the boxes for each operation you want Lightroom to perform.
You can have Lightroom
• Import new photos (with or without showing the Import dialog box).
• Remove any missing photos from the catalog file — photos that
were in the folder but might have been moved to another folder.
• Check for any metadata updates that might have occurred from
editing in a different application (such as adding keywords via
Adobe Bridge).
4. Click the Synchronize button.
Lightroom closes the Synchronize dialog box and performs the tasks
you assigned.
Figure 5-13: The Synchronize Folder dialog box.

Grouping photos into collections
The Collections panel, shown in Figure 5-14, is found just below the Folders
panel. Note: I created a few custom collections for demonstration, but by
default you would only see a set of smart collections (more on those later).
Although, on the surface, collections appear to function just like folders, they
have a critically important difference; they don’t exist outside of Lightroom.
You can open a file browser, navigate to a folder, and see what it contains, but
you could search your entire hard drive and never find a collection.
Folders are real, recognized by file
browsers the world over. Collections
are virtual folders, created out of thin
air by Lightroom for its purposes. In
the real world, if you want to place a
photo into more than one folder, you
have to make copies of the source file
and place one copy into each folder.
With collections, all you do is create
pointers to the source file. That way, a
single photo can be placed into as
many collections as you care to
create without ever needing to dupli-
cate the source photo.
Collections can contain photos from
all corners of your portfolio, which
makes them a powerful organiza-
tional tool. You might have a collec-
tion containing all your best work, or
all photos of a given subject, or perhaps one for each client. The purpose col-
lections serve and how you might name them are entirely up to you. I find
that they provide a very natural way to quickly access groups of photos
around a specific theme. 
You can create a collection a number of ways:
 Click the + symbol at the top of the Collections panel and choose
Create Collection.
 Choose Library➪New Collection from the main menu.
 Press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac).
You can organize collections within the Collections panel by putting them
into a collection set. (A collection set is simply a grouping of collections.) For
example, if you shoot weddings, you might have a collection set for each
client. Within that collection set, you might have a collection for the bride,
another for the groom, another for the family, and so on.
103
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 
Figure 5-14: The Collections panel showing
several custom collections.

104
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
To add a collection set, click the + sign at the top of the Collections panel
and choose Create Collection Set from the menu that appears. After you give
the set a name, it appears in the Collections panel. You can then drag and
drop existing collections into it. Collection sets cannot contain photos, only
collections.
Quick Collection
The Quick Collection, a useful variation on the Collections idea, can come in
handy when you just want to set some photos aside without putting them in
a permanent collection. Quick Collection resides in the Catalog panel, and
you place photos into the Quick Collection by doing one of the following:
 Selecting the photos and pressing the B key.
 Clicking the tiny Quick Collection indicator that appears in the upper-
right corner of each thumbnail.
This indicator, shown in Figure 5-15, is only visible when you place your
cursor over a thumbnail. (I take that back: You can also see the indicator
on photos you’ve already included in the Quick Collection.)
 Choosing Photo➪Add to Quick Collection from the main menu.
Those same options also work in reverse to remove photos from the Quick
Collection. You can clear all photos from a Quick Collection by choosing
File➪Clear Quick Collection. If you decide that you want to make a Quick
Collection permanent, you can save it by choosing File➪Save Quick
Collection. After giving the collection a name, it appears where all well-
behaved collections end up — in the Collections panel.
Figure 5-15: The Quick Collection indicator button.
Quick Collection indicator 

Smart collections
The addition of smart collections to Lightroom 2 is a great example of how
to leverage the power of a database to do work for you. True, you already
have all kinds of ways to group your photos by virtue of data they have in
common — just think of the Filter bar. However, smart collections take that
power to the Collections panel.
Now, instead of having to manually select photos and put them in a collec-
tion, you can create a smart collection that automatically pulls photos into it
based on the criteria you choose to include. To get you started, Lightroom
comes installed with five default smart collections:
 Colored Red: All photos with a red color label are included.
 Five Stars: All photos rated five stars are included.
 Past Month: All photos containing a Capture Date within the last month.
 Recently Modified: All photos with an Edit Date within the last two days.
 Without Keywords: All photos with an empty keyword field.
If none of these starter smart collections appeals to you, you can easily
delete them. Just select one (or more) and then click the minus sign in the
Collections header bar. Poof, they’re gone. If you want to see the rules gov-
erning a smart collection, you can right-click any smart collection and choose
Edit. Doing so launches the Edit Smart Collection dialog box, which spells out
in gory detail the parameters the smart collection is using. Feel free to tweak
the settings to better fit your needs and then click Save!
You can create as many smart collections as you need — and you don’t need
to start with one of the default sets. You can create one from scratch. One
smart collection that I use as a sort of safety net is designed to collect any
photo that is not marked as copyrighted in its metadata. Even though I
include the copyright setting when I import photos (see Chapter 4) there are
times when some photos lose that setting after being edited in an external
editor (see Chapter 9), so this simple collection automatically collects any
photos that would otherwise remain unnoticed. Here’s how to set up that
type of smart collection:
1. Click the plus sign on the Collections header bar and choose Create
Smart Collection from the contextual menu that appears.
Alternatively, you can choose Library➪New Smart Collection from the
main menu. This launches the Create Smart Collection dialog box shown
in Figure 5-16.
2. Enter a descriptive name in the Name field.
3. Choose a Collection set to put the collection in.
105
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Photos in the Library 

106
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Figure 5-16: Create Smart Collection dialog box showing a finished example.
4. Select All from the Match drop-down menu.
The idea here is that a photo has to match all the provided rules to be
included in the collection.
5. Choose Copyright Status from the First Rule drop-down menu — the
menu directly underneath the Match drop-down menu.
So, your first rule is now about Copyright Status. When you make that
first choice about what criteria you want to use for your rule, the con-
tents of the subsequent drop-down menus update automatically with rel-
evant criteria until the rule is complete. Next, you need to define what is
it about copyright status that you want to take notice of. In this example,
you want all photos not marked as copyrighted, so you’ll change that in
the next step. 
6. Choose Is Not from the bordering drop-down menu — the next part of
our first rule.
Great, so now you need to answer the question, is not what? Which
you’ll do in the next step.
7. Choose Copyrighted from the far-right drop-down menu — the last
part of our first rule.
So your smart collection is set to grab all photos whose copyright status
is not copyrighted. Perfect, that’s exactly what you want to happen.
8. Click the Create button.
The new collection appears in the Collections panel.

Creating Multiple Versions with Virtual Copies
Virtual copies are based on all Lightroom adjustments being recorded as a set of
instructions waiting to be applied at output. A virtual copy is essentially an alter-
native set of instructions that references the same source file as the original.
Here’s a simple example: You have a color photo and wonder how it might look
in grayscale, so you create a virtual copy and convert the copy to grayscale. In
Lightroom, you see two versions of that source file, one color and one grayscale.
If you look in the folder where the source file is saved, you see only the original.
The grayscale copy is simply an alternative set of instructions that is stored in
Lightroom’s catalog waiting to be applied during output.
A preview version of the virtual copy was created and stored in the preview
cache, but even at 1:1 size, the preview file requires far less disk space than
your original file (especially if it was raw).
You can recognize a virtual copy in Grid view by the page curl effect in the
lower-left corner, as shown in Figure 5-17.
Figure 5-17: The page curl effect represents a virtual copy.
You can create a virtual copy three separate ways:
 Choose Photo➪Create Virtual Copy.
 Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) and choose Create Virtual Copy
from the contextual menu that appears.
 Press Ctrl+’ (Ô+’ on a Mac).
If you decide that you prefer the virtual copy to the original, you can make it
the new master version of the file and make the old master into a virtual
copy. With the virtual copy selected, choose Photo➪Set Copy as Master. You
see the page curl effect “jump” from one thumbnail to the other.

O
ne of the first tasks I perform when working with a
batch of newly imported photos is to weed out the
worst of the bunch. I keep anything that has at least
some redeeming quality, but any poor exposures or
photos with improper focus are sent straight to the
trash. I do want to note that, even though photos I
flag as rejected are deleted from disk, I do retain an
archived copy of my original import as a fallback.
This provides me with enough peace of mind to be a
tougher critic of my own work, which I feel is integral
to my own growth. That’s one of the things I really like
about Lightroom; it gives me the tools I need to evalu-
ate my work in an efficient manner. 
An additional result of this tough love editing process is that I
won’t have to spend any time organizing, sorting, or applying addi-
tional metadata and keywords to photos I’m not going to keep. But that is just
my approach to this process. I’ve structured this material in the context of a
common workflow scenario to illustrate how certain functions work, and I
encourage you to develop and refine a workflow that best suits your style
and needs. 

110
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Evaluating Photos 
The Library module has four view modes — Grid, Loupe, Compare, and
Survey. I covered Grid (press G) and Loupe (press E) — the workhorse view
modes — in Chapter 5. You’ll still be using them as you move between
Compare and Survey (which I’ll tackle in just a bit). Each view can serve a
variety of purposes, but I find that when it comes to evaluating photos, the
Survey and Compare views are the ones I reach for most. They still work
hand in hand with both Grid view and Loupe view, but they offer different
ways to interact with — and see — your photos in relation to other photos. 
Although not a “view mode” per se, you do have one other way to see your
photos from the Library module — the Impromptu Slideshow. With this feature,
you can launch a full-screen slideshow and also apply flags, ratings, and color
labels as the images transition past. I talk more about Impromptu Slideshow —
as well as the more traditional view modes — in the next few sections.
Survey view
Survey view, as shown in Figure 6-1, is great when you want move from Grid
view to look only at a small group of photos by themselves. To enter Survey
view, just select the thumbnails that you want to look at together while in
Grid view, and press N. Don’t ask me why N is the shortcut, and don’t ask me
why it’s called Survey view, for that matter. I’m just here to tell you what’s
what. As an alternative (there’s always an alternative) you can enter Survey
view by selecting photos and clicking the Survey view button on the Toolbar,
choosing View➪Survey View from the main menu, or right-clicking
(Control+click on a Mac) a selected photo and choosing Open in Survey from
the contextual menu that appears.
Lightroom automatically arranges the selected photos to fit within the avail-
able content area. The more photos you select, the smaller each photo will
appear; whereas the more screen real estate you provide to the content area,
the larger the photos will appear. For this reason, you might find it helpful to
maximize the content area by
 Pressing F to jump to full screen.
 Pressing Tab to collapse both side panels.
 Pressing F5 to collapse the Module Picker.
The photo with the white border is the active photo (the one that any flags,
ratings, metadata, or adjustments will be applied to). You can use the arrow
keys on your keyboard to change the active photo or just click a different
photo to make it the active one.

Figure 6-1: Three photos shown in Survey view.
If you want to zoom in to take a closer look at any photo, just click it to make
it the active photo and press and hold the Z key to zoom to 1:1. As long as
you hold the Z key, you can pan around the photo (by clicking and dragging)
for closer inspection. When you’re done, just release the Z key to return to
Survey view. If you don’t want to keep holding the Z key down, you can just
press it once to jump to 1:1 Loupe view, examine the photo at your leisure,
and then press the Z key to return to Survey view. Either way, Lightroom pro-
vides you with a free round trip ticket to Loupe view and back.
You can also remove photos from this view (not the catalog) by clicking the X
icon that appears in the lower-right corner when you move your cursor over
the photo or by Ctrl-clicking (Ô+click on a Mac) the photo itself. As photos
are removed from view, Lightroom adjusts the remaining photos to fill the
newly available space. 
Compare view
The most useful view mode for side-by-side comparison of one photo to another
is the aptly named Compare view. This view is best for situations where you
have multiple shots of the same subject and you want to determine — after
careful consideration — which one you like best. To get Compare view up and
running, start out from Grid view, select the thumbnails you want to compare
and then press C. (You can also enable Compare view from the button on the
Library Toolbar, the main menu, or via the contextual menu.)

Part II: Managing Your Photos 
You can see an example of Compare view in action in Figure 6-2. Similar to
Survey view, Compare view fills the available content area. The trick here is
that Compare view limits itself to showing two photos at a time. Collapsing
panels to maximize your content area allows the photos to be as large as
possible.
Figure 6-2: Two photos in Compare view.
The first photo you select before entering Compare view will be labeled the
Select. The Select is the photo you are comparing against all the others.
When the other photos appear in the content area, they’re referred to as
the Candidate. The Select is always on the left and the Candidate is on the
right. You can see the Select and Candidate label appear as an overlay on
the photos themselves. (Refer to Figure 6-2.) Additionally, the Select has a
black diamond icon display on its thumbnail in the Filmstrip; whereas, the
Candidate displays a white diamond icon in the Filmstrip. The diamond icons
are helpful visual cues when you have a large selection of photos to compare.
You can use your arrow keys on your keyboard to swap other photos into the
Candidate position. 
The active photo has a white border around it in the content area. (The
Select is active in Figure 6-2.) Click either the Select or the Candidate in the
content area to set it as the active photo. When the Select is active, clicking
another photo in the Filmstrip sets it as the new Select. Likewise, when the
Candidate is active, clicking another photo in the Filmstrip sets it as the new
Candidate. The active photo is also the one that can have flags, ratings,
labels, quick develop settings, and metadata applied to it.

To aid the evaluation process, you can also zoom into each photo by either
clicking into the active photo or by using the Zoom slider on the Toolbar. If the
Lock icon on the Toolbar is closed (that is, locked), then both the Select and
Candidate zoom by the same amount. While zoomed and locked, you can click
the active photo and pan around, which results in both photos panning in
sync. If the Lock icon is open (that is, unlocked), you can zoom and pan each
photo independently of the other. Clicking the Sync button next to the Zoom
slider results in both photos being zoomed to the same section of each photo.
The Z key shortcut I describe in the Survey view section works here, too.
You can have the Candidate become the Select and the Select become the
Candidate by clicking the Swap button on the Toolbar, as shown in Figure 6-3.
You can also promote the Candidate to become the Select by clicking the
Make Select button on the Toolbar. (It’s the button just to the right of the
Swap button.) You can exit Compare view by either switching to a different
view mode or by clicking the Done button on the Toolbar.
Figure 6-3: The Compare view Toolbar buttons.
Impromptu slideshow
Sometimes it’s nice to just sit back and watch a show; a slideshow, that is. An
impromptu slideshow can be launched from any module, but I find it to be
especially useful in the evaluation process. You can launch a slideshow either
The Swap button

Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

114
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
by clicking the Slideshow button on the Toolbar, by pressing Ctrl+Enter
(Ô+Return on a Mac), or via the Window menu.
When you launch a slideshow, Lightroom displays the photos you selected
using the existing settings from the Slideshow module. If you want to make
any changes in how the impromptu slideshow performs, you need to change
the default settings in the Slideshow module.
While the slideshow is running, you can use keyboard shortcuts to apply
flags, ratings, and color labels to the on-screen photo. (Not sure about which
keyboard shortcuts to use? Don’t worry; I go over the keyboard shortcuts for
each in this chapter.) When you apply items, an icon for the applied item
flashes briefly in the lower-left corner of the screen as a visual cue that it’s
been set. Press the spacebar to pause the show (press it again to resume)
and the Esc key to exit. Nothing to it.
Adjusting Your Photos in the Library Module
Although not intended to take the place of the Develop module, the combina-
tion of the Histogram and the Quick Develop panels in the Library module
can provide valuable information about your photos and allow for tweaks
that can further inform your selection process. Quick Develop panel adjust-
ments can be applied while in the Grid, Loupe, Survey, or Compare views.
Using the Histogram to analyze your photos
A histogram, in the digital photo world, is a graph representing all the tones in
a selected photo. The left side of the graph represents the darker tones and
the right side represents the lighter. In the Lightroom interface, the
Histogram panel has a place of honor — first position — on the right.
At a basic level, a histogram can give you an indication of the overall expo-
sure of a photo. An overexposed photo shows points all stacked to the right
edge (see Figure 6-4); whereas, an underexposed photo shows points
bunched on the left (see Figure 6-5.). That said, Figure 6-6 shows a photo that,
although properly exposed for the moon, has a histogram with bunches of
points to the right because most of the image is dark. The moral of the story
here is to keep the subject in mind when viewing the histogram.

Figure 6-4: An example of an overexposed photo and its histogram.
Figure 6-5: An example of an underexposed photo and its histogram.
115
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

116
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Figure 6-6: An example of a properly exposed photo of a primarily dark scene.
The bottom of the Histogram panel displays the ISO, focal length, aperture, and
shutter speed of the active photo to aid in that photo’s evaluation. With all this
information, you can use the tools in the Quick Develop panel to make adjust-
ments without leaving the Library module. To see what kind of adjustments I
mean, check out the next few sections.
Making adjustments with the Quick Develop panel
The default Lightroom rendering of your raw photos may not always be
enough to judge the potential of a given photo. Perhaps a photo was slightly
underexposed, or perhaps the wrong white balance was selected in-camera.
Those issues (among others) can be corrected relatively quickly and should
not be the cause for you tossing out an otherwise good photo. The Quick
Develop panel, shown in Figure 6-7, gives you the tools to do some quick
rehab work on deserving photos.
The Quick Develop panel contains three subsections that can be collapsed or
expanded by clicking the arrow at the top of each subsection:
 Saved Preset: Provides quick access to all Develop presets, while also
letting you crop to any aspect ratio and switch between color and
grayscale.
 White Balance: White balance is the setting that compensates for the
color of the light used to capture the scene so that subjects appear in

the photo the way our eyes see
them (our brains do this for us
automatically). Note: The White
Balance preset options are dif-
ferent for raw photos and ren-
dered photos (JPG, TIFF, and
PSD files). When working with
raw data, an absolute white bal-
ance hasn’t been “cooked” into
the pixels, so it’s possible to
switch the absolute white bal-
ance value as needed. However,
all rendered photos have a
white balance value cooked into
the pixels when the file is cre-
ated, so all future white balance
adjustments are relative. When
working with a rendered file,
your White Balance preset
choices are limited to As Shot,
Auto, and Custom.
 Tone Control: This final subsec-
tion contains all the adjust-
ments affecting the tonal range
of the photo.
The Reset All button at the bottom
of the panel removes all adjustment
settings, including any adjustments
made in the Develop module.
However, you can reset any single
Quick Develop adjustment by
double-clicking the label of that
particular adjustment.
You can apply adjustments to the
active photo while in the Loupe,
Survey, and Compare views. When
in Grid view, any adjustments you
make are applied to all selected photos (not just the active photo). This “one
fell swoop” approach is handy during not only the evaluation process, but
also a real timesaver when you want to apply the same adjustment to a large
group of photos. 
117
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library
Figure 6-7: The Quick Develop panel with all
subsections expanded.

118
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
A good example of a bulk application of the Quick Develop panel is applying a
new aspect ratio to a group of selected photos in Grid view. Here’s how:
1. Press G to jump to Grid view.
2. Select all the photos you want to crop to the new aspect ratio.
3. Expand the Saved Preset section of the Quick Develop panel.
4. Select the desired aspect ratio from the Crop Ratio drop-down menu.
You see the thumbnails of the selected photos change to reflect the new crop
ratio. When you apply the crop in this manner, you center the crop in each
photo. Press R to jump to the Crop tool to tweak each crop for best composi-
tion. (I cover the Develop module’s Crop tool in detail in Chapter 7.) The ben-
efit of starting from the Quick Develop panel is that the aspect ratio is already
set when you enter the Crop tool, which greatly speeds the process.
Along the same lines, if you adjust a single photo (whether using Quick
Develop or the Develop module) and want to apply the same settings to mul-
tiple photos, you can use the Sync Settings button located at the bottom of
the right panel group. Here’s how:
1. Press G to jump to Grid view.
2. Select the adjusted photo first.
3. Select the other photos you want to sync with the same settings.
4. Click the Sync Settings button.
Doing so launches the Synchronize Settings dialog box, as shown in
Figure 6-8.
5. Check only the boxes that correspond to the settings you want to
apply to the other photos.
6. Click the Synchronize button.
You see all the thumbnails of the selected photos update to reflect the newly
applied settings from the first photo. 

Figure 6-8: The Synchronize Settings dialog box.
Making Choices: Flags, Ratings, and Color Labels
Having all the various view modes and their associated tools at your disposal
won’t do you a lick of good if you can’t integrate them into your workflow in a
way that makes the process of evaluating your photos more efficient. I’ve come
up with my workflow model, but don’t think of it as carved in stone. Perhaps
you already have a system of, say, color labels or ratings that works for you. By
all means, do what works. In these next few sections, I cover what organiza-
tional tools are available to you and how they work in a typical Lightroom
workflow. Feel free to pick and choose the pieces that fit your needs.
Using flags to pick the winners from the losers
Flags are a fantastic tool for quickly making a first-pass edit of your photos so
that you can separate the shots you want to keep from the ones that no one
else needs to see. You have three flag states to choose from, represented by
the flag icons shown in Figure 6-9:
 Pick: These are your keepers, and are marked with a White Flag icon.
 Rejected: These are on the chopping block, and are marked with a Black
Flag icon.
 Unflagged: These haven’t been evaluated, and do not show an icon.
119
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

120
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Figure 6-9: Three photos showing picked, rejected, and unflagged photos from left to right.
Flags (of each type) can be applied to one or more selected photos at a time.
Unflagged photos do not show a flag, but if you position your cursor over an
unflagged photo, you can see the outline of the flag icon. This clickable target
can be used to set a flag. Click the icon once to set it as picked and click
again to unflag. You can also apply flags by
 Clicking either the Pick or Rejected Flag icon on the Toolbar.
 Right-clicking (Control+click on a Mac) a photo and choosing Set Flag
and then choosing one of the three flag states from the contextual
menu that appears.
 Keyboard shortcuts — P for Pick, X for Rejected, and U for Unflagged.
 Choosing Photo➪Set Flag from the main menu.
Flags don’t tag along with photos when you put them into a collection. In
other words, if you apply a Pick flag to a given photo and move it to a collec-
tion, you see that its flag did not come with it. The intention is to allow
greater flexibility with how you might use flags, but I’ve found that most
people just consider it confusing — and I agree. 
The easiest and most efficient method to apply flags is by using the keyboard
shortcuts. This process is expedited by choosing Photo➪Auto Advance from
the main menu. With this feature enabled, Lightroom automatically advances
to the next photo after applying the flag.
Here’s a real quick workflow using the Filter bar (which I’ll cover in more
detail later) for making your first-round selections:
1. Press G to jump to Grid view.
2. Press Shift+Tab to hide all panels and maximize content area.

3. Adjust the Thumbnail Size slider on the Toolbar as needed to get a
good size for evaluating each photo.
When you need to quickly see a 1:1 view of your photo while working in
Grid view, press and hold the Z key to zoom. While holding the Z key,
you can even click and drag the photo to inspect other areas. When you
release the Z key, you return directly to Grid view.
4. On the Filter bar, click the Attribute label to display the Attribute fil-
ters, and then right-click (Control+click on a Mac) anywhere on the
flag icons in the Attribute filter and choose Flagged and Unflagged
Photos from the contextual menu that appears (refer to Figure 6-10).
Figure 6-10: The Filter bar showing the Attribute filters.
This sets a view filter (more on the Filter bar at the end of the chapter)
that tells Lightroom to only display photos that are either flagged as a
Pick or Unflagged, which results in Lightroom hiding (not deleting) any
photos that are flagged as Rejected. This way, when you flag a photo as
Rejected, it immediately vanishes from view and advances you to the
next photo (don’t worry though; you can bring it back later).
5. Choose Photo➪Auto Advance from the main menu.
You can also enable Auto Advance by pressing Caps Lock before flag-
ging, but the advantage of using the Auto Advance menu is that you
don’t have to worry about turning Caps Lock off before you start typing
somewhere else.

Part II: Managing Your Photos 
6. With the first image selected, evaluate and flag as either a Pick or
Rejected.
Press P for Pick and X for Rejected. Lightroom automatically advances
to the next thumbnail. If you just can’t decide, press U (Unflagged) to
advance to the next photo. I show you how to deal with unflagged
photos later.
7. Continue applying flags until you reach the last image.
At this point, you should only see photos that are flagged as Pick or
Unflagged. Skip to Step 10 if you didn’t leave any photos Unflagged.
8. On the Filter bar, right-click (Control+click on a Mac) anywhere on the
flag icons and choose Unflagged Photos Only.
Now, all picks and rejected photos are hidden from view, and you are left
with only unflagged photos.
9. Flag the remaining photos as either a Pick or Rejected.
When photos are flagged, they’re hidden from view because of the
Unflagged Photos Only filter. You know you’re finished when you don’t
have any photos left.
10. On the Filter bar, right-click (Control+click on a Mac) anywhere on the
flag icons and choose Rejected Photos Only.
Photos flagged as rejected are going to appear faded; this is normal and
helps them to stand out when you see a mix of flag states.
11. Verify that you’re satisfied with your Rejected photos and change any
to Pick if needed.
12. Press Ctrl+Backspace (Ô+Delete on a Mac) and choose Delete from
Disk.
This is the keyboard shortcut to delete rejected photos — you find the
same command under the Photo menu.
13. Press Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac) to turn off all filters.
You should now be left with all the photos you flagged as Pick!
Deleting photos from Lightroom
Lightroom is very careful (as it
should be) in its approach to delet-
ing photos from disk. You’re always
prompted with a confirmation dialog
box, as shown in Figure 6-11, before
a deletion is allowed to take place.
When prompted, click the Delete
from Disk button to complete the
Figure 6-11: The Confirm dialog box appears
when attempting to delete photos.

deletion process and have Lightroom move the selected photo(s) to the
Recycle Bin (Trash on a Mac). Clicking Remove removes the photo from the
Lightroom catalog only.
You can only delete a photo from disk with the Delete key when you’re work-
ing in a Folder view. If you’re working in a Collection view and press Delete,
the selected photo(s) are removed from that collection only. (For more on
Folder views and Collection views, check out Chapter 5.)
Using ratings to rank images
Ratings provide another means to sort your photos by subjective criteria.
There’s no hard-and-fast rule on what criteria correlates to any number of
star ratings. It’s entirely up to you to develop your system! Because I use a
flag system to cull all the bloopers first, I don’t use ratings to mark which
photos stay or go. I find ratings helpful for quickly identifying the best of the
best, while ignoring the photos that aren’t so bad to warrant deletion but at
the same time, just aren’t good enough to do much with.
In the interest of keeping things simple, the more I like a shot, the more stars
I apply. To prevent a lot of hemming and hawing over the difference between
a 4-star photo and a 5-star photo, I typically use a 0–2 star scale. If I think it’s
a useable shot, I assign one star; if I think it’s really good, I assign 2 stars; and
if I can’t decide, I leave it at 0. I find this helps me refine and focus my energy
on processing instead of ranking. Develop a system that works for you.
As with most Lightroom tasks, there’s more than one approach to accom-
plishing the same result. After selecting the photo, you can apply ratings in
the following ways:
 Press the number keys, 0–5, depending on the number of stars you want
to apply. Each number key corresponds to the number of stars applied.
 Click the appropriate star under each photo cell in Grid view. Press J
to cycle through Grid cell styles if you don’t see rating stars under the
thumbnails.
 Right-click (Control+click on a Mac), select Set Rating from the contex-
tual menu that appears, and then choose your desired rating from the
menu.
 Choose Photo➪Set Rating from the main menu and then choose your
desired rating from the menu.
After you apply a rating and still have the photo(s) selected, you can use the
[ key to decrease or the ] key to increase the rating. When it comes to apply-
ing ratings, I find it goes quicker when you enable automatic advancing
(Photo➪Auto Advance) and then use the number keys to move through an
entire shoot.

Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Applying color labels to differentiate images
Color labels provide a visual that you can use to further sort and organize
your photos. How these are used is entirely subjective, and perhaps you
might not use them at all. They do offer some unique benefits:
 Labels are very flexible.
 Labels can be shared between Lightroom and Adobe Bridge (the file
browser bundled with Photoshop).
 Labels can be used as criteria in the creation of smart collections.
 Labels can be used as a filter on the Filter bar.
I’ve seen people use labels to assign a different color to each photographer
for easier sorting after an event with multiple shooters. I’ve seen others
assign different colors to different states in the editing process (such as a
color for Needs Keywords, another for Ready to Deliver, and so on).
I find labels useful for labeling groups of photos that I intend to send to other
applications for additional processing. For example, I have a color for photos
I plan to stitch into a panorama, another color for photos I want to combine
into a high dynamic range photo, and so on. I then set up a smart collection
for each color label to provide quick access to these special groupings.
Instead of trying to remember what each color means in your system, you
can create a Custom Label Set with names that make sense to you. Here’s
how to create your custom label set:
1. Chooose Metadata➪Color
Label Set➪Edit from the main
menu.
Doing so launches the Edit
Color Label Set dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-12.
2. Enter a name for each color in
the set that you want to use.
In my example, I used
Panoramic for red, HDR for
yellow, and so on.
3. Choose Save Current Settings
as New Preset from the Preset
drop-down menu.
The New Preset dialog box appears.
Figure 6-12: The Edit Color Label Set dialog
box.

4. Enter a name and click Create.
The preset name appears in the Preset drop-down menu of the Edit
Color Label Set dialog box.
5. Click Change to close the editor and begin using that set.
You can use only one color label set at a time, so when you change to this
new set, you won’t see any color labels applied with a previous color set.
A color label is simply a tag in the file’s metadata. By applying a color label,
you’re entering the color label into the file’s metadata. When that label
matches the color label set in use, Lightroom displays the corresponding
color. Changing the set doesn’t change the label that’s applied; you just won’t
see Lightroom display a color. You can change color label sets by selecting
them from the Metadata➪Color Label Set menu.
If you use Adobe Bridge in conjunction with Lightroom, you might want to
create the same color label set in Bridge so that both applications use labels
the same way.
Moving Beyond Camera-Generated
Filenames and Metadata
With every shutter click your digital camera creates a file, assigns it a name,
and embeds all the settings used to make the capture into the file’s metadata
space. When you begin to work with your photos, you want to add additional
custom metadata (such as your contact information) to your files. When
doing so, you might discover that the camera-generated filenames don’t
particularly fit your needs. Lightroom has an excellent set of tools to aid
you in managing this aspect of your portfolio.
It’s possible to both rename and apply custom metadata during the Import
process. However, that doesn’t fit everyone’s workflow. For some, the Import
process is just getting photos off the memory card as quickly as possible,
and everything else can come later. For others, it only makes sense to apply
a minimal amount of custom metadata at import and then complete the job
after the first round of edits, so that time isn’t wasted working on files des-
tined for the trash heap. Similarly, you might want to wait to rename all
photos until after you remove the duds so you don’t end up with any gaps in
the filenames. Whatever your reason or workflow, Lightroom allows for a flex-
ible approach.
125
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

Part II: Managing Your Photos 
Batch renaming with filename templates
After you import your photos to Lightroom, it’s in your best interest to per-
form all your renaming tasks from within Lightroom because Lightroom
stores each file’s name in its catalog. If you were to rename files outside of
Lightroom, the data in Lightroom’s catalog wouldn’t match the new names,
and Lightroom then would consider those files missing or offline. While it is
possible to reconnect Lightroom to the newly named files, it’s an onerous
task that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen
people do this. Please don’t fall into that trap!
Thankfully, the renaming function within Lightroom is powerful, extremely
configurable, and easy to use. Lightroom comes installed with a number of
file-naming templates that you can use as-is, or you can create custom tem-
plates to fit your needs. Each file-naming template is comprised of tokens —
little widgets that represent a chunk of data used to build your filename.
These tokens include
 Custom text
 Date/time values
 Sequence numbers
 Metadata elements
 Existing filename
These tokens are assembled and arranged with Lightroom’s Filename
Template Editor, which is best explained by walking through an example.
Here’s how to create a custom naming template comprised of the capture
date and a sequence number:
1. Select the photos you want to
rename from Grid view.
2. Choose Library➪Rename
Photo from the main menu (or
press F2).
The Rename Photos dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 6-13.
3. Choose Edit from the File Naming drop-down menu.
Doing so launches the Filename Template Editor shown in Figure 6-14.
4. Select and delete any existing tokens from the Editor window.
The active template always appears in the editor. You can use the exist-
ing tokens as a starting place for a new template, but I usually find it
simpler to start from scratch. That said, if you want to see how other
templates are constructed, you could click the Preset drop-down menu
and select other templates to load into the Editor window.
Figure 6-13: The Rename Photos dialog box.

Figure 6-14: The Filename Template Editor.
5. Choose the desired date format token from the Date drop-down menu.
Personally, I’d go for Date (YYYYMMDD), but you can mix and match
any configuration of date elements that best suits your needs. Note:
When selecting an item from the drop-down menu, you don’t need to
click the Insert button; the token is added to the template automatically.
You only need to click the Insert button if the element you want to use is
the default menu item showing.
6. Click the Editor window after the date token and type an underscore.
Yes, you can hard-code text right into your template! It’s a filename after
all, so don’t go crazy, but if there’s some naming convention you want in
a template you can either hard-code it by typing it or add a custom text
token for greater flexibility. I use an underscore because I don’t believe
in having spaces in filenames.
7. Choose the desired sequence format from the Sequence drop-down
menu.
I often work with a three-digit sequence number, so I chose the Sequence
# (001) token.
127

8. Choose Save Current Settings as New Preset from the Preset drop-
down menu.
Doing so opens the New Preset dialog box. Custom file-naming templates
are going to be available to you during import, export, and as part of the
Rename Photos dialog box regardless of where the templates are cre-
ated, so it makes good sense to save them for reuse.
9. Enter a descriptive name in the Preset Name field and then click
Create.
In the Filename Template Editor, the name you chose appears in the
Preset drop-down menu.
10. Click Done to return to the Rename Photos dialog box.
The name of the template you created appears in the dialog box’s File
Naming drop-down menu and the example at the bottom left of the
dialog box reflects your new template.
11. Click OK to apply that template to the selected photos.
Keep in mind that renaming photos in Lightroom renames the actual
photos, too.
Creating metadata templates to embed
information into each image
The Metadata panel (see Figure 6-15)
is great for displaying any metadata
embedded in an image, but you can
also use it to add new metadata, edit
some existing metadata, or access
other photos that share common
data points. Because so much data
about each photo can be displayed,
the Metadata panel has a number of
different view options that are acces-
sible via the drop-down menu in the
panel’s header. This enables you to
pick a view that shows only the type
of metadata you’re interested in,
which makes work much easier.
The Preset drop-down menu at the
top of the panel gives you access to
your custom metadata templates —
as well as the controls to create new

templates. Any templates you’ve created via the Import dialog box are also
accessible here. To create a new metadata template
1. Choose Edit Presets from the Preset drop-down menu. 
The Edit Metadata Presets dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-16.
You can also access this dialog box by choosing Metadata➪Edit Metadata
Presets from the main menu.
Figure 6-16: The Edit Metadata Presets dialog box.
2. Complete all applicable fields.
Depending on your needs, you can complete as much or as little of the
dialog box before saving it as a template.
3. Choose Save Current Settings as New Preset from the Preset drop-
down menu.
Doing so launches the New Preset dialog box.

4. Enter a name in the Preset Name field and click Create.
The name of the preset appears in the editor’s Preset drop-down menu.
5. Click Done to close the editor.
You can apply a preset by selecting
your photos in Grid view, and then
selecting the desired preset from the
Metadata panel’s Preset drop-down
menu. Lightroom prompts you with
the Apply Metadata Preset dialog
box, shown in Figure 6-17, where you
can choose to apply the preset to just
the active photo or to all selected
photos. Select the Don’t Show Again
check box if you don’t want to be prompted in the future. (The choice you
make becomes the default behavior when the prompt is turned off.) 
Keywording
I don’t know anyone who loves the task of adding keywords to their photos,
but I also don’t know anyone who isn’t glad to have well-keyworded photos
when it comes time to find them. Keywording is your chance to describe the
contents of your photos with words that aid you in finding them. By doing so,
the words you use form a structure of their own inside your catalog. If you’re
thorough and consistent in the application of keywords, you’ll reach a point
where you can find all photos of a given subject with just a click (or two).
Although it’s possible (and often helpful) to start keywording at import, you’ll
find the Library module is where you do most of your keywording activities.
Both the Keywording panel and the Keyword List panel have supporting roles
in this process.
If you weren’t a user of Lightroom 1, then you can skip this paragraph
because I just want to bring former Lightroom users up to speed on an inter-
face change. The Keyword Tags panel of Lightroom 1 has moved from the left
side of the interface to the right side, and is renamed Keyword List. The
Keywording panel remains on the right side with the same name.
The Keywording panel, shown in Figure 6-18, is made of three sections:
 Keyword Tags: The top section of the panel, Keyword Tags, provides a
means to enter new keywords and to display the applied keywords of a
selected photo. Use the Keyword Tags drop-down menu to access other
options for displaying keywords.
Figure 6-17: The Apply Metadata Preset dialog
box.

 Keyword Suggestions: While
you add keywords to your
photos, Lightroom begins gen-
erating a list of suggested key-
words based on other photos
that have similar keywords
applied to them. This is a new
addition to Lightroom 2, and
not only speeds up the key-
wording process, but also helps
you remain consistent. Click
any suggested keyword to add it
to the selected photo.
 Keyword Set: Another keyword
entry aid. You can create an
unlimited number of keyword
sets of up to nine keywords in
each. Lightroom comes
installed with three common
sets that you can use or modify
to fit your needs. Holding the
Alt key (Option key on a Mac)
reveals the keyboard shortcuts
for each word in the set. This
makes for speedy keywording
by selecting photos and press-
ing Alt+number. Use the
Keyword Set drop-down menu
to access an existing set, or
choose Edit Set to create a
new one.
The Keyword List panel, shown in Figure 6-19, consists of the following items:
 Add/Remove keywords buttons: Click the + or – buttons in the Keyword
List header to add or remove keywords.
 Filter Keywords: Your keyword list can grow quite large. Enter a word
(or part of a word) in the Filter Keywords field to display the keywords
containing only that word (or part of that word).
 The master list of keywords.

Adding and organizing keywords
You can add keywords to selected photos in the Library module a number
of ways:
 Drag selected photos onto a keyword in the Keyword List panel. 
 Drag selected keywords onto selected photos.
 Select photo(s) and enter keywords via the Keywording panel.
 Use keyword shortcuts.
You can’t say Lightroom doesn’t give you choices! Just to narrow down the
realm of possibilities, though, I walk you through one way — creating and
applying a keyword in the same step:
1. Select a photo to keyword from Grid view.
In this example, I use a photo of my dog, Niko (see Figure 6-20).
2. Expand the Keywording panel and then click the Click Here to Add
Keywords field.
Always use this field to add new keywords.

Figure 6-20: Applying keywords to a photo using the Keywording panel.
3. Enter a keyword and press Enter.
In this example, I simply enter dog and press Enter.
At its most basic level, that’s all there
is to it. The keyword dog has been
applied to the photo, and the key-
word now appears in the Keyword
List panel. If I have another dog
photo, I can drag the photo onto the
keyword (or vice versa) to apply the
keyword to the photo. Alternatively,
if I prefer to type the keyword, I can
repeat the steps above; however, as
soon as I type d, Lightroom kicks into
auto-complete mode and displays
possibilities from my keyword list
that I can then choose from, as
shown in Figure 6-21.
You can assign multiple keywords to
selected photos by entering them
into the Click Here to Add Keywords
field, separating each word with a
comma. For example, I could also
type pets, baseball, Niko and then
press Enter. As more keywords are
added to each photo, they appear in
the Keyword List panel.
133
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library
Figure 6-21: Keyword auto complete example.

134
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
As you can imagine, the Keyword List panel keeps growing as each new word
is added, so much so that, pretty soon, it becomes rather unwieldy. To maxi-
mize the effectiveness of your keywords, you might want to consider arrang-
ing them into a hierarchical structure that adds both additional meaning and
organization to your keyword list.
To put your existing keywords into
some kind of order, you can drag and
drop keywords onto each other,
which puts them into a parent/child
relationship. For example, I originally
added baseball, dog, pets, and Niko
to the photo back in Figure 6-20. If I
want to start building a structure
with those words, I’d probably select
dog in the Keyword List panel and
drag it to pets. (I’m such a logical
guy.) After releasing dog, it’s nested
under pets, as shown in Figure 6-22.
Instead of creating your structure
after you add words to your photos,
you can reverse the process and
create the structure first. This gives
you the benefit of thinking about
how you want to arrange your key-
words beforehand and generally
leads to a much more thorough key-
wording process. The Keyword List panel provides the tools to aid you in the
creation of new keywords. For example, to continue building on the “pets”
structure I want to add the keyword cat and nest it underneath pets in antici-
pation of future cat photos. Here’s how:
1. Select the parent keyword.
In this case, I select pets
because I want to add cat as a
child keyword.
2. Click the + symbol at the top of
the Keyword panel to open the
Create Keyword Tag dialog box
shown in Figure 6-23.
3. Enter the keyword in the
Keyword Tag field.
Figure 6-22: Nested keyword structure.
Figure 6-23: The Create Keyword Tag dialog
box.

4. Enter any synonyms.
Separate each synonym with a comma. Synonyms aren’t searchable inside
Lightroom, but they can be included as a keyword in exported copies.
5. Check the Put Inside box.
6. Uncheck the Add to Selected Photos box.
In this case, I’m adding a keyword in anticipation of a future photo, not
adding a keyword to any photos I have selected, so I uncheck this
option. Of course, you can leave it checked if you want to apply it as
part of the process.
7. Check the Include on Export box.
If you want this keyword included in the exported copies, you need to
check this box. If you just want the keyword to exist as an organizational
aid in your catalog (such as a high-level category heading), then leave
this box unchecked.
8. Check the Export Containing Keywords box.
The parent keyword will also export. In this case, I want to ensure pets
exports as a keyword along with cat.
9. Check the Export Synonyms box.
10. Click Create.
My new keyword, cat, is now added to the Keyword List panel under pets. The
process is the same for adding other new keywords while you flesh out a key-
word structure.
Using the Keyword List to find photos
Now that you’ve added a few keywords and have begun creating an organiza-
tional structure, you can use the Keyword List panel to jump right to a group
of photos that share the same keyword. Figure 6-24 shows my first dog photo
selected and both the Keywording and Keyword List panels. Notice that the
four keywords in the Keyword Tags field have check marks next to them in
the Keyword List. Those check marks identify all the keywords applied to the
selected photo. Also, notice that the cursor is hovering over the Dog keyword
in the list. I want you to know about two important options:
 The Check Mark inside a Box business. When you move your cursor
over any keyword, you see a check box appear. Unchecking a keyword
removes it from the selected photo. Adding a check mark applies that
keyword to the selected photo.
135
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

136
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
 The Right-facing Arrow next to the Counter business. Clicking that
arrow applies a Library filter that displays only the photos in the catalog
that have that same keyword. Click None on the Filter bar to turn the
filter off.
Figure 6-24: The Keywording and Keyword List panels.
Before I wrap up this chapter with a look at the Filter bar there is one more
cool tool I want to introduce you to that will make adding all these various
types of flags, metadata, and keywords a lot more fun.
Using the Painter Tool 
The Painter tool is the little spray can icon in the Grid view Toolbar, as shown
in Figure 6-25. You can use it to apply keywords, labels, flags, ratings, metadata,
develop settings (the same Develop presets you saw in the Quick Develop
panel), or photo rotations. You can even use it to assign a photo to a specific
collection. It’s quite simple to use if you prefer a more hands-on approach to
adding the same piece of information to a large group of photos. 
Here’s the basic process — it’s going to work the same for each data type:
Figure 6-25: The Painter tool in the Toolbar.
Painter tool

1. Click the Painter tool to activate it.
Your cursor changes to the Painter icon and the Toolbar now shows
only the Painter-specific settings.
2. Choose the type of data you want to apply from the Paint drop-down
menu.
In Figure 6-26, you can see I selected Rating. Whichever option you
choose from the Paint menu results in its available options being dis-
played as the next setting to configure (in my case, stars appeared).
Figure 6-26: The Painter tool options.
3. Choose the actual data you want to apply to your photos.
What you choose here will depend on the type of data you selected in
the Paint drop-down menu. In my example I chose a rating of 2 stars. If
keywords were chosen from the menu then I would type in keywords
and so on. Think of this as loading the paint can with actual paint you
are going to spray.
4. Click and drag the Painter tool across the photos you want to apply
that data to.
You apply the chosen information as you move the cursor across each
photo. Just one click and drag (as if you are spraying) across the photos
is all it takes. 
137
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

138
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
If you “overspray” and get paint on the wrong photo, you can remove
that data by clicking that photo with the Painter tool. Actually as soon
as you move the Painter over an already-painted photo, the cursor
changes to an eraser! 
5. Click the Done button in the Toolbar or press Esc to put the Painter
tool away.
Finding Photos with the Filter Bar
Okay, you’ve invested a lot of time in managing your portfolio, so you might
as well take a look at one of the ways you can start to get a return on that
investment. Let me introduce you to the Filter bar, shown in Figure 6-27 — a
new addition to Lightroom. It combines what was the Metadata Browser and
the Find panels in Lightroom 1, but takes those panels to a new level (and a
new location). With the Filter bar embedded in the top of the content area,
it feels much more integrated with the process of finding and filtering your
photos. The downside is that it eats into the content area’s real estate, but
this can be alleviated with the use of a secondary display window set to Grid
view. The Filter bar display can be toggled on and off by pressing the \ key.
This doesn’t turn off any active filter; it just hides the bar to maximize the
content area. Filtering is turned on and off by pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac)
or by clicking None on the Filter bar.
Figure 6-27: The Filter bar.

The Filter bar allows you to drill down into your portfolio in the following ways:
 Searching text fields: Not limited to searching by keyword, you can
search on filenames and metadata fields as well.
 By status indicators: Clicking Refine reveals the options for “refining”
your view using flags, ratings, labels, and master versus virtual copy
status.
 Leveraging metadata: Enabling the metadata filter opens worlds of pos-
sibilities for gathering photos based on information about or embedded
in each file, such as capture date, file type, aspect ratio, shutter speed,
location, camera used, and more!
Filters can be used singly or in multiple mix-and-match combinations. I could
have a hankering, say, for all TIF files with the keyword flower that were taken
with my D200 and that have a rating of three stars or greater. Here’s how I’d
use a filter to satisfy that hankering:
1. Select All Photographs from the Catalog panel.
2. Press \ if the Filter bar isn’t visible.
3. On the Filter bar, click the Text label.
Doing so causes the Filter bar to expand and show the Text filter.
4. Choose Keywords from the Search Target drop-down menu.
You could leave it set to Any Searchable Field because it’s unlikely that
flower would appear anywhere and not be a keyword, but I want to point
out how specific you can focus your searches.
5. Enter flower into the Search field.
When you begin typing, the content area updates to show only those
results that match the filter.
6. Hold the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac) and click the Attribute label.
Doing so causes the Filter bar to expand and show the Attribute filters.
7. Click the third rating star.
Only photos with the flower keyword that are rated three stars or higher
are left in the results.
8. Hold the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac) and click the Metadata label.
The Filter bar expands further to include the Metadata options. The
Default Columns view is displayed, which does include the camera
model, but I also want to limit the results to only TIF files. You can
customize the metadata columns to show different data — would
anyone like to change the Lens column to File Type?
139
Chapter 6: Organizing and Developing from the Library

140
Part II: Managing Your Photos 
9. Choose File Type from the drop-down menu located next to Lens.
I can change any column to File Type, but because Lens isn’t criteria I’m
concerned with in this example, I chose to ditch Lens. Now, I can see the
file types as well as the camera models that represent the photos show-
ing in the content area.
10. Click the TIFF label.
Now, only TIF files are showing.
11. Click the Nikon D200 label.
Now, only TIF files, shot with the D200, rated three stars or higher, that
contain the Flower keyword are showing.
If this was a filter type that I thought I would use often, I could choose Save
Current Settings as New Preset from the Custom Filter drop-down menu and
give my new preset a name. It would then appear in the Custom Filter drop-
down menu and be just a click away. Press Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac) or click
None on the Filter bar to turn off that filter and return to an unfiltered All
Photographs.

hether you’re shooting raw or JPG (or
both), you won’t be able to escape having
to perform some level of digital tweaking of your
photos. Chapter 7 introduces you to the Develop
module and the most common tasks you under-
take when processing your photos.
After you master the basics, you’ll be ready to dig
into the more advanced Develop module tools
covered in Chapter 8. The tips and tricks I high-
light here can help you achieve the vision you
hold for your photos in your mind’s eye. 
Depending on your artistic vision and the
demands of your project, you might also ﬁnd that
you need  an external image editor to complete
the job. Chapter 9 covers all the improved integra-
tion features with Photoshop CS2 and shows you
how to take your photos out of Lightroom and
bring them back in again.

elcome to the Develop module! This is where
Lightroom’s real magic happens. You find some
amazing additions to the Develop toolset in this version
of Lightroom, and some of the existing tools have
been upgraded. The need to send photos to an exter-
nal editor has been decreased significantly. (In fact,
you might no longer need an external editor for
most photos!) Because this module has so much to
offer, I split the coverage of the Develop module
between this chapter and Chapter 8.
In case you are puzzling over the use of the word
develop here, you need to keep in mind that Lightroom
was primarily designed to work with raw photos, which by
definition have not yet been processed for final output. So,
Lightroom approaches photos with the mindset that photos first
need to be developed before they are ready to leave Lightroom and face what-
ever comes next. 

144
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Aside from getting oriented to where everything is in the Develop interface,
you get a chance to focus on the most common Develop tasks (from adjusting
exposure levels to removing red-eye), as well as how to go back in time,
batch process hundreds of images, and save your settings for reuse.
Exploring the Develop Module
At first glance, it’s easy to be a little overwhelmed by all the panels, sliders,
and buttons in this module. Don’t be! The layout is essentially the same as all
the other modules. You find the Module Picker across the top; the left side
holds the panels that pertain to saved settings and different states of your
photos; the right side contains all the adjustment controls. In the center, you
find the content area and the Toolbar, and the ever-present Filmstrip runs
along the bottom. Refer back to Chapter 1 for ways to modify the interface to
suit your needs.
Getting to know the panels and tools
To know the Develop module is to love it, so go ahead and get acquainted
with the interface, shown in Figure 7-1. Here’s an overview of what you can
find lying about:
Figure 7-1: The Develop module interface.

 Identity plate: Also known as the vanity plate, this is a customizable com-
ponent of the interface that you can use to make Lightroom your own.
 Navigator panel: Displays a preview of your presets as you move the
cursor over the contents of the Presets panel.
 Presets panel: On the left side, the Presets panel contains all the prein-
stalled and (soon to be created) custom Develop presets.
 Snapshots panel: A “snapshot” is a means to preserve a specific state in
your editing process. Snapshots are great for creating multiple versions
of a single file and storing them for easy access later.
 History panel: Still on the left, the History panel records a running his-
tory of every tweak and adjustment you make to each photo. This allows
for an unlimited “undo” because you can always step back through the
Develop history to any point in time.
 Copy and Paste buttons: Allow you to copy and paste Develop settings
from one photo to another.
 Filmstrip: Strung across the bottom, the Filmstrip primarily displays
thumbnails of all the photos in the current grouping, but also contains
shortcuts for controlling both the primary and secondary windows,
quick access to other photo groupings, and tools for filtering the active
photo grouping.
 Content area: This is your workspace, which provides a live preview of
the photo you’re working on.
 Toolbar: Just below the content area, the Toolbar contains the buttons
for switching between view modes, along with additional tools available
via the Toolbar drop-down menu for navigating between photos, playing
an “impromptu” slideshow, controlling zoom level, and applying flags,
ratings, and labels.
 Module Picker: At the top right of the interface lies the Module Picker,
which allows for quick movement between various Lightroom modules.
 Histogram panel: Provides a way to visualize your image data through
an interactive graph of the all the tones contained in the active photo.
 Tool Strip: This is the collection of adjustment-tool icons nested under the
histogram. The Crop, Spot Removal, and Red Eye Correction tools were
pulled from their original location on the Toolbar of Lightroom 1 to join
the new Graduated Filter and Adjustment Brush here in the Tool Strip.
 Basic panel: Why basic? Well, you touch these adjustments almost every
time you bring a photo into the Develop module. You need to get these
settings straight (such as White Balance and Exposure) before you can
move on to other tasks.
145
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics

146
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
 Tone Curve panel: This is the best tool for adjusting brightness and
contrast.
 HSL / Color / Grayscale panel: Allows for the tweaking of individual
colors as well as conversion to grayscale.
 Split Toning panel: Provides control over the color in the shadows and
highlights of your photos. This can be used for creative color modifica-
tions or neutralizing existing color casts.
 Detail panel: Contains the tools for increasing sharpening, reducing
noise, and correcting that annoying purple fringe (that is, chromatic
aberration).
 Vignettes panel: This is both a practical correction tool for fixing dark
edges that can appear because of lens configurations and for applying
creative darkening (and brightening) to a photo’s edges.
 Camera Calibration panel: Provides the ability to chose a default profile
for rendering raw photos as well as the means to create your default ren-
dering settings.
Becoming familiar with the menu options
The File, Edit, View, Window, and Help menus remain consistent across all
modules, but the Develop module has a dedicated set of menu options.
Menus are certainly useful for accessing specific functions, but they also
serve to remind you about all the options and their respective keyboard
shortcuts. Over the course of the two Develop module chapters (this chapter
and Chapter 8), I cover all the functions in their context, but here’s an
overview of what you find in the Develop module menus:
 Develop: Contains the commands for creating new snapshots, presets,
and preset folders, erasing the contents of the History panel, applying
new Develop default settings for raw files, and navigating between
photos.
 Photo: This group of commands pertains to stuff you can do to the
active photo, such as adding it to the Quick Collection (or other target),
showing its location, sending it to an external editor, creating virtual
copies, rotating and flipping, applying flags, ratings, or labels, writing
and reading the metadata stored in the photo, and deleting.
 Settings: Provides access to all the commands for copying, pasting,
syncing, and applying Develop settings.
You might find it more efficient in many cases to use the contextual menus
that appear when you right-click (Control+click on a Mac) various panels,
settings, and photos. Don’t be shy — click around and see what you find!

Understanding the view options
Working in the Develop module is obviously a visual process. You can scruti-
nize every nudge of every slider to get your photos looking how you want.
Lightroom offers two view modes (with multiple options) to help you see
what you’re doing and how far you’ve come:
 Loupe view: This is the default working view when you enter the Develop
module, and is where you will do almost all of your work. Just like the
Loupe view in the Library module, you’ll only see one photo at a time in
the content area. You can zoom in or out by clicking the photo, using the
controls in the Navigator panel, or the Zoom slider in the Toolbar. You
can jump to Loupe view in the Develop module by pressing D no matter
where you are in Lightroom.
The word loupe refers to the film-based practice of looking at negatives
through a magnifying lens called a loupe.
 Before and After view: Allows you to switch out of Loupe view for a
comparison between the work you’ve done and the photo you started
with. There are a number of variations on how you can arrange photos
for comparison (which I’ll cover in a bit) to give some choice over which
might work best for a given photo. Press D to switch back to Loupe view.
No matter which view you’re working in, to cycle through the Info Overlay
displays — that little summary of information about the active photo that
displays in the content area — press the I key, or choose View➪Loupe Info
menu. To customize the information shown in the overlay, press Ctrl+J (Ô+J
on a Mac).
Okay, you have the overview out of the way — time to take a closer look at
each view mode.
The Loupe view
Just like in the Library module, the Navigator
panel, shown in Figure 7-2, controls the zoom
level. The default is Fit (the entire photo fits in
the content area), with a zoomed-out level of 1:1
(as in 100 percent, or actual pixel view). You can
change the zoom level by clicking the labels in
the Navigator panel. When zoomed beyond Fit
view, you can pan around the photo by clicking
and dragging in the content area or by clicking
and dragging inside the Navigator preview.
The Before and After views
Although much of your work happens in Loupe
view, sometimes it’s hard to appreciate how far
147
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics
Figure 7-2: The Navigator panel’s
zoom controls.

148
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
you’ve come until you look at where you started. You can compare Before
and After views several ways:
 Left and Right: Choose either a side-by-side view of the whole photo
showing each state, or a split view (shown in Figure 7-3) that shows the
Before image on the left and the After image on the right.
 Top and Bottom: Choose either to have the entire Before image on top
and the After image on the bottom, or a single photo split between the
two views.
 Before Only: This option is great for toggling between Before and After
views for a quick peek by pressing the \ key.
These views aren’t just for looking, though! All the adjustment sliders are still
active and can be applied while looking at the Before and After views. 
You can access all these view options from the button on the Toolbar (or the View
menu). Note: When you’re in Before and After view, three additional icons appear
in the Toolbar. (Refer to Figure 7-3.) Here’s what they do (from left to right):
 Copy Before’s settings to After: If you decide you want to start over, you
can quickly revert your After state’s settings to how they were before.
 Copy After’s settings to Before: If you’re satisfied with the After state,
you can save it as the new Before state so that you can press on with
additional edits and have this state to compare against (and revert to).
 Swap Before and After Settings: This is handy if you want to create a
new version that goes in a different direction from the original Before
state, and preserves the current After state for later comparison.
Figure 7-3: Before and After split view.

These commands are also accessible from the View menu and can be applied
from the Loupe view, too, if needed.
Applying settings to other photos
Okay, I’m sure your itching to dive in to the Editing tools (and you will!), but I
really want you to have the big picture in mind before you start pushing slid-
ers around. I promise you’ll be knee-deep in adjustments soon enough.
I want to call your attention to the two buttons at the bottom of the left panel
group and the two buttons at the bottom of the right panel group. (Again,
refer to Figure 7-3.) Here’s what they do:
 Copy: Allows you to copy settings from the active photo so that they
can be pasted on to other photos (one at a time).
 Paste: Applies the copied settings to only to the active photo when
clicked. For multiple photos, use Sync/Auto Sync, which I cover in a bit.
 Previous: Applies all the settings from the last photo you worked on to
the currently active photo. This button is only visible when you have a
single photo selected in the Filmstrip.
 Reset: Removes all Develop settings.
The Copy/Paste function is great when you want to keep a collection of set-
tings ready to be pasted to any single photo when needed. However, when
you want to apply a collection of settings across a selection of photos, you
need to use either the Sync button, or its alter ego, the Auto Sync button.
If you have more than one photo selected, either in the Filmstrip or if you are
using the secondary window in Grid view, you notice that the Previous
button has changed to Sync. When you click the Sync button, it opens the
Synchronize Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 7-4. This functions just like
the Copy button in that it allows you to choose which settings in the active
photo you want to apply, but in this case, the settings are applied to the
other photos you select. After checking the boxes next to the settings you
want to “sync,” click the Synchronize button.
You can synchronize settings across any number of selected photos, which is
most effective when you want to selectively synchronize a subset of settings
across multiple photos. If you’re in a situation where you have a grouping of
photos that you want to process exactly the same way and in real time
(almost), then you want to change the Sync button to Auto Sync by holding the
Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac) and clicking Sync. As soon as you press that key, you see
Sync change to Auto Sync — clicking the button makes the transformation
149
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics

150
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
complete. After you turn on Auto Sync, every adjustment you make to the
active photo is automatically applied to the rest of the selected photos. You
see the thumbnail previews update as you work. This is a huge timesaver!
Here’s the catch — once Auto Sync is on, it’s on until you turn it off (just click
it again without holding any key). I have to tell you that I’ve accidentally auto-
sync’d a bunch of files more than once. Thankfully, there’s that faithful Undo
shortcut, Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on a Mac)!
Figure 7-4: The Synchronize Settings dialog box.
The Presets, Snapshots, and History Triple Play
Understanding how the Presets, Snapshots, and History panels function
greatly improves your understanding of how all the Develop module settings
are applied.
Lightroom is a metadata editor, which means that every adjustment you make
is recorded as a set of instructions to be applied during some form of output.
You see a live preview of the changes you make, but it’s just that, a preview.
None of the changes actually “happen” until you do something such as
export a copy or print.

The Presets, Snapshots, and History panels allow you to interact with the set
of instructions Lightroom comes up with in some pretty cool ways. The next
few sections fill you in on the details.
Saving time with presets 
The Presets panel, shown in Figure 7-5,
is where you can save a collection of
settings to be reused on other photos.
A small collection of presets is prein-
stalled and listed under the Lightroom
Presets section of the panel. Any new
presets you create (see the next sec-
tion) are going to be stored under the
User Presets section by default, or you
can create new folders to store them.
Creating your own presets
Because a preset is simply a collec-
tion of settings pulled from the active
photo, the first thing you need to do
is apply some adjustments to said
photo. After you take care of that
business, here’s how you save those
adjustments as a new preset:
1. Click the + icon at the top of the
Presets panel.
Doing so launches the New
Develop Preset dialog box shown
in Figure 7-6.
2. Enter a name for your new
preset in the Preset Name field.
3. (Optional) Click the Folder
drop-down menu to choose
where to place the preset.
This step is optional because all presets are placed in the User Presets
folder by default. You only need to change the location if you want them
somewhere else.

Figure 7-6: The New Develop Preset dialog box.
4. Check the box next to each setting you want to include in the preset.
The Check All and Check None buttons at the bottom of the dialog box
can speed the selection process.
5. Click Create.
The new preset appears in the Presets panel within the folder you select.
Move your cursor over any preset to see a preview of its effect in the
Navigator panel.

If you realize you forgot to add a particular setting or made a new adjustment
and want to add it to the preset, just right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the
preset and choose Update with Current Settings from the contextual menu
that appears. This launches the Update Develop Preset dialog box (which is
the spitting image of the New Develop Preset dialog box). Check and uncheck
any settings and click Update. To delete a user preset, right-click
(Control+click on a Mac) the preset in the Presets panel and choose Delete.
Freezing time with snapshots
The Snapshots panel, shown in Figure 7-7, is a way to collect different states
of a photo and store them so you can revisit a state later. Whatever state a
photo is in can be saved as a snapshot. Just click the + icon at the top of the
Snapshots panel, and give the new Snapshots listing a name. Create as many
snapshots as you need.
If you make some additional
tweaks after saving a snapshot and
like that version better, right-click
(Control+click on a Mac) the snap-
shot and choose Update with
Current Settings from the contextual
menu that appears. To remove a
snapshot, just select it and click the
– icon at the top of the panel.
Going back in time with
the History panel
It’s never too late for a do-over in Lightroom. The History panel, shown in
Figure 7-8, records every adjustment and tweak you make in the Develop
module. You can open a photo anytime and step to any earlier point in its
Develop history by clicking an earlier History step. You can even save a
History state as a snapshot by right-clicking (Control+click on a Mac) and
choosing Create Snapshot from the contextual menu that appears.
Enough of the overview, already. Time to look at how you go about “develop-
ing” your photos.

Development Essentials
Lightroom’s Develop module is both an image processor and an image editor.
I’ll tell you where I draw the line, but I’ll be the first to admit that the distinc-
tion has blurred, thanks to Lightroom. When your camera is set to capture in
JPG mode, it takes the raw capture data and processes it by using the in-
camera settings (such as contrast, saturation, and sharpening) to produce a
rendered JPG version of the captured image data. The benefit of shooting JPG
is that you’re using the camera for both capture and processing, which can
certainly be a timesaver. The downside is that the original raw capture data is
lost after the JPG version is created. If you bring that JPG into Lightroom’s
Develop module, you’re not processing the capture data, but rather editing
the rendered image data. Of course, with Lightroom the actual pixels in the
source file are never changed, so technically, only the pixels in exported
copies are edited, but I hope you can see the distinction.
Here’s why it matters. In contrast to JPG, when you shoot raw, you take the
camera out of the processing business. The result is that the camera is pri-
marily a capture device that saves the raw capture data to your memory
card. That raw capture data needs to be processed by some type of raw-
processing software. I’ll assume you’re using Lightroom for that task. When
you bring a raw photo into Lightroom, you take over the image-processing
tasks formerly performed by the camera in the JPG example. You decide how
much contrast, saturation, and sharpening (to name just a few settings) are
going to be applied to create a rendered version of the photo (during output).

The benefit is that you can customize those settings to maximum effect on a
photo-by-photo basis, and you never lose the original capture data! You can
reprocess the raw data any number of ways. The downside is that you need
to add that processing step into your workflow, which takes time.
The reason the line between processing and editing has blurred is that
Lightroom can perform a much wider range of adjustments on your photos
than any camera could dream of performing. Red-eye removal, cropping, and
spot removal used to be tasks that could be done only in a pixel editor (like
Photoshop). With the introduction of the Graduated Filter and Adjustment
Brush in Lightroom 2, the line between processing and editing is almost erased.
That said, the place where the rubber meets the road (as far as each
Lightroom user is concerned) is that when you bring a rendered file (JPG, TIF,
or PSD) into Lightroom, you’re working with processed data. Therefore, all
the adjustments you make in Lightroom are made relative to whatever pro-
cessing decisions have previously been made. When you bring a raw file into
Lightroom, the adjustments are absolute settings — no prior processing has
been done — giving you much more leeway in how you process each photo.
Using the Histogram panel
The Histogram panel, shown in
Figure 7-9, is another way to look at
your photo by displaying it as a
graph of all the tones it contains.
When this information is used in
conjunction with the live view of the
photo in the content area, it greatly
informs the adjustment decisions
you make.
Although the actual graph is the same
as what is shown in the Library
module, the Develop module’s
Histogram panel has a few additional
features:
 It’s interactive: When you move your cursor over the histogram, you
see how each area of the histogram relates to the tonal adjustment slid-
ers in the Basic panel:
• Blacks: The far-left end of the graph showing the darkest shadows.
• Fill Light: The tonal range between the darkest shadows and the
midtones.
155
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics
Figure 7-9: The Histogram panel.

156
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
• Exposure: Covers the midtones to the beginning of the highlights.
• Recovery: The far-right end of the graph showing the brightest
highlights.
Similarly, if you place your cursor over each of the four tonal adjustment
sliders in the Basic panel, you see the respective sections of the
Histogram panel brighten. You can click and drag within the histogram
to make tonal adjustments, and when you do so, the respective sliders
adjust in tandem.
 It has clipping indicators: The arrows at either end of the histogram are
white when data in all three channels has been clipped, or are a color when
only one or two channels are clipped. (Clipping means that pixels in the
image have exceeded the tonal range on an end of the histogram — shadows
or highlights — and no longer contain any image data.) In some instances,
this is okay, such as shadow aeas you want to be all black, or bright high-
lights — reflections of the sun or chrome, for example, or the catch lights in
someone’s eyes. However, other times, clipping isn’t nice at all — such as
when all the detail in a white wedding dress is lost due to overexposure.
In addition to the histogram indicators, you can enable a visual clipping
indicator that displays in your photo. Press the J key to enable the clip-
ping indicator. When enabled, areas that are clipped on the shadow end
are shown in blue, and areas clipped on the highlights end are shown in
red. Figure 7-10 shows an image with both shadow and highlight clipping.
 It’s great for RGB readouts: The photo you see in the content area is
made from the image data contained in the Red, Green, and Blue chan-
nels of the photo. Lightroom uses a scale that ranges from 0 percent
(black) to 100 percent (white).
Figure 7-10: An example of shadow and highlight clipping indicators.

The relationships between the histogram, the basic tonal adjustments, the
clipping indicators, and the RGB readouts make the histogram an important
tool for evaluating what’s happening in your photos, which is why the
Histogram panel remains visible at the top of the right panel group no matter
how far down you scroll to the other adjustment panels.
Making basic adjustments
It’s almost a given that you’re going
to be making certain kinds of adjust-
ments to almost all your photos.
These adjustments are grouped into
four sections in the Basic panel, as
shown in Figure 7-11:
 Treatment: Choose between
working on a color or grayscale
photo. All the controls in the
Basic panel apply to grayscale
images as well. I cover grayscale
conversions in the next chapter.
 White Balance: Provides tools
you can use to neutralize color
casts or to creatively interpret
the lighting conditions that
existed at the moment of cap-
ture. White balance is subjec-
tive. Have fun with it.
 Tone: Contains the controls for
adjusting the range of tones in
the photo. You can set highlight
and shadow-clipping levels and
adjust midtone brightness
levels as well.
 Presence: These three controls
have a big effect on how people
respond to your photo. The
Clarity slider is essentially a
local contrast adjustment
(which can improve apparent
depth and sharpness), whereas
Vibrance and Saturation adjust
the colors. I go over each in
more detail a little further on.
With that overview in mind, make your way through the next few sections
where I delve deeper into the Basic panel.
157
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Controlling color casts
White balance adjustments — where you attempt to make objects that
appeared white when you saw them in person appear white in the finished
photo — are subjective. How you process your photos is how you express
your vision of the scene that you captured. The color of the light has a big
impact on how others will react to the image. I had a conversation recently
with an extremely successful wedding photographer. He was lamenting the
fact that too many assistants are trained to neutralize the color casts in the
photos they’re editing. He wanted to capture the feeling of the light that was
present at the time of capture, so the photos matched memories of those
moments. Of course, others are sure to prefer that color casts be neutralized.
The choice you make is going to depend on your vision.
Lightroom offers three methods for adjusting the white balance:
 White Balance Selector tool: This neutralizing tool is located in the White
Balance section of the Basic panel. You can activate it by pressing W or by
clicking the eyedropper icon. Your goal is to find and select a highlight
that is close to being neutral; that is, all three RGB values should be
pretty close to each other. The Selector tool has a special Loupe — the
gridlike object behind the cursor shown in Figure 7-12 — that shows you
the pixels and their RGB values under the tool while you move the eye-
dropper to find the right spot to click. RGB values in the 80s usually
work best. Lightroom attempts to neutralize the color cast by adjusting
the R, G, and B channels at that location to equal values.
When active, the Toolbar contains the following options, as shown in
Figure 7-12:
• Auto Dismiss: By default, the White Balance Selector tool goes away
after clicking on a spot. However, at times, you might want to try
sampling multiple locations before manually dismissing the tool.
Uncheck this box to stop Auto Dismiss.
• Show Loupe: The Loupe is a helpful tool, but you can also see the
RGB values display under the histogram. Uncheck this box to turn
off the Loupe.
• Scale: Adjusts the size of the grid in the Loupe.
• Done: Exits the White Balance Tool when not using Auto Dismiss.
Pressing Esc also works.
 White balance preset: When working with raw images, you can set the
absolute white balance based on the lighting at the time of capture using
the appropriate preset, or choose Auto to let Lightroom work its magic.
The absolute white balance value has already been set in rendered files
(JPG, TIF, or PSD), so your preset options in Lightroom are limited to

either leaving it as is (As Shot) or letting Lightroom try to adjust auto-
matically (Auto). Custom is displayed if the White Balance Selector tool
or the Temp and Tint sliders are used to make a manual adjustment with
both raw and rendered files.
 Temperature and Tint sliders: Make manual adjustments to the color
temperature and its tint.
Figure 7-12: The White Balance Selector tool.
I often find that a combination of each of these tools provides me with the
most pleasing results. Your starting point is always going to be the As Shot
setting, and if that looks good to you, then don’t feel compelled to continue
adjusting. When it doesn’t feel right, you need to make some decisions. My
preference is to reach for the White Balance Selector tool and attempt to
achieve a neutral result, and then, based on the scene, adjust the Temp and
Tint sliders until it looks how I think it should. When I’m working on one
photo that’s part of a series shot under the same lighting conditions, I’ll use
the Sync button to apply the same setting to those photos as well.
After you settle on a white balance setting that you like, you can move on to
making tonal adjustments.
Adjusting tonal range to bring out the best
The tone adjustments in the Basic panel provide you creative freedom to
make the most of the settings you used in the camera to capture the image
data. I talk about the relationship between the tonal adjustments and the his-
togram earlier in this chapter, and now you’re going to utilize all the tools at
your disposal.
159
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics

160
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
The Tone section of the Basic panel (refer to Figure 7-11) contains the follow-
ing adjustments:
 Auto: The Auto setting got a complete overhaul for Lightroom 2 and
actually works quite well for many photos. This is Lightroom’s attempt
to optimize the tonal settings based on the data in the histogram. It can
make for a great starting point.
 Exposure: The slider’s scale is based on f-stops. Adjustments will affect
the entire tonal range, but the biggest impact is on the highlights. Adjust
as needed to improve overall image brightness. If some highlight clip-
ping occurs, it might be possible to correct with the Recovery slider.
 Recovery: Use this adjustment to recover detail in extreme highlights by
reducing highlight values until they no longer extend past the end of the
histogram.
 Fill Light: Helps to open detail in the light shadow areas with minimal
impact on the darkest values (to help keep blacks black).
 Blacks: The darkest shadows. Use this slider to determine what areas of
the image (if any) to clip to all black (no detail).
 Brightness: This adjustment acts very much like the Exposure adjust-
ment I mention above, but is primarily intended to brighten midtone
values. It can be helpful in small doses, but you might get better results
from adjusting the tone curve (which I cover in Chapter 8).
 Contrast: Increases or decreases contrast in the image. This is a bit of a
legacy adjustment whose functionality has largely been replaced by the
tone curve.
How you approach these adjustments largely depends on how well the image
was exposed in-camera. Are you compensating for over- or underexposure or
just optimizing a proper exposure? Does the scene contain really bright high-
lights as well as dark shadows? This is where you need to make an evaluation
based on what you see in the content area (in conjunction with the his-
togram) to decide how to get from where you are to where you want to be.
Here’s a basic workflow you can apply to each photo:
1. Evaluate the image.
Note problem areas, such as clipped highlights, clipped shadows, and
muddy midtones. Compare them to how you intended the photo to look.
Can you get there from here?
2. Click Auto in the Tone section.
This function has improved so much that I now include it as a Develop
preset on import because it can serve as a good starting point.
3. (Optional) Press J to turn on the clipping indicators.
They’re easy to toggle on and off and they show you exactly what area of
the photo is being clipped.

4. Adjust the Exposure slider.
Your goal is to set the white point and thereby overall image brightness.
Additionally, you can hold the Alt key (Option on a Mac) while you drag
the Exposure slider to get an alternative view of any image areas that
might be clipping in the highlights.
5. Adjust the Blacks slider.
You always have much less detail in the shadow areas than in the high-
lights. In many cases, you can create a more-pleasing image by clipping
the darkest shadow areas to black. As you can with the Exposure slider,
you can hold the Alt key (Option on a Mac) while dragging the Blacks
slider to see just the areas of the image that are clipping to black.
6. (Optional) Adjust the Recovery slider.
Not every image will need to have the highlights pulled back, but for
those that do, the Recovery slider is a fantastic tool. Adjust as needed
until there is no longer any clipping in the highlights.
7. Adjust the Fill Light slider to brighten the darker areas of the photo.
Almost all images can benefit from a little bump in the Fill Light to open
up shadows a little more.
A quick way to return any slider to its original state is to double-click its
label. This works for all sliders in Lightroom.
I left out the Brightness and Contrast sliders from that process because I tend
to leave them as a “finishing touch” at the end of my developing process, and
I prefer the control offered by the Tone Curve panel. There’s no one right way
to approach this, so if you prefer using the Brightness and Contrasts sliders,
by all means, do so.
Making images pop
Every image won’t need the adjustments found in the Presence section, but
they make a big impact on the ones that do. However, precisely because they
can have such a big impact, you need to be careful not to overdo it. It’s easy
to get hooked on their power!
With that warning out of the way, take another look at Figure 7-11, casting
your eyes to the three sliders in the Presence section of the Basic panel:
 Clarity: This contrast adjustment is designed to give the image a little
oomph. When it was in development, Adobe considered naming it
“punch” because that seemed an apt description of its effect. This adjust-
ment is best applied while zoomed to 1:1 to better gauge its affect on the
detail in the image. Like most things in life it is best used in moderation. 
161
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics

162
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
 Vibrance: A more sophisticated saturation adjustment that mostly
affects the less-saturated colors while protecting skin tones and prevent-
ing clipping in the most-saturated colors. This is a great all-around color
booster.
 Saturation: Use this slider to adjust the saturation of all colors equally in
both directions. Decrease saturation by dragging to the left and increase
saturation by dragging to the right. Not great for skin tones.
A great starting point for Presence settings is contained in the preinstalled
Develop preset called General - Punch. Expand the Presets panel and look
under the Lightroom Presets collection (refer to Figure 7-5). Just click it one
time to apply it to the selected photo. All it does is set Clarity to +50 and
Vibrance to +25. It really does live up to its name!
Fixing Common Problems
Just below the Histogram panel is a collection of editing tools referred to as
the Tool Strip, as shown in Figure 7-13. If you’re familiar with Lightroom 1,
you’ll recognize a few of the tools (although they were previously located in
the Toolbar), but a couple of new additions are here as well. The Tool Strip
contains:
 Crop Overlay: Allows for cropping to a specific aspect ratio; it also func-
tions as a straightening tool.
 Spot Removal: Functions similarly to the Clone and Heal tools in
Photoshop, which primarily allow for the basic removal of sensor spots
and skin blemishes by borrowing pixels from another part of the image.
 Red-Eye Correction: Handy for
those times when you just had
to use on-camera flash.
 Graduated Filter: Enables the
application of multiple adjust-
ment settings in a user-controlled gradual fade across any area of the
photo. For example, you can correct an overcast sky by applying a grad-
ual exposure compensation and saturation boost to just the sky and
having it fade naturally at the horizon.
 Adjustment Brush: Provides the ability to “paint” with multiple adjust-
ment settings. Think of it as a Dodge and Burn tool on steroids! A good
example is the application of additional sharpening to the eyes in a por-
trait without sharpening the surrounding skin, but that just scratches
the surface of what this tool can do.
Need some practical tips on how to use all these tools? Read on and become
enlightened.
Figure 7-13: The Tool Strip.

Creating strong compositions through cropping
Cropping in-camera might be the goal, but it isn’t always the reality. However,
even if you do get it “right” in-camera, there might still be occasions where
you need to produce an image with an aspect ratio that is different from the
aspect ratio of the original photo. The only way to change the aspect ratio is
to crop. The Crop Overlay tool provides both a means for practical correc-
tions as well as creative composition adjustments.
It’s worth mentioning that the histogram always reflects the area of the photo
inside the crop rectangle. In some cases, you might want to make cropping
your first adjustment if you aren’t planning to keep some areas of the photo
in the final composition. This way, the histogram can reflect just the data you
are keeping and, therefore, be more accurate when you’re performing basic
tonal adjustments.
You can jump into the Crop Overlay by clicking its icon in the Tool Strip, but I
prefer the keyboard shortcut R because it works in any module. This is espe-
cially handy after applying a crop ratio to a batch of photos via Quick Develop
in the Library module — press R to jump into Crop Overlay to finesse each
photo.
As soon as you press R, the Crop Overlay appears over the photo and the fol-
lowing cropping options appear in the Tool Strip, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 Crop Frame Tool: Click this tool (the icon next to Aspect) to draw free-
form cropping rectangles as an alternative to readjusting the default
resizing handles.
 Aspect Ratio drop-down menu: Access a list of preinstalled aspect
ratios or create a custom aspect ratio when you need the crop to fit a
determined output aspect ratio.
 Aspect Ratio Lock: When closed, the crop rectangle can be resized, but
the aspect ratio will not change. When open, you can resize and change
aspect ratio as needed. Press A to toggle between open and closed.
 Straighten Tool: Allows for quick straightening. Select the tool (the icon
next to Angle) and then click and drag along any straight line in the photo
that should be either vertical or horizontal (say, the horizon or edge of a
building). When you release the mouse, the photo rotates accordingly.
 Angle slider: Click and drag to rotate a photo. Click the slider handle
once and use the left/right arrow keys to nudge the rotation, or click into
the number field and use the Up/Down arrow keys for a finer amount of
rotation.
 Reset: Returns the image to its uncropped state.
 Close: Click to exit the Crop Overlay. (I prefer to simply press D.)

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Figure 7-14: The Crop Overlay. 
You’ll notice the crop rectangle, its resize handles, and a guide overlay inside
the content area. You can resize and reshape the crop rectangle as desired,
but you have to move the actual photo to reposition it behind the overlay. In
other words, you can grab any resize handle to change the crop rectangle,
but you need to click and drag on the photo to move it to a new position. If
you click and drag outside of the crop rectangle, you can rotate the photo.
Removing spots and 
healing blemishes
Undoubtedly, you will encounter
photos that contain something you
want to remove, the most common
things being spots caused by dust on
your sensor or blemishes in a sub-
ject’s skin. (Oh, to have a perfect
sensor and perfect skin!) Lightroom
comes to your aid in this regard with
the Spot Removal tool, as shown in
Figure 7-15. You can access the Spot
Removal tool by clicking its icon in
the Tool Strip or by pressing N.
When activated, you see the follow-
ing Brush options:
Crop Frame tool
Straightener tool
On/Off button
Figure 7-15: The Spot Removal tool.

 Clone/Heal: This setting determines the behavior of the brush. The
Clone brush simply takes pixels from one area and pastes them into
another. The Heal brush also borrows pixels from a different area, but
goes a step further by sampling the color and texture of the area you
are “healing” and attempting to blend the two. The Heal brush works
best in most cases, but depending on the pixels you’re working with,
the blend might not always be seamless, in which case you can use the
Clone brush.
 Size: Adjusts the size of the brush. Use the [ key to decrease the size and
the ] key to increase the size.
 Opacity: Controls the strength of the brush. The lower the number, the
more the original spot will show through the adjustment. This feature
helps when you only want to deemphasize an area instead of blocking it
out completely.
 On/Off button: That little light-switchlike button in the bottom-left
corner of the panel can be used to toggle the results of the tool on and
off for comparison purposes.
 Reset: Clears all spot-removal points.
 Close: Click to exit the tool.
To see how powerful a tool this can be, follow along as I perform an extreme
makeover to the entrance to a bluebird’s house, as shown in Figure 7-16:
1. Select the photo in Grid view and press D to jump to the Develop
module — if you’re not there already.
2. Press N to activate the Spot Removal tool.
3. Choose either Heal or Clone.
4. Size the brush as needed with the [ and ] keys.
5. Set the Opacity slider to 100.
6. Click and drag the affected area to the pixels you want to borrow and
release when you have a good match.
7. Adjust source and target circles as needed for best results.
After you apply the brush to the area, you can click and drag either
circle to reposition as needed. Use the sliders to adjust the brush size
and opacity for best results. Press H to hide (or show) the circles.
8. Press D to accept the change and exit the tool.
You can go back later and readjust if needed.

Figure 7-16: Removing a really big spot.
I chose this extreme example to illustrate the power of this tool. Just imagine
what it could do with a freckle!
Correcting red-eye problems
Although the dreaded red-eye is always best avoided at the moment of cap-
ture, it’s still great to remove it with minimum hassle when it’s encountered.
There isn’t much to see with this tool until you apply it to an eye. After it’s
applied, the tool is in Edit mode and you have the following options:
 Pupil Size: Adjusts the size of the affected area inside the pupil.
 Darken: Darkens or lightens the affected pupil.
 On/Off button: That little light-switchlike button in the bottom-left
corner of the panel can be used to toggle the results of the tool on and
off for comparison purposes.
 Reset: Clears all red-eye correction spots.
 Close: Exits from the Red-Eye Correction tool.
Applying the correction is pretty straightforward. Here’s what you do to fix
the red-eyed cutie in Figure 7-17:
1. Select the photo in Grid view and press D to jump to the Develop
module.
2. Click the Red-Eye Correction tool icon in the Tool Strip.
There’s no keyboard shortcut for this one.

3. Adjust the size of the tool to exceed the size of the eye.
You can control the tool’s size with the [ and ] keys or by simply clicking
and dragging until you reach the desired size. It’s better to be a little too
big than too small. 
After you release the mouse, Lightroom moves to Edit mode, analyzing
the area and finding the “red” that needs to be removed. You’re just
telling Lightroom where to look.
4. In Edit mode, adjust the Pupil Size and Darken sliders as needed for
best results.
You just have to eyeball this one (sorry!).
5. Repeat for the other eye.
If the first adjustment looks good, then a single click will apply the same
settings to the other eye.
6. Click the Close button or press D to exit.
Figure 7-17: The Red-Eye Correction tool.
In a typical workflow, you want to always perform all of your global (i.e., entire
photo) adjustments first, which aside from the adjustments in the Basic panel,
may also include some or all of the other adjustment panels below it, before
you start using the Graduated Filter and Adjustment Brush. However, since
we’re already looking at the contents of the Tool Strip, I’m going to cover
these two tools now. The remaining adjustment panels are all covered in
Chapter 8.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Graduated Filter
If you’ve ever shot with a graduated neutral density filter to properly expose
a photo containing a bright sky and darker land, then you’ll appreciate what
Lightroom’s Graduated Filter is trying to do. However, unlike the actual filter
that goes in front of your lens, this tool allows you to adjust exposure, bright-
ness, contrast, saturation, clarity, sharpness, and even add a tint! You might
find yourself using the real filter less and less, although to be fair, if you
blow out detail because of overexposure, Lightroom can’t bring back what
isn’t there!
Activate Graduated Filter by clicking its icon in the Tool Strip or by pressing M.
When enabled you see its adjustment tools appear below the Tool Strip. The
tools are divided into the following sections:
 Mask: Allows you to either create a new adjustment or edit an existing
adjustment. You can add as many filters as you please.
 Effect: Contains all the settings you can use, alone or in tandem, to
achieve your desired results. The drop-down menu contains existing and
custom presets, which allow you to save specific settings for reuse. The
toggle switch to the right of the Effect drop-down menu controls which
Effect mode you’re in. You have two options, as shown in Figure 7-18:
Figure 7-18: Comparison of Button mode on the left and Sliders on the right.
• Buttons: This is the simple mode. Chose an effect you want to use,
click the negative or positive button, and then adjust the amount
slider to control its strength.
• Sliders: This is the advanced mode. Adjust any combination of slid-
ers with much greater control to create the desired effect.

son to how things looked before. Click the Reset button to clear all
Graduated Filter applications.
New versus Edit
Creating a new filter is your only option when starting out. However, as soon
as you click into your photo, the tool switches to Edit mode. The actual grad-
uated filter is represented by the three lines shown in Figure 7-19. The space
between the lines is where the gradual filtering takes place. The way to apply
it is to click into the photo where you want the fading of the effect to begin
and drag toward the area you don’t want affected by the filter settings. In the
test image shown in Figure 7-19, I initially clicked near the center of the image
and dragged upward. The result is that the area below where I clicked got the
maximum effect, the space between the filter guides was gradually faded, and
the area above the filter was untouched.
When placing a filter, you can click and drag in any direction, and I encourage
you to grab a photo and just play with this tool until you get a good feel for
how it works. After the filter is applied, you can increase and decrease the
fade area by clicking and dragging either outside guideline, or move the
entire filter by clicking and dragging the Edit pin — the round icon with the
black center. You can even rotate the filter by clicking and dragging the
center line. Hold the Shift key when you first apply the filter to prevent any
rotation and to achieve a perfectly perpendicular line.

Putting the tool to use
The best way to explain this tool is with an example. The subject in the Before
view of the photo in Figure 7-20 is way too dark, but any adjustment to overall
exposure or fill light is going to negatively impact the sky. I want to bump up
the exposure of the bottom half of the photo and have it blend into the sky.
Here’s how:
Figure 7-20: The Graduated Filter in action.
1. Select a photo in Grid view and press D to jump to the Develop
module.
2. Press M or click the Graduated Filter icon in the Tool Strip.
3. Set the Exposure slider to 1.
I like to use the sliders, but the same can be done with the buttons.
4. Click and drag toward the area you don’t want affected by the filter.
This is a crucial step. In this example, I don’t want to affect the sky with
my exposure boost, so I click right above the horizon line and drag up
into the sky. Everything below the point I click gets the maximum effect
of the exposure boost. The effect is gradually faded in the space between
where I start dragging and where I stop. The area above where I stop is
completely unaffected by the exposure boost.
5. Adjust filter position and size as needed.
Don’t worry if you didn’t click and drag in just the right spot the first
time. You can resize, rotate, and reposition the filter as needed.
On/Off button

6. Adjust effect settings as needed.
I usually like to start with higher-than-expected settings to help see what
I am doing, and then dial it back after getting it on the image.
7. Adjust the Recovery slider in the Basic panel to regain clipped
highlights.
In this example, the snow on the ground was clipped when I boosted the
exposure of that area. The settings in the Basic panel are still accessible
while working with Graduated Filter.
I think you’re going to love working with this filter and putting it through its
paces. Just to show that I’m fair to all the tools on the Tool Strip, though, I’m
going to highlight some of the features of the Graduated Filter’s very close
relative, the Adjustment Brush.
Adjustment Brush
If you thought the Graduated Filter was cool, the Adjustment Brush is going
to make your jaw hit the floor. It works in essentially the same way, except
that you use a brush to paint on the effects with a great deal of control as
opposed to a graduated filter. The Adjustment Brush allows you to paint with
any combination of exposure, brightness, contrast, saturation, clarity, sharp-
ness, and color. This allows for an amazing level of local adjustment possibili-
ties, which means far fewer trips to the external editor!
To activate the Adjustment Brush, you click its icon in the Tool Strip or select
your photo and press K. Yes! The Adjustment Brush has its own universal
shortcut, so no matter where you are in Lightroom, pressing K takes you
right to the brush. When the brush is active, you see its settings appear
under its icon. The settings are divided into the following four sections:
 Mask: Allows you to either create a new adjustment or edit an existing
adjustment.
 Effect: Contains all the settings you can use alone or in tandem to achieve
your desired results. The drop-down menu contains existing and custom
presets, which allow you to save specific settings for reuse. The toggle
switch to the right of the Effect drop-down menu controls which Effect
mode you’re in. You have two options (the same as the Graduated Filter):
• Buttons: This is the simple mode. Choose an effect you want to
use, click the negative or positive button, and then adjust the amount
slider to control how much effect you want before you start painting.
• Sliders: This is the advanced mode. Adjust any combination of slid-
ers with much greater control to create the desired effect.
171
Chapter 7: Develop Module Basics

172
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
 Brush: Controls the brush settings. You can’t adjust any of these set-
tings after the effect is applied, so you want to get this right before you
start. Here are the options:
• A/B: You can configure two different brush settings to make
switching between favored settings easier.
• Erase: Allows you to “paint” with an eraser to clean up stray
strokes. You can click the Erase button to activate or you can hold
down Alt (Option on a Mac) while painting. Note: The Brush cursor
switches from a + to a – when Erase is enabled.
• Size: Controls the size of the brush. Can also be adjusted with the [
and ] keys.
• Feather: Adjusts the softness of the edge of the brush. Can also
be adjusted by holding down the Shift key in conjunction with
[ and ] keys.
• Flow: A low flow amount allows you to build up the effect slowly
with each stroke. A high flow amount applies more of the effect
with each stroke.
• Auto Mask: When this box is checked, Lightroom attempts to
detect the edges of the object you’re painting to prevent the effect
from spilling over the edge and affecting other areas. The clearer
the edge, the better Auto Mask works.
• Density: Limits the strength of the effect.
 On/Off: Click the On/Off toggle button at the bottom to disable the
results of the adjustment. This feature can be good for a quick compari-
son to how things looked before. Click the Reset button to clear all
Adjustment Brush applications.
New versus Edit
When you first apply a brush stroke to your photo, Lightroom marks the first
spot of contact with an Edit “pin,” as shown in Figure 7-21. You can click and
release as often as needed to continue applying the effect to other areas of
your photo. All your painting continues to be associated with that original
Edit pin until you click New in the Mask section. At any point, you can acti-
vate an Edit pin by clicking it once to adjust the settings applied by the asso-
ciated strokes. The settings panel highlights when you’re in Edit mode to
show you what settings can still be adjusted.
If you place your cursor over a pin, the associated strokes glow to show you
where you’ve painted. This is especially helpful with subtle adjustments. The
glow vanishes when you move away from the pin; however, you can also
enable this “stroke indicator” glow by pressing O to keep it on while you are
painting (press O again to turn it off). Press Shift+O while the glow is on to
cycle through white, black, red, and green highlight colors (which may help
you see it better based on the colors in the photo you are adjusting). To
remove a pin (and its associated effect), press Delete while in Edit mode.

Putting the brush to use
I want to walk through one possible use of this brush to show you how it
works. Figure 7-22 shows a Before and After view of a Shar-Pei I met on the
street. She was very curious and a good model. I really like the shot, but one
side of her face is a little too much in shadow. Before Lightroom 2, my best
option would have been to take this photo into Photoshop and apply a local
adjustment to open up the shadows around the one eye. Those days are
gone! Here’s what I can do:
1. Select the photo in Grid view and press K.
2. From Button mode, click + Exposure and set the amount to 1.
3. Adjust the size of the brush slightly smaller than the target area.
4. Set the Feather to 100.
5. Set Flow to 50.
I like to set a medium flow amount to build up the effect.
6. Uncheck Auto Mask.
Auto Mask is great when you have clear lines separating the area you
want to adjust from the area you don’t want to adjust (like the roof line
of a building versus the sky above it) but in my example it’s all dog hair
at different brightness levels and I want to create a smooth transition
between the different levels of brightness. No lines here.

7. Set Density to 100.
8. Click into the target area on the photo and paint in the effect.
I start at the eye and build up the effect with a series of clicks until I
achieve the desired result. Remember: You can dial back the Amount
slider if needed to reduce the effect, and clean up stray edges with the
Erase feature.
As a finishing touch, I switched the brush to Slider mode and configured a new
brush to decrease exposure and boost saturation, and then painted over the
background to give it a richer look. You can see the edit pin in the upper-right
corner. This tool is so much fun you’re going to have a hard time stopping, too!

irst things first. I say throughout this book that Lightroom is a workflow
tool, and each part of the workflow consists of smaller work-
flows. The process of developing a photo is no different —
developing has a beginning (the import state) and an end
(your vision for that photo), but you have to jump
through a series of hoops (or workflows) before you get
to that end. Which hoops you choose depends on
which tools you rely on to get your work done, so
your workflow may look quite different from mine.
I address the most common adjustments you make
to most of your images in Chapter 7 (such as basic
tonal adjustments, cropping, and spot removal), now
it’s time to explore the rest of what the Develop
module has to offer (that is, all the adjustments below
the Basic panel) to really set your photos apart. Keep in
mind, though, that the basic tonal adjustments you’ve made
already aren’t set in stone. If you decide to work with the Tone
Curve, convert to grayscale, or apply a different camera profile, for exam-
ple, go back and tweak your earlier settings for better results. All these
adjustments are performed on the same set of image data, which is why the
Histogram panel is attached to the top of the right panel. Refer to it often,
toggle your clipping indicators on and off from time to time (by pressing J) to

176
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
make sure that contrast boost didn’t blow out a highlight or that a creative
vignette didn’t clip some important detail to black. No setting is made in
isolation.
Often the difference between an okay photo and a fantastic one is subtle —
so subtle that the untrained eye may not even perceive what that difference
is, but you know it when you see it. Typically, this difference is related to
the attention to detail and finishing touches that are applied by a person
skilled at his craft. The tools in this chapter focus on the techniques you can
use to give each photo that “something special” that elevates it above a well-
exposed capture.
Working with Contrast and Color
Being able to manipulate contrast and color digitally is very powerful and a
lot of fun. Like anything else, the more you do it, the better you get at it. More
importantly, the more you do it, the more you refine your eye and your own
style. The adjustments you make in this area will have a dramatic effect on
how people react to your work. You can easily lose a little perspective on
your own work after you’ve looked at it, tweaked it, and changed it. To help
with that problem, take advantage of the tools Lightroom offers — from creat-
ing snapshots of your progress to preserving certain settings as presets, to
creating virtual copies to creating multiple versions — as a way to bring
some objectivity back into the creative process. Never forget that everything
you do in Lightroom can be undone! Take some time to step back and look at
the history to see how far you’ve come, and possibly change course if things
aren’t going the way you’d envisioned.
Mastering the Tone Curve
The primary purpose of the Tone Curve panel, as shown in Figure 8-1, is to
provide you with a set of tools you can use to adjust the amount of contrast
in your photo. Contrast gives photos a depth and a richness that most people
find pleasing. Images lacking contrast are often referred to as flat.
Contrast is increased or decreased by adjusting the brightness of the tones
within your photo. A typical contrast adjustment might involve decreasing
the brightness of the darkest tones while simultaneously increasing the
brightness of the lighter tones, which creates contrast between these bright
and dark regions. This type of contrast adjustment is what Lightroom applies
to all raw photos by default (I tell you how you can change that below). 
In the top half of the Tone Curve panel, you see a square window that con-
tains the histogram with the active photo in the background and a diagonal
line running from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner. That diago-
nal line is the curve. By bending that line, you’re in effect  increasing or
decreasing the brightness of all the pixels at a given point in the histogram. In

Figure 8-1, the curve represents
Lightroom’s default medium contrast
curve. If you look very closely, you
can see a slight dip at the lower-left
end and a slight bump at the upper-
right end. This subtle S shape is a
classic contrast curve. The more
exaggerated you make the bends (or
curves) in that S appear, the greater
amount of contrast you see in your
photo.
Any curve adjustments you make are
reflected in the real histogram — the
one perched in the Histogram panel,
sitting there on top of the Tone
Curve panel. The histogram inside
the Tone Curve panel, however,
remains unchanged no matter how
many adjustments you do as a
reminder of the before curve state.
The greater the curve adjustment
you make, the more difference you
see between these two histograms.
Enough of the preliminaries. Time to
look at how you actually make things
happen and bend that line. As is con-
sistent with every other part of
Lightroom, you have more than one way to achieve the same result. Here are
the ways you can make contrast adjustments with the Tone Curve panel:
 Apply a Point Curve preset.
 Click and drag points on the curve itself.
 Adjust the sliders below the curve.
 Click and drag the photo with the Target Adjustment Tool.
Some of these methods may sound a bit techy — especially the Target
Adjustment Tool — but don’t let that worry you. I go over each method in
detail in the next few sections.
Applying a preset
Even though you choose presets at the very bottom of the Tone Curve panel
(see Figure 8-2), I give it a place of honor in my discussion because, if you’re
working with raw images, Lightroom has already applied the Medium
177
Chapter 8: Taking Your Photos to the Next Level
Figure 8-1: The Tone Curve panel.

178
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Contrast preset by default. This
preset is actually a pretty subtle
adjustment, and if you like it, you’re
done! You aren’t required by law to
change the contrast if you’re already
happy with the default state. That
said, here are the two other preset
options you can select in the Point
Curve drop-down menu:
 Linear: Takes the curve out of
the curve, which means no
additional contrast adjustment
has been made. Rendered files
have this preset applied by
default, or rather no additional
contrast is applied to JPG, TIF,
or PSD files by default.
 Strong Contrast: A slightly
larger S curve than medium
contrast, which means darker
shadows and brighter
highlights.
Interacting with the curve
With a Point Curve preset in place,
you can make a custom adjustment
by manually manipulating the curve.
That line represents all the tones,
from black to white, that could exist
in your photo. The Tone Curve his-
togram is a graph showing you the number of pixels in your photo at each
tonal level. By clicking a point on that line, you can move that point up or
down to increase or decrease the brightness of all the pixels at that particular
tonal level. You immediately see this adjustment reflected in the photo and
the live histogram.
As an alternative, you can hover the cursor over a point in the window and use
the up- and down-arrow keys to make the adjustment in + or –5 increments.
Because being able to go back is always good, you can access a helpful Reset
contextual menu by right-clicking (Control-clicking on a Mac) anywhere
inside the window. (See Figure 8-3.)
Sliding the sliders
Not too much to this one: The Highlights, Lights, Darks, and Shadows sliders
correspond to the four regions that make up the complete tonal range of your
Figure 8-2: The Point Curve presets.

image. Click and drag a slider to
increase or decrease the brightness
of the pixels in the corresponding
region. Alternatively, you can place
your cursor over the number field to
the right of the sliders, and a small
scrubby slider appears that you can
click and drag to make an adjust-
ment. (If you’re a keyboard fiend,
you can use your up- and down-
arrow keys to make the adjustment
in + or –5 increments.)
Using the Target Adjustment Tool
Pronounced tat for short, this is the
tool for people who’d rather just
work right in the photo instead of
looking at sliders, numbers, or
curves. After a little practice, you
may just find it feels more natural and
a little more intuitive.
Click the TAT icon, as shown in
Figure 8-4, to activate it and then
move your cursor over the photo.
Notice your cursor changes to a
crosshair (this is the working end of
this tool) with the TAT icon trailing
behind it (this is just a reminder that the tool is active). To make an adjust-
ment, click a spot in the photo that represents the tonal region you want to
adjust and then drag up to make the spot brighter or down to make it darker.
Enhancing and changing colors
Who doesn’t like the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel? In fact, this is one of those
panels where you might find yourself getting a little carried away simply
because it is so much fun. My advice to you: Gather some practice images
and get all that wild colorizing out of your system. That way, when you really
need to use this panel, you can be a little more subtle.
Unless you’ve selected a true monochrome image (a photo that really has
only one channel), the photos you work with in Lightroom will be RGB (Red,
Green, Blue) images, which means you’ll always have the information con-
tained in each of the three RGB channels to work with, even when you’re
looking at a grayscale image.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Figure 8-4: The Target Adjustment Tool icon.
The HSL/Color/Grayscale panel, as shown in Figure 8-5, is actually three
panels in one. The HSL and Color options are essentially variations on the
same set of controls, which allow you to adjust the hue, saturation, and
luminance values in your photo. The Grayscale options are for converting
a color photo to grayscale. Because grayscale conversion is a topic unto itself,
I cover it in great detail in the next section. For now, though, I want to call
your attention to a unique aspect of this panel — the HSL/Color/Grayscale
labels in the panel’s header are also the buttons used to switch between each
option. While you move your cursor over each label, the label lights up. The
label you select remains highlighted to indicate which option is active.
Figure 8-5 shows the Color face of the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel — the Reds
section, to be more precise. Along the top of the panel is a row of color
swatches that represents each of the colors you can adjust. Click any swatch
to activate the controls for that color or click the All button to see all the con-
trols at once. Each color has three possible adjustments:
 Hue: This adjustment shifts the color between all its possible hues.
 Saturation: Use this slider to change the intensity of the hue.
 Luminance: This slider changes the brightness level of the hue.
TAT icon

The HSL options, as shown in Figure
8-6, group the adjustments by hue,
saturation, and luminance instead of
by color. You can see the labels for
each grouping across the top of the
panel. Click each label to activate the
controls for that group or click All to
see the controls for all three groups
at once.
I think you’ll find that using the HSL
face of the panel is a more intuitive
way to work, mainly because of the
way the Target Adjustment Tool has
been integrated for each group of
adjustments. The Target Adjustment
Tool functions just like it did in the
Tone Curve panel, except it controls
the adjustment of sliders in your chosen group: Hue, Saturation, or
Luminance.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Creating black and white images
In the absence of color, an image becomes a study in light and shadow, texture
and detail in a very different way than would be the case with color photos.
Because of this, black and white photos can often achieve a visual impact that
color photos can’t. When converting a color photo to black and white, the
process starts with a conversion to grayscale but the process doesn’t end
there. To see all that’s involved, start by taking a look at the Grayscale face of
the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel and then follow along as I address how you can
call on a few other Lightroom panels to enhance the final result.
To initiate a grayscale conversion on the active photo, try one of the follow-
ing methods:
 Press V.
 Click the Grayscale button in the Treatment section of the Basic panel.
 Click the Grayscale label of the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel.
Note: The General – Grayscale preset — part of the Presets panel on the left
side if the interface — does convert a photo to grayscale, but the preset also
includes an auto white balance and an auto tone function as well. (Give this
preset a try to see whether you like it.)
To see how this whole grayscale conversion process works with the HSL/Color/
Grayscale Panel method, follow along as I recount the steps I take to move a
photo from its Color state to its Grayscale state:
1. Select the photo in the Filmstrip and press V.
2. Adjust white balance settings in the Basic panel as needed.
Keep in mind that, even though you see a grayscale image, all the color
data in the original image is still at your disposal. Adjusting the Temp
and Tint sliders while in Grayscale mode can bring out additional detail
and texture.
3. Readjust basic tonal settings in the Basic panel as needed.
Similar to white balance, now that you’re working with a range of
grayscale values, you might find that an adjustment to exposure or to
the black clipping level is required to achieve your desired result.
4. Expand the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel, as shown in Figure 8-7.
This is your opportunity to pick up where Lightroom left off and adjust
the mix of color data to bring out the tonal qualities of the image you’re
after.

5. (Optional) Click the Target Adjustment Tool (TAT) inside the Grayscale
Mix panel.
Although you can certainly adjust individual color sliders in the panel,
you’ll find that working right inside the photo with the TAT is a much
more intuitive and satisfying process.
6. If you decide to use the TAT, click a tone in the photo and drag the
tone down to darken or drag up to brighten.
This is where your creativity and vision come together! While you click
and drag the TAT, the corresponding Grayscale Mix sliders move within
the panel. You can always undo an adjustment by pressing Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z
on a Mac) or by stepping back to an earlier history state. This explo-
ration process is also a good time to make use of the Snapshots panel if
you want to preserve a particular state. (For more on the Snapshots
panel, see Chapter 7.)
7. If you chose the TAT route, click the Done button in the Toolbar to
quit the TAT after you complete your mix adjustments.
Figure 8-8 shows you the kinds of transformations you can achieve with
the Grayscale face of the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel.
Figure 8-7: The Grayscale Mix controls.
Just because you’ve completed the grayscale mix doesn’t mean the photo is
finished. Depending on the photo and the result in your mind’s eye, you may
go on to do any (or all) of the following to finish the job:
183

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
 Use the Adjustment Brush in the Toolstrip to make Dodge and Burn
local adjustments.
 Use the Tone Curve panel to increase contrast.
 Use the Split Toning panel to add color to the highlights and shadows.
 Use the Vignettes panel to darken or lighten the edges.
Figure 8-8: A Before and After example of a grayscale conversion.
The best way to know when done is actually done is to roll up your sleeves
and experiment. The wonderful thing about Lightroom is that none of these
adjustments will alter the pixels in your original images. You can always go
back. Making use of the Snapshots panel to preserve key states in the devel-
opment process or even virtual copies to branch out into multiple versions
gives you a lot of room to move.
Adding color to shadows and highlights
The most common use of the Split Toning panel — the panel stuck right
under the HSL/Color/Grayscale panel — is to add a hint of a color tint to
grayscale images. That doesn’t mean you can’t use it with color images, too.
Split toning actually allows you to add one color tint to the highlights and a
second color tint to the shadows, with the Hue and Saturation sliders for
each region. (See Figure 8-9.)
In Lightroom 1, you could either adjust the Hue slider or enter numerical
values directly into each field. Now, in Lightroom 2, you can also click the
color swatch to access a popup color palette, which makes the process much

more interactive. Moving your
cursor over the color palette
changes the cursor to an eyedropper
tool.
Click any color to apply that Hue and
Saturation settings and get a live pre-
view of your photo. Click and drag
left or right to change the hue or up
and down to change the saturation.
As an alternative, click a point to
select a color and then use the left
and right arrow keys to change the
hue, or the up- and down-arrow keys
to adjust saturation.
You have one last adjustment to
make (or not — the choice is yours)
after you select your Highlight and
Shadow colors, and that adjustment
involves the panel’s Balance slider.
By default, the panel gives equal
weight to the highlight and shadow
tints. If you move the Balance slider to the left, you shift the balance toward
the Shadow tint, whereas an adjustment to the right favors the Highlight tint.
If taken to either extreme, the Balance slider gives the effect of applying a
single tint.
The Devil’s in the Details
Working your way down the right side of the Lightroom interface, your next
stop is the Detail panel, which is your place for getting up close and personal
with your photos. I think you’ll agree with me that, sometimes, you need to
zoom to the 1:1 view to see what’s happening in your photo. In fact, the only
way you can really see the adjustments made in the Detail panel is when
you’re in at least 1:1 zoom level (or greater). To make that easier, the folks at
Adobe added a nice little 1:1 Preview window to the Detail panel in
Lightroom. (See Figure 8-10.) You can click and drag inside the Preview
window to view different areas of the photo or click the squarish crosshair to
the left of the window to focus on a different area of the photo. If you want to
zoom closer, you can right-click (Control+click on a Mac) inside the window
to choose either the 1:1 or 2:1 zoom level from the contextual menu that
appears.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Now that I’m sure you can see what
you’re doing, I feel comfortable
pointing out how you can put the
Detail panel to good use in your
never-ending struggle to produce the
perfect photo. The next few sections
give you the details.
Applying capture 
sharpening
Sharpening can’t correct an out-of-
focus image, but sharpening can
increase the perception of detail in a
properly focused image. Lightroom 2
has come a long way in regard to
sharpening. You can now put sharp-
ening to use in both Print and Web
modules, as well as in the Export
dialog box. In addition, you can paint
with sharpness by using the
Toolstrip’s Adjustment Brush for
more creative and localized sharpen-
ing applications. When put together
in a sharpening workflow, you can
now apply the sharpening in the
Detail panel as it was originally
intended, which is simply to com-
pensate for the inherent softness in
raw captures.
Sharpening is a very powerful adjust-
ment, and as with most powerful
things, you should never use more
than the minimum required to get
the job done. Increasing sharpness
can bring details to life, which can
translate into a greater visual impact. Increasing sharpness too much can
make a photo appear crunchy and overprocessed and cause a negative reac-
tion to the image. You always want your sharpness setting to be just right — if
anything, you might want to err on the softer side.
One of the key traits that humans find pleasing to the eye is the separation of
edges around certain details (sharpening). The human eye is drawn to this
edge detail and sharpening can be used to bring a viewer in closer. Lightroom’s
sharpening controls are all about edge detection and enhancement. If you look
at Figure 8-10, you see the following Sharpening controls at your disposal:
Figure 8-10: The 1:1 Preview window.

 Amount: This is simply the amount of sharpening being applied. An
increase in the amount translates to an increase in sharpening.
 Radius: This determines how far that sharpening amount extends from
the edges being sharpened. The higher the radius, the farther the reach
from the edges.
 Detail: This determines how much of the finer detail between the promi-
nent edges has sharpening applied to it. The higher the setting, the more
the finer detail edges are sharpened.
 Masking: Provides a means to protect areas of the image from having
sharpening applied. No mask means all areas have sharpening applied to
them. A high mask means only the most defined edges have sharpening
applied.
By default, all raw photos have a moderate amount of sharpening applied.
However, you may want to move beyond the defaults, depending upon the
subject matter of your photos. One of the best ways to understand how this
panel was intended to be used is to examine the settings contained in the two
sharpening presets against the default sharpening settings. The chart in
Table 8-1 compares the default values against the values found in the presets
Sharpen – Landscapes and Sharpen – Portraits (found in the Presets panel on
the left side of the Lightroom interface).

Here’s what the Adobe folks were thinking when they came up with a
Landscapes preset and a Portraits preset. In a typical landscape photo, you
see a lot of details. In fact, overall detail is a favored trait. You want to see
details. Detail draws in the eye. Now think about a portrait. Detail is certainly
important, but only in certain places. Sharpness of the eyes is very impor-
tant. Showing every pore and wrinkle in sharp relief is not important.
Looking at the settings of the Landscapes preset, you see the amount is set to
40, compared to 35 in Portraits. Not a huge difference, but it’s not surprising
that Landscapes would get a greater amount of sharpening. I come back to
Radius at the end, but for now, I want to move on to the Detail setting. The
187
Chapter 8: Taking Your Photos to the Next Level

188
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Landscapes Detail setting is twice the default, whereas the Portraits setting is
lower than the default. This too makes sense because you definitely want to
bring out the finer detail in a landscape, but not in a person’s skin. Now, as
you compare the Masking setting of 0 for Landscapes versus 70 for Portraits,
you can see that sharpening is being applied to all areas of the landscape
image, but only on the most defined edges of the portrait. This high Masking
value also explains why the radius (or reach) was slightly bumped up in the
portrait image to thicken the edges of the most defined features, knowing
that the finer detail was going to be left unsharpened.
So, ask yourself the following question: Is your photo more like a portrait,
where only the most defined edges should be sharpened, or is your photo
more like a landscape, where even the finest detail needs a boost? With that
determination in mind, I suggest applying the appropriate preset even if you
just use it as a new starting point over the default.
To see how all this works in tandem with the Detail panel, follow along as I
walk through one example. Figure 8-11 shows a Before and After version of a
photo that clearly falls into the Portraits category. The Before version has all
the Sharpening settings zeroed out for the sake of comparison.
Figure 8-11: A Before and After comparison of an application of capture sharpening.
1. Click the eye (or an equally important detail) to zoom into 1:1 view.
You can only see the effects of the sharpening when you’re zoomed to 1:1
in the content area or are looking at the 1:1 Preview in the Detail panel.

2. In the Presets panel on the left side of the Lightroom interface, apply
the Sharpen – Portraits preset.
In many cases, you can stop right there, but for the sake of explaining
the process, I want you to see if you can finesse this starting point.
3. Increase the Amount setting and then dial the setting back until you see
nice edges without any jagged pixels or white haloing along those edges.
Hold the Alt key (Option on a Mac) while dragging the slider to see your
photo in grayscale. Sharpening is applied only to the luminance (bright-
ness data), not to the color data, so seeing the photo in grayscale pro-
vides another way to see what exactly is happening to the photo.
4. Leave the Radius at its default.
By making the decision about what preset to apply, you’re already in the
ballpark. If anything, you may want to dial back Radius, but in reality,
your energy is better spent on the other three adjustments.
5. Hold the Alt key (Option on a Mac) and increase the Detail slider until
you can see unwanted detail appear and then dial the slider back
until only your key edges are visible.
By using the Alt (Option) modifier with this adjustment right from the
start, you can really focus on just the detail. In this example, I dialed up
Detail until I could see pores on the skin and then dialed it back until
those pores were diminished. Keep in mind that by applying the Portrait
preset, you already have a high-level mask being applied, which limits
the areas being sharpened.
6. Increase the Masking amount if necessary to compensate for increases
made to the Detail setting.
The Alt (Option) modifier works with this slider too! In this case, you see
the mask itself. Areas of white in the mask are the areas where sharpen-
ing will be applied. Black areas will have no sharpening.
7. Check other areas of the photo at 1:1 to evaluate the level of sharpen-
ing applied.
At the end of that process, the settings I preferred were not very far from the
Portraits preset. Would anyone notice that difference in a normal viewing
environment? Not likely. When you’re processing tens, hundreds, or thou-
sands of photos, you don’t want to spend this kind of time finessing the cap-
ture sharpening on a photo-by-photo basis. Get a good feel for what the
sliders can do, create your own presets (or use the existing ones) that suit
your needs/tastes, and apply those presets in batches to your photos.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Dealing with noise
The middle section of the Detail panel deals with noise reduction — no, not
that acoustic paneling stuff. In terms of digital photography, noise is simply
random electrical signals recorded by the camera’s sensor that can degrade
the quality of the photo. In the absence of light, these random signals are
more visible because the sensor records less actual data, which is why noise
issues are common in underexposed photos.
Lightroom’s noise-reduction options are pretty simple (refer to Figure 8-10),
but they can be effective when it comes to reducing minor noise issues. You
have one slider for increasing the amount of luminance noise reduction, and
another slider for reducing the effects of color noise. After you figure out how
to differentiate between the two, it’s simply a matter of adjusting the respec-
tive slider just enough (and no more) to solve the problem. Here’s my handy
guide to telling luminance noise from color noise apart:
 Luminance noise tends to look like the more familiar grain you see in
film. You have fluctuations in brightness levels whereas color remains
essentially consistent — common in areas of blue sky.
 Color noise can be recognized by the presence of multicolored pixels
(like Christmas tree lights). Typically present in the shadow areas of
your photos.
Figure 8-12 shows a Before and After example of a color noise reduction.
Continue to increase the Color slider until you’ve neutralized as much of the
random multicolored pixels as you can.
As for luminance noise, the most likely place you’ll encounter that headache
is in blue skies. Figure 8-13 shows a Before and After example of a blue sky
with the typical grainy signs of luminance noise. To counteract the noise level
seen in the Before image, I adjusted the Luminance slider until the tones in
the sky smoothed out.
The main issue to watch for with any type of noise reduction is the loss of
detail. Too much noise reduction can turn your photo into a mush of pixels
resembling a watercolor painting. Having a little noise and more detail rather
than less noise and pixel mush is usually better.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Reducing chromatic
aberration
If you ever notice a purplish fringe
along an edge of high contrast in
your photos, you’re looking at a case
of chromatic aberration. The problem
results when your lens can’t focus all
wavelengths of light at that particu-
lar point, and this problem is most
commonly seen with wide-angle
lenses. Luckily for you, you can usu-
ally correct it pretty easily with the
Detail panel’s very own Chromatic
Aberration controls, as shown in
Figure 8-14.
The adjustment works by reducing
the size of one of the three RGB
color channels relative to the other
two — by adjusting either the
Red/Cyan or Blue/Yellow sliders.
You have to play it a bit by ear (or by
eye), but holding down the Alt key
(Option on a Mac) while adjusting
each slider can make eyeballing the
adjustment a bit easier. (Holding the
Alt modifier key reduces the color in
all but the area of the color fringe,
making the changes easier to see
during the correction.)
If the slider adjustments aren’t com-
pletely removing the fringe, choose
Highlight Edges from the Defringe
drop-down menu. This setting is usu-
ally just enough to get you in the
ballpark. Figure 8-15 shows a Before
and After example of a combination
Blue/Yellow slider adjustment coupled with the Highlight Edges Defringe
option. The purple fringe is scaled back considerably.
Figure 8-14: The Chromatic Aberration
controls.

Figure 8-15: A Before and After view of a chromatic aberration correction.
Working with Vignetting
Although originally intended as a correction tool, the Vignettes panel is more
often used these days for the creative effects it can produce. A bad vignette
happens when you have unwanted darkening around the edge of a photo,
usually caused by the reduction of light entering the lens (such as interfer-
ence from stacked filters). Proving the old adage of when life gives you
lemons, make lemonade, some folks decided they kind of liked that darkening
around the image because it almost acted as a matte or a framing device.
This phenomenon of the Good
versus Bad vignette led to the rather
schizophrenic makeup of the
Vignettes panel, as shown in Figure
8-16. The panel has two distinct sec-
tions, each with its own definite
agenda:
 Lens Correction: Allows for the
correction or the application of
a vignette from the outer edge
of the photo toward the center.
Because this is intended as a
correction tool, it only works on
an uncropped version of the
photo.
193
Chapter 8: Taking Your Photos to the Next Level

194
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
 Post-Crop: Reach for this tool when you want to add a vignette for cre-
ative effect. Not only do you have more adjustments to refine the effect,
but it works equally on the cropped and uncropped versions as well.
Two sections, two agendas. The next two sections take a stab at each one.
Correcting a photo with a vignette
Although you’re better off making sure your lens configuration doesn’t create
a vignette in the first place, if the unfortunate event does occur, you can use
the Lens Correction section of Lightroom’s Vignettes panel to help reduce the
effects of an unwanted vignette. The section has two controls:
 Amount: Moving the Amount slider in a positive direction (to the right)
brightens the edges of your uncropped photo. The Amount slider essen-
tially helps you recover any data that may still exist in that darkened
area around the edge and blend it with the rest of the photo. Keep in
mind that, if the vignette is extreme (fades all the way to black), this
adjustment won’t bring back detail that isn’t there to begin with.
 Midpoint: If the Amount slider alone isn’t completely removing the
vignette, a slight adjustment of the Midpoint can provide a little boost.
Adjust to the left to brighten and adjust to the right to darken the center
of the photo.
This Lens Correction tool only helps with the mildest of vignette problems.
If you can’t completely remove the darkened edge with the Lens Correction
sliders, your best bet may be to crop inside the vignette to remove the
outside edge.
Creative vignette applications
The Post-Crop vignette controls were added in Lightroom 2 after the explo-
sion in popularity of adding a vignette as a creative effect. The goal here isn’t
to remove a vignette but to apply one! Applying a vignette is a simple way to
create a framing effect that draws the eye into the photo. Like any creative
effect, you can easily overdo it, but I really enjoy the effect all the same.
Another great thing about the Post-Crop vignette is that it reapplies the
vignette settings to the cropped version of the photo should you use
Lightroom’s Crop tool (located in the Tool Strip) after having already applied
a creative vignette.
You can play around with four separate sliders in the Post-Crop section:

 Amount: As you might expect, this slider controls the amount of the
added vignette. Move to the left to darken and to the right to brighten.
Unlike the Amount slider in the Lens Correction section, this Amount
slider doesn’t attempt to brighten the edge of the vignette that bleeds
into the photo, but rather it adds black or white to the edge from the
outside in.
 Midpoint: This increases or decreases the area at the center unaffected
by the vignette. Moving the slider all the way to the left reduces the mid-
point and by extension, maximizes the range the vignette can extend
into the center of the photo. Moving the slider to the right has the oppo-
site effect.
 Roundness: Increasing the Roundness value results in a more circular
vignette, whereas decreasing roundness results in a more elliptical result.
 Feather: This controls the amount of fade applied to the edge of the
vignette into the midpoint. A feather setting of 0 results in a hard-edged
solid border, whereas a feather setting of 100 results in the most gradual
transition from the midpoint to the edge of the photo.
There’s no right or wrong way to apply a vignette; it’s completely a matter of
personal taste. To see what I like in a vignette, check out Figure 8-17, which
shows the kind of drama you can achieve when you add a darkened vignette
to a photo.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Modifying the Camera Calibration Settings
The Camera Calibration panel, the last panel for this chapter, provides the
ability to customize the default rendering of your raw photos. Adobe creates
a profile for each camera it supports, and this is what is used as the default
rendering for raw photos from your camera. If you see a consistent rendering
issue with your raw photos, you can tweak the default rendering to your
liking. Here’s what this panel has to offer:
 Profile: This drop-down menu shows the version of the profile being
used with your camera. In most cases, you have only one profile, but
Adobe has revised the profiles for some cameras in the past, so depend-
ing upon your camera model, you may see more than one. (Figure 8-18
shows the ACR [Adobe Camera Raw] 4.4 profile.)
 Shadows: Allows for the correction of a tint in the shadow areas.
 Red, Green, and Blue primaries: Lets you adjust the hue and/or satura-
tion of each of the primary colors used to render the color in your photos.
Each slider is color-coded to indicate which direction to move to create the
desired adjustment. I don’t recommend making a correction just by eye-
balling the colors in your photos, though. The actual calibration process isn’t
for the beginner, but if you’re interested in reading more about how it’s done
and what tools you need, Ian Lyons put together an excellent resource to get
you started. Check out this resource at www.computer-darkroom.com/

Using an External Editor
In This Chapter

 Configuring external editor defaults
 Developing an external editor workflow
 Using advanced editing features in Photoshop CS3
L
ightroom’s Develop module contains an array of powerful editing tools
and can accomplish many tasks that were previously performed in an
image editor, such as Photoshop. However, at times, you have to move
beyond Lightroom to achieve certain results (such as creating image col-
lages, performing selection based editing, using Photoshop plugins, and so
on). The important distinction to make between editing in Lightroom and
editing in an external editor is that Lightroom never alters the original
pixels in your source photos. Instead, Lightroom records the
adjustments you make inside the catalog file as a set of
instructions to be applied to copies of the original photos
during output. By writing your changes as a set of
instructions, you up Lightroom’s speed when process-
ing large numbers of files and you enable its unlim-
ited undo functionality (because you can always step
back through that set of instructions).
On the other hand, most image editors are pixel edi-
tors at heart, which is a good thing! Pixel-level edit-
ing is extremely powerful, and Photoshop’s the best
tool for the job. When you want to combine the pixels
in one image with the pixels in another image, create
detailed selection around an object, or take advantage of
layer-blending modes to get a specific result (just to name a
few examples), call on a pixel editor. The external editor function
comes into play any time you need to send photos out of Lightroom to
leverage the power of a pixel editor.

198
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
Configuring Your External Editors
I go over the External Editor settings back in Chapter 1 — along with all the
other preference settings — but I want to remind you of them since this is
where you actually use them. Because Lightroom is an Adobe product, it
does play favorites with Photoshop and Photoshop Elements. Lightroom
reserves the primary (default) external editor slot for either Photoshop or
Elements and will automatically recognize them if they’re installed. If you
have both Photoshop and Elements installed, Lightroom defers to Photoshop
as the default editor. Although it’s not possible to manually configure the
default editor, you can choose any other image-editing application as the sec-
ondary editor (and save the settings as a custom preset). Here’s how to set
up your primary external editor settings, as shown in Figure 9-1:
Figure 9-1: External Editing preference settings.
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Lightroom➪Preferences on a Mac) from the
main menu.
The Preferences window displays.
2. In the Preferences window, click the External Editing tab.

3. Choose your default file type from the File Format drop-down list.
PSD and TIFF file formats are, for all intents and purposes, equal to the
task of supporting anything you can imagine doing in Photoshop. TIFF is
a more widely supported format outside of the Adobe family whereas
PSD is Photoshop’s native file format. I tend to lean toward TIFF, but you
really can’t go wrong either way. Refer to Chapter 3 for a more in-depth
look at file formats.
4. Choose your default color space from the Color Space drop-down list.
Your choices here are ProPhoto RGB, Adobe RGB, and sRGB. If you’ve
configured your camera to save photos in raw format and want to main-
tain as much of the original color as possible throughout the editing
process, choose ProPhoto RGB. If you’ve configured your camera to
save photos in JPG format, you’ve already made a color space choice in
your camera settings, so you may as well choose that same color space
here to be consistent. 
5. From the Bit Depth drop-down list, choose your default bit depth.
This option goes hand in hand with color space. If you chose ProPhoto
as your color space, choose 16 Bits/Component. (ProPhoto is a 16-bit
color space.) If you didn’t choose ProPhoto, choose 8 Bits/Component.
The important difference is that a 16-bit file contains much more data
than an 8-bit file, which is great for editing but does come with a greatly
increased file size.
6. (Optional) If you selected the TIFF file format, you can also choose
either Compressed or Uncompressed TIFF.
You get the same data either way, but compressed TIFF takes longer to
open and save, whereas uncompressed TIFF files have a larger file size.
I favor uncompressed because I prefer the speed benefit over the file
size cost.
With your primary external editor configured, you can move on to setting up
an additional external editor. Do you need one though? Well, whether you
need one or not is entirely up to you and your workflow. You may not have
Photoshop or Elements, or perhaps you prefer another image editor for cer-
tain tasks. Lightroom just provides you with the option. Here’s how to set up
an additional external editor:
1. Click the Choose button in the Additional External Editor section of
the External Editing preferences dialog box (refer to Figure 9-1).
2. In the dialog box that appears, navigate to the application file you
want to use, and then select it and click Choose.
199
Chapter 9: Using an External Editor

200
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
On a PC, you find the application files in the Program Files folder. On a
Mac, you want to look in the Applications folder. In both cases,
Lightroom should open the correct folder by default, but if it doesn’t
you’ll have to navigate to the right place. After you’ve selected the appli-
cation and clicked Choose, you’re brought back to the External Editing
dialog box with your application choice displayed.
3. Configure File Format, Color Space, and Bit Depth as desired.
The choices you make here depend on the image editor you choose (not
every application supports 16-bit files, for example), but be consistent
with the settings you choose for your primary editor.
4. Choose Save Current Settings as New Preset from the Preset drop-
down menu.
Doing so launches the New Preset dialog box. This is an optional — but
recommended — step which is new to Lightroom 2. By saving your
Additional Editor settings as a preset you can actually configure more
than one additional editor, which simply gives you more options for how
you want to edit your photos. You could even save different configura-
tion settings for the same application. (Perhaps you want a 16-bit preset
as well as an 8-bit, whatever fits your needs.)
5. Give the preset a descriptive name and click Create.
The preset names will display in the External Editor menu when you
choose to send a photo out for additional work, so give it a name that tells
you the name of the application and possibly hints at the settings used.
This will only make life easier for you when you want to use the preset. 
After you’ve created that preset you can go back to Step 1 and repeat
the process to configure additional applications if you wish. At any point
in the future, you can return to this dialog box and add new editors.
Figure 9-2 shows the Preset drop-down menu extended to reveal two dif-
ferent presets I created for two different image editors (LightZone and
NeatImage).
6. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
When Lightroom creates a copy of your source photo to send to an external
editor, it needs to give that copy a new name — technically, just a variation
on the source photo’s name. The naming convention you want Lightroom to
use when it creates these copies is the last option in the External Editing pref-
erence dialog box (refer to Figure 9-1). By default, Lightroom appends -Edit
to the end of the filename. (You can see an example of this to the right of Edit
Externally File Naming heading.) If that works for you, you don’t need to do
anything else. If you want to customize how edited files are named, you can
choose Edit from the Template drop-down menu and configure a naming
convention of your choice in the same Filename Template Editor I cover in
Chapters 4 and 6.

Figure 9-2: Preset menu showing multiple additional editor presets.
If you choose to work with the PSD format, open Photoshop’s preferences
and turn on Maximize Compatibility. Choose Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling
from the main menu (Photoshop➪Preferences➪File Handling on a Mac) and
set Maximize PSD and PSB File Compatibility to Always. This enables
Lightroom to import your layered PSD files without any problems.
Basic Editing in an External Editor
The most common reason to send a photo from Lightroom to an external
editor is when you simply need to do something with a photo that Lightroom
cannot do (or doesn’t do as well as some other editor). This typically comes
after you make all the Lightroom adjustments your photo requires and before
you’re ready to move to some form of output (print, slideshow, Web, file
export). Here’s how to send photos to an external editor from Grid view in
the Library module:
1. Select your photo(s) in either the Filmstrip or Grid view.
Technically, you can access the External Editor menu from just about any-
where you can see a photo inside of Lightroom, but the most likely place
will be from either Grid view in the Library module or the Filmstrip in any
module. (Refer to Chapter 1 for an overview of the interface components.)
201
Chapter 9: Using an External Editor

202
Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
You can send more than one image to your external editor just be aware
that the more files you send, the more computer resources are required
to process that much data.
2. Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the photo and choose your exter-
nal editor from the contextual pop-up menu that appears by choosing
Edit in➪Edit in (your editor).
Figure 9-3 shows the menu options if you have Photoshop CS3 as your
primary editor. In this example, I sent my selected photo to Photoshop,
but the process works the same for all editors. You can see the addi-
tional editor presets I made earlier in the chapter are listed there as well.
Figure 9-3: The Edit in External Editor contextual menu.
After you select your editor, Lightroom does a few things, such as
• Rendering a copy of the selected photo based on your external
editor default settings.
• Opening that photo in your external editor.
Note: What’s really happening here is a file hand-off between Lightroom
and your external editor. If you’re working with raw files in Lightroom, a

rendered copy of the raw file always has to be created before it can be
sent to your external editor. However, if you’re sending a rendered file
(PSD, TIF, or JPEG) to your external editor, you have some choices, as
shown in Figure 9-4, such as
• Edit a Copy with Lightroom Adjustments: This is the only option
that enables you to incorporate your Lightroom adjustments into
the file you edit in the external editor. If you’re sending a layered PSD
or TIF file and you choose this option, the layers will be flattened so
that the Lightroom adjustments can be applied to the image.
• Edit a Copy: This option simply creates an exact copy of the
selected photo and opens it in your editor. Any layers in the origi-
nal image remain intact. No Lightroom adjustments are applied.
• Edit Original: Your original image is opened in the editor as it was
the last time you saved and closed it in an external editor.
3. Perform desired edits in the external editor.
4. Save and then close the photo in the external editor.
Don’t choose Save As in this step because you’d be making a new copy
of that file that Lightroom doesn’t know anything about. By saving and
then closing the file, you’re telling Lightroom you’re done working on it,
and Lightroom will update its preview of that photo to reflect the
changes you made.

Part III: Working in Your Digital Darkroom 
You may have noticed the other options listed in the submenu in Figure 9-3.
You need Photoshop CS3 to take advantage of Lightroom’s ability to send
multiple photos directly to Photoshop CS3 as a panorama, HDR (high
dynamic range), smart object, or layers. If you don’t have Photoshop CS3,
this may just be enough to change your mind. To see what you’re missing,
check out my discussion of each of those options in the following section.
Advanced Editing Options with Photoshop CS3
New to Lightroom 2 are some advanced external-editing options that leverage
powerful functionality built into Photoshop CS3 (and only CS3). This integra-
tion creates a direct path from inside Lightroom right into the chosen
Photoshop option, so it’s a real timesaver for those who were using these
options previously. For this to work, you’ll need to make sure you have the
latest version of Photoshop CS3 installed (go to Help➪Updates in the
Photoshop menu to check). Since this is a Lightroom book, I’ll just highlight
what you need to know on the Lightroom side of the equation, but if you want
to learn more about Photoshop CS3 specifically, I highly recommend picking
up a copy of Peter Bauer’s Photoshop CS3 For Dummies (Wiley)!
There are four menu options, as shown in Figure 9-5, which only appear if you
have Photoshop CS3 installed:
 Open as Smart Object in Photoshop: A smart object is a special kind
of Photoshop layer that embeds a copy of the photo you select in
Lightroom inside the layer. The benefit of this option is that you retain
the ability to go back and edit the embedded source file at any time
while working in Photoshop. 
Going the smart object route is most useful when your source photo hap-
pens to be a raw file, because then a copy of the raw file itself is embed-
ded within the smart object. If you wish to make further adjustments to
the raw file, you can open it from the smart object into Photoshop’s raw
editor plug-in Adobe Camera Raw, make your adjustments, and put it
back inside the smart object to continue your Photoshop editing. This
can be a very powerful editing combination.
 Merge to Panorama in Photoshop: A panorama is a photo that encom-
passes a very wide field of view (sometimes as much as a full 360
degrees). While there are some cameras that can capture a single
panoramic photo, it is far more common these days for a photographer
to create a panorama from a series of photos which, although taken from
the same point, manage to cover a wide range of the scene. Photoshop
has a powerful feature called Photomerge that can take a series of these
photographs and seamlessly combine them into a single merged photo.
It is really very impressive technology! This Lightroom function allows

you to select your series of photos in Lightroom and send them directly
to Photomerge inside of Photoshop.
 Merge to HDR in Photoshop: HDR stands for High Dynamic Range,
which means a photo that contains detail all the way from the brightest
highlights to the darkest shadows. Our eyes (and brain) are quite good
at this by design; just imagine standing in your house looking out at a
bright sunny day. You can see detail in the shadows of the room you are
in as well as the white puffy clouds in the sky outside the window. Now,
try to take a photo of that same view that captures the shadow detail of
the interior as well as the highlight detail of the clouds — you can’t!
Your camera just can’t capture detail across that wide of a range of
brightness levels, at least not in a single photo. 
It is possible to take a series of photos of the same scene while changing
the exposure with each photo to capture a different range of brightness
values (from dark shadows to bright highlights) and then combine them
all into a single photo that does contain the full high dynamic range of
brightness levels. This is where the Merge to HDR function comes into
play. If you have such a series of photos, you can select them in Lightroom
and then use this menu command to send them directly to Photoshop’s
Merge to HDR function, which then does the work of combining them into
a single image. Head over to the HDR group on Flickr (www.flickr.com/
groups/hdr) to get a taste of what HDR images look like.
 Open as Layers in Photoshop: This option is not as fancy as the other
three, but it may be the one you use most often. What it does is allow
you to select multiple photos in Lightroom and send them all to a single
new document in Photoshop with each photo being placed on its own
separate layer. This is extremely handy when you have two or more
photos that you’d like to combine into a single composite photo, such as
taking multiple photos of the same group of people and creating a com-
posite that shows a final version where everyone’s eyes are open and
mouths are shut. 
The workflow with these advanced options is essentially the same as the
basic editing in that you still
1. Select the photos you want to send to Photoshop from within Lightroom.
2. Choose the type of editing option you want to use from the Edit In
menu.
3. Perform the work inside of Photoshop.
4. Save and close the file in Photoshop and return to Lightroom.
If you only have a single photo selected, the only Photoshop CS3 option that
will be enabled is Open as Smart Object in Photoshop, as the other three
options all require multiple photos to be selected.

Sharing Your Work
with the World

In this part . . .
You’ve come this far, and now it’s time to lift
the curtain and put your work in front of your
audience, whether it’s a client, an art buyer, a col-
league, or friend. Lightroom provides a variety of
output options, so if you’re curious about how
you can produce copies of your source ﬁles for a
wide range of end uses, Chapter 10 should be your
ﬁrst stop. 
From there, I introduce you to the Slideshow
module in Chapter 11, and walk you through the
process of creating your own custom slideshows. 
Chapter 12 is all about getting your photos into a
Web gallery, customizing it to ﬁt your style, and
then putting it online for the world to see. 
I wrap up Part IV with Chapter 13, an in-depth look
at the Print module. I cover all the steps in the
process for producing the best possible output,
whether you’re sending it to a locally connected
printer or to a print service.

T
hose in the know about Lightroom will tell you that your photos are
never actually inside Lightroom. (I’m in the know, and I make that exact
same point in Chapter 4.) Such a We’re-So-Lightroom-Hip-We-Can-Make-
Seemingly-Off-The-Wall-Claims kind of statement does beg the question that if
the photos are never in Lightroom, why does exporting sound an awful lot
like you’re getting them out? Good question! “It depends on what the
meaning of the word ‘is’ is . . .”
Oops, sorry about that — wrong question. Nevertheless, it
does depend on how you define “export.” In Lightroom,
the export process could be called “creating copies of
your photos while applying your Lightroom adjust-
ments” but it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the
same way as “exporting” does. However, that is
what’s really happening here. If you’re familiar with
Photoshop or Elements, then you can think of export-
ing as a Save As command on steroids. No matter how
you think about it, the essential point you need to keep
in mind is that this is how you apply your Lightroom
edits to copies of your source files.

210
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
You export images for many reasons, and here are a few of the most common:
 You want to e-mail photos to someone.
 You want to burn a group of images to DVD/CD.
 You want to upload to a photo-sharing site, an online print service,
or your Web server.
In each case, you’re going to have a specific output destination with specific
file requirements, which is what will drive the choices you make when config-
uring the export settings. Take a closer look at what is involved.
Exploring the Export Dialog Box
Before I get into all the ways to access the Export dialog box, shown in
Figure 10-1, and the overall workflow involved with the export process, I’d
like to introduce you to what you’ll find there so that you have a sense of
what’s involved as you move forward: 
 Preset section: A consistent Lightroom feature is the ability to save a
collection of settings as a preset to make it faster and easier to use those
same settings again in the future. The left side of the dialog box is
reserved for the creation and management of export presets.
 Plug-in Manager: Export plugins are third-party scripts that extend
Lightroom export functionality by allowing you to perform additional
tasks, such as applying a watermark or uploading files to photo-sharing
sites, as part of the export process. You’ll use the Plug-in Manager to
find and install new export plugins.
 Export [some number of] Selected Photos To: The topmost section in
the main part of the dialog box is used to choose where you are going to
export your photos to. Assuming you have a CD and/or DVD burner
installed, you’ll have two default options — Files on Disk or Files on
CD/DVD, which are accessible via the drop-down menu. If you’ve
installed any export plugins they’ll also appear in the drop-down menu. 
 Export Location panel: Continuing through the panels, the Export
Location panel is for choosing where you want the exported copies
saved. No matter what may happen with the photos after the export is
complete, they first need to be saved to a location on your disk. 
 File Naming panel: As exporting always involves creating copies,
Lightroom provides you with the opportunity to decide how those
copies are to be named. The File Naming panel displays all the filename
templates you may have created earlier (during import or while working
in the Library module) as well as providing access to the Filename
Template Editor used to create new templates.

 File Settings panel: Here you choose which file format (JPG, PSD, TIFF,
DNG or same as the source file) you want the copies saved as; you can also
configure any file specific settings here, such as color space (the gamut of
colors it contains) and bit depth (the amount of data it contains).
 Image Sizing panel: This panel provides the ability to resize JPG, PSD,
or TIFF files created during export.
 Output Sharpening: Provides the option of applying additional sharpen-
ing to the copies based on where these they are going to be viewed
(either on screen or in print).
 Metadata panel: Control how much metadata (ranging from camera-
generated shooting information to keywords) is included with the
exported copies. There is also the option to add a small textual 
watermark on JPEG, PSD, and TIFF files.
 Post-Processing panel: When using the Files on Disk option, you can
have Lightroom open your exported copies in another application (like a
file browser or another image editor) to facilitate moving to the next
stage of your workflow.
Figure 10-1: The Export dialog box.
I highly recommend confirming the number of files to be exported before you
click the Export button. The number is displayed right above the configura-
tion panels. (In Figure 10-1, for example, it reads Export 10 selected photos to.)
I have discovered on more than one occasion that I accidentally selected
more photos than I intended to export. Believe me, the last thing you want is
to find that you just exported several thousand more images than you
needed! Thankfully, a Cancel button is included, too.

Panels are collapsible and expandable. Click a panel label to collapse or
expand that panel. Ctrl+click (Ô+click on a Mac) any panel label to collapse
or expand all panels. Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) any panel label to
enable or disable Solo mode (meaning only one panel can be expanded at a
time). When a panel is collapsed, you see a summary of its settings displayed
in the header. When you eventually install export plugins (and I suggest that
you do so), you’ll find that they add several configuration panels to the
dialog; therefore, using Solo mode reduces the need to scroll and allows you
to see all settings at a glance. Nice!
Okay, enough of the introduction. Time to take a step back and look at all the
steps involved in the export process and then I’ll drill down deeper into the
settings used in each export panel.
Creating Copies of Processed Photos
You’ve processed your photos like a pro, and now its time to send them out
into the world. That means it’s export time! There’s a lot of power behind the
humble Export dialog box, and with a little practice, you can harness all it
has to offer.
Employing an export workflow
Lightroom (as you’ve probably figured out by now) is a workflow application,
and within the larger workflow of taking your photos from input to output,
there exists many smaller workflows within workflows. Export is no excep-
tion. Here are the basic steps:
1. Select the images you want to export.
2. Initiate the export command.
3. Configure settings as needed to meet your output needs.
4. (Optional) Save settings as a preset for reuse.
In some cases you may not need, or want, to create a preset for every
export. Additionally, after you create a preset, you don’t need to create
it again.
Here’s a closer look at each step in the workflow, and a follow up with a real
world example.
Step 1: Selecting the images you want to export
Your output needs determine which files you export. You can export images
from within any Lightroom module, but you’ll soon find that the Library

module gives you the greatest access to your entire portfolio and exporting
from there makes a lot of sense. So, if you’re not there already, press G to
jump to the Library’s Grid view. From here, you have access to all your fold-
ers and collections, as well as the Browse bar, meaning you can go ahead and
track down the images you want. (Go ahead, take your time.)
After you locate the images you want to export, you can select them by any
of the following methods:
 Pressing Ctrl+A (Ô+A on a Mac) to select all photos within a folder or
other grouping of photos.
 Clicking the first image in a series, holding the Shift key, and clicking the
last image in the series to select all images in between.
 Holding the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac) and clicking each image individually
to make a noncontiguous selection.
Step 2: Initiating the export command
After you select the images, you can initiate an export from any module
(except where noted) through the following means:
 Choose File➪Export. Launches the Export dialog box.
 Choose File➪Export with Previous. Skips the Export dialog box and
simply exports selected files by using the settings from the last export.
 Choose File➪Export with Preset➪Select Preset. Allows you to select
a preset and export without additional configuration of the Export
dialog box.
 Press Ctrl+Shift+E (Ô+Shift+E on a Mac). Keyboard shortcut that
launches the Export dialog box.
 Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E (Ô+Option+Shift+E on a Mac). Keyboard short-
cut for Export with Previous.
 Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) a selected photo and choose one
of the previously mentioned export options from the contextual menu
that appears.
 Click the Export button at the bottom of the left panel in the Library
module. Only visible in the Library module, but comes in handy.
Can’t say Adobe didn’t give you enough choices! I would encourage you to use
the keyboard shortcuts in your workflow as soon and as often as possible.
They’ll be second nature before you know it and they’re great timesavers.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Step 3: Configuring settings as needed to meet your output needs
Okay, okay, I admit it. The broad overview of the export dialog box’s panels I
provide earlier in the chapter is fine, but we’re going to need to drill deeper
to understand how each panel works. So get ready for the gory details.
The first choice you’re going to make is if you plan to export Files to Disk,
Files on CD/DVD, or some export plugin (which I’ll cover at the end of the
chapter). Your most common choice will be Files to Disk. Refer to Figure 10-1
to see the drop-down menu expanded. From there, you configure all the
panels relating to the choice you made. While additional panels will appear
with different export plugins, they are too specific and varied to be covered
here. I’ll only focus on the panels that come with the two installed options
(Disk or CD/DVD).
The Export Location panel
The Export Location panel, shown in Figure 10-2, is used to configure where
you want to save a batch of copies on your hard drive. Even if you ultimately
burn these copies to DVD or hand them off to another application, Lightroom
first needs to save the copies to your hard drive. 
Where you choose to save the files is driven by two factors: how you manage
your files and what you determine your output needs to be. The Export To
drop-down menu provides two options for designating a location:
 Specific Folder: When selected, you can point Lightroom to any folder on
your disk. Just make sure it has enough free space to hold all the new
copies. Click the Choose button and navigate to the folder you want to use.
 Same Folder as Original Photo: This option does exactly what it
describes, which is to put your exported copies back into the same
folder the original is found.
If you’re exporting copies because you decided you want to e-mail them, you
might not have any need for those copies after the e-mail is sent (since you
can always re-export new copies). For this type of transitional export, I have
created a special folder on my main disk named Delete that I choose as the
Export To folder in those situations. Just remember to periodically go into
that folder and send those files to the Recycle Bin (Trash on a Mac). 
After you choose the location for the export, you have a few additional
options to consider:
 Put in Subfolder: This option allows you to create a subfolder within the
designated export location. Check the box and enter a name for the sub-
folder in the corresponding text field.
 Add to This Catalog: Think of this as an Automatic Import option. After
your copies are exported, they’ll appear inside Lightroom without
having to go through the Import dialog box.

 Stack with Original: Stacking is a folder-specific function that allows
you to arrange groups of photos within a given folder under a single
thumbnail for organizational purposes. This option is only available
when you’re exporting copies back to the same exact folder as the origi-
nals (and not putting them in a subfolder). When checked, the exported
photos appear stacked with the source photos when you view that folder
in Lightroom.
Since it’s possible that you may be exporting photos into a folder that already
contains other photos, Lightroom needs you to tell it how to handle situa-
tions where your exported copies have the same name and are the same file
type as the existing photos. You have four options:
 Ask What to Do: This is the safest option, and the one I recommend
using. If such a situation occurred, Lightroom would prompt you for fur-
ther instructions, where you would choose one of the other three
options. I like having the reminder.
 Choose a New Name for the Exported File: In this case, Lightroom would
simply append a new sequence number to the end of the exported file, so
you would end up with two copies of the same file but with unique names.
 Overwrite WITHOUT WARNING: Does what it says (and it even uses all
caps in the drop-down menu! Only choose this option if you are really
sure it is what you want to do. Note: Lightroom will not allow you to
overwrite the source photos, so don’t choose this option thinking you
can export copies with Lightroom adjustments and save over the exist-
ing source files — it won’t work.
 Skip: If an existing file is encountered, no new copy will be created (i.e. it
will be skipped).

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
The File Naming panel
In many cases, you’ll want to maintain name consistency between your
source files and your exported copies. By simply choosing the Filename tem-
plate, you can achieve just that. Other times, you may want to use custom
names that are completely different or perhaps some variation of the original
name. In any case, since you’re always creating copies, you have to tell
Lightroom how you want them named, and just like during Import or renam-
ing in the Library module, Lightroom uses filename templates to do it.
Click the Template drop-down list, as shown in Figure 10-3, and choose one of
the installed templates, or you can click Edit and create a custom filename
template using the good old Filename Template Editor. See Chapter 4 for
more information about creating filename templates.
Figure 10-3: The File Naming panel expanded to show the Template drop-down list.
The File Settings panel
Choose your file format based on your output needs (such as choosing JPEG
for photos going on a Web site). Some formats might require additional set-
tings. Here’s a list of the formats and their options:
 JPEG: When choosing the JPEG (or JPG) format you also need to choose
the level of compression to be applied to each JPEG file. This is done
with the Quality slider, as shown in Figure 10-4. The higher the quality
value, the less compression — and the larger the file size. JPEG compres-
sion is always a tradeoff between file size and image quality. If you’re not
too concerned about file size, then leave it set to 100. 

Figure 10-4: The File Settings panel expanded to show JPEG format and Quality slider.
 PSD: Photoshop’s native file format. There are no additional settings
with the PSD option.
 TIFF: TIFF is a widely supported format. Use the panel’s Compression
drop-down list to pick one of the lossless compression options, as
shown in Figure 10-5. (“None” is pretty straightforward; ZIP and LZW
means the file size will be reduced, but the length of time to open and
close the file will increase, plus not all image editors can open com-
pressed TIFF files.) Note: Only the ZIP compression option is available
with 16-bit files.
Figure 10-5: TIFF format and compression options.
217
Chapter 10: Exporting Photos

218
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 DNG: This is Adobe’s open format for raw (unprocessed by the camera)
photos. Figure 10-6 shows the configuration options available with DNG.
The lowercase file extension is the norm, so there’s no reason to change
it. The medium-size JPEG preview is a good compromise on file size.
The default conversion method settings are great because they preserve
the raw data and create a smaller file using lossless compression. The
big choice is if you want to embed the original raw file or not. You would
want to embed the original raw file if you felt there may come a point in
time where you might want to extract the original raw file so that you
could process it in software that doesn’t work with DNG. The downside
to embedding the original raw file is that you double the file’s size
because you’ll have the converted raw data and then add the entire orig-
inal unaltered file as well (which just sits untouched in case some day it
is needed). I prefer to leave this unchecked.
 Original: Selecting Original from the drop-down list results in the creation
of an exact copy of your source image. There are no additional file settings.
Figure 10-6: DNG configuration options.
There are two additional options that only appear when JPEG, TIFF, and PSD
formats are chosen that warrant a separate discussion (raw files are always
16 bit and don’t have a color space):
 Color Space: A photo’s color space is what determines the range of pos-
sible colors it can contain. You need to decide what color space you
want these copies converted into during the export process. Your
choice of color space is completely determined by the reason you are

exporting these copies to begin with. You’ll find a more in-depth look at
color spaces in Chapter 3, but here’s a look at your choices: 
• sRG: This color space contains the narrowest range of colors and is
the standard for exporting photos destined for the Web, but is also
used by some print services.
• AdobeRGB (1998): Contains a wider range of colors than sRGB and
is most often used when additional editing or printing is the next
destination for your files.
• ProPhoto RGB: Contains the widest range of colors and should only
be used with 16-bit files. (I’ll discuss bit depth next.) This is the
best option when you want to retain all the color information that
was in your source files. Not recommended when delivering copies
destined for the Web or anyone not used to working with ProPhoto
color space.
• Other: While the previous three options are the most common,
there may also be advanced situations where you need to convert
your files to a custom color space for printing purposes. Consult
with your print service to see if it provides or requires custom pro-
files and it will help you get them installed. By choosing Other,
you’ll be taken to the Choose Profiles dialog box, where you can
select the desired color profile.
 Bit Depth: Bit depth determines the amount of data a file contains. The
higher the bit depth, the more data is contained in the file (which also
means its file size is going to be larger too). If you’re working with raw
files, then you’re working with 16-bit files. If you’re working with JPEG
files then you’re working with 8-bit files. During export, you have the
option of saving PSD and TIFF files in 16 bit. If you choose JPG, you will
see that bit depth is grayed out, but know that JPEGs are all 8 bit by
default. It only makes sense to save files in 16 bit when both the source
files were originally 16 bit and when the output needs require this origi-
nal data (such as if you are going to be archiving the exported copies to
DVD or are going to be editing them in some other image editor). In all
other situations, 8 bit will be the more common choice. 
The Image Sizing panel
There are circumstances where you might need to save your exported copies
at a different size from the source photos, such as when e-mailing them or
putting them in a Web page, and this is where the Image Sizing panel comes
into play (see Figure 10-7). Lightroom can make the exported images smaller
or larger than the original images — a process known as resampling. The four
different options for resizing your exports are 
219
Chapter 10: Exporting Photos

220
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 Width & Height: The values entered for width and height define the maxi-
mum amount each side can be resized to fit while maintaining original
aspect ratio.
 Dimensions: This option resizes exported images to fit within the
entered dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio. When this option is
selected, height and width are no longer associated with the values
fields. You just enter the maximum dimensions you want the images
resized to fit and Lightroom does the rest regardless of orientation.
 Long Edge and Shortest Edge: These both function in the same manner.
You set the maximum value for the edge in question and Lightroom
resizes all images to fit accordingly.
Check the Don’t Enlarge box to prevent an image from being resampled larger
than its original pixel dimensions. (This option is grayed out when Resize to
Fit is unchecked.)
If your output needs require your photos to print at a specific size and at a
specific number of pixels per inch (PPI), you can set its resolution value —
the metadata tag used by software to determine how big the printed file
should be. For example, the value of 300 PPI is commonly requested by print
services, in which case you would enter 300 and choose pixels per inch. 300
PPI is always a safe choice, but if your photos are destined for the Web only,
this value is meaningless and can be ignored. 
Figure 10-7: The Image Sizing panel.

The Output Sharpening panel
A new feature in Lightroom 2 is the ability to add sharpening tailored for
the specific output destination as part of the export process. The Output
Sharpening panel, as shown in Figure 10-8, is where you choose and configure
your output sharpening settings. The possible output settings are defined as
 Screen: This is used when your photo’s final viewing destination will be
on a computer screen (i.e. on a Web page).
 Matte Paper: This is for when you are sending your photos to be printed
on a type of photo paper that has a matte (nonshiny) finish.
 Glossy Paper: This is for when you are sending your photos to be
printed on a type of photo paper that has a glossy (shiny) finish.
After you’ve identified what output you are sharpening for, you can set the
amount of sharpening to apply; your choices here range from Low (almost
none) to High (often too much), with Standard in the middle (which is a good
default choice).
Figure 10-8: The Output Sharpening panel.
The Metadata panel
The Metadata panel, shown in Figure 10-9, offers the following settings:
 Minimize Embedded Metadata: Although this option isn’t grayed out for
TIFF and PSD files, it really only works on JPG files. It’s intended to be
used in those situations where you want to deliver a JPG with all meta-
data removed except for your copyright information. 
221
Chapter 10: Exporting Photos

222
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 Write Keywords as Lightroom Hierarchy: Keywords are the descriptive
terms you assigned to your photos in the Library module. When this
option is enabled, and if you’re using keywords with parent/child rela-
tionships (meaning the keywords are in a hierarchical structure), then
the exported copies will retain that same keyword structure. This is
useful for photos that will be imported into another Lightroom catalog
or managed with Adobe Bridge. Lightroom’s use of keywords is
explained in Chapter 6.
 Add Copyright Watermark: When this box is checked, Lightroom pulls
the information from the Copyright field of each file’s metadata and ren-
ders it as a watermark in the lower-left corner of each exported copy.
There are no configuration options for the watermark.
Figure 10-9: The Metadata panel expanded.
The Post-Processing panel
This is an optional setting that only appears when using the Files on Disk export
option, but it can provide a nice productivity boost to your output when you
know your photos are going to be opened in some other application after they
have been created (such as for e-mailing or additional image editing). The Post-
Processing panel (with the After Export drop-down list expanded) is shown in
Figure 10-10. With the help of this panel, you can tell Lightroom to hand off your
exported images to another application — in effect, having Lightroom perform
what is commonly referred to as an “export action” on your stuff.

The After Export drop-down list includes the following preinstalled options:
 Show in Explorer (Show in Finder on a Mac): Automatically opens the
folder containing the exported images in your file browser.
 Open in Photoshop: If you have Photoshop installed, then you have the
option to open the exported images in Photoshop after they’re saved to
the export location.
 Open in Additional editor: If you’ve configured an additional external
editor (refer to Chapter 9) you’ll see it listed here as an option.
 Open in Other Application: Selecting this option gives you the opportu-
nity to designate another application (such as an e-mail client, an alter-
native image editor, or an FTP client) that will be invoked at the end of
the export. Lightroom will attempt to open the exported photos in that
application; just keep in mind that not every application can accept
images this way. Click the Choose button and navigate to the application
that you want to send your photos to.
Figure 10-10: Post-Processing panel expanded to show After Export options.
At the bottom of the After Export drop-down list is the Go to Export Actions
Folder Now command. Selecting this option opens Windows Explorer (Finder
on a Mac) with Lightroom’s Export Actions folder selected. You can place
either an executable file or a shortcut (alias on a Mac) to an executable file in
the Export Actions folder to include it as an option in the After Export drop-
down list the next time you start Lightroom. This is another way to set things
up so you can send your photos to a specific program or a Photoshop
droplet with one quick command.
223
Chapter 10: Exporting Photos

224
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
“What’s a droplet?” you say. A droplet is a Photoshop action that you manage
to turn (with Photoshop’s help) into a tiny executable file. After you create a
droplet, you can literally drag and drop photos on top of it to run the photos
through the action automatically — a really powerful way to run a batch of
images through a favorite action — applying a specific Photoshop filter, say,
or converting to an alternative color space, or applying a custom watermark.
By including the droplet as an export action Lightroom automatically runs
the exported copies through the droplet after they have all been created.
Saving settings as a preset for reuse
Presets are such an awesome timesaver! Just think about it — you get to save
scads of commonly used settings and then access them any time you want
directly from the File➪Export with Preset menu. Sweet!
Figure 10-11 shows the Presets panel — it’s there on the left side. You get
three preinstalled presets to start you off, right under the Lightroom Presets
heading — presets that can’t be ditched or updated, by the way. They are
 Burn Full-Sized JPEGs: Sets JPG as the file format with the least com-
pression and no resizing and then adds burning the exported images to
a disc as an After Export step.
 Export to DNG: Sets DNG as the file format, which essentially means
you’re set to convert to DNG on export. Note: Using this preset only
makes sense when your source files are raw format.
 For E-Mail: Sets JPG as the file format with 50 percent JPG compression
and resizes all images to fit within 640 x 640 pixels. Note: This preset
doesn’t actually pass files to your e-mail client; it just configures the
export to an e-mail–friendly size.
Figure 10-11: The preinstalled export presets.

I’m the first to admit that the preinstalled presets aren’t incredibly sophisti-
cated, but they do make good starting points and can help you see the possi-
bilities. I often create DVDs of full-sized JPG copies that I give to friends and
family so I took the Burn Full-Sized JPEGs preset as a starting point and cus-
tomized it to my liking. Here’s how I did that:
1. Click the Burn Full-Sized JPEGs preset to load its settings into the
dialog box.
2. Expand the Export Location panel.
When I create these JPEG copies, I’m not interested in keeping them
after burning to disk, so I want to change the export location to a differ-
ent folder.
3. Click the Export To drop-down menu and choose Specific folder.
4. Click the Choose button and navigate to the desired folder.
Again, in my case I called upon my special Delete folder so I can easily
get rid of these copies after the disk has been created.
5. Leave the settings in the remaining panels as they are.
This is up to you of course, but the remaining settings work great for me
so there was no need to change them.
6. Click the Add button at the bottom left of the Lightroom Presets panel.
This opens the New Preset dialog box.
7. Enter a descriptive name in the Preset Name field.
8. (Optional) Create a new folder in the process of saving your preset.
You can click the Folder drop-down list and choose an existing preset
folder or create a new one. I find keeping presets organized in folders
makes it easier to find the one I’m looking for.
9. Click the Create button to complete the process and have the preset
added to the Preset panel.
You can delete custom presets and folders by highlighting them and clicking
the Remove button. Note: Removing a folder deletes any presets inside of it!
You can share presets among other workstations by right-clicking (Control+
click on a Mac) the preset and choosing Export from the contextual menu
that appears. Copy the preset to the destination workstation and right-click
(Control+click on a Mac) the folder you want to keep it in and choose Import.
Presets can be updated with new settings by adjusting the settings as
desired, right-clicking (Control+click on a Mac) the preset, and then choosing
Update with Current Settings.
You can’t update the preinstalled Lightroom presets with new settings.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Putting it all together
Time for a walk through the export process from start to finish. I love making
photographs of the New England landscape as it transforms from one season
to the next. It’s such a visually rich area to live in! Awhile back, I came across
a program called Helicon Focus, which can combine multiple shots of the
same scene with different focus points into a single photo that’s in complete
focus from foreground to background. The effect is just stunning, displaying
an incredible amount of detail and depth.
Because I’m a workflow kind of guy, I immediately play out the process from
(raw) start to (stunning) finish. I shoot raw, so first I must process my image
series in Lightroom. When my adjustments are complete, I can export full-
sized TIFF copies straight to Helicon Focus.
And here’s where the light bulb came on. If I set it so that Helicon Focus is
ready, willing, and able to accept my images as part of an After Export step, it
would create a seamless workflow. Here’s how I’d accomplish just that:
1. Press G to jump to Grid view in the Library module and choose the
folder containing the photos you want to select for export.
I’m thinking five photos of pristine New England wilderness should do
fine. In my case I used the Ctrl+A option to select all photos in that folder,
but how you select them is not as important as making sure they are
selected. You could just as easily have conducted a keyword search or
chosen one of your collections to gather the photos you wanted to export.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+E (Ô+Shift+E on a Mac) to launch the Export dialog.
Alternatively, File➪Export works, too.
3. Expand the Export Location panel and then select a specific folder to
save the files to.
After I’ve combined these photos into a single photo, I want to save the
final version back to my source folder, but I’ll no longer need the
exported copies used in the process. For this reason, I’m going to
choose my Delete folder as the destination for these copies. I periodi-
cally clear out the files in this folder to conserve disk space.
4. Expand the File Naming panel and then select the Filename template.
No reason to change the filename in this instance.

5. Expand the File Settings Panel and then select TIFF format with no
compression.
No need to apply compression because these files aren’t keepers anyway.
6. Choose ProPhoto RGB for Color Space and 16 bits for Bit Depth.
I want to minimize conversion of color spaces and take advantage of all
the data contained in my original raw file. This option creates the largest
file size, but provides as much of my original data as possible.
7. Expand the Image Sizing panel and uncheck Resize to Fit so that no
resizing takes place.
8. Expand the Output Sharpening panel and uncheck the Sharpen For box.
This is not the final output stage for these photos, so no need to apply
output sharpening yet.
9. Expand the Metadata panel and uncheck all options.
10. Expand the Post-Processing panel.
11. In the After Export drop-down list, choose Open in Other Application.
12. Click the Choose button and navigate to the program file.
In my case, I’d navigate to the Helicon Focus executable file. (This would
be located in the Program Files on Windows or the Applications folder
on a Mac.) The same process is used to assign any other application as
an export action.
13. (Optional) Click the Add button to save settings as a preset.
You’ve gone through the trouble of configuring the dialog how you want
it, so you might as well benefit from your labor and save it for reuse.
14. Click the Export button to start the process.
Figure 10-12 shows the completed Export dialog box.
After clicking Export, the dialog box goes away and you’ll see Lightroom’s
progress meter start advancing as each copy is saved to the export location.
After all copies have been created, the application designated in the Post-
Processing panel opens, displaying the exported copies. Everything’s ready
for you to begin the next stage in your workflow.

Extending Possibilities with Export Plugins
Along with the release of Lightroom 1.3 came the Export Software
Development Kit (SDK). The Export SDK opened the door for third-party
developers to extend Lightroom’s export functionality in an almost limitless
number of ways. That is, by installing specific export plugins, you’re no
longer limited to simply exporting files to disk and then uploading them to
your online print service, photo-sharing site, or Web server. Say you want to
perform additional image manipulation that isn’t possible in Lightroom, for
example. Well, with the right export plugin, you can interact with external
programs in a number of new ways. Here are some examples of the available
export plugins:
 Export to Flickr: Sends your photos right to your Flickr account.
 Export to Zenfolio: Sends your photos right to your Zenfolio account.
 Export to SmugMug: Sends your photos right to your SmugMug
account.
 Export to PicasaWeb: Sends your photos right to your PicasaWeb
account.
Flickr, Zenfolio, SmugMug, and PicasaWeb are all online photo-sharing sites.
You need to have an account to connect with any of the services. In each
case, the export plugin interfaces directly with the service right in the Export
dialog box. Figure 10-13 shows the Flickr export plugin interface.

Figure 10-13: Flickr Export Plugin info expanded.
That’s all fine and dandy, but you’re probably wondering how to get your
hands on some of these plugins. Thankfully Lightroom 2 makes it a little easier
to find some, but first we’re going to click the Plug-in Manager button (refer to
Figure 10-1) on the bottom of the Export dialog box to open the Lightroom
Plug-in Manager dialog box shown in Figure 10-14. Note: You can also access
the Plug-in Manager at any time from the File➪Plug-in Manager menu.
Figure 10-14: The Lightroom Plug-in Manager dialog box.
229
Chapter 10: Exporting Photos

230
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
From there you can click the Plug-in Exchange button on the bottom of the
dialog box. This opens your Web browser to Adobe’s Lightroom Exchange
service, which is a centralized clearinghouse for all known export plugins.
Here you can find out a bit about each plugin and go directly to the Web site
for each plugin developer to download the required plugin files. Read the
installation instructions provided by the plugin developers to ensure you
have all the required files and put them in the right location. 
While some plugins are free, others may require a fee. These are all devel-
oped by parties outside of Adobe so there will be some variation in both cost
and functionality. Read the developer’s instructions carefully.
After you’ve downloaded a plugin or two you can return to the Plug-in
Manager dialog box to enable the plugins to work with Lightroom. Here are
the steps to add the Export to Flickr plugin I mentioned earlier:
1. In the Plug-in Manager dialog box, click the Add button.
This launches the Add Lightroom Plug-in dialog box.
2. Using the Add Lightroom Plugin dialog box, navigate to the folder
where you saved the plugins you downloaded.
In the case of the Flickr plugin (and many others) you will be instructed
to save them to the following location (depending upon your operating
system):
Mac
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/
Lightroom/Modules
XP
\Documents and Settings\username\Application
Data\Adobe\Lightroom\Modules
Vista
\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Lightroom\
Modules
3. Select the plugin.
Lightroom plugins have a .lrplugin file extension.
4. Click the Add Plug-in button on the Add Lightroom Plug-in dialog box.
Doing so returns you to the Plug-in Manager where you will see that your
plugin has been added successfully (refer to Figure 10-14).
5. Repeat the steps if you have additional plugins to add and click the
Done button when finished to close the Plugin Manager.
After you’ve added all your plugins, you’ll be able to access your installed
plugins from the Export Selected Photos To drop-down menu. Enjoy!

Producing a Slideshow
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the interface
 Developing a slideshow workflow
 Using templates
 Creating custom slideshows
 Showing your work
T
he Slideshow module offers a flexible interface for creating simple, yet
professional, presentations of your photos. Slideshows aren’t only useful
for sharing your images with clients, peers, family, and friends, but they can
also be a practical tool for reviewing your own work. You have relatively few
settings to configure, and the changes update in the main workspace area
while you work, so you’ll be displaying your images in no time at all!
You can create a slideshow from any grouping of images you
can dream of pulling together. Whether it’s a folder, a col-
lection, or an on-the-fly assemblage of images based on
dates, keywords, and/or metadata, if you can group
them, you can show them. You don’t need to be in
the Slideshow module to play a slideshow either.
Press Ctrl+Enter (Ô+Enter on a Mac) from within
any module to run an impromptu slideshow, which
uses the last configured settings from the Slideshow
module to run a show with the active images.
Exploring the Slideshow Module
An important point that bears repeating: The consistency of
Lightroom’s interface across modules is a key strength as a workflow tool.
That’s true as far as it goes — otherwise, I wouldn’t say it — but be aware
that each module performs a unique set of tasks, which means that each
module requires a specialized set of panels, tools, and menus. You have to be
acquainted with each set. (Don’t worry too much — I help acquaint you to
the Slideshow module’s particular set in the next few sections.)

232
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Getting to know the panels and tools
Before showing you around the Slideshow module, I want to remind you that
you can show/hide and collapse/expand panels as needed to maximize your
work area and display only the controls you need. Refer back to Chapter 1 for
a complete rundown of the interface controls.
Okay, time to dive in! The left panel contains the organizational and preview
panels; whereas, the right panel is where the adjusting, tweaking, and modifi-
cation panels are found. Each module has its own specialized toolbar, but the
images always take center stage. Here’s a brief introduction to the Slideshow
interface, as shown in Figure 11-1:
 Menu bar: Contains both the applicationwide commands as well as
module-specific menu options.
 Preview panel: Displays a preview of each slideshow’s layout while you
move your cursor over the templates listed in the Template Browser.
 Template Browser: This Template Browser (or template organizer)
is where you find the preinstalled templates as well as all your saved
templates. 
 Collections panel: Provides access to all the collections (think of them
as virtual folders) you’ve created in the past as well as the controls to
add new ones that retain the slideshow settings. Refer to Chapter 5 for a
Collections refresher, if needed.
 Export JPEG and Export PDF buttons: These buttons provide an alter-
nate output option for your slideshow. The JPEG button saves your
slideshow as a series of JPEG images, while the PDF button creates a
single PDF document. Neither option includes Intro Screen, Ending
Screen, or music.
 Filmstrip: Shows the thumbnails of the image grouping you’re working
with. Can be used to choose which images appear in the slideshow,
and in certain cases, you can use it to rearrange their order of appear-
ance. (I discuss the specifics of reordering in the section “Creating a
Slideshow.”)
 Options panel: Controls the look of the photo’s border and drop
shadow, and how the photo appears within the layout guides.
 Layout panel: The settings in this panel determine the size and location
of the photos on the slide.
 Overlays panel: Controls the look of the overlay elements (such as iden-
tity plate, text, and ratings) that you can add to enhance a slideshow.
 Backdrop panel: This is where you configure the look of the backdrop,
which is the part of the slide not covered by the photos.

 Titles panel: Allows you to add optional intro and/or ending slides to
your slideshow. This provides a nice finishing touch to any slideshow.
 Playback panel: The place where you add music, configure slide timing,
and can randomize playback order.
 Preview and Play buttons: The Preview button plays the slideshow
within the Content area, while the Play button controls the start of the
full screen show.
 Content area: Displays a live preview of the active image (or the most
selected image) within the slide layout. I’m the first to admit that “most
selected image” sounds rather odd at first, but in Lightroom parlance, it
means that if you have multiple images selected (or highlighted) in the
Filmstrip, you still need to select one of them to display in the content
area. This most selected image is highlighted more brightly than the
other less-selected images, as you can see in Figure 11-1.
 Toolbar: Contains the controls for navigation, designating which photos
to use in the show, playback, rotating the overlay elements, and the
addition of text overlays.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Becoming familiar with the menu options
The File, Edit, View, Window, and Help menus remain largely consistent
throughout Lightroom. The menu commands unique to the Slideshow
module are related to creation and playback:
 Slideshow menu: Here you find the commands for creating new tem-
plates and template folders, exporting a slideshow to PDF or JPEG,
adding text overlays, and rotating an image within the slide. The Save
Slideshow Settings allows you to save the current settings temporarily
without having to create a template. You can then select a template or
change settings, and use the Revert Slideshow Settings command to
return to your saved state.
 Play menu: Contains commands for playing, ending, and navigating
within a slideshow. The Content command provides the option to
choose which photos within the active image grouping end up being
displayed in the show.
Creating a Slideshow
Your photos, your intended audience, your reason for showing these images,
and your own creativity drive the look of your slideshow. Some questions you
want to think about before you begin are
 Who is my intended audience?
 What image order will make the most sense and impact?
 Is there any supporting information (such as captions, titles, camera-
generated data like f-stop and shutter speed, and so on) that will make
this presentation stronger or more targeted to this audience?
 How much time do I have?
 Would the addition of an audio component make this slideshow stronger?
With that in mind and knowing that new questions will emerge, you can enter
your slideshow workflow on the right footing.

Employing a slideshow workflow
Lightroom is all about workflows. To me, workflows are ways to build efficien-
cies into the repetitive tasks required to reach a desired outcome. Creating a
slideshow presentation is no different. The creation of every slideshow fol-
lows the same basic steps. Here’s an overview of the process:
1. Bring your photos to the Slideshow module.
2. Select a template for your starting point.
3. Customize the slideshow as desired.
4. (Optional) Save your settings as a template for reuse.
5. (Optional) Save your settings and photos as a special slideshow
collection.
I’ll cover this Saving as a Collection business in great detail later in the
chapter, but for now I just want to say that this is a new feature in
Lightroom 2 that allows you to bundle photos and settings in a special
type of module-specific collection. This is great if you want to save multi-
ple slideshow versions for a given group of photos with the bonus of
having quick access from the Collections panel.
The next few sections take a closer look at each of these steps in the process.
I bring it home at the end with a soup to nuts example of how I built a
slideshow layout I use all the time.
Step 1: Bring your photos to the Slideshow module
The Library module is your organizational hub. You’ve already spent time
putting photos into a folder structure, embedding them with keywords, and
organizing them into collections. (Check out Chapter 5 for a refresher on
these special virtual folders.) You have an array of camera-generated meta-
data that can also be used to refine your image groupings further. Figure 11-2
shows how photos can be assembled from many places. All these options are
accessible from the Library module, and that’s why the first step in slideshow
creation starts there.
235
Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

236
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 11-2: An image grouping using a single keyword spanning multiple folders.
One of the best ways to begin the slideshow process is to use (or create) a
collection because it can contain photos from every corner of your portfolio.
A collection is Lightroom’s way of providing an alternate method to group
photos, regardless of what folder the original photo resides in, which means
you can think of them as a kind of virtual folder. Any single photo can be
placed into an infinite number of collections, but the original photo can only
be in a single folder. The other benefits of using a collection are
 You can manually control the order the images appear in the slideshow.
You can only do a manual sort when you’re working within either a
single folder or a single collection. So, if you manually want to sort
images that are across a range of folders (or collections), you first need
to put them into a single collection and then sort. Lightroom refers to
this sort order as User Order. After you either are in a single folder or in
a collection, be sure to grab the image itself, not the border, and drag
and drop in the order you desire. You can do this from the Grid view of
the Library module or from the Filmstrip in any module (see Figure 11-3).
Refer to Chapter 5 for more on this sort option.

 A connection is formed between the collection and the slideshow tem-
plate you employ so that each time you bring that collection to the
Slideshow module, that template will be active.
 You can create an infinite number of collections and sort them indepen-
dently of each other.
With your photos in hand (so to speak), bring them into the Slideshow module.
Press Ctrl+Alt+3 (Ô+Option+3 on a Mac) to jump over to Slideshow (or click
Slideshow in the Module Picker). Notice the image grouping you created in the
Library module is displayed in the Filmstrip of the Slideshow module.
If needed, you can further refine your image grouping with the filtering
options provided in the Filmstrip. For example, you could filter your grouping
to only images with a rating of three stars or greater by going to the Filter
controls above the thumbnails and clicking the third star shown. The other
filtering options (flags, color labels, and copy status) work the same way.
Filters are very helpful, but sometimes you can easily forget that one’s been
applied. If you find yourself thinking that Lightroom has “lost” some photos
you “knew” were there before, press Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac) or click the Filter
button at the end of the Filmstrip to toggle the filter on and off, and see if
they reappear.
Figure 11-3: Manually sorting images within a collection from the Filmstrip.

Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

238
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Step 2: Select a template for your starting point
A Lightroom template is simply a way of saving unique combinations of set-
tings for reuse. The preinstalled templates are helpful for seeing possibilities
but also serve as great jumping off points for creating your own custom
slideshows. You can see a thumbnail layout of any template in the Preview
panel by moving your cursor over its name. The five preinstalled templates,
as shown in Figure 11-4, are listed under the Lightroom Templates heading.
Here are the key settings used in each:
 Caption and Rating: Displays the contents of the Caption field from
each image’s metadata as well as its star rating (if applied).
 Crop to Fill: Layout guides are maximized to fill the screen and the
Zoom to Fill Frame option is enabled (I go over this setting in the next
section), which results in images displayed full screen.
 Default: Makes use of an identity plate (a personalized graphic or text
element) and a text overlay to display the image’s filename.
 Exif Metadata: Also includes an identity plate but adds several text over-
lays, which display creator and capture data pulled from each file’s EXIF
metadata — the information recorded with each photo by the camera,
as in f-stop, shutter speed, etc.
 Widescreen: The layout guides are maximized to fill the screen, but the
Zoom to Fill Frame option is disabled, so images are resized to fit within
the layout frame without being cropped or distorted. 
Figure 11-4: The Template Browser and Preview panel displaying the Default template.

After you select a template to start with, you can hide the Left Panel Group to
increase the size of the content area by clicking the arrow on the left-most
edge of the Left Panel Group or by pressing F7. You can hide the top panel
containing the Module Picker for the time being as well by pressing F5.
Step 3: Customize the slideshow as desired
The right side panels are where the rubber meets the road when customizing
your slideshow. The panels are arranged with an efficient workflow in mind,
so start at the top and work your way down.
I like to reduce workspace clutter by collapsing all the right-side panels
except the one I’m using. Lightroom has a Solo Mode option that makes this a
snap. Here’s how to enable it:
1. Right-click (Option+click on a Mac) any panel header.
2. Choose Solo Mode from the pop-up contextual menu.
When Solo Mode is enabled, you can only have one panel expanded at a time.
As soon as you click another panel header to expand it, the currently opened
panel collapses. This reduces the need to keep scrolling down to reach the
lower panels. Lightroom provides a visual cue that Solo Mode is enabled by
changing the arrow in the panel header from a solid to a dotted pattern. Use
the same steps to disable Solo Mode if you want to open more than one panel
simultaneously. Alternatively, hold the Alt key (Option on a Mac) and click a
panel header to toggle Solo Mode on/off.
In the beginning of this chapter, I give you a brief introduction to all the
panels but to get you up to speed on how you actually use them, I need to
drill down further. In the sections that follow, I go over all the controls found
within each panel.
Options panel
You find three controls in this panel, as shown in Figure 11-5. All three func-
tion independently of each other to determine the appearance of the photo
on the slide. Here’s what they do:
239
Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

240
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 11-5: The Options panel.
 Zoom to Fill Frame: When the Zoom to Fill Frame option is enabled, the
aspect ratio of your images is ignored in favor of the frame created by
the layout guides (see the following “Layout panel” section). In other
words, photos appear zoomed in and cropped if they don’t have the
same aspect ratio as the frame. With this option disabled, the aspect
ratio of each image is respected, and the image is sized to fit within the
frame accordingly. Figures 11-6 and 11-7 show the difference this setting
can have on the same portrait-oriented image.
With Zoom to Fill Frame enabled, all photos are centered in the image area
and zoomed until the frame area is filled edge to edge. If a photo appears
cropped, you can adjust its position within the frame by clicking and drag-
ging the image to reposition. To aid with repositioning, Lightroom displays
a white outline of the photo’s edge that falls outside the frame.
Stroke Border: A stroke border can be used to set the image off the back-
ground. Check the box to enable the stroke and then click the color swatch
to choose a stroke color. The width of the stroke can range from 1–20
pixels. Note: The stroke appears inside the layout frame, so increasing the
width of the stroke results in decreasing the size of the photo.

Cast Shadow: The ability to add a drop shadow to each image is another
way to set it off from the background. You can adjust the shadow’s visi-
bility with the Opacity setting, its distance from the photo with the
Offset setting, the hardness of its edges with the Radius setting, and its
direction with the Angle setting. Note: The drop shadow can appear out-
side the layout frame, so if the layout frame goes to the edge of the slide,
a shadow may not be visible.

241
Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

242
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Layout panel
Use the controls in the Layout panel to determine the size and placement of
the photos on the slide by adjusting the left, right, top, and bottom guides.
The guides create the frame that defines the area within which the photos
appear, and are easier to adjust when visible. Click the Show Guides box or
press Ctrl+Shift+H (Ô+Shift+H on a Mac) to toggle their visibility on and off.
In Figure 11-8, the guides are visible. Note: They never appear when the
slideshow is playing.
Figure 11-8: The Layout panel.
Guides can be adjusted in tandem or individually, depending upon the configu-
ration of which link boxes (the white square buttons next to each guide) are
enabled. For example, you could link just the Top and Bottom guides together
and then unlink the Left and Right. This means that any adjustment to the Top
guide is mirrored in the Bottom, and the Left and Right are unaffected.
Here are the three different ways to adjust the guides:
 Click and drag the guide: When the cursor is placed over a guide in the
content area, it changes to a double-sided arrow. Click the guide and
drag to adjust its position.
 Use the sliders: Click and drag the sliders in the Layout panel to move
the guides in big increments. Place the cursor over the number field, and
it changes to a small, scrubby slider. Click and drag to move the guides
in small increments.

 Change the numbers: Double-click the number field and enter a pixel
amount. This number represents the distance in pixels from the edge of
the slide. When the number field is active, you can use the up- and
down-arrow keys to increase and decrease that number.
Overlays panel
Although photos should definitely
take center stage in a slideshow, you
still have a lot of room to add sup-
porting cast members, such as an
identity plate, rating stars, and text.
You can add and modify these sup-
porting elements in the Overlays
panel, as shown in Figure 11-9. Here’s
a closer look at each overlay element:
 Identity Plate: Identity plates
can be used to brand your
slideshows. Checking the
Identity Plate box causes the
default identity plate to appear
on the slide. You can reposition
the plate anywhere on the slide
by clicking and dragging it into
position. Note: When you drag
the identity plate across the
slide, you’ll notice anchor
points along the slide or guide
edges connecting to the nearest
Resize handle on the identity
plate, as shown in Figure 11-10.
These anchor points appear
with every overlay element and
can be a great help in aligning
elements on the slide.
You can choose a saved identity
plate or create a new one by
clicking the Identity Plate 
drop-down arrow. (Check out
Chapter 5 for more on creating
identity plates.) You can over-
ride the color of your identity
plate — without affecting the
saved identity plate — by
checking the Override Color
box and clicking the color
swatch to choose a new color.

Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

244
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 11-10: Anchor points aid in aligning overlay elements on the slide.
You can adjust the visibility of the identity plate with the Opacity slider.
This is a great way to turn your identity plate into a low-opacity water-
mark for exported slideshows.
Identity plates can be resized either by using either the Resize handles
on the object or the Scale slider. Checking the Render behind Image box
causes your identity plate to become a background element and display
behind the photo, stroke, and shadow.
 Rating Stars: Check the Rating Stars box to display the ratings overlay
element on the slide. Note: If you haven’t applied ratings, you won’t see
the rating element appear on the slide. (Stands to reason, right?) You
can apply a rating to the active image while in the Slideshow module
by pressing your 1–5 number keys respectively (even while the slideshow
is playing).
You can change the color of the rating stars by clicking the color swatch.
The Opacity and Scale sliders work the same as for the identity plate,
and the element can be repositioned similarly as well.
 Text Overlays: Although there can be only one identity plate and rating
element per slide, you can use any number of text-overlay elements in
your presentation. Figure 11-11 shows a filename, a date, and a custom
text element in use.

Figure 11-11: Multiple text overlay elements in use.
You can add a new text overlay by clicking the ABC button in the
Toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+T (Ô+T on a Mac). After the overlay appears
on the slide, you can configure the textual content from the Toolbar by
clicking the ABC drop-down menu and selecting an existing text tem-
plate or choosing Edit from the bottom of the menu to create your own
text template with the Text Template Editor. (Refer to Chapter 12 for a
step by step example of the Text Template Editor.) If you choose the
Custom Text template, an input field appears on the Toolbar. Just enter
your text and press Enter. 
Any Text Overlay you add is going to appear on every slide. If you want
the contents of the Text Overlay to change with each photo, then choose
a text template that displays the title, caption, or some other informa-
tion that is pulled dynamically from each photo’s own metadata.
Because multiple text overlays can be used in a slideshow, they each
need to be adjusted independently of each other. After you select a text
element, the dotted border and Resize handles appear. You can then
adjust the text element’s color, opacity, and font via the controls in the
Overlays panel. Text elements can be resized only via the Resize handles
and are repositioned in the same manner as the other overlay elements.
To remove any overlay, select it and press Delete.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 Shadow: Before getting into how this setting works, I need to point out
this is one of the few areas where there’s a difference between the Mac
and Windows versions of Lightroom. If you’re a Windows user, you won’t
see the Shadow section in the Overlays panel (sorry!), but you can look
at Figure 11-12 to see what it looks like. I hope the engineers can over-
come whatever operating system obstacle stands in the way of including
this on Windows in a future version. Windows users can feel free to skip
ahead to the next section.
The purpose of this control is to add a drop shadow to an overlay element.
You enable the Shadow option by first clicking an overlay element to make
it active and then checking the Shadow box. While the overlay element is
active, you can adjust the opacity, offset, radius, and angle of the drop
shadow in the same manner as the Cast Shadow control in the Options
panel. Note: The opacity setting of the overlay element also affects the
opacity of the element’s shadow, so if the element itself has a low opacity
setting, you’ll need a high-shadow opacity setting to see the shadow.
Figure 11-12: Shadow control in Overlays panel on Mac only.
Backdrop panel
A good background supports and frames your photos but doesn’t compete
with them. The Backdrop panel, as shown in Figure 11-13, offers three ways
to adjust the look of the area behind your photos. I don’t mind telling you
that I wish the controls were arranged differently, and after I show you how
to use them, I think you’ll agree.

Here’s how the controls work in the
order I use them:
 Background Color: Check the
Background Color box to enable
it and click the color swatch to
choose a color. Keep in mind
that your perception of color is
influenced by surrounding
colors. Because of this, you’ll
see black or neutral gray as the
most common background
color choices. Of course, you
can use any color you wish if
that’s what fits with your goals
for a particular audience. Know
the rules and then break them
when it suits you!
 Background Image: As an alter-
native, you can add a back-
ground image to the slide.
Check the Background Image
box to enable it and then drag a
photo from the Filmstrip to
either the slide background or
the Background Image box in
the Background panel, as shown
in Figure 11-14. After the back-
ground image is in place, you
can adjust its opacity via the
slider. Note: When you decrease
the opacity of the background
image, the background color increasingly shows through. Different back-
ground colors affect your background image in different ways.
 Color Wash: Each of the earlier options can be further enhanced by
applying a color wash, which is why I use this control last. You use it to
add an additional color, in the form of a gradient, across the back-
ground. You can adjust the opacity and angle of the gradient wash via
the respective controls.
As you can see, these controls can be used alone or in tandem to offer an
almost unlimited variety of creative background possibilities!

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 11-14: Adding a background image to the slide.
Titles panel
A welcome addition to Lightroom 2, the Titles panel, as shown in Figure 11-15,
offers a simple bit of polish to your slideshow presentation by providing a
means to add a nonphoto beginning and ending screen to your show. The
Intro Screen appears before the first photo slide and the Ending Screen
appears after the last photo slide. These screens are entirely optional and
function independently of each other — meaning you can add an Intro without
an Ending and vice versa. The Titles panel is divided into two sections, with
the Intro options on top and Ending options on bottom. However, the type of
controls for each screen are the same:
 Enable Screen check box: Each screen type is enabled by checking the
box at the top of each section.
 Color swatch: Click the color swatch to set the color of that screen.
 Add Identity Plate check box: Check this box to add an identity plate
to either screen. This is the only means to add text or a graphic to that
screen. 
 Choose/Create Identity Plate: After you’ve enabled the identity plate
you can choose to use an existing one or create a new one specifically
for this purpose.

 Override Color: This control allows you to override the actual color of a
textual identity plate without having to alter the identity plate itself. In
other words, if you have a custom identity plate that uses black text, but
want to add it to a black Intro screen, you can simply override the origi-
nal color with this option and change it to white without affecting your
custom identity plate. Make sense?
 Scale: This adjusts the size of the identity plate.
Figure 11-15: The Titles panel.
Playback panel
Okay, one more aspect of the Slideshow module behaves differently on a Mac
than on Windows: how a soundtrack is applied. Lightroom on the Mac inte-
grates tightly with iTunes, and Windows doesn’t. Mac users can assign any
iTunes playlist to a slideshow (music, podcast, even streaming Internet
radio!); Windows users can only assign a folder containing MP3 files (yes,
MP3 only). Time to take a closer look at each option in the Playback panel:
 Soundtrack: Check the Soundtrack box to enable it and then
• On a Mac, click the drop-down menu and choose an iTunes
playlist, as shown in Figure 11-16.
• On Windows, click the Click Here to Choose a Music Folder link, as
shown in Figure 11-17, and then navigate to a folder containing the
MP3 files you want to accompany the slideshow. 
249
Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

250
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 11-16: Selecting an iTunes playlist on a Mac.
Figure 11-17: Selecting a music folder on Windows.

On either Mac or Windows, if
you have more than one song in
your playlist or folder (respec-
tively) and the slideshow dura-
tion exceeds the length of the
first song, the next song begins
playing. If the music ends before
the slideshow completes, well,
you’ll have a quiet ending. You
can’t synchronize the slideshow
to the length of the song in
Lightroom, so you have to set
the duration of the show to
match the music you select.
 Playback Screen: If you don’t
see Figure 11-18 in your
Playback panel, it just means
you only have one monitor
hooked up to your computer.
For those of you with multiple
monitors, Lightroom lets you
choose which monitor to run
the slideshow on. Click the icon
representing your monitor
choice, and the Play symbol
appears on the icon. Check the
Blank Other Screens check box
to black out the screen not run-
ning the show.
 Slide Duration: Unless you have
a one-photo slideshow (not
likely!), check the Slide Duration
box to set the slide duration
and transition timing. The Slides
slider controls how long each
photo displays, and the Fades
slider controls the duration of
the transition from one photo
to the next. The Color check
box and associated color swatch is a cool feature! When enabled, each
slide will fade to that color and then to the next slide, as opposed to
simply fading from one slide to the next. I find that adding a color fade
keeps the presentation cleaner because it avoids that moment when two
photos are partially faded into each other. Try it and you’ll see.

 Random Order: Enabling this option causes your photos to appear ran-
domly in the slideshow.
 Repeat: Check this box if you want your slideshow to keep repeating in a
continuous loop, or leave it unchecked to have it stop on either the last
photo slide or the Ending Screen, if enabled.
Step 4: Save your settings as a template for reuse
You don’t need to rely solely on the pre-installed templates after you get your
feet wet. As you begin to customize slideshows to your liking, I recommend
saving your preferred settings as templates. Here’s how:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+N (Ô+Shift+N on a Mac) to create a new template folder.
Alternatively, you can go to Slideshow➪New Template Folder. Then all
you have to do is give the folder a descriptive name and click the Create
button.
Keeping your templates organized can increase your efficiency by provid-
ing order to your template collection. The Template Browser displays tem-
plate folders and individual templates in alphanumeric order, right below
the Lightroom Templates heading. To keep my starter template folder at
the top of the list, I name it with a number, as shown in Figure 11-19. Note:
You can’t create template folders within folders.
2. Press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac) to create a new template from the set-
tings you’ve specified.
Alternatively, you can go to Slideshow➪New Template. Give the tem-
plate a descriptive name, assign it to your desired folder, and click the
Create button.
Figure 11-19: Creating a new template folder.

Step 5: Save your photos and settings as a special module collection
I briefly went over collections earlier, but these special collections require a
little more explanation. Lightroom 2 brought with it a fundamental change in
how collections can be structured, as well as some additional functionality.
Let me explain by focusing on what you can do now. Figure 11-20 shows the
Collections panel. The Collections panel, designed to put all of your collections
within easy reach (almost) everywhere you are, is now a standard feature in all
areas of Lightroom except the Develop module. 
Figure 11-20: The Collections panel.
When you want to keep a group of collections together, you must put them in a
collection set. I am in the practice of creating a new collection set when I am in
the process of sorting photos after import (which I cover in Chapter 5), but you
can create new sets as you need them using the + symbol in the Collections
panel header and choosing Create Collection Set. (Previously you could group
collections under existing collections, but this is no longer possible.)
Along with the addition of the Collections panel came a new module-specific
type of collection. (There is one for Library, Slideshow, Web, and Print.) You
can only create a module collection from inside each respective module.
Each collection type has its own icon (refer to Figure 11-20 to see one of
each). Here’s what makes them special:
 The module collection retains all the settings configured in that
module from the last time that collection was in use.
253
Chapter 11: Producing a Slideshow

254
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 You can create multiple module collections that each use different
settings.
 Double-clicking the collection icon automatically brings you to that
module with that collection of photos with all the settings associated
with it.
So, while module collections are optional, I think you’ll find that they can be
a great tool for organizing and accessing your photos. Here are the steps for
creating a module collection that will be associated with the current module
settings:
1. Click the + symbol in the Collections panel header and choose Create
Slideshow.
Doing so launches the Create Slideshow dialog box.
2. Enter a descriptive name in the Name field.
3. (Optional) Click the Set drop-down menu to add it to an existing set.
I strongly recommend that you use collection sets to keep your collec-
tions organized. 
Putting it all together
As promised, I close this section by walking you through a practical example.
Here’s a useful layout for those situations when you want to export the
slideshow as a PDF or a collection of JPEG images to hand off to another
party. This example is simple and clean, while providing watermark protec-
tion and identifying each photo by filename. Here are the steps you need to
take to customize your slideshow so it looks like what you see in Figure 11-21:
Figure 11-21: Customized slideshow template.

1. Select the Default template from the Template Browser.
I recommend maximizing your workspace and reducing panel clutter as
much as possible while you work. To that end, press F to jump to full
screen mode, press F5 to hide the Module Picker, and then press F7 to
hide the left panel.
2. Expand the Options panel and use the Stroke Border slider to increase
the border to 5 pixels.
3. Click the Stroke color swatch and set it to pure white.
Leave the other Options panel settings as is.
4. Expand the Layout panel and click the link boxes for the Top and
Bottom guides to unlink them.
The default here is to have them linked, so clicking unlinks them. You
just want to be able to adjust the bottom guide without affecting the
Top. The Left and Right guides can remain as is.
5. Click and drag the Bottom guide up until its distance from the edge is
at least two times greater than the Top guide is from the top edge.
You can also eyeball this amount until you think it looks good.
6. Expand the Overlays panel and then click and drag the Identity Plate
element over the center of the photo.
As part of the Default template, the default identity plate will already be
on-screen. I suggest customizing it to fit your needs. I used the copyright
symbol with my name, set to white, to create a simple styled text identity
plate. Note: The keyboard shortcut for the copyright symbol on Windows
involves holding the Alt key, using the numeric keypad to type 0169, and
then releasing the Alt key. On a Mac, just hold the Option key and press G.
7. Scale the identity plate to 40 percent.
8. Reduce the opacity of the identity plate to 50–60 percent.
The goal is to use the identity plate as a watermark, so use an opacity
level that you feel best protects the image without interfering with view-
ing the image too much.
9. Click and drag the Filename text overlay right under the photo.
The Default template already included this text overlay, so all you need
to do is reposition it.
10. Expand the Backdrop panel and disable the color wash.
11. Click the Background color swatch and set it to a light gray.
The goal is to have it just gray enough to set off the pure white stroke
around the photo.
12. Press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac) to save these settings as a new template.
At this point, your slideshow matches Figure 11-21, and you have a new tem-
plate in your Template Browser. Well done!

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Playing the Slideshow for Your Audience
Showtime! Now, before you head onstage to show your work, do a few dress
rehearsals to check your timing and make sure everything flows as it should.
The Slideshow module relies upon the standard-sized previews that Lightroom
creates after import. If Lightroom is still in the process of generating previews
for the photos in your slideshow, you may experience problems running the
show. You can force the generation of standard-sized previews and then wait
for the progress meter to complete before running the show. Here’s how:
1. Press G to jump to Grid view in the Library module.
2. Press Ctrl+A (Ô+A on a Mac) to select all photos in your show.
3. Choose Library➪Previews➪Render Standard-Sized Previews.
4. Wait for the progress meter to complete and then switch back to the
Slideshow module.
Playback
After you finalize the look and feel of your slideshow, as well as the number
of photos you’ll show, expand the Playback panel (refer to Figure 11-18) and
configure the following:
 Slide Duration
 (Optional) Music
 (Optional) Playback Screen
For that rare instance when you want to randomize the order of the
slideshow (hey, it could happen), I’ll remind you that that particular option is
there, but it isn’t likely to see much use.
The real choices here are Music and Slide Duration. You want them to work
together. You want people to be able to see each photo, take it in, and be
ready to move on when the next transition occurs. You also want the pace of
the music to match the pace of the show. The duration of the show should
also fit with the duration of the music. Keep in mind that you can adjust the
slide duration in tenth-of-a-second increments to help you fine-tune the
timing between your show and that perfect music selection.
If you’re not adding music — and that’s fine — you can just focus on finding
that right amount of time for displaying each photo.
To aid you in test-driving your show, Lightroom can play the show right
within the content area. Click the Preview button below the Playback panel.
You’ll hear the music (if enabled) and see the show just as it would play if

you had it full screen, but you can also watch the progression of photos in
the Filmstrip. Consider this a preflight check to ensure you’re ready for prime
time. Click the content area or press Esc to stop the preview.
If you have a dual monitor setup, you get to choose which monitor you want
to run the show on by selecting its icon in the Playback panel. If you only
have a single monitor setup, the choice is made for you.
To start the show, click the Play button, sit back, and enjoy!
There are three keyboard shortcuts worth memorizing for running a
slideshow:
 Press Enter to start the show.
 Press Spacebar to pause the show.
 Press Esc to quit the show. 
Export
Having options is nice. When you can’t bring your computer to your audience
or your audience to your computer, you can send your slideshow to your
audience. Lightroom’s Export function can save your slideshow to either a
series of JPEG files or a single multipage PDF file. The good news is that
anyone with a simple image viewer can see JPEGs, and the free Adobe
Acrobat Reader is in such wide use almost anyone can view a PDF. The bad
news is that music isn’t included in the export, and the transition times are
fixed. Here are the steps to export your show to PDF:
1. Click the Export PDF button at the bottom of the Left Panel Group.
The Export Slideshow to PDF dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-22.
2. In the Save In drop-down menu, navigate to the location on your com-
puter where you want the file saved.
3. Enter a name in the File Name field.
4. Choose a quality setting for the JPG compression applied to each slide.
The higher the quality setting, the less JPG compression, which results
in a better-looking image but a larger file size.
5. Choose the Width and Height of the exported file.
This value should be based on the resolution of the monitor the presen-
tation will be viewed on. If you’ve been working on a widescreen monitor
with a 16:9 aspect ratio but are sending this to someone with a 4:3 dis-
play, the slide won’t fill the entire screen when played. Instead, slide will
be letter boxed, just like when you try to watch a widescreen movie on
your standard TV screen.
257

6. Check the Automatically Show Full Screen box.
When the PDF file is opened, it displays full screen and begins the
slideshow. Warn the people you deliver the file to that this will happen
so they know what to expect. Also, tell them to press the Esc key to exit
when they’re done.
7. Click the Save button.
Figure 11-22: The Export Slideshow to PDF dialog.
When Lightroom’s progress meter is complete, the file is ready to test
(always test everything). If you’re sending via e-mail, check the final output
size of the PDF and resave with either higher JPG compression and/or smaller
pixel dimensions if the file is too large.
The Export to JPEG functions essentially the exact same way (right down to
the dialog box) with one logical difference; there is no Automatically Show
Full Screen box. With the Export JPEG function Lightroom simply saves each
slide out as a separate JPEG file. How they are viewed depends on what appli-
cation the viewer opens them with. These files display equally well in the
standard Windows Picture and Fax viewer as they do in Mac’s standard
Preview application or any application that opens JPEGs.

t’s an online world these days. High speed Internet and digital photography
go together like peanut butter and chocolate. Lightroom’s Web module
offers a diverse range of photo gallery styles and configurations for creating
professional-looking galleries without touching a bit of HTML code. Seamless
integration between your portfolio and Lightroom’s built-in FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) software means you can take your photos from import to
Web gallery to Web server in a matter of minutes!
Just like a slideshow, you can create a Web gallery from
any grouping of images you can pull together in the
Library module. You can start from a folder, keyword
search, metadata browse, or collection. If you can
group them, you can put them on the Web!
Exploring the Web Module
If you’ve been reading this book from the start, you
might be tired of hearing it by now (but at least you
won’t forget), but each Lightroom module is structured
essentially the same way to make your workflow more effi-
cient. Here’s the benefit from this consistency: The interface
behaves the same way no matter where you are! You can show/hide and
collapse/expand panels as needed to maximize your work area, and only dis-
play the controls you need. To find out more about the Lightroom interface
as a whole, move it on over to Chapter 1.

260
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Getting to know the panels and tools
Figure 12-1 shows the Web module interface. The organizational and preview
panels are on the left side of the content area, the right side holds the config-
uration panels — the Filmstrip (across the bottom) and the Module Picker
(across the top) are consistent across all modules. Keep in mind that the only
elements that change from module to module are the tools and settings that
are specific to that module. Small comfort perhaps when first trying to take it
all in, but I’ll help guide you through each step of the way!
Figure 12-1: The Web module interface.
Time to take a closer look and see what’s here. Here’s an overview of all the
Web module components:
 Menu bar: Contains applicationwide commands as well as module-
specific menu options.
 Preview panel: Displays a preview of each template layout as you move
your cursor over the items listed in the Template Browser.
 Template Browser: Provides controls for creating new — and managing
existing — templates.

 Collections panel: Provides access to all the collections (think of them
as virtual folders) you’ve created in the past as well as the controls to
add new ones that retain the slideshow settings. Refer to Chapter 5 for a
Collections refresher if needed.
 Preview in Browser button: Click this button to display the current Web
configuration in your default Web browser.
 Filmstrip: Displays thumbnails of the active image grouping. It can be
used to reorder the photos if you’re working within a collection or single
folder.
 Engine panel: Lists installed Web galleries and is used to choose the
active gallery. The five preinstalled gallery types are
• Airtight AutoViewer: A gallery that displays in a horizontal strip.
Scrolls like a filmstrip.
• Airtight PostcardViewer: This gallery resembles a collection of pic-
ture postcards spread across a flat surface. Interactive and fun!
• Airtight SimpleViewer: Here you have a pretty simple layout using
thumbnails that control what image displays in the large view.
• Lightroom Flash Gallery: The original Flash-based gallery from
Adobe. Highly customizable.
• Lightroom HTML Gallery: The original HTML gallery from Adobe
that uses a thumbnail grid to link to larger versions.
 Site Info panel: Contains input fields for information about the gallery.
Options vary with each gallery.
 Color Palette panel: Allows for changing the color scheme of certain
gallery elements. Options vary with each gallery.
 Appearance panel: Configures attributes that affect the structural
appearance of each gallery type. Options vary with each gallery.
 Image Info panel: Allows you to display information about the images in
the gallery. Options vary with each gallery.
 Output Settings panel: Most galleries make use of a small thumbnail size
photo in combination with a larger version of the same photo. The main
option in this panel controls the output size settings of the larger ver-
sion. Other options vary with each gallery.
 Upload Settings panel: Configuration and storage of your FTP settings.
 Export button: Click this button to save all your gallery files to a loca-
tion on your disk.
 Upload button: Click this button to begin copying files to the Web server
you configured in the Upload Settings panel.

 Content area: Displays an updated and fully interactive preview of your
photos in the active gallery.
 Toolbar: Displays the name of the active gallery along with navigation
controls, the Use menu — for designating which photos to use in the
gallery — and the name of the gallery type being used.
As noted above, the contents of the Site Info, Color Palette, Appearance,
Image Info, and Output Settings panels change as you change gallery types.
None of the Airtight galleries, for example, include the option to add the
copyright watermark to the photos. Granted, the copyright watermark fea-
ture is rather weak as watermarks go, but don’t drive yourself mad looking
for it in the galleries that don’t include it! 
Becoming familiar with the menu options
The File, Edit, View, Window, and Help menus remain largely consistent
throughout Lightroom. The one menu option that is unique to the Web
module is the aptly named Web menu. It contains commands for creating new
templates and template folders, reloading the content area (similar to
refreshing your Web browser), exporting the Web gallery, and previewing the
gallery in your browser. The Save Web Settings command allows you to save
the custom settings temporarily without having to create a template. You can
then select a template or change settings to compare, and use the Revert
Web Settings command to return to your saved state. The Content command
provides the option to choose which photos — within the active image
grouping — will display in the gallery. The About menu provides additional
functionality details and a Feature list regarding the active gallery type.
What’s the Difference between Flash and HTML?
Without getting bogged down in geek-speak, you probably need to have a
few things under your belt about the nature of the gallery types found in
Lightroom. The galleries fall into one of two flavors:
 HTML: Think static and linear. They can display in any browser without
any special plugins.
 Flash: Think fluid and interactive. They require the free (and nearly uni-
versal) Flash plugin to work.

Okay, those are pretty broad generalizations, but insofar as Lightroom is con-
cerned, the Flash galleries are far more fluid and interactive, while the HTML
gallery is kind of a static grid. Yes, I did say the HTML gallery; there’s only one
(it’s highly configurable though). The other four are all Flash driven.
While your cursor is over each template in the Template Browser, Lightroom
gives you a clue as to which gallery type you’re seeing in the Preview panel.
HTML galleries, as shown in Figure 12-2, display “HTML” in the lower-left
corner, while the Flash galleries, as shown in Figure 12-3, display a stylized
“F” in the same location. Note: The templates you make from Airtight gal-
leries (as well as other third-party developers) simply show a generic layout
preview of that gallery type.
Figure 12-2: HTML template preview.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 12-3: Flash template preview.
When Lightroom version 1.0 was released, you only had the Lightroom HTML
Gallery and the Lightroom Flash Gallery available to you. With the release of
version 1.3, the three galleries made by Airtight Interactive became welcome
additions to the program. In Chapter 14, I let you know where you can find
some additional galleries you can download and install.
Creating a Web Gallery
The look of your Web gallery is going to be driven by your photos, your
intended audience, the reason(s) you’re putting these images online, and your
own creativity. Some questions you want to think about before you begin are
 Who is my intended audience?
 What image order will make the most sense and impact?

 Is there any supporting information (such as filenames, titles, camera-
generated data like f-stop, etc.) that you want to add to this gallery?
 Does my audience have any technological limitations (bandwidth, moni-
tor resolution, browser preference, etc.) that would prevent them from
enjoying the Web gallery?
 Is a watermark required to protect my work?
With that in mind, and knowing that new questions will emerge, you can
enter into your Web gallery workflow on the right footing. 
Employing a Web gallery workflow
Lightroom is all about workflows within workflows! The creation of every
Web gallery follows the same basic steps. Here’s an overview of the process:
1. Bring your photos to the Web module.
2. Select a template or gallery type for your starting point.
3. Customize as desired.
4. (Optional) Save your settings as a template for reuse.
5. (Optional) Save your settings and photos as a special Web collection.
I’ll cover this in great detail later in the chapter, but this is a new feature
in Lightroom 2 that allows you to bundle photos and settings in a special
type of module-specific collection. This is great if you want to save multi-
ple Web gallery versions for a given group of photos with the bonus of
having quick access from the Collections panel.
The next few sections take a closer look at each step in the process. I follow
up by walking you through the creation of a gallery I find particularly useful.
Step 1: Bring your photos to the Web gallery module 
The Library module is your organizational hub. You’ve already spent time
putting photos into a folder structure, embedding them with keywords, and
organizing them into collections (refer to Chapter 5 for a refresher on these
special virtual folders). You have an array of camera-generated metadata that
can also be used to browse your portfolio. All these options are accessible
from the Library module, and that is why the first step in Web-gallery cre-
ation starts there.
265
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery

266
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
One of the best ways to begin the Web gallery process is to use a collection,
because it can contain photos from every corner of your imported portfolio.
The other benefits of using a collection are
 You can manually control the order the images appear in the Web gallery.
You can only do a manual sort when you’re working within either a single
folder or a single collection. So, if you want to sort images manually that
are across a range of folders (or collections), you first need to put them
into a single collection, then sort. Lightroom refers to this sort order as
User Order. After you’re in either a single folder or a collection, then be
sure to grab the image itself, not the border, and drag and drop in the
order you desire, as shown in Figure 12-4. You can drag and drop images
from the Grid view of the Library module or the Filmstrip in any module.
 A connection is formed between the collection and the Web gallery set-
tings you employ so that each time you bring that collection to the
Slideshow module, those settings will be active.
 You can create an infinite number of collections and sort them indepen-
dently of each other.
Figure 12-4: Manually sorting images within a collection from the Filmstrip.
After you’ve collected your photos for the gallery, it’s time to bring them into
the Web module. Press Ctrl+Alt+5 (Ô+Option+5 on a Mac) to jump over to
Web module (or click Web in the Module Picker). Notice the image grouping
you created in the Library module is still displayed in the Filmstrip. 
If needed, you can further refine your image grouping using the filtering
options provided in the Filmstrip. For example, you could filter your grouping
to only images with a rating of three stars or greater by clicking the third star
above the thumbnails. The other filtering options (flags, color labels, and
copy status) work the same way. 
Filters are very helpful, but sometimes it’s easy to forget that a filter has been
applied. If you find yourself thinking that Lightroom has “lost” some photos
you “knew” were there before, try pressing Ctrl+L (Ô+L on a Mac) or click the
Filter button at the end of the Filmstrip to toggle the filter on and off, and see
if the photos reappear.

Step 2: Select a template or gallery type for your starting point
A template is simply a way of saving unique combinations of settings for
reuse. The preinstalled templates are helpful for seeing possibilities, but also
serve as great jumping-off points for creating your own custom Web galleries.
You can see a thumbnail layout of any template in the Preview panel by
moving your cursor over its name. The preinstalled templates, as shown in
Figure 12-5, are listed under the Lightroom Templates heading. These tem-
plates are simply variations on either of the two default gallery types:
 Lightroom Flash Gallery
 Lightroom HTML Gallery
Figure 12-5: The Template Browser displaying the default template.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
When you’re finished with the Template Browser, you can hide the left panel
to increase the size of the content area by clicking the arrow in the center of
the left panel or by pressing F7. To reclaim additional space, you can hide the
Module Picker by pressing F5.
No templates are included in the Template Browser for the three Airtight gal-
leries, so to access them you need to expand the Engine panel, as shown in
Figure 12-6. Simply selecting the gallery type provides you with default set-
tings to work from and to create your own templates.
Figure 12-6: The Engine panel.
Step 3: Customize as desired
The controls for customizing your Web gallery are found on the right side of
the module. The panels are arranged with an efficient workflow in mind, so
start at the top and work your way down. 

I like to reduce workspace clutter by collapsing all the right-side panels except
the one I’m using. Lightroom has a Solo Mode option that makes this a snap.
Here’s how to enable it:
1. Right-click (Option+click on a Mac) any panel header.
2. Choose Solo Mode from the pop-up context menu.
When Solo Mode is enabled, you can have only one panel expanded at a time.
This means that as soon as you click another panel header to expand it, the
currently open panel will collapse. This reduces the need to keep scrolling to
reach the lower panels. Lightroom provides a visual cue that Solo Mode is
enabled by changing the arrow in the panel header from a solid to a dotted
pattern. Use the same steps to disable Solo Mode if you want to open more
than one panel simultaneously. Alternatively, hold the Alt key (Option on a
Mac) and click a panel header to toggle Solo Mode on/off.
A nice feature of the Engine panel is that when it’s collapsed, a drop-down
menu appears in the header, which enables you to switch between gallery
types without needing to expand that panel!
Okay, let’s roll up our sleeves and go through each panel in greater detail.
Site Info panel
The contents of the Site Info panel will depend on which gallery type you
choose. However, all galleries share the Site Title field shown in Figure 12-7.
This information is displayed in the title bar of Web browsers visiting your
site, and can be displayed within the content area of the gallery depending on
the gallery type you choose. 
Either you can enter the information into the fields in the panel, or you can
click the text you want to edit in the Content area and edit it right in the live
gallery preview!
269
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery

270
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 12-7: The Site Title field.

Only the Lightroom HTML and
Lightroom Flash galleries make use
of the following fields, as shown in
Figure 12-8:
 Collection Title: Think of this as
a subtitle for your site title.
 Collection Description: Enter a
description of the contents of
your gallery.
 Contact Info: This field works
hand in hand with the Web or
Mail Link field below it to create
a clickable link.
 Web or Mail Link: Enter the link
or mailto code to accompany
the data you entered for
Contact Info.
Although I did say at the start of this
chapter that you wouldn’t have to
touch “a bit of HTML code,” here is
one place you can. If you want to
create a link to another page from
your gallery, you use both the
Contact Info and the Web or Mail Link
fields to make it work. For example,
say I want to link this Web gallery to
my site’s home page, and I want that
link to display the following text,
“Home.” (Home is the text you would
click.) To get all that to work, I’d start
by entering Home into the Contact Info field. I would then enter the complete
link to my home page in the Web or Mail Link field, so I’d enter
http://www.myWebsite.com.
The other option is to create an e-mail link, which when clicked opens that
person’s e-mail program with a new message already addressed to me. This
works the same way. First, enter the text you want visitors to click, like Email
Me, in the Contact Info field, and then enter the mailto code (this is what tells
a Web browser to open the e-mail) followed by your e-mail address. It would
look like this:
mailto:me@myWebsite.com
271
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery
Figure 12-8: Common fields in the Site Info
panel.

272
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
The default text is formatted that way to remind you to always put mailto:
before the e-mail address.
Lightroom remembers text you’ve entered in each field and provides you
quick access to previous entries via the drop-down arrow above the field.
Only in the Lightroom HTML Gallery can you add an identity plate in addition
to the Site Title at the top of your page, as shown in Figure 12-9. You won’t
see this in the Site Info panel for any other gallery type. Note: That said, the
Lightroom Flash Gallery gives you the option to swap the Site Title field with
an identity plate, but the identity plate control is included in the Appearance
panel with that gallery. (I cover that in a bit.)
Figure 12-9: Identity plate added to the Lightroom HTML Gallery.

Check the box to enable the identity plate. You can choose an existing iden-
tity plate or create a new one. (Look at Chapter 5 for more about creating
identity plates.) The identity plate can be made into a clickable link by com-
pleting the Web or Mail Link field that displays below it.
Color Palette panel
As the name suggests, the Color
Palette panel holds the controls for
changing the color scheme of your
gallery. Figure 12-10 shows the Color
Palette panel for the HTML Gallery.
Note: The contents of this panel
changes based on the gallery type
selected, since each is unique.
Although the configurable elements
in each gallery type vary, the color
controls work the same way in each
instance.
Click the color chip corresponding
to the element you wish to change
to access Lightroom’s new-and-
improved color picker (it’s really
cool), as shown in Figure 12-11. You
can choose a color a number of ways:
 Enter HSL values: Uses the HSL
(Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
color model. You can enter
specific values by clicking
each H, S, or L field. Right-click
(Control+click on a Mac) the
color bar to switch between
HSL and HSB. (See the next
bullet for more on HSB.)
 Enter HSB values: Uses the HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color
model. You can enter specific values by clicking each H, S, or B field.
Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the color bar to switch between HSL
and HSB.
 Enter RGB values: Uses yet another color model — this time the RGB
(Red, Green, Blue) color model. You can enter specific values by clicking
each R, G, or B field.
 Enter Hexadecimal values: The numbers that are used in HTML for
defining color are commonly referred to as hex values. If you know the
hex values used on your Web site, click the word Hex; this changes the
RGB fields to a Hex field where you can enter the desired values.
273

274
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 Click a spot on the palette: You can also simply choose a color by click-
ing the bar and adjusting the saturation with the ramp slider.
 Eyedropper: By far the coolest option! Click the color chip, but do not
release the mouse button so that you keep the eyedropper active. Move
the eyedropper over any (and I mean any) area of your screen to select a
color. This is great for pulling colors right from your photos to create the
color palette for your gallery. While you move around the screen, you
see the color of the element you’re working on change. Release the
mouse button to select the color.
You can use the swatches along the top of the Color Picker to save colors you
like. Placing your cursor over each swatch displays a pop-up ToolTip
instructing you how to use that swatch. Close the Color Picker by clicking
back on the color chip in the Color Palette you selected to open it.
Figure 12-11: Color Picker. 
Appearance panel
The contents of this panel vary the most of any panel among the different
gallery types. As you can imagine, each gallery type has a set of controls to
alter its appearance. Figure 12-12 shows the Appearance panel for the
Lightroom HTML Gallery.
Despite the differences in the controls for each gallery, they’re all rather
straightforward in their purpose — that you immediately see your adjust-
ment’s affects on the active gallery. For example, if you add more cells to the
HTML gallery, the live preview automatically updates, or if you increase the

photo borders in the AutoViewer, the gallery rebuilds itself before your eyes.
Note: In the case of the Lightroom HTML Gallery, the controls in the Image
Page section affect the page that displays the large version of the image. Click
a thumbnail in the content area to switch to an Image Page to see the effects
of the controls.
Figure 12-12: The Appearance panel for the HTML gallery.

Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Image Info panel
This panel is where you find controls
for adding a caption and title to go
with the large image in your gallery.
Figure 12-13 shows the Image Info
panel for the Lightroom Flash and
HTML gallery types. Note: The
Airtight galleries only offer the abil-
ity to add a caption.
The main difference between Title
and Caption is where they’re located
in each gallery (Title is always
higher). You can display any type of
textual information in either ele-
ment. Here’s how to add a caption:
1. Check the Caption box.
2. Click the drop-down menu
and either choose one of the
text templates listed or choose
Edit to create a custom text
template.
After you choose a template, it immediately displays in the gallery. Note:
Caption and Title only appear when viewing the large version of the
photo, so if you’re viewing the HTML grid, you won’t see them until you
click a photo to get to the large version.
While helpful Title and Caption text templates come with Lightroom, I strongly
suggest taking a dive into the Text Template Editor to create custom templates
that might better suit your needs. Here’s how to create a text template that
displays the camera model and lens used:
1. Choose Edit from the Caption drop-down menu.
Doing so launches the Text Template Editor, as shown in Figure 12-14.
2. Select and then delete any text tokens that appear in the Editor window.
This allows you to start with a clean slate.
3. Choose Model from the top drop-down menu in the EXIF Data section.
The Model token appears in the Editor window. Notice that the Example
preview above the window shows you the contents of the token.
4. Click in front of the token to insert your cursor there and enter
Camera: followed by a space.
Yes, you can type right in the Editor window! This is great for adding text
as part of the template.
Figure 12-13: The Image Info panel.

5. Click behind the Model token to insert your cursor there and enter a
space followed by Lens: and another space.
6. Choose Lens from the same drop-down menu as before.
The Lens token should appear in the Editor window at the end of the
existing text.
7. Choose the Save Current Settings as New Preset option from the
Preset drop-down menu.
8. Give your new preset a descriptive name and click Create.
9. Click Done to close the editor.
You should now see this information display in your gallery.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Output Settings panel
The Output Settings panel contains
the settings that affect the large
image component of the gallery.
Note: Your options are going to vary
with each gallery type. Figure 12-15
shows the Output Settings panel for
the Lightroom HTML Gallery. The
types of controls that can appear in
this panel are
 Quality: This control sets the
amount of JPG compression
applied to the large image. The
more compression, the smaller
the file size, but the appearance
can be degraded with too much
compression. I wouldn’t go
below 50.
 Size: This control determines
the width of the large image in
pixels. Only available in the
Airtight galleries. A large image
is easy to see, but also easy to
steal (and use). For most uses
I can’t see going larger than
800 pixels.
 Metadata: Gives you the option to leave all metadata intact in the large
JPGs (by selecting All from the drop-down menu), or stripping every-
thing but your copyright (by choosing Copyright Only). Only available in
the Lightroom Flash and HTML galleries.
 Add Copyright Watermark: Pulls the copyright data you entered into
the Copyright field of the Metadata panel in the Library module and dis-
plays it as a watermark on the photo. Only available in the Lightroom
Flash and HTML galleries.
 Sharpening: This is a new addition to Lightroom 2, which applies one of
three levels of sharpening (low, standard, or high) when the gallery
leaves Lightroom. Standard is a good default amount. (Sharpening is
only available in the Lightroom Flash and HTML galleries.)
 Photo Borders: Controls the width of the border around the large image.
Only available in the SimpleViewer.
Figure 12-15: The Output Settings panel.

 Padding: Controls the amount of space between the large image and
thumbnails. Only available in the SimpleViewer.
 Allow Right-Click to Open Photos: When checked, a viewer of your
gallery can right-click the large photo and choose to have that image
open by itself in a new window. Enable this option if you want people to
be able to download a copy of the large image. Only available in the
SimpleViewer.
Step 4: Save your settings as a template for reuse 
You don’t want to have to re-create the wheel each time you upload a Web
gallery, so this is where templates come into play. In fact, I keep the
Lightroom Templates collapsed, and only use my templates these days.
Here’s an overview of how to manage and save yours:
1. (Optional) Create a new template folder.
Press Ctrl+Shift+N (Ô+Shift+N on a Mac), or go to Web➪New Template
Folder. Give the folder a descriptive name and click the Create button.
Keeping your templates orga-
nized can increase your effi-
ciency by providing order to
your template collection. The
Template Browser only displays
template folders and individual
templates in alphanumeric order
below the Lightroom Templates
folder. To keep my starter tem-
plate folder at the top of the list,
I name it with a number, as shown in Figure 12-16. Note: It isn’t possible to
create folders within folders.
2. Create a new template.
Press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac), or click the + symbol in the Template
Browser header, or go to Web➪New Template. Give it a descriptive
name, assign it to your desired folder, and then click the Create button.
Step 5: Save your photos and settings as a special module collection
I briefly went over collections earlier, but these special collections require a
little more explanation. Lightroom 2 brought with it a fundamental change in
how collections can be structured as well as some additional functionality.
Let me explain by focusing on what you can do now. Figure 12-17 shows the
Collections panel. The Collections panel is now a standard feature in all areas
of Lightroom except the Develop module, which puts all of your collections
within easy reach (almost) everywhere you are.
279
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery
Figure 12-16: Creating a new template folder.

280
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
The best way to keep a group of col-
lections together is to put them in a
collection set (as in a set of collec-
tions). I am now in the practice of
creating a new collection set when
I am in the midst of sorting photos
after import (which I cover in
Chapter 5), but you can create new
sets as you need them via the +
symbol in the Collections panel
header and choosing Create
Collection Set. 
Along with the addition of the
Collections panel to other modules
came a new module-specific type of
collection (there is one for Library,
Slideshow, Web, and Print). You can only create a module collection from
inside each respective module. Each collection type has its own icon (refer to
Figure 12-17 to see the Web icon highlighted). Here’s what makes them special:
 The module collection retains all the settings configured in that
module from the last time that collection was in use.
 You can create multiple module collections that each use different
settings.
 They can contain any grouping of photos you wish.
 Double-clicking the collection icon will automatically bring you to that
module with that collection of photos with all the settings associated
with it.
So, while these are optional I think you will find that they can be a great tool for
organizing and accessing your photos. Here are the steps for creating a module
collection that will become associated with the current module settings:
1. Click the + symbol in the Collections panel header and choose Create
Slideshow.
This will launch the Create Slideshow dialog box.
2. Enter a descriptive name in the Name field.
3. (Optional) Click the Set drop-down menu to add it to an existing col-
lection set.
I strongly recommend that you use Sets to keep your collections orga-
nized. If you don’t already have a set created you can create a set later
and drag drop individual collections into the set.
4. Click Create to add the collection to the Collections panel.
Figure 12-17: The Collections panel.

If you change your mind about any collections you’ve created you can delete
them (just the collection, not the photos inside them) by selecting the collec-
tion and clicking the - symbol in the Collection panel header.
Putting it all together
As promised, I’m going to close this section by walking you through a practi-
cal example. I recommend maximizing your workspace and reducing panel
clutter as much as possible while you work. To that end, press F to jump to
full screen mode, press F5 to hide the Module Picker, and then press F7 to
hide the left panel. Here are the steps to customize the AutoViewer gallery so
it looks like what you see in Figure 12-18:
Figure 12-18: Customized Web gallery.
1. Select the Airtight AutoViewer from the Gallery panel.
I love this gallery! It’s just a fun and simple way to create a slick gallery
that can double as a slideshow. For the sake of creating a template, I’m
going to skip the Site Info panel, as there’s nothing to configure there
until you’re actually creating a working gallery, in which case you enter
the name of your gallery and move on.
2. Expand the Color Palette panel.
3. Click the Background color swatch and set it to a light gray.
You’re certainly free to choose a different color, but keep in mind that a
neutral gray doesn’t compete or influence the colors in your photos.
281
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery

282
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
4. Click the Border color swatch and set it to black.
In case it wasn’t clear from Figure 12-18, I’m going for a “filmstrip look”
here.
5. Expand the Appearance panel.
6. Set Photo Borders to 10 pixels.
7. Set Padding to 0.
This brings all the images into a single contiguous strip. The width of the
border is what sets them apart.
8. Set the Slide Duration to 4 seconds.
I find that 4 seconds is often just the right amount of time for a slideshow.
This setting only comes into “play” if the user activates the slideshow by
clicking the Play button.
9. Expand the Image Info panel.
10. Choose Edit from the Caption drop-down menu.
This launches the Text Template Editor so you can create a custom text
template (refer to Figure 12-14).
11. In the Text Template Editor, delete any text tokens in the Editor
window.
Deleting all tokens means you start with a clean slate.
12. Select Copyright from the last drop-down menu in the IPTC Data sec-
tion of the Text Template Editor. (Refer again to Figure 12-14.)
Doing so puts the Copyright token in the Editor window, which pulls the
data entered into the copyright field of each photo into the gallery
image. Because this gallery type doesn’t include a copyright watermark
function, but does display caption data across the photo, you now have
a means to apply a copyright watermark to your photos!
13. Choose the Save Current Settings as New Preset option from the
Preset drop-down menu.
You now have a copyright text template.
14. Click Done to close the editor and use that text template.
The Text Template Editor closes, and you return to the Web module. You
see your copyright information displayed on the active photo. (If you
don’t, go back and enter your copyright via the Metadata panel in the
Library module.)
15. Expand the Output Settings panel.

16. Set Size to 600 pixels and leave Quality at 90.
When you put photos on the Web, you need to think about a file’s dimen-
sions in pixels and its size in kilobytes. You always want it just large
enough to get the job done, but no larger. 
17. Click the Preview in Browser button below the Collections panel.
Although it’s great to get a live preview inside Lightroom, a truism in
Web development is that what really counts is how an image displays in
a browser, so always check in your Web browser before you decide it’s
done. Click everything that is clickable and make sure everything works
as expected.
18. Press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac) to save these settings as a new template.
At this point, your gallery should match Figure 12-18. You now have a new
template in your template browser. Well done!
Web Gallery Output Options
Testing your Web gallery locally (meaning on your computer) is standard
operating procedure in Web development, but the next phase is testing on a
Web server. Lightroom has a built-in FTP (File Transfer Protocol) utility that
enables you to upload your gallery directly to your Web server without ever
leaving Lightroom! However, you also have the option to export all the Web
gallery files directly to your hard drive if you either don’t have FTP access to
your Web server, or prefer to use your own FTP application.
Uploading your gallery with Lightroom
To test your images on a Web server, you need access to a Web server. A Web
server is just a computer that “serves” files over the Internet. If you’re just
sharing your gallery with friends or family, you should check your Internet
Service Provider (ISP). ISPs commonly include Web server space as part of
your package. Just keep in mind that the link to this type of gallery will prob-
ably look something like this:
http://internetserviceprovider.net/~yourusername
Although people might look at you funny when you say, “tilde,” (which is
how you pronounce that symbol in front of yourusername), you’re already
paying for that Web server space, so don’t worry about the funny looks and
learn to live with the tilde in order to save yourself some money.
283
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery

284
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Clearly, the professional solution is to get your own Web site. It doesn’t cost
as much as you might think (sometimes as little as a few dollars per month).
Web-hosting companies are a dime a dozen, so ask your Web-savvy friends
who they recommend.
I’m going to assume, then, that you’ve somehow secured access to a server.
Nicely done. Now, you need to come up with three critical pieces of informa-
tion to configure Lightroom so that it can upload your files to your Web host:
 Server address: This is the FTP address needed to access the Web server.
 Username: The username for your FTP account
 Password: The password for your FTP account
The following Steps list walks you through the steps involved in setting up
Lightroom’s FTP configuration dialog: 
1. Choose the Web module from
the Module Picker and expand
the Upload Settings panel, as
shown in Figure 12-19.
2. Choose Edit from the FTP
Server drop-down menu.
The Configure FTP File Transfer
dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 12-20.
3. Enter your FTP server informa-
tion in the Server field, along
with the username and pass-
word you were given for that
server. 
Check the Store Password in
Preset check box if you’re the
only person using that computer.
4. Configure the Server Path
field.
What you enter here will vary
based on the Web server. Server
path refers to the folder on the
Web server where Lightroom
stores the files you upload. In some cases, you leave this field blank; in
others, it might be something like public_html/. Ask your Web host-
ing provider if you’re not sure what to enter. Unless you’re instructed
otherwise, leave the Protocol drop-down menu set to FTP, the Port menu
set to 21, and the Passive Mode for Data Transfers drop-down menu set
to Passive.
Figure 12-19: The Upload Settings panel.

Figure 12-20: The Configure FTP File Transfer dialog box.
5. Choose the Save Current Settings as New Preset option from the
Preset drop-down menu.
6. In the new dialog box that appears, give the Preset a name and then
click Create.
You return to the Configure FTP File Transfer dialog box.
7. Click OK in the Configure FTP File Transfer dialog box to close it.
In the Upload Settings panel, you now see the name of your preset listed
as the FTP Server. Now, all you need to do is decide where on your Web
server you want to store your gallery. 
8. In the Upload Settings panel, check the Put in Subfolder check box,
enter a name in the field below (refer to Figure 12-19), and then 
press Enter.
The “Full Path” that displays at the bottom of the panel shows where your
folder sits in relation to the Server Path field you configured in Step 4.
Note: Do not use spaces in your folder names because spaces in links can
be problematic.
This subfolder becomes part of the path or URL (Uniform Resource
Locator) to your gallery. Therefore, if you’re uploading a gallery of
flower photos (and who doesn’t have a gallery of flower photos?), you
might name the subfolder “flowers,” which would result in the following
path to your gallery:
http://www.yourdomain.com/flowers/
9. Click the Upload button in the bottom right of the panel.
After the progress meter has done its thing, navigate to your new gallery in
your Web browser and give it a test drive! If you make any changes to the
gallery in Lightroom be sure to reupload it.
285
Chapter 12: Building a Web Gallery

286
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Exporting your gallery
If you have preferred FTP software, or if you don’t have FTP access to your
hosting environment, you can click the Export button and save your Web
gallery to your hard drive and then upload the files outside of Lightroom.
Here are the steps:
1. Click the Export button.
It’s in the bottom left of the panel, next to the Upload button.
2. In the dialog box that appears, navigate to the location on your hard
drive where you want to save the gallery files.
3. Enter a name for the folder containing the gallery and click Save.
Wait for Lightroom’s progress meter to complete before attempting to upload
the gallery to your Web host. Be sure to upload the entire contents of the
folder. You can change the name of the folder holding all the files, but do not
change the name of any files within the folder unless you update the HTML
code within the files to reflect that change. At this point, Lightroom’s job is
finished and it’s up to you to complete the job. If you make any changes to
the Web gallery in Lightroom, you need to re-export the entire gallery.

Making Your Own Prints
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the print interface
 Establishing a print workflow
 Customizing print layouts
 Creating templates
 Working with your printer
T
he goal of Lightroom’s Print module is to facilitate getting your digital
work to paper in a color-managed environment with a high-quality
output. (Say that three times fast.) While originally geared toward sending
data to a local inkjet printer, Lightroom now also makes it possible to save
your print layouts as a JPG file that you can deliver to a print service.
Inkjet printing has come a long way. The technology behind
today’s printers, inks, and papers offer photographers an
incredible array of choice (combined with high quality)
for creating dazzling prints of all sizes. At the same
time, more online print services are appearing on the
scene, offering both high quality and a competitive
price. No matter which output path you choose, this
is really an exciting time to be printing!
Can I tell you what I think is one of the greatest
things about printing from Lightroom? It’s that you
can create a print right from your raw image data
without first having to save a TIFF, PSD, or JPG copy of
the original (most printing applications are unable to
print raw files). Gone are the days of having to create and
manage multiple versions of each file cropped, optimized, and
prepared for each print size! The disk space savings alone can
recoup the cost of purchasing Lightroom. Of course, you might need to
render TIFF, PSD, or JPG versions of your raw files at times, and that’s fine,
but it sure is great when you don’t have to bother!

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Exploring the Print module
I’d like to take a moment to reinforce that each Lightroom module is struc-
tured essentially the same way, which means the interface behaves the same
no matter where you are! You can show/hide and collapse/expand panels as
needed to maximize your work area, and only display the controls you need.
For a look at the Lightroom interface as a whole, flip back to Chapter 1.
Getting to know the panels and tools
As is typical for all Lightroom modules, the organizational and preview panels
are on the left side of the content area, while the right side holds the configura-
tion panels. The Filmstrip is across the bottom and the Module Picker is across
the top. Specific to each module are the tools provided for completing the task.
A unique aspect of the Print module is that it contains two different layout
possibilities (Contact Sheet/Grid and Picture Package), and although I will go
into each layout in great detail, I want to point out that your choice of layout
controls what configuration panels are available on the right side. To illus-
trate the difference, Figure 13-1 shows the Print module interface with the
Contact Sheet/Grid layout selected (which I’ll refer to only as Grid from here
on), and Figure 13-2 shows the Picture Package layout. It’s like having two
Print modules for the price of one!
Figure 13-1: The Print module interface showing the Grid layout.

Figure 13-2: The Print module interface showing the Picture Package layout.
An embarrassment of riches? Wait until you see the plethora of tools and
panels Lightroom lays at your feet. Admittedly, you never see all these panels
at the same time, but I thought it would be a good idea to list all of them for
easier reference:
 Menu bar: Contains both the applicationwide commands, as well as
module-specific menu options.
 Preview panel: Displays a preview of each template layout as you move
your cursor over the items listed in the Template Browser.
 Template Browser: Provides controls for creating new — and managing
existing — templates.
 Collections panel: Provides access to all the collections (think of them
as virtual folders) you’ve created, as well as the controls to add new
ones that retain all the print settings. Refer to Chapter 5 for a Collections
refresher if needed.
 Page Setup button: Launches the Printer Driver dialog box for choosing
your printer and paper size. The printer driver is the software that
installs with your printer for the purpose of configuring printer settings
and running printer maintenance. It’s a very important part of the print-
ing pipeline.
289
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

290
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 Print Settings button: Launches the Printer Driver dialog box for config-
uring your printer settings. The appearance of this dialog box varies
based on your operating system and printer model. It’s not a Lightroom
dialog box. You might need to pull out your printer manual if you’re not
familiar with configuring its settings.
 Filmstrip: Displays thumbnails of the active image grouping. It can be
used to reorder the photos if you’re working within a collection or single
folder.
 Layout Engine panel: Provides access to the two types of layout options:
• Contact Sheet/Grid: Create print layouts using a grid model where
each cell in the grid has the same dimensions. You can print differ-
ent photos on a single layout (meaning a different photo in each
cell, but the cells are all the same size).
• Picture Package: Create print layouts using cells of various dimen-
sions, but only one photo can appear on a single layout (meaning
the same photo in each cell, but the cells can be various sizes).
 Image Settings panel: Contains settings that affect the look of the
photos appearing in the layout.
 Rulers, Grid & Guides panel: Specific to Picture Package, this panel
provides options for the configuration of these particular layout aids.
 Cells panel: Specific to Picture Package, this panel controls the addition
and configuration of new cells to a print package layout.
 Layout panel: Specific to Grid, this panel provides options for creating
the desired grid layout to be used.
 Guides panel: Specific to Grid, this panel provides options for the con-
figuration of these particular layout aids.
 Overlays panel: Allows for an identity plate and supporting text to be
added to the print layout for output. Note: Textual photo information
can’t be added to a print package.
 Print Job panel: Controls output settings for sending data to a printer
or saved to JPG.
 Content area: Displays an updating and fully interactive preview of your
print layout.
 Toolbar: Provides controls for navigating between print jobs containing
multiple pages, an indicator for how many pages will be printed, and
the Use controls for designating which photos will be used in the print
layouts.
The choice of layout engine affects which panels display and the available
options within panels shared by both engines. I’ll continue to reinforce the
differences as we move through the workflow.

Becoming familiar with the menu options
The File, Edit, View, Window, and Help menus remain largely consistent through-
out Lightroom. You soon discover, though, that a couple of print options are
located in the File menu, as shown in Figure 13-3. The Print One Copy command
sends the current layout directly to the printer using the existing settings with-
out opening the printer driver — a great command to have when you’re set up
and just want to print. You also have a new submenu — Print Settings — that
opens the printer driver. Take note of the keyboard shortcuts!
The Print menu contains commands for creating new templates and template
folders, navigating between pages in a multiple page print job, and rotating
the photos. The Save Print Module Settings command allows you to save the
custom settings temporarily without having to create a template. You can
then select a template or change settings to compare layouts and then use
the Revert Print Module Settings command to return to your saved state.
Figure 13-3: The File menu in the Print module.
Setting Up a Print Job
Waiting to see a print for the first time can be a little bit like opening a birth-
day present. A mixture of hope and anticipation that it will be just what you
want while bracing for disappointment if it isn’t. Unless you’re buying your
birthday presents, you can’t do much about that, but you can ensure the best-
possible print emerges from your printer. To see what I mean, check out the
next sections where I provide you the process of setting up Lightroom to get
consistently good results.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Employing a print workflow
Although the layout engines — Grid and Picture Package — have some dis-
tinct differences and options, they still fit within the same place in the larger
print workflow. I do my best to address their individual quirks and foibles,
but for now, I just want to give you the big picture:
1. Bring your photos to the Print module.
2. Configure the page setup.
3. Select a layout engine for your starting point.
4. Customize the layout as desired.
5. Configure the output settings.
6. (Optional) Save your settings for reuse.
7. (Optional) Save your settings and photos as a special print collection.
I cover this in detail later in the chapter, but this new feature in Lightroom
allows you to bundle photos and settings in a special module-specific col-
lection. This is great if you want to save multiple print layout versions for
a given group of photos with the bonus of having quick access from the
Collections panel.
8. Print the layout.
In the next few sections, you get to take a closer look at each of the steps in
the process. I follow up by walking through the creation of both a Grid layout
and a Picture Package.
Step 1: Bring your photos to the Print module
The Library module is the most likely place you’ll begin to gather your
photos before moving to the Print module because it provides the greatest
access to your portfolio and contains tools for finding, organizing, and group-
ing. Whether you select a folder, a collection, or create a grouping based on
keywords or metadata, you need to identify and select the photos you want
to print before you can print them.
One of the best ways to begin the process is to use a collection because it
can contain photos from every corner of your imported portfolio. The other
benefits of using a collection are
 You can manually control the order the images appear in the print
layout.
 You can create an infinite number of collections and sort them inde-
pendently of each other.

You can only do a manual sort when you’re working within either a single
folder or a single collection. So, if you want to sort manually images that are
across a range of folders (or collections), you first need to put them into a
single collection and then sort. Lightroom refers to this sort order as User
Order. After you’re in either a single folder or a collection, then be sure to
grab the image, not the border, and drag and drop in the order you desire,
as shown in Figure 13-4. You can do this from the Grid view of the Library
module, the Filmstrip in any module, or in the Grid view of the Secondary
Display when enabled.
Figure 13-4: Manually sorting images within a collection from the Filmstrip.
After you’ve collected your photos for printing, it’s time to bring them into
the Print module. Press Ctrl+Alt+4 (Ô+Option+4 on a Mac) to jump over to
Print (or click Print in the Module Picker). Notice the image grouping you cre-
ated in the Library module is still displayed in the Filmstrip. If you’re using
the Secondary Display window — Window➪Secondary Display — you can set
it to Grid and access your photos from there as well.
If needed, you can further refine your image grouping with the Refine and
Custom Filtering options provided in the Filmstrip. For example, you could
filter your grouping to only images with a rating of three stars or greater by
clicking the third star above the thumbnails. The other filtering options (flags,
color labels, copy status, file type, metadata, and so on) work the same way.
Step 2: Configure your page setup
Before you dive into creating your layout, you need to tell Lightroom a few
things about the page you want to create. Click the Page Setup button below
the Collections panel, or press Shift+Ctrl+P (Shift+Ô+P on a Mac) to launch the
Print Setup (Page Setup on a Mac) dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-5.
The three things you want to do here are
1. Select your printer.
2. Select your paper size.
3. Select your paper orientation.
293
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

294
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 13-5: The Print Setup dialog box.
Click OK to close the dialog box. Lightroom uses this information to deter-
mine how the page displays in the content area as well as the document size
and the minimum margins. Choose View➪Show Info Overlay (if it is not
already showing) to enable the display of a nonprinting indicator that shows
you key information about your setup. You can also press the I key to toggle
this overlay on and off. Keep Info Overlay on while you get familiar with
Lightroom to serve as a reminder of what you’ve configured.
Step 3: Select a layout engine for your starting point
Expand the Layout Engine panel (refer to Figures 13-1 and 13-2) and choose
either Grid or Picture Package. Many of the panel options stem from this
choice. Before I get into the details, I want to clarify the differences between
these two layout engines so that you know which will best suit any given job.
If you’ve used Lightroom 1.0 for printing, then you’ve already used the Grid
layout engine. You already know that the Grid divides the paper into equally
sized cells and that it’s not possible to span a single photo across multiple
cells. You also know that the more cells you add, the smaller each cell
becomes (because the paper size remains constant). The Grid is for when
you want to print several different photos on a single page, although it’s pos-
sible to fill every cell on a page with a single photo. To print a single photo
requires just a single cell; to print a contact sheet you add more cells.
Picture Package is new to Lightroom 2. The essential distinction is that when
you create a Picture Package, you’re creating a layout for printing a single
photo in a range of sizes on one or more pages. Think school portraits, where
a single pose can be purchased in a package that includes prints from 8 x 10
down to wallet size, and in various quantities. This is a great feature for anyone

needing to produce a set package of prints quickly. Just keep in mind that
you can’t create a single-page Picture Package that includes more than one
photo. You can apply the same Picture Package layout to multiple photos, but
each photo requires its own page.
Step 4: Customize the layout as desired
This is the fun part! The rest of the right-hand panels are arranged with an
efficient workflow in mind, so keep working your way down. As I’ve said,
you’re going to see some differences in the options available depending upon
the layout engine you choose.
With Grid you have
 Layout panel
 Guides panel
With Picture Package you have
 Rulers, Grid & Guides panel
 Cells panel
The rest of the panels appear in both engines, aside from a few minor differ-
ences in the Image Settings and the Overlays panels. The next few sections
allow you to get up close and personal with each configuration panel.
Image Settings
The controls in the Image Settings panel, shown in Figure 13-6, affect what
happens inside each photo cell, regardless of the layout engine used. Here’s
what the various controls do:
 Zoom to Fill: When this option is
unchecked, your entire photo fits
within each cell. If the aspect
ratio of the cell is different from
the aspect ratio of the photo, the
photo won’t fill the entire cell.
When Zoom to Fill is checked,
the photo is sized to fill the
entire cell. If the aspect ratio of
the cell is different from the
aspect ratio of the photo, the
photo appears cropped. Note:
If your photo does appear
cropped, you can reposition it
within the cell by clicking and
dragging while in Grid layout or
by holding the Ctrl key (Ô on a
295
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints
Figure 13-6: The Image Settings panel.

296
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Mac) and clicking and dragging
while in Picture Package.
 Rotate to Fit: Check this box to
have Lightroom automatically
rotate each photo to best fit the
orientation of the cell. This is
handy when printing a sheet of
both portrait- and landscape-
oriented photos and you want
each photo to fill as much of the
cell as possible.
 Repeat One Photo per Page:
This pretty much does what it
says — fills every cell on a
single sheet with the same
photo. This option doesn’t
appear in Picture Package
because you can only include
one photo in a given package
anyway.
 Stroke Border: Adds a stroke
around each photo. Click the
color swatch to choose your
color. Keep in mind that the
stroke remains inside the 
cell, so increasing the stroke
decreases the size of the actual
photo. In Picture Package, this
option is called Inner Stroke.
 Photo Border: Controls the
width of the border around
each photo in a Picture Package
layout. The color of this border can’t be changed and is always white.
The option doesn’t exist in the Grid engine.
 Inner Stroke: Adds a stroke around each photo in Picture Package. Click
the color swatch to choose your color. Keep in mind that the stroke
remains inside the cell, so increasing the stroke decreases the size of the
actual photo. In Grid, this option is named Stroke Border.
Layout
The Layout panel, shown in Figure 13-7, appears only when the Grid engine is
active because all the controls affect the layout of the grid on the page. The
Layout panel has four sets of controls:
 Margins: The Margins sliders function independently of each other and
control the edge of the printable area on the page. The smallest margin
Figure 13-7: The Layout panel.

amount is determined by your printer driver settings, so if you want to
print borderless, be sure to enable borderless printing in your printer
driver (via the Page Setup button) before trying to zero out the margins.
(Borderless isn’t an option for every paper size and printer.) Set all mar-
gins to the same value to create centered prints.
 Page Grid: Controls the number of cells in the layout. Rows are horizon-
tal and columns are vertical.
 Cell Spacing: Adjusts the amount of spacing between cells. This option
is grayed out when the grid consists of a single cell.
 Cell Size: This determines the size of the actual printed photo.
Maximum cell dimensions are determined by the size of the paper and
the number of cells being used. Keep in mind that all cells in the grid are
the same size. If you’re interested in creating square cells, check the
Keep Square check box and the Height and Width sliders will be set to
the same value and linked to each other when moved.
Guides
The Guides panel, as shown in Figure 13-8, is also unique to the Grid engine. It
contains a set of layout guide tools (under Show Guides) that can be enabled
by checking their respective boxes. When the guides are enabled, you see
them display in the content area. Placing your cursor over any one of the
guides and clicking and dragging allows another means to make layout adjust-
ments. You can modify margins, cell size, and spacing this way. Checking the
Dimensions check box displays the cell size dimensions as an overlay in each
of the cells.
Figure 13-8: The Guides panel.
297
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

298
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Rulers, Grid & Guides
The Rulers, Grid & Guides panel, shown in Figure 13-9, is specific to Picture
Package. It provides the following layout aids for creating your package
layout:
 Ruler: The check box toggles the ruler on or off, and the drop-down
menu allows you to choose the unit of measurement.
 Grid: The check box toggles the Grid overlay on or off, and the Snap
drop-down menu allows you to choose to have each photo cell “snap” to
either other cells or the layout grid when moving cells around, and to
turn snapping off. I find that snapping to cells helps prevent cells from
overlapping each other when aligning them tightly.
 Bleed: This check box toggles the shaded area showing the unprintable
margin on or off.
 Dimensions: This check box toggles the display of the cell dimensions
within each cell on or off.
Figure 13-9: The Rulers, Grid & Guides panel.

The problem with cells overlapping is that one photo will print on top of the
other and cost you money in wasted paper and ink. Lightroom does try to
warn you if two or more cells overlap by displaying an exclamation point
inside a yellow triangle in the upper-right corner of the layout, as shown in
Figure 13-10. Click the Auto Layout button in the Cells panel (see next sec-
tion) to have Lightroom rearrange the cells correctly.
Figure 13-10: Cell overlap warning.
Cells
The Cells panel, shown in Figure 13-11, is also specific to Picture Package. As
the name of the panel indicates, all the controls contained here are for the
creation and modification of Picture Package cells. In the Add to Package sec-
tion, you find the following:
 Cell buttons: You use the cell buttons to add new cells to your layout —
just click the button representing the size you want to add. The six but-
tons represent the default cell sizes, but you can click the drop-down
arrow next to any button and choose a different cell size — or click Edit
to enter a custom cell size. Every button click adds a new cell. Additional
pages are added to the package as needed to accommodate new cells.
 New Page button: As you might expect, clicking this button adds a new
page to the package. You can create multiple new, blank pages before
299
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

300
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
adding cells, and then drag and
drop cells between pages to
create your layouts.
As soon as you have more than
one page in a package,
Lightroom displays a red Delete
Page button in the upper-left
corner of each page, as shown
in Figure 13-12. Click that button
to delete that page (and any
cells it contains) from the 
package.
 Auto Layout button: Click this
button to have Lightroom
attempt to arrange the cells to
make the most efficient use of
paper by rearranging cells in
the layout across all available
pages.
 Clear Layout button: Removes
all the cells from the layout.
Good for starting over.
After you’ve added a cell to the
layout, you can click and drag a
resize handle to change the dimen-
sions of the cell, or you can make
height and width adjustments using
the Adjust Selected Cell sliders. You
can reposition a cell in the layout by
clicking and dragging the cell to a
new location, or even move cells between pages if you so desire. To delete a
cell, just select it and press Backspace (Delete on a Mac). To duplicate a cell,
hold the Alt key (Option key on a Mac) while clicking and dragging a cell.
Keep in mind that each cell is simply a frame in which to place a photo. Your
photo has a particular aspect ratio, but you could potentially create multiple
cells with a range of aspect ratios. For example, a typical aspect ratio of an
uncropped photo is 2:3 (also known as 1:1.5). A 4-x-6 print has an aspect ratio
of 2:3. Therefore, if you place a photo with a 2:3 aspect ratio in a 4-x-6 cell, it
should fill the entire cell without being cropped. Now, if you also want to
include a 5-x-7 print in that package, you need to do some cropping because
the 5 x 7 would have a 1:1.4 aspect ratio. However, you don’t want to crop the
source photo itself because then it wouldn’t fit the 4-x-6 cell!
Figure 13-11: The Cells panel.

Figure 13-12: Delete page button.
Here’s where that Zoom to Fill check box comes in handy. After you check
that box, you see the photo in the 5-x-7 cell appear to get larger and fill the
available space in that cell; the 4 x 6 remains the same because it was already
filling the cell. Now you can print a full 4 x 6 and a full 5 x 7 from the same
source photo, and yes, the 5-x-7 print will be cropped, but the source photo
will remain unchanged. Additionally, you can move your photo within that 
5-x-7 cell to improve the default placement. Hold the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac)
and click and drag the photo within the cell for better placement. (You have
to hold the modifier key because otherwise you are moving the cell itself.)
Overlays
The Overlays panel contains the controls for the Identity plate in both layout
engines, as well as a few additional layout engine-specific overlay elements.
Figure 13-13 shows how the panel looks in each layout engine.
Look at the identity plate section first because it functions the same way in
both Grid and Picture Package. The purpose of the identity plate is to provide
a means to add either a textual or a graphical element to your printed page.
This could be your graphical logo or simply a textual copyright notice and
your name. You could apply it as a watermark on each image or place it on a
blank area of the page. 
301
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

302
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 13-13: The Overlays panel showing Grid (left) and Picture Package (right).
The identity plate appears in many places throughout Lightroom. (I provide
more in-depth coverage of it in Chapter 5.) Here are the basic steps for using
identity plate in the Print module:
1. Click the Identity Plate check box to toggle it on.
2. Choose Edit from the Identity Plate drop-down menu.
Choosing Edit launches the Identity Plate Editor.
If you previously created a custom identity plate, you’ll see it listed in
the menu and you can (obviously) choose it. I’m going to assume for the
sake of argument, though, that one hasn’t been created.
3. In the Identity Plate Editor, select either a styled text or graphical
identity plate.
4. Customize as desired.
Chapter 5 has bunches more on customizing your identity plate.
5. Choose Save As from the Custom drop-down menu if you want to save
your customized identity plate for future use.
Doing so launches the Save Identity Plate As dialog box, where you can
name this identity plate and click Save.
6. Click OK.

The identity plate appears in the content area. Click and drag the identity
plate to reposition it. You can adjust opacity and size as desired with the pro-
vided sliders. The Override Color option allows you to change the color of a
textual identity plate temporarily without permanently altering your saved
identity plate. You can rotate the identity plate by clicking the rotation
amount indicator (starts at 0 degrees) in the top-right corner of the panel.
Choose the amount and direction of rotation you require.
Check the Render on Every Image check box if you want to use the identity
plate as a watermark for all images in the layout. Just keep in mind that when
this option is enabled, the identity plate will be “rendered” to the center of
each photo. You can still adjust its rotation, scale, and opacity, but it cannot
be repositioned off the center.
Render behind Image is a little-used option that places the identity plate behind
your photos. This can be used when you want your identity plate and photos to
overlap, but don’t want the identity plate to print on top of the photos.
From here, the remaining options are unique to each layout engine. In the
Grid engine you have
 Page Options: Allows for the addition of page numbers, page informa-
tion, and crop marks to be printed on the page with your photos. Page
information includes
• Sharpening setting: The amount of sharpening you choose in the
Print Job panel.
• Profile used: The color-management setting you choose in the Print
Job panel.
• Name of printer: The name of the printer you use.
 Photo Info: Provides the ability to include a limited amount of textual
information about the photos being printed. Click the check box to
enable, and then click the drop-down menu to choose a text template to
apply or click Edit to create a new text template. You can adjust the size
of the font via the Font Size drop-down menu. The font face and position-
ing cannot be changed.
In Picture Package, Cut Guides provide a printed visual to aid in cutting the
photos after printing. Choose either Lines or Crop Marks.
Step 5: Configure the output settings
After you finalize your layout, as outlined in the previous sections, it’s time to
prepare the data for output. This is the phase where you prepare Lightroom
to hand off the image data to the printer (or a JPG file to a print service). The
prep work here involves configuring a few settings in the Print Job panel
and/or tweaking settings in the printer driver — if you’re printing locally. (To
access your printer driver, click the Print Settings button at the bottom of the
303
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

304
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
right panel.) The most critical component of this hand-off process is the
color management of the image data. The next few sections take a closer look
at each setting involved.
Print Job
The Print Job panel, as shown in Figure 13-14, is where you configure your
Lightroom output image data so that it meets the specifications for the job at
hand. The options are the same for both Grid and Picture Package layout
engines:
 Print To: The Print To drop-down menu is where you choose whether
you want to send your output to a printer or save it as a JPG file.
 Draft Mode Printing: When checked, Lightroom uses the image data
from its preview cache instead of rerendering image data from your
source files. The benefit of this is purely speed. The tradeoff is quality.
The quality of the image data in the preview cache (controlled by the
File Handling tab of the Catalog Settings dialog box) is usually good
enough for thumbnails on contact sheets, which is when I am most likely
to use Draft Mode printing. Believe me; if you’re printing contact sheets
for hundreds of images, you’ll appreciate the speed boost! When in Draft
Mode print resolution, Print Sharpening and Color Management configu-
ration options are disabled. The Color Management setting is set to
Managed by Printer.
 Print Resolution: When checked, you can set the resolution value for
Lightroom to use when it renders the image data you want delivered at
output. Here’s why I tend to leave it unchecked: If enough pixels exist in
my source photo so that the native resolution is between 180–480 ppi,
then I don’t worry about it. Here’s an easy way to see the native resolu-
tion at a given print size:
1. Select your photo.
2. Choose the Grid layout engine from the Layout Engine panel.
3. Create a cell that matches your desired print size.
The “Layout” section, earlier in the chapter, has everything you
need to know about creating cells for the Grid engine.
4. Check the Dimensions box in the Guides panel.
5. Uncheck Print Resolution in the Print Job panel.
6. Look at the Print Size overlay in the cell.
This little trick works in both layout engines, but I just picked Grid
for this example. The key is to have Dimensions checked and Print
Resolution unchecked. Lightroom displays the print size in the
selected units as well as the native resolution for that size of print
(refer to Figure 13-12).

If you’re in the 180–480 ppi
window, then you’re good to go.
However, if that makes you the
least bit uneasy, then go with
the default setting of 240.
If you’re printing to a JPG and
you’re not sure what your print
service requires, your safest
setting is going to be 300 ppi.
 Print Sharpening: This function
received a substantial upgrade
in Lightroom 2 and I’m pleased
to say that the upgrade pro-
duces some excellent results.
Adobe worked with the group of
folks who wrote the book on
print sharpening to create the
sharpening algorithms that are
applied to your image data.
Now, you won’t see any change
in the content area because this
sharpening is applied only after
you click the Print button, when
Lightroom renders the image
data from the source file and
applies all your Lightroom
adjustments. The proof is going
to be in the print, so I highly
suggest you perform a set of
test prints on each type of
media you use with each sharp-
ening setting to get a sense of which you prefer. Here’s how you do that: 
1. Check the Print Sharpening box.
2. Choose the desired amount (Low, Standard, or High) from the
Print Sharpening drop-down menu.
3. Choose either Matte or Glossy (depending on the paper type
you’re using) from the Media Type drop down menu.
You can also apply sharpening when saving your output in JPG format —
you determine your settings the same way as when you’re printing 
to your attached printer. Don’t be surprised by how the image looks if
you open it in Photoshop; the proof is still going to be in the print.
 Color Management: Possibly the most important setting in this module,
simply because a bad Color Management setting can single-handedly
ruin your output (and possibly your day). The goal of color management
is to literally manage the conversion of colors between Lightroom’s
305
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints
Figure 13-14: The Print Job panel.

306
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
working color space and the color space of the output device. The
method for achieving the best output is to let Lightroom manage the
conversion. The alternative is to let the printer manage the colors.
When the print job is configured to let the printer manage colors — by
selecting Managed by Printer from the Profile drop-down menu —
Lightroom sends the image data using its ProPhoto RGB color space and
leaves it up to the printer driver to convert those colors to the output
color space correctly. The problem is that not all printers know how to
handle ProPhoto RGB data and, therefore, are unable to convert the colors
correctly. Feel free to test the Managed by Printer option, but I don’t really
recommend it. That said, if you want to try it, here are the steps:
1. Choose Managed by Printer from the Profile drop-down menu.
2. Configure the other Print Job settings as desired.
Things like unchecking Draft Mode Printing, setting your resolution
(or not), and applying sharpening.
3. Click the Print Settings button and do the necessary Print
Settings stuff in the Print Settings dialog box.
Stuff like going into Advanced Settings and turning on the printer
driver’s color adjustment setting, setting paper type and print
quality, and then clicking OK to return to Lightroom.
If the colors look good, then your printer can handle the data Lightroom
is sending. If you see a color cast, or the colors look washed out, then
your printer can’t handle the data Lightroom is sending and you need to
have Lightroom manage the color.
You may be wondering why Managed by Printer is the default setting for
Draft Mode printing. The reason is that, with Draft Mode printing, the
image data is sent from the preview cache in Adobe RGB space, which
most printers can handle.
To let Lightroom manage the colors, you need to have installed the ICC
profiles for the paper and printer combination you’re using. (ICC stands
for International Color Consortium, a group of major players in the 
digital-imaging industry that define the format for color profiles with the
goal of improving color management across systems.) The manufacturer
of the paper (which can also be the same company that makes the printer)
typically provides these profiles. Go to the paper manufacturer’s Web 
site and download the latest profile available for the specific paper and
printer model you’re using. After installing the profile with the directions
provided by the supplier, do the following to set up Lightroom correctly:
1. Choose Other from the Profile drop-down menu.
The Choose Profiles dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-15.

Figure 13-15: The Choose Profiles dialog box.
2. Check the box next to the profile for the paper you’re going to
use and then click OK.
You’re brought back to the Print module.
3. Click the Print Settings button at the bottom of the left panel, go
into the properties or advanced settings of the printer driver,
and turn off color adjustment.
This is absolutely critical or else the printer driver will attempt to
manage the colors, which typically results in light prints with a
magenta cast. Access to these settings varies with each operating
system and printer. Depending on your printer driver, look for a
color management setting that reads “off,” “no color adjustment,”
or “no ICM.” Consult your printer manual if you’re not sure where
this setting is on your system. Figure 13-16 shows the location of
this setting for an Epson 3800 on Windows.
4. In the print driver, select paper type and quality settings and
then click OK.
You’re brought back to the Print module.

Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
Figure 13-16: Color adjustment setting on an Epson 3800 on Windows.
After you return to Lightroom, you still need to choose a rendering
intent. “What’s that?” you ask. Well, when Lightroom is set to convert
colors to the output space by using the ICC profile you choose, it needs
you to tell it how to handle colors that are beyond what the printer is
capable of printing. In other words, it needs you to tell it what your
“rendering intent” is. It gives you two choices:
• Relative: This option keeps all the colors that are within the gamut
of the output color space and chops off those outside it.
• Perceptual: This option remaps all colors in the source space to fit
within the destination space. The downside is that colors that are
within the gamut can appear desaturated, but the upside is better
gradation between colors and overall better color detail when
many out-of-gamut colors are present.
I don’t blame you if you’re thinking that neither of these choices sound
that great, but keep in mind that the goal of both Rendering Intent
options is to preserve the original color appearance. Therefore, you
probably wouldn’t notice a difference with either choice for many
photos. The safest general-purpose choice is Perceptual, but I would
encourage you to make a few test prints with both to get a feel for any
differences.

If you’re a Mac user running Leopard and you’re printing to a printer that
supports 16-bit data, you can now print in 16-bit from Lightroom. The benefit
is improved gradations, but it might take a keen eye to spot the difference
between an 8-bit and 16-bit print. If you fit the above criteria, you can enable
this feature by first checking the 16-bit Output box in the Print Job panel, and
then enabling 16-bit printing in the printer driver.
After you have a layout and your print settings are configured, it might be in
your best interest to save them for reuse. Read on to find out how to do that.
Step 6: Save your settings for reuse
This optional step in the workflow has the potential of combining all the
steps to this point into a single click. You just invested all that time creating
the layout and configuring all your output settings, so if there’s any chance
that you’d repeat those steps with the same or different photos, then I highly
suggest you save your work. Here’s how:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+N (Ô+Shift+N on a Mac) to create a new template folder.
Alternatively, you can go to Print➪New Template Folder. Then all you have
to do is give the folder a descriptive name and click the Create button.
Keeping your templates orga-
nized can increase your efficiency
by providing order to your tem-
plate collection. The Template
Browser displays template fold-
ers and individual templates in
alphanumeric order, right below
the Lightroom Templates head-
ing. To keep my starter template
folder at the top of the list, I name
it with a number, as shown in
Figure 13-17. Note: You can’t create template folders within folders.
2. Press Ctrl+N (Ô+N on a Mac) to create a new template from the set-
tings you’ve specified.
Alternatively, you can go to Print➪New Template. Give the template a
descriptive name, assign it to your desired folder, and click the Create
button.
Step 7: Save your photos and settings as a special module collection
I briefly cover collections earlier, but these special collections require a little
more explanation. Lightroom brought with it a fundamental change in how
collections can be structured as well as some additional functionality. Let me
explain by focusing on what you can do now. Figure 13-18 shows the
Collections panel. The Collections panel is now a standard feature in all areas
of Lightroom except the Develop module, which puts all of your collections
within easy reach (almost) everywhere you are.
309
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints
Figure 13-17: Creating a new template folder.

310
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
The best way to keep a group of collections together is to put them in a col-
lection set (as in a set of collections). I’m now in the practice of creating a
new collection set when I am in the midst of sorting photos after import
(which I cover in Chapter 5), but you can create new sets as you need them
by clicking the + symbol in the Collections panel header and then choosing
Create Collection Set.
Along with the addition of the Collections panel to other modules came a new
module-specific collection (there’s one for Library, Slideshow, Web, and
Print). You can only create a module collection from inside each respective
module. Each collection type has its own icon (refer to Figure 13-18 to see the
print icon highlighted). Here’s what makes them special:
 Module collections retain all
the settings configured in that
module from the last time that
collection was in use.
 You can create multiple
module collections that each
use different settings.
 Module collections can contain
any grouping of photos you
wish.
 Double-clicking the collection
icon will automatically bring
you to that module with that
collection of photos and all the
settings associated with it.
So, although these are optional, I
think you’ll find that they can be a
great tool for organizing and accessing your photos. Here are the steps for
creating a module collection that will become associated with the current
module settings:
1. Click the + symbol in the Collections panel header and choose Create
Print.
The Create Print dialog box launches.
2. Enter a descriptive name in the Name field.
3. (Optional) Click the Set drop-down menu to add it to an existing col-
lection set.
I strongly recommend that you use Sets to keep your collections orga-
nized. If you don’t already have a set created, you can create a set later
and then drag and drop individual collections into the set.
4. Click Create to add the collection to the Collections panel.
Figure 13-18: The Collections panel.

If you change your mind about any collections you’ve created, you can delete
them (just the collection, not the photos inside them) by selecting the collec-
tion and clicking the - symbol in the Collection panel header.
Step 8: Printing the layout
It took a bit of work to get here, but this is the moment you’ve been waiting
for . . . clicking the Print button. Doing so launches the printer driver and
gives you one last chance for a preflight check of your settings. Until you feel
confident in your setup and configuration of Lightroom (as well as the setup
and configuration of the printer driver), I strongly recommend that you
double-check the printer driver settings after clicking the Print button. It just
takes a few seconds, and it can save you both time and money. When you feel
like you have it down and you consistently get the expected results from the
printer, click the Print One button to bypass the Print Driver dialog box and
simply send the data directly to the printer.
Putting it all together
I’d like to walk through a couple of examples to demonstrate how you’d set
up both a Grid layout and a Picture Package layout. I’ll save the Grid layout as
a JPEG file and send the Picture Package to my inkjet printer, just to highlight
the key differences in output as well.
Scenario One: Create a layout for four different photos, as shown in
Figure 13-19, that are saved as a JPEG and uploaded to a print service where
the layout is printed on 8-x-24 luster paper:
1. Select your photos in Library module and then switch to Print
module.
2. Click the Page Setup button, located at the bottom right of the content
area.
Doing so launches the Print Setup (Page Setup on a Mac) dialog box.
3. Select the printer, paper size, and paper orientation, and then click OK.
Even though this layout is being saved to JPG, you still need to set the
layout parameters. In this case, I choose an Epson 3800 printer, create 
a custom 8-x-24 paper size, and choose landscape orientation. Note:
The Info Overlay in Figure 13-19 reflects this configuration. The paper
size is the key factor in this step.
4. Click Contact Sheet/Grid in the Layout Engine panel.
5. Expand the Image Settings panel, check the Zoom to Fill check box,
and leave the other options unchecked.
I typically crop my photos in Develop to match the desired output
aspect ratio because it provides greater control over the cropped com-
position, but I want to demonstrate that it isn’t required.
311
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

312
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
6. Expand the Layout panel, and set the number of rows to 1 and the
number of columns to 4.
This creates four cells.
7. Check the Keep Square check box, and set the Cell Size height to
5 inches.
The width snaps to 5 inches because the Keep Square check box is
checked, which creates four 5-x-5 cells.
8. Set all margins to 0.80 inches.
This amount varies with each layout, but in this case, the 0.80 setting
creates an equal amount of horizontal spacing between each photo from
edge to edge. Because my top and bottom margins are equal, the photos
are also centered vertically.
9. Click and drag each photo within each cell for best composition.
These four photos were not previously cropped to a 1:1 aspect ratio, but
by choosing Zoom to Fill, they appear correctly cropped in the print
layout. However, this autocropping might not be the best composition,
so a little tweaking to center each subject is required.
10. Leave everything in the Overlays panel unchecked.
11. Expand the Print Job panel and make sure the Print To drop-down
menu is set to JPEG File.
12. Uncheck Draft Mode Printing.
13. Leave File Resolution set to 300 ppi.
300 ppi is what most print services will expect, so leave it there unless
instructed to do otherwise by the print service.
14. Choose Standard from the Print Sharpening drop-down menu and
Glossy from the Media Type drop-down menu.
I’m using luster paper, which is a soft gloss.
15. Set the JPEG Quality slider.
The default is 100, but if you’re concerned about file size (because
you’re uploading this file), you can dial it back to 90 without any visible
loss of quality.
16. Leave the Custom File Dimensions check box unchecked.
Lightroom has already calculated the pixel dimensions of the JPEG file
based on the page dimensions and the file-resolution setting.
17. Choose the correct profile from the Profile drop-down menu.
What is correct is determined by the print service you use. Asking them
will give you the best answer, so always ask. Lightroom will embed the
profile in the resulting JPG. I know the print service I use prefers sRGB,
so that’s what I choose.

18. Choose a rendering intent.
Perceptual is usually the safest choice.
19. Click the Print to File button.
20. In the new dialog box that appears, choose a Save location on your
hard drive, name the file, and then click Save.
The JPEG file is saved to that location and is ready for you to deliver to
your print service. 
Figure 13-19: Grid layout example.
Scenario Two: Create a Picture Package made up of 3 5-x-7 prints and 
24 31⁄2-x-21⁄2 prints to be printed with an attached inkjet printer on 11-x-17-inch
Epson’s Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster.
1. Select a photo in Library module and switch to Print module.
I’m only going to demonstrate a single photo in landscape orientation.
Additional photos can use the same package, but they’ll be printed on
additional pages.
2. Click the Page Setup button, located at the bottom right of the
content area.
Doing so launches the Print Setup (Page Setup on a Mac) dialog box.
3. Select the printer, paper size, and paper orientation, and then click OK.
In this case, I choose an Epson 3800, 11-x-17 paper in portrait orienta-
tion. Note: The Info Overlay in Figure 13-20 reflects this configuration.
4. Expand the Layout Engine panel and select Picture Package.
313
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

314
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
5. Expand the Image Settings panel, check the Zoom to Fill check box,
and leave the other options unchecked.
I typically crop my photos in Develop to match the desired output
aspect ratio because it provides greater control over the cropped com-
position, but I want to demonstrate that it isn’t required.
6. Expand the Rulers, Grid & Guides panel, check all boxes, and choose
Cells from the Snap drop-down menu.
I find the guides helpful, but feel free to leave them off if you don’t.
7. Expand the Cells panel, click the Clear Layout button, and then click
the 5 x 7 button in the Add to Package section three times.
Lightroom positions each new cell tightly against the previous cell.
8. Click the 2.5 x 3.5 button 24 times.
With each click, a new cell appears in the layout. After the first page is
full, a second page is created automatically. The result is a two-page
layout, as shown in Figure 13-20.
9. Leave everything in the Overlays panel unchecked.
10. Expand the Print Job panel and make sure the Print To drop-down
menu is set to Printer.
11. Uncheck Draft Mode Printing.
12. Uncheck Print Resolution.
13. Choose Standard from the Print Sharpening drop-down menu and
Glossy from the Media Type drop-down menu.
I’m using luster paper, which is a soft gloss.
14. Choose Other from the Profile drop-down menu.
15. In the Choose Profiles dialog box that appears, check the box next to
the profile for the paper printer being used, and then click OK.
In this case, I select Pro38 PLPP, which is the profile for the premium
luster paper on the 3800. Profile names are notoriously cryptic, so I sug-
gest writing the name of the profile on the paper’s box as a reminder.
The paper manufacturer should indicate which is which when you
download the profiles, but if not, a Google search will likely yield the
correct name. The selected profile shows in the Print Job panel.
16. Choose a rendering intent.
17. Click the Print Settings button and choose your paper type, quality
setting, and most importantly, turn off Color Management, and then
click OK.
18. Choose Print➪New Template from the main menu.

19. Enter a descriptive name in the New Template dialog box that appears
and then click Create.
Doing so stores all the settings that you just made in that template.
20. Click the Print button, confirm all printer driver settings in the Print
dialog box that appears, and then click Print.
In the beginning, I urge you to confirm your printer driver settings before
committing the print to paper. Paper and ink is just too expensive to waste.
21. Eagerly await the print at the output tray!

Working With Your Printer
Although Lightroom is an integral component in the process of producing a
printed photo, it can’t do it alone. Whether you’re printing to a local printer
or saving your print job as a JPG you want to send to a print service, the role
of the actual printing device (and its software) is crucial to your success.
If you’re printing locally, take some time to do the following:
 Locate your printer’s manual and find out how to care for your
printer. They need love too.
 Perform a nozzle check and clean and align the print heads if needed.
 Check the printer manufacturer’s Web site to see whether there’s a
newer version of your model’s printer driver.
315
Chapter 13: Making Your Own Prints

316
Part IV: Sharing Your Work with the World 
 Keep at least one spare set of ink cartridges on hand.
 Go to the paper manufacturer’s Web site and download the latest ICC
profiles for the paper type you’re using.
If you’re planning to send your JPG layout to a print service, take some time
to do the following:
 Go to the print service’s Web site and read its file submission require-
ments. Take special note of pixel dimensions, resolution, and ICC pro-
file suggestions.
If you can’t find the information, call Customer Service and ask it to send
you that info.
 Look through its frequently asked question (FAQ) section. You might
find an answer to a question you didn’t know you had.
 If it provides a custom ICC profile for its paper/printer, then down-
load and install it.
 Send a test file prior to relying on it for an important job.
The great thing about a print service is that it’s staffed with people who make
prints for a living, and they want you to have a good experience! If you have
any questions about them or the process of preparing a file for delivery,
shoot them an e-mail or give them a call before you send that first test file.
The time you spend maintaining your printer, preparing for its use, and
checking in with your print service can save you countless hours of frustra-
tion and headache by preventing problems before they occur.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
truly believe Lightroom is the future of digital
photo processing and management, and I want
you to get the most from it. Lightroom is still a
young application, and I expect it to grow and
mature with time. The contents of the ﬁrst four
parts of this book enable you to use Lightroom
from import to output, but I’m grateful for this last
opportunity to help you take your Lightroom
experience to the next level. 
In Chapter 14, I introduce you to a whole world of
Lightroom resources that might prove to be just
as important as anything I tell you about how
Lightroom works. There’s an international commu-
nity of Lightroom users out there just waiting for
you to join them!
I close things out in Chapter 15 by training you to
become your own help desk, helping you avoid a
few gray hairs in the process.

C
learly, you are someone who wants to increase
your understanding of how Lightroom works,
and how to get the most from it. Lightroom is a
dynamic and evolving product. Over the life cycle of
the first version of Lightroom, six free updates were
released. These updates not only kept Lightroom up-
to-date with the latest cameras on the market, but
each release included some bug fixes, some enhance-
ments, and even some new features. Some updates
were must-haves and some were not, but in every case,
it’s in your best interest to stay informed of Lightroom’s
evolution.
In addition to keeping Lightroom up-to-date, a growing community of
Lightroom users and third-party developers offer product support, tem-
plates, tutorials, and plugins that can significantly improve your Lightroom
experience. When I pulled together this top ten list, I realized these are
resources I rely on and use multiple times every day, and the great thing
about them is that they’re all open 24/7 and most of them are free.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Making the Most of Adobe’s Online
Support Center
www.adobe.com/support/photoshoplightroom
Make the Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Support Center your first stop if you
run into a Lightroom problem that you need help solving. (Don’t forget to see
if I cover it in Chapter 15 first.) If you like to get information straight from the
horse’s mouth, then this resource fits the bill. In addition to Adobe’s fee-
based support service (a last resort), the Support Center has a stunning
array of free resources available. Everything from technical support to video
and text-based tutorials can be found here.
Adobe has separated the content into four options: 
 The first option is a search of its vast Knowledgebase, which includes
the Lightroom Help file as well as tutorials and “TechNotes” (short arti-
cles providing solutions to common problems).
 TechNotes for the most common questions are found listed under
Option 2.
 If the Knowledgebase doesn’t provide the answer you’re looking for,
then head to Option 3 (my favorite) and click the Discuss It in the
Forums link. Adobe hosts User-to-User forums for each of its products.
These are Web sites where users can post questions to other users and
get answers free. The Lightroom User to User forum is populated by a
wealth of experienced users who go out of their way to answer ques-
tions and help troubleshoot problems. Here’s a quick look at how you
can use it to find help:
1. If this is your first time visiting the forums, you need to create a
free user account first. 
2. Check whether an answer already exists by doing a search. A quick
forum search might reveal that your question has already been
answered! 
3. If not, start your own topic and be sure to provide key information,
such as your operating system, version of Lightroom, type of files
being used, and any other relevant information to help other mem-
bers help you.
4. If you’re still coming up empty, or you simply need to speak to an
Adobe representative, the links to Product Support and Customer
Service are also listed in Option 3. Be advised: Depending on the
nature of your issue and the contact you need to make, there might
be a fee involved (which is why I suggest this as a last resort).

Lightroom Community Help
http://learn.adobe.com/wiki/display/LR
In keeping with the community feeling that has grown up around Lightroom’s
development and evolution, Adobe is testing a community help system.
What Adobe did was take its standard Help file (the same one bundled with
Lightroom) and tie in relevant external resources to specific topics, and then
put a bunch of industry experts (referred to as Lightroom Learning Advisors)
in charge of adding new content.

Chapter 14: Ten Resources All Lightroom Users Need To Know
Blogging, RSS, and Podcasts
So many blogs these days are pouring out so
much content at all hours that it can be nearly
impossible to visit all your favorites in your Web
browser just to see if new content has been
released. The answer to this problem is RSS,
which is a TLA (three-letter acronym) for Really
Simple Syndication. How it works is that each
blog has an RSS feed, which is a means to send
blog content directly to an RSS reader (which is
an application that can display the code in an RSS
feed). So, instead of visiting your favorite blog
multiple times a day, you subscribe to its RSS feed
and new content will be delivered directly to your
RSS reader when it comes online!
To subscribe, you need a blog’s RSS feed and an
RSS reader. Many of the resources I provide in
this chapter are blogs so that should get you
started.
 RSS feed: To find a blog’s feed, look for a link
labeled something like “RSS Feed” or keep
an eye out for the (near) universal orange
and white RSS icon.
 RSS reader: After you locate the feed, you
need to get it into your RSS reader. RSS
readers come in many flavors (and most are
free). I use Mozilla Thunderbird as my e-mail
client of choice (on both Windows and
Mac) and it has a built-in RSS reader (go to
http://mozilla.com/thunderbird).
This way, I have all my e-mail and feeds in
one always-open application. Check your
current e-mail client or Web browser; odds
are you’ll find they have built-in RSS reading
capability as well. You might also check out
the Web-based Google Reader (go to
http://reader.google.com), or the
Mac only NetNewsWire (go to http://
newsgator.com), which are both good,
free options. After you enter the feed into the
RSS reader, you can just sit back and watch
the content roll in!
Bloggers not satisfied with delivering text-
based content to their audiences have moved
into providing audio and video as well; and 
so the podcast is born. A podcast (think broad-
cast for your iPod) is either an audio or a video
file that’s delivered via an RSS feed and then
played in a compatible player. Tutorials on using
software are well-suited to this video format,
and there’s no shortage of quality video tutori-
als for Lightroom. I find iTunes (free for both
Windows and Mac) to be well-suited for sub-
scribing to and playing video and audio pod-
casts. You can download iTunes from http://
apple.com/itunes.

One of the greatest aspects, in my view, is that it’s a living document. It con-
tinues to expand as new content comes online. It’s fully searchable, and
topics are cross-linked to other related topics. If you find the Help content
leaves you wanting more, then click the Learn More link on each page to see
if additional educational content has been added. You can even log in (after
creating a free user account) to add links to content, ask questions, and leave
your comments. Because of the cross-referenced nature of the content, your
search for one answer can lead you to many interrelated topics.
Lightroom Journal
http://blogs.adobe.com/lightroomjournal
Lightroom Journal is the official blog for the Lightroom team. What it lacks in
quantity is made up in quality. Essential information about Lightroom issues,
releases, and more can be found here. Visitors are able to leave comments and
more often than not receive a timely response from someone on the team.
You can also subscribe to this blog’s RSS feed to get new content delivered

George Jardine on Lightroom and Digital
Photography
www.mulita.com/blog
George Jardine is Adobe’s pro photography evangelist, and he really knows
Lightroom! He’s been involved with Lightroom’s development from the start
and is creating the single best archive of Lightroom’s history and develop-
ment on his blog. It takes the form of a series of audio and video podcasts
going back to 2006. When you have the spare time, go back to the beginning
and keep listening (and watching) until you’re caught up. You’ll gain an appre-
ciation for the thoughtfulness that has gone into Lightroom’s development. 
History is fine, but you find some real tutorial gold interspersed throughout
the interviews and discussions with photographers and engineers. I sincerely
believe the complete podcast archive should be included on the Lightroom
installation disk, but I guess this is as close as it will get.

Lightroom-News.com
http://lightroom-news.com
When you want all Lightroom news, all the time, Lightroom-News.com, is the
place to go. A staff of industry experts on an ongoing basis adds new content
covering Lightroom releases, plugins, tutorials, and other relevant news.
ThisWeb site is delivered in blog format, complete with a link to add to your
RSS reader. 
A cool aspect of the site’s design is that it takes a page from Lightroom’s abil-
ity to reduce and simplify the interface. You can click any of the arrows in the
headers of the left and right columns to show or hide the contents. Nice!
The National Association of Photoshop
Professionals
www.photoshopuser.com
I admit my bias for this one right off the bat, but even if I didn’t work for
them, it would be a mistake not to include the National Association of
Photoshop Professionals (NAPP) as a top-ten resource. Becoming an NAPP
member isn’t free, but it pays for itself many times each year. Although
Photoshop remains the focus of NAPP, the organization has fully embraced
Lightroom. I think an NAPP membership is a great value to Lightroom users
because it includes the following:
 Subscription to Photoshop User magazine: Eight issues per year

Lightroom Killer Tips
www.lightroomkillertips.com
Before opening your wallet, if you want to get a taste of the quality material
NAPP offers, head to Lightroom Killer Tips and see what Matt Kloskowski
(NAPP’s education and curriculum developer) is sharing.
I don’t know where he finds the time, but every week Matt adds new content
in the form of presets, tips, and video tutorials that are driven in large part by
the comments left by visitors to the site. Matt really knows his stuff and has
such an accessible personality; I think you’ll find this one of your favorite
places to get your Lightroom fix.
As a testament to how popular Matt’s presets have become, some 600+ (and
growing) Flickr users created a group dedicated to showcasing photos devel-
oped with his presets. If you’re a Flickr member, too, go to www.flickr.com/
groups/647354@N23 and show off what you have!
Lightroom Forums
www.lightroomforums.net
When you want to rub virtual elbows with fellow Lightroom users from
around the world, Lightroom Forums is the place you can hang your virtual
hat. This resource is a labor of love populated by new and experienced users
alike. In fact, I’ve never found an Internet forum more welcoming to new
users than this place. So don’t be shy!
Discussions range from problem-solving to Lightroom news to sharing tips and
techniques. You need to set up a user account, but it’s completely free (and
mildly addicting). One thing the portal asks of all members is to indicate your
operating system and Lightroom version when you ask for help (not to be
nosy; it’s critical information for diagnosing any problem). This is a frequent
stop in my Web surfing, so I’ll be sure to say hello when you introduce yourself.

Lightroom Galleries
www.lightroomgalleries.com
The Web galleries that come with Lightroom are great and quite versatile, but
there comes a point in every Lightroom user’s life when he or she starts
wanting more. The Lightroom Galleries site was the first resource to start
offering additional Lightroom Web galleries and one that still contains the
most comprehensive offering. Before downloading new galleries, you can
take the sample versions for a test drive, leave comments, and ask questions.
As a bonus, there’s a dedicated forum for discussing the galleries as well as
tutorials for diving under Lightroom’s hood and creating your own custom gal-
leries (although I don’t recommend that for the inexperienced Web developer).
Lightroomers!
http://lightroomers.com
I’d like to say I saved the best for last, but not only am I too modest it just isn’t
true. What I will say is that this is my blog dedicated to helping Lightroom
users. I regularly share news, tips, reviews, and tutorials. Subscribe to the RSS
feed, leave me a comment, or shoot me a question. I’m always happy to help
folks get the most out of their Lightroom experience.

veryone has off days, and computers do too. Even
worse is when those days coincide! A time may
come when you’re working along, and Lightroom
behaves in an unexpected manner. This isn’t cause
for panic (that comes much later); it just means you
have a problem to solve. Luckily, a number of
resources and people can help.
Between my work on the National Association of
Photoshop Professionals (NAPP) Help Desk and my
time spent on various Lightroom-centric forums, I’ve
found that if one person’s had a particular problem,
someone else has probably already gone through the
same thing — a completely unique problem is rare.
Sometimes problems are a result of user error, some are a
result of a conflict with other applications on your system, and
some are the result of limitations in the application.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Here are some of the most-frequently reported issues I’ve encountered (and
their solutions) to hopefully save you a few gray hairs and lost hours. I’ve
also included some guidelines on how to be your own Help Desk!
Lightroom Troubleshooting 101
The essential goal of troubleshooting is to find the exact location where a
known good input results in a bad output. At that point, you’ve isolated the
“bad” component and can then focus on fixing, replacing, or sometimes work-
ing around it. Tracking down the problem component among your comput-
ers, monitors, printers, and software is often easier said than done! Unless
plumes of smoke are pouring from the back of the computer, just knowing
where to start looking can be a challenge. The following steps can help you
diagnose where things went wrong and perhaps even solve the problem:
1. Take a step back and triple-check that the settings you’re using are
configured correctly for the task you’re trying to accomplish.
I often rely on what I think is happening instead of what is actually hap-
pening. Sometimes I just have other things on my mind and sometimes
I just can’t see what’s right there in front of me. Even if you’re sure
you’ve configured Lightroom correctly, take a moment to double-check
those settings one more time before moving to Step 2.
2. Close and reopen Lightroom.
Sometimes turning Lightroom off and then back on is just the ticket. If
Lightroom is still acting quirky, proceed to Step 3.
3. Reboot your computer.
The problems you see in Lightroom may be a symptom of a larger system
issue. Rebooting gives every application a chance for a do-over, and it
gives you a chance to get up and get more coffee. Start Lightroom back
up and attempt to repeat the behavior. If the problem persists, move to
Step 4.
4. Replace Lightroom’s preference file.
Lightroom stores all your applicationwide preferences in a single file. If
Lightroom or the computer shuts down unexpectedly (whether a system
crash, an electrical storm, or someone tripped over the power cord), the
preference file can become corrupted and cause all kinds of quirky prob-
lems (as most corrupted things tend to do).
If you replace the preference file, Lightroom re-creates a brand new one
and reverts to its default settings. I’ve seen this cure all kinds of strange

problems! The basic steps are the same (with some slight differences)
for both Windows and Mac OS X operating systems, so I separate the
steps for Windows and Mac.
On Windows:
a. Choose Edit➪Preferences, and then click through each tab and
note your settings.
This is so you can reconfigure them the same way later, if needed.
b. Click the Preset tab and then click the Show Lightroom Presets
Folder button.
This launches a Windows Explorer window showing the Lightroom
preset folder.
c. In Lightroom, on the Preferences dialog box, click OK to close
the dialog box and then close Lightroom.
d. In Windows Explorer, double-click the Lightroom folder to open
it and then double-click the Preferences folder to open it.
e. Rename the Lightroom Preferences.agprefs file to
Lightroom Preferencesagprefs.old.
The purpose of this is to hide the old preference file from Lightroom
and trick it into creating a brand new one. You could just delete the
old one, but renaming it allows you to go back to it later if the prefer-
ence file isn’t to blame.
f. Restart Lightroom.
If the problem goes away (great!), the old preference file was the cause.
You can go back into the Preferences folder, delete the “old” one, and
then reconfigure your new preference settings (Edit➪Preferences) the
way you had them before.
If the problem continues (not so great!), the preference file wasn’t the
cause, so you can delete the “new” preference file Lightroom created
and then change the name of the “old” preference file back to
Lightroom Preferences.agprefs. You can then move to Step 5.
On a Mac:
a. Choose Lightroom➪Preferences, click through each tab, take
note of your settings, click OK, and then close Lightroom.
b. In Finder, go to the [User]\Library\Preferences folder.
c. Drag the com.adobe.Lightroom.plist file to the trash and
then restart Lightroom.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
If the problem goes away (great!), the old preference file was the cause.
You can now reconfigure your new preference settings
(Edit➪Preferences) the way you had them before.
If the problem continues (not so great!), the preference file wasn’t the
cause, and you can move the com.adobe.Lightroom.plist file from
the Trash to restore your original settings. Lightroom gives you the fol-
lowing warning: A Newer Item Named com.adobe.Lightroom.plist
Already Exists in This Location. Do You Want to Replace It with the Older
One You Are Moving? Click Replace. You can then move to Step 5.
5. Choose File➪New Catalog, enter a filename, and click Save.
The problem may be in your catalog file, and you need to rule that out.
Import some test images and attempt to re-create the problem. If every-
thing works as it should, the problem was likely in your working catalog
file. This is where those catalog backups can pay off. See the next sec-
tion for more information about restoring from a backup. If the problem
persists in the new catalog as well, you know your original catalog isn’t
the problem. Choose File➪Open Recent and then choose your real cata-
log file and delete the test catalog.
If you’re still facing a problem after Step 5, seek help from one of the
great resources I cover in Chapter 14. People really are standing by!
In case you’re wondering why I don’t include uninstalling and reinstalling
Lightroom as a troubleshooting step, it’s because I’ve never seen that fix
a problem that popped up after you’ve been using Lightroom for a while.
I include the steps a little later in this chapter in case you ever need to
know how.
Restoring a Catalog from a Backup
Storing catalog backups is just like keeping a fire extinguisher in your
kitchen: You kind of forget about it and hope you never have to use it, but if
you need it, you’re sure glad you had it on hand! You pull a catalog backup off
the bench and send it into the game for two main reasons:
 You had a disk failure and lost the working catalog.
 The working catalog became corrupted and wasn’t functioning correctly
(or at all).
The backup catalog created by Lightroom is an exact copy of your working
catalog (at that moment in time) and has the same name and file extension of

the working catalog. Here are the steps to replace a bad catalog file with a
good backup copy:
1. Close Lightroom.
2. Navigate to and open the Lightroom folder.
The default location of the Lightroom folder is in the My Pictures folder
(Pictures folder on a Mac). If you’re not sure where your folder is,
choose Edit➪Catalog Settings (Lightroom➪Catalog Settings on a Mac),
click the General tab and select the Show button to have Lightroom
open the folder for you.
3. Remove the existing catalog (.lrcat) file from the Lightroom folder.
If you know this is a bad catalog, you can delete it, but if you’re unsure,
just put it on your desktop (or some other folder) for safekeeping until
you’re certain it can be deleted.
4. Place the most recent backup copy of the catalog in the Lightroom
folder.
When you ran the backup function, you chose where catalogs are saved.
The default location is within the Lightroom folder in a Backups subfolder.
5. Restart Lightroom.
Lightroom opens at the same point it was at when the backup was run. Any
work performed in the working catalog after that backup was created is lost
(which is why the frequency in which you create backups is so important). If
Lightroom is functioning normally, you can safely delete the old catalog file (if
you haven’t already).
How to Uninstall and Reinstall Lightroom
If you notice a problem with Lightroom the first time you start it, something
may have gone wrong during the installation process. Uninstalling and then
reinstalling may be all that’s required to correct the problem. The process is
different for each operating system, so I separated the steps for each.
On Windows:
1. Close all running applications.
2. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Add or Remove Programs.
3. Select Lightroom from the applications list and click Remove.
4. Close the Add or Remove Programs dialog box.
331
Chapter 15: Ten Common Lightroom Problems and Their Solutions

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
On a Mac:
1. Open the Applications folder and drag the Lightroom application to
the Trash.
2. (Optional) Open the OS X Library folder (not the Library folder under
the User account), open the Receipts folder, and send the Adobe
Photoshop Lightroom.pkg file to the Trash.
This optional Step 2 should be used only if you’re downgrading to an
earlier version of Lightroom or you’re having trouble installing a new
version. Otherwise, you can skip this step.
Uninstalling Lightroom doesn’t touch the catalog file, the preference file, your
presets, or your photos. Uninstalling Lightroom removes only the applica-
tion. When you reinstall, you find all those other files just as you left them. To
reinstall on either platform, just double-click the installation file and follow
the installation instructions.
The Black/Blank Slideshow Problem
This one seems to affect Windows users and is the cause of some frustration
because the solution isn’t readily apparent. The problem can present itself
the first time you try to run a slideshow, or it can present itself after you’ve
used the slideshow successfully for some time. What happens is that you trig-
ger a slideshow to play, and all you see is a black screen. You may see the
slides advance in the Filmstrip if you’re playing the slideshow in the content
area, but the content area is black and stays that way.
The solution in all the cases I’ve dealt with is to update your video card
driver. Go to the Web site of your video card manufacturer and download the
latest video card driver for your specific card. The file you download is most
likely just like an application you install — double-click it and follow the
prompts. Restart your system after the installation is complete. Then recali-
brate your monitor, launch Lightroom, and attempt another slideshow.
My Slideshow Stops after a Few Photos
and Jumps Back to the Beginning
Another common slideshow-related issue is a slideshow that doesn’t play to
the end. Instead, the slideshow goes some number of photos in, and then
automatically jumps to the beginning and starts over. Subsequent attempts
may get a little farther into the show, but then the slideshow still jumps back
to the beginning before getting to the end.

Before you get to the end of your rope
1. Press the G key and jump to Grid view.
2. Press Ctrl+A (Ô+A on a Mac) to select all the photos in that grouping.
3. Choose Library➪Previews➪Render Standard-Sized Previews.
4. Wait for the progress meter to complete.
5. Switch to the Slideshow module and play the slideshow.
The most likely cause for this behavior is that Lightroom hasn’t finished ren-
dering the standard-sized previews for that group of photos, so your slideshow
displays all the images it has previews for and then jumps back to the start.
After all the previews are rendered, the slideshow plays all the way through.
The Minimize, Maximize, and Close Buttons
Have Vanished
Sometimes as a new user, you enable features without realizing you have and
then you’re stymied trying to figure out how to get back to the way things
were before. I’m the first to admit it’s happened to me, and judging by the
number of times I see this issue raised, I know I’m in good company.
Lightroom has three screen modes:
 Standard Screen Mode
 Full Screen with Menu
 Full Screen
You can move through each screen mode by pressing F. Sometimes people
inadvertently hit the F key and then find themselves in Full Screen mode and
don’t know how to get out! You can either continue pressing F to cycle back
to Standard Screen Mode or press Ctrl+Alt+F (Ô+Option+F on a Mac) to jump
right to Standard Screen Mode.
Lightroom Shows Photos Are Missing, 
but I Know They’re There
The person who coined the phrase no good deed goes unpunished may have
done so after having just reorganized her photo library with her file browser
of choice (Windows Explorer, Adobe Bridge, or Finder on a Mac) only to open
333
Chapter 15: Ten Common Lightroom Problems and Their Solutions

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Lightroom and find that all the folders and the thumbnails are all sporting
question mark icons.
I don’t think a day goes by where someone somewhere doesn’t run smack into
his own good intentions in this manner. These stories all seem to start the
same way . . . “I finally decided to organize all my photos” or “I needed to move
all my photos to a new drive,” and they all end with a new problem to solve.
The nature of the problem is that if you move folders and photos outside
Lightroom, Lightroom doesn’t know where to find them. All Lightroom knows
is what’s in its database. If the path in its database doesn’t lead to a photo,
Lightroom just considers the photo missing until you reconnect it to the
photo’s new location. The reconnection process isn’t difficult but does
require that you know where the file or folder is located. Here are the steps to
reconnect a folder that’s been moved:
1. Right-click (Control+click on a Mac) the folder showing a question
mark.
2. Choose Find Missing Folder from the contextual menu.
3. Navigate to the actual location of that folder, select it, and click OK
(Choose on a Mac).
Lightroom then reconnects to that folder and all its contents (including
any subfolders).
If only a few files show question marks, which indicates they’re missing, you
can reconnect them with a similar process:
1. Click the question mark icon.
2. Click the Locate button in the Confirm dialog box.
3. Navigate to the actual location of that photo, select it, and click Select.
Another reason files and folders appear to be missing is that a network or
external drive is disconnected. In the case of disconnected media, the solu-
tion is to reconnect the drive, and after your computer recognizes the drive,
Lightroom finds it, too.
Previews Are Gray or Show a Color Cast
After import, Lightroom goes through the process of rendering preview files
of all your imported images. When everything is functioning correctly, you
may not notice anything is happening or you may notice that the embedded
camera-generated preview file is being replaced by the Lightroom-rendered
preview.

When things aren’t functioning correctly, you notice that either the previews
aren’t rendering at all (they just appear as gray or black rectangles) or all
the previews have a strange color cast (typically magenta). I’ve only seen
this problem occur on Windows, and both issues are caused by a bad moni-
tor profile.
If you’re using a hardware-calibration device, the first thing to do is recali-
brate your monitor. This results in a new profile being created and should
solve the problem. If you’re not using a hardware-calibration device, this
might be a sign that it’s time to invest in one. In the interim, you can try
removing the current default profile to see if that makes a difference. The
process is slightly different between Windows XP and Vista.
On Windows XP:
1. Close Lightroom.
2. Right-click an empty area of your desktop and choose Properties.
The Display Properties dialog box appears.
3. In the Display Properties dialog box, choose the Settings tab, and
click the Advanced button.
This opens the dialog box for controlling the advanced display properties.
4. Choose the Color Management tab, select the profile in the Color
Profiles Currently Associated with This Device field, and click the
Remove button.
This removes it only from being associated with the monitor and doesn’t
delete the file. Repeat this step if more than one profile is listed.
5. Click OK to close the advanced display properties dialog box and then
click OK again to close the Display Properties dialog box.
6. Relaunch Lightroom.
On Vista:
1. Close Lightroom.
2. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Color Management.
3. Select the default profile listed in the Color Profiles Currently
Associated with This Device field and click the Remove button.
4. Click OK and then relaunch Lightroom.
Remember that removing the current default profile is a temporary solution.
Ideally, calibrate and profile your monitor with a hardware device.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Previews Change After Import
This is an often-asked question that stems from a misunderstanding more
than a problem. When you shoot in raw mode, your camera saves that raw
data to your memory card without processing it. However, your camera
embeds a JPG preview in each raw file — the same JPG preview that you see
on the back of your LCD screen. However, Lightroom has to render its pre-
views for every raw file. The result is that while you watch the imported files
appear on-screen, you first see the JPG preview you saw on the back of the
camera, and then it’s replaced by Lightroom’s version of the default process-
ing of that raw file. It’s very likely that the two versions won’t match, and the
new Lightroom user’s first thought is, “Why is Lightroom destroying my raw
files!?”
When the camera renders its JPG preview, it relies on the in-camera settings
you applied for color mode, saturation, sharpness, and so on. Your camera
may even have some special picture styles or black-and-white mode. Lightroom
doesn’t have access to any of those in-camera settings. All Lightroom has is the
raw capture data and its default rendering instructions for each camera model
it supports, which is kind of a recipe for disappointment if you don’t know
what to expect.
To get around this situation, you can apply a develop preset during import,
and Lightroom uses that preset setting to inform its default rendering. Some
users shoot in Raw+JPG mode and then import both as individual files. With
both versions in Lightroom, they attempt to match the rendering of the JPG
and then save those settings as a new Develop preset to be applied at import
to raw files. Most of the time, just knowing what to expect can make all the
difference. You can find more about the Import process in Chapter 4.
Lightroom Seems Sluggish
Over time, you may notice that Lightroom isn’t as snappy as it used to be
(hey, who is?). A decrease in speed as your catalog grows larger and larger is
normal, but you can do a few things for your disk and for Lightroom’s catalog
to keep them both running as smoothly as possible.
Here are some things you can do for your hard disk:
 Maximize your free space. It’s an inescapable fact that hard drives fill
up fast. Keep an eye on the amount of free space left on your startup
drive and don’t let it drop below 20 percent free. Some applications
require free space to function correctly. You don’t want your applica-
tions fighting each other over space. Uninstall unused applications,
delete unused files, empty your recycle bin (Trash on a Mac), or move
important files off to a different internal or external drive.

 Perform basic disk maintenance. Hard drives get a lot of use and can
often benefit from a little tender loving care. On Windows, you can run the
Error-checking utility, and after that’s complete, run the Defragmentation
utility. On Mac, periodically repair permissions with the Disk utility. Mac
users typically don’t benefit from running a Defragmentation utility
because the operating system does a better job of managing the disk
during normal operation.
After you do your housekeeping on the startup disk, you can turn your atten-
tion to Lightroom:
 Render standard-sized previews. Lightroom runs on previews. When
needed, Lightroom renders previews in the background while you’re
working. You can take control of this process by setting Initial Previews
on the Import dialog to Standard, which tells Lightroom to start render-
ing standard-sized previews as soon as the import process is complete.
You can also force the rendering process from within the Library module
by selecting all photos and choosing Library➪Previews➪Render
Standard-Sized Previews menu.
 Render 1:1 previews. If you view images at 1:1 (meaning 100 percent or
actual size view) in the Library module, Lightroom needs to render a 1:1
preview. If you’re trying to skip quickly between photos at 1:1, notice the
time it takes Lightroom to render each 1:1 preview while you work. After
the preview is rendered, switching between photos is much faster. Just like
with standard-sized previews, you can set Initial Previews on the Import
dialog to 1:1, which instructs Lightroom to begin rendering when the import
is complete, or you can force the rendering of 1:1 previews by selecting all
photos and choosing Library➪Previews➪Render 1:1 Previews menu.
 Turn off Automatically Write Changes into XMP. This feature has been
greatly improved since Lightroom’s initial release, but this background
process could be causing the performance lag you’re experiencing.
Choose File➪Catalog Settings, and then click the Metadata tab. Deselect
the Auto Write setting and then click OK. Run Lightroom normally and
see whether you notice any change in performance. You can still manu-
ally write to XMP by selecting files and pressing Ctrl+S (Ô+S on a Mac).
Check out Chapter 2 for more about what this setting offers.
 Optimize the catalog. If your catalog has gotten large and could use a
little housekeeping, choose File➪Catalog Settings and click the General
tab. Click the Relaunch and Optimize button. Lightroom closes, and the
catalog file is reorganized internally to operate more efficiently. This also
removes any unused space from inside the catalog file, which can
reduce its file size. The result is a smaller and more-efficient catalog,
although gains are only likely to be noticed by very large catalogs.
I hope you see some gains after following these suggestions. If Lightroom is
otherwise functioning normally and your system is getting a little long in the
tooth, you may want to consider a hardware upgrade in your future.
