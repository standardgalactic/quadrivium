General differential equations of ship dynamics
1	 General differential equations of 
ship dynamics
Summary: The aim of this chapter is the derivation of the general body motion equations both in the 
inertial and body fixed referency system with and without principle axis. A special attention is paid to 
the forces and moments arising from acceleration through the water. They are expressed through the 
added mass using potential flow assumption.
1.1	
Ship motion equations in the inertial reference system
The ship is assumed to be a rigid body with a constant mass m. The differential equations of the ship 
motion in the most general form are derived from the momentum theorem: The rate of change of the 
momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the direction of 
that force. Mathematically this theorem applied both for linear momentum and angular momentum can 
be expressed as
d
dt
⃗P = ⃗F,
d
dt
⃗D = ⃗M

(1.1)
whereas 
d
dt  is the substantial time derivative,  ⃗P  and  ⃗D  are respectively linear and angular momentums 
of the ship,  ⃗F  and  ⃗M  are respectively total hydrodynamic force and total hydrodynamic torque acting 
on the ship. The equations (1.1) are written in the inertial system which is at the rest relatively to the 
earth (further referred as to the earth-fixed system). The forces acting on the ship comprise
• hydrostatic (buoyancy) forces,
• gravity forces,
• forces (thrust and transverse force) and moments supplied by the propulsion system,
• ship resistance including wave resistance and drag caused by viscosity,
• additional forces and moments caused by waves (wave-induced forces),
• control forces and moments exerted by rudders or other steering devices,
• transverse force, lift and corresponding moments caused by the viscosity,
• forces and moments caused by wind,
• forces and moments caused by currents,
• forces and moments arising from acceleration through the water (added mass).

General differential equations of ship dynamics
The linear and angular momentums can be expressed through the kinetic energy of the rigid body by 
differentiation on velocity components:

(1.3)
where ⃗V =⃗iVx +⃗jVy + ⃗kVz  and ⃗ω =⃗iωx +⃗jωy + ⃗kωz  are respectively linear and angular velocity 
of the origin. The kinetic energy of the body is obtained by the integration of the squared local velocity 
at each body point ⃗r =⃗ix +⃗jy + ⃗kz  multiplied with the elementary local mass dm:

General differential equations of ship dynamics
The system (1.8) is the general system describing the six degree of freedom (6DOF) motion of the ship 
in earth connected reference system.
1.2	
Ship motion equations in the ship-fixed reference system
The ship motion is sufficiently simplified when instead of the earth-fixed reference system the ship 
fixed reference system is used. The origin of the ship fixed reference system is moving with velocities 
⃗V =⃗iVx +⃗jVy + ⃗kVz  and ⃗ω =⃗iωx +⃗jωy + ⃗kωz . Advantage of the ship-fixed coordinates is that the 
inertia moments, products of inertia and static moments are constant in time, i.e. dIij/dt = 0, dSi/dt = 0.
To rewrite the equations (1.1) in the ship-fixed reference system it is necessary to establish the relation 
between the linear and angular momentums written in different reference systems. This relation is found 
under condition that vectors of the linear and angular momentums are kept constant in the ship-fixed 
reference system.
Following to Kleinau (2001) let us consider consequently the translation with velocity 
⃗V =⃗iVx +⃗jVy + ⃗kVz  and rotation with angular velocity ⃗ω =⃗iωx +⃗jωy + ⃗kωz. At the time instant 
t both systems are coincided. At the time t + ∆t  the body is located at the point ⃗V ∆t.Vectors  ⃗P and 
⃗D  are also shifted from the point O to the point O′  (see Figure 1.1).
Figure 1.1: Change of the linear and angular momentums due to displacement of the origin of the ship 
fixed reference system from the point to the point.
As seen in Figure 1.1 the linear momentum vector transferred by the ship is not changed in the 
earth fixed system due to translation  ⃗Pa(t + ∆t) = ⃗Pa(t) = ⃗P.  The angular momentum is 
changed due to change of the arm of the linear momentum  ⃗Da(t + ∆t) = ⃗Da(t) + (⃗V ∆t) × ⃗P
= ⃗D + (⃗V × ⃗P)∆t.  Therefore, the contribution to rate of change of the momentums due to translation 
is:

Figure 1.2: Change of the linear and angular momentums due to rotation at the angle ⃗ω∆t
In the second step, the momentums vectors are turned during the rotation of the ship fixed reference 
system with the angular velocity  ⃗ω =⃗iωx +⃗jωy + ⃗kωz.  The magnitudes of both vectors remain 
constant. Their change in the earth fixed system occurring in time ∆t  is
⃗Pa(t + ∆t) = ⃗Pa(t) + ∆⃗Pa = ⃗P + (⃗ω × ⃗P)∆t,
⃗Da(t + ∆t) = ⃗Da(t) + ∆⃗Da = ⃗D + (⃗ω × ⃗D)∆t.
Therefore, the contribution to the rate of change of the momentums due to rotation is:
d⃗Pa rot

= ⃗ω × ⃗P, d ⃗Da rot

= ⃗ω × ⃗D.

General differential equations of ship dynamics
Taking (1.9) and (1.10) into account the momentum theorem in ship fixed reference system is written 
in the form:
d
dt
⃗P + ⃗ω × ⃗P = ⃗F
d
dt
⃗D + ⃗V × ⃗P + ⃗ω × ⃗D = ⃗M  
(1.11)
Here it should be noted that the forces  ⃗F  and moments  ⃗M  have to be determined also in the moving 
reference system. The second term in the first equation and second and third terms in the second equation 
describe the change of the linear and angular momentums due to translation and rotation of the ship 
fixed reference system. The right sides are responsible for momentum changes due to external forces.
The equations (1.11) were derived by Kirchhoff in 1869.
The ship fixed reference system is the Cartesian right-handed coordinate system (xyz) with x and y 
lying in a horizontal plane and z vertical, positive upward. The x axis is the longitudinal coordinate, 
positive forward, y is the transverse coordinate, positive to the port side. The origin is in the plane of 
symmetry. The vertical location of the origin lies at the level of the undisturbed free surface when the 
ship is at the rest.
Figure 1.3: Sketch of the ship fixed coordinate system.
The ship mass distribution is symmetrical with respect to the plane xz. Therefore, the products of 
inertia Ixy and Iyz as well as the static moment Sy  are zero in the ship fixed system. This is the second 
advantage of the ship-fixed coordinates. Also, the third product Ixz is often assumed to be zero. With 
these simplifications the vector components are:
Px = mVx + ωySz, Py = mVy + ωzSx −ωxSz, Pz = mVz −ωySx,
Dx = ωxIxx −VySz −ωzIxz, Dy = ωyIyy + VxSz −VzSx,
Dz = ωzIzz + VySx −ωxIxz.

(1.12)
Substituting (1.12) into (1.11) results in the general system describing the six degree of freedom (6DOF) 
motion of the ship in the ship-fixed reference system:

This system is integrated numerically using modern numerical 6DOF solvers (CFX, STAR CCM+, 
OpenFoam). In this case the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by direct integration of normal and 
shear stresses over the ship surface without the subdivision according to physical nature of forces (1.2).

General differential equations of ship dynamics
The forces  ⃗F  and moments  ⃗M  have to be determined in the moving principle axes coordinate system.
1.4	
Forces and moments arising from acceleration through the water
The physical nature of the forces and moments arising from acceleration through the water is the 
inertia of the medium which the body is moving in. Traditionally these forces are determined using the 
irrotational inviscid fluid model. This model is described in details in Kornev (2009b), Chapters 1, 2 
and 3. For students who did not attend in the lecture course on Fluid Dynamics we give overview of 
basic principles of the theory of flows in the Appendix A.

Kinetic energy of the fluid surrounding the body
If the flow is incompressible, inviscid and irrotional  (∇× ⃗V = 0)  the kinetic energy of the fluid 
surrounding the moving body is

Since the shear stresses are zero in the inviscid fluid, only normal stresses are present in formulae (1.26)

General differential equations of ship dynamics
1.4.5	
Ship motion equations in the ship-fixed reference system along the x-axis
The system (1.42) takes the simplest form for the case of the straight ship motion along the x-axis 
(Vy = Vz = ωx = ωy = ωz = 0):
(m + m11)dVx
dt = Fx  
(1.43)
As seen the fluid inertia results in the increase of the real mass  m   by the additional virtual mass 
m11. The total mass is becoming larger due to inertia of the fluid. That is why the mass m11 is called 
as the additional or hydrodynamic mass. The effect of the fluid inertia makes the ship motion milder, i.e.
mdVx
dt = Fx −m11
dVx
dt  
(1.44)
If the ship speed is growing dVx
dt > 0 the fluid inertia effect decelerates the ship motion and, vice versa, 
if the ship speed becomes smaller dVx
dt < 0 the fluid inertia effect accelerates the ship motion.

2.2	
Aims of the ship manoeuvring theory
The ship manoeuvring theory is intended to investigate the ability of ship:
 Figure 2.1: Coordinate system used in ship manoeuvring
• to keep the prescribed course,
• to change the course following a prescribed trajectory and to avoid obstacles,
• to change the speed.
Important questions for the specification of ship manoeuvrability may include Bertram (2000):
• Does the ship keep a reasonably straight course (in autopilot or manual mode),
• under what conditions (current, wind) can the ship berth without tug assistance?
• Up to what ratio of wind speed to ship speed can the ship still be kept on all courses?
• Can the ship lay rudder in acceptable time from one side to the other?
The characteristics usually used to regulate the manoeuvrability are discussed in the next sections.

Main assumptions of the theory
The ship manoeuvring theory is based on the following assumptions:
• The ship motion is occurred only in the horizontal plane xy. Heave velocity, rolling and 
pitching are neglected (Vz = 0, ωx = ωy = 0).
• The Froude number is small and the free surface deformation is neglected. The mirror 
principle (see Appendix B) is used to model the free surface effect. Hydrodynamically the 
ship is considered as a doubled body without any flow boundaries except the ship.
The doubled body has two symmetry planes that is why the ship has only eight added mass: 
m11, m22, m33, m44, m55, m66, m26, m35. The static moment of the doubled body and the product of 
inertia are zero, i.e. Sz = 0 and Ixz = 0. The system (1.42) is reduced to:

dt + (m + m11)Vxωz + (m26 + Sx) dωz
dt = Fy,
(Izz + m66) dωz
dt + VxVy(m22 −m11) + (m26 + Sx)( dVy
dt + Vxωz) = Mz.  
(2.1)
2.4	
Equations in the ship-fixed coordinates with principle axes
The principle axes coordinate system was chosen in Section 1.3 from the condition that all off-diagonal 
elements of the products of inertia and the static moments of body are zero. It simplifies the equation 
system. However, many terms proportional to off-diagonal elements of the added mass matrix remain. 
For example, the system (2.1) contains terms with m26. The motion equations have the simplest form 
if the axes are principle axes of the coupled system”body + fluid”. The system with principle axes 
can easily be found for the doubled body moving in the horizontal plane from the following conditions:
• the x axis is along the longitudinal axis of the doubled body,
• the xy and xz are symmetry planes,
• the position of the origin is found from the formula
m26 + Sx = 0 
(2.2)
Remember that the origin in the equation (1.67) was chosen from the condition that only body static 
moment is zero Sx = 0.

Munk moment
The second term −VxVy(m22 −m11) on the r.h.s in the moment equation is referred as to the moment 
of Munk who investigated this moment for Zeppelins.
The Munk moment appears in the full form only in the inviscid fluid. In the inviscid potential fluid the 
flow around the ship hull is shown in Fig. 2.2. In the bow area on the lower side we have the deceleration 
of the flow and increase of the pressure. On the upper side the flow is accelerated and the pressure 
decreases. As a result a lift force appears in the bow region. An opposed flow process takes place in the 
stern area in the inviscid flow. Here the deceleration arises on the upper side whereas the flow acceleration 
appears on the lower one. The negative down force counterbalances the lift and the total force is zero 
according to the D’Alambert paradox. However, these two forces produce the moment which is exactly 
the Munk moment.
This moment is called also as the unstable moment. It can be explained at small drift angles β. The 
velocity components are expressed through the ship speed and the drift angle:
Vx = V cos β, Vy = −V sin β  
(2.10)
Since  m11  is much less than  m22, the Munk moment is  MMunk = V 2
2 (m22 −m11) sin 2β
≈m22
V 2
2 sin 2β . This moment is the moment which causes the instability. With the other words, if 
a small drift angle appears, this moment increases this angle. Indeed, the additional moments arising 
due to the presence of small drift angle β > 0 is positive, i.e. it causes further increase of the drift angle:
∆Mz = βdMMunk
dβ
≈m22βV 2
0 cos 2β > 0

Equations of ship manoeuvring with three degree of freedom
In the real viscous fluid the flow in the stern area is changed. This change is taken into account in the 
wing theory by Kutta condition. The down force doesn’t appear and the unstable moment is approximately 
only a half of the Munk moment (see Figure 2.2). Very often the yaw moment Mz  is determined in 
measurements in real viscous fluids and capture the Munk’s part of the moment automatically. That is 
why it is common to carry the Munk moment to the right hand side of the moment equation and to 
consider the combination Mz −VxVy(m22 −m11) as a total yaw moment, i.e.

Equations in terms of the drift angle and trajectory curvature
Classical form of the manoeuvrability equations are written in non-dimensional form in terms of the 
drift angle and trajectory curvature. This form is very convenient to study the ship yaw stability. The 
time derivative of speed components (2.10) are:
dVx
dt =dV
dt cos β −V sin β dβ
dt = ˙V cos β −V ˙β sin β,
dVy
dt =dV
dt sin β −V cos β dβ
dt = −˙V sin β −V ˙β cos β,

(2.12)
where point over the quantity means the time derivative of this quantity, i.e.  ˙V = dV
dt , ˙β = dβ
dt .
To derive the non-dimensional equation form one uses the typical force representations:
Fx = Cx
ρV 2
2 AL, Fy = Cy
ρV 2
2 AL, Mz = mz

Substituting (3.4) in (3.1) one calculates all added mass. Nowadays the numerical solution of the equation 
(3.2) presents no serious difficulties and can be performed by any code using panel methods.
For some simple bodies there are analytical solutions. For instance, for an elliptical cylinder the following 
analytic formulae are valid

where a and b are semi axis of the ellipse (a > b).
The analytic solution which is the most interesting for shipbuilding is the solution for rotational ellipsoid. 
Unfortunately, this solution is cumbersome and contains non elementary functions. The results of 
calculation using this solution are presented in Fig. 3.1 for added mass coefficients.

In the simplest approach, the largest axis 2a is the ship length, 2b is a middle value between the width

Another way of determination of added mass is the use of the slender body assumption. Let us consider 
the added mass m22 = −ρ

S
ϕ2 cos(n, y)dS. Using the slender body estimations (2.3) the formula for

The formula (3.6) is easier than the original one  m22 = −ρ

S
ϕ2 cos(n, y)dS   since the contour  
added mass is calculated from 2D theory. Similar formulae can be written for the added mass m66:

Determination of added mass
Similarly, added mass m33, m35 and m55 can be found. Unfortunately, the slender body theory is not 
capable of simplifying the formulae for mass like m1k, since the effect of the motion in x direction is 
assumed to be neglected. The mass m′
22 can be found using 2D panel method which is much easier 
than 3D version of this method.
3.3	
Added mass of the slender body at small Fn numbers
In what follows we use the concept of doubled body assuming the Froude number is small and water 
surface deformation effects can be neglected. An effective way to get m′
22 is the use of the Lewis theory 
which became a classical way to determine the added mass in naval architecture. Lewis used theory 
of conformal mapping2 which is applicable only for two dimensional flows. According to this theory 
(see also chapter 5.8.1 in Kornev (2009b)) the physical plane z = x + iy  is mapped into an auxiliary 
plane ς = ξ + iη . The skill is to find such a mapping function z(ς) and inversion mapping function 
ς(z) so that the flow around the contour is mapped into the flow around a cylinder. Lewis succeeded 
in mapping of a special class of doubled ship frames, called further as Lewis frames, into cylinders. The 
Lewis frames (see Fig. 3.2) have the form typical for ship frames in the middle ship area. In the bow and 
stern regions Lewis frames are deviated significantly from the typical frames. Lewis inversion mapping 
function is written in general form
ς = z + a
z + b

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our

Determination of added mass
where a and b are real coefficients. Changing a and b one gets a family of Lewis frames. Lewis performed 
a serial calculation for various frames and presented his results in a form of a resulting diagram shown 
in Fig. 3.3. He introduced the coefficient (referred as to the Lewis coefficient) which is the ratio of the 
added mass of the frame to that of the cylinder with radius T

The slender body theory of added mass is a strip theory. It means that the resulting mass is obtained by 
integration of frame mass along the ship length. Every frame flow is considered as a two dimensional 
one at corresponding cross sections (strips). The slender body theory works well in the middle ship area. 
In the bow and stern areas the flow is essentially three dimensional. The effect of three dimensional flow 
on added mass can also be taking into account within the slender body theory using Munk correction 
factors. The idea of Munk becomes obvious from the following formulae
m22 = R2(a, b)m22 slender, m66 = R3(a, b)m66 slender,
R2(a, b) = m22 ellipsoid/m22 slender ellipsoid,
R3(a, b) = m66 ellipsoid/m66 slender ellipsoid.

Here R2(a, b) and R3(a, b) are the Munk’s correction factors (see Fig. 3.4). Again, the largest axis 2a is 
the ship length, 2b is a middle value between the width B and the draught 2 T. The added mass m11 can 
not be determined since the perturbations in x direction are neglected within the slender body theory. 
To overcome this problem Munk proposed to find m11 in a similar way like m22 but with the different 
correction factor:
m11 = R1(a, b)m22 slender. 
(3.15)
The added mass m22 slender ellipsoid  and m66 slender ellipsoid  are obtained from (3.13) taking the fact into 
account, that the cross section of the rotational ellipsoid is the cylinder which Lewis coefficient is one.
m22 slender ellipsoid = 4
3πρab2,
m66 slender ellipsoid = 4
15πρab3 
(3.16)
As seen from (3.16) the hydrodynamic mass m22 slender  obtained using the slender body theory is exactly 
equal to the volume of the ellipsoid multiplied with the water density. If the ellipsoid is in the equilibrium 
state in the water the mass is equal to the volume multiplied with the density (Archimedes law).

Determination of added mass
Therefore, the hydrodynamic mass m22 obtained using the slender body theory is equal to the ship mass.
This result can be used for rough estimation of the mass m22. The added mass m11 is about five, eight 
per cent, whereas the mass m66 is about 1.4Izz  (Kleinau (2001)).

Steady manoeuvring forces
4	 Steady manoeuvring forces
Summary: The most important part of this chapter is the representation of forces in full and truncated 
forms which are used in ship theory. Experimental determination of steady manoeuvring forces using 
PMM, identification and circular motion tests is discussed. A detailed description of force approximation 
proposed by Krylov Research Shipbuilding Institute is given.
4.1	
Introduction
The forces acting on the ship can be subdivided into steady manoeuvring forces steady manoeuvring forces , 
propulsion forces, forces arising on control elements, wave induced and forces caused by wind and current. 
In this chapter we consider the steady force component. The steady manoeuvring forces arise on the body 
moving with steady linear and angular velocities due to viscosity influence. The physical reason of the 
inception of the steady manoeuvring forces is illustrated in Fig. 2.2. If the ship moves with a steady drift 
angle in an inviscid flow, the lift force arises in the bow region whereas the down force acts on the stern 
area (Fig. 2.2a). The resulting force is in accordance with the D’ Alambert paradoxon zero. In the viscous 
fluid the flow in the stern area is changed due to influence of the boundary layer developing along the ship 
surface beginning from the bow. As a result the down force disappears at the stern part and the resulting 
force is not zero. This component is referred to as the steady manoeuvring force caused by the drift angle. 
The forces and moments appear also if the ship moves with any steady linear and angular velocity. In the 
manoeuvrability theory the steady forces arising due to drift angle and yaw angular velocity are of importance.
4.2	
Representation of forces
Using the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations (RANSE) technique, the steady forces can be 
calculated by direct integration of normal and shear stresses over the wetted ship area. This way requires 
huge computer resources, is time consuming and the prediction accuracy is often not satisfactory. The 
experiment is still remaining a main source of the force data used for prediction of manoeuvrability.
The experimental methodology is based on the representation of forces in form of different 
approximations. For instance, one uses a multivariate Taylor series expansion about the equilibrium 
condition Vx = V, Vy = Vz = ωx = ωy = ωz = 0:
Fn(Vx, Vy, Vz, ωx, ωy, ωz) =

Steady manoeuvring forces
4.2.1	
Hypothesis of quasi steady motion
Application of the Taylor series implies the hypothesis of quasi steady motion . The latter means that 
the forces are fully determined by instantaneous values of kinematic parameters neglecting the unsteady 
effects. The motion history influence is neglected. Strictly speaking the ship hydrodynamics depends 
on the ship states in previous times, because the wave surface, boundary layer and wake depend on 
the ship trajectory. However, the unsteady effects can be neglected if the characteristic time scales of 
the hydrodynamic processes are much smaller than the characteristic times of the ship motion. With 
the other words the ship motion is much slower than the change of the hydrodynamics characteristics. 
In this case the hydrodynamics is fully determined by instantaneous ship kinematic characteristics. 
With the other words, it is assumed that the hydrodynamic coefficients Cx, Cy, Cz, Mx, My, Mz  are 
frequency independent. This assumption is not necessary if the motion is modeled using coupled 6DoF 
simulation (see chapter 10).
4.2.2	
Truncated forms
In the shipbuilding the maximum order of the derivatives in the representation (4.1) is three. General 
forms of (4.1) for different bodies are given in Lewandowski (2004). The representation (4.1) contains 
high-order derivatives which are hardly to determine. There are no reliable theoretical or empirical 
means to calculate many of the second – and third-order terms (Lewandowski (2004)). That is why 
the expansion (4.1) is used in a very truncated form, which can be derived by further analysis showing 
that only a part of the derivatives has an essential impact on the ship dynamics. Additionally, the 
expansions (4.1) are significantly simplified if the ship symmetry is taken into account. In this case
F x(0, Vy, 0, 0, 0, 0) = Fx(0, −Vy, 0, 0, 0, 0),
F y(0, Vy, 0, 0, 0, 0) = −Fy(0, −Vy, 0, 0, 0, 0),
M z(0, Vy, 0, 0, 0, 0) = −Mz(0, −Vy, 0, 0, 0, 0).

(4.2)
Some of derivatives in (4.1) are zero. For instance, due to symmetry of the drag with respect to the velocity 
component Vy and ωz , the derivatives of the drag on Vy and on ωz  at Vy = Vz = ωx = ωy = ωz = 0 are 
zero:
∂Fx
∂Vy

Vx,Vy=Vz=ωx=ωy=ωz=0
= 0,
∂Fx
∂ωz

Vx,Vy=Vz=ωx=ωy=ωz=0
= 0 
(4.3)
These facts are used to truncate the expansions (4.1).
4.2.3	
Cross flow drag principle
The Taylor series expansion was also revisited using the so-called “cross flow drag principle” taken from 
the wing theory. Let us consider the steady ship motion with velocity components  Vx  and  Vy. The 
dependence of the transverse force arising on the ship is shown in Fig. 4.1 depending on the drift angle.

Steady manoeuvring forces
Figure 4.1: Typical dependence of the transverse force on the drift angle, q is the nonlinear 
part of the force.
The dependence of the transverse force coefficient on the drift angle Cy(β) consists of two components:
Cy(β) = Cβ
y β + ∆Cy  
(4.4)
Here  Cβ
y β  is the linear component whereas  ∆Cy  is the nonlinear component. As discussed in the 
wing theory (see Kornev (2009b), chapter 5.3) the ratio between two components depends on the wing 
aspect ratio. The ship under the drift angle is a wing with an extremely low aspect ratio AR ≈2T/L  . 
For such a wing the nonlinear part ∆Cy  is essential already at small drift angles and overcome the 
linear component

(4.5)
where the linear moment component  βdMz/dβ  is calculated around the wing middle point.
Formal application of the Taylor series expansion for the case under consideration gives:
Cy(β) = dCy
dβ β + 1

dβ3 β3 + ... 
(4.6)
The nonlinear component seems to be proportional to  ∼β3. In order to calculate the nonlinear 
component ∆Cy, Betz considered the wing under the cross flow V sin β. The additional transverse force 
∆Cy  is interpreted as a drag caused by the cross flow. According to Betz the nonlinear component is 
proved to be proportional to the drift angle squared but not cubed as in (4.6):
∆Cy = Cββ

Steady manoeuvring forces
The result (4.7) was confirmed in measurements. The problem now is the positive sign of the 
nonlinear force both at positive β > 0 and negative β < 0 drift angles, although intuitively it is clear 
that ∆Cy(β) = −∆Cy(−β). To avoid this contradiction the term  β2 is rewritten in the form |β|β. 
Therefore,
Cy(β) = Cβ
y β + Cββ
y |β|β  
(4.8)
The representation with the second order terms  Cββ
y |β|β   is used by Norrbin (1971), SNAME   
(Lewandowski (2004)), Sobolev and Fedyaevsky (1963). On the contrary Abkowitz (Abkowitz (1964)) 
uses the terms of the third order to represent the nonlinear components of forces.
4.2.4	
Some typical representations used in the ship manoeuvering
With considerations of facts discussed above the force representation proposed by SNAME  (Lewandowski 
(2004)) for manoeuvrability theory reads

Usually, the series expansions (4.9)–(4.11) are applied for force and moment coefficients Cx, Cy  and mz.

y , δR  is the rudder deflection. The expansion

the drift angle  β = arctan Vy/Vx  and the non-dimensional angular velocity Ω= ωzL/V .

Steady manoeuvring forces
The most general form of force representation is the polynomial representation which takes nonlinearity 
into account. A sample of such a representation is the method proposed by the Krylov Shipbuilding 
Research Institute (see section 4.3.3 below).
4.3	
Experimental determination of steady manoeuvring forces
Despite of a rapid development of numerical methods the experiment is still remaining a main source 
of manoeuvring force data. Here we discuss three experimental techniques of force determination.
Figure 4.2: PMM tests of the catamaran model NPL at the Seoul National University
4.3.1	
The planar motion mechanism (PMM)
The PMM is used in manoeuvring studies conducted in open water (see Fig. 4.2) and in ice (see Fig. 4.3). 
This technique has been pioneered in the USA by Gertler (1959) and Goodman (1960). The PMM allows 
a model to move in exact, preprogramming patterns while forces, moments and motion around the model 
are recorded. The model is towed in a testing tank and oscillates harmonically around a steady reference 
motion. The amplitude of oscillations and the frequency are prescribed by the PMM. For instance the 
PMM installed at the Oceanic Consulting Corporation, St. Johns, Canada (see (n.d.a)) produces the sway 
oscillations with the amplitude of 4 meters, the sway velocity amplitude of 0.7 m/s and yaw rates up to 
60 degree per second in the towing tank with the length of 200 m and the width of 12 m.
The idea of PMM in the simplest version can be easily illustrated using the Taylor series expansion (4.9)–
(4.11). Usually the expansions are used to find the forces on the left-hand side of the formulae assuming 
that all derivatives on the right-hand side are known. In the PMM methodology the forces are 
measured. The right hand sides of the formulae  Fx(Vx, Vy, 0, 0, 0, ωz),  Fy(Vx, Vy, 0, 0, 0, ωz) and 
Mz(Vx, Vy, 0, 0, 0, ωz) are known. The kinematic parameters Vx, Vy, ωz  are prescribed by the PMM 
at every time instant. Performing tests one obtains, say, M measurement points. The following conditions 
are valid for each i-th measurement point:

where i = 1, M  the measurement point number. Having 16 measurement points, one can calculate 
16 unknown derivatives in the system of linear equations (4.14)–(4.16). To increase the reliability of 
prediction, the number of experimental points is much more than the number of unknown derivatives. 
The resulting system is over defined (the number of equations is larger than the number of unknowns). 
In this case the derivatives are found from the condition that the optimal set of derivatives provides the 
minimum of residuals of the equations (4.14)–(4.16).
The approach using derivatives implies the quasi steady motion. The influence of unsteady effects, 
influence of frequencies in harmonic motions is not considered. To overcome this disadvantage 
Bishop and Parkinson (see Bishop and Parkinson (1970))  proposed to represent forces through the 
Fourier expansions based on the oscillatory derivatives following to the experience from the airplane 
aerodynamics. The PMM equipped with the harmonics analysis device is capable of determining the 
oscillatory derivatives as well (see Bishop and Parkinson (1970)).
For instance, if only the yaw oscillation motion ω = ω0 sin σt, ˙ω = dω
dt = ω0σ cos σt  is studied, the 
representation of the transverse force looks like
Fy(t) = a1V ω + a2 ˙ω = a1V ω0 sin σt + a2ω0σ cos σt  
(4.17)
Three remarkable points should be noted, considering the last formulae
• there is an explicit dependence of forces on time,
• additional term proportional to  ˙ω  takes unsteady effects (delay of forces change with 
respect to kinematic parameters change) into account,
• coefficients a1, a2 depend not on the time rather than on frequencies σ.
If A and B the coefficients of the Fourier expansion for the force Fy(t) provided from measurements:
Fy(t) = A cos σt + B sin σt ⇒A = a2ω0σ, B = a1V ω0
From this we obtain unknown coefficients in (4.17):
a2 = A/ω0σ,
a1 = B/V ω0

Circular motion test. Rotating-arm basin
The rotating-arm basin is the traditional and well-tried facility to determine the manoeuvring forces. 
The rotating arm is installed in a round form basin with diameters varying from 15 meters to 75 meters. 
For instance the rotating arm basin of the Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute is 70 m with depth of 
6.7 meters. The sketch of the facility is presented in Fig. 4.4. The model installed on the rotating arm at 
arbitrary drift angle is free for heave and pitch motions. Changing the distance from the model to the 
basin center allows one to control the model angular velocity. The frequency of rotation is changed in 
order to vary the linear speed of the ship motion. The drag, the transverse force and the yaw moment are 
measured using dynamometers. The forces and moments obtained from measurements are approximated 
as functions of β and ωz. Numerical differentiation of these approximations is then used to determine 
the derivatives. Unsteady effects are fully neglected in the rotating-arm basin tests.
One of the difficulties in the rotating-arm tests is the determination of forces at ωz = 0 since ωz ̸= 0 due 
to restriction on the arm length. This problem is easily solved, if the rotating-arm tests are supplied by 
tests in towing tank at ωz = 0 and  β ̸= 0. Another way which doesn’t require additional towing test 
measurements is the utilization of symmetrical conditions for forces and the moment. Let us consider 
the Figure 4.5 showing the ship in two turning motions along a circle trajectory at ωz > 0, β < 0 and 
ωz < 0, β > 0.
The following conditions can be established just from the analysis of the Fig. 4.5:
Fx(−β, ωz) = Fx(β, −ωz),
Fy(−β, ωz) = −Fy(β, −ωz),
M z(−β, ωz) = −Mz(β, −ωz).

(4.18)
In the formulae (4.18) β and ωz  are assumed to be positive. The conditions (4.18) are applied to find 
the hydrodynamic characteristics at ωz < ωzmin using the measurements done at ωz > ωzmin, β < 0  , 
where ωzmin is the minimum angular velocity which can be attained in the facility. To obtain the force 
Fy  at (β, −ωz) the measurement is performed at (−β, ωz). The measured force Fy(β, −ωz) is then 
multiplied by (–1). The forces and moment in the range −ωzmin < ωz < ωzmin  can be found from the 
interpolation of forces between  −ωzmin  and ωzmin as illustrated in Fig. 4.6. This procedure requires 
measurements with positive angular velocity and both positive and negative drift angles.

Identification method
The method uses the data obtained from the tests with self-propelled models or with real ships. During 
these tests the kinematic parameters of the ship motion, linear and angular velocities as well as the 
accelerations are measured depending on time. The motion equation systems can be written in the form

Steady manoeuvring forces
where i is the number of measurement. The system (4.19) can be considered as a system of linear equations 
for determination of coefficients on the left hand side. The coefficients are assumed to be constant during 
the motion apart of the drag Fxi(Vxi, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) which can be found from any empirical method. Again, 
like in PMM tests we have more experimental points and the resulting system (4.19) is over defined 
(the number of equations is larger than the number of unknowns). In this case the derivatives are 
found from the condition that the optimal set of derivatives provides the minimum of residuals of the 
equations (4.19). For that different methods of the optimization theory are used.
4.3.4	
Approximations of steady manoeuvring forces
Various series of experimental measurements were performed and approximated by different shipbuilding 
research organizations. Empirical methods of determination of manoeuvring forces are listed in the 
table 4.1.
Approximation proposed by the Krylov Shipbuilding Research Institute. The approximation proposed 
by KRSI is advantageous because it takes full nonlinearity of forces into account and it is valid for all 
drift angles in the wide range from zero to π, i.e.  0 < β < π . The forces are subdivided in two 
components. The first component is caused by the drift angle, whereas the second one arises due to 
angular velocity ωz.
The first component is represented in the form:

Study of Manoeuvrability
To study the manoeuvrability of a ship standard manoeuvres are performed. Usually turning circle and 
zig-zag manoeuvres are used to judge the steering capabilities. Use the manoeuvring software MANIS 
(Manoeuvring in sea)2 to conduct the following computations.
Figure 4.12: Coordinates system for manoeuvring ships
Turning Circle Manoeuvre
Perform a turning circle manoeuvre for δR = 20◦. To see the influence of the ship′s velocity, set propeller 
revolution to 1, 2 and 4 rps respectively. Set initial longitudinal velocity first! Also vary the draught about 
±3 m. Study the influence on the static velocity reduction, static drift angle and static turning radius.
Spiral Manoeuvre
Do a spiral manoeuvre for the ship, plot the dimensionless yaw rate (Ω) over the rudder angle (δR ) for 
different turning circle manoeuvres using  −10◦< δR < 10◦. Show the influence of trim (±3m ) on 
the behavior of the ship. Plot the dimensionless yaw rate over the rudder angle and discuss the effect 
on the dynamic stability according to the curves.

Ship Extension
The shipowner asked to extend the ship to increase the loading capacity. Therefore a parallel midships 
section with length of 10% of the ships length will be added amidships. As a side condition, the static 
turning diameter must not exceed a rise of 10% compared to the old ship configuration at a rudder angle 
of δR = 20◦. Compute the parameters (L, B, T, CB, CM, ...) for the new ship if necessary and implement 
them in MANIS. If the new turning circle diameter exceeds a rise of 10%, apply changes in the ship 
configuration like rudder area or effective aspect ratio of the rudder to match the criteria.
Note: Before starting a case, check the correlation between propeller revolution and initial velocity. 
Therefore, carry out a turning circle with δR = 0◦, and make sure that the static velocity is sufficiently 
close (first decimal place) to the initial velocity. Vary one parameter at a time, only! No cross-coupling!

Calculation of steady manoeuvring  
forces using slender body theory
5	 Calculation of steady 
manoeuvring forces using 
slender body theory
Summary: The simplest theory of steady manoeuvring forces determination is presented in this chapter. 
The application of this theory is only possible in conjunction with Kutta condition.
5.1	
Force distribution on the slender body in the potential flow
The formalism of the slender body theory is based on the potential inviscid theory and asymptotic 
estimations (2.3). The governing equations are derived using the concept of the active cross section 
with the thickness ∆x  at the abscissa x (see Fig. 5.1). First, we consider the steady ship motion under 
a positive drift angle. Due to ship motion the ship frame in the cross section is moved with the velocity 
Vy = −V sin β  in y direction. The momentum of the flow in the cross section reads:
∆P = m′
22Vy∆x = −ρπC(x)T 2(x)V sin β∆x 
(5.1)
According to the momentum theorem, the transverse force acting on the frame of the doubled body at 
x is calculated through the time derivative of the momentum in the earth fixed reference system
∆Fy = −d(∆P)a
dt

Calculation of steady manoeuvring

The change of the flow momentum is caused by the change of the frame in the cross section due to motion 
with the velocity Vx = V cos β. The time derivative can be replaced by the derivative on x coordinate
dx = −V cos βdt ⇒dx
dt = −V cos β
∆Fy = −d(∆P)a

Herewith the derivative of the transverse force on x coordinate is:

∆x = −ρπd(C(x)T 2(x))

Since the drift angle is assumed to be small sin β ∼β, cos β ∼1 the last expression takes the form

Figure 5.2: Distribution of C(x)T 2(x) and of the transverse force (5.6) along the ship length
The distribution of  C(x)T 2(x)  and  dFy
dx   along the ship is presented in Fig.  5.2. The  C(x)T 2(x)  has 
maximum in the central part of the ship where the frame shapes are full, i.e. C(x) is maximum. In the 
bow and stern regions either C(x) = 0 or T 2(x) = 0. The derivative d(C(x)T 2(x))
dx
 and the force distribution 
dFy
dx  are maximal in bow and stern regions. In the central part along the ship length the C(x)T 2(x)=const 
and no force  dFy
cx =0 arises within this region. This force distribution is in accordance with the force 
scheme given in Fig. 2.2.

This moment is exactly equal to the Munk moment
MMunk = VxVy(m22 −m11) ≈V 2m22β  
(5.9)
what is quite expectable, because no other moment can arise during the steady motion.
Let us consider a more complicated ship motion with the drift angle and the angular velocity. The ship 
velocity V is kept constant. The presence of the angular velocity causes additional velocity in the each

where β(x) is the effective drift angle which is variable along the ship length. The formulae (5.6)–(5.7)

Improvement of the slender body theory. Kutta condition
At a glance the slender body theory is not practical because it is not capable predicting the transverse force. 
This problem can be overcome in a way similar to the famous Kutta condition introduced in the airfoil 
theory (see chapter 5.4 in Kornev (2009b)). As explained above the force arises due to a drastic change of 
the flow in the stern area (see Fig. 2.2b). This change is caused due to viscosity influence. The boundary 
layer is developed starting from the bow. The vortices of the boundary layer shed from the stern alter the 
flow. As a result the force acts only on the front part of the ship. According to the slender body theory it is 
assumed that the force arises within the ship section starting from the bow to the widest frame. This choice 
can be established using the similarity between the ship and the wing of small aspect ratio.
Let us consider the wing under a small angle of attack β (Fig. 5.4) and Ω = 0. Because the aspect ratio is 
small the flow around of any transversal wing section is nearly two dimensional like it is shown for section 
AB (see Fig. 5.4 a and b). The incident velocity is V sin β in each wing section. According to the vortex 
wing theory (see chapter 5 in Kornev (2009b)) each section contains transversal bound vortices generating 
the lift and free streamwise vortices which are necessary to make the transversal vortices closed at infinity. 
The traces of longitudinal free vortices in different cross sections along the wing are shown in Fig. 5.4c. To 
understand the vortex scheme better the reader is referred to the section 5.9.2.2 in Kornev (2009b). Both 
free and bound vortices induce the downwash to counterbalance the incident velocity V sin β . If the aspect 
ratio is small the contribution from the bound vortices can be neglected. Indeed, as said above, locally in 
each transversal section the wing acts on the fluid like a plate with infinite chord. The problem is quasi 
two dimensional at each x. The bound vortices in front of the section induce negative downwash velocities 
whereas the bound vortices behind the section induce the positive up wash velocity. Since the cross section 
is changed slowly the downwash and up wash contributions are nearly equal. The resulting velocity is zero. 
On the contrary the contribution of free vortices is significant. Each free vortex shed from the section at 
x propagates along the wing downstream and influences the sections downstream. The total intensity of 
free vortices is growing along the wing chord. The no penetration condition is satisfied in each section:

The local span B(x) is changed along the x axis. Let us assume that the no penetration condition was 
satisfied at x = x  and we proceed to the next section at x = x + ∆x . The next section has the span 
from −B(x + ∆x)/2 to B(x + ∆x)/2 consisting the old part from −B(x)/2 to B(x)/2 and new 
winglets [−B(x + ∆x)/2, −B(x)/2] and [B(x)/2, B(x + ∆x)/2]. The free vortices shed from the 
section at x would be able to satisfy the no penetration condition within −B(x)/2 to B(x)/2 . But they 
are not sufficient to satisfy the no penetration condition on the whole width from −B(x + ∆x)/2 to 
B(x + ∆x)/2. New free vortices have to arise at  x = x + ∆x . According to the fluid mechanics 
theorem the vortex lines should be the closed lines. It means that the appearance of the longitudinal 
vortices leads automatically to the appearance of the transversal bound vortices. They generate the lift 
in the section x = x + ∆x .

Calculation of steady manoeuvring  
forces using slender body theory
Let us consider now two sequential sections HG with the largest span and IJ. The span of IJ is either the 
same or smaller than that of HG. No new winglets arise. It is assumed that the flow does not follow the 
wing contour rather than separates at the section with the maximum width. The free vortices coming 
from the section HG are able to satisfy the no penetration condition on the whole span in the section 
IJ because they were able to do it on a larger span at x. No new free vortices are necessary. It means no 
bound vortices appear in the sections behind HG. Therefore, no lift is generated behind the section HG.
Generalizing this analysis to a slender body theory, it is assumed that the transverse force appears 
only on the ship part in front of the maximum width frame section at  xmax . This section can be 
identified as the section where the product C(x)T 2(x) is maximal. Therefore, the first term in (5.12) 
−ρπV 2 d(C(x)T 2(x))
dx
β  has to be integrated from xmax  to xB.
Let us consider now the case  β = 0, Ω̸= 0. In this case the no penetration condition reads:

The force arises due to two reasons. First, like in the case  β ̸= 0, Ω= 0 new free vortices arise in each 
section downstream due to change of the wing span. Second, the new free vortices appear because the 
right side of the equation (5.15) is changed along the wing chord. The first effect is described by the 
second term in (5.12)  ρπV 2 d(C(x)T 2(x))
dx

LΩ, whereas the second effect by the third term C(x)T 2(x) Ω
L  . 
The contribution of the term  ρπV 2Ω/Ld(C(x)T 2(x)x)
dx
  to the transverse force caused by the rotation is 
calculated as follows:
• between xmax  and xB  this term is realized in the full form  
ρπV 2Ω/Ld(C(x)T 2(x)x)

,
• behind the xmax  the second term in

is zero because the frames of the modified body are not changed behind xmax  due to flow separation 
at xmax  (compare sections HG, IJ and KL in Fig. 5.4c). It is assumed, that the oscillations of the ship 
wake are neglected at small ωz.

Forces on ship rudders
6	 Forces on ship rudders
Summary: Different rudder constructions used in shipbuilding are discussed in this chapter. General 
representation of forces arising on rudder at different conditions of ship motion is consdered. A special 
attention is paid to analysis of rudder-hull iand rudder-propeller interactions.
6.1	
Introduction
The ship rudders are wings with the small and moderate aspect ratio which is varied in the range between 
0.5 and 3.0. The relative thickness of rudders is between 10 and 30 per cent. The rudder area AR  is 
chosen from the following two conditions:
•  stability of the motion (see chapter 7),
•  required ship manoeuvrability.
The rudder design is performed in two steps. In the first design step the rudder area is chosen from the 
conditions of the motion stability and required manoeuvrability. In the second stage the structure of 
the rudder and the torque moment on the rudder stock are calculated. Typical ratios of the lateral ship 
area LT to the rudder area AR  are presented in table 6.1.

 Table 6.1: The ratio of the lateral ship area to the rudder area
The following aspects should be taken into account when hydrodynamics of the rudder is considered:
• To increase the rudder efficiency a part of the rudder is located in the propeller slipstream. 
In this case the rudder is also efficient at small and zero ship speeds.
• The slipstream induces not only the additional axial velocity but also additional transverse 
velocities on the rudder. As a result the local angle of attack of the rudder is varied between 
zero and 15 degrees even for a non-deflected rudder in the propeller slipstream.
• The rudder is located in the ship wake. Its hydrodynamics is strongly influenced by the 
wake.
• The upper side of the rudder is located close to the ship hull.
The ship hull has a positive effect on the transverse force arising on the rudder. If the gap between the hull 
and the rudder is zero, the effective aspect ratio of the rudder is twice the nominal value. The transverse 
force and the lift to drag ratio is getting larger. The explanation of this fact is illustrated in Fig. 5.17 
of the manuscript Kornev (2009b). Is the gap getting larger the positive effect quickly disappears. For 
customary gaps, the increase of the transverse force due to hull influence is only from five to ten percent.
The aim to improve the rudder efficiency motivated the engineers of the firm Becker Marine 
Systems (see (n.d.b)) to invent the twisted rudders (see Fig. 6.1):

Forces on ship rudders
“Conventional rudders are placed behind the propeller with the rudder cross section arranged 
symmetrically about the vertical rudder center plane. However, this arrangement does not consider the 
fact that the propeller induces a strong rotational flow that impinges on the rudder blade. This results 
in areas of low pressure on the blade that induce cavitation and associated erosion problems. To avoid 
cavitation and to improve the manoeuvrability performance of a full spade rudder, Becker has enhanced 
the development of twisted leading edge rudder types”,
Figure 6.1: Twisted leading edge rudder invented by Becker Marine System 2 (n.d.b)
Various rudder types have been developed over the years. A comprehensive overview of rudder types 
is given in Schneekluth (1988). Figure 6.2a shows the simplex balance rudder which is mounted on the 
closed frame (marked by the grey color). The rudder is rotated around the stock being the part of the 
frame. The rudder with heel bearing (simplex) (Fig. 6.2b) belongs to the cheapest and the most common 
rudder type formerly built. Since the heel increases the non-homogeneity of the ship wake what in its 
turn increases the propeller induced vibration, this type of rudders is used rarely, mostly it is applied 
for small boats and some fishery vessels. Spade rudder (Fig. 6.2c) is popular for ferries, ro-ro ships and 
special craft. Semi-balanced rudders (Fig. 6.2d) are used to reduce the bending moment acting on the 
rudder. To the most modern rudder types is the flapped rudder designed by Becker Marine Systems. 
The side force on the moving rudder can be sufficiently increased using the flap deflection (see Fig. 6.3).
Size and costs of the rudder engine are determined by the necessary maximum torque at the rudder stock. 
The stock moment is zero if the center of effort for the transverse rudder force lies on the rudder stock 
axis. That is why the rudder stock is usually displaced from the leading edge. The ratio of the rudder 
area in front of the stock to the total area varies in the range between 0.05 and 0.35.

Typical profile shapes of ship rudders are presented in Fig. 6.4 2 (n.d.b). The rudder profile is usually 
chosen from the following conditions
• the flow is non cavitating,
• The critical angle αcrit  corresponding to the stall effect is as large as possible,
• the drag to transverse force ratio is minimal.

One of the important problems of the rudder design is the minimisation of the ratio CxR/CyR . The 
transverse force coefficient is taken from measurements or calculations performed for the wing under 
the angle of the attack α which is equal to the efficient rudder deflection angle α = δR,eff . Since the 
lift coefficient is always positive at the positive α whereas the transverse force is negative at the positive 
rudder deflection angle δ the negative sign is additionally introduced in (6.2) to use  ˜CyR  directly from

Forces on ship rudders
The rudder is located in the region which is strongly influenced by the ship hull. The ship hull influence 
is expressed through the following effects:
• the incoming velocity is not equal to the ship velocity V rather than it equals to an effective 
velocity Veff ̸= V . The difference between V and Veff  is due two effects:
--
the velocity is decelerated because of the wake effect (1 −w)V , where w is the wake number.
--
the velocity on the rudder is accelerated by the propeller.
• the angle of attack is less than the angle of attack determined from pure geometric point of 
view (flow straightening effect).
Figure 6.5: Angle of attack of the rudder at different distances from the ship hull moving with the drift angle β:  
I – the rudder is very close to the hull, angle of attack is zero, II – intermediate position of the rudder, the angle 
of attack is between zero and β, III – the rudder is far from the hull, angle of attack is equal to ship drift angle β.

Forces on ship rudders
The first effect is discussed in the subsection 6.3. The second effect is illustrated in Fig. 6.5. If the rudder 
is very close to the hull, it is located in the area of the hydrodynamic shadow. The effective angle of 
attack is zero. If the rudder is far from the hull the influence of the hull can be neglected. The rudder is 
moving in the free stream. The angle of attack is equal to the ship drift angle β. In the intermediate case 
the angle of attack is between zero and β. The hull influence on the angle of attack is taken into account 
by the coefficient κ . The rudder angle without the hull influence is:
δR,eff = δR −(β −Ωxr
L ) 
(6.7)
The effective rudder angle with account for the hull influence reads:
eff
R,
δ
= δR −κ(β −Ωxr
L ) 
(6.8)
where xr  is the arm of the transversal force acting on the rudder.
The ship hull influence coefficient κ  can be found from the following empirical estimations:
•  κ = 0.3 if the rudder is located at the distance less than the half of the chord from the 
deadwood,
•  κ = 0.3 if the rudders are located on ship boards and its projection on the side view is 
crossed with the deadwood,
•  κ = 0.5 if the rudders are located at the distance larger than the half of the chord from the 
deadwood,
•  κ = 1.0 for ships without deadwood.
6.3	
Determination of the force coefficients
The force coefficients can be determined in wind tunnel tests, from RANS computations or from empirical 
formulae. The rudder is considered as a wing under the angle of attack α which is equal to the effective 
rudder angle δR,eff  (6.8). The effective velocity of flow to the rudder Veff  is determined in the next 
subsection. The angle of attack and the velocity Veff  are assumed to be constant on the whole rudder. 
For the angle of attacks less than the critical angle of attack αcrit  corresponding to the stall effect, the 
force and moment coefficients can be calculated from the approximation of the series of measurements 
performed by different authors (see Bertram (2000)):

The first term in the approximation for CyR  takes the linear part of the force into account, whereas 
the second a the nonlinear one. The coefficient CQ  is around 1.0 (CQ ≈1) for the rudders with sharp 
upper and lower edges. The first term in the approximation of CxR  is derived using the lifting line theory 
and the concept of the optimal wing with elliptical load distribution along the span. The second term 
takes the contribution of nonlinear effects arising due to the cross flow with the velocity V sin α  (see 
the subsection 4.1.3). The coefficient  CD0 is the surface friction calculated from the approximation 
CD0 = 2.5
0.075
(logRe−2)2 . The moment coefficient is calculated with respect to the leading edge of the rudder. 
If the leading edge is not vertical the position at the mean height of the rudder is used as a reference 
point. The aspect ratio is calculated as the chord c at the rudder mean height b/2 multiplied with span 
and divided by the rudder area AR , i.e. λ = bc(b/2)/AR . The Reynolds number uses the velocity, the 
mean chord C and the kinematic viscosity as the characteristic quantities: Re = VeffC/ν . The formulae 
are valid only up to the critical angle of attack αcrit.
6.4	
Interaction between the rudder and propeller
6.4.1	
Increase of the rudder force due to propeller slipstream
Since the rudder is located in the propeller slipstream, the flow around the rudder is accelerated (see 
Fig. 6.6a). The axial velocity is increased from the point A in front of the propeller to point D in the 
rudder region being continuous. Because of the flow acceleration the propeller slipstream experiences 
the contraction (see Fig. 6.6b). The pressure sinks in the front of the propeller due to the suction effect 
caused by the propeller (see Fig. 6.6c). The pressure in the propeller disc jumps from the value pB  to 
the value  pc, pc ∼pB . The propeller acts on the fluid as the energy source raising the pressure from 
pB  to  pc . The thrust on the propeller is T = A0(pc −pB), where A0 is the propeller disc area.
To find a simple estimation of the flow speed, it is assumed that the velocity is constant over the whole 
rudder area. Let us consider the Bernoulli equation along the streamline connecting four points A, 
B, C and D (see Fig. 6.7). A direct application of the equation is not allowed because the equation is valid 
if no energy is additionally put along the line. Since the propeller is the energy source, the Bernoulli 
equation can be applied separately between points A and B

Velocities VB  and VC  are equal VB = VC  since the velocity is continuous on the propeller disk. The

6.4.2	
Unbalanced lateral force due to propeller jet swirl
The propeller has a twofold effect on the rudder. First, the propeller accelerates the flow in the axial 
direction making the longitudinal velocity in the jet much larger than the advanced speed (6.17). The 
second effect of the propeller on the rudder is due to swirl of the propeller jet . The propeller produces 
not only additional longitudinal velocities but also additional circumferential velocities. The distribution 
of the circumferential velocity across the jet is asymmetric. The velocity in the upper part of the jet is 
slightly smaller due to the hull influence (reduction of the flow velocity due to viscous effect of solid 
walls, i.e. boundary layer effect). The circumferential velocity in the lower part of the propeller jet, where 
the influence of the hull is weaker, is larger.
The flow swirl is the reason for the inception of the additional unbalanced lateral force on the rudder 
placed into the propeller jet. This force arises even on non-deflected rudder. The direction of this force 
corresponds to the swirling direction, i.e. the additional lateral force is negative for right handed propeller.

Forces on ship rudders
This effect can easily be explained taking the fact into account that the rudder is both hydrodynamically 
and geometrically asymmetric. For a non-deflected rudder behind the right handed propeller, the 
swirling flow results in the negative lateral force in the upper part, whereas the positive force arises in 
the lower part of the rudder (see Fig. 6.8). Due to the hull and the free surface effects the force in the 
upper part of the rudder is larger than that in the lower one. The difference between two forces results 
in the unbalanced lateral force pushing the stern to starboard and turning the ship counter-clockwise.

Transversal forces and yaw moment on propeller
7	 Transversal forces and yaw 
moment on propeller
Summary: The study object of this chapter are lateral forces arising on propeller and hull due to hull – 
propeller interaction and horizontal and upward oblique flow.
Due to asymmetry of the incoming flow the propeller produces not only the thrust but also the transversal 
forces making the ship maneuvering more complicated. In this chapter we analyze a few hydrodynamic 
effects resulting in the transversal forces on propeller.

Additional transversal forces on propeller due to non-uniformity of the ship 
wake
The propeller is located in the ship wake. In the case of odd number of propellers installed on ship 
additional transverse force arises on the propeller due to non-uniformity of the ship wake . Schematic 
vertical distribution of the axial velocity in front of the propeller is shown in Fig. 7.1.
Non uniform distribution of the stream velocity results in the appearance of the transverse force and 
yaw moment. To illustrate the creation of the transverse force let us consider two profiles 1 and 2 on a 
four blades right-handed propeller (Fig. 7.2). The profiles are moving in circumferential direction with 
the local velocity ωr. The incoming stream has then velocity V = −ωr. Axial velocity in the ship wake 
ux  reduces the angle of attack  ϕ .
The typical dependence of the propeller profile drag on the angle of attack is shown in 7.2.
The induced angle of attack αI  is calculated as

Transversal forces and yaw moment on propeller
Considering consequently profiles in the upper blade and lower blade positions in the same manner 
as it has just been done above one can explain the creation of the transverse force caused by the non 
uniformity of the ship wake. The direction of the force depends on the propeller turning direction. 
The positive transverse force appears on the right handed propeller (Fig. 7.4 left), whereas the negative 
transverse force appears on the left handed propeller (Fig. 7.4 right).
Figure 7.4: Transverse force on the right handed (left) and left handed (right) propellers
7.2	
Additional transversal forces on propeller due to oblique flow
The transverse force arises on propeller in oblique flow, i.e. on propeller under the local drift angle 
caused by the ship drift motion and rotation with the angular velocity Ω. Let us β is the local drift angle 
in place of right handed propeller. To explain the creation of this force we consider the scheme similar 
to that shown in Fig. 7.2. The inflow on the propeller has a transverse component V sin β (see Fig.7.5).
The drag forces acting on the upper and lower profiles are
δY1τ = CD1ρA

(ωr + V sin β)2

δY2τ = −CD2ρA

where  CD   is the profile drag coefficient. Using the Taylor expansion (7.1) it is easy to show that 
CD1 > CD2 since αI1 > αI2. The magnitude of tangential force δY1τ  is larger than that of δY2τ  since 
CD1 > CD2 and (ωr + V sin β) > (ωr −V sin β). Considering consequently profiles in the upper 
blade and lower blade positions on the same manner as it has just been done above one can explain the 
creation of the positive transverse force caused by the oblique flow. The sum of these two components 
yields the transverse force which is not zero.
 Figure 7.6: Transverse force on the propeller in oblique flow
As seen in Fig.7.6 the additional forces arising due to oblique flow are stabilizing ones. This force produces 
the negative moment and reduces the reason of the oblique flow appearance, i.e. the drift angle and the 
angular velocity. We considered above the right handed propellers. The same conclusions can also be 
drawn for left handed propellers.
Additional forces due to oblique flow can be estimated from the formula:
∆Y = ρn2D4

2KQ (J = 0) −J dKQ

J tan β,
where n is the rotation number per second, D is the diameter of propeller, J  is the advance ratio, KQ  is 
the torque coefficient.

Moment on the propeller due to upward oblique flow at the propeller 
location
In the stern area of the ship the flow has upward direction as shown schematically in Fig. 7.7 and 7.8.

Transversal forces and yaw moment on propeller
Figure 7.8: Upward oblique flow in the ship stern area (as viewed from the stern)
As seen in Fig. 7.8 the incoming velocity of the blade profile 1 is less than that of the profile 2 for the 
right handed propeller. Therefore, the thrust produced by the profile in the position 2 is larger than that 
in the position 1. Fig. 7.9 illustrates this fact and explains the appearance of the moment resulting in 
the turning the boat counter-clockwise. The clockwise moment arises on the left handed propeller. The 
center of effort of the resulting thrust force is shifted towards the starboard. For the left handed propeller 
the center of effort is shifted towards the port side.

Transversal forces and yaw moment on propeller
Figure 7.9: Counter-clockwise moment on the right handed propeller arising due 
to upward oblique flow in the ship stern area
Let us consider the two screw ship. For two propellers rotating outwards the centers of effort of thrust 
forces are displaced from the propeller axes towards boards (see Fig. 7.10 a)). On the contrary, the centers 
of thrust forces are closer to the middle line plane for propellers rotating inwards (see Fig. 7.10 b)). The 
reason of these displacements is again the upward oblique flow resulting in different thrusts as explained 
above for the one screw ship (Fig. 7.7–7.9). If ship performs often maneuvering in small spaces using 
two propellers with different thrusts, the outward rotation (Fig. 7.10 a)) is more advantageous than the 
inward one since the arm of thrust forces is larger. Inward rotation is advantageous for ships maneuvering 
mostly by rudder action. The positive effect of propellers on the rudder installed amidships is larger 
when propellers rotate inwards.

7.4	
Additional moments on the propeller during manoeuvring
Different thrusts arise on two propellers in the turning circle. One propeller gets into the wake (dashed 
area) whereas the other moves in a free stream (see Fig. 7.11). The thrust of the propeller P can be 
substantially larger than that of the propeller S. This effect is reflected in the dependence of the moment 
coefficient
 mz  on the turning circle diameter referred to the ship length D/L for two ships (Fig. 7.12). The 
results were obtained experimentally for the bare hull (dashed line) and hull with propeller (solid line). 
One ship is a full bottomed ship with propellers located close to the hull. The second ship is a slender 
ship with two big propellers located relatively far from the hull. The reader is invited to recognize which 
ship is the ship A and which one is the ship B.
7.5	
Additional lateral force on the hull caused by propeller
A rotating propeller induces the transversal velocities both in the propeller jet and outside it. During 
the forward gear (motion) the effect of the propeller jet swirl on the hull is usually negligible. However, 
it can be very large for the reverse gear. Due to stagnation effects caused by the hull which is typical 
for all bodies and mostly of potential character the axial velocity is smaller in the upper part of the hull 
(see Fig. 7.13b) than in the lower one (Fig. 7.13a). Therefore, the angle of attack and the lateral force in 
the upper submerged part of the hull are larger than in the lower. The resulting unbalanced lateral force 
corresponds to the rotation direction.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Yaw stability
8	 Yaw stability
Summary: Linear Hurwitz analysis is utilized in this chapter to derive the condition of the ship stability 
with three degree of freedom. Influence of ship geometry on stability and regulations of the stability are 
analysed using simple estimations for forces taken from the slender body theory. Trajectories of a stable 
ship at straight course and in turning circle are presented.
8.1	
Introduction
The aim of this chapter is the study of the ship ability to perform the stable motion. The ship moves with 
constant speed at zero drift angle and zero angular velocity. At the time instant t=0 the ship experience 
perturbations
β =β∗,
Ω=Ω∗. 
(8.1)
If the drift angle and angular velocity after perturbations increase the ship motion becomes unstable. 
If β and Ω decay the ship motion is stable. The analysis of the perturbation evolution is performed under 
assumption that the drift angle β, angular velocity Ω and change of the speed are small, i.e.:
β ∼O(ε), Ω∼O(ε), V ′/V ∼O(ε) 
(8.2)
Please note that speaking about the stability we assume that the rudder and other control devices 
are not active.
8.2	
Linearization of the motion equations
The analysis is based on the linearized form of the equations (2.17)

Steady ship motion in turning circle
In this subsection we give simple estimations of the radius and the drift angle when ship performs a 
steady turning circle. The estimations are derived using the assumptions (7.2). Stable ship motion along 
the turning circle trajectory is described by two last equations in the system (7.4) taking two following 
facts into account:

• since the motion is steady, the time derivatives are zero  β′ = 0, Ω′ = 0,
• the turning circle manoeuvre implies application of the rudder. Therefore, the additional 
force – CY R  should be added to the r.h.s. of the y-equation and the additional moment 
mzR  to the r.h.s. of the Ω equation. The sign of the additional force is negative, since the 
positive rudder angle results in the negative transverse force.
The system (7.4) is then reduced to:

y Ω−CyR,

Regulation of the stability
The expression mβ
z C∗Ω
y
+ Cβ
y mΩ
z  is not a quantity to measure the stability. Rather the roots  p1 and 
p2 characterizing the rate of the perturbation decay can be considered as the stability measure. From 
one side, the ship has to be stable. From the other side, the ship may not be too stable, since in this case 
the ship is hardly to steer.
At present there is no widely accepted measure of the stability. Kleinau (Kleinau (2001)) proposes to 
regulate the position of the apparent center of rotation along the ship. The apparent center of rotation 
xD  is the point where the local incoming flow velocity is zero:
V (βc −Ωc
xD
L ) = 0 ⇒xD
L = βc
Ωc
 
(8.34)
It is assumed that the arm of the transverse force is L/2, i.e. mzR = −1
2CyR . Substitution (8.32) into 
(8.34) yields

(8.36)
The center of rotation should lie within the ship length behind the bow. Practical experience (see Kleinau 
(2001)) shows that the well steered stable ship has the center of rotation at xD = (0.3 ÷ 0.4)L

L = 0.3 ÷ 0.4 

Summary: This, one of the most important chapters of the book, is devoted to the experimental methods 
of ship manoeuvrability including turning circle, zig-zag, spiral, pull-out an stop tests. Experimental 
results are basis for the manoeuvrability diagram which illustrates the ship stability, controlability and

Stability at large drift angle and large angular velocity
Stability analysis at large drift angle  β∗ and angular velocity Ω∗ is performed in a similar way as the

y (β∗, Ω∗) are 
calculated at  (β∗, Ω∗)  and not at  (β∗= 0, Ω∗= 0)  as done previously. In this case the nonlinear 
effects are taken into account. For instance, the derivative of the transverse force on the drift angle looks

The term 2Cββ

dynamics qualitatively.
The ship which is unstable at (β∗= 0, Ω∗= 0) experiences an unstable motion, moves into the turning 
trajectory and arrives a stable motion state along a circle at certain (β∗, Ω∗), at which the ship becoming stable.
Without account for nonlinear terms the ship remains unstable at every drift angle and angular velocity.

showing the dependence of the angular velocity Ω (or the turning circle radius) on the rudder angle 
δR  (Fig. 9.3b). Each point along the curve Ω(δR) is the equilibrium point. At each equilibrium point 
the slope of the curve Ωf(β) is larger than that of the curve Ωm(β). Therefore, the ship is stable.

Experimental study of the manoeuvrability
Typical picture for the unstable ship is presented in Fig. 9.4a. Again, the crossing points are equilibrium 
points which are subdivided into stable points (filled circles) and unstable points (bars). At stable points 
the slope of the curve Ωf(β) is larger than that of the curve Ωm(β). The diagram 9.4a can be redrawn 
into the diagram of manoeuvrability (Fig. 9.4b). This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 9.4b. To map the 
plane Ω – β into the plane Ω−δR, each point corresponding to a certain rudder angle δR  in Ω – β 
 
plane is projected onto line δR = const  in Ω−δR  plane. The line corresponding to the equilibrium 
states has a typical S-shaped form for unstable ship.

The dynamic yaw stability can also be analyzed using dependencies of the dimensionless angular 
velocity Ω on the rudder angle which can be either calculated or obtained from the trial tests. Typical 
dependencies Ω(δR) are shown in Fig. 9.5 for the stable ship a) and unstable ship b). The ship is stable 
if the slope of the curve Ω(δR) is positive and vice versa the ship is unstable if  ∂Ω
∂δR < 0. The negative 
slope is observed at small rudder angles corresponding to small drift angles. At large rudder and drift 
angles the nonlinear components of force and moment secure the yaw stability as was already mentioned 
above. The derivative  ∂Ω
∂δR  characterizes the ship controllability. If the derivative  ∂Ω
∂δR  is zero, the ship is 
not steerable. The value of  ∂Ω
∂δR  should be large but restricted. The infinite derivative  ∂Ω
∂δR = ∞ is the 
sign of the yaw instability.
Figure 9.5: Manoeuvrability diagram
In the rudder angle range between  −δ∗
R < δ < δ∗
R  there exists three possible turning circles for the 
unstable ship. The ship is not steerable in this range. The ship oscillates between two angular velocities 
corresponding to stable states Ω0 and Ω1.
The manoeuvrability diagram can be used for solution of the following practical problems:
•
estimation of the ship stability from the condition
∂Ω
∂δR > 0.
•
estimation of the critical rudder angles −δ∗
R and δ∗
R from the
condition
∂Ω
∂δR = ∞,
•
estimation of the angular velocity and turning circle radius for
the given rudder angle. This task has unique solution only for
stable ships.
•

Experimental study of the manoeuvrability

Experimental manoeuvring tests
The manoeuvring properties of ships are validated in sea trials with full-scale ships. The tests are 
performed in deep, unrestricted water under calm environment conditions. The ship has the full load 
(summer load line draught) and even keel condition. The ship motion parameters are measured usually 
by GPS. The main manoeuvring tests are:
• turning circle test
• zigzag manoeuvre
• spiral manoeuvre
• pull-out manoeuvre
• stop manoeuvre
9.4.1	
Turning circle
The test is started from straight motion with the design speed. After that the rudder is deflected to an 
angle δR  and the speed is a little reduced due to increase of the resistance. The test is performed as 
long as the ship course angle is changed from zero to at least 540 degrees. The following parameters are 
measured in turning circle test:
• tactical diameter (see Fig. 9.6)
• maximum advance (see Fig. 9.6)
• transfer at 90° change of heading (see Fig. 9.6)
• times to change heading from 90° to 180°
• transfer loss of steady speed.
Typical tactical diameters lie in the range between 4.5–7 ship lengths for slender ships, 2.4–4 for short 
and full ships. Conventional ships have heel outwards in the turning circle. According to IMO regulations 
(Committee (2002))6 the advance should not exceed 4.5 ship lengths and tactical diameter should not 
exceed five ship lengths.
9.4.2	
Zigzag manoeuvre
The zigzag test is started from the straight motion with the design speed. The rudder is turned at δ∗
 degrees 
to the port side and is kept constant until the heading angle attains δ∗
 degrees to the port side. After 
that the rudder is deflected to δ∗
 degrees to the starboard and is kept constant until the heading angle 
attains the value δ∗ to the starboard. After that the whole procedure is repeated. Typical values of δ∗ are 
10 and 20 degrees.

Experimental study of the manoeuvrability
Figure 9.7: Parameters of the zigzag manoeuvre
Fig. 9.7 shows the parameters of the zigzag manoeuvre as given by Kleinau (Kleinau (2001)):
• initial turning time tA,
• time tU from the rudder reversion time instant to the time
• corresponding to the maximum heading angle,
• overshoot angle ΨU,
• period of the first heading oscillation.
According to Brix (Brix (1993)) the initial turning time  tA is about one to one and half of ship length 
travel time. The time tU lies in the range between 0.5 and 2 ship travel length time. The overshoot angle 
is between 5 and 15 degrees. Small values of  tA and ΨU  pointed out the big ship stability. According 
to IMO regulations (Committee (2002)) with the application of 10◦ rudder angle to port/starboard, 
the ship should not have traveled more than 2.5 ship lengths by the time the heading has changed by 
10◦ from the original heading.
According to IMO regulations (Committee (2002))7 the parameters of zig-zag test should fulfill the 
following conditions (taken from Committee (2002)):
• The value of the rst overshoot angle in the 10/10 zig-zag test should not exceed:

Spiral manoeuvre
The aim of the spiral test is the determination of data to draw the manoeuvring diagram Ω(δR) (see 
Fig. 9.5). At the beginning of the test the rudder is turned at the maximum deflection angle δRmax. As 
soon as the steady turning circle motion is attained the minimum turning radius, Rmin  corresponding 
to δRmax  is measured. The maximum angular velocity Ωmax  is calculated. The rudder angle is gradually 
decreased and R and Ω are determined for each rudder angle in steady circle motions. The procedure 
is repeated for the rudder angle range from δRmax  to -3 -5 degrees. Herewith, the right branch of the 
curve Ω(δR) is obtained. Then the tests are performed for the rudder angle range from −δRmax  to +3 
+5 degrees. The left branch of the curve Ω(δR) is obtained. For the stable ship both branches match 
each other. The diagram Ω(δR) is used to estimate the turning ability and yaw stability of the ship.

Pull-out manoeuvre
The full spiral test is time consuming and requires much place. The pull-out manoeuvre allows one to 
get the manoeuvrability diagram at reduced costs. At the beginning of the test the rudder is turned at 
the maximum deflection angle δRmax . The minimum turning radius Rmin  corresponding to δRmax  is 
measured. The maximum angular velocity Ωmax  is calculated. After that the rudder angle is set at zero 
and kept constant until a steady motion is attained. Then the rudder angle stepwise is decreased towards 
small negative values until the rotation direction is changed (Ω is getting negative). The right branch of 
the curve Ω(δR) is obtained. To get the left branch, the whole procedure is repeated beginning from 
−δRmax  through zero towards positive rudder angle values. The manoeuvrability diagram gained from 
the pull-out test is used only for the yaw stability analysis.
9.4.5	
Stop manoeuvre
At the beginning of this manoeuvre the engine is stopped and then reversed at full astern. The manoeuvre 
ends when the ship motion speed becomes zero. The stopping time and the stopping distance are 
measured. According to IMO regulations (Committee (2002))8 the stopping distance should not exceed 
15 ship lengths.

Influence of different factors on the manoeuvrability
10	 Influence of different factors on 
the manoeuvrability
Summary: Influence of different factors on the ship stability, controlability and manoeuvrability is shown. 
A special attention is paid to shallow water effects and wall influence.
10.1	
Influence of the seaway
The influence of the seaway on the ship stability can be detrimental if the ship speed is getting equal 
to the wave speed in following waves. The ship losses the stability, turns quickly perpendicular to the 
wave propagation direction. This effect disappears when the difference between the ship and wave 
speeds increases. In head waves the ship stability and manoeuvrability are sufficiently better than in the 
following waves.
10.2	
Shallow water effect
The shallow water effect takes place when the water depth is smaller than four ship draughts H < 4T . 
The shallow water influenced both the ship added mass and force acting on the ship. The added mass 
coefficients
¯k11 = m11 shallow water/m11 deep water,
¯k22 = m22 shallow water/m22 deep water
¯k66 = m66 shallow water/m66 deep water
are presented in Fig. 10.1. As seen the added mass are increased drastically due to shallow water effect. 
The transverse force is also increased. This effect can be easily explained by the blocking effect caused 
by the ship in shallow water. In this case each frame is streamed not in unrestricted flow but in a narrow 
channel as it is shown in Fig. 10.3. The frame blocks the flow in the channel. Obviously the force is 
much larger when the depth is small. The force and moment increase due to shallow water effects is 
illustrated in Fig. 10.2 and 10.3. The only non increasing derivative is the derivative of the force on the 
angular velocity CΩ
y . Very interesting is the dependence of the transverse force and the moment on the 
Fn number in shallow water (Fig.10.4). The measurement is performed for a merchant ship at H/T=3.5 
and angular velocity Ω= 0.67 deg/sec. Like in the deep water case the coefficients are independent 
on the Fn number at  Fn < 0.2. Critical effects take place when the Froude number based on the 
depth H attains the value around one FnH =
V
√gH ≈1. Similarly to the drag the transverse force and 
the yaw moment experiences jump-like behaviour around FnH =
V
√gH ≈1.

Influence of different factors on the manoeuvrability
Figure 10.4: Shallow water effect on the transverse force and yaw moment at different Fn  numbers (Voitkunsky (1985))
Consider the stable ship motion in the turning circle with the angular velocity  Ω  and the 
constant rudder angle. When the water depth is getting small, the term in the Y-force equation 
Cβ
y β +

CΩ
y −κx

Ω−CyR = 0  proportional to the angular velocity CΩ
y −κx  remains nearly 
constant (see Fig.10.2) whereas the term proportional to the drift angle Cβ
y  is substantially increased. 
The equilibrium is then possible when the drift angle β decreases. Indeed, the drift angle during the turning 
circle motion is much smaller than on the deep water (see Fig.10.5). Reduction of the drift angle results in 
the decrease of the ship speed drop. Figure 10.6 displaying the dependence κv = speed in shallow water
speed in deep water  on 
the angular velocity gained from full-scale measurements supports this fact. As to the moment equation 
mβ
z β + mΩ
z Ω+ mzR = 0, both terms proportional to  Ω  and  β  increase sufficiently. According to 
considerations above the drift angle is getting smaller when the ship comes to the shallow water. The 
term  mβ
z β   is changed weakly because the decrease of  β  is counterbalanced by the increase of the 
moment derivative mβ
z . To counterbalance the increase of the derivative mΩ
z  and to hold the balance 
in moments, the angular velocity should also become small. Therefore, the angular velocity decreases 
when the water depth is getting smaller at  H →0. The turning circle radius increases when  H →0. 
The turning ability of ship is getting worse in shallow water. It is illustrated in Fig. 10.7 showing the 
dependence κΩ= Ωin shallow water
Ωin deep water  on T/H ratio.

The shallow water has negative effect on the yaw stability. Fig. 10.8 shows the manoeuvrability diagram

manoeuvre is also influenced by the shallow water effects. Particularly, the overshoot angle is decreased

Influence of the wall on a mooring ship
Figure 10.7: Shallow water effect on the reduction of the angular velocity in turning circle  
(Voitkunsky (1985))
This effect takes place when the distance between the wall and the ship is smaller than four ship widths 
H < 4B. When the ship is moving close to the wall (Fig. 10.9) additional force and moment arise due 
to interaction between the wall and the ship. When the angle between the wall and the ship ϕ is small 
the flow channel between the ship and the wall is getting narrow. According to the continuity equation 
the flow is accelerated between the ship and the wall. From Bernoulli equation follows, that an under 
pressure region occurs between the ship and the wall. In the bow region the transverse force Y1 is positive 
whereas a strong negative suction force Y2 appears in the region of the minimum distance between 
the ship and the wall. Usually at small  φ
 Y2 > Y1 and the ship experiences the attraction effect. The 
resulting moment is positive and leads to the ship motion away from the wall. At large angles ϕ both 
the resulting force and the moment are positive and displace the ship away from the wall. At each ϕ the 
operator has to put much effort to hold the ship parallel to the wall.

Influence of the inclined wall or of inclined bottom
The same effects as in the case of the wall are observed in cases of the inclined wall or of inclined bottom. 
The difficulties of ship control are illustrated in Fig. 10.10 showing the rudder angle necessary to hold 
the ship on a given course in shallow water at different speeds. The Froude number FnH  is based on 
the speed and water depth, i.e. FnH = V/√gH. At small H and velocities the ship can become fully non 
steerable and moves in direction of the water depth enlargement.

Application of computational fluid  
dynamics for manoeuvrability problems
11	 Application of computational 
fluid dynamics for 
manoeuvrability problems
Summary: The chapter is devoted to the description of modern numerical techniques to calculate the 
forces acting on manoeuvring ships. The ship fixed forms of the Navier-Stokes and URANS equations 
are derived. Problems of grid generation and moving grid technologies are discussed.
11.1	
Introduction
As discussed above the viscous effects play a deciding role on the forces arising during the ship 
manoeuvering. At present the conventional methods based on experimental force determination and 
their approximations (see Chapter 4) are still the main instrument in manoeuvrability study. Since the 
accuracy of the mathematical model is still not satisfactory, the experimental methods will remain as 
the main tool of force determination for the next relatively long term. However, last decades much 
effort is put in the development and validation of computational fluid dynamics methods (CFD) for 
manoeuvering purposes. These methods are very attractive because they are general and don’t need any 
kind of linearizations with respect to the drift angle, yaw velocity, etc. They allow to perform six degree 
of freedom coupled calculations and investigate the interaction between the different ship motions on 
manoeuvrability characteristics. Also the seaway influence on manoeuvrability can be taken into account.
The CFD methods are used at present in two ways. First they can be used for the force determination for 
particular ship motions. For instance, the forces are determined when the ship has only the drift angle 
or only the yaw velocity. The coupled motions within the framework of the PMM or circular motion 
test methodology can also be studied. Such numerical tests are referred to the CFD based or numerical 
PMM tests. The forces are then determined like in PMM tests, approximated in form of, say, Abkowitz 
representation (4.13). The approximations are used then in motion simulations like it done in the code 
Manis (http://www.lemos.uni-rostock.de/lehre/schiffstheorie-i/).
Otherwise, the CFD methods are used to calculate both the dynamics (solution of ordinary differential 
equations (1.13)) and fluid dynamics equations (usually Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes 
Equations) in a coupled manner. At each time instant the forces are calculated from the Navier Stokes 
Equation and then used to alter the kinematic parameters. Such CFD applications are refereed to as the 
6DOF (six degree of freedom) procedure. Application of the 6DOF procedure does not imply the use 
of classical hydrodynamic mass which become not necessary.

(11.1)
The forces Fx, Fy, Fz  and moments Mx, My, Mz  are subdivided into three components:
• forces and moments caused by gravity effects,
• hydrodynamic forces and moments,
• forces and moments arising on propellers.
Fx = mg cos α1 + Fxn + Fxp,
Fy = mg cos α2 + Fyn + Fyp,
Fz = mg cos α3 + Fzn + Fzp,
Mx = mg(cos α3yg −cos α2zg) + Mxn + Mxp,
My = mg(cos α1zg −cos α3xg) + Myn + Myp,
Mz = mg(cos α2xg −cos α1yg) + Mzn + Mzp.

(11.2)
Here  αi  are the angles between the corresponding axis and the vector of the ship gravity force. In 
principle the hydrodynamic forces and propeller forces can be calculated as the total force in CFD. In 
some works (see, for instance, Cura Hochbaum and Vogt (2003)) the propeller contribution to forces 
and moments are calculated separately using a simple model.

URANS equations in ship fixed coordinate system
The hydrodynamic forces are calculated by direct integration of normal and shear stresses over the wetted 
ship area. The stresses are found from the fluid dynamics equations which are written in the ship fixed 
coordinate system.
The Reynolds averaged equations are supplemented by additional terms taking the acceleration, 
translation and rotation of the reference frame into account.
Let us ⃗i,⃗j,⃗k  is a triad of orthogonal unit vectors fixed in the moving frame. Any vector  ⃗W  can be 
written through the projections  ⃗W = W1⃗i + W2⃗j + W3⃗k. The change of  ⃗W occurs as a result of both 
change of components W1, W2, W3 in the moving frame and change of the unit vectors ⃗i,⃗j,⃗k

Computational grids
The quality of the grid has a strong impact on the accuracy of numerical prediction. The change of the cell 
topology within the computational domain should be smooth especially at the border between different 
grid blocks. The grid resolution should be high especially in areas of boundary layers and close to the 
free surface. For this sake the special refinement is used in these areas. To increase the accuracy of the 
computations in boundary layers one uses special grid boundary layers close to walls. Some samples of 
the grid for the combatant ship are presented in Fig. 11.2 (cartesian block structured grid) and Fig. 11.3 
and 11.4 (unstructured grid).

Application of computational fluid

To get impression on sizes of the computational domain, we presents typical data taken from a CFD 
calculation of manoeuvrability (Guilmineau et al. (2008)): in X direction the computational domain is 
from -2L to 3L (L is the ship length), the ship is from -0.5L to 0.5L, in the transversal direction from -L 
to 2L, in vertical direction from 0.2L to -1.5L. The resolution is chosen from the condition y+ ≈1 for 
the model scale and  y+ ≈100 for the full scale.
11.3.1	
Overset or Chimera grids
For complicated ship forms one uses overset or Chimera grids. The idea of chimera or overset grids is 
to generate the grids separately around each geometrical entity in the computational domain. After that 
the grids are combined together in such a way that they overlap each other where they meet. The crucial 
operation is an accurate transfer of quantities between the different grids at the overlapping region. 
The most important advantage of the overset or Chimera grid is the possibility to generate high quality 
structured particular grids separately for hull, rudder, propeller, appendages completely independent of 
each other, without having to take care of the interface between grids (Fig. 11.5 and 11.6). The experience 
shows that the grid number necessary for rudder and propeller models is approximately as large as for 
the whole hull.

11.3.2	
Morphing grids
Very efficient way of complicated ship motion modeling is the use of moving or morphing grids (Turnock 
et al. (2008)). The idea is the computational grid is moved in accordance with the displacement of the 
body by using an analytical weighted regridding which is a type of extrapolation of rigid transformation. 
For instance, in order to replicate the sway motion produced in the experimental PMM tests the ship 
geometry moves within the domain, deforming the mesh. The possible problem of morphing grid is poor 
quality caused by its motion. Consequently if the mesh surrounding the vehicle is allowed to deform the 
elements around the vehicle deform. This can quickly lead to poor quality elements if care is not taken. 
An alternative method is to replicate the motion of the vessel with the fluid domain split into an inner 
and outer region. The outer domain remains fixed in space while the inner domain containing the hull 
moves laterally to replicate the motion induced by a PMM. The mesh in the inner sub domain remains 
locked in position relative to the lateral motion of the vessel. This prevents deformation of the detailed 
mesh around the vessel. The outer mesh is deformed due to the motion of the inner region.
If moving grids are used the Navier Stokes should be transformed to take the velocity of grid faces

Where U and S are respectively volume and surface of cells. The equation (11.14) is derived from the 
condition that the computation of the control volumes or of the grid velocities must be performed in a 
such a way that the resulting numerical scheme preserves the state of the uniform flow, independently of 
the deformation of the grid. The equation (11.14) is satisfied automatically if the control volumes don’t 
change their shape. The Geometric conservation law (11.14) should solve coupled with other fluid flow 
equations using the same discretizations schemes.

12	 Dynamics and Stability of Wing 
in ground effect craft (WIG)
Summary: The chapter is optional. The subject is the aerodynamics, dynamics and stability of wing in 
ground effect craft (WIG). General six degree of freedom (6DOF) motion equations are derived. Hurwitz 
linear analysis is applied for derivation of criterion of the longitudinal stability. WIG static stability is 
analysed using the criterion proposed by Irodov. The WIG design requirements are formulated.
12.1	
Introduction
The Wing-In-Ground craft (WIG), called also ekranoplan and Ground Effect Machine (GEM), is a 
high-speed low-altitude flying vehicle that utilizes a favourable ground effect. This effect appears at 
about one wing chord distance from the ground and results in an enhanced lift-drag ratio. As a means 
for transportation, WIG is positioned in the niche between ships and aircraft: speeds of WIG are much 
higher than those of ships, and operational expenses are much lower than those of airplanes. Another 
advantage of most WIG vehicles is their amphibious properties; moreover, they can take off and land 
on any relatively flat surface, such as land, water, snow, and ice. Military WIG craft fly below the air 
defence radars’ zone, and are invulnerable to mine-torpedo weapons. The usage of the ground effect has 
also been discovered in nature: birds and flying fish spend less energy moving in the vicinity of water 
surfaces Belavin (1977).
The most significant contribution to the progress of the WIG concept was made in Russia by the Central 
Hydrofoil Design Bureau under the guidance of R.E. Alekseev, who developed a number of unique test 
craft (the series SM and the famous Caspian Monster KM), as well as the first serial vehicles of Orlyonok 
(Fig. 12.1) and Lun types. Two generations of ekranoplans were constructed and successfully tested 
Maskalik et al. (1998). Due to a low commercial potential of these craft designed for the Navy and a 
high cost of the development, large ekranoplans did not find practical application in the new economic 
and political situation of the last decade. At the present time, more attention is paid to the development 
of manually controlled small craft (Amphistar, FS8, Hoverwing, Hydrowing, TAF and Chinese craft) 
(see (n.d.c)). The ground effect, resulting in the considerable increase of the lift and the lift-drag ratio, 
makes the efficiencies of these WIG vehicles higher than those of the other transportation means in the 
speed range from 60 mph to 300 mph. The recent success of the FS8 vehicle, designed by German firm 
AFD Fischer and Matjasic (1998), raises a hope that WIG craft will find their niche in the transportation 
system in the near future.

Unique characteristics of the WIG concept make it a suitable platform for various tasks. The use of 
WIG craft has been studied for rescue operations in the ocean and as a first stage in the sea-based 
launch of reusable aerospace planes (Aframeev (1998) Tomita et al. (1996)). Boeing Phantom Works 
has recently announced a project to develop a high-capacity cargo plane using ground effect for military 
and commercial purposes (Cole (2002)).9

Criterion of the static stability of WIG craft and hydrofoils
Let us the position 1 of the wing in ground effect craft is the equilibrium state. The hight of flight is h1 and 
the trim angle  ψ1. Due to perturbations the trim angle increases and attains the value  ψ2 (position 2). 
The increase of the trim angle results in the increase of the lift what, in its turn, leads to the growth of 
the height of flight. The WIG runs to the new position 3 which is equilibrium state for the lift force, but 
not for the moment. If the moment in the position 3 is negative, the trim angle can decrease and the 
WIG craft is able to return to the original position 1. The WIG is statically stable, otherwise statically 
unstable. The criterion of the statical stability can in this case derived from these considerations.
Figure 12.2: Illustration to derivation of the criterion of the WIG statical stability
Generally, the lift coefficient and the moment coefficient have the following representations neglecting 
nonlinear terms:
Cl = Cl1 + Cψ
l (ψ −ψ1) + Ch
l (h −h1)
(12.1)
mz = mψ
z (ψ −ψ1) + mh
z(h −h1)
(12.2)
where Cl1 is the lift coefficient at the position 1. Since the position 3 is the force balance state, the force 
increment due to trim increase is counterbalanced by the force decrease due to growth of the height of 
flight
Cψ
l (ψ2 −ψ1) + Ch
l (h3 −h1) = 0

l δψ + Ch
l δh = 0

the WIG is statically stable. Expressing δψ  from (12.3) δψ = −Ch

yields the formula

The arm of forces arising due to change of the height of flight is located in front of the arm of forces 
arising due to change of the trim angle:
Xh > Xψ
The arm of forces due to h change is referred as to the aerodynamic center in height, whereas the arm due 
to change of the trim is referred as to the aerodynamic center in pitch. The same form has the criterion 
of the static stability of the hydrofoil ship.

Representation of forces in WIG aerodynamics
Classical aerodynamics is based on the representation of forces and moments in form of Taylor series. 
For instance the force Cy  can be represented for airplanes as:
Cy(α, t) = C0
y(α0) + ∂Cy
∂α (α0)(α(t) −α0) + ∂Cy
∂˙α (α0) ˙α(t)b
Ua
+ ... 
(12.6)
Here α = α(t) is the angle of attack, Ua = const is the relative speed, ˙α =
dα(t)
dt
 and b  is the mean 
aerodynamic chord. Details can be found in any textbooks on airplane aerodynamics. This representation 
can formally be extended to the case of flight near the ground:
Cy(α, h, t) = C0
y(α0, h0) + ∂Cy
∂α (α0, h0)(α(t) −α0) + ∂Cy
∂h (α0, h0)(h(t) −h0)+
∂Cy
∂˙α (α0, h0) ˙α(t)b
Ua
+ ∂Cy
∂˙h
(α0, h0)
˙h(t)
Ua
+ ....
(12.7)
As shown by Prof. Treshkov in the late of sixties (see, for instance, [25]) the representation (12.7) is not 
convenient for the ground eect aerodynamics. He proposed to replace the angle of attack α by the pitch 
angle ϑ.  The force representation (12.7) takes the form:
Cy(ϑ, h, t) = Cy(ϑ, h) + ∂Cy
∂˙ϑ
(ϑ, h)
˙ϑ(t)b
Ua
+ ∂Cy
∂˙h
(ϑ, h)

For determination of speed characteristics of engines it is necessary to specify the table of speeds 
of motion (within expected range of motion speed); the table of regimes of operation (degree 
of throttling of engines). The table should be given in the range from εs.m  to εmax, where
εs.m –  regime of ‘‘light throttle "(usually εs.m =  0:4); εmax –  maximal regime of operation

 Figure 12.3: Coordinate systems
The choice of coordinate system for formulation of equation of dynamics is defined by requirements 
of simplicity of form and convenience in presentation of forces. Most appropriate in this sense is the 
semi-fixed system of coordinates. In what follows a general complete system is presented of equations 
of three-dimensional motion

Thrust of the engines is represented as a sum of a mean thrust and additional thrust due to work of the 
pilot:
Tb2 = Tbnb + ∆Tb (t) ,
Ts2 = Tsns + ∆Ts (t) ,
The problem of determination of transfer coecients is a separate problem. These coecients are selected 
depending on aerodynamic conguration and design particulars.
It is assumed here that the eciency of control surfaces is the same in manual and automatic modes. In 
case this eciency is dierent the above equations are easily modied.
Thrust of the front and rear engines 
Tb  and 
Ts  is determined from functions 
Ts (U, ε) and Tb (U, ε) for U = Ua, ε = εb0 and ε = εs0
)
f
 (so called speed characteristics). 
Determination of aerodynamic characteristics of air wings in semi-xed coordinate system can be 
performed using the program Autowing [4]. The second derivative m
¨h
z  can be approximately assumed 
equal m ˙α
z  of horizontal tail plane.
12.5.3	
Evaluation of longitudinal stability
Additional input data are derivatives of aerodynamic characteristics Cx, Cy  and mz with respect to 
parameters ϑ, h, δf, δe,  as well as derivatives of thrust force with respect to speed T U
b , T U
s .
Stability is determined through analysis of roots of characteristic equation of linearized system describing 
longitudinal perturbed motion. The linearized system of longitudinal motion can be represented in the 
following form [36]:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Introduce dierentiation operators:

Replacing derivatives of  ight parameters p and grouping terms proportional to flight parameters, obtain 
the system of algebraic equations with respect to

Calculating this determinant obtain characteristic equation of the system in the form:
D5p5 + D4p4 + D3p3 + D2p2 + D1p + D0 = 0
This equation is quintic and has 5 roots.
Necessary and sucient conditions of stability are [36]:
Di > 0, (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ; D1D2 −D3 > 0;
R5 = (D1D2 −D3) (D3D4 −D2D5) −(D1D4 −D5)2 > 0
The boundary of dynamic (oscillatory) stability is determined by equation R5 = 0, and the boundary 
of static (aperiodic) stability D5 = 0with other conditions of stability being fullled.
12.5.4	
Requirements for aerodynamic design of WIG craft
From condition of static stability the dierence in position of aerodynamic center in height and 
aerodynamic center in pitch ∆x = xh −xϑ  should be positive which determines the lower bound 
∆x.  The upper bound is determined by requirements of dynamic stability.

Dynamic s a nd Stabil ity of  Win g in gro und ef fect craft  (WIG
Stability is considerably dependent upon reciprocal position of aerodynamic centers and center of mass 
of the vehicle (see [24]). Consider static equations, determining design regime of motion:
Cy (h, ϑ) ρU0
2
2
S = m0g;
mz (h, ϑ) ρU0
2
2
Sb = 0;
Let U,h and ϑ have small increments δU, δh and δϑ and suppose that the vehicle passes over to a new 
position close to the previous state of equilibrium. Using expansions:
Cy = C0
y (h, ϑ) + Cy
hδh + Cy
ϑδϑ
mz = m0
z (h, ϑ) + mz
hδh + mz
ϑδϑ
we can obtain after some simple calculations the criterion of binding to the ground:
dh
dU = −2
U0
C0
y
Cy
h
xϑ
xϑ −xh
For a statically stable ekranoplan the following equation is valid:
sign dh
dU = −signxϑ
When the engine thrust is increased it is required that boat be increasing the flight height. The latter 
is possible only if the aerodynamic center in pitch is behind the center of mass. Performing similar 
calculations we obtain the following criterion:
dϑ
dU = −2
U0
C0
y
Cy
ϑ
xh
xh −xϑ
wherefrom it follows that, if the aerodynamic center in height is located behind the center of mass, then 
the increase of thrust would result in decrease of pitch angle. When under action of wind the vehicle 
should not signicantly change  ight height and pitch angle. This requirement can be fullled if we restrict 
value of criterion of “binding’’ to the ground.

Dynamic s a nd Stabil ity of  Win g in gro und ef fect craft  (WIG
Thus, accounting for dynamic criteria we can formulate the following requirements to design of air wing 
conguration in cruise:
• Securing of a given C0
y,
• Ensuring of maximal lift to drag ratio,
• Ensuring of positive dierence of aerodynamic centers bounded from above,
• Aerodynamic center in pitch should be located behind the center of mass at a small distance 
which minimizes the criterion of binding to the ground 
• Satisfaction of conditions of dynamic (oscillatory) stability, which for a small 
value of dierence in position of aerodynamic centers can be written as follows: 
D3D4 −D2D5 > 0.
Detailed analysis of WIG dynamics and stability can also be found in [24].

Exercises
Investigate the static and dynamic stability of the WIG craft Seawing using the code Autowing. The 
results should be represented as function of the flight height and pitch angle.

Appendix A Theory of irrotational flow
14	 Appendix A	 Theory of 
irrotational flow
Definitions. If the vorticity is zero ⃗ω = ∇× ⃗u = 0  and the flow is inviscid the velocity can be expressed 
through the gradient of the scalar function ϕ called the potential:
⃗V = gradϕ = ∇ϕ 
(A.1)
In Cartesian coordinate system the velocities are:
Vx = ∂ϕ
∂x;
Vy = ∂ϕ
∂y ;
Vz = ∂ϕ
∂z . 
(A.2)
Such flow is called as the irrational or potential flow. The potential has to satisfy the Laplace equation
∆ϕ = ∂2ϕ
∂x2 + ∂2ϕ
∂y2 + ∂2ϕ
∂z2 = 0. 
(A.3)
which is derived by substitution of formulae (A.2) into the continuity equation
div⃗V = 0 
(A.4)
div⃗V = divgradϕ = ∇∇ϕ = ∆ϕ = 0 ⇒∆ϕ = 0. 
(A.5)
The boundary conditions for the Laplace equation (A.3) are as follows:
• no penetration on the ship surface S
Vn = ∂ϕ
∂n

S
= Vn body. 
(A.6)
where ⃗n  is the normal vector to the ship surface S, Vn body is the local normal component 
of the body velocity at the surface point.

Appendix B Mirror principle
15	 Appendix B	 Mirror principle
If the free surface deformation is small at small Fn number the free surface can be considered as a rigid 
wall. If can be demonstrated using the mixed boundary condition
∂2ϕ
∂t2 + g∂ϕ
∂z = 0
in the nondimensional form:
UL
T 2
∂2 ˜ϕ
∂˜t2 + UL
L g
∂˜ϕ
∂˜z = 0 ⇒
 L

U 2
gL
∂2 ˜ϕ
∂˜t2 + ∂˜ϕ
∂˜z = 0
where ˜ϕ = ϕ/UL, ˜z = z/L, ˜t = t/T.
Introducing the Strouhal number Sh =
L
UT  and Fn number Fn = V/√gL  we obtain:
Sh2
φ
Fn2
φ
∂2 ˜ϕ
∂˜t2 + ∂˜ϕ
∂˜z = 0
For restricted Sh < ∞ and small Fn →0 we get the condition
∂˜ϕ
∂˜z = 0
on the free surface.
The last equation is the no-trough condition satised at rigid walls in inviscid flows. This condition can 
easily be satised for plane wall using the mirror principle which is illustrated in Fig. B.1. 
The flow around the cylinder alone is presented in Fig. B.1(left). If an additional cylinder is placed below 
at the height y = −h
d
d
 the line y = 0 is then a streamline Fig. B.1(right) and can be considered as a 
rigid wall within the inviscid flow theory.
