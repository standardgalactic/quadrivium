 Small Signal Audio Design
This much expanded second edition of Small Signal Audio Design is the essential and unique 
guide to the design of high-quality analogue circuitry for preamplifiers, mixing consoles, and 
many other signal-processing devices. You will learn to use inexpensive and readily available 
parts to obtain state-of-the-art performance in all the vital parameters of noise, distortion, 
crosstalk, etc. This practical handbook provides an extensive repertoire of circuit blocks from 
which almost any type of audio system can be built.
Essential points of theory that determine practical performance are lucidly and thoroughly 
explained, with the mathematics at an absolute minimum. Virtually every page reveals 
nuggets of specialized knowledge not found elsewhere. Douglas’ background in design for 
manufacture ensures he keeps a wary eye on the cost of things. 
Learn how to:
 • Make amplifiers with apparently impossibly low noise 
 • Design discrete circuitry that can handle enormous signals with vanishingly low distortion 
 • Use ordinary bipolar transistors to make amplifiers with an input impedance of more 
than 50 Megohms 
 • Transform the performance of low-cost-opamps, and how to make filters with very 
low noise and distortion 
 • Make incredibly accurate volume controls 
 • Make a huge variety of audio equalisers 
 • Make magnetic cartridge preamplifiers that have noise so low it is limited by basic 
physics 
 • Sum, switch, clip, compress, and route audio signals effectively 
 • Build reliable power-supplies, with many practical ways to keep both the noise and the 
cost down 

This much enlarged second edition is packed with new information, including completely 
new chapters on:
 • Opamps for low voltages (down to 3.3 V)
 • Moving-magnet inputs: archival and non-standard equalisation, for 78s etc.
 • Moving-magnet inputs: discrete transistor circuitry
 • Moving-magnet inputs: noise and distortion
 • Balance and width controls
 • Headphone amplifiers, including Class-A designs
There is also new material on: using multiple components to improve accuracy, ultra-linear 
discrete opamps, RIAA optimisation, the Baxandall volume control, distributed volume 
controls, loudness controls, the ideal balance-control law, instrumentation amplifier inputs, 
ground-cancelling outputs, zero-impedance outputs, and system control by microcontrollers.
This book includes numerous circuit blocks with component values so you can build them at once 
and easily adapt them to your particular requirements. It is lavishly illustrated with diagrams and 
graphs, and full of practical measurements on real circuitry using state-of-art testgear.

 Scientia potentia est 
 ‘Another damned thick book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble! Eh, Mr. Gibbon?’ 
 Attributed to Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in 1781 upon receiving the second 
volume of  The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire from its author. 
 This book deals with small-signal audio design; the amplification and control of audio in the 
analogue domain, where the processing is done with opamps or discrete transistors, usually 
working at a nominal level of a volt or less. It constitutes a major update of the first edition, 
being some 50% longer. ‘Small-signal design’ is the opposite term to the ‘large-signal design’ 
which in audio represents power amplifiers driving loudspeakers, rather than the electricity 
distribution grid or lightning. 
 There is unquestionably a need for high-quality analogue circuitry. For example, a good 
microphone preamplifier needs a gain range from 0 to 80 dB if it is to get any signal it is 
likely to encounter up to a workable nominal value. There is clearly little prospect of ever 
being able to connect an A-to-D converter directly to a microphone. The same applies to 
other low-output transducers such as moving-coil and moving-magnet phono cartridges. 
If you are starting at line level, and all you need is a simple but high-quality tone control, 
there is little incentive to convert to digital via a relatively expensive ADC, perform the very 
straightforward arithmetic manipulations in the digital domain, then go back to analogue via 
a DAC; there is also the need to implement the actual controls as rotary encoders and have 
those overseen by a microcontroller. All digital processing involves some delay, because it 
takes time to do the calculations; this is called the latency and can cause serious problems if 
more than one signal path is involved. 
 The total flexibility of digital signal processing certainly allows greater scope – you might 
contemplate how to go about implementing a one-second delay in the analogue domain, for 
example – but there are many times when greater quality or greater economy can be obtained 
by keeping the signal analogue. Sometimes analogue circuitry connects to the digital world, 
and so a complete chapter of this book deals with the subtleties of analogue/digital interfacing. 
 Preface 

Preface xxiii
 Therefore analogue circuitry is often the way to go. This book describes how to achieve high 
performance without spending a lot of money. As was remarked in a review of my recent 
book  Active Crossover Design , duplicating this performance in the digital domain is not at all 
a trivial business. You can, of course, start off in analogue, and when you have identified the 
filter slopes, equalisation curves, and what-not that you want it is relatively easy to move it 
over to the DSP world. 
 I have devoted the first few chapters to the principles of high-quality, small-signal design, 
moving on to look closely at first hifi preamplifiers, and then mixing consoles. These two 
genres were chosen partly because they are of wide interest in themselves, but also 
because they use a large number of different functional blocks, with very little overlap 
between them. They cover a wide range of circuit functions that will be useful for all kinds 
of audio systems. You will find out how to adapt or design these building-blocks for audio, 
and how to put them together to form a system without bad things happening due to loading 
or interaction. You should then be able to design pretty much anything in this field. 
 In the pursuit of high quality at low cost, there are certain principles that pervade this 
book. Low-impedance design reduces the effects of Johnson noise and current noise 
without making voltage noise worse; the only downside is that low impedance requires an 
opamp capable of driving it effectively, and sometimes more than one. The most ambitious 
application of this approach so far has been in the ultra-low noise Elektor 2012 Preamplifier. 
 Another principle is that of using multiple components to reduce the effects of random noise. 
This may be electrical noise, in which case the outputs of several amplifiers are averaged 
(very simply, with a few resistors) and the noise from them is partially cancelled. Multiple 
amplifiers are also very useful for driving the low impedances just mentioned. Alternatively, 
it may be numerical noise, such as tolerances in a component value – making up the 
required value with multiple parts in series or parallel also makes errors partially cancel. 
This technique has its limits because of the square-root way it works; four amplifiers or 
components are required to half the noise, sixteen to reduce it to a quarter and so on. 
 There is also the principle of ‘optimisation’, in which each circuit block is closely scrutinised 
to see if it is possible to improve it by a bit more thinking. One example is the optimisation of 
RIAA equalisation networks. There are four ways to connect resistors and capacitors to make 
an RIAA network, and I have shown that one of them requires smaller values of expensive 
precision capacitors than the others. This new finding is presented in detail in  Chapter 8 , 
along with related techniques of optimising resistor values to get convenient capacitor values. 
 In many places, hybrid amplifiers combining the virtues of discrete active devices and 
opamps are used. If you put a bipolar transistor before an opamp, you get lower noise but the 
loop gain of the opamp means the distortion is as good as the opamp alone. This is extremely 

xxiv Preface
useful for making microphone amplifiers and virtual-earth summing amplifiers. If you reverse 
the order, with an opamp followed by bipolar transistors, you can drive much heavier loads, 
with the opamp gain once again providing excellent linearity. This latter technology, among 
others, is explained in a brand new chapter on headphone amplifiers. 
 So much has been added that it is difficult to summarise it, but the new material includes: 
 •  An increasing demand for 5 V and 3.3 V single-rail audio with good performance has 
led to a whole new chapter on low-voltage opamps. Likewise there is new information 
on analogue switching with low supply rails. 
 •  The material on moving-magnet and moving-coil amplifiers has been much expanded 
to include non-standard replay equalisation (for 78s, wax cylinders, etc.), more 
on moving-magnet noise, the ultimate limits on moving-coil noise performance, 
specialised filtering, and more. Mind you, the fact that it needs four whole chapters 
to cover the process of extracting a reasonable signal from a record groove indicates 
to me that there is something amiss with the whole concept. 
 •  There is much more on discrete transistor circuitry, especially input stages for moving-
magnet cartridges, and discrete opamps with ultra-low distortion. 
 •  Active volume controls, especially the Baxandall control, are covered in greater 
depth. Loudness controls are currently unfashionable but the thinking behind them 
is intriguing. I include a possible solution to the mystery of why almost everyone 
disliked them, when consensus of any sort is rare in the hifi business. 
 •  Balance controls now have their own chapter: passive, active, and switched types are 
covered, plus the technology for true constant-volume balance systems. 
 •  The tone-control chapter is much expanded, and includes my new split-drive 
configuration which makes it practical to use 1 kΩ pots in a low-impedance design, 
giving much lower noise. There is a new design that gives variable-frequency HF and 
LF control in one stage, and a new type of switched-frequency LF EQ. 
 •  Instrumentation amplifiers have long been praised for giving good common-mode 
rejection, but this has been hard to exploit in audio. I demonstrate how to do it, and 
get improved noise at the same time. 
 •  There is much more on the ingenious but little-known technology of ground-
cancelling outputs, showing how they can give a noise advantage over conventional 
balanced interconnections. Cunning ways of substantially reducing line output 
transformer distortion at near-zero cost are described. 
 •  One of the many new chapters is devoted to headphone amplifiers, including hybrid 
types and a discrete Class-A design with ultra-low distortion. 

Preface xxv
 •  In the field of mixing console design, there is more on routing systems, balanced 
virtual-earth summing amplifiers, and level indication, including the Log Law Level 
LED or LLLL, which gives much more level information from a single LED than just 
on/off. 
 •  The chapter on interfacing with the digital domain now includes the use of 
housekeeping microcontrollers for muting, input selection, IR decoding, and so on. 
 However, what you most emphatically will  not find here is any truck with the religious 
dogma of audio subjectivism – the directional cables, the oxygen-free copper, the World War 
One vintage triodes still spattered with the mud of the Somme, and all the other depressing 
paraphernalia of pseudo- and anti-science. I have spent more time than I care to contemplate 
in double-blind listening tests – properly conducted ones, with rigorous statistical analysis – 
and every time the answer was that if you couldn’t measure it you couldn’t hear it. Very often 
if you could measure it you still couldn’t hear it. However, faith-based audio is not going 
away any time soon because few people (apart, of course, from the unfortunate customers) 
have any interest in it so doing; you can bet your bottom diode on that. If you want to know 
more about my experiences and reasoning in this area, there is a full discussion in my book 
 Audio Power Amplifier Design. 
 A good deal of thought and experiment has gone into this book, and I dare to hope that I 
have moved analogue audio design a bit further forward. I hope you find it useful. I hope 
you enjoy it too.

 Basics 
 Signals 
 An audio signal can be transmitted either as a voltage or a current. The construction of 
the universe is such that almost always the voltage mode is more convenient; consider for 
a moment an output driving more than one input. Connecting a series of high-impedance 
inputs to a low-impedance output is simply a matter of connecting them in parallel, and if 
the ratio of the output and input impedances is high there will be negligible variations in 
level. To drive multiple inputs with a current output it is necessary to have a series of floating 
current-sensor circuits that can be connected in series. This can be done [1], as pretty much 
anything in electronics can be done, but it requires a lot of hardware, and probably introduces 
performance compromises. The voltage-mode connection is just a matter of wiring. 
 Obviously, if there’s a current, there’s a voltage, and vice versa. You can’t have one without the 
other. The distinction is in the output impedance of the transmitting end (low for voltage-mode, 
high for current-mode) and in what the receiving end responds to. Typically, but not necessarily, 
a voltage input has a high impedance; if its input impedance was only 600 Ω, as used to be the 
case in very old audio distribution systems, it is still responding to voltage, with the current it 
draws doing so a side issue, so it is still a voltage amplifier. In the same way, a current input 
typically, but not necessarily, has a very low input impedance. Current outputs can also present 
problems when they are not connected to anything. With no terminating impedance, the 
voltage at the output will be very high, and probably clipping heavily; the distortion is likely to 
crosstalk into adjacent circuitry. An open-circuit voltage output has no analogous problem. 
 Current-mode connections are not common. One example is the Krell Current Audio Signal 
Transmission (CAST) technology which uses current-mode to interconnect units in the Krell 
product range. While it is not exactly audio, the 4–20 mA current loop format is widely used 
in instrumentation. The current-mode operation means that voltage drops over long cable runs 
are ignored, and the zero offset of the current (i.e. 4 mA  zero) makes cable failure easy to 
detect – if the current is zero, you have a broken cable. 
 The old DIN interconnection standard was a form of current-mode connection in that it had 
voltage output via a high output impedance, of 100 kΩ or more. The idea was presumably that 
you could scale the output to a convenient voltage by selecting a suitable input impedance.

 Voltage ampliﬁ ers 
 These are the vast majority of amplifiers. They take a voltage input at a high impedance and 
yield a voltage output at a low impedance. All conventional opamps are voltage amplifiers 
in themselves, but they can be made to perform as any of four kinds of amplifier by suitable 
feedback connections.   Figure 1.1 a shows a high-gain voltage amplifier with series voltage 
feedback. The closed-loop gain is (R1  R2)/R2. 
 Transconductance ampliﬁ ers 
 The name simply means that a voltage input (usually differential) is converted to a current 
output. It has a transfer ratio A  I out /V in , which has dimensions of I/V or conductance, 
so it is referred to as a transconductance amplifier. It is possible to make a very simple, 
though not very linear, voltage-controlled amplifier with transconductance technology – 
differential-input operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) ICs have an extra pin that 
gives voltage-control of the transconductance, which when used with no negative feedback 
gives gain control (see  Chapter 19 for details). Performance falls well short of that required 
for quality hifi or professional audio.  Figure 1.1 b shows an OTA used without feedback – 
note the current-source symbol at the output. 
The drawback was that the high output impedance made the amount of power transferred very 
small, leading to a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The concept is now wholly obsolete. 
 Ampliﬁ ers 
 At the most basic level, there are four kinds of amplifier, because there are two kinds of 
signal (voltage and current) and two types of port (input and output). The handy word 
‘port’ glosses over whether the input or output is differential or single ended. Amplifiers 
with differential input are very common – such as all opamps and most power amps – but 
differential outputs are rare and normally confined to specialised telecoms chips. 
 To summarise the four kinds of amplifier:

 Current ampliﬁ ers 
 These accept a current in, and give a current out. Since, as we have already noted, current-
mode operation is rare, there is not often a use for a true current amplifier in the audio 
business. They should not be confused with current feedback amplifiers (CFAs) which 
have a voltage output, the ‘current’ bit referring to the way the feedback is applied in 
current-mode [2]. The bipolar transistor is sometimes described as a current amplifier, but it 
is nothing of the kind. Current may flow in the base circuit but this is just an unwanted side-
effect. It is the  voltage on the base that actually controls the transistor. 
 Transimpedance ampliﬁ ers 
 A transimpedance amplifier accepts a current in (usually single-ended) and gives a voltage 
out. It is sometimes called an I–V converter. It has a transfer ratio A  V out /I in , which 
has dimensions of V/I or resistance. That is why it is referred to as a transimpedance or 
transresistance amplifier. Transimpedance amplifiers are usually made by applying shunt 
voltage feedback to a high-gain voltage amplifier. An important use is as virtual-earth 
summing amplifiers in mixing consoles (see  Chapter 17 ). The voltage amplifier stage (VAS) 
in most power amplifiers is a transimpedance amplifier. They are used for I–V conversion 
when interfacing to DACs with current outputs (see  Chapter 21 ). Transimpedance amplifiers 
are sometimes incorrectly described as ‘current amplifiers’. 
 Figure 1.1 c shows a high-gain voltage amplifier transformed into a transimpedance amplifier 
by adding the shunt voltage feedback resistor R1. The transimpedance gain is simply the 
value of R1, though it is normally expressed in V/μA rather than Ohms. 
 Negative feedback 
 Negative feedback is one of the most useful and omnipresent concepts in electronics. It can 
be used to control gain, to reduce distortion and improve frequency response, and to set input 
and output impedances, and one feedback connection can do all these things at the same time. 
 Figure 1.1 : a) A voltage ampliﬁ er, b) a transconductance ampliﬁ er, c) a transimpedance ampliﬁ er  

4 Chapter 1
Negative feedback comes in four basic modes, as in the four basic kinds of amplifier. It can 
be taken from the output in two different ways (voltage or current feedback) and applied to 
the amplifier input in two different ways (series or shunt). Hence there are four combinations. 
 However, unless you’re making something exotic like an audio constant-current source, the 
feedback is always taken as a voltage from the output, leaving us with just two feedback 
types, series and shunt, both of which are extensively used in audio. When series feedback is 
applied to a high-gain voltage amplifier, as in  Figure 1.1 a, the following statements are true: 
 •  Negative feedback reduces voltage gain. 
 •  Negative feedback increases gain stability. 
 •  Negative feedback increases bandwidth. 
 •  Negative feedback increases amplifier input impedance. 
 •  Negative feedback reduces amplifier output impedance. 
 •  Negative feedback reduces distortion. 
 •  Negative feedback does not directly alter the signal-to-noise ratio. 
 If shunt feedback is applied to a voltage amplifier to make a transimpedance amplifier, as 
in  Figure 1.1 c, all the above statements are still true, except since we have applied shunt 
rather series negative feedback, the input impedance is reduced. 
 The basic feedback relationship in Equation 1.1 is dealt with at length in any number of 
textbooks, but it is of such fundamental importance that I feel obliged to include it here. The 
open-loop gain of the amplifier is A, and β is the feedback fraction, such that if in   Figure 1.1 a 
R1 is 2 kΩ and R2 is 1 kΩ, β is 13 . If A is very high, you don’t even need to know it – the 1 
on the bottom becomes negligible, and the As on top and bottom cancel out, leaving us with a 
gain of almost exactly three.

(Equation 1.1) 
 Negative feedback can however do much more than stabilising gain. Anything unwanted 
occurring in the amplifier, be it distortion, DC drift or almost any of the other ills that 
electronics is heir to, is also reduced by the negative feedback factor (NFB factor for short). 
This is equal to:

 What negative feedback cannot do is improve the noise performance. When we apply 
feedback, the gain drops and the noise drops by the same factor, leaving the signal-to-noise 

Basics 5
ratio the same. Negative feedback and the way it reduces distortion is explained in much 
more detail in one of my other books [3]. 
 Nominal signal levels and dynamic range 
 The absolute level of noise in a circuit is not of great significance in itself; what counts is 
how much greater the signal is than the noise – in other words, the signal to noise ratio. An 
important step in any design is the determination of the optimal signal level at each point 
in the circuit. Obviously a real signal, as opposed to a test sinewave, continuously varies in 
amplitude, and the signal level chosen is purely a nominal level. One must steer a course 
between two evils: 
 •  If the signal level is too low, it will be contaminated unduly by noise. 
 •  If the signal level is too high there is a risk it will clip and introduce severe distortion. 
 The wider the gap between them the greater the dynamic range. You will note that the first 
evil is a certainty, while the second is more of a statistical risk. The consequences of both 
must be considered when choosing a level, and, if the best possible signal-to-noise is required 
in a studio recording, then the internal level must be high, and if there is an unexpected 
overload you can always do another take. In live situations it will often be preferable to 
sacrifice some noise performance to give less risk of clipping. The internal signal levels of 
mixing consoles are examined in detail in  Chapter 12 . 
 If you seek to increase the dynamic range, you can either increase the maximum signal level 
or lower the noise floor. The maximum signal levels in opamp-based equipment are set by 
the voltage capabilities of the opamps used, and this usually means a maximum signal level 
of about 10 Vrms or 22 dBu. Discrete transistor technology removes the absolute limit 
on supply voltage and allows the voltage swing to be at least doubled before the supply rail 
voltages get inconveniently high. For example, ±40 V rails are quite practical for small-signal 
transistors and permit a theoretical voltage swing of 28 Vrms or 31 dBu. However, in view 
of the complications of designing your own discrete circuitry, and the greater space and 
power it requires, those nine extra dB of headroom are dearly bought. You must also consider 
the maximum signal capabilities of stages downstream – they might get damaged. 
 The dynamic range of human hearing is normally taken as 100 dB, ranging from the 
threshold of hearing at 0 dB SPL to the usual ‘jack hammer at 1 m’ at 100 dB SPL; 
however hearing damage is generally reckoned to begin with long exposures to levels above 
80 dB SPL. There is, in a sense, a physical maximum to the loudest possible sound. Since 
sound is composed of cycles of compression and rarefaction, this limit is reached when 
the rarefaction creates a vacuum, because you can’t have a lower pressure than that. This 
corresponds to about 194 dB SPL. I thought that this would probably be instantly fatal for 

6 Chapter 1
a human being, but a little research shows that stun grenades generate 170 to 180 dB, so 
maybe not. It is certainly possible to get asymmetrical pressure spikes higher than 194 dB 
but it is not clear that this can be defined as sound. 
 Compare this with the dynamic range of a simple piece of cable. Let’s say it has a resistance 
of 0.5 Ω; the Johnson noise from that will be 155 dBu. If we comply with the European 
Low Voltage Directive, the maximum voltage will be 50 V peak  35 Vrms  33 dBu, so 
the dynamic range is 155  33  188 dBu, which, purely by coincidence, is close to the 
maximum sound level of 194 dB SPL. 
 Gain structures 
 There are some very basic rules for putting together an effective gain structure in a piece of 
equipment. Like many rules, they are subject to modification or compromise when you get into 
a tight corner. Breaking them reduces the dynamic range of the circuitry, either by worsening 
the noise or restricting the headroom; whether this is significant depends on the overall structure 
of the system and what level of performance you are aiming at. Three simple rules are: 
1.  Don’t amplify then attenuate. 
2.  Don’t attenuate then amplify. 
3.  The signal should be raised to the nominal internal level as soon as possible to minimise 
contamination with circuit noise. 
 There are exceptions. For an example, see  Chapter 12 on moving-coil disc inputs, 
where attenuation after amplification does not compromise headroom because of a more 
severe headroom limit downstream. 
 Ampliﬁ cation then attenuation 
 Put baldly it sounds too silly to contemplate, but it is easy to thoughtlessly add a bit of gain 
to make up for a loss somewhere else, and immediately a few dB of precious and irretrievable 
headroom are gone for good. This assumes that each stage has the same power rails and 
hence the same clipping point, which is usually the case in opamp circuitry. 
 Fig 1.2a shows a system with a gain control designed to keep 10 dB of gain in hand. In other 
words, the expectation is that the control will spend most of its working life set somewhere 
around its ‘0 dB’ position where it introduces 10 dB of attenuation, as is typically the case for 
a fader on a mixer. To maintain the nominal signal level at 0 dBu we need 10 dB of gain, and 
a 10 dB amplifier (Stage 2) has been inserted just before the gain control. This is not a good 
decision. This amplifier will clip 10 dB before any other stage in the system, and introduces 
what one might call a headroom bottleneck. 

Basics 7
 There are exceptions. The moving-coil phono head-amp described in  Chapter 8 appears to 
flagrantly break this rule, as it always works at maximum gain even when this is not required. 
But when considered in conjunction with the following RIAA stage, which also has 
considerable gain, it makes perfect sense, for the stage gains are configured so that the second 
stage always clips first, and there is actually no loss of headroom. 
 Attenuation then ampliﬁ cation 
 In  Figure 1.2 b the amplifier is now after the gain control, and noise performance rather than 
headroom suffers. If the signal is attenuated, any active device will inescapably add noise 
in restoring the level. Any conventional gain-control block has to address this issue. If we 
once more require a gain variable from 10 dB to off, i.e. ∞ dB, as would be typical for 
a fader or volume control, then usually the potentiometer is placed before the gain stage as 
in  Figure 1.2 b because, as a rule, some loss in noise performance is more acceptable than a 
permanent 10 dB reduction in system headroom. If there are options for the amplifier stages in 
terms of a noise/cost trade-off (such as using the 5532 versus a TL072) and you can only afford 
one low-noise stage then it should be Stage 2. If all stages have the same noise performance 
this configuration is 10 dB noisier than the previous version when gain is set to 0 dB. 
 Raising the input signal to the nominal level 
 Getting the incoming signal up to the nominal internal level in one jump is always preferable 
as it gives the best noise performance. Sometimes it has to be done in two amplifier stages; 
typical examples are microphone preamps with wide gain ranges and phono preamps that insist 
on performing the RIAA equalisation in several goes (these are explored in their respective 
chapters). In these cases the noise contribution of the second stage may no longer be negligible. 
 Consider a signal path which has an input of 10 dBu and a nominal level of 0 dBu. The first 
version has an input amplifier with 10 dB of gain followed by two unity-gain circuit blocks 
A and B. All circuit blocks are assumed to introduce noise at 100 dBu. The noise output 
for the first version is 89.2 dBu. Now take a second version of the signal path that has an 
 Figure 1.2 : a) Ampliﬁ cation then attenuation. Stage 2 will always clip ﬁ rst, reducing headroom, 
b) attenuation then ampliﬁ cation. The noise from Stage 2 degrades the S/N ratio. The lower the 
gain setting, the worse the effect  

8 Chapter 1
input amplifier with 5 dB of gain, followed by block A, another amplifier with 5 dB of gain, 
then block B. The noise output is now 87.5 dB, 1.7 dB worse, due to the extra amplification 
of the noise from block A. There is also more hardware, and the second version is clearly an 
inferior design. 
 Active gain controls 
 The previous section should not be taken to imply that noise performance must always be 
sacrificed when a gain control is included in the signal path. This is not so. If we move 
beyond the idea of a fixed-gain block, and recognise that the amount of gain present can be 
varied, then less gain when the maximum is not required will reduce the noise generated. For 
volume-control purposes it is essential that the gain can be reduced to near-zero, though it is 
not necessary for it to be as firmly ‘off’ as the faders or sends of a mixer. 
 An active volume-control stage gives lower noise at lower volume settings because there 
is less gain. The Baxandall active configuration also gives excellent channel balance as it 
depends solely on the mechanical alignment of a dual linear pot – all mismatches of its 
electrical characteristics are cancelled out, and there are no quasi-log dual slopes to induce 
anxiety. Active gain controls are looked at in depth in  Chapter 9 . 
 Noise 
 Noise here refers only to the random noise generated by resistances and active devices. The 
term is sometimes used to include mains hum, spurious signals from demodulated RF and 
other non-random sources, but this threatens confusion and I prefer to call the other unwanted 
signals ‘interference’. In the one case we are striving to minimise the random variations 
arising in the circuit itself, in the other we are trying to keep extraneous signals out, and the 
techniques are wholly different. 
 When noise is referred to in electronics it means white noise unless it is specifically labelled 
as something else, because that is the form of noise that most electronic processes generate. 
There are two elemental noise mechanisms which make themselves felt in all circuits and 
active devices. These are Johnson noise and Shot noise, which are both forms of white noise. 
Both have Gaussian probability density functions. These two basic mechanisms generate the 
noise in both BJTs and FETs, though in rather different ways. 
 There are other forms of noise that originate from less fundamental mechanisms such as 
device processing imperfections which do not have a white spectrum: examples are 1/ f 
(flicker) noise and popcorn noise. These noise mechanisms are described later in this chapter. 
 Non-white noise is given a colour which corresponds to the visible spectrum – thus red noise 
has a larger low-frequency content than white noise, while pink is midway between the two. 

Basics 9
 White noise has equal power in equal absolute bandwidth, i.e. with the bandwidth measured 
in Hz. Thus there is the same power between 100 and 200Hz as there is between 1100 and 
1200Hz. It is the type produced by most electronic noise mechanisms [4]. 
 Pink noise has equal power in equal ratios of bandwidth, so there is the same power between 
100 and 200Hz as there is between 200 and 400Hz. The energy per Hz falls at 3 dB per 
octave as frequency increases. Pink noise is widely used for acoustic applications like room 
equalisation and loudspeaker measurement as it gives a flat response when viewed on a third-
octave or other constant-percentage-bandwidth spectrum analyzer [5]. 
 Red noise  has energy per Hz falling at 6 dB per octave rather than 3. It is important in the 
study of stochastic processes and climate models, but has little application in audio. The 
only place you are likely to encounter it is in the oscillator section of analogue synthesisers. 
It is sometimes called Brownian noise as it can be produced by Brownian motion, hence its 
alternative name of random-walk noise. Brown here is a person and not a colour [6]. 
 Blue noise has energy per Hz rising at 3 dB per octave. Blue noise is used for dithering 
in image anti-aliasing, but has, as far as I am aware, no application to audio. The spectral 
density of blue noise (i.e. the power per Hz) is proportional to the frequency. It appears that 
the light-sensitive cells in the retina of the mammalian eye are arranged in a pattern that 
resembles blue noise [7]. Great stuff, this evolution. 
 Violet noise has energy per Hz rising at 6 dB per octave (I imagine you saw that one 
coming). It is also known as ‘differentiated white noise’ as a differentiator circuit has a 
frequency response rising at 6 dB per octave. It is sometimes called purple noise. It has no 
known audio use.
 Grey noise is pink noise modified by a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve, such as 
the inverse of the A-weighting curve, to give the perception of equal loudness at all 
frequencies. 
 Green noise really does exist, though not in the audio domain. It is used for stochastic 
half-toning of images, and consists of binary dither patterns composed of homogeneously 
distributed minority pixel clusters. I think we had better leave it there. 
 Johnson noise 
 Johnson noise is produced by all resistances, including those real resistances hiding inside 
transistors (such as r bb , the base spreading resistance). It is not generated by the so-called 
intrinsic resistances, such as r e , which is an expression of the V be /I c slope and not a physical 
resistance at all. Given that Johnson noise is present in every circuit, and often puts a limit 
on noise performance, it is a bit surprising that it was not discovered until 1928 by John B. 
Johnson at Bell Labs [8]. 

10 Chapter 1
 The rms amplitude of Johnson noise is easily calculated with the classic formula: 
 
kTRB
4
nv   
 
(Equation 1.3) 
 where v n is the rms noise voltage, T is absolute temperature in °K, B is the bandwidth in Hz, 
k is Boltzmann’s constant and R is the resistance in Ohms. 
 The only thing to be careful with here (apart from the usual problem of keeping the powers 
of ten straight) is to make sure you use Boltzmann’s constant (1.380662  10 23 ), and  not 
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67  10 08 ) which relates to black-body radiation, and will 
give some spectacularly wrong answers. Often the voltage noise is left in its squared form for 
ease of summing with other noise sources.  Table 1.2 gives a feel for how resistance affects 
the magnitude of Johnson noise. The temperature is 25 °C and the bandwidth is 22 kHz. 
 Johnson noise theoretically goes all the way to daylight, but in the real world is ultimately 
band-limited by the shunt capacitance of the resistor. Johnson noise is not produced by 
circuit reactances – i.e. pure capacitance and inductance. In the real world, however, reactive 
components are not pure, and the winding resistances of transformers can produce significant

Basics 11
Johnson noise; this is an important factor in the design of moving-coil cartridge step-up 
transformers. Capacitors with their very high leakage resistances approach perfection much 
more closely, and the capacitance has a filtering effect. They usually have no detectable 
effect on noise performance, and in some circuitry it is possible to reduce noise by using a 
capacitive potential divider instead of a resistive one [9]. 
 The noise voltage is of course inseparable from the resistance, so the equivalent circuit is 
of a voltage source in series with the resistance present. While Johnson noise is usually 
represented as a voltage, it can also be treated as a Johnson noise current, by means of the 
Thevenin-Norton transformation, which gives the alternative equivalent circuit of a current-
source in shunt with the resistance. The equation for the noise current is simply the Johnson 
voltage divided by the value of the resistor it comes from: 
 i n   v n  R 
 When it is first encountered, this ability of resistors to generate electricity from out of 
nowhere seems deeply mysterious. You wouldn’t be the first person to think of connecting 
a small electric motor across the resistance and getting some useful work out – and you 
wouldn’t be the first person to discover it doesn’t work. If it did, then by the First Law of 
Thermodynamics (the law of conservation of energy) the resistor would have to get colder, 
and such a process is flatly forbidden by . . . the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The 
Second Law is no more negotiable than the First Law, and it says that energy cannot be extracted 
by simply cooling down one body. If you could, it would be what thermodynamicists call 
a Perpetual Motion Machine of the Second Kind, and they are no more buildable than the 
common sort of perpetual motion machine. 
 It is interesting to speculate what happens as the resistor is made larger. Does the Johnson 
voltage keep increasing until there is a hazardous voltage across the resistor terminals? 
Obviously not, or picking up any piece of plastic would be a lethal experience. Johnson noise 
comes from a source impedance equal to the resistor generating it, and this alone would 
prevent any problems.  Table 1.2 ends with a couple of silly values to see just how this works: 
the square root in the equation means that you need a peta-ohm resistor (1  10 15 Ω) to reach 
even 600 mVrms of Johnson noise. Resistors are made up to at least 100 GΩ but peta-ohm 
resistors (PΩ?) would really be a minority interest. 
 Shot noise 
 It is easy to forget that an electric current is not some sort of magic fluid, but is actually 
composed of a finite, though usually very large, number of electrons, so current is in effect 
quantized. Shot noise is so called because it allegedly sounds like a shower of lead shot being 
poured onto a drum, and the name emphasises the discrete nature of the charge-carriers. 

12 Chapter 1
Despite the picturesque description, the spectrum is still that of white noise, and the noise 
current amplitude for a given steady current is described by a surprisingly simple equation (as 
Einstein said, the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible) 
that runs thus: 
 
Noise current 
ZqIdcB
in
 
 (Equation 1.4) 
 where q is the charge on an electron (1.602  10 19 Coulomb), I dc is the mean value of the 
current and B is the bandwidth examined. 
 As with Johnson noise, often the shot noise is left in its squared form for ease of summing 
with other noise sources.  Table 1.3 helps to give a feel for the reality of shot noise. As the 
current increases, the shot noise increases too, but more slowly as it depends on the square 
root of the DC current; therefore the  percentage fluctuation in the current becomes less. It is 
the small currents which are the noisiest. 
 The actual level of shot noise voltage generated if the current noise is assumed to flow 
through a 100 Ohm resistor is rather low, as the last column shows. There are few systems 
which will be embarrassed by an extra noise source of even 99 dBu unless it occurs right at 
the very input. To generate this level of shot noise requires 1 Amp to flow through 100 Ohms, 
which naturally means a voltage-drop of 100 V and a 100 Watts of power dissipated. These 
are not often the sort of circuit conditions that exist in preamplifier circuitry. This does not 
mean that shot noise can be ignored completely, but it can usually be ignored unless it is 
happening in an active device where the noise is amplified. 
 1/ f noise (ﬂ icker noise) 
 This is so-called because it rises in amplitude proportionally as the frequency examined 
falls. Unlike Johnson noise and shot noise, it is not a fundamental consequence of the 
way the universe is put together, but the result of imperfections in device construction.

Basics 13
1/ f noise appears in all kinds of active semiconductors, and also in some resistors. As 
frequency falls, the 1/ f noise amplitude stays level down to the 1/ f corner frequency, 
after which it rises at 6 dB/octave. For a discussion of flicker noise in resistors see 
 Chapter 2 . 
 Popcorn noise 
 This form of noise is named after the sound of popcorn being cooked, rather than eaten. It 
is also called burst noise or bistable noise, and is a type of low frequency noise that appears 
primarily in integrated circuits, appearing as low level step changes in the output voltage, 
occurring at random intervals. Viewed on an oscilloscope, this type of noise shows bursts 
of changes between two or more discrete levels. The amplitude stays level up to a corner 
frequency, at which point it falls at a rate of 1/ f  2 . Different burst-noise mechanisms within 
the same device can exhibit different corner frequencies. The exact mechanism is poorly 
understood, but is known to be related to the presence of heavy-metal ion contamination, 
such as gold. As for 1/ f noise, the only measure that can be taken against it is to choose 
an appropriate device. Like 1/ f noise, popcorn noise does not have a Gaussian amplitude 
distribution. 
 Summing noise sources 
 When random noise from different sources is summed, the components do not add in 
a 2  2  4 manner. Since the noise components come from different sources, with 
different versions of the same physical processes going on, they are uncorrelated and 
will partially reinforce and partially cancel, so root-mean-square (rms) addition holds, as 
shown in Equation 1.5. If there are two noise sources with the same level, the increase 
is 3 dB rather than 6 dB. When we are dealing with two sources in one device, such 
as a bipolar transistor, the assumption of no correlation is slightly dubious, because 
some correlation is known to exist, but it does not seem to be enough to cause serious 
calculation errors.

  . . .) 
(Equation 1.5) 
 Any number of noise sources may be summed in the same way, by simply adding more 
squared terms inside the square root, as shown by the dots. When dealing with noise in the 
design process, it is important to keep in mind the way that noise sources add together 
when they are not of equal amplitude.  Table 1.4 on the following page shows how this works 
in decibels. Two equal voltage noise sources give a sum of 3 dB, as expected. What is 
notable is that when the two sources are of rather unequal amplitude, the smaller one makes 
very little contribution to the result. 

14 Chapter 1
 If we have a circuit in which one noise source is twice the rms amplitude of the other 
(a 6 dB difference), then the quieter source only increases the rms-sum by 0.97 dB, a change 
barely detectable on critical listening. If one source is 10 dB below the other, the increase 
is only 0.4 dB, which in most cases could be ignored. At 20 dB down, the increase is lost in 
measurement error. This mathematical property of uncorrelated noise sources is exceedingly 
convenient, because it means that in practical calculations we can neglect all except the most 
important noise sources with minimal error. Since all semiconductors have some variability 
in their noise performance, it is rarely worthwhile to make the calculations to great accuracy. 
 Noise in ampliﬁ ers 
 There are basic principles of noise design that apply to all amplifiers, be they discrete 
or integrated, single-ended or differential. Practical circuits, even those consisting of an 
opamp and two resistors, have multiple sources of noise. Typically one source of noise will 
dominate, but this cannot be taken for granted and it is essential to evaluate all the sources 
and the ways that they add together if a noise calculation is going to be reliable. Here I add 
the complications one stage at a time. 
 Figure 1.3 shows that most useful of circuit elements, the perfect noiseless amplifier (these 
seem to be unaccountably hard to find in catalogues). It is assumed to have a definite gain 
A without bothering about whether it is achieved by feedback or not, and an infinite input 
impedance. To emulate a real amplifier, noise sources are concentrated at the input, combined 
into one voltage noise source and one current noise source. These can represent any number 
of actual noise sources inside the real amplifier.  Figure 1.3 shows two ways of drawing the 
same situation.

Basics 15
 It does not matter on which side of the voltage source the current source is placed; the 
‘perfect’ amplifier has an infinite input impedance, and the voltage source a zero impedance, 
so either way all of the current noise flows through whatever is attached to the input. 
 Figure 1.4 shows the first step to a realistic situation, with a signal source now connected to 
the amplifier input. The signal source is modelled as a perfect zero-impedance voltage source 
with added series resistance R s . Many signal sources are modelled accurately enough for 
noise calculations in this way. Examples are low impedance dynamic microphones, moving-
coil phono cartridges, and most electronic outputs. In others cases, such as moving-magnet 
phono cartridges and capacitor microphone capsules, there is a big reactive component which 
has a major effect on the noise behaviour and cannot be ignored or treated as a resistor. The 
magnitude of the reactances tends to vary from one make to another, but fortunately the 
variations are not great enough for the circuit approach for optimal noise to vary greatly. It 
is pretty clear that a capacitor microphone will have a very high source impedance at audio 
frequencies, and will need a special high-impedance preamplifier to avoid low frequency 
roll-off (see  Chapter 13 for details). It is perhaps less obvious that the series inductance of a 
moving-magnet phono cartridge becomes the dominating factor at the higher end of the audio 
band, and designing for the lowest noise with the 600 Ω or so series resistance alone will give 
far from optimal results. This is dealt with in  Chapter 7 . 
 There are two sources of voltage noise in the circuit of  Figure 1.4 . 
1.  The amplifier voltage noise source v n at the input. 
2.  The Johnson noise from the source resistance Rs. 
 These two voltage sources are in series and sum by rms-addition as they are uncorrelated. 
 Figure 1.3: The noise sources of a perfect ampliﬁ er. The two circuits are exactly equivalent 
 Figure 1.4: The perfect ampliﬁ er and noise sources with a signal source now connected  

16 Chapter 1
 There is only one current noise component – the amplifier noise current source i n across 
the input. This generates a noise voltage when its noise current flows through Rs (it cannot 
flow into the amplifier input because we are assuming an infinite input impedance). This 
third source of voltage noise is also added in by rms-addition, and the total is amplified by 
the voltage gain A and appears at the output. The noise voltage at the input is the equivalent 
input noise (EIN). This is impossible to measure, so the noise at the amplifier output is 
divided by A to get the EIN. Having got this, we can compare it with the Johnson noise 
from the source resistance Rs; with a noiseless amplifier there would be no difference, but 
in real life the EIN will be higher by a number of dB which is called the noise figure (NF). 
This gives a concise way of assessing how noisy our amplifier is and if it is worth trying to 
improve it. Noise figures very rarely appear in hifi literature, probably because most of them 
wouldn’t look very good. For the application of noise figures to phono cartridge amplifiers, 
see  Chapters 8 and  11 . 
 Noise in bipolar transistors 
 An analysis of the noise behaviour of discrete bipolar transistors can be found in many 
textbooks, so this is something of a quick summary of the vital points. Two important 
transistor parameters for understanding noise are r bb , the base spreading resistance, and r e , 
the intrinsic emitter resistance. r bb is a real physical resistance – what is called an  extrinsic 
resistance. The second parameter, r e , is an expression of the V be /I c slope and not a physical 
resistance at all, so it is called an  intrinsic resistance. 
 Noise in bipolar transistors, as in amplifiers in general, is best dealt with by assuming 
a noiseless transistor with a theoretical noise voltage source in series with the base 
and a theoretical noise current source connected from base to emitter. These sources 
are usually described simply as the ‘voltage noise’ and the ‘current noise’ of the 
transistor. 
 Bipolar transistor voltage noise 
 The voltage noise v n is made up of two components: 
1.  The Johnson noise generated in the base spreading resistance r bb .
2.  The collector current ( I c) shot noise creating a noise voltage across r e , the intrinsic emitter 
resistance. 
 These two components can be calculated from the equations given earlier, and rms-summed 
thus: 
Voltage noise density vn  √ 4kTrbb  2(kT)2/(qIc) in V√ Hz (usually nV√ Hz) (Equation 1.6)

Basics 17
 where k is Boltzmann’s constant (1.380662  10 23 ), q is the charge on an electron 
(1.602  10 19 Coulomb), T is absolute temperature in °K, I c is the collector current and r bb 
is the base resistance in Ohms. 
 The first part of this equation is the usual expression for Johnson noise, and is fixed for a 
given transistor type by the physical value of r bb , so the lower this is the better. The only 
way you can reduce this is by changing to another transistor type with a lower R bb or using 
paralleled transistors. The absolute temperature is a factor; running your transistor at 25 °C 
rather than 125 °C reduces the Johnson noise from r bb  by 1.2 dB. Input devices usually run 
cool but this may not be the case with moving-coil preamplifiers where a large I c is required, 
so it is not impossible that adding a heatsink would give a measurable improvement in noise. 
 The second (shot noise) part of the equation decreases as collector current I c increases; this 
is because as I c increases, r e decreases proportionally, following r e  25/I c where I c is in mA. 
The shot noise, however, is only increasing as the square root of Ic, and the overall result is 
that the total v n falls – though relatively slowly – as collector current increases, approaching 
asymptotically the level of noise set by the first part of the equation. There is an extra voltage noise 
source resulting from flicker noise produced by the base current flowing through r bb ; this is only 
significant at high collector currents and low frequencies due to its 1/ f nature, and is not usually 
included in design calculations unless low frequency quietness is a special requirement. 
 Bipolar transistor current noise 
 The current noise i n , is mainly produced by the shot noise of the steady current I b flowing 
through the transistor base. This means it increases as the square root of I b increases. 
Naturally I b increases with  I c . Current noise is given by: 
 
 Current noise density in  √ 2qIb  in A√ Hz (usual values are in pA) 
 (Equation 1.7) 
 where q is the charge on an electron and I b is the base current. 
 So, for a fixed collector current, you get less current noise with high-beta transistors because 
there is less base current. 
 The existence of current noise as well as voltage noise means it is not possible to minimise 
transistor noise just by increasing the collector current to the maximum value the device can 
take. Increasing  I c reduces voltage noise, but it increases current noise, as in  Figure 1.5. There 
is an optimum collector current for each value of source resistance, where the contributions 
are equal. Because both voltage and current noise are proportional to the square root of I c , 
they change slowly as it alters, and the combined noise curve is rather flat at the bottom. 
There is no need to control collector current with great accuracy to obtain optimum noise 
performance. 

18 Chapter 1
 I must emphasise that this is a simplified noise model. In practice both voltage and current 
noise densities vary with frequency. I have also ignored 1/ f noise. However, it gives the 
essential insight into what is happening and leads to the right design decisions so we will put 
our heads down and press on. 
 A quick example shows how this works. In a voltage amplifier we want the source 
impedances seen by the input transistors to be as low as possible, to minimise Johnson 
noise, and to minimise the effects of current noise. If we are lucky it may be as low as 
100 Ω. How do we minimise the noise from a single transistor faced with a 100 Ω source 
resistance? 
 We assume the temperature is 25  o C, the bandwidth is 22 kHz, and the r bb of our transistor is 
40 Ω (why don’t they put this on spec sheets anymore?). The h fe (beta) is 150. Set I c to 1 mA, 
which is plausible for an amplifier input stage, step the source resistance from 1 to 100,000 Ω 
in decades, and we get  Table 1.5 . 
 Column 1 shows the source resistance, and Column 2 the Johnson noise density it 
generates by itself. Factor in the bandwidth, and you get Columns 3 and 4 which show 
the voltage in nV and dBu respectively. Column 5 is the noise density from the transistor, 
 Figure 1.5:  How voltage noise density Vn and current noise density In vary with collector current 
Ic in a generic transistor. As Ic increases voltage noise asymptotes to a limit while current noise

the rms-sum of the voltage noise and the voltage generated by the current noise flowing 
in the source resistance. Column 6 gives total noise density when we sum the source 
resistance noise density with the transistor noise density. Factor in the bandwidth again, 
and the resultant noise voltage is given in Columns 7 and 8. Column 9 gives the noise 
figure (NF), which is the amount by which the combination of transistor and source 
resistance is noisier than the source resistance alone. In other words, it tells how close 
we have got to perfection, which would be a noise figure of 0 dB. The results for the 
100 Ω source show that the transistor noise is less than the source resistance Johnson 
noise; there is little scope for improving things by changing transistor type or operating 
conditions. 
 The results for the other source resistances are worth looking at. The lowest noise output 
(134.9 dBu) is achieved by the lowest source resistance of 1 Ω, as you would expect, but 
the NF is very poor at 17.3 dB, because the r bb at 40 Ω is generating a lot more noise than 
the 1 Ω source. This gives you some idea why it is hard to design quiet moving-coil head 
amplifiers. The best noise figure, and the closest approach to theoretical perfection is with 
a 1000 Ω source, attained with a  greater noise output than 100 Ω. As source resistance 
increases further, NF worsens again; a transistor with I c  1 mA has relatively high current 
noise and performs poorly with high source resistances. 
 Since I c is about the only thing we have any control over here, let’s try altering it. If we 
increase I c to 3 mA we find that for a 100 Ω source resistance, our amplifier is only a 
marginal 0.2 dB quieter. See  Table 1.6 , which skips the intermediate calculations and just 
gives the output noise and NF. 
 At 3 mA the noise with a 1 Ω source is 0.7 dB better, due to slightly lower voltage noise, 
but with 100 kΩ noise is higher by no less than 9.8 dB as the current noise is much 
increased.

 If we increase I c to 10 mA, this makes the 100 Ω noise worse again, and we have lost that 
slender 0.2 dB improvement. 
 At 1 Ω the noise is 0.3 dB better, which is not exactly a breakthrough, and for the higher 
source resistances things worsen again, the 100 kΩ noise increasing by another 5.2 dB. It 
therefore appears that a collector current of 3 mA is actually pretty much optimal for noise 
with our 100 Ω source resistance. 
 If we now pluck out our ‘ordinary’ transistor and replace it with a specialised low r bb 
part like the much-lamented 2SB737, with its superbly low  r bb of 2 Ω, the noise output 
at 1 Ω plummets by 10 dB, showing just how important low r bb is for moving-coil head 
amplifiers. The improvement for the 100 Ω source resistance is much less at 1.0 dB. 
 If we go back to the ordinary transistor and reduce I c to 100 μA, we get the last two columns 
in  Table 1.6 . Compared with I c  3 mA, noise with the 1 Ω source worsens by 5.7 dB, 
and with the 100 Ω source by 2.6 dB, but with the 100 kΩ source there is a hefty 12.4 dB 
improvement, due to reduced current noise. Quiet BJT inputs for high source impedances can 
be made by using low collector currents, but JFETs usually give better noise performance 
under these conditions. 
 The transistor will probably be the major source of noise in the circuit, but other sources 
may need to be considered. The transistor may have a collector resistor of high value, 
to optimise the stage gain, and this naturally introduces its own Johnson noise. Most 
discrete transistor amplifiers have multiple stages, to get enough open-loop gain for 
linearisation by negative feedback, and an important consideration in discrete noise design 
is that the gain of the first stage should be high enough to make the noise contribution 
of the second stage negligible. This can complicate matters considerably. Precisely the 
same situation prevails in an opamp, but here someone else has done the worrying about 
second-stage noise for you; if you’re not happy with it all you can do is pick another type 
of opamp.

 Noise in JFETs 
 JFETs operate completely differently to bipolar transistors, and noise arises in different ways. 
The voltage noise in JFETs arises from the Johnson noise produced by the channel resistance, the 
effective value of which is the inverse of the transconductance (g m ) of the JFET at the operating 
point we are looking at. An approximate but widely accepted equation for this noise is: 
 
Noise density

 in V√ Hz (usually nV√ Hz)  
(Equation 1.8) 
 where k is Boltzmann’s constant (1.380662  10 23 ) and T is absolute temperature in °K. 
 FET transconductance goes up proportionally to the square root of drain current  I d . When the 
transconductance is inserted into the equation above, it is again square-rooted, so the voltage 
noise is proportional to the fourth root of drain current, and varies with it very slowly. There 
is thus little point in using high drain currents 
 The only current noise source in a JFET is the shot noise associated with the gate leakage current. 
Because the leakage current is normally extremely low, the current noise is very low, which is why 
JFETs give a good noise performance with high source resistances. However, don’t let the JFET 
get hot, because gate leakage doubles with each 10 °C rise in temperature; this is why JFETs can 
actually show  increased noise if the drain current is increased to the point where they heat up. 
 The g m  of JFETs is rather variable, but at I d  1 mA ranges over about 0.5 to 3 mA/V (or mMho) 
so the voltage noise density varies from 4.7 to 1.9 nV/√ Hz. Comparing this with Column 5 
in  Table 1.5 , we can see that the BJTs are much quieter except at high source impedances, 
where their current noise makes them noisier than JFETs. 
However, if you are prepared to use multiple devices, the lowest possible noise may be given 
by JFETs, because the voltage noise falls faster than the effect of the current noise rising, when 
more devices are added.  A low-noise laboratory amplifier design by Samuel Groner achieves a 
spectacularly low noise density of 0.39 nV/√ Hz by using eight paralleled JFETs [10]. 
 Noise in opamps 
 The noise behaviour of an opamp is very similar to that of a single input amplifier, the difference 
being that there are now two inputs to consider, and usually more associated resistors. 
 An opamp is driven by the voltage difference between its two inputs, and so the voltage noise 
can be treated as one voltage v n  connected between them. See  Figure 1.6 , which shows a 
differential amplifier. 
 Opamp current noise is represented by two separate current generators i n  and i n , one in 
parallel with each input. These are assumed to be equal in amplitude and not correlated with each 

22 Chapter 1
other. It is also assumed that the voltage and current noise sources are likewise uncorrelated, so 
that rms-addition of their noise components is valid. In reality, things are not quite so simple, 
and there is some correlation, and the noise produced can be slightly higher than calculated. In 
practice the difference is small compared with natural variations in noise performance. 
 Calculating the noise is somewhat more complex than for the simple amplifier of Figure 1.4. 
You must: 
1.  Calculate the voltage noise from the voltage noise density. 
2.  Calculate the two extra noise voltages resulting from the noise currents flowing through 
their associated components. 
3.  Calculate the Johnson noise produced by each resistor. 
4.  Allow for the noise gain of the circuit when assessing how much each noise source 
contributes to the output. 
5.  Add the lot together by rms-addition. 
 There is no space to go through a complete calculation, but here is a quick example: 
 Suppose you have an inverting amplifier like that in  Figure 1.9 a below. This is simpler 
because the non-inverting input is grounded, so the effect of i n  disappears, as it has no 
resistance to flow through and cannot give rise to a noise voltage. This shunt-feedback stage 
has a ‘noise gain’ that is greater than the signal gain. The input signal is amplified by 1, but 
the voltage noise source in the opamp is amplified by 2, because the voltage noise generator 
is amplified as if the circuit was a series-feedback gain stage. 
 Figure 1.6: The noise sources in an opamp differential ampliﬁ er circuit  

Basics 23
 Low-noise opamp circuitry 
 The rest of this chapter deals with designing low-noise opamp circuitry, dealing with opamp 
selection and the minimisation of circuit impedances. It also shows how adding more stages 
can actually make the circuitry quieter. This sounds somewhat counter-intuitive, but as you 
will see, it is so. 
 When you are designing for low noise, it is obviously important to select the right opamp, 
the great divide being between bipolar and JFET inputs. This chapter concentrates mainly on 
using the 5532, as it is not only a low-noise opamp with superbly low distortion, but also a 
low-cost opamp, due to its large production quantities. There are opamps with lower noise, 
such as the AD797 and the LT1028, but these are specialised items and the cost penalties are 
high. The LT1028 has a bias-cancellation system that increases noise unless the impedances 
seen at each input are equal, and since audio does not need the resulting DC precision, it is 
not useful. The new LM4562 is a dual opamp with somewhat lower noise than the 5532, but 
at present it also is much more expensive. 
 The AD797 runs its bipolar input transistors at high collector currents (about 1 mA) which 
reduces voltage noise but increases current noise. The AD797 will therefore only give lower 
noise for rather low source resistances; these need to be below 1 kΩ to yield benefit for the 
money spent. There is much more on opamp selection in  Chapters 4 and  14 . 
 Noise measurements 
 There are difficulties in measuring the low noise levels we are dealing with here. The 
Audio Precision System 1 test system has a noise floor of 116.4 dBu when its input 
is terminated with a 47 Ω resistor. When it is terminated in a short circuit, the noise 
reading only drops to 117.0 dBu, demonstrating that almost all the noise is internal 
to the AP and the Johnson noise of the 47 Ω resistor is much lower. The significance of 
47 Ω is that it is the lowest value of output resistor that will guarantee stability when 
driving the capacitance of a reasonable length of screened cable; this value will keep 
cropping up. 
 To delve below this noise floor, we can subtract this figure from the noise we measure (on 
the usual rms basis) and estimate the noise actually coming from the circuit under test. This 
process is not very accurate when circuit noise is much below that of the test system, because 
of the subtraction involved, and any figure below 120 dBu should be regarded with caution. 
Cross-checking against the theoretical calculations and SPICE results is always wise; in this 
case it is essential. 
 We will now look at a number of common circuit scenarios and see how low-noise design can 
be applied to them. 

24 Chapter 1
 How to attenuate quietly 
 Attenuating a signal by 6 dB sounds like the easiest electronic task in the world. Two 
equal-value resistors to make up a potential divider, and  voila ! This knotty problem is 
solved. Or is it? 
 To begin with, let us consider the signal going into our divider. Wherever it comes from, 
the source impedance is not likely to be less than 50 Ω. This is also the lowest output 
impedance setting for most high-quality signal generators (though it’s 40 Ω on my AP 
SYS-2702). The Johnson noise from 50 Ω is 135.2 dBu, which immediately puts a 
limit – albeit a very low one – on the performance we can achieve. The maximum signal 
handling capability of opamps is about 22 dBu, so we know at once our dynamic range 
cannot exceed 135  22  155 dB. This comfortably exceeds the dynamic range of human 
hearing, which is about 130 dB if you are happy to accept ‘instantaneous ear damage’ as 
the upper limit. 
 In the scenario we are examining, there is only one variable – the ohmic value of the two 
equal resistors. This cannot be too low or the divider will load the previous stage excessively, 
increasing distortion and possibly reducing headroom. On the other hand, the higher the 
value, the greater the Johnson noise voltage generated by the divider resistances that will be 
added to the signal, and the greater the susceptibility of the circuit to capacitative crosstalk 
and general interference pickup. The trade-off is examined in  Table 1.7 . 
 What happens when our signal with its 135.2 dBu noise level encounters our 6 dB 
attenuator? If it is made up of two 1 kΩ resistors, the noise level at once jumps up to 
125.2 dBu, as the effective source resistance from two 1 kΩ resistors in parallel is 500 Ω. 
10 dB of signal-to-noise ratio is irretrievably gone already, and we have only deployed two 
passive components. There will no doubt be more active and passive circuitry downstream, 
so things can only get worse.

Basics 25
 However, a potential divider made from two 1 kΩ resistors in series presents an input 
impedance of only 2 kΩ, which is too low for most applications. 10 kΩ is normally 
considered the minimum input impedance for a piece of audio equipment in general use, 
which means we must use two 5 kΩ resistors, and so we get an effective source resistance 
of 2.5 kΩ. This produces Johnson noise at 118.2 dBu, so the signal-to-noise ratio has been 
degraded by another 7 dB simply by making the input impedance reasonably high. 
 In some cases 10 kΩ is not high enough, and a 100 kΩ input impedance is sought. Now the 
two resistors have to be 50 kΩ, and the noise is 10 dB higher again, at 108.2 dBu. That is a 
worrying 27 dB worse than our signal when it arrived. 
 If we insist on an input impedance of 100 kΩ, how can we improve on our noise level of 
108.2 dBu? The answer is by buffering the divider from the outside world. The output noise 
of a 5532 voltage-follower is about 119 dBu with a 50 Ω input termination. If this is used 
to drive our attenuator, the two resistors in it can be as low as the opamp can drive. The 5532 
has a most convenient combination of low noise and good load-driving ability, and the divider 
resistors can be reduced to 500 Ω each, giving a load of 1 kΩ and a generous safety margin 
of drive capability (pushing the 5532 to its specified limit of a 500 Ω load tends to degrade its 
superb linearity by a small but measurable amount). See   Figure 1.7 . 
 The noise from the resistive divider itself has now been lowered to 128.2 dBu, but there is 
of course the extra 119 dBu of noise from the voltage-follower that drives it. This however 
is halved by the divider just as the signal is, so the noise at the output will be the rms sum 
of 125 dBu and n128.2 dBu, which is 123.3 dBu. A 6 dB attenuator is actually the 
worst case, as it has the highest possible source impedance for a given total divider resistance. 
Either more or less attenuation will mean less noise from the divider itself. 
 So, despite adding active circuitry that intrudes its own noise, the final noise level has been 
reduced from 108.2 to 123.3 dBu, an improvement of 15.1 dB. 
 Figure 1.7 : Two 6 dB attenuators with a 100 kΩ input impedance: a) simple attenuator with high 
resistor values, b) buffered attenuator with low resistor values. Despite the extra noise from the 
5532 voltage follower this version is 15 dB quieter  

26 Chapter 1
 How to amplify quietly 
 OK, we need a low-noise amplifier. Let’s assume we have a reasonably low source 
impedance of 300 Ω, and we need a gain of four times (12 dB).  Figure 1.8 a shows 
a very ordinary circuit using half a 5532 with typical values of 3 kΩ and 1 kΩ in the 
feedback network, and the noise output measures as 105.0 dBu. The Johnson noise 
generated by the 300 Ω source resistance is 127.4 dBu, and amplifying that by a gain 
of four gives 115.4 dBu. Compare this with the actual 105.0 dBu we get, and the 
noise figure is 10.4 dB – in other words the noise from the amplifier is three times the 
inescapable noise from the source resistance, making the latter essentially negligible. 
This amplifier stage is clearly somewhat short of noise-free perfection, despite using 
one of the quieter opamps around. 
 We need to make things quieter. The obvious thing to do is to reduce the value of the 
feedback resistances; this will reduce their Johnson noise and also reduce the noise produced 
in them by the opamp current noise generators.  Figure 1.8 b shows the feedback network 
altered to 360 Ω and 120 Ω, adding up to a load of 480 Ω, pushing the limits of the lowest 
resistance the opamp can drive satisfactorily. This assumes of course that the next stage 
presents a relatively light load so that almost all of the driving capability can be use to drive 
the negative-feedback network; keeping tiny signals free from noise can involve throwing 
some serious current about. The noise output is reduced to 106.1 dBu, which is only an 
improvement of 1.1 dB, and only brings the noise figure down to 9.3 dB, leaving us still a 
long way from what is theoretically attainable. However, at least it cost us nothing in extra 
components. 
 If we need to make things quieter yet, what can be done? The feedback resistances 
cannot be reduced further, unless the opamp drive capability is increased in some way. 
An output stage made of discrete transistors could be added, but it would almost certainly 
compromise the low distortion we get from a 5532 alone. For one answer see the next 
section on ultra-low noise design. 
 Figure 1.8 : 4 ampliﬁ er a) with ‘normal’ feedback resistances, b) with low-impedance feedback 
arm resistances. Noise is only reduced by 1.1 dB  

Basics 27
 How to invert quietly 
 Inverting a signal always requires the use of active electronics (OK, you  could use a 
transformer). Assume that an input impedance of 47 kΩ is required, along with a unity-gain 
inversion. A straightforward inverting stage as shown in  Figure 1.9 a will give this input 
impedance and gain only if both resistors are 47 kΩ. These relatively high value resistors 
contribute Johnson noise and exacerbate the effect of opamp current noise. Also the opamp is 
working at a noise gain of two times so the noise output is high at 101.4 dBu. 
 The only way to improve this noise level is to add another active stage. It sounds 
paradoxical – adding more non-silent circuitry to reduce noise – but that’s the way the 
universe works. If a voltage-follower is added to the circuit given in  Figure 1.9 b, then the 
resistors around the inverting opamp can be greatly reduced in value without reducing the 
input impedance, which can now be pretty much as high as we like. The ‘Noise buffered’ 
column in  Table 1.8 shows that if R1 and R2 are reduced to 2.2 kΩ, the total noise output is 
lowered by 8.2 dB, which is very useful improvement. If R1 and R2 are further reduced to 
1 kΩ, which is perfectly practical with a 5532’s drive capability, the total noise is reduced by 
9.0 dB compared with the 47 kΩ case. The ‘Noise unbuffered’ column gives the noise output

with specified R value but without the buffer, demonstrating that adding the buffer does 
degrade the noise slightly, but the overall result is still far quieter than the unbuffered version 
with 47 kΩ resistors. In each case the circuit input is terminated to ground via 50 Ω.  
 How to balance quietly 
 The design of low and ultra-low noise balanced amplifiers is thoroughly examined in 
 Chapter 14 on line inputs. 
 Ultra low-noise design with multipath ampliﬁ ers 
 Are the above circuit structures the ultimate? Is this as low as noise gets? No. In the search 
for low-noise, a powerful technique is the use of parallel amplifiers with their outputs 
summed. This is especially useful where source impedances are low and therefore generate 
little noise compared with the voltage noise of the electronics. 
 If there are two amplifiers connected, the signal gain increases by 6 dB due to the summation. 
The noise from the two amplifiers is also summed, but since the two noise sources are 
completely uncorrelated (coming from physically different components) they partially cancel 
and the noise level only increases by 3 dB. Thus there is an improvement in signal-to-noise 
ratio of 3 dB. This strategy can be repeated by using four amplifiers, in which case the signal-
to-noise improvement is 6 dB.  Table 1.9 shows how this works for increasing numbers of 
amplifiers.

 Figure 1.10 : A double voltage-follower or buffer. The noise of this simple circuit is below that of 
the leading test equipment available  
 In practice the increased signal gain is not useful, and an active summing amplifier 
would compromise the noise improvement, so the output signals are averaged rather 
than summed as shown in  Figure 1.10 . The amplifier outputs are simply connected 
together with low-value resistors; so the gain is unchanged but the noise output falls. 
The amplifier outputs are nominally identical, so very little current should flow from one 
opamp to another. The combining resistor values are so low that their Johnson noise can 
be ignored. 
 Obviously there are economic limits on how far you can take this sort of thing. Unless you’re 
measuring gravity waves or something equally important, 256 parallel amplifiers is probably 
not a viable choice. 
 Be aware that this technique does not give any kind of fault redundancy. If one opamp 
turns up its toes, the low value of the averaging resistors means the whole stage will stop 
working. 
 Ultra low-noise voltage buffers 
 The multiple-path philosophy works well even with a minimally simple circuit such as 
a unity-gain voltage buffer.   Table 1.10   gives calculated results for 5532 sections (the 
noise output is too low to measure reliably even with the best test gear) and shows how 
the noise output falls as more opamps are added. The distortion performance is not 
affected. 
 The 10 Ω output resistors combine the opamp outputs, and limit the currents that would 
flow from output to output as a result of DC offset errors. AC gain errors here will be very 

30 Chapter 1
small indeed as the opamps have 100% feedback. If the output resistors were raised to 47 Ω 
they would as usual give HF stability when driving screened cables or other capacitances, 
but the total output impedance is usefully halved to 23.5 Ω. Another interesting bonus of 
this technique is that we have doubled the output drive capability; this stage can easily drive 
300 Ω. This can be very useful when using low-impedance design to reduce noise in the 
following stage. 
 Ultra low-noise ampliﬁ ers 
 We now return to the problem studied earlier; how to make a really quiet amplifier with 
a gain of four times. We saw that the minimum noise output using a single 5532 section 
and a 300 Ω source resistance was 106.1 dBu, with a not particularly impressive 
noise figure of 9.3 dB. Since almost all the noise is being generated in the amplifier 
rather than the source resistance, the multiple-path technique should work well here. 
And it does. 
 There is however, a potential snag that needs to be considered. In the previous section, we 
were combining the outputs of voltage followers, which have gains very close indeed to unity 
because they have 100% negative feedback and no resistors are involved in setting the gain. 
We could be confident that the output signals would be near identical and unwanted currents 
flowing from one opamp to the other would be small despite the low value of the combining 
resistors. 
 The situation here is different: the amplifiers have a gain of four times, so there is a 
smaller negative feedback factor to stabilise the gain, and there are two resistors with 
tolerances that set the closed-loop gain for each stage. We need to keep the combining 
resistors low to minimise their Johnson noise, so things might get awkward. It seems 
reasonable to assume that the feedback resistors will be 1% components. Considering 
the two-amplifier configuration in  Figure 1.11 , the worst case would be to have R1A 1% 
high and R2A 1% low in one amplifier, while the other had the opposite condition of R1B 
1% low and R2B 1% high. This highly unlikely state of affairs gives a gain of 4.06 times

in the first amplifier and 3.94 times in the second. Making the further assumption of a 
10 Vrms maximum voltage swing, we get 10.15 Vrms at the first output and 9.85 Vrms 
at the second, both applied to the combining resistors, which here are set at 47 Ω. The 
maximum possible current flowing from one amplifier output into the other is therefore 
0.3 V/(47 Ω  47 Ω) which is 3.2 mA; in practice it will be much smaller. There are no 
problems with linearity or headroom, and distortion performance is indistinguishable from 
that of a single opamp. 
 Having reassured ourselves on this point, we can examine the circuit of  Figure 1.11 , with 
two amplifiers combining their outputs. This reduces the noise at the output by 2.2 dB. This 
falls short of the 3 dB improvement we might hope for because of a significant Johnson 
noise contribution from source resistance, and doubling the number of amplifier stages 
again only achieves another 1.3 dB improvement. The improvement is greater with lower 
source resistances; the measured results with 1, 2, 3 and 4 opamps for three different source 
resistances are summarised in  Table 1.11 . 
 The results for 200 Ω and 100 Ω show that the improvement with multiple amplifiers is 
greater for lower source resistances, as these resistances generate less Johnson noise of 
their own.

32 Chapter 1
 Multiple ampliﬁ ers for greater drive capability 
 We have just seen that the use of multiple amplifiers with averaged outputs not only reduces 
noise but increases the drive capability proportionally to the number of amplifiers employed. 
This is highly convenient as heavy loads need to be driven when pushing hard the technique 
of low-impedance design. There is more on this in  Chapter 15 , relating to low-impedance 
Baxandall tone-controls. 
 Using multiple amplifiers gets difficult when the stage has variable feedback to implement 
gain control or tone control. In this case the configuration in  Figure 1.12 doubles the drive 
capability in a fool-proof manner – I have always called it ‘mother’s little helper’. A1 may be 
enmeshed in as complicated a circuit as you like, but unity-gain buffer A2 will robustly carry 
out its humble duty of sharing the load. This is unlikely to give any noise advantage, as most of 
the noise will presumably come from the more complex circuitry around A1. 
 It is assumed that A1 has load-driving capabilities equivalent to those of A2. This approach 
is more parts-efficient than simply putting a multiple-buffer like that in  Figure 1.10 after 
A1; that would make no use of the drive capability of A1. This technique was used to drive 
the input of a Baxandall volume control using 1 kΩ pots in the Elektor 2012 preamplifier 
design [11].

 Conductors 
 It is easy to assume, when wrestling with electronic design, that the active devices will 
cause most of the trouble. This, like so much in electronics, is subject to Gershwin’s Law; ‘it 
ain’t necessarily so’. Passive components cannot be assumed to be perfect, and while their 
shortcomings are rarely discussed, in polite company, they are all too real. In this chapter I 
have tried to avoid repeating basic stuff that can be found in many other places, to allow room 
for information that goes deeper. 
 Normal metallic conductors, such as copper wire, show perfect linearity for our purposes, 
and as far as I am aware, for everybody’s purposes. Ohm’s Law was founded on metallic 
conductors, after all; not resistors, which did not exist as we know them at the time. George 
Simon Ohm published a pamphlet in 1827, entitled ‘The Galvanic Circuit Investigated 
Mathematically’, while he was a professor of mathematics in Cologne. His work was not 
warmly received, except by a perceptive few; the Prussian minister of education pronounced 
that ‘a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science’. This is the sort 
of thing that happens when politicians try to involve themselves in science, and in that respect 
we have progressed little since then. 
 Although the linearity is generally effectively ideal, metallic conductors will not be perfectly 
linear in some circumstances. Poorly-made connections between oxidised or otherwise 
contaminated metal parts are capable of generating harmonic distortion at the level of several 
per cent, but this is a property of the contact interface rather than the bulk material, and 
usually means that the connection is about to fail altogether. A more subtle danger is that 
of magnetic conductors – the soft iron in relay frames causes easily detectable distortion at 
power-amplifier current levels. 
 From time to time some of the dimmer audio commentators speculate that metallic 
conductors are actually a kind of ‘sea of micro-diodes’, and that non-linearity can be found if 
the test signal levels are made small enough. This is both categorically untrue and physically 
impossible. There is no threshold effect for metallic conduction. I have myself added to 
the mountain of evidence on this, by measuring distortion at very low signal levels [1]. 
Renardsen has some more information at [2]. 

36 Chapter 2
 Copper and other conductive elements 
 Copper is the preferred metal for conducting electricity in almost all circumstances. It has 
the lowest resistance of any metal but silver, is reasonably resistant to corrosion, and can 
be made mechanically strong; it’s wonderful stuff. Being a heavy metal, it is unfortunately 
not that common in the earth’s crust, and so is expensive compared with iron and steel. It is 
however cheap compared with silver. The price of metals varies all the time due to changing 
economic and political factors, but at the time of writing silver was 100 times more expensive 
than copper by weight. Given the same cross-section of conductor, the use of silver would 
only reduce the resistance of a circuit by 5%. Despite this, silver connection wire has been 
used in some very expensive hifi amplifiers; output impedance-matching transformers 
wound with silver wire are not unknown in valve amplifiers. Since the technical advantages 
are usually negligible such equipment is marketed on the basis of indefinable subjective 
improvements. The only exception is the moving-coil step-up transformer, where the use of 
silver in the primary winding might give a measurable reduction in Johnson noise.
 Table 2.1 gives the resistivity of the commonly-used conductors, plus some insulators to 
give it perspective. The difference between copper and quartz is of the order of 10 to the 25, 
an enormous range that is not found in many other physical properties. There are several 
reasonably conductive metals that are lighter than copper, but their higher resistivity means 
they require larger cross-sections to carry the same current, so copper is always used when 
space is limited, as in electric motors, solenoids, etc. However, when size is not the primary 
constraint the economics work out differently. The largest use of non-copper conductors is 
probably in the transmission line cables that are strung between pylons. Here minimal weight 
is more important than minimal diameter, so the cables have a central steel core for strength, 
surrounded by aluminium conductors. 
 It is clear that simply spending more money does not automatically bring you a better 
conductor; gold is a somewhat poorer conductor than copper, and platinum, which is even more 
expensive, is worse by a factor of six. Another interesting feature of this table is the relatively 
high resistance of mercury, nearly 60 times that of copper. This often comes as a surprise; 
people seem to assume that a metal of such high density must be very conductive, but it is not 
so. There are many reasons for not using mercury-filled hoses as loudspeaker cables, and their 
conductive inefficiency is just one. The cost and the insidiously poisonous nature of the metal 
are two more. Nonetheless, it is reported that the Hitachi Cable company has experimented with 
speaker cables made from polythene tubes filled with mercury. There appear to have been no 
plans to put such a product on the market. RoHS compliance might be a problem. 
 We also see that the resistivity of solder is high compared with that of copper – nine times 
higher if you compare copper with the 60/40 tin/lead solder. This is unlikely to be a problem 
as the thickness of solder the current passes through in a typical joint is very small. There are 
many formulations of lead-free solder, with varying resistivities, but all are high compared 
with copper.

 The metallurgy of copper 
 Copper is a good conductor because the outermost electrons of its atoms have a large mean 
free path between collisions. The electrical resistivity of a metal is inversely related to this 
electron mean free path, which in the case of copper is approximately 100 atomic spacings. 
 Copper is normally used as a very dilute alloy known as electrolytic tough pitch (ETP) 
copper, which consists of very high purity metal alloyed with oxygen in the range of 100 to 
650 ppm. In view of the wide exposure that the concept of oxygen-free copper has had in the 
audio business, it is worth underlining that the oxygen is deliberately alloyed with the copper 
to act as a scavenger for dissolved hydrogen and sulphur, which become water and sulphur 
dioxide. Microscopic bubbles form in the mass of metal but are completely eliminated during 
hot rolling. The main use of oxygen-free copper is in conductors exposed to a hydrogen 
atmosphere at high temperatures. ETP copper is susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement in 
these circumstances, which arise in the hydrogen-cooled alternators in power stations.

 Gold and its uses 
 As stated above, gold has a higher resistivity than copper, and there is no incentive to use it as 
the bulk metal of conductors, not least because of its high cost. However it is very useful as 
a thin coating on contacts because it is almost immune to corrosion, though it is chemically 
attacked by fluorine and chlorine (if there is a significant amount of either gas in the air then 
your medical problems will be more pressing than your electrical ones). Other electrical 
components are sometimes gold-plated simply because the appearance is attractive. A carat 
(or karat) is a 1/24 part, so 24-carat gold is the pure element, while 18-carat gold contains 
only 75% of the pure metal. 18-carat gold is the sort usually used for jewellery as it retains 
the chemical inertness of pure gold but is much harder and more durable; the usual alloying 
elements are copper and silver.
 18-carat gold is widely used in jewellery and does not tarnish, so it is initially puzzling to 
find that some electronic parts plated with it have a protective transparent coating which 
the manufacturer claims to be essential to prevent blackening. The answer is that if gold is 
plated directly onto copper, the copper diffuses through the gold and tarnishes on its surface. 
The standard way of preventing this is to plate a layer of nickel onto the copper to prevent 
diffusion, then plate on the gold. I have examined some transparent-coated gold-plated parts 
and found no nickel layer; presumably the manufacturer finds the transparent coating is 
cheaper than another plating process to deposit the nickel. However, it does not look as good 
as bare gold. 
 Cable and wiring resistance 
 Electrical cable is very often specified by its cross-sectional area and current-carrying 
capacity, and the resistance per meter is seldom quoted. This can however be a very important 
parameter for assessing permissible voltage drops and for predicting the crosstalk that will be 
introduced between two signals when they unavoidably share a common ground conductor. 
Given the resistivity of copper from  Table 2.1 , the resistance R of L metres of cable is simply: 
 
R
resistivity L
area
  

 
(Equation 2.1)
 Note that the area, which is usually quoted in catalogues in square millimetres, must be 
expressed here in square metres to match up with the units of resistivity and length. Thus 
5 metres of cable with a cross-sectional area of 1.5mm 2 will have a resistance of: 
 (1.72  10 8 )  5/(0.0000015)  0.057 Ohms 
 This gives the resistance of our stretch of cable, and it is then simple to treat this as part of a 
potential divider to calculate the voltage drop down its length. 

Components 39
 PCB track resistance 
 It is also useful to be able to calculate the resistance of a PCB track for the same reasons. 
This is slightly less straightforward to do; given the smorgasbord of units that are in use 
in PCB technology, determining the cross-sectional area of the track can present some 
difficulty. 
 In the USA and the UK, and probably elsewhere, there is inevitably a mix of metric and 
imperial units on PCBs, as many important components come in dual in-line packages which 
are derived from an inch grid; track widths and lengths are therefore very often in thousands 
of an inch, universally (in the UK at least) referred to as ‘thou’. Conversely, the PCB 
dimensions and fixing-hole locations will almost certainly be metric as they interface with 
a world of metal fabrication and mechanical CAD that (except the USA) went metric many 
years ago. Add to this the UK practice of quoting copper thickness in ounces (the weight of a 
square foot of copper foil) and all the ingredients for dimensional confusion are in place. 
 Standard PCB copper foil is known as one ounce copper, having a thickness of 1.4 thou 
( 35 microns). Two-ounce copper is naturally twice as thick; the extra cost of specifying it is 
small, typically around 5% of the total PCB cost, and this is a very simple way of halving track 
resistance. It can of course be applied very easily to an existing design without any fear of 
messing up a satisfactory layout. Four-ounce copper can also be obtained but is more rarely 
used and is therefore much more expensive. If heavier copper than two-ounce is required, 
the normal technique is to plate two-ounce up to three-ounce copper. The extra cost of this is 
surprisingly small, in the region of 10% to 15%. 
   Given the copper thickness, multiplying by track width and length gives the cross-sectional 
area. Since resistivity is always in metric units, it is best to convert to metric at this point, so 
the table below gives area in square millimetres. This is then multiplied by the resistivity, not 
forgetting to convert the area to metres for consistency. This gives the ‘resistance’ column 
in the table, and it is then simple to treat this as part of a potential divider to calculate the 
usually unwanted voltage across the track. 
 For example, if the track in question is the ground return from an 8 Ω speaker load, this is the 
top half of a potential divider while the track is the bottom half, (I am of course ignoring here 
the fact loudspeakers are not purely resistive loads) and a quick calculation gives the fraction 
of the input voltage found along the track. This is expressed in the last column of  Table 2.2 
as attenuation in dB. This shows clearly that loudspeaker outputs should not have common 
return tracks or the interchannel crosstalk will be dire. 
 It is very clear from this table that relying on thicker copper on your PCB as a means of 
reducing path resistance is not very effective. In some situations it may be the only recourse, 
but in many cases a path of much lower resistance can be made by using 32/02 cable soldered 
between the two relevant points on the PCB. 

40 Chapter 2
 PCB tracks have a limited current capability because excessive resistive heating will break 
down the adhesive holding the copper to the board substrate, and ultimately melt the copper. 
This is normally only a problem in power amplifiers and power supplies. It is useful to assess 
if you are likely to have problems before committing to a PCB design, and  Table 2.3 , based 
on MIL-standard 275, gives some guidance. 
 Note that  Table 2.3 applies to tracks on the PCB surface only. Internal tracks in a multi-
layer PCB experience much less cooling, and need to be about three times as thick for the 
same temperature rise. This factor depends on laminate thickness and so on, and you need to 
consult your PCB vendor. 
 Traditionally, overheated tracks could be detected visually because the solder mask on top of 
them would discolour to brown. I am not sure if this still applies with modern solder mask 
materials, as in recent years I have been quite successful in avoiding overheated tracking.

 PCB track-to-track crosstalk 
 The previous section described how to evaluate the amount of crosstalk that can arise because 
of shared track resistances. Another crosstalk mechanism is caused by capacitance between 
PCB tracks. This is not very susceptible to calculation, so I did the following experiment to 
put some figures to the problem. 
 Figure 2.1 shows the setup; four parallel conductors, 1.9 inches long on a standard piece of 
0.1 inch pitch prototype board were used as test tracks. These are perhaps rather wider than 
the average PCB track, but one must start somewhere. The test signal was applied to track A, 
and track C was connected to a virtual-earth summing amplifier A1. 
 The tracks B and D were initially left floating. The results are shown as Trace 1 in  Figure 2.2 ; 
the coupling at 10 kHz is 65 dB, which is worryingly high for two tracks 0.2 inch apart. 
Note that the crosstalk increases steadily at 6 dB per octave, as it results from a very small 
capacitance driving into what is effectively a short circuit. 
 It has often been said that running a grounded screening track between two tracks that 
are susceptible to crosstalk has a beneficial effect, but how much good does it really do? 
Grounding track B, to place a screen between A and C, gives Trace 2 and has only improved 
matters by 9 dB; not the dramatic effect that might be expected from screening. The reason, 
of course, is that electric fields are very much three-dimensional, and if you could see the 
Figure 2.1: Test circuit for measuring track-to-track crosstalk on a PCB

42 Chapter 2
electrostatic ‘lines of force’ that appear in physics textbooks you would notice they arch up 
and over any planar screening such as a grounded track. It is easy to forget this when staring 
at a CAD display. There are of course two-layer and multi-layer PCBs, but the visual effect 
on a screen is still of several slices of 2-D. As Mr Spock remarked in one of the Star Trek 
films, ‘He’s intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two-dimensional thinking.’ 
 Grounding track D, beyond receiving track C, gives a further improvement of about 3 dB (Trace 3); 
this would clearly not happen if PCB crosstalk was simply a line-of-sight phenomenon. 
 To get more effective screening than this you must go into three dimensions too; with a double-
sided PCB you can put one track on each side, with ground plane opposite. With a 4-layer board 
it should be possible to sandwich critical tracks between two layers of ground plane, where they 
should be safe from pretty much anything. If you can’t do this and things are really tough you 
may need to resort to a screened cable between two points on the PCB; this is of course expensive 
in assembly time. If components, such as electrolytics with their large surface area, are talking to 
each other you may need to use a vertical metal wall, but this costs money. A more cunning plan is 
to use electrolytics not carrying signal, such as rail decouplers, as screening items. 
 The internal crosstalk between the two halves of a dual opamp is very low according to the 
manufacturer’s specs. Nevertheless, avoid having different channels going through the same 
opamp if you can because this will bring the surrounding components into close proximity, 
and will permit capacitive crosstalk. 
 Impedances and crosstalk: a case history 
 Capacitive crosstalk between two opamp outputs can be surprisingly troublesome. The usual 
isolating resistor on an opamp output is 47 Ω, and you might think that this impedance

is so low that the capacitive crosstalk between two of these outputs would be completely 
negligible, but . . . you would be wrong. 
 A stereo power amplifier had balanced input amplifiers with 47 Ω output isolating resistors 
included to prevent any possibility of instability although the opamps were driving only 
a few cm of PCB track rather than screened cables with their significant capacitance. Just 
downstream of these opamps was a switch to enable bi-amping by driving both left and right 
outputs with the left input. This switch and its associated tracking brought the left and right 
signals into close proximity, and the capacity between them was not negligible. 
 Crosstalk at low frequencies (below 1 kHz) was pleasingly low, being better than 129 dB 
up to 70Hz, which was the difference between the noise floor and the maximum signal level 
(the measured noise floor was unusually low at 114 dBu because each input amplifier was a 
quadruple noise cancelling type as described in  Chapter 18 , and that figure includes the noise 
from an AP System 1). At higher frequencies things were rather less gratifying, being 96 dB 
at 10 kHz, as shown by the ‘47R’ trace in   Figure 2.3 . In many applications this would be more 
than acceptable, but in this case the highest performance possible was being sought. 
Figure 2.3: Crosstalk between opamp outputs with 47 Ω and 10 Ω output isolating resistors

44 Chapter 2
 I therefore decided to reduce the output isolating resistors to 10 Ω, so the inter-channel 
capacitance would have less effect (checks were done at the time and all through the 
prototyping and pre-production process to make sure that this would be enough resistance to 
ensure opamp stability – it was). This handily reduced the crosstalk to 109 dB at 10 kHz, an 
improvement of 13 dB at zero cost. This is the ratio between the two resistor values. 
 The third trace marked ‘DIS’ shows the result of removing the isolating resistor from the 
speaking channel, so no signal reached the bi-amping switch. As usual, this reveals a further 
crosstalk mechanism, at about 117 dB, for reducing crosstalk is proverbially like peeling 
onions. There is layer after layer, and even strong men are reduced to tears. 
 Resistors 
 In the past there have been many types of resistor, including some interesting ones consisting 
of jars of liquid, but only a few kinds are likely to be met with now. These are usually 
classified by the kind of material used in the resistive element, as this has the most important 
influence on the fine details of performance. The major materials and types are shown in 
 Table 2.4 . 
 These values are illustrative only, and it would be easy to find exceptions. As always, the 
official data sheet for the component you have chosen is the essential reference. The voltage 
coefficient is a measure of linearity (lower is better) and its sinister significance is explained 
later. 
 It should be said that you are most unlikely to come across carbon composition resistors in 
modern signal circuitry, but they frequently appear in vintage valve equipment so they are 
included here. They also live on in specialised applications such as switch-mode snubbing 
circuits, where their ability to absorb a high peak power in a mass of material rather than a 
thin film is very useful.

 Carbon film resistors are currently still sometimes used in low-end consumer equipment, but 
elsewhere have been supplanted by the other three types. Note from  Table 2.4 that they have a 
significant voltage coefficient. 
 Metal film resistors are now the usual choice when any degree of precision or stability 
is required. These have no non-linearity problems at normal signal levels. The voltage 
coefficient is usually negligible. 
 Metal oxide resistors are more problematic. Cermet resistors and resistor packages are metal 
oxide, and are made of the same material as thick-film SM resistors. Thick-film resistors can 
show significant non-linearity at opamp-type signal levels, and should be kept out of high-
quality signal paths. 
 Wirewound resistors are indispensable when serious power needs to be handled. The average 
wirewound resistor can withstand very large amounts of pulse power for short periods, but in 
this litigious age component manufacturers are often very reluctant to publish specifications 
on this capability, and endurance tests have to be done at the design stage; if this part of the 
system is built first then it will be tested as development proceeds. The voltage coefficient is 
usually negligible. 
 Resistors for general PCB use come in both through-hole and surface-mount types. Through-
hole (TH) resistors can be any of the types tabled above; surface-mount (SM) resistors are 
always either metal film or metal oxide. There are also many specialised types; for example, 
high-power wirewound resistors are often constructed inside a metal case that can be bolted 
down to a heatsink. 
 Through-hole resistors 
 These are too familiar to require much description; they are available in all the materials 
mentioned above; carbon film, metal film, metal oxide, and wirewound. There are a 
few other sorts, such as metal foil, but they are restricted to specialised applications. 
Conventional through-hole resistors are now almost always 250 mW 1% metal film. 
Carbon film used to be the standard resistor material, with the expensive metal film 
resistors reserved for critical places in circuitry where low temperatures and an absence 
of excess noise were really important, but as metal film got cheaper so it took over many 
applications. 
 TH resistors have the advantage that their power and voltage rating greatly exceed those 
of surface-mount versions. They also have a very low voltage coefficient, which for 
our purposes is of the first importance. On the downside, the spiral construction of the 
resistance element means they have much greater parasitic inductance; this is not a problem 
in audio work. 

46 Chapter 2
 Surface-mount resistors 
 Surface-mount resistors come in two main formats, the common chip type, and the rarer (and 
much more expensive) MELF format. 
 Chip surface-mount (SM) resistors come in a flat tombstone format, which varies over a wide 
size range; see  Table 2.5 . 
 MELF surface-mount resistors have a cylindrical body with metal endcaps, the resistive 
element is metal film, and the linearity is therefore as good as conventional resistors, with a 
voltage coefficient of less than 1 ppm. MELF is apparently an acronym for ‘Metal ELectrode 
Face-bonded’ though most people I know call them ‘Metal Ended Little Fellows’ or 
something quite close to that. 
 Surface-mount resistors may have thin-film or thick-film resistive elements. The latter are 
cheaper and so more often encountered, but the price differential has been falling in recent 
years. Both thin film and thick film SM resistors use laser trimming to make fine adjustments 
of resistance value during the manufacturing process. There are important differences in their 
behaviour. 
 Thin film (metal film) SM resistors use a nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) film as the resistance 
material. A very thin Ni-Cr film of less than 1 um thickness is deposited on the aluminium oxide 
substrate by sputtering under vacuum. Ni-Cr is then applied onto the substrate as conducting 
electrodes. The use of a metal film as the resistance material allows thin film resistors to provide 
a very low temperature coefficient, much lower current noise and vanishingly small non-linearity. 
Thin film resistors need only low laser power for trimming (one-third of that required for thick 
film resistors) and contain no glass-based material. This prevents possible micro-cracking during 
laser trimming and maintains the stability of the thin film resistor types.

Components 47
 Thick film resistors normally use ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) as the resistance material, mixed 
with glass-based material to form a paste for printing on the substrate. The thickness of 
the printing material is usually 12 μm. The heat generated during laser trimming can cause 
micro-cracks on a thick film resistor containing glass-based materials which can adversely 
affect stability. Palladium/silver (PdAg) is used for the electrodes. 
 The most important thing about thick-film surface-mount resistors from our point of view 
is that they do not obey Ohm’s Law very well. This often comes as a shock to people 
who are used to TH resistors, which have been the highly linear metal film type for many 
years. They have much higher voltage coefficients than TH resistors, at between 30 and 
100 ppm. The non-linearity is symmetrical about zero voltage and so gives rise to third-
harmonic distortion. Some SM resistor manufacturers do not specify voltage coefficient, 
which usually means it can vary disturbingly between different batches and different 
values of the same component, and this can have dire results on the repeatability of design 
performance. 
 Chip-type surface-mount resistors come in standard formats with names based on size, 
such as 1206, 0805, 0603 and 0402. For example, 0805, which used to be something like 
the ‘standard’ size, is 0.08 in by 0.05 in; see  Table 2.5 . The smaller 0603 is now more 
common. Both 0805 and 0603 can be placed manually if you have a steady hand and a good 
magnifying glass. 
 The 0402 size is so small that the resistors look rather like grains of pepper; manual 
placing is not really feasible. They are only used in equipment where small size is critical, 
such as mobile phones. They have very restricted voltage and power ratings, typically 
50 V and 100 mW. The voltage rating of TH resistors can usually be ignored, as power 
dissipation is almost always the limiting factor, but with SM resistors it must be kept 
firmly in mind. 
 Recently, even smaller surface-mount resistors have been introduced; for example several 
vendors offer 0201, and Panasonic and Yageo offer 01005 resistors. The latter are truly tiny, 
being about 0.4 mm long; a thousand of them weigh less than a twentieth of a gram. They 
are intended for mobile phones, palmtops, and hearing aids; a full range of values is available 
from 10 Ω to 1 MΩ (jumper inclusive). Hand placing is really not an option. 
 Surface-mount resistors have a limited power-dissipation capability compared with their 
through-hole cousins, because of their small physical size. SM voltage ratings are also 
restricted, for the same reason. It is therefore sometimes necessary to use two SM resistors 
in series or parallel to meet these demands, as this is usually more economic than hand-fitting 
a through-hole component of adequate rating. If the voltage rating is the issue then the 
SM resistors will obviously have to be connected in series to gain any benefit. 

48 Chapter 2
 Resistor accuracy 
 As noted in  Table 2.4 , the most common tolerance for metal film resistors today is 1%. If you want 
a closer tolerance then the next that is readily available is 0.1%; while there is considerable 
variation in price, roughly speaking the 0.1% resistors will be ten times as expensive. 
 Resistors are widely available in the E24 series (24 values per decade) and the E96 series 
(96 values per decade). There is also the E192 series (you guessed it, 192 values per decade) 
but this is less freely available. Using the E96 or E192 series means you have to keep a lot 
of different resistor values in stock; when non-E24 values are required it is usually more 
convenient to use a series or parallel combination of two E24 resistors. 
 Using two or more resistors to make up a desired value has a valuable hidden benefit. If it is 
done correctly it will actually increase the average accuracy of the total resistance value so 
it is  better than the tolerance of the individual resistors; this may sound paradoxical but it is 
simply an expression of the fact that random errors tend to cancel out if you have a number 
of them. This also works for capacitors, and indeed any parameter that is subject to random 
variations, but for the time being we will focus on the concrete example of multiple resistors. 
Note that this assumes that the mean (i.e. average) value of the resistors is accurate. It is 
generally a sound assumption as it is much easier to control a single value such as the mean 
in a manufacturing process than to control all the variables that lead to scatter about that 
mean. This is confirmed by measurement. 
 Component values are usually subject to a Gaussian distribution, also called a normal 
distribution. It has a familiar peaky shape, not unlike a resonance curve, showing that the 
majority of the values lie near the central mean, and that they get rarer the further away from 
the mean you look. This is a very common distribution, cropping up wherever there are many 
independent things going on that affect the value of a given component. The distribution is 
defined by its mean, and its standard deviation, which is the square-root of the sum of the 
squares of the distances from the mean – the RMS-sum, in other words. Sigma (σ) is the 
standard symbol for standard deviation. A Gaussian distribution will have 68.3% of its values 
within ±1 σ, 95.4% within ±2 σ, 99.7% within ±3 σ, and 99.9% within ±4 σ. This is illustrated 
in  Figure 2.4 , where the X-axis is calibrated in numbers of standard deviations on either side 
of the central mean value. 
 If we put two equal-value resistors in series, or in parallel, (see  Figures 2.5a and  2.5b ) the total 
value has proportionally a narrower distribution than that of the original components. The 
standard deviation of summed components is the sum of the squares of the individual 
standard deviations, as shown in Equation 2.2. σ sum is the overall standard deviation, and σ 1 
and σ 2 are the standard deviations of the two resistors in series.

 Thus if we have four 100 Ω 1% resistors in series, the standard deviation of the total 
resistance increases only by the square root of 4, that is 2 times, while the total resistance 
has increased by 4 times; thus we have made a 0.5% close-tolerance 400 Ω resistor, for 
only twice the price, whereas a 0.1% resistor would be at least ten times the price and may 
give more accuracy than we need. There is a happy analogue here with the use of multiple 
amplifiers to reduce electrical noise; we are using essentially the same technique of rms-
summation to reduce ‘statistical noise’. 
 You may object that putting four 1% resistors in series means that the worst-case errors can 
be four times as great. This is obviously true – if they are all 1% low, or 1% high, the total error 
will be 4%. But the probability of this occurring is actually very, very small indeed. The more 
resistors you combine, the more the values cluster together in the centre of the range. 
 The mathematics for series resistors is very simple (see Equation 2.2) but in other cases 
gets complicated very quickly. It also holds for two parallel resistors as in  Figure 2.5b , 
though this is mathematically much less obvious. I verified it by the use of Monte-Carlo 
methods [3]. A suitable random number generator is used to select two resistor values, and 
their combined value is calculated and recorded. This is repeated many times (by computer, 
obviously) and then the mean and standard deviation of all the accumulated numbers is 
recorded. This will never give the  exact  answer, but it will get closer and closer as you make 
more trials. For the series and parallel cases the standard deviation is 1/√ 2 of the standard 
deviation for a single resistor. If you are not wholly satisfied that this apparently magical 
improvement in average accuracy is genuine, seeing it happen on a spreadsheet makes a 
convincing demonstration. 
 In an Excel spreadsheet, random numbers with a uniform distribution are generated by the 
function RAND(), but random numbers with a Gaussian distribution and specified mean 
and standard deviation can be generated by the function NORMINV(). Let us assume we 
want to make an accurate 20 kΩ resistance. We can simulate the use of a single 1% tolerance 
resistor by generating a column of Gaussian random numbers with a mean of 20 and 
a standard deviation of 0.2; we need to use a lot of numbers to smooth out the statistical 
fluctuations, so we generate 400 of them. As a check we calculate the mean and standard 
deviation of our 400 random numbers using the AVERAGE() and STDEV() functions. The 
results will be very close to 20 and 0.2 but not identical, and will change every time we hit 
the F9 recalculate key as this generates a new set of random numbers. The results of five 
recalculations are shown in  Table 2.6 , demonstrating that 400 numbers are enough to get us 
quite close to our targets. 
 To simulate two 10 kΩ resistors of 1% tolerance in series we generate two columns of 400 
Gaussian random numbers with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 0.1. We then set 
up a third column which is the sum of the two random numbers on the same row, and if 
we calculate the mean and standard deviation using AVERAGE() and STDEV() again, we 

Components 51
find that the mean is still very close to 20 but the standard deviation is reduced on average 
by the expected factor of √ 2. The result of five trials is shown in  Table 2.7 . Repeating this 
experiment with two 40 kΩ resistors in parallel gives the same results. 
   If we repeat this experiment by making our 20 kΩ resistance from a series combination 
of four 5 kΩ resistors of 1% tolerance we generate four columns of 400 Gaussian random 
numbers with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 0.05. We sum the four numbers on 
the same row to get a fifth column, and calculate the mean and standard deviation of that. 
The result of five trials is shown in  Table 2.8 . The mean is very close to 20 but the standard 
deviation is now reduced on average by a factor of √ 4, which is 2.

 I think this demonstrates quite convincingly that the spread of values is reduced by a 
factor equal to the square root of the number of the components used. The principle works 
equally well for capacitors or indeed any quantity with a Gaussian distribution of values. 
The downside is the fact that the improvement depends on the square root of the number 
of equal-value components used, which means that big improvements require a lot of parts 
and the method quickly gets unwieldy.  Table 2.9 demonstrates how this works; the rate of 
improvement slows down noticeably as the number of parts increases. The largest number 
of components I have ever used in this way for a production design is five. Constructing a 
0.1% resistance from 1% resistors would require a hundred of them, and is hardly a practical 
proposition. It would cost more than just buying a 0.1% resistor. 
 You may be wondering what happens if the series resistors used are  not equal. If you are 
in search of a particular value the method that gives the best resolution is to use one large 
resistor value and one small one to make up the total, as this gives a very large number of 
possible combinations. However, the accuracy of the final value is essentially no better 
than that of the large resistor. Two equal resistors, as we have just demonstrated, give a √ 2 
improvement in accuracy, and near-equal resistors give almost as much, but the number of 
combinations is very limited, and you may not be able to get very near the value you want. 
The question is, how much improvement in accuracy can we get with resistors that are some 
way from equal, such as one resistor being twice the size of the other? 
 The mathematical answer is very simple; even when the resistor values are not equal, the overall 
standard deviation is still the rms-sum of the standard deviations of the two resistors, as shown 
in Equation 2.2 above; σ 1 and σ 2 are the standard deviations of the two resistors in series. Note

that this equation is only correct if there is no correlation between the two values; this is true for 
two separate resistors but would not hold for two film resistors on the same substrate. 
 Since both resistors have the same percentage tolerance, the larger of the two has the greater 
standard deviation, and dominates the total result. The minimum total deviation is thus 
achieved with equal resistor values.  Table 2.10 shows how this works; using two resistors in 
the ratio 2:1 or 3:1 still gives a worthwhile improvement in average accuracy. 
 The entries for 19.5k  500 and 19.9k  100 demonstrate that when one large resistor value 
and one small are used to get a particular value, its accuracy is very little better than that of 
the large resistor alone. 
 Other resistor combinations 
 So far we have looked at serial and parallel combinations of components to make up one 
value, as in  Figure 2.5 . Other important combinations are the resistive divider in  Figure 2.5c , 
(frequently used as the negative-feedback network for non-inverting amplifiers) and the 
inverting amplifier in  Figure 2.5f where the gain is set by the ratio R2/R1. All resistors are 
assumed to have the same tolerance about an exact mean value. 
 I suggest it is not obvious whether the divider ratio of  Figure 2.5c , which is R2/(R1  R2), 
will be more or less accurate than the resistor tolerance, even in the simple case with R1  R2. 
However, the Monte-Carlo method shows that in this case partial cancellation of errors still 
occurs and the division ratio is more accurate by a factor of √ 2.

 This factor depends on the divider ratio, as a simple physical argument shows: 
 •  If the top resistor R1 is zero, then the divider ratio is obviously one with complete 
accuracy, the resistor values are irrelevant, and the output voltage tolerance is zero. 
 •  If the bottom resistor R2 is zero, there is no output and accuracy is meaningless, but 
if instead R2 is very small compared with R1 then the R1 completely determines the 
current through R2, and R2 turns this into the output voltage. Therefore the tolerances 
of R1 and R2 act independently, and so the combined output voltage tolerance is 
worse by their rms-sum √ 2. 
 Some more Monte-Carlo work, with 8000 trials per data point, revealed that there is linear 
relationship between accuracy and the ‘tap position’ of the output between R1 and R2, as shown 
in  Figure 2.6 . With R1  R2 the tap is at 50%, and accuracy improved by a factor of √ 2, as 
noted above. With a tap at about 30% (R1  7 kΩ, R2  3 kΩ) the accuracy is the same as the 
resistors used. This ‘tap’ concept is  not applicable to potentiometers as the two sections of the 
pot are not uncorrelated. 
Figure 2.6: The accuracy of the output of a resistive divider made up with components of the 
same tolerance varies with tap position and the divider ratio.

Components 55
 The two-tap divider ( Figure 2.5d ) and three-tap divider ( Figure 2.5e ) were also given a 
Monte-Carlo-ing, though only for equal resistors. The two-tap divider has an accuracy factor 
of 0.404 at OUT 1 and 0.809 at OUT 2. These numbers are very close to √ 2/2√ 3 and √ 2/√ 3 
respectively. The three-tap divider has an accuracy factor of 0.289 at OUT 1, 0.500 at OUT 2, 
and 0.864 at OUT 3. The middle figure is clearly 1/2 (twice as many resistors as a one-tap 
divider so √ 2 times more accurate) while the first and last numbers are very close to √ 3/6 and √ 3/2 
respectively. It would be helpful if someone could prove analytically that the factors proposed 
are actually correct. 
 For the inverting amplifier of  Figure 2.5f , the accuracy of the gain is always √ 2 worse than 
the tolerance of the two resistors, assuming the tolerances are equal. The nominal resistor 
values have no effect on this. We therefore have the interesting situation that a non-inverting 
amplifier will always be equally or more accurate in its gain than an inverting amplifier. So 
far as I know this is a new result. 
 Resistor value distributions 
 At this point you may be complaining that this will only work if the resistor values have 
a Gaussian (also known as normal) distribution with the familiar peak around the mean 
(average) value. Actually, it is a happy fact that this effect does  not assume that the component 
values have a Gaussian distribution, as we shall see in a moment. An excellent 
account of how to handle statistical variations to enhance accuracy is in [4]. This deals with 
the addition of mechanical tolerances in optical instruments, but the principles are just the same. 
 You sometimes hear that this sort of thing is inherently flawed, because, for example, 
1% resistors are selected from production runs of 5% resistors. If you were using the 
5% resistors, then you would find there was a hole in the middle of the distribution; if you 
were trying to select 1% resistors from them, you would be in for a very frustrating time as 
they have already been selected out, and you wouldn’t find a single one. If instead you were 
using the 1% components obtained by selection from the 5% population, you would find that 
the distribution would be much flatter than Gaussian and the accuracy improvement obtained 
by combining them would be reduced, although there would still be a definite improvement. 
 However, don’t worry. In general this is not the way that components are manufactured 
nowadays, though it may have been so in the past. A rare contemporary exception is the 
manufacture of carbon composition resistors [5] where making accurate values is difficult, 
and selection from production runs, typically with a 10% tolerance, is the only practical way 
to get more accurate values. Carbon composition resistors have no place in audio circuitry, 
because of their large temperature and voltage coefficients and high excess noise, but they 
live on in specialised applications such as switch-mode snubbing circuits, where their 
ability to absorb high peak power in bulk material rather than a thin film is useful, and in RF 
circuitry where the inductance of spiral-format film resistors is unacceptable. 

56 Chapter 2
 So, having laid that fear to rest, what is the actual distribution of resistor values like? It is 
not easy to find out, as manufacturers are not exactly forthcoming with this sort of sensitive 
information, and measuring thousands of resistors with an accurate DVM is not a pastime 
that appeals to all of us. Any nugget of information in this area is therefore very welcome. 
 Hugo Kroeze [6] reported the result of measuring 211 metal film resistors from the same 
batch with a nominal value of 10 kΩ and 1% tolerance. He concluded that: 
1.  The mean value was 9.995k Ω (0.05% low). 
2.  The standard deviation was about 10 Ω, i.e. only 0.1%. This spread in value is 
surprisingly small (the resistors were all from the same batch, and the spread across 
batches widely separated in manufacture date might have been less impressive). 
3.  All resistors were within the 1% tolerance range. 
4.  The distribution appeared to be Gaussian, with no evidence that it was a subset from a 
larger distribution. 
 I decided to add my own morsel of data to this. I measured 100 ordinary metal film 1kΩ 
resistors of 1% tolerance from Yageo, a Chinese manufacturer, and very tedious it was too. 
I used a recently-calibrated 4.5 digit meter. 
1.  The mean value was 997.66 Ω (0.23% low). 
2.  The standard deviation was 2.10 Ω, i.e. 0.21%. 
3.  All resistors were within the 1% tolerance range. All but one was within 0.5%, with the 
outlier at 0.7%. 
4.  The distribution appeared to be Gaussian, with no evidence that it was a subset from a 
larger distribution. 
 These are only two reports, and it would be nice to have more confirmation, but there seems 
to be no reason to doubt that the mean value is very well controlled, and the spread is under 
good control as well. The distribution of resistance values appears to be Gaussian with no 
evidence of the most accurate specimens being selected out. Whenever I have attempted this 
kind of statistical improvement in accuracy, I have always found that the expected benefit 
really does appear in practice. 
 The uniform distribution 
 As I mentioned earlier, improving average accuracy by combining resistors does not depend 
on the resistance value having a Gaussian distribution. Even a batch of resistors with a 
uniform distribution gives better accuracy when two of them are combined. A uniform 

Components 57
distribution of component values may not be likely but the result of combining two or more 
of them is highly instructive, so stick with me for a bit. 
 Figure 2.7a shows a uniform distribution that cuts off abruptly at the limits L and L, and 
represents 10 kΩ resistors of 1% tolerance. We will assume again that we want to make a more 
accurate 20 kΩ resistance. If we put two of the uniform-distribution 10 kΩ resistors in series, 
we get not another uniform distribution, but the triangular distribution shown in   Figure 2.7b  . 
This shows that the total resistance values are already starting to cluster in the centre; it is 
possible to have the extreme values of 19.8 kΩ and 20.2 kΩ, but it is very unlikely. 
 Figure 2.7c shows what happens if we use more resistors to make the final value; when four 
are used the distribution is already beginning to look like a Gaussian distribution, and as we 
increase the number of components to 8 and then 16, the resemblance becomes very close. 
 Uniform distributions have a standard deviation just as Gaussian ones do. It is calculated 
from the limits L and L as in Equation 2.3. Likewise, the standard deviation of a triangular 
distribution can be calculated from its limits L and L as in Equation 2.4

58 Chapter 2
 Applying Equation 2.3 to the uniformly-distributed 10 kΩ 1% resistors in  Figure 2.7a , we 
get a standard deviation of 0.0577. Applying Equation 2.4 to the triangular distribution of 
20 kΩ resistance values in  Figure 2.7b , we get 0.0816. The mean value has doubled, but the 
standard deviation has less than doubled, so we get an improvement in average accuracy; the 
ratio is √ 2, just as it was for two resistors with a Gaussian distribution. This is also easy to 
demonstrate with Monte-Carlo methods on a spreadsheet. 
 Resistor imperfections 
 It is well-known that resistors have inductance and capacitance, and vary somewhat in 
resistance with temperature. Unfortunately there are other less obvious imperfections, such as 
excess noise and non-linearity; these can get forgotten because parameters describing how bad 
they are are often omitted from component manufacturer’s data sheets. 
 Being components in the real world, resistors are not perfect examples of resistance and 
nothing else. Their length is not infinitely small and so they have series inductance; this is 
particularly true for the many kinds that use a spiral resistive element. Likewise, they exhibit 
stray capacitance between each end, and also between the various parts of the resistive 
element. Both effects can be significant at high frequencies, but can usually be ignored below 
100 kHz unless you are using very high or low resistance values. 
 It is a sad fact that resistors change their value with temperature.  Table 2.4 shows some 
typical temperature coefficients. This is not likely to be a problem in audio applications, 
where the temperature range is small and extreme precision is not required unless you are 
designing measurement equipment. Carbon film resistors are markedly inferior to metal film 
in this area. 
 Resistor excess noise 
 All resistors, no matter what their resistive material or mode of construction, generate 
Johnson noise. This is white noise, its level being determined solely by the resistance value, 
the absolute temperature, and the bandwidth over which the noise is being measured. It is 
based on fundamental physics and is not subject to negotiation. In some cases it places the limit 
on how quiet a circuit can be, though the noise from active devices is often more significant. 
Johnson noise is covered in  Chapter 1 . 
 Excess resistor noise refers to the fact that some kinds of resistor, with a constant voltage 
drop imposed across them, generate excess noise in addition to its inherent Johnson noise. 
According to classical physics, passing a current through a resistor should have no effect on 
its noise behaviour; it should generate the same Johnson noise as a resistor with no steady 
current flow. In reality, some types of resistors do generate excess noise when they have a 
DC voltage across them. It is a very variable quantity, but is essentially proportional to the 

Components 59
DC voltage across the component, a typical spec being ‘1 μV/V’ and it has a 1/ f frequency 
distribution. Typically it could be a problem in biasing networks at the input of amplifier 
stages. It is usually only of interest if you are using carbon or thick film resistors- metal film 
and wirewound types should have very little excess noise. 1/ f noise does not have a Gaussian 
amplitude distribution, which makes it difficult to assess reliably from a small set of data 
points. A rough guide to the likely specs is given in  Table 2.11 .
 The level of excess resistor noise changes with resistor type, size, and value in Ohms; here 
are the relevant factors: 
 •  Thin film resistors are markedly quieter than thick film resistors; this is due to the 
homogeneous nature of thin film resistive materials which are metal alloys such as 
nickel-chromium deposited on a substrate. The thick film resistive material is a mixture 
of metal (often Ruthenium) oxides and glass particles; the glass is fused into a matrix for 
the metal particles by high temperature firing. The higher excess noise levels associated 
with thick film resistors are a consequence of their heterogeneous structure, due to the 
particulate nature of the resistive material. The same applies to carbon-film resistors 
where the resistive medium is finely-divided carbon dispersed in a polymer binder. 
 •  A physically large resistor has lower excess noise than a small resistor. In the same 
resistor range, the highest wattage versions have the lowest noise. See  Figure 2.8 . 
 •  A low ohmic value resistor has lower excess noise than a high ohmic value. Noise in 
μV per V rises approximately with the square root of resistance. See   Figure 2.8 again. 
 •  A low value of excess noise is associated with uniform constriction-free current flow; 
this condition is not well met in composite thick film materials. However, there are great 
variations among different thick film resistors. The most readily apparent relationship 
is between noise level and the amount of conductive material present. Everything else 
being equal, compositions with lower resistivity have lower noise levels.

Note: Wirewound resistors are normally considered to be completely free of excess noise.

60 Chapter 2
 •  Higher resistance values give higher excess noise since it is a statistical phenomenon 
related to the total number of charge carriers available within the resistive element; the 
fewer the total number of carriers present, the greater will be the statistical fluctuation. 
 Traditionally at this point in the discussion of excess resistor noise, the reader is warned 
against using carbon composition resistors because of their very bad excess noise 
characteristics. Carbon composition resistors are still made – their construction makes them 
good at handling pulse loads – but are not likely to be encountered in audio circuitry. 
 One of the great benefits of dual-rail opamp circuitry is that it is noticeably free of resistors 
with large DC voltages across them. The offset voltages and bias currents are far too low to 
cause trouble with resistor excess noise. However, if you are getting into low-noise hybrid 
discrete/opamp stages, such as the MC head amplifier in  Chapter 12 , you might have to 
consider it. 
 To get a feel for the magnitude of excess resistor noise, consider a 100 kΩ 1/4W carbon film 
resistor with 10 V across it. This, from the graph above, has an excess noise parameter of 
about 0.7 μV/V and so the excess noise will be of the order of 7 μV, which is 101 dBu. This 
definitely could be a problem in a low-noise preamplifier stage. 
 Resistor non-linearity 
 Ohm’s Law strictly is a statement about metallic conductors only. It is dangerous to assume 
that it also invariably applies to ‘resistors’ simply because they have a fixed value of

resistance marked on them; in fact resistors – whose main  raison d’etre is packing a lot of 
controlled resistance in a small space – do not always adhere to Ohm’s Law very closely. This 
is a distinct difficulty when trying to make low-distortion circuitry. 
 Resistor non-linearity is normally quoted by manufacturers as a voltage coefficient, usually 
the number of parts per million (ppm) that the resistor value changes when one volt is 
applied. The measurement standard for resistor non-linearity is IEC 6040. 
 Through-hole metal film resistors show perfect linearity at the levels of performance 
considered here, as do wirewound types. The voltage coefficient is less than 1 ppm. Carbon 
film resistors are quoted at less than 100 ppm; 100 ppm is however enough to completely 
dominate the distortion produced by active devices, if it is used in a critical part of the 
circuitry. Carbon composition resistors, probably of historical interest only, come in at about 
350 ppm, a point that might be pondered by connoisseurs of antique equipment. The greatest 
area of concern over non-linearity is thick-film surface-mount resistors, which have high and 
rather variable voltage coefficients; more on this below. 
 Table 2.12 (calculated with SPICE) gives the THD in the current flowing through the resistor 
for various voltage coefficients when a pure sine voltage is applied. If the voltage coefficient 
is significant this can be a serious source of non-linearity. 
 A voltage-coefficient model generates all the odd-order harmonics, at a decreasing level as 
order increases. No even-order harmonics occur as the model is symmetrical. This is covered 
in much more detail in my  Active Crossover book [7]. 
 My own test setup is shown in  Figure 2.9 . The resistors are usually of equal value, to give 
6 dB attenuation. A very low-distortion oscillator that can give a large output voltage is 
necessary; the results in  Figure 2.10 were taken at a 10 Vrms (22 dBu) input level. Here

thick-film SM and through-hole resistors are compared. The ‘Gen-mon’ trace at the bottom 
is the record of the analyzer reading the oscillator output and is the measurement floor of 
the AP System 1 used. The TH plot is higher than this floor, but this is not due to distortion. 
It simply reflects the extra Johnson noise generated by two 10 kΩ resistors. Their parallel 
combination is 5 kΩ, and so this noise is at 115.2 dBu. The SM plot, however, is higher 
again, and the difference is the distortion generated by the thick-film component. 
 For both thin-film and thick-film SM resistors, non-linearity increases with resistor value, and 
also increases as the physical size (and hence power rating) of the resistor shrinks. The thin-
film versions are much more linear; see  Figures 2.11 and  2.12 . Sometimes it is appropriate 
to reduce the non-linearity by using multiple resistors in series. If one resistor is replaced 
by two with the same voltage coefficient in series, the THD in the current flowing is halved. 
Similarly, three resistors reduces THD to a third of the original value. There are obvious

economic limits to this sort of thing, but it can be useful in specific cases, especially where 
the voltage rating of the resistor is a limitation. 
 Capacitors 
 Capacitors are diverse components. In the audio business their capacitance ranges from 10 pF 
to 100,000 μF, a ratio of 10 to the tenth power. In this they handily outdo resistors, which 
usually vary from 0.1 Ω to 10M Ω, a ratio of only 10 to the eighth power. However, if you

include the 10 GΩ bias resistors used in capacitor microphone head amplifiers, this range 
increases to ten to the eleventh. There is however a big gap between the 10 MΩ resistors, 
which are used in DC servos, and 10 GΩ microphone resistors; I am not aware of any audio 
applications for 1 GΩ resistors. 
 Capacitors also come in a wide variety of types of dielectric, the great divide being between 
electrolytic and non-electrolytic types. Electrolytics used to have  much wider tolerances than 
most components, but things have recently improved and ±20% is now common. This is still 
wider than for typical non-electrolytics which are usually ±10% or better. 
 This is not the place to reiterate the basic information about capacitor properties, which can 
be found from in sources. I will simply note that real capacitors fall short of the ideal circuit 
element in several ways, notably leakage, Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), dielectric 
absorption and non-linearity. 
 Capacitor leakage is equivalent to a high value resistance across the capacitor terminals, and 
allows a trickle of current to flow when a DC voltage is applied. It is usually negligible for 
non-electrolytics, but is much greater for electrolytics. 
 ESR is a measure of how much the component deviates from a mathematically pure 
capacitance. The series resistance is partly due to the physical resistance of leads and foils, 
and partly due to losses in the dielectric. It can also be expressed as tan-δ (tan-delta). Tan-
delta is the tangent of the phase angle between the voltage across and the current flowing 
through the capacitor. 
 Dielectric absorption is a well-known phenomenon; take a large electrolytic, charge it up, 
and then make sure it is fully discharged. Use a 10 Ω WW resistor across the terminals rather 
than a screwdriver unless you’re not too worried about either the screwdriver or the capacitor. 
Wait a few minutes, and the charge will partially reappear, as if from nowhere. This ‘memory 
effect’ also occurs in non-electrolytics to a lesser degree; it is a property of the dielectric, 
and is minimized by using polystyrene, polypropylene, NPO ceramic, or PTFE dielectrics. 
Dielectric absorption is invariably simulated by a linear model composed of extra resistors 
and capacitances; nevertheless dielectric absorption and distortion correlate across the 
different dielectrics. 
 Capacitor non-linearity is undoubtedly the least known of these shortcomings. A typical RC 
low-pass filter can be made with a series resistor and a shunt capacitor, and if you examine 
the output with a distortion analyzer, you may find to your consternation that the circuit is 
not linear. If the capacitor is a non-electrolytic type with a dielectric such as polyester, then 
the distortion is relatively pure third harmonic, showing that the effect is symmetrical. For a 
10 Vrms input, the THD level may be 0.001% or more. This may not sound like much but it 
is substantially greater than the mid-band distortion of a good opamp. Capacitor non-linearity 
is dealt with at greater length below. 

Components 65
 Capacitors are used in audio circuitry for three main functions, where their possible non-
linearity has varying consequences: 
1.  Coupling or DC blocking capacitors. These are usually electrolytics, and if properly sized 
have a negligible signal voltage across them at the lowest frequencies of interest. The 
properties of the capacitor are pretty much unimportant unless current levels are high; 
power amplifier output capacitors can generate considerable mid-band distortion [8]. 
Much nonsense has been talked about mysterious coupling capacitor properties, but it is 
all nonsense. For small-signal use, as long as the signal voltage across the capacitor is 
kept low, non-linearity is not normally detectable. The capacitance value is non-critical, 
as it has to be, given the wide tolerances of electrolytics. 
2.  Supply filtering or decoupling capacitors. These are electrolytics if you are filtering out 
supply rail ripple, etc. and non-electrolytics, usually around 100 nF, when the task is 
to keep the supply impedance low at high frequencies and so keep opamps stable. The 
capacitance value is again non-critical. 
3.  Setting time-constants, for example the capacitors in the feedback network of an RIAA 
amplifier. This is a much more demanding application than the other two. Firstly, the 
actual value is now crucially important as it defines the accuracy of the frequency 
response. Secondly, there is by definition significant signal voltage across the capacitor 
and so non-linearity can be a serious problem. Non-electrolytics are normally used; 
sometimes an electrolytic is used to define the lower end of the bandwidth, but this is a 
bad practice likely to introduce distortion at the bottom of the frequency range. Small 
value ceramic capacitors are used for compensation purposes. 
 In subjectivist circles it is frequently asserted that electrolytic coupling capacitors (if they are 
permitted at all) should be bypassed by small non-electrolytics. There is no sense in this; if the 
main coupling capacitor has no signal voltage across it, the extra capacitor can have no effect. 
 Capacitor non-linearity examined 
 When attempting the design of linear circuitry, everyone knows that inductors and 
transformers with ferromagnetic core material can be a source of non-linearity. It is however 
less obvious that capacitors and even resistors can show non-linearity and generate some 
unexpected and very unwelcome distortion. Resistor non-linearity has been dealt with earlier 
in this chapter; let us examine the shortcomings of capacitors. 
 The definitive work on capacitor distortion is a magnificent series of articles by Cyril 
Bateman in  Electronics World [9]. The authority of this work is underpinned by Cyril’s 
background in capacitor manufacture (the series is long because it includes the development 
of a low-distortion THD test set in the first two parts). 

66 Chapter 2
 Capacitors generate distortion when they are actually implementing a time-constant- in other 
words, when there is a signal voltage across them. The normal coupling or DC-blocking 
capacitors have no significant signal voltage across them, as they are intended to pass all 
the information through, not to filter it or define the system bandwidth. Capacitors with no 
signal across them do not generally produce distortion at small-signal current levels. This 
was confirmed for all the capacitors tested below. However electrolytic types may do so at 
power amplifier levels where the current through them is considerable, such as in the output 
coupling capacitor of a power amplifier [8]. 
 Non-electrolytic capacitor non-linearity 
 It has often been assumed that non-electrolytic capacitors, which generally approach an 
ideal component more closely than electrolytics, and have dielectrics constructed in a totally 
different way, are free from distortion. It is not so. Some non-electrolytics show distortion at 
levels that is easily measured, and can exceed the distortion from the opamps in the circuit. 
Non-electrolytic capacitor distortion is primarily third harmonic, because the non-polarised 
dielectric technology is basically symmetrical. The problem is serious, because non-
electrolytic capacitors are commonly used to define time-constants and frequency responses 
(in RIAA equalisation networks, for example) rather than simply for DC-blocking. 
 Very small capacitances present no great problem. Simply make sure you are using the C0G 
(NP0) type, and so long as you choose a reputable supplier, there will be no distortion. I say 
‘reputable supplier’ because I did once encounter some allegedly C0G capacitors from China 
that showed significant non-linearity [10]. 
 Middle-range capacitors, from 1nF to 1μF, present more of a problem. Capacitors with 
a variety of dielectrics are available, including polyester, polystyrene, polypropylene, 
polycarbonate and polyphenylene sulphide, of which the first three are the most common 
(note that what is commonly called ‘polyester’ is actually polyethylene terephthalate, PET). 
 Figure 2.13 shows a simple low-pass filter circuit which, in conjunction with a good THD 
analyzer, can be used to get some insight into the distortion problem; it is intended to be 
representative of a real bit of audio circuitry. The values shown give a pole frequency, or 
3 dB roll-off point, at 710 Hz. Since it might be expected that different dielectrics give

different results (and they definitely do) we will start off with polyester, the smallest, most 
economical, and therefore the most common type for capacitors of this size. 
 The THD results for a microbox 220 nF 100 V capacitor with a polyester dielectric are shown 
in  Figure 2.14 , for input voltages of 10, 15 and 20 Vrms. They are unsettling. 
 The distortion is all third-harmonic and peaks at around 300 to 400 Hz, well below the pole 
frequency, and even with input limited to 10 Vrms, will exceed the non-linearity introduced 
by opamps such as the 5532 and the LM4562. Interestingly, the peak frequency changes with 
applied level. Below the peak, the voltage across the capacitor is constant but distortion falls 
as frequency is reduced, because the increasing impedance of the capacitor means it has less 
effect on a circuit node at a 1 kΩ impedance. Above the peak, distortion falls with increasing 
frequency because the low-pass circuit action causes the voltage across the capacitor to fall. 
 The level of distortion varies with different samples of the same type of capacitor; six of the 
above type were measured and the THD at 10 Vrms and 400 Hz varied from 0.00128% to 
0.00206%. This puts paid to any plans for reducing the distortion by some sort of cancellation 
method. The distortion can be seen in  Figure 2.15 to be a strong function of level, roughly 
tripling as the input level doubles. Third harmonic distortion normally quadruples for doubled 
level, so there may well be an unanswered question here. It is however clear that reducing 
the voltage across the capacitor reduces the distortion. This suggests that if cost is not the 
primary consideration, it might be useful to put two capacitors in series to halve the voltage, 
and the capacitance, and then double up this series combination to restore the original 
capacitance, giving the series-parallel arrangement in  Figure 2.11 . The results are shown in 
 Table 2.13 , and once more it can be seen that halving the level has reduced distortion by a

factor of three rather than four. The series-parallel arrangement obviously has limitations in 
terms of cost and PCB area occupied, but might be useful in some cases. 
   Clearly polyester gives significant distortion, despite its extensive use in audio circuitry of 
all kinds. 
 An unexpected complication was that every time a sample was re-measured, the distortion 
was lower than before. I found a steady reduction in distortion over time if a test signal 
was left applied; 9 Vrms at 1 kHz halved the THD over 11 hours. This is a semi-permanent 
change as some of the distortion returns over time when the signal is removed. This effect 
may be of little practical use, but it does demonstrate that polyester capacitors are more 
complicated than they look. For much more on this see [11]. 
 The next dielectric we will try is polystyrene. Capacitors with a polystyrene dielectric are 
extremely useful for some filtering and RIAA-equalisation applications because they can be 
obtained at a 1% tolerance at up to 10 nF at a reasonable price. They can be obtained in larger 
sizes at an unreasonable, or at any rate much higher, price. 
 The distortion test results are shown in  Figure 2.16 for a 4n7 2.5% capacitor; the series 
resistor R1 has been increased to 4.7 kΩ to keep the 3 dB point inside the audio 
band, and it is now at 7200 Hz. Note that the THD scale has been extended down to a

subterranean 0.0001%, and if it was plotted on the same scale as  Figure 2.14 it would be 
bumping along the bottom of the graph.  Figure 2.16 in fact shows no distortion at all, just 
the measurement noise floor, and the apparent rise at the HF end is simply due to the fact 
that the output level is decreasing, because of the low-pass action, and so the noise floor is 
relatively increasing. This is at an input level of 10 Vrms, which is about as high as might 
be expected to occur in normal opamp circuitry. The test was repeated at 20 Vrms, which 
might be encountered in discrete circuitry, and the results were the same. No measurable 
distortion. 
 The tests were done with four samples of 10 nF 1% polystyrene from LCR at 10 Vrms and 
20 Vrms, with the same results for each sample. This shows that polystyrene capacitors can 
be used with confidence; this is in complete agreement with Cyril Bateman’s findings [12]. 
 Having settled the issue of capacitor distortion below 10 nF, we need now to tackle 
capacitor values greater than 10 nF. Polyester having proven unsatisfactory, the next 
most common dielectric is polypropylene, and I might as well say at once that it was with 
considerable relief that I found these were effectively distortion-free in values up to 220 nF. 
 Figure 2.17 shows the results for four samples of a 220 nF 250 V 5% polypropylene capacitor 
from RIFA. Once more the plot shows no distortion at all, just the noise floor, the apparent 
rise at the HF end being increasing relative noise due to the low-pass roll-off. This is also 
in agreement with Cyril Bateman’s findings. Rerunning the tests at 20 Vrms gave the same 
result – no distortion. This is very pleasing, but there is a downside. Polypropylene capacitors

of this value and voltage rating are physically much larger than the commonly used 63 or 
100 V polyester capacitor, and more expensive. 
 It was therefore important to find out if the good distortion performance was a result of the 
250 V rating, and so I tested a series of polypropylene capacitors with lower voltage ratings 
from different manufacturers. Axial 47 nF 160 V 5% polypropylene capacitors from Vishay 
proved to be THD-free at both 10 Vrms and 20 Vrms. Likewise, microbox polypropylene 
capacitors from 10 nF to 47 nF, with ratings of 63 V and 160 V from Vishay and Wima 
proved to generate no measurable distortion, so the voltage rating appears not to be an issue. 
This finding is particularly important because the Vishay range has a 1% tolerance, making 
them very suitable for precision filters and equalisation networks. The 1% tolerance is 
naturally reflected in the price. 
 The only remaining issue with polypropylene capacitors is that the higher values (above 
100nF) appear to be currently only available with 250 V or 400 V ratings, and that means a 
physically big component. For example, the EPCOS 330 nF 400V 5% part has a footprint of 
26 mm by 6.5 mm, with a height of 15 mm. One way of dealing with this is to use a smaller 
capacitor in a capacitance multiplication configuration, so a 100 nF 1% component could be 
made to emulate 470 nF. It has to be said that the circuitry for this is only straightforward if 
one end of the capacitor is connected to ground. 
 When I first started looking at capacitor distortion, I thought that the distortion would 
probably be lowest for the capacitors with the highest voltage rating. I therefore tested some 
RF-suppression X2 capacitors, rated at 275 Vrms, which translates into a peak or

DC rating of 389 V. These are designed to be connected directly across the mains and 
therefore have a thick and tough dielectric layer. For some reason manufacturers seem to 
be very coy about saying exactly what the dielectric material is, normally describing them 
simply as ‘film capacitors’. A problem that surfaced immediately is that the tolerance is 10 
or 20%, not exactly ideal for precision filtering or equalisation. A more serious problem, 
however, is that they are far from distortion-free. Four samples of a 470 nF X2 capacitor 
showed THD between 0.002% and 0.003% at 10 Vrms. Clearly a high voltage rating alone 
does not mean low distortion. 
 Electrolytic capacitor non-linearity 
 Cyril Bateman’s series in  Electronics World [13] included two articles on electrolytic 
capacitor distortion. It proved to be a complex subject, and many long-held assumptions 
(such as ‘DC biasing always reduces distortion’) were shown to be quite wrong. Distortion 
was in general a good deal higher than for non-electrolytic capacitors 
 My view is that electrolytics should never, ever, under any circumstances, be used to set 
time-constants in audio. There should be a time-constant early in the signal path, based on 
a non-electrolytic capacitor, that determines the lower limit of the bandwidth, and all the 
electrolytic-based time-constants should be much longer so that the electrolytic capacitors 
can never have significant signal voltages across them and so never generate measurable 
distortion. There is of course also the point that electrolytics have large tolerances, and cannot 
be used to set accurate time-constants anyway. 
 However, even if you obey this rule, you can still get into deep trouble.  Figure 2.18 shows a 
simple high-pass test circuit designed to represent an electrolytic capacitor in use for coupling 
or DC-blocking. The load of 1 kΩ is the sort of value that can easily be encountered if you 
are using low-impedance design principles. The calculated 3 dB roll-off point is 3.38 Hz, 
so the attenuation at 10 Hz, at the very bottom of the audio band, will be only 0.47 dB; at 
20 Hz it will be only 0.12 dB, which is surely a negligible loss. As far as frequency response 
goes, we are doing fine. But . . . examine  Figure 2.19 , which shows the measured distortion 
of this arrangement. Even if we limit ourselves to a 10 Vrms level, the distortion at 50 Hz 
is 0.001%, already above that of a good opamp. At 20 Hz it has risen to 0.01%, and by 
Figure 2.18: High-pass test circuit for examining electrolytic capacitor distortion

72 Chapter 2
10 Hz a most unwelcome 0.05%. The THD is increasing by a ratio of 4.8 times for each 
octave fall in frequency, in other words increasing faster than a square law. The distortion 
residual is visually a mixture of second and third harmonic, and the levels proved surprisingly 
consistent for a large number of 47 μF 25 V capacitors of different ages and from different 
manufacturers. 
 Figure 2.19 also shows that the distortion rises rapidly with level; at 50 Hz going from 
an input of 10 Vrms to 15 Vrms almost doubles the THD reading. To underline the point, 
consider  Figure 2.20 , which shows the measured frequency response of the circuit with 47 μF 
and 1 KΩ; note the effect of the capacitor tolerance on the real versus calculated figures. The 
roll-off that does the damage, by allowing an AC voltage to exist across the capacitor, is very 
modest indeed – less than 0.2 dB at 20 Hz. 
 Having demonstrated how insidious this problem is, how do we fix it? Changing capacitor 
manufacturer is no help. Using 47 μF capacitors of higher voltage does not work – tests 
showed there is very little difference in the amount of distortion generated. An exception was 
the sub-miniature style of electrolytic, which was markedly worse. 
 The answer is simple – just make the capacitor bigger in value. This reduces the voltage 
across it in the audio band, and since we have shown that the distortion is a strong function 
of the voltage across the capacitor, the amount produced drops more than proportionally. The 
result is seen in  Figure 2.21 , for increasing capacitor values with a 10 Vrms input. 
Figure 2.19: Electrolytic capacitor distortion from the circuit in Figure 2.13. Input level 10, 15 
and 20 Vrms

capacitor distortion

10 Vrms

74 Chapter 2
 Replacing C1 with a 100 μF 25 V capacitor drops the distortion at 20 Hz from 0.0080% to 
0.0017%, an improvement of 4.7 times; the voltage across the capacitor at 20 Hz has been 
reduced from 1.66 Vrms to 790 mVrms. A 220 μF 25 V capacitor reduces the voltage across 
itself to 360 mV, and gives another very welcome reduction to 0.0005% at 20 Hz, but it is 
necessary to go to 1000 μF 25 V to obtain the bottom trace, which is indistinguishable from 
the noise floor of the AP-2702 test system. The voltage across the capacitor at 20 Hz is now 
only 80 mV. From this data, it appears that the AC voltage across an electrolytic capacitor 
should be limited to below 80 mVrms if you want to avoid distortion. I would emphasise 
that these are ordinary 85 °C rated electrolytic capacitors, and in no sense special or 
premium types. 
 This technique can be seen to be highly effective, but it naturally calls for larger and 
somewhat more expensive capacitors, and larger footprints on a PCB. This can be to some 
extent countered by using capacitors of lower voltage, which helps to bring back down the 
CV product and hence the can size. I tested 1000 μF 16 V and 1000 μF 6V3 capacitors, and 
both types gave exactly the same results as the 1000 μF 25 V part in  Figure 2.21 , with useful 
reductions in CV product and can size. This does of course assume that the capacitor is, as is 
usual, being used to block small voltages from opamp offsets to prevent switch clicks and pot 
noises rather than for stopping a substantial DC voltage. 
 The use of large coupling capacitors in this way does require a little care, because we are 
introducing a long time-constant into the circuit. Most opamp circuitry is pretty much 
free of big DC voltages, but if there are any, the settling time after switch-on may become 
undesirably long. 
 More information on capacitor distortion in specific applications can be found in  Chapters 3 
and  8 . 
 Inductors 
 For several reasons, inductors are unpopular with circuit designers. They are relatively 
expensive, often because they need to be custom-made. Unless they are air-cored (which 
limits their inductance to low values) the core material is a likely source of non-linearity. 
Some types produce substantial external magnetic fields, which can cause crosstalk if they 
are placed close together, and similarly they can be subject to the induction of interference 
from other external fields. In general they deviate from being an ideal circuit element much 
more than resistors or capacitors. 
 It is rarely, if ever, essential to use inductors in signal-processing circuitry. Historically they 
were used in tone controls, before the Baxandall configuration swept all before it, and their 
last applications were probably in mid EQ controls for mixing consoles and in LCR filters 
for graphic equalisers. These too were gone by the end of the seventies, being replaced 

Components 75
by active filters and gyrators, to the considerable relief of all concerned (except inductor 
manufacturers). 
 The only place where inductors are essential is when the need for galvanic isolation, or 
enhanced EMC immunity, makes input and output transformers desirable, and even then they 
need careful handling; see  Chapters 18 and  10 on line-in and line-out circuitry.

 Discrete transistor circuitry 
 This chapter deals with small-signal design using discrete transistors, specifically BJT’s. 
Many things found in standard textbooks are skated over quickly. It concentrates on audio 
issues, and gives information that I do not think appears anywhere else, including the 
distortion behaviour of various configurations. 
 Why use discrete transistor circuitry? 
 Circuitry made with discrete transistors is not obsolete. It is appropriate when: 
 •  A load must be driven to higher voltages than an opamp can sustain between the 
supply rails. Opamps are mostly restricted to supply voltages of ±18 or ±20 Volts. 
Hybrid-construction amplifiers, typically packaged in TO3 cans, will operate from 
rails as high as ±100 V but they are very expensive, and not optimised for audio use in 
parameters like crossover distortion. Discrete circuitry provides a viable alternative, 
but it must never be forgotten that excessive output signal levels may damage opamp 
equipment. Hifi is very rarely equipped with input voltage protection. 
 •  A load requires more drive current, because of its low impedance, than an opamp can 
provide without overheating or current-limiting; e.g. any audio power amplifier. 
 •  The best possible noise performance is required. Discrete bipolar transistors can 
outperform opamps, particularly with low source resistances, say 500 Ω or less. The 
commonest examples are moving-coil head amps and microphone preamplifiers. These 
almost invariably use a discrete input device or devices, with the open-loop gain (for 
linearity) and load-driving capability provided by an opamp which may itself have fairly 
humble noise specs. 
 •  The best possible distortion performance is demanded. Most opamps have Class-B or AB 
output stages, and many of them (though certainly not all) show clear crossover artefacts 
on the distortion residual. A discrete opamp can dissipate more power than an IC, and so 
can have a Class-A output stage, sidestepping the crossover problem completely. 
 •  When it would be necessary to provide a low-voltage supply to run just one or two 
opamps. The cost of extra transformer windings, rectifiers, reservoirs, and regulators will 

78 Chapter 3
buy a lot of discrete transistors. For example, if you need a buffer stage to drive a power 
amplifier from a low impedance, it may be more economical, and save space and weight, 
to use a discrete emitter-follower running from the same rails as the power amplifier. In 
these days of auto-insertion fitting the extra parts on the PCB will cost very little. 
 •  Purely for marketing purposes, as you think you can mine a vein of customers that 
don’t trust opamps. 
 When studying the higher reaches of discrete design, the most fruitful source of information 
is paradoxically papers on analogue IC design. This applies with particular force to design 
with BJTs. The circuitry used in ICs can rarely be directly adapted for use with discrete 
semiconductors, because some features such as multiple collector transistors and differing 
emitter areas simply do not exist in the discrete transistor world; it is the basic principles 
of circuit operation that can be useful. A good example is a paper by Erdi, dealing with a 
unity-gain buffer with a slew rate of 300 V/μs [1]. Another highly informative discourse is by 
Barry Hilton, [2] which also deals with a unity-gain buffer. 
 A little caution is required when a discrete stage may be driving not another of its own kind 
on the same supply rail, but opamp-based circuitry that is likely to be running off no more 
than ±18 V, as peak signal levels may drive the opamp inputs outside their rail voltages and 
cause damage. This normally only applies to discrete output stages but should be kept in 
mind whenever the supply rail is higher than 36 V for single rail and ±18 V for dual rail. 
 Bipolars and FETs 
 This chapter only deals with bipolar transistors. Their high transconductance and predictable 
operation make them far more versatile than FETs. The highly-variable V g of a FET can be 
dealt with by expedients such as current-source biasing, but the low gain, which means low 
feedback and poor linearity, remains a problem. FETs have their uses when super-high input 
impedances are required, and an example of a JFET working with an opamp that provides 
loop gain can be found in  Chapter 17 on microphone amplifiers. 
 Bipolar junction transistors 
 There is one thing to get straight first: 
 The bipolar junction transistor is a voltage-operated device. 
 What counts is the base-emitter voltage, or V be . Certainly a BJT needs base current to flow 
for it to operate, but this is really an annoying imperfection rather than the basis of operation. 
I appreciate this may take some digesting; far too many discussions of transistor action say 

Designing with discrete transistors 79
something like ‘a small current flowing into the base controls a much larger current flowing 
into the collector’. In fact the only truly current-operated amplifying device that comes to 
mind is the Hall-effect multiplier, and you don’t come across those every day. I’ve certainly 
never seen one used in audio- could be a market niche there. 
 Transistor operation is thus: if the base is open-circuit, then no collector current flows, as the 
collector-base junction is effectively a reverse-biased diode, as seen in  Figure 3.1 . There is a 
little leakage through from the collector to the emitter, but with modern silicon BJTs you can 
usually ignore it. 
 When the base is forward biased by taking it about 600 mV above the emitter, charge carriers 
are launched into the base region. Since the base region is narrow, the vast majority shoot 
through into the collector, to form the collector current  I c . Only a small proportion of these 
carriers are snared in the base and become the base current  I b , which is clearly a result and 
not the cause of the base-emitter voltage.  I b is normally just a nuisance.  
 The transistor equation 
 Every bipolar transistor obeys the Ebers-Moll transistor equation shown in  Figure 3.1 with 
startling accuracy over nine or ten decades of I c , which is a pretty broad hint that we are 
looking at the fundamental mechanism. In contrast, beta varies with I c , temperature, and 
just about everything else you can think of. The collector current is to a first approximation 
 Figure 3.1: Current ﬂ ow through a bipolar transistor, and the fundamental transistor equation 

80 Chapter 3
independent of collector voltage – in other words it is a current-source output. The 
qualifications to this are: 
1.  This only holds for V ce above, say, 2 volts. 
2.  It is not a perfect current-source; even with a high V ce , I c increases slowly with V ce . 
This is called the Early Effect, after Jim Early, [3] and has nothing to do with timing or 
punctuality. It is a major consideration in the design of stages with high voltage gain. The 
same effect when the transistor is operated in reverse mode – a perversion that will not 
concern us here – has sometimes been called the Late Effect. Ho-ho. 
 Beta 
 Beta (or h fe ) is the ratio of the base current I b to the collector current I c . It is not a 
fundamental property of a BJT. Never design circuits that depend on beta, unless of course 
you’re making a transistor tester. 
 Here are some of the factors that affect beta. This should convince you that it is a shifty and 
thoroughly untrustworthy parameter: 
 •  Beta varies with I c . First it rises as I c increases, reaching a broad peak, then it falls off 
as I c continues to increase. 
 •  Beta increases with temperature. This seems to be relatively little known. Most 
things, like leakage currents, get worse as temperature increases, so this makes a nice 
change. 
 •  Beta is lower for high-current transistor types. 
 •  Beta is lower for high V ceo transistor types. This is a major consideration when you are 
designing the small-signal stages of power amplifiers with high supply rails. 
 •  Beta varies widely between nominally identical examples of the same transistor type. 
 A very good refutation of the beta-centric view of BJTs is given by Barrie Gilbert in [4]. 
 Unity-gain buffer stages 
 A buffer stage is used to isolate two portions of circuitry from each other. It has a high input 
impedance and low output impedance; typically it prevents things downstream from loading 
things upstream. The use of the word ‘buffer’ normally implies ‘unity-gain buffer’ because 
otherwise we would be talking about an amplifier or gain stage. The gain with the simpler 
discrete implementations is in fact slightly less than one. The simplest discrete buffer 

Designing with discrete transistors 81
circuit-block is the one-transistor emitter-follower; it is less than ideal both in its mediocre 
linearity, and its asymmetrical load-driving capabilities. If we permit ourselves another 
transistor, the complementary feedback-pair (CFP) configuration gives better linearity. Both 
versions can have their load-driving performance much improved by replacing the emitter 
resistor with a constant-current source or a push-pull Class-A output arrangement. 
 If the CFP stage is not sufficiently linear, the next stage in sophistication is to combine 
an input differential pair with an output emitter-follower, using three transistors. This 
arrangement, often called the Schlotzaur configuration [5], can be elaborated until it gives 
a truly excellent distortion performance. Its load-driving capability can be enhanced in the 
same as the simpler configurations. 
 The simple emitter-follower 
 The simplest discrete circuit-block is the one transistor emitter-follower. This count of one 
does not include extra transistors used as current-sources, etc, to improve load-driving ability. 
It does not have a gain of exactly one, but it is usually pretty close. 
 Figure 3.2 shows a simple emitter-follower with a 2k7 emitter resistor Re, giving a quiescent 
current of 8.8 mA with ±24 V supply rails. Biasing is by a high-value resistor R1 connected 
to 0V. Note the polarity of the output capacitor; the output will sit at about 0.6 V due to 
the V be drop, plus a little lower due to the voltage drop caused by the base current I b flowing 
through R1. 
 Figure 3.2:  The simple emitter-follower circuit running from ±24 V supply rails 

82 Chapter 3
 The input impedance is approximately that of the emitter resistor in parallel with an external 
loading on the stage multiplied by the transistor beta: 
 
 R in   β  (R e  i R load ) 
( Equation 3.1 )
 Don’t  expect the output impedance to be as low as a opamp with plenty of NFB. The output 
impedance is approximately that of the source resistance divided by beta: 
 
 R out  R s ( β  ) 
( Equation 3.2 )
 The gain of an emitter-follower is always slightly less than unity, because of the finite 
transconductance of the transistor. Essentially the intrinsic emitter resistance r e (not to be 
confused with the physical component Re) forms a potential divider with the output load. It 
is simple to work out the small-signal gain at a given operating point. The value of r e  is given 
by 25/I c (for I c in mA) Since the value of r e is inversely proportional to I c , it varies with large 
signals, and it is one cause of the rather imperfect linearity of the simple emitter-follower. 
Heavier external loading increases the modulation of I c , increases the gain variation, and so 
increases distortion. 
   Figure 3.2   shows the emitter-follower with an AC-coupled load. Its load driving capability 
is not very good. While the transistor can, within limits, source as much current as required 
into the load, the current-sinking ability is limited by the emitter resistor Re, which forms a 
potential divider with the load resistance R load . With the values shown here, negative clipping 
occurs at about 10 V severely limiting the maximum output amplitude. The circuit shows a 
high-voltage low-beta transistor type running from ±24 V rails, to give worst-case performance 
results and to exploit the ability of discrete circuitry to run from high-voltage rails.  
 The simple emitter-follower has several factors that affect its distortion performance: 
 •  Distortion is reduced as the emitter resistor is reduced, for a given load impedance. 
 •  Distortion is reduced as the DC bias level is raised above the mid-point. 
 •  Distortion increases as the load impedance is reduced. 
 •  Distortion increases monotonically with output level. 
 •  Distortion does NOT vary with the beta of the transistor. This statement assumes low-
impedance drive, which may not be the case for an emitter-follower used as a buffer. If 
the source impedance is significant then beta is likely to have a complicated effect on 
linearity  and not always for the worse. 
 Emitter-follower distortion is mainly second harmonic, except when closely approaching 
clipping. This is entirely predictable, as the circuit is asymmetrical. Only symmetrical 

Designing with discrete transistors 83
configurations, such as the differential pair, restrict themselves to generating odd harmonics 
only, and then only when they are carefully balanced [6]. Symmetry is often praised as 
desirable in an audio circuit, but this is subject to Gershwin’s Law: ‘it ain’t necessarily so’. 
Linearity is what we want in a circuit, and symmetry is not necessarily the best way to get it.  
 Because the distortion is mostly second harmonic, its level is proportional to amplitude, as seen 
in  Figure 3.3 . At 2 Vrms with no load it is about 0.006%, rising to 0.013% at 4 Vrms. External 
loading always makes the distortion worse, and more rapid as the amplitude approaches the 
clipping point; the THD is more than doubled from 0.021% to 0.050% at 6 Vrms, just by adding 
a light 6k8 load. For these tests Re was 2k7, as in  Figure 3.2 . For both the EF and CFP circuits, 
distortion is flat across the audio band so no THD/frequency plots are given.  
 Insight into what’s happening can be gained by using SPICE to plot the incremental gain over 
the output swing, as in  Figure 3.4 . As loading increases the curvature of the gain characteristic 
becomes greater for a given voltage swing. It is obvious that the circuit is much more linear 
on the positive side of 0 V explaining why emitter-followers give less distortion when biased 
above the mid-point. This trick can be very useful if the full output swing is not required. 
 Most amplifier stages are biased so the quiescent output voltage is at the mid-point of the 
operating region, to allow the maximum symmetrical voltage swing. However, the asymmetry of 
the simple emitter-follower’s output current-capability means that if there is significant loading, a 
greater symmetrical output swing is often possible if the stage is biased positive of 0 V. 
 Figure 3.3 : How various external loads degrade the linearity of the simple emitter-follower. 
Re  2k7 

84 Chapter 3
 If the output is loaded with 2k2, negative clipping occurs at 8 V, which allows a maximum 
output amplitude of only 5.6 Vrms. The unloaded output capability is about 12 Vrms. If the 
bias point is raised from 0 V to 5 V the output capability becomes roughly symmetrical 
and the maximum loaded output amplitude is increased to 9.2 Vrms. Don’t forget to turn the 
output capacitor around. 
 The measured noise output of this stage with a 40 Ω source resistance is a commendably 
low 122.7 dBu (22 Hz–22 kHz) but with a base-stopper resistor (see below) of 1 kΩ this 
degrades to 116.9 dBu. A higher stopper of 2k7 gives 110.4 dBu. 
 The constant-current emitter-follower 
 The simple emitter-follower can be greatly improved by replacing the sink resistor Re with a 
constant-current source, as shown in  Figure 3.5 . The voltage across a current-source does not 
(to a good approximation) affect the current through it, so if the sink current is large enough a 
load can be driven to the full voltage swing in both directions.  
 The current source Q2 is biased by D1, D2. One diode cancels the V be drop of Q2, while 
the other sets up 0.6 V across the 100 Ω resistor R2, establishing the quiescent current at 
6 mA. The 22 kΩ resistor R3 in turn biases the diodes. This simple bias system works quite 
adequately if the supply rails are regulated, but might require filtering if they are not. The 
22 kΩ value is non-critical; so long as the diode current exceeds the I b of Q2 by a reasonable 
factor (say ten times) there will be no problem.

Quiescent current 6 mA. Note scale change compared with Figure 3.3 
 Figure 3.6 shows that distortion is much reduced. With no external load, the 0.013% of the 
simple emitter-follower (at 4Vrms) has become less than 0.0003%, the measurement system 
noise floor. This is because the amount by which the Q1 collector current is modulated is 
very much less. The linearity of this emitter-follower is still degraded by increasing loading, 

86 Chapter 3
but to a much lesser extent; with a significant external load of 4k7, the 0.036% of the simple 
emitter-follower (at 4Vrms) becomes 0.006%. The steps in the bottom (no load) trace are 
artefacts of the AP SYS-2702 measuring system.  
 The noise performance of this stage is exactly as for the simple emitter-follower above. 
 The push-pull emitter-follower 
 This is an extremely useful and trouble-free form of push-pull output; I have used it many 
times in preamplifiers, mixers, etc. I derived the notion from the valve-technology White 
cathode-follower, described by Nelson-Jones in a long-ago  Wireless World [7]. The original 
reference is a British Patent taken out by Eric White in 1940 [8].  
 Figure 3.7 shows a push-pull emitter-follower. When the output is sourcing current, there 
is a voltage drop through the upper sensing resistor R5, so its lower end goes downwards 
in voltage. This is coupled to the current-source Q2 through C3, and tends to turn it off. 
Likewise, when the current through Q1 falls, Q2 is turned on more. This is essentially a 
negative-feedback loop with an open-loop gain of unity, and so by simple arithmetic the 
current variations in Q1, Q2 are halved, and this stage can sink twice the current of the 
constant-current version described above, while running at the same quiescent current. 
 Figure 3.7 : Circuit of push-pull emitter-follower. Quiescent current still 6 mA as before, but the 
load-driving capability is twice as great 

Designing with discrete transistors 87
The effect of loading on linearity is once again considerably reduced, and only one resistor 
and one capacitor have been added. 
 This configuration needs fairly clean supply rails to work, as any upper-rail ripple or 
disturbance is passed directly through C3 to the current-source, modulating the quiescent 
current and disrupting the operation of the circuit.  
 Push-pull action further improves the linearity of load driving; the THD with a 4k7 external 
load is halved from 0.006% for the constant-current version (4 Vrms) to 0.003%, at the same 
quiescent current of 6 mA, as seen in  Figure 3.8 . This is pretty good linearity for such simple 
circuitry. 
 Emitter-follower stability 
 The emitter-follower is about as simple as an amplifier gets, and it seems highly unlikely 
that it could suffer from obscure stability problems. However, it can, and often does. Emitter-
followers are liable to RF oscillation when fed from an inductive source impedances. This 
oscillation is in the VHF region, usually in the area 100–400 MHz and will be quite invisible 
on the average oscilloscope; however a sure sign of this problem is unusually high distortion 
that varies strongly when the transistor is touched with a probing finger. One way to stop this 
is to put a ‘base-stopper’ resistor directly in series with the base. This should come after the 
bias resistor to prevent loss of gain. Depending on the circuit conditions, the resistor may be

to 2k2. Quiescent current 6 mA 

88 Chapter 3
as low as 100 Ω or as high as 2k7. The latter generates 119.6 dBu of Johnson noise which 
in itself is inconvenient in low-noise circuitry, but the effects of the transistor noise current 
flowing through it are likely to be even worse. Base-stopper resistors are not shown in the 
following diagrams to aid clarity but you should always be aware of the possible need for 
them. This also applies to the CFP configuration which is equally, if not more, susceptible to 
the problem. 
 The instability is due to the fact that the typical emitter-follower is fed from a source with 
some inductance, and has some capacitive loading, even if it is only due to stray capacitance, 
as in  Figure 3.9 a, where the transistor internal base-emitter capacitance C be is included. If this 
is redrawn as in  Figure 3.9 b, it is the classic circuit of a Colpitts oscillator.  
 For more information on this phenomenon see Feucht [9] and de Lange [10]. 
 CFP emitter-followers 
 The simple emitter-follower is lacking both in linearity and load-driving ability. 
The first shortcoming can be addressed by adding a second transistor to increase the 
negative feedback factor by increasing the open-loop-gain. This also allows the stage 
to be configured to give voltage gain, as the output and feedback point are no longer 
inherently the same. This arrangement is usually called the ‘complementary feedback pair’ 
(hereafter CFP) though it is sometimes known as the Szilaki configuration. This circuit 
can be modified for constant-current or push-pull operation exactly as for the simple 
emitter-follower.  
 Figure 3.10 shows an example. The emitter resistor Re is the same value as in the simple 
emitter-follower to allow meaningful comparisons. The value of R4 is crucial to good 
linearity, as it sets the  I c of the first transistor, and determines its collector loading. The value 
of 3k3 shown here is a good compromise. 
 This circuit is also susceptible to emitter-follower oscillation, particularly if it sees 
some load capacitance, and will probably need a base-stopper. If 1 kΩ does not do

 If we replace Re with a 6 mA current-source, as in  Figure 3.13 , we once more get improved 
linearity and load-driving capability, as shown in  Figure 3.14 . The 6 Vrms, 6k8 THD is 
now only just above the noise at 0.0005% (yes, three zeros after the point. Three-transistor 
circuitry can be rather effective).  
 Converting the constant-current CFP to push-pull operation as in  Figure 3.15 gives another 
improvement in linearity and load driving.  Figure 3.16 shows that now only the results for 
2k2 and 3k9 loading are above the measurement floor.  
 Improved unity-gain buffers 
 There is often a need for a unity-gain buffer with very low distortion. If neither the simple 
emitter-follower, made with one transistor, nor the CFP configuration with two transistors 
are adequately linear, we might ponder the advantages of adding a third transistor to improve 
performance, without going to the complexity of the discrete opamps described later in this 
chapter (in our transistor count we are ignoring current-sources used to create the active 
output loads that so improve linearity into significant external loading). 
 One promising next step is a three-transistor configuration that is often called the Schlotzaur 
configuration; see Feucht [5] and Staric and Margan [11]. The single input transistor in the

driving capability for no increase in standing current 

Designing with discrete transistors 93
CFP emitter-follower is now replaced with a long-tail-pair with 100% feedback to Q2, as in 
 Figure 3.17 a. Because LTPs have the property of cancelling out their even-order distortion, 
[6] you might expect a considerable improvement. You would be wrong – running on ±15 V 
rails we get 0.014% at 6 Vrms unloaded, almost flat across the audio band. The linearity is 
much inferior to the CFP emitter-follower. The open-loop gain, determined by measuring the 
error voltage between Q1, Q2 bases, is 249 times.  
 It’s not a promising start, but we will persist! Replace the collector load R2 with a current-
source of half the value of the tail current-source as in  Figure 3.17 b, and the linearity is 
transformed, yielding 0.00075% at 6 Vrms unloaded on ±15 V rails. Increasing the rails to 
±18 V gives 0.00066% at 6 Vrms, and a further increase to ±24 V as high-voltage operation 
is part of what discrete design is all about, gives 0.00042% at 6 Vrms (unloaded). It’s 
the increase in the positive rail that gives the improvement. Reducing the measurement

bandwidth from 80 kHz to 22 kHz for a 1 kHz signal eliminates some noise and gives a truer 
figure of 0.00032% at 6 Vrms. The open-loop gain is increased to 3400 times. 
 Adding loading to the buffer actually has very little effect on the linearity, but its output 
capability is clearly limited by the use of R3 to sink current, just as for a simple emitter-
follower. Replacing R3 with a 6 mA constant-current source, as for previous circuits, much 
improves drive capability and also improves linearity somewhat. See Figure 3.17c. On ±30 V 
rails we get a reading of 0.00019% at 5 Vrms with a 2k2 load, and that is mostly the noise in 
a 22 kHz bandwidth.  
 Finally we remove current-source I2 and replace it with a simple current-mirror in the input 
pair collectors, as in Figure 3.17d, in the pious hope that the open-loop gain will be doubled 
and distortion halved; On ±30 V rails there is a drop in THD from 0.00019% to 0.00017% at 
5 Vrms with a 2k2 load, (22 kHz bandwidth) but that is almost all noise and I am pushing the 
limits of even the magnificent Audio Precision SYS-2702. This goes to show that there are 
other ways of designing low-distortion circuitry apart from hefting a bucket of opamps. 
 Figure 3.18 shows the distortion plot at 5 Vrms. Using an 80 kHz bandwidth so the HF end 
is meaningful means the readings are higher, and virtually all noise below 10 kHz. It also 
gives another illustration of the distortion generated by under-sized coupling capacitors. 
C1 started as 22 μF, but you can see that 220 μF is required to eliminate distortion at 10 Hz 
with a 2k2 load. 
 SPICE analysis shows that the collector currents of the input pair Q1, Q2 are somewhat 
unbalanced by the familiar base-current errors of a simple current-mirror. Replacing the

simple current-mirror with the well-known Wilson improved mirror might get us further 
improvement, if we could measure it. Work in progress . . . 
 The circuit we have now could still be regarded as a much-enhanced emitter-follower, but it 
is probably more realistic to consider it as a two-stage discrete opamp. 
 Gain stages 
 This section covers any discrete transistor stage that can give voltage gain. It may be as simple 
as a single transistor or as complex as an opamp implemented with discrete components. A 
single transistor can give voltage gain in either series or shunt mode. 
 One-transistor shunt-feedback gain stages 
 Single-transistor shunt-feedback gain stages are inherently inverting, and of very poor 
linearity by modern standards. The circuit in  Figure 3.19 is inevitably a collection of 
compromises. The collector resistor R4 should be high in value to maximise the open- 
loop gain; but this reduces the collector current of Q1, and thus its transconductance, and 
hence reduces open-loop gain once more. The collector resistor must also be reasonably 
low in value as the collector must drive external loads directly. Resistor R2, in conjunction 
with R3, sets the operating conditions. This stage has only a modest amount of shunt 
feedback via R3, and the input can hardly be called a virtual earth. However such circuits 
were once very common in low-end discrete preamplifiers, back in the days when the cost 
of an active device was a serious matter. Such stages are still occasionally found doing 
humble jobs like driving VU meters, but the cost advantage over a opamp section is small, 
if it exists at all.  
 Figure 3.19: Circuit of single-transistor gain stage, shunt-feedback version. 24 V rail 

96 Chapter 3
 The gain of the stage in  Figure 3.19 is, at a first look, 220k/68k  3.23 times, but the 
actual gain is 2.3x (with no load) due to the small amount of open-loop gain available. The 
mediocre distortion performance that must be expected even with this low gain is shown in 
 Figure 3.20 .  
 One-transistor series-feedback gain stages 
 Single-transistor series-feedback gain stages are made by creating a common-emitter 
amplifier with a feedback resistor that gives series voltage feedback to the emitter. The gain 
is the ratio of the collector and emitter resistors, if loading is negligible. Note that unlike 
opamp-based series-feedback stages, this one is inherently inverting. To make a non-inverting 
stage with a gain more than unity requires at least two transistors, because of the inversion in 
a single common-emitter stage. 
 This very simple stage shown in  Figure 3.21 naturally has disadvantages. The output 
impedance is high, being essentially the value of the collector resistor R3. The output is 
neither good at sinking or sourcing current. 
 The distortion performance as seen in  Figure 3.22 is indifferent, giving 0.3% THD at 1 Vrms 
out. Compare this with the shunt-feedback one-transistor gain stage above, which gives 
0.07% under similar conditions.

transistors, as in  Figure 3.23 . The voltage gain is generated by Q1, which has a much 
higher collector resistor R4 and so much higher gain. This is possible because Q2 buffers 
it from external loading, and allows a higher NFB factor. See  Figure 3.24 for the distortion 
performance.

 With the addition of bootstrapping, as shown in  Figure 3.25 , the two-transistor stage has its 
performance transformed.  Figure 3.26 above shows how THD is reduced by a factor of ten; 
0.15% at 1 Vrms in, 3 Vrms out becomes 0.015%, which is much more respectable. The 
improvement is due to the increased voltage-gain of the first stage giving a higher NFB

factor. THD is still approximately proportional to level, as the distortion products are mainly 
second harmonic. Clipping occurs abruptly at 2.9 Vrms in, 8.7 Vrms out; abrupt clipping 
onset is characteristic of stages with a high NFB factor. Stages like this were commonly 
used as virtual-earth summing amplifiers in mixing consoles before acceptable opamps were 
available at reasonable cost.  
 Figure 3.27 shows that the distortion is further reduced to 0.002% at 3 Vrms out if the 
impedance of the input and feedback networks is reduced by ten times. SPICE simulation 
confirms that this is because the signal currents flowing in R1 and R5 are now larger 
compared with the non-linear currents drawn by the base of Q1. There is also a noise 
advantage.  
 Figure 3.28 shows how output drive capability can be increased, as before, by replacing R6 
with a 6 mA current-source. The input and feedback resistors R1, R5 have again been scaled 
down by a factor of 10. Push-pull operation can also be simply implemented as before. The 
EIN of this version is 116 dBu. 
 The constant-current and push-pull options can also be added to more complex discrete 
stages. Some good examples can be found in a preamplifier design of mine [12].

 Two-transistor shunt-feedback stages: improving linearity 
 As is usual with discrete configurations, the quickest way to improve linearity is to crank 
up the supply voltage, if that is feasible. This obviously increases the power consumed by 
the circuitry, but this is not normally a major issue.  Figure 3.29 shows the powerful affect of 
increasing the rail voltage on both the LF and HF distortion regimes. It is interesting to note 
that this simple configuration shows HF distortion (mainly second harmonic) increasing at 
6 dB/octave with frequency, despite the simplicity of the circuit and the apparent absence of 
compensation capacitance. Open-loop gain does fall off at HF due to the internal C bc of Q1, 
but the major source of HF distortion is the non-linear nature of this C bc  which varies strongly 
in capacitance with the voltage across it. There is more on this vital point in the later section 
on discrete opamps.  
 Table 3.1 summarises how the distortion at 1 kHz drops quickly at first, as the supply voltage is 
increased, but the improvement slows down at higher voltages. The input was 1 Vrms and the 
output 3.23 Vrms. These measurements were all taken with the emitter-resistor R6 at 2k7, as 
shown in  Figure 3.35 . R1 was 6k8 and R5 was 22 kΩ, as for  Figure 3.27 and in  Figure 3.28 above.

 Figure 3.29 : Distortion performance of two-transistor bootstrapped shunt-feedback stage, with 
varying supply voltage. Output  3.23 Vrms 
 In this configuration there are two stages, both of which have a certain curvature to their in/
out characteristics. With discrete design you have complete control over both of them, and 
there is always the possibility that you might be able to reduce distortion by altering the 
curvatures so that some degree of cancellation occurs in the distortion produced by each 
stage. This will be most effective on second-harmonic distortion. 
 A convenient way to alter the curvature of the second stage is to vary the value of the emitter 
resistor R6 in  Figure 3.25 . The results of doing this are shown in  Table 3.2 ; the input level 

Designing with discrete transistors 103
was 1 Vrms and the output level 3.23 Vrms. The measurements in this table were all taken 
with R6 set to 2k7, as shown in  Figure 3.25 .   
 The second row shows the standard results, as obtained from  Figure 3.25 with R6 set to 
2k7. Our first experiment is to raise its value to 3k3, but this is clearly a step in the wrong 
direction as THD increases from 0.00435% to 0.00466%. We therefore try reducing R6 to 
2k2, and get an immediate improvement to 0.00378%. Pressing on further, we reduce R6 
to 2k0, and THD falls again, but this time by a smaller amount, giving 0.00360%. It looks 
as if further decreases will yield diminishing benefits, and the increased standing-current 
in the emitter-follower may have serious consequences for power dissipation at higher 
supply voltages. Looking at the first four rows of the table, it is clear we get a useful 
increase in distortion performance simply by changing one component value, for no extra 
cost at all. 
 Since it appears we have gone about as far as we can in tweaking the output emitter-follower, 
we can consider a more radical step. As a general rule, any emitter-follower in a discrete 
transistor configuration can be inverted- in other words replaced by its complementary 
equivalent. This can be very useful when attempting to cancel the distortion from different 
stages, as just described. The result of this move is shown in  Figure 3.30 , where the output 
emitter follower Q2 is now a PNP device.  
 Unfortunately, we discover when we do the measurements that we have royally messed up 
an existing distortion cancellation rather than improved it, as shown in  Table 3.3 (the ‘THD 
ratio’ is based on the original configuration; the second row of  Table 3.2 is the reference). 
The distortion with a 24 V supply rail is almost doubled, and clearly we are reinforcing the 
curvature of the two stages rather than partially cancelling it. Increasing the supply voltage 
still improves the linearity, as it almost always will.

 We can again attempt to improve the linearity by modifying the value of the output emitter 
resistor R6, but it really doesn’t help very much. The deeply unimpressive results are seen in 
 Table 3.4 . The ‘THD ratio’ reference is again the second row of  Table 3.2 .

 Clearly in this case the conventional configuration with two NPN transistors is the superior one. 
It was and is the most common version encountered, so sometimes conventional is optimal. 
 Two-transistor shunt-feedback stages: noise 
 The noise output of the shunt-feedback circuit in   Figure 3.28   with R1  6k8 and R5  22 kΩ 
is 99.5 dBu. To work out the equivalent input noise (EIN) we need to know the actual noise 
gain at which the circuit works, not the closed-loop gain. The latter is simply (R5/R1) but the 
apparent noise gain is higher at (R5/R1) 1, which evaluates as 12.5 dB, as it would be for 
the equivalent opamp circuit. The noise gain is actually rather higher, because we must allow 
for the presence of the biasing resistor R2. This raises the true noise gain to 16.2 dBu. In 
the typical application for this kind of circuit, that of virtual-earth summing amp, there would 
have been many input resistances R1, and the presence of R2 would have made relatively 
little difference to the overall noise performance. 
 Armed with the true noise gain, we can work out the EIN as 115.7 dBu, which is basically the 
noise performance of the first stage, as it implements all the voltage gain. It has to be said that I 
have so far made no attempt to optimise the noise performance of the circuit shown here. Increasing 
the first-stage collector current would probably reduce the noise with the feedback values shown. 
 Two-transistor shunt-feedback stages: bootstrapping 
 Choosing the right size for a bootstrap capacitor is not quite as straightforward as it appears. 
It looks as if quite a small value could be used because of the high impedance of the Q1 
collector load. In  Figures 3.25 and  3.28 , the bootstrap capacitor C4 effectively sees only the 
47 kΩ impedance of R8 to the supply rail, and a 2μ2 capacitor in conjunction with this gives 
3 dB frequency of 1.54 Hz, which looks ample. 
 But it is not.  Figure 3.31 shows that this value gives an enormous rise in LF distortion, 
reaching 0.020% at 10 Hz. The reason for this steep rise is that bootstrapping as a means 
of gain enhancement requires the bootstrapped point to  accurately follow the output of the 
voltage stage, because even small deviations from unity-gain in the bootstrapping mean that 
the increase in Q1 collector impedance, and hence the overall open-loop gain, is seriously 
compromised. Note that there is no requirement for R4 and R8 to be the same value, but their 
sum, in conjunction with the voltage conditions, will define Q1 collector current.   Figure 3.31 
also shows that a 47 μF bootstrap capacitor is big enough to keep the distortion flat down to 
10 Hz, and going to 100 μF gives no further improvement.  
 We saw earlier that inverting the output emitter-follower made the distortion worse rather 
than better. There is, however, an interesting consequence of that inversion. We can now use 
what might be called DC-bootstrapping, because no capacitor is used. The collector load of 
Q1 is a single resistor R4, and it is now connected between the base and emitter of the output 
emitter-follower Q2, as shown in  Figure 3.32 .  

 Figure 3.31:  The 2µ2 trace shows the effect of using too small a bootstrap capacitor. Output 
3 Vrms, no external load

and DC-bootstrapping of the Q1 load R4 

Designing with discrete transistors 107
 This technique eliminates the bootstrap capacitor and its potential problems, but 
unfortunately is less linear. The distortion performance is summarised in  Table 3.5 , where 
once more, the ‘THD ratio’ is based on the second row of  Table 3.2 as the reference.   
 This configuration has better linearity than the inverted emitter-follower with capacitive 
bootstrapping, but it is still markedly worse than the original version of Figure 3.25. As  Table 3.5  
shows, tweaking R6 doesn’t help much. We can also try changing the value of the Q1 collector load 
R4, as it determines the Q1 collector current, and is likely to have an important effect on circuit 
operation, but as the last two rows of  Table 3.5 demonstrate, sadly we find that either increasing 
or decreasing it from 6k8 makes things a lot worse. 
 We have however saved two components – in particular an electrolytic capacitor has been 
eliminated, and these are the least reliable parts in the long-term, due to their tendency to dry 
out and drop in value. 
 Two-transistor shunt-feedback stages as summing ampliﬁ ers 
 Two-transistor shunt-feedback stages like those described above were used as virtual-earth 
summing amplifiers in mixers for many years. They were still in use in the early 1980s 
in mixer designs that were all-discrete to avoid the compromises in noise and distortion 
that came with the (affordable) opamps of the day. A two-transistor summing amplifier is 
simply the design of  Figure 3.25 , with a 22 kΩ feedback resistor, the 6k8 input resistor 
representing a summing resistor from a mixer channel. The junction of the two was the 
virtual-earth bus. 
 We have seen that the distortion of the two-transistor configuration is not stunning by modern 
standards, though it can be improved. Another important parameter for a summing amplifier 
is the level of the bus residual, which is the signal voltage actually existing on the virtual-
earth bus. Ideally this would be zero, but in the real world it is non-zero because the summing 
amplifier has a finite open-loop gain. In simpler mixers this can have serious effects on inter-
bus crosstalk; this is discussed in more detail in  Chapter 22 .

   Figure 3.33   shows the bus residual, relative to the summing amplifier output voltage, for three 
versions of the two-transistor configuration. With no bootstrapping, as in  Figure 3.23 , the bus 
residual is an unimpressive 52 dB. Adding conventional capacitor bootstrapping to increase 
the open-loop gain gives a much lower 66 dB, and DC-bootstrapping, as described in the 
previous section, gives us 64 dB, indicating it is slightly less effective at raising the open-
loop gain. These two traces show a rise at the HF end which does not appear on the 52 dB 
trace; this is almost certainly due to the open-loop gain falling off at HF due to the C bc of 
Q1. There is also a rise in bus residual at the LF end, looking the same for all three cases. I 
suspect increasing C2 would remove that.  
 Two-transistor series-feedback gain stages  
 The circuit in  Figure 3.34 clearly has a close family relationship with the CFP emitter-
follower, which is simply one of these stages configured for unity gain. The crucial 
difference here is that the output is separated from the input emitter, so the closed-loop 
gain is set by the R3-R2 divider ratio. 
 Only limited NFB is available, so closed-loop gains of two or three times are usually 
the limit.

  It is less easy to adapt this circuit to improve load-driving capability, because the feedback 
resistive divider must be retained.  Figure 3.35 shows that distortion performance depends 
strongly on the value of R4, the collector load for Q1. The optimal value for linearity and 
noise performance is around 4k7.

110 Chapter 3
 Discrete opamp design 
 When the previously described circuits do not show enough linearity or precision for the job 
in hand, or a true differential input is required, it may be time to use an opamp made from 
discrete transistors. The DC precision will be much inferior to an IC opamp and the parts 
count high compared with the other discrete configurations we have looked at, but the noise 
and distortion performance can both be very good indeed. A good example of discrete opamp 
usage is a preamplifier I designed a while back, [13] though it must be said the opamps there 
could definitely be improved by following the suggestions in this section.  
 A typical, though non-optimal, discrete opamp is shown in  Figure 3.36 . The long-tail 
pair first stage Q2, Q3 subtracts the input and feedback voltages. It is a transconductance 
amplifier, i.e. it turns a differential voltage input into a current output, which flows into the second 
amplifier stage Q4, Q5. This is a transadmittance amplifier; current in becomes voltage 
out. Its input is at low impedance (a sort of virtual-earth) because of local NFB through 
dominant-pole capacitor C3, and so is well-adapted to accepting the output current from the 
first stage. The third stage is a Class-A emitter follower with current source, which isolates 
the second stage collector from external loads. The higher the quiescent current in this stage 
(here 6 mA as before) the lower the load impedance that can be driven symmetrically. The 
configuration is basically that of a power amplifier, with a simplified small-scale output 
 Figure 3.36: A typical discrete opamp circuit, with current-source output 

Designing with discrete transistors 111
stage; a very great deal more information than there is space for here can be found in my 
power amplifier book [14]. 
 The dominant-pole capacitor C3 is shown here as 15 pF, which is often large enough for 
stable small-signal operation. In a power amplifier it would probably be 100 pF because of 
the greater phase shifts in a full-scale output stage with power transistors. The closed-loop 
gain is here set to about 4 times (12.5 dB) by R5, R6. 
 The opamp in  Figure 3.36 can be much improved by addressing the major causes of 
distortion in the circuit. These are: 
 •  Input stage: The current/voltage gain (transconductance) curve of the input stage peaks 
broadly at the centre of its characteristic, where the collector currents of Q2, Q3 are 
equal, and this is its most linear area. The distortion is a relatively small amount of 
third-harmonic. If the input pair is operated away from this point there is a rapid rise 
in second-harmonic distortion, which quickly swamps the third harmonic. 
 •  Second stage: The transistor Q4 in conjunction with C3 converts current to voltage. 
It has the full output swing on its collector, and so I call it the VAS (voltage 
amplifier stage). It has an internal collector-base capacitance C bc which varies with 
the collector-base voltage, (V cb ) and so creates second-harmonic distortion at HF. 
Distortion at LF is at a much lower level and is due to Early effect in Q4. 
 •  Output stage: The distortion of the Class-A output stage is negligible compared with 
that of the first two stages, providing it is not excessively loaded. 
 Discrete opamp design: the input stage 
 If the input pair is operated away from its balanced condition, there is a rapid (12 dB/
octave) rise in second-harmonic THD with frequency due to the roll-off of open-loop gain 
by C3. As a result the value of R2 in  Figure 3.36 is crucial. Global NFB establishes the V be 
of Q4 (0.6 V) across R2, so it needs to be approximately half the value of R1, which has 
0.6 V across it to set the input stage tail current. The value of R3 has almost no effect on the 
collector-current balance but is chosen to equalise the power dissipation in the two input 
transistors and so reduce DC drift. The critical importance of the value of R2 is demonstrated 
in  Figure 3.37 , where even small errors in R2 greatly increase the distortion. The collector 
currents of Q2, Q3 need to be matched to about 1% for minimum distortion.  
 Figure 3.36 has a small Miller capacitance C3 of 15 pF, and the large amount of NFB 
consequently available means that simply optimising R2 gives results almost indistinguishable 
from the testgear residual of an Audio Precision System-1. The circuit with R2 corrected is 
shown in  Figure 3.38 . An additional unrelated improvement shown is the inversion of the 
output stage so the biasing diodes D1, D2 can be shared, and the component count reduced.

 The good linearity obtained with the simple design of  Figure 3.38 is only achieved because 
the closed-loop gain is moderate at four times, and the open-loop gain is high. In more 
demanding applications (including the front-end of power amplifiers) the closed-loop 
gain will be higher (often 23 times) and the open-loop gain lower due to a typical Miller 

Designing with discrete transistors 113
capacitance of 100 pF. This places much greater demands on the basic linearity of the circuit, 
and further improvements are valuable: 
 •  The tail current of the input pair Q2, Q3 is increased from 580 μA to 4 mA, 
increasing the transconductance of the two transistors by roughly eight times. The 
transconductance is then reduced back to its original value by inserting emitter 
degeneration resistors. Since the transconductance is now controlled much more by 
fixed resistors rather than the transistors, this greatly linearises the input stage. 
 •  The collector resistors are replaced with a current-mirror that forces the collector currents 
of the input pair Q2, Q3 into accurate equality. This is more dependable than optimising 
R2, and also doubles the open-loop gain as the collector currents of both input transistors 
are now put to use. 
 These two enhancements give us the circuit shown in  Figure 3.39 . The input pair emitter 
degeneration resistors are R2, R3, and the current-mirror is Q4, Q5, which is itself 
degenerated by R4, R5 for greater accuracy. The distortion performance is the upper trace

in  Figure 3.41 ; this looks pretty poor compared with the lower trace in  Figure 3.37 , but as 
explained above our discrete opamp is now working under much more demanding conditions 
of high closed-loop gain and low open-loop gain, much reducing the NFB factor. Thanks to 
our efforts on the first stage, the distortion seen is coming entirely from the second stage Q6, 
so we had better sort it out.  
 Discrete opamp design: the second stage 
 As noted above, the dominant cause of second-stage (VAS) distortion is the non-linear C bc of 
the VAS transistor, now labelled Q6. The local feedback around it is therefore non-linear and 
second-harmonic distortion is generated. A simple but extremely effective cure for this is to 
add an emitter-follower Q10, inside the local feedback loop of C3, giving us  Figure 3.40 . The 
non-linear local feedback through Q6, C bc , is now harmlessly absorbed by the low impedance 
at the emitter of Q10, and the linear component C3 alone controls the VAS behaviour. The 
result is the lower trace in  Figure 3.41 , which is indistinguishable from the output of the 
state-of-art Audio Precision SYS-2702. Similar results can be obtained by instead cascoding 
Q6, but more parts are required and the linearity is in general not quite so good.

the VAS. 20 dBu output, ±20 V rails 
 In both  Figures 3.39 and  3.40 the VAS current has been increased from 1.6 mA to 6 mA. 
This change has very little effect on the distortion performance, but much increases the 
positive slew-rate, marking it more nearly equal to the negative slew-rate. The transistors 
are all MPSA42/92 high-voltage low-beta types (with the exception of the current-mirror) 
to underline the fact that high-beta devices are not required for low distortion. Do not use 
MPSA42 in the current-mirror as it has an unusually high minimum V ce for proper operation.  
 Discrete opamp design: the output stage 
 Figure 3.41 shows there is no need to worry about output stage distortion with moderate 
loading, as it is very low with even moderate levels of NFB. If the loading is so heavy that 
linearity deteriorates, the options are to increase the output stage standing current or to adopt 
a push-pull emitter-follower output stage, as described earlier in this chapter. The push-pull 
method is more efficient and will give better linearity. 
 For still heavier loads, a Class-AB output stage employing two complementary small-signal 
transistors can be used. The operation of such a stage is rather different from that of a power 
amplifier output stage, with crossover distortion and critical biasing being less of a problem. 
See  Chapter 20 on headphone amplifiers for more on this. 

116 Chapter 3
 High input impedance bipolar stages 
 Bipolar transistors are commonly thought of as low-impedance devices, but in fact they can 
be used to create amplifiers with extremely high input impedances. FETs are of course the 
obvious choice for high input impedance amplifiers, but their lack of transconductance is a 
drawback. This section was inspired by an article by T. D. Towers in 1968 that is still well 
worth reading [15]. The circuits that follow deliberately use high-voltage low-beta transistors 
as higher than normal rails are one of the reasons for using discrete circuitry. ±24 V rails are 
used. The impedances given were measured and also checked with SPICE. 
 Figure 3.42a shows a simple emitter-follower biased by R bias , which at 100 kΩ is about as 
high as you would want it to be, because of the voltage drop due to the base current. That 
 Figure 3.42 : High-impedance input stages: a) Simple emitter-follower with bootstrapped biasing; 
500 kΩ, b) emitter-follower with current-source and bootstrap driver stage; 6.1 MΩ, c) Darlington 
with current-source and bootstrap driver stage; 21 MΩ, d) Darlington with current-source and Q1 
collector bootstrapped; 61 MΩ 

Designing with discrete transistors 117
limits the input impedance to 100 kΩ of course. The First Principle of high-impedance 
design is to bootstrap the bias resistor as in Figure 3.42a, which raises the input impedance 
to 500 kΩ. You may be wondering: why not more? One reason is that Q1 is only a simple 
emitter-follower and its voltage gain is distinctly less than one, limiting the efficacy of the 
bootstrapping. 
 The Second Principle of high-impedance design with simple discrete stages is that any 
loading on the output reduces the input impedance because, as noted earlier: 
 
 R in   β (R e  i R load ) 
( Equation 3.3 )
 and the bootstrap capacitor C2 is driving the load of R1 even if there is no external loading. 
Adding an external 10 kΩ R load to represent the following stage reduces the input impedance 
to 350 kΩ. 
 Having noted that both R e  and R load pull down the input impedance, we will take steps to 
increase their effective values. Figure 3.42b shows R e made very high by replacing the 
emitter resistor with a current source Q2. R load is made high by adding simple emitter-
follower Q3 to drive the bootstrap and the output. This gives a 6.1 MΩ input impedance 
even when driving an external 10 kΩ load output. 
 A further increase in input impedance can be obtained by increasing the β term in 
Equation 3.3, by using a Darlington configuration, where one emitter-follower feeds another, 
as in Figure 3.42c. Q1 must have a reasonable collector current to operate at a good β; more 
than the base current of Q2. An emitter resistor to the negative rail would increase the loading 
and defeat the object, so R4 is used, with its lower end bootstrapped from the emitter of Q2. 
This technique is also used in power amplifier circuitry [16]. This gives an input impedance 
of 21 MΩ with an external 10 kΩ load. The output is now taken from Q2 emitter once more.  
 To significantly further raise the input impedance, we need to take on board the Third Principle 
of high-impedance design; bootstrap the input transistor collector, as in Figure 3.42d. The 
collector resistance r c of Q1 and the base-collector capacitance c bc are both effectively in 
parallel with the input; the former can also be regarded as Early Effect causing  I b to vary. 
Their effects are reduced by bootstrapping Q1 collector using R6 and C3 (note that collector 
bootstrapping cannot be used with a single-transistor stage [17]). The emitter follower Q4 
also has its emitter resistor replaced by current source Q5 to make its gain nearer one for 
more effective bootstrapping and help with driving R1 and R6. The output point has also been 
shifted back to the second emitter-follower. The result is an input impedance of 60 MΩ, or 
50 MΩ with an external 10 kΩ load. 
 We have achieved this using only five transistors, so the BJT is clearly not an inherently low-
impedance device. There are many more technical possibilities if you need a really astronomical 
input impedance; the record in 1968 appears to have been no less than 20,000 MΩ [18]. 

118 Chapter 3
 The circuits in  Figure 3.42 are not optimised for linearity. They all give substantially more 
distortion when fed from a high source impedance such as 1 MΩ, as the base currents drawn 
are not linear.

 Opamps and their properties 
 Introduction 
 Audio design has for many years relied on a very small number of opamp types; the TL072 
and the 5532 dominated the audio small-signal scene for many years. The TL072, with 
its JFET inputs, was used wherever its negligible input bias currents and low cost were 
important. For a long time the 5534/5532 was much more expensive than the TL072, so the 
latter was used wherever feasible in an audio system, despite its inferior noise, distortion, and 
load-driving capabilities. The 5534 was reserved for critical parts of the circuitry. Although it 
took many years, the price of the 5534 is now down to the point where you need a very good 
reason to choose any other type of opamp for audio work. 
 The TL072 and the 5532 are dual opamps; the single equivalents are TL071 and 5534. Dual 
opamps are used almost universally, as the package containing two is usually cheaper than 
the package containing one, simply because it is more popular. 
 There are however other opamps, some of which can be useful, and a selected range is 
covered here. 
 A very brief history of opamps 
 The opamp is today thought of as quintessentially a differential amplifier, responding to the 
difference of the input voltages while (hopefully) ignoring any common-mode component. 
The history of differential amplifiers goes back to that great man Alan Blumlein, and his 
1936 patent [1] for a pair of valves with their cathodes connected to ground through a 
common resistor. However, the first valve-based operational amplifiers, i.e. those intended to 
be capable of performing a mathematical operation, were in fact not differential at all, having 
only one input. That had to be an inverting input, of course, so you could apply negative 
feedback. 
 The first opamp to get real exposure in the UK was the Fairchild uA709, designed 
by the great Bob Widlar and introduced in 1965. It was a rather awkward item which 
required quite complicated external compensation and was devoid of output short-circuit 

120 Chapter 4
protection. One slip of the probe and an expensive IC was gone. It was prone to latch-up 
with high common-mode voltages and did not like capacitive loads. I for one found all 
this most discouraging, and gave up on the 709 pretty quickly. If you're going to quit, do 
it early, I say. 
 The arrival of the LM741 was a considerable relief. To my mind, it was the first really 
practical opamp, and it was suddenly possible to build quite complex circuitry with a 
good chance of it being stable, doing what it should do, and not blowing up at the first 
shadow of an excuse. I have given some details of it in this chapter for purely historical 
reasons. There is also an interesting example of how to apply the LM741 appropriately 
in  Chapter 15 . 
 The first IC opamps opened up a huge new area of electronic applications, but after the 
initial enthusiasm for anything new, the audio market greeted these devices with less than 
enthusiasm. There were good reasons for this. The LM741 worked reliably; the snag with 
using it for audio was the leisurely slew rate of 0.5 V/μs, which made full output at 20 kHz 
impossible. For a period of at least five years, roughly from 1972 to 1977, the only way to 
obtain good performance in a preamp was to stick with discrete transistor Class-A circuitry, 
and this became recognised as a mark of high quality. The advent of the TL072 and the 5532 
changed this situation completely, but there is still sometimes marketing cachet to be gained 
from a discrete design. 
 An excellent and detailed history of operational amplifiers can be found in reference [2]. 
 Opamp properties: noise 
 There is no point in regurgitating manufacturer’s data sheets, especially since they are readily 
available on the internet. Here I have simply ranked the opamps most commonly used for 
audio in order of voltage noise ( Table 4.1 ) .
 The great divide is between JFET input opamps and BJT input opamps. The JFET 
opamps have more voltage noise but less current noise than bipolar input opamps, the 
TL072 being particularly noisy. If you want the lowest voltage noise, it has to be a 
bipolar input. The difference however between a modern JFET-input opamp such as 
the OPA2134 and the old faithful 5532 is only 4 dB; but the JFET part is a good deal 
more costly. The bipolar AD797 seems to be out on its own here, but it is a specialised 
and expensive part. The LT1028 is not suitable for audio use for reasons described in 
 Chapter 11 . The LM741 has no noise specs on its data sheets, and the 20nV/√Hz is from 
measurements. 

Opamps and their properties 121
 Both voltage and current noise increase at 6 dB/octave below the 1/ f corner frequency, which 
is usually around 100 Hz. The only way to minimise this effect is to choose an appropriate 
opamp type. 
 Opamps with bias cancellation circuitry are normally unsuitable for audio use due to the extra 
noise this creates. The amount depends on circuit impedances, and is not taken into account 
in  Table 4.1 . The general noise behaviour of opamps in circuits is dealt with in  Chapter 1 . 
 Opamp properties: slew rate 
 Slew rates vary more than most parameters; a range of 100:1 is shown here in  Table 4.2 . The 
slowest is the LM741, which is the only type not fast enough to give full output over the 
audio band. There are faster ways to handle a signal, such as current-feedback architectures, 
but they usually fall down on linearity. In any case, a maximum slew rate greatly in excess of 
what is required appears to confer no benefits whatever.

 The 5532 slew rate is typically ±9 V/μs. This version is internally compensated for unity-gain 
stability, not least because there are no spare pins for compensation when you put two 
opamps in an 8-pin dual package. The single-amp version, the 5534, can afford a couple of 
compensation pins, and so is made to be stable only for gains of 3 times or more. The basic 
slew rate is therefore higher at ±13 V/μs. 
 Compared with power-amplifier specs, which often quote 100 V/μs or more, these speeds may 
appear rather sluggish. In fact they are not; even ±9 V/μs is more than fast enough. Assume 
you are running your opamp from ±18 V rails, and that it can give a ±17 V swing on its output. 
For most opamps this is distinctly optimistic, but never mind. To produce a full-amplitude 
20 kHz sine wave you only need 2.1 V/μs, so even in the worst case there is a safety-margin 
of at least four times. Such signals do not of course occur in actual use, as opposed to testing. 
More information on slew-limiting is given in the section on opamp distortion. 
 Opamp properties: common mode range 
 This is simply the range over which the inputs can be expected to work as proper differential 
inputs. It usually covers most of the range between the rail voltages, with one notable 
exception. The data sheet for the TL072 shows a common-mode (CM) range that looks a bit 

Opamps and their properties 123
curtailed at 12 V. This bland figure hides the deadly trap this IC contains for the unwary. 
Most opamps, when they hit their CM limits, simply show some sort of clipping. The TL072, 
however, when it hits its negative limit, promptly inverts its phase, so your circuit either 
latches up, or shows nightmare clipping behaviour with the output bouncing between the 
two supply rails. The positive CM limit is in contrast trouble-free. This behaviour can be 
especially troublesome when TL072s are used in high-pass Sallen and Key filters. 
 Opamp properties: input offset voltage 
 A perfect opamp would have its output at 0 V when the two inputs were exactly at the same 
voltage. Real opamps are not perfect and a small voltage difference – usually a few milliVolts – 
is required to zero the output. These voltages are large enough to cause switches to click and 
pots to rustle, and DC blocking is often required to keep them in their place. 
 The typical offset voltage for the 5532A is ±0.5 mV typical, ±4 mV maximum at 25 °C; the 
5534A has the same typical spec but a lower maximum at ±2 mV. The input offset voltage of 
the new LM4562 is only ±0.1 mV typical, ±4 mV maximum at 25 °C. 
 Opamp properties: bias current 
 Bipolar input opamps not only have larger noise currents than their JFET equivalents, they 
also have much larger bias currents. These are the base currents taken by the input transistors. 
This current is much larger than the input offset current, which is the difference between the 
bias current for the two inputs. For example, the 5532A has a typical bias current of 200 nA, 
compared with a much smaller an input offset current of 10 nA. The LM4562 has a lower 
bias current of 10 nA typical, 72 nA maximum. In the case of the 5532/4 the bias current 
flows into the input pins as the input transistors are NPN. 
 Bias currents are a considerable nuisance, when they flow through variable resistors they 
make them noisy when moved. They will also cause significant DC offsets when they flow 
through high-value resistors. 
 It is often recommended that the effect of bias currents can be cancelled out by making the 
resistance seen by each opamp input equal.  Figure 4.1a shows a shunt-feedback stage with 
a 22 kΩ feedback resistor. When 200 nA flows through this it will generate a DC offset of 
4.4 mV, which is rather more than we would expect from the input offset voltage error. 
 If an extra resistance R compen , of the same value as the feedback resistor, is inserted into the 
non-inverting input circuit then the offset will be cancelled. This strategy works well and 
is done almost automatically by many designers. However, there is a snag. The resistance 
R compen generates extra Johnson noise, and to prevent this it is necessary to shunt the 

124 Chapter 4
resistance with a capacitor, as in  Figure 4.1b . This extra component costs money and takes 
up PCB space, so it is questionable if this technique is actually very useful for audio work. 
It is usually more economical to allow offsets to accumulate in a chain of opamps, and then 
remove the DC voltage with a single output blocking capacitor. This assumes that there are 
no stages with a large DC gain, and that the offsets are not large enough to significantly 
reduce the available voltage swing. Care must also be taken if controls are involved, because 
even a small DC voltage across a potentiometer will cause it to become crackly, especially as 
it wears.  
 FET input opamps have very low bias current at room temperature; however it doubles 
for every 10 degree Centigrade rise. This is pretty unlikely to cause trouble in most audio 
applications, but a combination of high internal temperatures and high-value pots could lead 
to some unexpected crackling noises. 
 Opamp properties: cost 
 While it may not appear on the datasheet, the price of an opamp is obviously a major factor 
in deciding whether or not to use it.  Table 4.3 was derived from the averaged prices for 1 
and 25 quantities across a number of UK distributors. In September 2009 (at the time of 
writing the First Edition) the cheapest popular opamps were the TL072 and the 5532, and 
these happened to come out at exactly the same price for 25, so their price is taken as unity 
and used as the basis for the price ratios given. 
 Table 4.3 was compiled using prices for DIL packaging and the cheapest variant of each 
type. Price is per package and not per opamp section. It is obviously only a rough guide. 
Purchasing in large quantities or in different countries may change the rankings somewhat 
(even going from 1 to 25 causes some changes) but the basic look of things will not alter 
too much. One thing is obvious – the 5532 is one of the great opamp bargains of all time.

resistor must be bypassed by a capacitor C2 to prevent it adding Johnson noise to the stage 

Opamps and their properties 125
 Opamp properties: distortion 
 Relatively few discussions of opamp behaviour deal with non-linear distortion, perhaps 
because it is a complex business. Opamp ‘accuracy’ is closely related, but the term is often 
applied only to DC operation. Accuracy here is often specified in terms of bits, so ‘20-bit 
accuracy’ means errors not exceeding one part in 2 to the 20, which is 120 dB or 0.0001%. 
Audio signal distortion is of course a dynamic phenomenon, very sensitive to frequency, and 
DC specs are of no use at all in estimating it.  
 Distortion is always expressed as a ratio, and can be quoted as a percentage, as number of 
decibels, or in parts per million. With the rise of digital processing, treating distortion as the 
quantization error arising from the use of a given number of bits has become more popular. 
 Figure 4.2 hopefully provides a way of keeping perspective when dealing with these different 
metrics.   There are several different causes of distortion in opamps. We will now examine them. 
 Opamp internal distortion 
 This is what might be called the basic distortion produced by the opamp you have selected. 
Even if you scrupulously avoid clipping, slew-limiting, and common-mode issues, opamps 
are not distortion free, though some types such as the 5532 and the LM4562 have very 
low levels. If distortion appears when the opamp is run with shunt feedback, to prevent

common-mode voltages on the inputs, and with very light output loading, then it is probably 
wholly internal and there is nothing to be done about it except pick a better opamp. 
 If the distortion is higher than expected, the cause may be internal instability provoked by 
putting a capacitative load directly on the output, or neglecting the supply decoupling. The 
classic example of the latter effect is the 5532, which shows high distortion if there is not a 
capacitor across the supply rails close to the package; 100 nF is usually adequate. No actual 
HF oscillation is visible on the output with a general-purpose oscilloscope, so the problem 
may be instability in one of the intermediate gain stages. 
 Slew rate limiting distortion 
 While this is essentially an overload condition, it is wholly the designer's responsibility. If 
users whack up the gain until the signal is within a hair of clipping, they should still be able 
to assume that slew-limiting will never occur, even with aggressive material full of high 
frequencies. 
 Arranging this is not too much of a problem. If the rails are set at the usual maximum 
voltage, i.e. ±18 V, then the maximum possible signal amplitude is 12.7 Vrms, ignoring the 
saturation voltages of the output stage. To reproduce this level cleanly at 20 kHz requires a 
minimum slew rate of only 2.3 V/μs. Most opamps can do much better than this, though with 
the OP27 (2.8 V/μs) you are sailing rather close to the wind. The old LM741 looks as though 
it would be quite unusable, as its very limited 0.5 V/μs slew rate allows a full output swing 
only up to 4.4 kHz. 
 Horrific as it may now appear, audio paths full of LM741s were quite common in the early 
1970s. Entire mixers were built with no other active devices, and what complaints there were 
tended to be about noise rather than distortion. The reason for this is that full-level signals at 
20 kHz simply do not occur in reality; the energy at the HF end of the audio spectrum is well-
known to be much lower than that at the bass end. 
 This assumes that slew-limiting has an abrupt onset as level increases, rather like clipping. 
This is in general the case. As the input frequency rises and an opamp gets closer to slew-
limiting, the input stage is working harder to supply the demands of the compensation 
capacitance. There is an absolute limit to the amount of current this stage can supply, and 
when you hit it the distortion shoots up, much as it does when you hit the supply rails and 
induce voltage clipping. Before you reach this point, the linearity may be degraded, but 
usually only slightly until you get close to the limit. It is not normally necessary to keep 
big margins of safety when dealing with slew-limiting. If you are employing the Usual 
Suspects in the audio opamp world – the TL072, the 5532 and the LM4562, with maximal 
slew rates of 13, 9 and 20 V/μs respectively, you are most unlikely to suffer any slew rate 
non-linearity. 

128 Chapter 4
 Distortion due to loading 
 Output stage distortion is always worse with heavy output loading because the increased 
currents flowing exacerbate the gain changes in the Class-B output stage. These output stages 
are not individually trimmed for optimal quiescent conditions (as are audio power amplifiers) 
and so the crossover distortion produced by opamps tends to be both higher and can be more 
variable between different specimens of the same chip. Distortion increases with loading 
in different ways for different opamps. It may rise only at the high-frequency end, (e.g. the 
OP2277) or there may be a general rise at all frequencies. Often both effects occur, as in 
the TL072. 
 The lowest load that a given opamp can be allowed to drive is an important design decision. 
It will typically be a compromise between the distortion performance required and opposing 
factors such as number of opamps in the circuit, cost of load-capable opamps, and so on. It 
even affects noise performance, for the lower the load resistance an amplifier can drive, the 
lower the resistance values in the negative feedback can be, and hence the lower the Johnson 
noise they generate. There are limits to what can be done in noise-reduction by this method, 
because Johnson noise is proportional to the square-root of circuit resistance, and so improves 
only slowly as opamp loading is increased. 
 Thermal distortion 
 Thermal distortion is that caused by cyclic variation of the properties of the amplifier 
components due to the periodic release of heat in the output stage. The result is a rapid rise in 
distortion at low frequencies, which gets worse as the loading becomes heavier. 
 Those who have read my work on audio power amplifiers will be aware that I am highly 
sceptical – in fact totally sceptical – about the existence of thermal distortion in amplifiers 
built from discrete components [3]. The power devices are too massive to experience per-
cycle parameter variations, and there is no direct thermal path from the output stage to 
the input devices. There is no rise, rapid or otherwise, in distortion at low frequencies in a 
properly designed discrete power amplifier. 
 The situation is quite different in opamps, where the output transistors have much less 
thermal inertia and are also on the same substrate as the input devices. Nonetheless, opamps 
do not normally suffer from thermal distortion; there is generally no rise in low frequency 
distortion, even with heavy output loading. Integrated-circuit power amplifiers are another 
matter, and the much greater amounts of heat liberated on the substrate do appear to cause 
serious thermal distortion, rising at 12 dB/octave below 50 Hz. I have never seen anything 
resembling this in any normal opamp. 

Opamps and their properties 129
 Common-mode distortion 
 This is the general term for extra distortion that appears when there is a large signal voltage 
on both the opamp inputs. The voltage difference between these two inputs will be very 
small, assuming the opamp is in its linear region, but the common-mode (CM) voltage can be 
a large proportion of the available swing between the rails. 
 It appears to be by far the least understood mechanism, and gets little or no attention in 
opamp textbooks, but it is actually one of the most important influences on opamp distortion. 
It is simple to separate this effect from the basic forward-path distortion by comparing THD 
performance in series and shunt feedback modes; this should be done at the same noise gain. 
The distortion is usually a good deal lower for the shunt feedback case where there is no 
common mode voltage. Bipolar and JFET input opamps show different behaviour and they 
are treated separately below.  
 Bipolar input opamps 
 Figure 4.4 shows the distortion from a 5532 working in shunt mode with low-value resistors 
of 1 kΩ and 2k2 setting a gain of 2.2 times, at an output level of 5 Vrms. This is the circuit of 
 Figure 4.3a with R s set to zero; there is no CM voltage. The distortion is well below 0.0005% 
up to 20 kHz; this underlines what a superlative bargain the 5532 is.  
 Figure 4.3:  Opamp test circuits with added source resistance Rs: a) shunt, b) series, c) voltage-
follower, d) voltage-follower with cancellation resistor in feedback path 

130 Chapter 4
 Figure 4.5 shows the same situation but with the output increased to 10 Vrms (the clipping 
level on ±18 V rails is about 12 Vrms) and there is now significant distortion above 10 kHz, 
though it only exceeds 0.001% at 18 kHz. 
 This remains the case when Rs in  Figure 4.3a is increased to 10 kΩ and 47 kΩ – the noise 
floor is higher but there is no real change in the distortion behaviour. The significance of this 
will be seen in a moment.  
 We will now connect the 5532 in the series feedback configuration, as in  Figure 4.3b ; note 
that the stage gain is greater at 3.2 times but the opamp is working at the same noise gain. 
The CM voltage is 3.1 Vrms. With a 10 Vrms output we can see in  Figure 4.6 that even with no 
added source resistance the distortion starts to rise from 2 kHz, though it does not exceed 
0.001% until 12 kHz. But when we add some source resistance Rs, the picture is radically 
worse, with serious mid-band distortion rising at 6 dB/octave, and roughly proportional to the 
amount of resistance added. We will note it is 0.0085% at 10 kHz with R s  47 kΩ.  
 The worst case for CM distortion is the voltage-follower configuration, as in  Figure 4.3c , 
where the CM voltage is equal to the output voltage.  Figure 4.7 shows that even with a 
 Figure 4.4:  5532 distortion in a shunt feedback circuit at 5 Vrms out. This shows the AP SYS-
2702 output (lower trace) and the opamp output (upper trace). Supply ±18 V 

 Figure 4.5 : 5532 distortion in the shunt feedback circuit of Figure 4.3b. Adding extra resistances 
of 10 kΩ and 47 kΩ in series with the inverting input does not degrade the distortion at all, but 
does bring up the noise ﬂ oor a bit. Test level 10 Vrms out, supply ±18 V

varying source resistances. 10 Vrms output 

132 Chapter 4
CM voltage of 10 Vrms, the distortion is no greater than for the shunt mode. However, 
when source resistance is inserted in series with the input, the distortion mixture of second, 
third and other low-order harmonics increases markedly. It increases with output level, 
approximately quadrupling as level doubles. The THD is now 0.018% at 10 kHz with 
R s  47 kΩ, more than twice that of the series-feedback amplifier above, due to the 
increased CM voltage.  
 It would be highly inconvenient to have to stick to the shunt feedback mode, because of 
the phase inversion and relatively low input impedance that comes with it, so we need to find 
out how much source resistance we can live with.  Figure 4.8 zooms in on the situation with 
resistance of 10 kΩ and below; when the source resistance is below 2k2, the distortion is 
barely distinguishable from the zero source resistance trace. This is why the low-pass Sallen 
and Key filters in  Chapter 6 have been given series resistors that do not in total exceed this 
figure.  Close examination reveals the intriguing fact that a 1 kΩ source actually gives  less 
distortion than no source resistance at all, reducing THD from 0.00065% to 0.00055% at 
10 kHz. Minor resistance variations around 1 kΩ make no difference. This must be due to 
the cancellation of distortion from two different mechanisms. It is hard to say whether it is 
repeatable enough to be exploited in practice.

level 10 Vrms, supply ±18 V. The lowest trace is the analyser output measured directly, as a reference 

Opamps and their properties 133
 So, what’s going on here? Is it simply due to non-linear currents being drawn by the 
opamp inputs? Audio power amplifiers have discrete input stages which are very simple 
compared with those of most opamps, and draw relatively large input currents. These currents 
show appreciable non-linearity even when the output voltage of the amplifier is virtually 
distortion-free, and if they flow through significant source resistances will introduce added 
distortion [4]. 
 If this was the case with the 5532 then the extra distortion would manifest itself whenever the 
opamp was fed from a significant source resistance, no matter what the circuit configuration. 
But we have just seen that it only occurs in series-feedback situations; increasing the source 
resistance in a shunt-feedback does not perceptibly increase distortion. The effect may be 
present but if so it is very small, no doubt because opamp signal input currents are also very 
small, and it is lost in the noise. 
 The only difference is that the series circuit has a CM voltage of about 3 Vrms, while the shunt 
circuit does not, and the conclusion is that with a bipolar input opamp, you must have  both  
a CM voltage and a significant source resistance to see extra distortion. The input stage of a 
5532 is a straightforward long-tailed pair (see  Figure 4.21 below) with a simple tail current

resistances; note that a 1 kΩ source resistance actually gives less distortion than none. Test level

source, and no fancy cascoding, and I suspect that Early effect operates on it when there is a 
large CM voltage, modulating the quite high input bias currents, and this is what causes the 
distortion. The signal input currents are much smaller, due to the high open-loop gain of the 
opamp, and as we have seen appear to have a negligible effect. 
 JFET opamps 
 FET input opamps behave differently from bipolar input opamps. Take a look at   Figure 4.9  , taken 
from a TL072 working in shunt and in series configuration with a 5 Vrms output. The circuits 
are as in  Figure 4.3a and  4.3b , except that the resistor values have to be scaled up to 10 kΩ and 
22 kΩ because the TL072 is nothing like so good at driving loads as the 5532. This unfortunately 
means that the inverting input is seeing a source resistance of 10k i 22k  6.9k, which introduces 
a lot of common-mode (CM) distortion – five times as much at 20 kHz as for the shunt case. 
Adding a similar resistance in the input path cancels out this distortion, and the trace then is the 
same as the “Shunt” trace in  Figure 4.9 . Disconcertingly, the value that achieved this was not 
6.9k, but 9k1. That means adding 113 dBu of Johnson noise, so it’s not always appropriate. 
 Figure 4.9 : A TL072 shunt-feedback stage using 10 kΩ and 22 kΩ resistors shows low distortion. 
The series version is much worse due to the impedance of the NFB network, but it can be made 
the same as the shunt case by adding cancellation source resistance in the input path. No external 
loading, test level 5 Vrms, supply ±18 V 

Opamps and their properties 135
 It’s worth mentioning that the flat part of the shunt trace below 10 kHz is not noise, as it 
would be for the 5532; it is distortion.  
 A voltage-follower has no inconvenient medium-impedance feedback network, but it does 
have a much larger CM voltage.  Figure 4.10 shows a voltage-follower working at 5 Vrms. 
With no source resistance the distortion is quite low, due to the 100% NFB, but as soon as a 
10 kΩ source resistance is added we are looking at 0.015% at 10 kHz.  
 Once again, this can be cured by inserting an equal resistance in the feedback path of the 
voltage-follower, as in  Figure 4.3d above. This gives the ‘Cancel’ trace in  Figure 4.10 . 
Adding resistances for distortion cancellation in this way has the obvious disadvantage that 
they introduce extra Johnson noise into the circuit. Another point is that stages of this kind 
are often driven from pot wipers, so the source impedance is variable, ranging between zero 
and one-quarter of the pot track resistance. Setting a balancing impedance in the other opamp 
input to a mid-value, i.e. one-eighth of the track resistance, should reduce the average amount 
of input distortion, but it is inevitably a compromise. 
 Figure 4.10:  A TL072 voltage-follower working at 5 Vrms with a low source resistance produces 
little distortion (Rs  0R), but adding a 10 kΩ source resistance makes things much worse (Rs  10K). 
Putting a 10 kΩ resistance in the feedback path as well gives complete cancellation of this extra 
distortion.  Supply ±18 V

136 Chapter 4
 With JFET inputs the problem is not the operating currents of the input devices themselves, 
which are negligible, but the currents drawn by the non-linear junction capacitances inherent 
in field-effect devices. These capacitances are effectively connected to one of the supply 
rails. For P-channel JFETs, as used in the input stages of most JFET opamps, the important 
capacitances are between the input JFETs and the substrate, which is normally connected to 
the V– rail. See Jung [5]. 
 According to the Burr-Brown data sheet for the OPA2134, ‘The P-channel JFETs in the input 
stage exhibit a varying input capacitance with applied CM voltage.’ It goes on to recommend 
that the input impedances should be matched if they are above 2 kΩ. 
 Common-mode distortion can be minimised by running the opamp off the highest supply 
rails permitted, though the improvements are not large. In one test on a TL072 going from 
±15 V to ±18 V rails reduced the distortion from 0.0045% to 0.0035% at 10 kHz. 
 Rail bootstrapping to reduce CM distortion 
 So what do you do if you need a really high-impedance low-distortion voltage-follower and 
you have a significant source resistance, but you don’t want the added noise that would come 
from adding a cancellation resistor? We noted above that the non-linear input capacitances 
that cause the trouble with JFET opamp voltage-followers are effectively connected to the 
V– supply rail or substrate. This suggests a way to remove the problem; if the supply rails 
are bootstrapped so they go up and down with the inputs, the signal voltage across the non-
linear input capacitances is zero, no current can flow through them, and no extra distortion is 
generated. 
 Figure 4.11a shows the idea. The resistor-Zener chain R4, D1, D2, R5 creates ±5 V rails 
which are moved up and down by opamp A4, and buffered by A2, A3. A1 expects reasonably 
low supply-rail impedances at HF, and attempting to run it directly from the outputs of A2, 
A3 does not work- the signal disappears in a fog of HF oscillation. The two resistors R2, R3 
prevent this by isolating C1 from A2, A3 outputs, while capacitor C1 across A1 supply pins 
keeps the HF rail impedance low. Since the ±5 V rails of A1 have to remain inside the fixed 
±15 V supply rails, the possible swing of the supplies is limited and the maximum output is 
reduced compared with a basic voltage-follower. The circuit of  Figure 4.11a clips at 6.7 Vrms 
(1 kHz). This could be increased somewhat by using ±17 V or ±18 V fixed rails.  
 Figure 4.12 shows the result of basic bootstrapping while handling a 5 Vrms signal, which 
as we saw earlier, is enough to cause serious CM distortion. The increase in linearity is 
encouraging as the distortion is promptly halved. 
 Figure 4.13 however, shows that we can do better by adding C2, C3. These are in parallel 
with the effective slope resistance of the Zeners, and improve the accuracy of the rail 
bootstrapping. The lower trace marked WITH is indistinguishable from that of the testgear 
alone.

 Figures 4.12 and  4.13 were taken with near-zero source resistance, and show that internal 
CM distortion has been dealt with. But what happens when a 10 kΩ source resistance is 
reintroduced?  
 Figure 4.14 gives the answer: adding a 10 kΩ source resistance now makes almost no 
difference. Note that no cancellation resistor has been put in the feedback path. 
 The rail bootstrapping concept was also tested with the TL052 and the OPA2134 at 5 Vrms, 
and similar dramatic reductions in CM distortion were found. 
 Simpler rail bootstrapping 
 On contemplating  Figure 4.11a , it may occur to you that using three opamps to make a 
friendly environment for one is a bit over-complex. You are quite right. It is always good to 
simplicate and add lightness when you can, and A2 and A3 can in fact be replaced by simple 
emitter followers with no detectable loss in performance, as in   Figure 4.11b . The two 47 Ω 
resistors have been removed, but C1 is retained. This seems to be reliably stable. The total 
supply voltage to A1 has been reduced by two V be drops, or 1.2 V; it could be restored by 
increasing the Zener voltages if required. The simpler version also uses less power as we no 
longer need to supply the quiescent currents of A2 and A3. 

140 Chapter 4
 The attentive reader will recall that the troublesome non-linear capacitances are effectively 
connected to the substrate, which is usually the V supply rail. Would it not be possible to 
bootstrap just that rail, and leave V connected to a fixed 15 V rail? It would; it works, but 
the results with an OPA2134, while more linear than a conventional voltage-follower, are worse 
than bootstrapping both rails. Before, we were keeping the magnitude of the A1 supply voltage 
substantially constant, although it was sailing up and down. If only one rail is bootstrapped, 
the actual supply voltage is being modulated, so it is hardly surprising that linearity suffers.  
 In the previous section we saw that CM distortion is also generated by bipolar input opamps, 
though by a different mechanism, so rail bootstrapping ought to work for these types of 
opamp as well.  Figure 4.15 shows that it does. Adding a 10 kΩ source resistance now causes 
virtually no extra distortion. 
 Bootstrapping series-feedback JFET opamp stages 
 The voltage-follower is the worst case for CM distortion, as the full output voltage exists on 
both inputs. In contrast, it is the best case for output loading, as there is no resistive feedback 
network at all to drive- just a high-impedance input pin. Similarly, the shunt feedback 
amplifier is the best case for CM distortion as there is no significant signal on the inputs. 
 Series-feedback amplifier stages fall between these two cases. For a 10 dB amplifier stage, 
the signal on the inputs is one-third that of the output, and so the input distortion is less, but

Opamps and their properties 141
still very definitely present, as we saw in  Figures 4.6 and  4.9 above. Amplifier stages like 
this can have a mixture of distortion mechanisms. The impedance of the negative feedback 
network, as seen from the inverting input of the amplifiers, is 22 kΩ in parallel with 10 kΩ, 
i.e. 6.87 kΩ. We have seen above that this is enough to cause serious non-linearity unless the 
other input sees the same impedance, and it might be thought that reducing the impedance 
level of the negative feedback network would be a good way to deal with this, not least 
because it would minimise the Johnson noise produced by the network.  Figure 4.16 shows 
that this does not work for the TL072; if the feedback network impedance is reduced by a 
factor of ten the distortion gets worse rather than better, due to the heavier loading on the 
output. Input distortion has been replaced by a larger amount of output distortion; this is not 
a good exchange. Lowering the NFB network impedance is however likely to be successful 
with JFET opamps having better load-driving capability than the TL072.  
 Rail bootstrapping is once more a possible answer. We drive the opamp supply rails up and 
down with the same signal as the  input – not the output. The only modification required is to 
take the increased output swing into account by increasing the A1 supply voltage to ±10 V; 
see  Figure 4.17 . The Zeners have been replaced with simple resistive dividers. This works 
just as well, and is a ‘good thing’ as Zeners are more expensive than resistors.  Figure 4.18 
shows the excellent results.

reduce input distortion, but output distortion more than makes up for it because of the extra

Opamps and their properties 143
 Selecting the right opamp 
 Until recently, the 5532 was pre-eminent. It is found in almost every mixing console, and in a 
large number of preamplifiers. Distortion is very low, even when driving 600 Ω loads. Noise 
is very low, and the balance of voltage and current noise in the input stage is well–matched 
to moving-magnet phono cartridges; in many applications discrete devices give no significant 
advantage. Large-quantity production has brought the price down to a point where a powerful 
reason is required to pick any other device. 
 The 5532 is not, however, perfect. It suffers common-mode distortion. It has high bias and offset 
currents at the inputs, as an inevitable result of using a bipolar input stage (for low noise) without 
any sort of bias-cancellation circuitry. The 5532 is not in the forefront for DC accuracy, though 
it's not actually that bad. The offset voltage spec is 0.5 mV typical, 4 mV max, compared with 
3 mV typical, 6 mV max for the popular TL072. I have actually used 5532s to replace TL072s 
when offset voltage was a problem, but the increased bias current was acceptable. 
 With horrible inevitability, the very popularity and excellent technical performance of the 
5532 has led to it being criticised by subjectivists who have contrived to convince themselves 
that they can tell opamps apart by listening to music played through them. This always makes 
me laugh, because there is probably no music on the planet that has not passed through a 
hundred or more 5532s on its way to the consumer. 
 The LM4562 represents a real advance on the 5532. It is however still a good deal more 
expensive, and is not perfect – it appears to be more easily damaged by excess common-
mode voltages, and there is some evidence it is more susceptible to RF demodulation. 
 In some applications, such as low-cost mixing consoles, bipolar-style bias currents are a 
real nuisance because keeping them out of EQ pots to prevent scratching noises requires an 
inappropriate number of blocking capacitors. There are plenty of JFET input opamps around 
with negligible bias currents, but there is no obviously superior device that is the equivalent 
of the 5532. The TL072 has been used in this application for many years but its HF linearity 
is not first-class and distortion across the band deteriorates badly as output loading increases. 
However, the opamps in many EQ sections work in the shunt-feedback configuration with 
no CM voltage on the inputs, and this reduces the distortion considerably. When low bias 
currents are needed with superior performance then the OPA2134 is often a good choice, 
though it is at least four times as expensive as the TL072. 
 Opamps surveyed: BJT input types 
 The rest of this chapter looks at some opamp types and examines their performance, with the 
5532 the usual basis for comparison. The parts shown here are not necessarily intended as 
audio opamps, though some, such as the OP275 and the OPA2134, were specifically designed 

144 Chapter 4
as such. They have however all seen use, in varying numbers, in audio applications. Bipolar 
input opamps are dealt with first. 
 The LM741 opamp 
 The LM741 is only included here for its historical interest; in its day it was a most significant 
development, and to my mind, the first really practical opamp. It was introduced by Fairchild 
in 1968 and is considered a second-generation opamp, the 709 being first generation. 
 The LM741 had (and indeed has) effective short-circuit protection and internal compensation 
for stability at unity gain, and was much easier to make work in a real circuit than its 
predecessors. It was clear that it was noisy compared with discrete circuitry, and you 
sometimes had to keep the output level down if slew-limiting was to be avoided, but with 
care it was usable in audio. Probably the last place the LM741 lingered was in the integrators 
of state-variable EQ filters, where neither indifferent noise performance nor poor slewing 
capability is a serious problem; see  Chapter 15 for more details on this application. The 
LM741 is a single opamp. The dual version is the LM747.  
 Figure 4.19 shows a region between 100 Hz and 4 kHz where distortion rises at 6 dB/octave. 
This is the result of the usual dominant-pole Miller compensation scheme. When slew-
limiting begins, the slope increases and THD rises rapidly with frequency.

3 Vrms and 6 Vrms outputs, with no load. At 6 Vrms, slew distortion exceeds 1% before 20 kHz 
is reached; there is visible slew-limiting in the waveform. THD is however very low at 100 Hz, due 
to the high NFB factor at low frequencies

Opamps and their properties 145
 The NE5532/5534 opamp 
 The 5532 is a low-noise, low distortion bipolar dual opamp, with internal compensation for 
unity-gain stability. The 5534 is a single version internally compensated for gains down to 
three times, and an external compensation capacitor can be added for unity-gain stability; 22 pF 
is the usual value. The 5532 achieves unity-gain stability by having degeneration resistors in 
the emitter circuits of the input transistors, to reduce the open-loop gain, and this is why it is 
noisier than the 5534. 
 The common-mode range of the inputs is a healthy ±13V, with no phase inversion problems 
if this is exceeded. It has a distinctly higher power consumption than the TL072, drawing 
approx 4 mA per opamp section when quiescent. The DIL version runs perceptibly warm 
when quiescent on ±17 V rails. 
 The 5534/5532 has bipolar transistor input devices. This means it gives low noise with low 
source resistances, but draws a relatively high bias current through the input pins. The input 
devices are NPN, so the bias currents flow into the chip from the positive rail. If an input 
is fed through a significant resistance then the input pin will be more negative than ground 
due to the voltage-drop caused by the bias current. The inputs are connected together with 
back-to-back diodes for reverse-voltage protection; and should not be forcibly pulled to 
different voltages. The 5532 is intended for linear operation, and using it as a comparator is 
not recommended. 
 As can be seen from  Figure 4.20 , the 5532 is almost distortion-free, even when driving 
the maximum 500 Ohm load. The internal circuitry of the 5532 has never been officially 
explained, but appears to consist of nested Miller loops that permit high levels of internal 
negative feedback. The 5532 is the dual of the 5534, and is much more commonly used than 
the single as it is cheaper per opamp and does not require an external compensation capacitor 
when used at unity gain. 
 The 5532/5534 is made by several companies, but they are not all created equal. Those by 
Fairchild, JRC, and ON-Semi have significantly lower THD at 20 kHz and above, and we’re 
talking about a factor of two or three here.  
 The 5532 and 5534 type opamps require adequate supply-decoupling if they are to remain 
stable; otherwise they appear to be subject to some sort of internal oscillation that degrades 
linearity without being visible on a normal oscilloscope. The essential requirement is that the 
ve and ve rails should be decoupled with a 100 nF capacitor between them, at a distance 
of not more than a few millimetres from the opamp; normally one such capacitor is fitted 
per package as close to it as possible. It is  not necessary, and often not desirable to have two 
capacitors going to ground; every capacitor between a supply rail and ground carries the risk 
of injecting rail noise into the ground.

 Deconstructing the 5532 
 To the best of my knowledge, virtually nothing has been published about the 
internal operation of the 5532. This is surprising given its unique usefulness as a 
high-quality audio opamp. I believe the secret of the 5532’s superb linearity is the 
use of nested negative feedback inside the circuit, in the form of traditional Miller 
compensation. 
 Figure 4.21 shows the only diagram of the internal circuitry that has been released; the 
component and node numbers are mine. It has been in the public domain for at least twenty 
years, so I hope no one is going to object to my impertinent comments on it. The circuit 
initially looks like a confusing sea of transistors, and there is even a solitary JFET lurking 
in there, but it breaks down fairly easily. There are three voltage-gain stages, plus a unity-
gain output stage to increase drive capability. This has current-sensing overload protection. 
 Figure 4.20 : Distortion is very low from the 5532, though loading makes a detectable difference. 
Here it is working in series feedback mode at the high level of 10 Vrms with 500 Ω, 1 kΩ loads 
and no load. The Gen-mon trace is the output of the distortion analyser measured directly. Gain 
of 3.2 times. Supply ±18 V 

Opamps and their properties 147
There is also a fairly complex bias generator which establishes the operating currents in the 
various stages. 
 In all conventional opamps there are two differential input signals which have to be 
subtracted to create a single output signal, and the node at which this occurs is called the 
‘phase-summing point’.  
 Q1, Q2 make up the input differential amplifier. They are protected against reverse-biasing by 
the diode-connected transistors across the input pins. Note there are no emitter degeneration 
resistors, which would linearise the input pair at the expense of degrading noise. Presumably 
high open-loop gain (note there are three gain stages, whereas a power amplifier normally 
only has two) means that the input pair is handling very small signal levels so its distortion is 
not a problem. 
 Q3, Q4 make up the second differential amplifier; emitter degeneration is now present. Phase 
summing occurs at the output of this stage at Node 2. C1 is the Miller capacitor around this 
 Figure 4.21:  The internal circuitry of the 5534. Note absence of emitter resistors for Q1 and Q2 

148 Chapter 4
stage, from Node 2 to Node 1. Q5, Q6, Q7 are a Wilson current-mirror which provides a 
driven current-source as the collector load of Q4. The function of C4 is obscure but it appears 
to balance C1 in some way. 
 The third voltage-amplifier stage is basically Q9 with split-collector transistor Q15 as its 
current-source load. Q8 increases the basic transconductance of the stage, and C3 is the 
Miller capacitor around it, feeding from Node 3 to Node 2- note that this Miller loop does 
not include the output stage. Things are a bit more complicated here as it appears that Q9 
is also the sink half of the Class-B output stage. Q14 looks very mysterious as it seems to 
be sending the output of the third stage back to the input; possibly it’s some sort of clamp 
to ensure clean clipping, but to be honest I haven’t a clue. Q10 plus associated diode 
generates the bias for the class-B output stage, just as in a power amplifier. 
 The most interesting signal path is the semi-local Miller loop through C2, from Node 3 to 
Node 1, which encloses both the second and third voltage amplifiers; each of these have 
their own local Miller feedback, so there are two nested layers of internal feedback. This is 
probably the secret of the 5532’s low distortion. 
 Q11 is the source side of the output stage, and as mentioned above, Q9 appears to be the 
sink. Q12, Q13 implement overcurrent protection. When the voltage drop across the 15 Ω 
resistor becomes too great, Q12 turns on and shunts base drive away from Q11. In the 
negative half-cycle, Q13 is turned on, which in turn activates Q17 to shunt drive away 
from Q8. 
 The biasing circuit shows an interesting point. Bipolar bias circuits tend not to be self-
starting; no current flows anywhere until some flows somewhere, so to speak. Relying on 
leakage currents for starting is unwise, so here the depletion-mode JFET provides a circuit 
element that is fully on until you bias it off, and can be relied upon to conduct as the power 
rails come up from zero. 
 More information on the internals of the 5534 can be found in reference [6]. 
 The LM4562 opamp 
 The LM4562 is a new opamp, which first became freely available at the beginning of 2007. 
It is a National Semiconductor product. It is a dual opamp – there is no single or quad 
version. It costs about ten times as much as a 5532. 
 The input noise voltage is typically 2.7nV/√ Hz, which is substantially lower than the 
4nV/√ Hz of the 5532. For suitable applications with low source impedances this translates 
into a useful noise advantage of 3.4 dB. The bias current is typically 10 nA, which is very 
low and would normally imply that bias-cancellation, with its attendant noise problems, was 

Opamps and their properties 149

a gain of 2.2. Shown for no load (NL) and 1 kΩ, 500 Ω loads. Note the vertical scale ends at 
0.001% this time. Output level is 10 Vrms. ±18 V supply rails 
being used. However, in my testing I have seen no sign of excess noise, and the data sheet is 
silent on the subject. No details of the internal circuitry have been released so far, and quite 
probably never will be. 
 It is not fussy about decoupling, and as with the 5532, 100 nF across the supply rails close to 
the package should ensure HF stability. The slew rate is typically ±20 V/μs, more than twice 
as quick as the 5532. 
 The first THD plot in  Figure 4.22 shows the LM4562 working at a closed-loop gain of 
2.2 times in shunt feedback mode, at a high level of 10 Vrms. The top of the THD scale is 
0.001%, something you will see with no other opamp in this survey. The no-load trace is 
barely distinguishable from the AP SYS-2702 output, and even with a heavy 500 Ω load 
driven at 10 Vrms there is only a very small amount of extra THD, reaching 0.0007% 
at 20 kHz.  
 Figure 4.23 shows the LM4562 working at a gain of 3.2 times in series feedback mode, both 
modes having a noise gain of 3.2 times. There is little extra distortion from 500 Ω.  

150 Chapter 4

gain of 3.2. No load (NL) and 500 Ω load. 10 Vrms output. ±18 V supply rails 
 For  Figures 4.22 and  4.23 the feedback resistances were 2k2 and 1 kΩ, so the minimum 
source resistance presented to the inverting input is 687 Ω. In  Figure 4.24 extra source 
resistances were then put in series with the input path, (as was done with the 5532 in the 
section above on common-mode distortion) and this revealed a remarkable property of 
the LM4562 – it is much more resistant to common-mode distortion than the 5532. At 
10 Vrms and 10 kHz, with a 10 kΩ source resistance the 5532 generates 0.0014% THD 
(see  Figure 4.6 ) but the LM4562 gives only 0.00046% under the same conditions. I strongly 
suspect that the LM4562 has a more sophisticated input stage than the 5532, probably 
incorporating cascoding to minimise the effects of common-mode voltages.  
 Note that only the rising curves to the right represent actual distortion. The raised levels of 
the horizontal traces at the LF end is due to Johnson noise from the extra series resistance. 
 It has taken an unbelievably long time – nearly 30 years – for a better audio opamp than the 
5532 to come along, but at last it has happened. The LM4562 is superior in just about every 
parameter, but it has much higher current noise. At present it also has a much higher price, 
but hopefully that will change.

 The AD797 opamp 
 The AD797 (Analog Devices) is a single opamp with very low voltage noise and distortion. 
It appears to have been developed primarily for the cost-no-object application of submarine 
sonar, but it works very effectively with normal audio – if you can afford to use it. The cost 
is something like 20 times that of a 5532. No dual version is available, so the cost ratio per 
opamp section is forty times. 
 This is a remarkably quiet device in terms of voltage noise, but current noise is 
correspondingly high due to the high currents in the input devices. Early versions appeared 
to be rather difficult to stabilise at HF, but the current product is no harder to apply than the 
5532. Possibly there has been a design tweak, or on the other hand my impression may be 
wholly mistaken.  
 The AD797 incorporates an ingenious feature for internal distortion cancellation. 
This is described on the manufacturer’s data sheet.  Figure 4.25 shows that it works 
effectively. 

152 Chapter 4
 The OP27 opamp 
 The OP27 from Analog Devices is a bipolar input, single opamp primarily designed for low 
noise and DC precision. It was not intended for audio use, but in spite of this it is frequently 
recommended for such applications as RIAA and tape head preamps. This is unfortunate, 
because while at first sight it appears that the OP27 is quieter than the 5534/5532, as the 
e n is 3.2nV/√ Hz compared with 4nV/√ Hz for the 5534, in practice it is usually slightly 
noisier. This is because the OP27 is in fact optimised for DC characteristics, and so has 
input bias-current cancellation circuitry that generates common-mode noise. When the 
impedances on the two inputs are very different – which is the case in RIAA preamps – 
the CM noise does not cancel, and this appears to degrade the overall noise performance 
significantly. 
 For a bipolar input opamp, there appears to be a high level of common-mode input 
distortion, enough to bury the output distortion caused by loading; see  Figures 4.26 and 
 4.27 . It is likely that this too is related to the bias-cancellation circuitry, as it does not 
occur in the 5532.  
 The maximum slew rate is low compared with other opamps, being typically 2.8 V/μs. 
However, this is not the problem it may appear. This slew rate would allow a maximum 
amplitude at 20 kHz of 16 Vrms, if the supply rails permitted it. I have never encountered any 
particular difficulties with decoupling or stability of the OP27.

 The OP270 opamp 
 The OP270 from Analog Devices is a dual opamp, intended as a ‘very low noise 
precision operational amplifier’ – in other words combining low noise with great DC 
accuracy. The input offset voltage is an impressively low 75 μV maximum. It has bipolar 
inputs with a bias current cancellation system; the presence of this is shown by the 
15 nA bias current spec, which is 30 times less than the 500 nA taken by the 5534, 
which lacks this feature. It will degrade the noise performance with unequal source 
resistances, as it does in the OP27. The input transistors are protected by back-to-back 
diodes.  
 The OP270 distortion performance suffers badly when driving even modest loads (see 
 Figures 4.28 and  4.29 ). The slew rate is a rather limited 2.4 V/μs, which is only just 
enough for a full output swing at 20 kHz. Note also that this is an expensive opamp, 
costing something like 25 times as much as a 5532; precision costs money. Unless you 
have a real need for DC accuracy, this part is not recommended. 

Opamps and their properties 155
 The OP275 opamp 
 The Analog Devices OP275 is one of the few opamps specifically marketed as an audio 
device. Its most interesting characteristic is the Butler input stage which combines bipolar 
and JFET devices. The idea is that the bipolars give accuracy and low noise, while the 
JFETs give speed and ‘the sound quality of JFETs’. That final phrase is not a happy thing 
to see on a datasheet from a major manufacturer; the sound of JFETs (if any) would be the 
sound of high distortion. Just give us the facts, please. 
 The OP275 is a dual opamp; no single version is available. It is quite expensive, about 
six times the price of a 5532, and its performance in most respects is inferior. It is 
noisier, has higher distortion, and does not like heavy loads (see  Figures 4.30 and  4.31 ). 
The CM range is only about two-thirds of the voltage between the supply rails, and  I bias  is 
high due to the BJT part of the input stage. Unless you think there is something magical 
about the BJT/JFET input stage – and I am quite sure there is not – it is probably best 
avoided.

Opamps and their properties 157
 The THD at 10 kHz with a 600 Ω load is 0.0025% for shunt and 0.009% for series feedback; 
there is significant CM distortion in the input stage, which is almost certainly coming from the 
JFETs (I appreciate the output levels are not the same but I think this only accounts for a small 
part of the THD difference). Far from adding magical properties to the input stage, the JFETs 
seem to be just making it worse. 
 Opamps surveyed: JFET input types 
 Opamps with JFET inputs tend to have higher voltage noise and lower current noise than BJT 
input types, and therefore give a better noise performance with high source resistances. Their 
very low bias currents often allow circuitry to be simplified. 
 The TL072 opamp 
 The TL072 is one of the most popular opamps, having very high-impedance inputs, with 
effectively zero bias and offset currents. The JFET input devices give their best noise 
performance at medium impedances, in the range 1 kΩ–10 kΩ. It has a modest power 
consumption at typically 1.4 mA per opamp section, which is significantly less than the 5532. 
The slew rate is higher than for the 5532, at 13 V/μs against 9 V/μs. The TL072 is a dual 
opamp. There is a single version called the TL071 which has offset null pins. 
 However, the TL072 is not THD free in the way the 5532 is. In audio usage, distortion depends 
primarily upon how heavily the output is loaded. The maximum loading is a trade-off between 
quality and circuit economy, and I would put 2 kΩ as the lower limit. This opamp is not the 
first choice for audio use unless the near-zero bias currents (which allow circuit economies by 
making blocking capacitors unnecessary), the low price, or the modest power consumption 
are dominant factors. 
 It is a quirk of this device that the input common-mode range does not extend all the way 
between the rails. If the common mode voltage gets to within a couple of volts of the V– rail, 
the opamp suffers phase reversal and the inputs swap their polarities. There may be really 
horrible clipping, where the output hits the bottom rail and then shoots up to hit the top one, 
or the stage may simply latch up until the power is turned off. 
 TL072s are relatively relaxed about supply rail decoupling, though they will sometimes show 
very visible oscillation if they are at the end of long thin supply tracks. One or two rail-to-rail 
decoupling capacitors (e.g. 100 nF) per few centimetres is usually sufficient to deal with this, but 
normal practice is to not take chances, and allow one capacitor per package as with other opamps. 
 Because of common-mode distortion, a TL072 in shunt configuration is always more linear. 
In particular compare the results for 3k3 load in   Figures 4.32 and  4.33 . At heavier loadings 
the difference is barely visible because most of the distortion is coming from the output stage.

conﬁ guration eliminates CM input distortion. Output level 3 Vrms, gain 3.2, rails ±15 V. No

closed-loop NFB factor determine the THD

Opamps and their properties 159
 TL072/71 opamps are prone to HF oscillation if faced with significant capacitance to ground 
on the output pin; this is particularly likely when they are used as unity-gain buffers with 
100% feedback. A few inches of track can sometimes be enough. This can be cured by an 
isolating resistor, in the 47 to 75 Ω range, in series with the output, placed at the opamp end 
of the track. 
 The TL052 opamp 
 The TL052 from Texas Instruments was designed to be an enhancement of the TL072, and 
so is naturally compared with it. Most of the improvements are in the DC specifications. The 
offset voltage is 0.65 mV typical, 1.5 mV max, compared with the TL072’s 3 mV typical, 
10 mV max. It has half the bias current of the TL072. This is very praiseworthy, but rarely 
of much relevance to audio. 
 The distortion however  is important, and this is worse rather than better. THD-performance is 
rather disappointing. The unloaded THD is low, as shown in  Figure 4.34 , in series feedback 
mode. As usual, practical distortion depends very much on how heavily the output is loaded. 
 Figure 4.35 below shows that it deteriorates badly for loads of less than 4k7.  
 The slew rate is higher than for the TL072, (18 V/μs against 13 V/μs) but the lower figure 
is more than adequate for a full-range output at 20 kHz, so this enhancement is of limited 
interest. The power consumption is higher, typically 2.3 mA per opamp section, which is

almost twice that of the TL072. Like the TL072, it is relatively relaxed about supply rail 
decoupling. In 2009 the TL052 cost at least twice as much as the TL072.  
 The OPA2134 opamp 
 The OPA2134 is a Burr-Brown product, the dual version of the OPA134. The manufacturer 
claims it has superior sound quality, due to its JFET input stage. Regrettably, but not surprisingly, 
no evidence is given to back up this assertion. The input noise voltage is 8nV/√ Hz, almost twice 
that of the 5532. The slew rate is typically ±20 V/μs, which is ample. It does not appear to be 
optimised for DC precision, the typical offset voltage being ±1 mV, but this is usually good 
enough for audio work. I have used it many times as a DC servo in power amplifiers, the low bias 
currents allowing high resistor values and correspondingly small capacitors. 
 The OPA2134 does not show phase-reversal anywhere in the common-mode range, which 
immediately marks it as superior to the TL072. 
 The two THD plots in  Figures 4.36 and  4.37 show the device working at a gain of three times 
in both shunt and series feedback modes. It is obvious that a problem emerges in the series 
plot, where the THD is higher by about three times at 5 Vrms and 10 kHz. This distortion 
increases with level, which immediately suggests common-mode distortion in the input stage. 
Distortion increases with even moderate loading; see  Figure 4.38 .

 This is a relatively modern and sophisticated opamp. When you need JFET inputs (usually 
because significant input bias currents would be a problem) this definitely beats the TL072; 
it is, however, four to five times more expensive.  
 The OPA604 opamp 
 The OPA604 from Burr-Brown is a single JFET-input opamp which has been specially designed 
to give low distortion. The simplified internal circuit diagram in the data sheet includes 
an enigmatic box intriguingly labelled ‘Distortion Rejection Circuitry’. This apparently 
‘linearizes the open-loop response and increases voltage gain’ but no details as to how 
are given; whatever is in there appears to have been patented so it ought to be possible 
to track it down. However, despite this, the distortion is not very low even with no load, 
(see  Figure 4.39 ) and is markedly inferior to the 5532. The OPA604 is not optimised for DC 
precision, the typical offset voltage being ±1 mV. The OPA2604 is the dual version, which 
omits the offset null pins.  
 The data sheet includes a discussion that attempts to show that JFET inputs produce a more 
pleasant type of distortion than BJT inputs. This unaccountably omits the fact that the much 
higher transconductance of BJTs means that they can be linearised by emitter degeneration 
so that they produce far less distortion of whatever type than a JFET input [7]. Given that the

Opamps and their properties 163
OPA604 costs five times as much as a 5532, it is not very clear under what circumstances this 
opamp would be a good choice. 
 The OPA627 opamp 
 The OPA627 from Burr-Brown is a laser-trimmed JFET input opamp with excellent DC 
precision; the input offset voltage being typically ±100 μV. The distortion is very low, even 
into a 600 Ω load, though it is increased by the usual common-mode distortion when series 
feedback is used. 
 The OP627 is a single opamp and no dual version is available. The OPA637 is a 
decompensated version only stable for closed-loop gains of five or more. This opamp makes 
a brilliant DC servo for power amplifiers, if you can afford it; it costs about 50 times as much 
as a 5532, which is 100 times more per opamp section, and about 20 times more per opamp 
than the OPA2134, which is my usual choice for DC servo work. 
 The current noise  i n is very low, the lowest of any opamp examined in this book, apparently 
due to the use of Difet (dielectrically isolated JFET) input devices, and so it will give a good 
noise performance with high source resistances. Voltage noise is also very respectable at 
5.2 nV/√ Hz, only fractionally more than the 5532.  
 The series feedback case barely has more distortion than the shunt one, and only at the 
extreme HF end. It appears that the Difet input technology also works well to prevent input 
non-linearity and CM distortion. See   Figures 4.40 and  4.41.

 Opamps for low voltages 
 High ﬁ delity from low voltages 
 Nowadays there is considerable interest in audio circuitry that can run from 5 V, typically 
obtained from a USB port. It is expected that reasonable quality will be obtained; what 
might be called ‘five-volt fidelity’. Since there is only a single 5 V rail available, the 
maximum possible peak voltage is clearly ±2.5 V, equivalent to 1.77 Vrms or 7.16 dBu (this 
calculation obviously ignores opamp output saturation voltages). A slew rate of only 0.31 V/μs 
is enough to give this maximum output at 20 kHz. 
 When the usual ±17 V rails are used, you get a maximum level of 12.02 Vrms or 23.81 dBu. 
Five-volt audio gives a maximum level that is 16.6 dB less, so the dynamic range is reduced 
by the same amount. If the same relative headroom is required, the nominal signal level will 
have to be correspondingly reduced by 16.6 dB, and the 5 V signal path will have a worse 
signal/noise ratio by 16.6 dB. Often a compromise between these two extremes is more 
appropriate. In this technology it is especially important to make sure that what dynamic 
range does exist is not compromised by deficiencies in design. 
 While 5 V was for many years the standard voltage for running digital circuitry, for some 
time now 3.3 V has been used to reduce power consumption and make larger processor 
ICs feasible. It is perhaps not very likely that applications will arise requiring quality audio 
circuitry to run off such a low supply, but the existence of opamps in  Table 5.1 that are rated 
to operate down to 2.7 V and even 2.2 V shows that opamp manufacturers have this sort of 
thing in mind. 
 With a single 3.3 V rail, the maximum possible peak voltage is ±1.65 V, equivalent to 1.17 Vrms 
or 3.55 dBu, ignoring output saturation voltages. This is 3.61 dB less than for a 5 V rail, 
so the dynamic range issue is that much more acute. A slew rate of only 0.21 V/μs is enough 
to give the maximum output at 20 kHz. 
 The issues of 5 V operation are considered first, followed by those of 3.3 V operation. 

168 Chapter 5
 Running opamps from a single 5 V supply rail 
 The vast majority of audio circuitry runs from dual supply rails; this has been the case 
ever since opamps became common in audio in the 1970s, and it was established that 
electrolytic capacitors could work satisfactorily and reliably without DC bias on them. When 
low voltages are used there is typically only one supply rail available, and it is necessary to 
bias the opamp outputs so they are halfway between the supply rail and ground. This is 
most economically done by an RC ‘V/2 generator’ which supplies bias to all the stages. 
This is sometimes called a ‘half-rail generator’. There is no necessity that the bias point 
be  exactly half of the supply rail. Some opamps clip earlier in one direction than the other, 
and a slight adjustment up or down of the half-rail may allow a larger symmetrical output 
swing. Having all the signal-carrying parts of the circuit displaced from ground means 
that DC blocking capacitors are frequently required, to keep DC out of volume controls 
and switches, counteracting any parts saving there may be in the power supply due to the 
single rail. 
 Figure 5.1 shows series and shunt feedback stages biased by a common V/2 generator R10, 
R11, C10. The shunt stage has a voltage gain of 2.2 times, set by R2 and R3. Capacitor C1 
performs DC-blocking at the input; R1 ensures that the DC level at the input cannot float up 
due to leakage through this capacitor. Likewise a blocking capacitor C2 is required to prevent 
DC flowing through the load.  
 The series feedback stage has a voltage gain of 3.2 times, which means it works at the same 
noise gain as the shunt stage (see  Chapter 22 for an explanation of noise gain) so comparative 
tests can be made in which the only difference is the common-mode voltage on the series

stage opamp input pins. The series circuit requires an extra blocking capacitor C3 to prevent 
DC flowing through the feedback network, and to reduce the gain to unity at zero frequency. 
An extra resistor R4 is needed to bias the stage input. 
 The V/2 generator typically uses a rather large capacitor to filter out disturbances on the 
supply rail. It is economical to share this with other stages, as shown in  Figure 5.1 . The low 
impedance of the filter capacitor should prevent interaction between stages, if they are not 
of high gain, but isolation will tend to fall with frequency. If a good crosstalk performance 
at LF is required in stereo circuitry it may be necessary to use separate V/2 generators for 
each channel. 
 One of the great advantages of dual-rail operation is that the opamp supply currents, which to 
some extent have the same half-wave rectified nature as those in a Class-B power amplifier, 
are inherently kept out of the signal ground. With single-rail operation the negative supply 
pin of an opamp will be at 0 V, but any temptation to connect it to signal ground must be 
stoutly resisted, or the half-wave rectified currents flowing will cause serious distortion. It is 
essential to provide a separate power ground, as shown in  Figure 5.1 , which only joins the 
signal ground back at the power supply. 
 Opamps for 5 V operation 
 Table 5.1 shows some candidates for low-voltage operation. The table has been restricted to 
those opamps capable of working from 5 V or lower. This therefore excludes the ubiquitous 
5532 (with a minimum of 6 V) though it has been tested, with results given in the text. Those 
opamps that have been tested are shown in bold. 
Figure 5.1: Opamps running from a single supply rail, with a half-rail biasing generator shared 
between the two stages

170 Chapter 5
 The NE5532 in 5 V operation 
 When an attempt is made to run the 5532 from a 5 V rail, the maximum output (with no 
load beyond the shunt feedback network) is only 845 mVrms (at 1% THD) compared with 
the 1.77 Vrms theoretically available. This is only 48% of the possible voltage swing – less 
than half – and the 5532 output stage is clearly not performing well at a task it was never 
intended to do. Shunt feedback was used to exclude any common-mode distortion in the 
opamp input stage, with a gain of 2.2 times, as in   Figure 5.1 . Distortion is high, even at lower 
levels such as 700 mVrms, but falls below the relatively high noise level at 500 mV out. 
Perhaps most importantly, using any IC outside of its specifications is very risky because 
one batch may work acceptably but another not at all. 
 The LM4562 in 5 V operation 
 The much newer LM4562 opamp has a supply specification reaching lower down to 5 V, so 
we expect better low-voltage performance. We get it too; the maximum output with no load is 
1.16 Vrms (1% THD), a more reasonable 65% of the possible voltage swing, but this is still 
very inefficient compared with the same opamp working from ±17 V rails.

Opamps for low voltages 171
 The distortion performance for three output levels, with shunt feedback and a gain 
of 2.2 times as in  Figure 5 .1 is shown in  Figure 5.2 . The flat traces simply represent 
noise and no distortion is visible in the THD residual except around 10–20 kHz 
for a 1.0 Vrms output. You will note that the relative noise levels, and hence the 
minimum measurable THD levels, are considerably higher than for opamps on 
±17 V rails  
 The LM4562 is thus a possibility for 5 V operation, but the 3.7 dB loss in maximum 
output caused by that 65% when the dynamic range is already being squeezed is 
very unwelcome. There is also the point that the opamp is working right on the lower 
limit of its supply specs, which is not ideal. I found some evidence that the noise 
performance was impaired compared with ±17 V rails, with a noticeable incidence of 
burst noise. The NE5532 is at least cheap, but the LM4562 is still relatively expensive. 
There may therefore be no economic disadvantage in using specialised low-voltage 
opamps which are also expensive but designed for the job. We will examine some of 
them now. 
 The AD8022 in 5 V operation 
 The AD8022 from Analog devices looks like a possible candidate, having an exceptionally 
low input noise density of 2.3 nV/√ Hz that should allow maximisation of the dynamic 
range. It is a bipolar opamp with a wide supply range from 5 V to 24 V for single-
rail operation, or ±2.5 V to ±12 V for dual rails; we would therefore still be operating at 
the lower limit of supply voltage. It is fabricated using a high-voltage bipolar process 
called XFCB. 
 Firstly, the maximum output is 1.18 Vrms (no load, 1% THD), 67% of the available 
voltage swing; this is only a tiny improvement on the LM4562. The distortion 
performance, using shunt feedback and a gain of 2.2 times as in  Figure 5.1 , is not 
inspiring. According to the data sheet we can expect second harmonic at 80 dB, (0.01%) 
and third harmonic at 90 dB, (0.003%) with a 0.7 Vrms output into a 500 Ω load, flat 
with frequency.  Figure 5.3 shows the measured results for various output levels; they are 
markedly worse than the data sheet suggests, for reasons unknown. Note that we have 
changed the THD scale radically to accommodate the much higher levels, and the flat 
traces here really do represent distortion rather than noise. Several samples were tested 
with near-identical results.  
 These distortion levels are too high for any sort of quality audio, and the AD8022 will not 
be a good choice in most cases. No tests were therefore done on how distortion varies with 
output loading. However, for some applications it may be worth bearing in mind that its input 
noise density is exceptionally low at 2.3 nV/√ Hz. 

172 Chapter 5
 The AD8397 in 5 V operation 
 The AD8397 is another promising possibility, because it claims a very voltage-efficient output 
stage and good load-driving capabilities. The input noise density is somewhat higher at 4.5 
nV/√ Hz , slightly better than a 5532 and slightly worse than a 5534. It is a bipolar opamp with a 
wide supply range from 3 V to 24 V (for single-rail operation) or ±1.5 V to ±12 V for dual rails; 
this means that at 5 V we are not operating at the lower supply voltage limit, which increases our 
confidence. It is fabricated using a complementary bipolar high voltage process called XFCB-HV. 
 The first good result is that the AD3897 really is voltage-efficient. The maximum output with 
no external load is 1.83 Vrms at 1% THD. This is actually  more than the theoretical output 
of 1.77 Vrms because the 1% THD criterion relies on some clipping to create the distortion. 
If we instead use as our output criterion the first hint of disturbance on the THD residual, we 
get exactly 1.77 Vrms, which is 100% voltage efficiency! Adding a 100 Ω load only reduces 
this to 1.72 Vrms. 
 The measured THD results, using shunt feedback and a gain of 2.2 times as in  Figure 5.1 , are 
shown in  Figure 5.4 for various output levels (note that the noise gain is higher at 3.2). The 
flat parts of the traces represent noise only, with detectable distortion only appearing above 
Figure 5.3: AD8022 THD with 5 V supply for output levels of 0.3 V, 0.5 V, 0.7 V and 1.0 Vrms.

10 kHz, except at 1.76 Vrms out. The measured relative noise levels obviously fall as the 
output voltage increases.  
 The unloaded distortion results are very encouraging, but how are they affected by an 
external load on the output? Hardly at all, as  Figure 5.5 shows; the output level is close to the 
maximum at 1.5 Vrms, and the external loads go down to 220 Ω, well below the minimum 
5532 load of 500 Ω. Shunt feedback was used.  
 The AD8397 data sheet refers to loads down to an impressively low 25 Ω, so we want to 
explore the linearity with loading a bit further.  Figure 5.6 shows the measured THD results 
with No Load (NL) and external loads of 220 Ω, 150 Ω and 100 Ω, again at an output of 
1.5 Vrms. Not until the load falls to 150 Ω do we start to see significant distortion appearing 
above 1 kHz, and this promises that this opamp will work well with low-impedance designs 
that will minimise noise and optimise the dynamic range.  
 So far, so good. The next thing to investigate is the distortion performance using series 
feedback, which puts a significant common-mode signal on the input pins. The test circuit 
used is the series stage in  Figure 5.1 , which has a gain of 3.2 times, but the same noise gain 
(3.2 times) as the shunt circuit.  Figure 5.7 shows the measured THD results with No Load (NL)

and external loads of 220 Ω, 150 Ω and 100 Ω, again at an output of 1.5 Vrms. The distortion 
behaviour is clearly worse with series feedback for loads of 220 Ω or lower; care will be 
needed if low impedances are to be driven from a series feedback stage using an AD8397.  
 The worst-case for common-mode voltage is the voltage-follower configuration, where the 
full output voltage is present on the input terminals, and this exposes a limitation of the 
AD8397. The output stage does a magnificent job of using the whole available voltage swing, 
but the input stage does not quite have a full rail-to-rail capability. This means that voltage-
follower stages, where the input and feedback signals are equal to the output signal, have a 
limitation on output level set by the input stage rather than the output stage. The distortion 
performance is also significantly worse than for the case of series feedback with a gain of 
3.2 times.  Figure 5.8 demonstrates that distortion rises quickly as the signal level exceeds 
0.9 Vrms. If you want to make use of the full output swing then voltage-followers should be 
avoided. A relatively small amount of voltage gain – for example, 1.1 times – will reduce the 
signal levels on the input pins and allow the full output swing with low distortion.  
 Common mode distortion is worsened when the opamp is fed from a significant source 
resistance. Our final test is to drive a voltage-follower through a 4k7 resistance.  Figure 5.9 shows 
that distortion is much increased compared with  Figure 5.8 . We had about 0.0025% THD with a 
1.05 Vrms signal, but adding the 4k7 in series with the input has increased that to 0.007%.

Opamps for low voltages 177
 To conclude, the AD8397 is a useful opamp for 5 V operation; it is the best I have evaluated 
so far. It is however necessary to keep an eye on the effects of common-mode distortion and 
source resistance, and be aware of the voltage limits of the input stage. 
 Opamps for 3.3 V single-rail operation 
 Firstly, forget about the NE5532. Its maximum output on a 3.3 V rail (with appropriate 
half-rail biasing) is only 240 mVrms (1% THD). This is a meagre 20% of the available 
voltage swing and is clearly very inefficient. There is considerable distortion and the residual 
shows nasty crossover spikes of the sort associated with under-biased power amplifiers. 
Finally, using any IC so far outside of its specifications is very dangerous indeed – one batch 
may work acceptably but another batch not at all. 
 The LM4562 works rather better from 3.3 V, giving 530 mVrms (1% THD). This is a 
slightly more respectable 45% of the available voltage swing, but the objection to using it 
outside of its specifications remains. The THD at output levels up to 430 mVrms is around 
0.01%, which is not very encouraging. 
 The AD8397, however, works well at 3.3 V. The maximum output is now 1.18 Vrms (1% THD). 
The measured THD results, using shunt feedback and a gain of 2.2 times as in   Figure 5.1 , are 
shown in  Figure 5.10 for differing output levels. The flat parts of the traces represent noise

only, with detectable distortion only appearing above 10 kHz. Compare this with the 5 V 
results in  Figure 5.4 above; there is little difference, though the maximum test level is, of 
course, less.  
 At 3.3 V the AD8397 still works well with quite heavy loading.  Figure 5.11 shows that 
loads lighter than 560 Ω have very little effect on the distortion performance, while 330 Ω 
causes detectable distortion only above 2 kHz.  Figure 5.12 demonstrates that heavier loads 
than this lead to significant distortion. The AD8022 was not evaluated for 3.3 V operation 
as its minimum voltage is 5 V.

 Analogue filter design is an enormous subject, and it is of course quite impossible to cover 
even its audio aspects in a single chapter. A much, much more detailed account is given in 
my book  The Design of Active Crossovers , which gives practical examples of just about every 
filter type you can think of [1]. There are several standard textbooks on filter theory [2] [3] 
[4], and there would be no point in trying to create another one here. This chapter instead 
aims to give information on audio applications not found in the standard textbooks. 
 Filter design is at the root highly mathematical, and it is no accident that all of the common 
filter characteristics such as Bessel, Gaussian, Chebyshev, and Legendre are named after 
mathematicians. A notable exception is the Butterworth characteristic, probably the most 
popular and useful characteristic of all; Stephen Butterworth was a British engineer [5]. Here 
however I am going to avoid the complexities of pole and zero placement etc. and concentrate 
on practical filter designs that can be adapted for different frequencies by simply scaling 
component values. Most filter textbooks give complicated equations for calculating the 
amplitude and phase response at any desired frequency. This is less necessary now access can 
be assumed to a simulator, which will give all the information you could possibly want, much 
more quickly and efficiently than wrestling with calculations. Free simulator packages can be 
downloaded. Filters are widely used in different kinds of audio system, and I make frequent 
references to them in other chapters. 
 Filters are either passive or active. Passive or LCR filters use only resistors, inductors, and 
capacitors. Active filters use resistors, capacitors, and gain elements such as opamps; active 
filter technology is usually adopted with the specific intent of avoiding inductors and their 
well-known limitations. Nevertheless, there are some applications where LCR filters are 
essential. 
 Passive ﬁ lters 
 Passive filters do not use active electronics, and this is a crucial advantage in some 
applications. They are not subject to slew rate limiting, semiconductor non-linearity, or errors 
due to falling open-loop gain, and this makes them the best technology for roofing filters. 

182 Chapter 6
A roofing filter is one that stops out-of-band frequencies before they reach the first stage of 
electronics, and so prevents RF demodulation and slew limiting. A classic application is in 
the measurement of Class-D power amplifiers, which emit copious quantities of RF that will 
greatly upset audio measuring equipment. The answer, as described by Bruce Hofer [6] is 
a passive LCR roofing filter. There are many excellent text books that describe LCR filter 
design, such as [2] and [3], and I am not going into it here. 
 Active ﬁ lters 
 Active filters do not normally use inductors as such, though configurations such as gyrators 
that explicitly model the action of an inductor are sometimes used. The active element need 
not be an opamp; the Sallen and Key configuration requires only a voltage follower, which in 
some cases can be a simple BJT emitter-follower. Opamps are usual nowadays, however. The 
rest of this chapter deals only with active filters. 
 Low-pass ﬁ lters 
 Probably the most common use of low-pass filters is at the output of DACs to remove the 
high-frequency spurii that remain after oversampling; see Chapter 26 for more on this. They 
are also used to explicitly define the upper limit of the audio bandwidth in a system at, say, 
50 kHz (see the example of a record-cutting amplifier in Chapter 8), though more often this 
is done by the casual accumulation of a lot of first-order roll-offs in succeeding stages. This is 
not a duplication of input RF filtering (i.e. roofing filtering) which, as described in Chapter 18, 
must be passive and positioned before the incoming signals encounter any electronics which 
can demodulate RF. Low-pass filters are also used in PA systems to protect power amplifiers 
and loudspeakers against ultrasonic oscillation in the system. 
 In what might be called The First Age of Vinyl, a fully-equipped preamplifier would 
certainly have had a switchable low-pass filter, called, with brutal frankness, the 
‘scratch’ filter. This, having a slope of 12 or 18 dB/octave, faster than the tone-control 
stage, and rolling off at a higher frequency around 5–10 kHz, was aimed at suppressing, 
or at any rate dulling, record surface noise and the inevitable ticks and clicks; see 
Chapter 9 for much more on this. Interestingly, preamplifiers today, in The Second 
Age of Vinyl rarely have this facility, probably because it requires you to face up to the 
fact that the reproduction of music from mechanical grooves cut into vinyl is really not 
very satisfactory. Low-pass filters are of course essential to electronic crossovers for 
loudspeaker systems. 

Filters 183
 High-pass ﬁ lters 
 High-pass filters are widely used. Preamplifiers for vinyl disk usage are commonly fitted 
with subsonic filtering, often below 10 Hz, to keep disturbances due to record warps 
and ripples from reaching the loudspeakers. Subsonic noise may affect the linearity of 
the speaker for the worse as the bass unit is often moved through a substantial part of 
its mechanical travel; this is particularly true for reflex designs with no cone loading at 
very low frequencies. If properly designed, this sort of filtering is considered inaudible 
by most people. In The First Age of Vinyl, preamplifiers sometimes were fitted with a 
‘rumble filter’ which began operations at a higher frequency – typically 35 or 40 Hz – to 
deal with more severe disk problems, and would not be considered inaudible by anyone. 
Phono subsonic filtering is comprehensively dealt with in Chapter 8 on moving-magnet 
preamplifiers. 
 Mixer input channels very often have a switchable high-pass filter at a higher frequency 
again, usually 100 Hz. This is intended to deal with low-frequency proximity effect 
with microphones and general environmental rumblings. The slope required to do this 
effectively is at least 12 dB/octave, putting it outside the capabilities of the EQ section. 
Some mixer high-pass filters are third-order (18 dB/octave), and fourth-order (24 dB/
octave) ones have been used occasionally. Once again, high-pass filters are used in 
electronic crossovers. 
 Combined low-pass and high-pass ﬁ lters 
 When both subsonic and ultrasonic filters are required they can sometimes be economically 
combined into one stage using only one opamp, to give audio band definition. Filter 
combination is usually only practicable when the two filter frequencies are widely separated. 
There is more on this in Chapter 8. 
 Bandpass ﬁ lters 
 Bandpass filters are principally used in mixing consoles and stand-alone equalisers 
(see Chapter 15). The Q required rarely exceeds a value of 5, which can be implemented 
with relatively simple active filters, such as the multiple-feedback type. Higher Qs or 
independent control of all the resonance parameters require the use of the more complex 
bi-quad or state-variable filters. Bandpass and notch filters are said to be ‘tuneable’ if 
their  centre frequency can be altered relatively easily, say by changing only one 
component value. 

184 Chapter 6
 Notch ﬁ lters 
 Notch filters are mainly used in equalisers to deal with narrow peaks in the acoustic response 
of performance spaces, and in some electronic crossovers – see, for example, [7]. They can 
also be used to remove a single interfering frequency – once, a long time ago, I was involved 
with a product that had a slide-projector in close proximity to a cassette player. Hifi was not 
the aim, but even so, the enormous magnetic field from the projector transformer induced an 
unacceptable amount of hum into the cassette tape head. Mu-metal only helped a bit, and the 
fix was a filter that introduced notches at 50 Hz and 100 Hz, working on the ‘1 – bandpass’ 
principle, of which more later. 
 All-pass ﬁ lters 
 All-pass filters are so-called because they have a flat frequency response, and so pass all 
frequencies equally. Their point is that they have a phase-shift that  does vary with frequency, 
and this is often used for delay correction in electronic crossovers. You may occasionally see 
a reference to an all-stop filter, which has infinite rejection at all frequencies. This is a filter 
designer’s joke. 
 Filter characteristics 
 The simple second-order bandpass responses are basically all the same, being completely 
defined by centre frequency, Q, and gain. High-pass and low-pass filter characteristics are 
much more variable and are selected as a compromise between the need for a rapid roll-off, 
flatness in the passband, and a clean transient response. The Butterworth (maximally-flat) 
characteristic is the most popular for many applications. Filters with pass-band ripple, such 
as the Chebyshev or elliptical types, have not found favour for in-band filtering, such as 
in electronic crossovers, but were once widely used for applications like ninth-order anti-
aliasing filters; such filters have mercifully been made obsolete by oversampling. The Bessel 
characteristic gives a maximally flat group delay (maximally linear phase response) across 
the passband, and so preserves the waveform of filtered signals, but it has a much slower roll-
off than the Butterworth. 
 Sallen and Key ﬁ lters 
 The Sallen and Key filter configuration was introduced by R. P. Sallen and E. L. Key of 
the MIT Lincoln Laboratory as long ago as 1955 [8]. It became popular as the only active 
element required is a unity-gain buffer, so in the days before opamps were cheap it could be 
effectively implemented with a simple emitter-follower. 

Filters 185
 Figure 6.1 shows a second-order low-pass Sallen and Key filter with a 3 dB frequency of 
624 Hz and a Q of 0.707, together with the pleasingly simple design equations for cutoff 
(3 dB) frequency f 0 and Q. It was part of a fourth-order Linkwitz-Riley electronic crossover 
for a three-way loudspeaker [9]. The main difference you will notice from textbook filters is 
that the resistor values are rather low and the capacitor values correspondingly high. This is 
an example of low-impedance design, where low resistor values minimise Johnson noise and 
reduce the effect of the opamp current noise and common-mode distortion. The measured 
noise output is 117.4 dBu. This is after correction by subtracting the testgear noise floor.  
 It is important to remember that a Q of 1 does not give the maximally-flat Butterworth 
response; you must use 0.707. Sallen and Key filters with a Q of 0.5 are used in second-order 
Linkwitz-Riley crossovers, but these are not favoured because the 12 dB/octave roll-off of the 
high-pass filter is not steep enough to reduce the excursion of a driver when a flat frequency 
response is obtained [9]. 
 Sallen and Key low-pass filters have a lurking problem. When implemented with opamps, the 
response does not carry on falling for ever at the filter slope – instead it reaches a minimum 
and starts to come back up at 6 dB/octave. This is because the filter action relies on C1 seeing 
a low impedance to ground, and the impedance of the opamp output rises with frequency due 
to falling open-loop gain and hence falling negative feedback. When the circuit of  Figure 6.1 
is built using a TL072, the maximum attenuation is 57 dB at 21 kHz, rising again and 
flattening out at 15 dB at 5 MHz. This type of filter should not be used to reject frequencies 
well above the audio band; a low-pass version of the multiple feedback filter is preferred. 
 Low-pass filters used to define the top limit of the audio bandwidth are typically second-order 
with roll-off rates of 12 dB/octave; third-order 18 dB/octave filters are rather rarer, probably 
because there seems to be a general feeling that phase changes are more audible at the top

end of the audio spectrum than the bottom. Either the Butterworth (maximally flat frequency 
response) or Bessel type (maximally flat group delay) can be used. It is unlikely that there is 
any real audible difference between the two types of filter in this application, as most of the 
action occurs above 20 kHz, but using the Bessel alignment does require compromises in the 
effectiveness of the filtering because of its slow roll-off. I will demonstrate.  
 The standard Butterworth filter in  Figure 6.2 a has its 3 dB point set to 50 kHz, and this 
gives a loss of only 0.08 dB at 20 kHz, so there is minimal intrusion into the audio band; see 
 Figure 6.3 . The response is a useful 11.6 dB at 100 kHz and an authoritative 24.9 dB at 
200 kHz. C1 is made up of two 2n2 capacitors in parallel.  
 But let us suppose we are concerned about linear phase at high frequencies and we decide to 
use a Bessel filter. The only circuit change is that C1 is now 1.335 times as big as C2 instead 
 Figure 6.2:   Second-order Sallen and Key low-pass circuits for ultrasonic ﬁ ltering: a) Butterworth, 
b) Bessel. Both have a loss of less than 0.2 dB at 20 kHz

of two times, but the response is very different. If we design for 3 dB at 50 kHz again, we 
find that the response is 0.47 dB at 20 kHz; a lot worse than 0.08 dB, and not exactly a 
stunning figure for your spec sheet. If we decide we can live with 0.2 dB at 20 kHz then the 
Bessel filter has to be designed for 3 dB at 72 kHz; this is the design shown in Figure 6.2b. Due 
to the inherently slower roll-off, the response is only down to 5.6 dB at 100 kHz, and 14.9 dB 
at 200 kHz, as seen in  Figure 6.3 ; the latter figure is 10 dB worse than for the Butterworth. 
The measured noise output for both versions is 114.7 dBu using 5532s.  
 If we want to keep the 20 kHz loss to 0.1 dB, the Bessel filter has to be designed for 3 dB 
at 100 kHz, and the response is now only 10.4 dB down at 200 kHz, more than 14 dB less 
effective than the Butterworth. These results are summarised in  Table 6.1 :

 Discussions on filters always remark that the Bessel alignment has a slower roll-off, but often 
fail to emphasise that it is a  much slower roll-off. You should think hard before you decide to 
go for the Bessel option in this sort of application. 
 It is always worth checking how the input impedance of a filter loads the previous stage. In 
this case, the input impedance is high in the pass-band, but above the roll-off point it falls 
until it reaches the value of R1, which here is 1 kΩ. This is because at high frequencies C1 
is not bootstrapped, and the input goes through R1 and C1 to the low-impedance opamp 
output which is effectively at ground. Fortunately this low impedance only occurs at high 
frequencies, where one hopes the level of the signals to be filtered out will be low. 
 Another important consideration with low-pass filters is the balance between the R and C 
values in terms of noise performance. R1 and R2 are in series with the input and their Johnson 
noise will be added directly to the signal. Here the two 1 kΩ resistors together generate 
119.2 dBu of noise (22 kHz bandwidth, 25 °C). The obvious conclusion is that R1 and R2 
should be made as low in value as possible without causing excess loading, (and 1 kΩ is not 
a bad compromise) with C1, C2 scaled to maintain the desired roll-off frequency. 
 The need for specific capacitor ratios creates problems as capacitors are available in a much 
more limited range of values than resistors, usually the E6 series, running 10, 15, 22, 33, 
47, 68. C1 or C2 often has to be made up of two capacitors in parallel.  

188 Chapter 6
 Figure 6.4 shows a second-order high-pass Sallen and Key filter with a 3 dB frequency of 
5115 Hz and a Q of 0.707, with its design equations; this was another part of the electronic 
crossover. The capacitors are equal while the resistors must have a ratio of two. The measured 
noise output of this filter is 115.2 dBu.  
 A variation on the low-pass Sallen and Key that can avoid capacitor ratio difficulties is shown 
in  Figure 6.5 . The unity-gain buffer is replaced with a voltage gain stage; the gain set by R3 
and R4 must be 1.586 times (4.00 dB) for a Q of 0.707. This allows C1 and C2 to be the 
same value. An equal-resistor-value high-pass filter can be made in exactly the same way. 
 To get a faster roll-off, we can use a third-order filter, which is a first-order filter (i.e. a simple 
RC time constant) cascaded with a second-order filter that has a Q of 1.0, causing a response 
peak. This peak combined with the slow first-order roll-off gives a flat passband and then

a steep roll-off.  Figure 6.6 a shows a third-order Butterworth filter with a 3 dB frequency 
of 100 Hz, as might be used at the front end of a mixer channel. It is built the obvious way, 
with a first-order filter R1, C1 followed by a unity-gain buffer to give low-impedance drive to 
the following second-order filter. R2 and R3 now have a ratio of 4 to obtain a Q of 1.0. E24 
resistor values are shown and in this case they give an accurate response.  
 A more economical way to make a third-order filter is shown in Figure 6.6b, which saves an 
opamp section. The resistor values shown are the nearest E96 values to the mathematically 
exact numbers, and give an extremely accurate response. The nearest E24 values are R1  2k4, 
R2  910 Ω, and R3  16 kΩ, giving a very small peaking of 0.06 dB at 233 Hz. Errors due 
to the capacitor tolerances are likely to be larger than this. The distortion performance may 
not be as good as for Figure 6.6a.
 Fourth–order filters are the steepest in normal use. They are made by cascading two second-
order filters with Qs of 0.54 and 1.31. They can also be made in the same way as Figure 6.5b, 
but if so tend to be rather sensitive to component tolerances. 
 Distortion in Sallen and Key ﬁ lters 
 When they have a signal voltage across them, many capacitor types generate distortion. 
This unwelcome phenomenon is described in Chapter 2. It afflicts not only all electrolytic 
capacitors, but also some types of non-electrolytic ones. If the electrolytics are being used 
 Figure 6.6 : Two third-order Butterworth highpass ﬁ lters with a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz 

190 Chapter 6
as coupling capacitors, then the cure is simply to make them so large that they have a 
negligible signal voltage across them at the lowest frequency of interest; less than 80 mVrms 
is a reasonable criterion. This means they may have to be ten times the value required for a 
satisfactory frequency response. 
 However when non-electrolytics are used to set time-constants in filters they obviously 
must have substantial signal voltages across them and this simple fix is not usable. The 
problem is not a marginal one – the amounts of distortion produced can be surprisingly 
high.  Figure 6.7 shows the frequency response of a conventional second-order Sallen and 
Key high-pass filter as seen in   Figure 6.4  , with a 3 dB frequency of 520 Hz. C1, C2 were 
220 nF 100V polyester capacitors, with R1  1 kΩ and R2  2 kΩ. The opamp was a 5532. 
The distortion performance is shown by the upper trace in  Figure 6.8 ; above 1 kHz the 
distortion comes from the opamp alone and is very low. However you can see it rising rapidly 
below 1 kHz as the filter begins to act, and it has reached 0.015 % by 100 Hz, completely 
overshadowing the opamp distortion; it is basically third-order. The input level was 10 Vrms, 
which is about as much as you are likely to encounter in an opamp system. The output from 
the filter has dropped to 28 dB by 100 Hz, and so the amplitude of the harmonics generated 
is correspondingly lower, but it still not a very happy outcome.  
 As explained in Chapter 2, polypropylene capacitors exhibit negligible distortion compared 
with polyester, and the lower trace in  Figure 6.8 shows the improvement on substituting 
220 nF 250 V polypropylene capacitors. The THD residual below 500 Hz is now pure 
noise, and the trace is only rising at 12 dB/octave because circuit noise is constant but 
 Figure 6.7 : The frequency response of the second-order 520 Hz high-pass ﬁ lter 

Filters 191
the filter output is falling. The important factor is the dielectric, not the voltage rating; 
63 V polypropylene capacitors are also free from distortion. The only downside is that 
polypropylene capacitors are larger for a given CV product and more expensive.  
 Multiple-feedback bandpass ﬁ lters 
 When a bandpass filter of modest Q is required, the multiple-feedback or Rauch type 
shown in  Figure 6.9 has many advantages. The capacitors are equal and so can be made any 
preferred value. The opamp is working with shunt feedback and so has no common-mode 
voltage on the inputs, which avoids one source of distortion. It does however phase-invert, 
which can be inconvenient. 
 The filter response is defined by three parameters- the centre frequency f 0 , the Q, and the 
passband gain (i.e. the gain at the response peak) A. The filter in  Figure 6.8 was designed for 
f 0   250 Hz, Q  2, and A  1 using the equations given, and the usual awkward resistor 
values emerged. The resistors in  Figure 6.7 are the nearest E96 value, and the simulated 
results come out as f 0   251 Hz, Q  1.99, and A  1.0024, which, as they say, is good 
enough for rock’n’roll.

upper trace shows distortion from polyester capacitors; the lower trace, with polypropylene 
capacitors, shows noise only 

192 Chapter 6
 The Q of the filter can be quickly checked from the response curve as Q is equal to the 
centre frequency divided by the 3 dB bandwidth, i.e. the frequency difference between 
the two 3 dB points on either side of the peak. This configuration is not suitable for Qs 
greater than about 10, as the filter characteristics become unduly sensitive to component 
tolerances. If independent control of f 0  and Q are required the state-variable filter should be 
used instead. 
 Similar configurations can be used for low-pass and high-pass filters. The low-pass version 
does not depend on a low opamp output impedance to maintain stop-band attenuation at high 
frequencies, and avoids the ‘oh no, it’s coming back up again’ behaviour of Sallen and Key 
low-pass filters. 
 Notch ﬁ lters 
 There are many ways to dig a deep notch in your frequency response. The width of a notch 
is described by its Q; exactly as for a resonance peak, the Q is equal to the centre frequency 
divided by the 3 dB bandwidth, i.e. the frequency difference between the 3 dB points 
either side of the notch. The Q has no relation to the depth of the notch. 
 The best-known notch filter is the Twin-T notch network shown in Figure 6.10a, invented 
in 1934 by Herbert Augustadt [10]. The notch depth is infinite with exactly matched 
components, but with ordinary ones it is unlikely to be deeper than 40 dB. It requires ratios 
of two in component values which do not fit in well with preferred values, and when used 
alone has a Q of only ¼. It is therefore normally used with positive feedback via an opamp 
buffer A2, as shown. The proportion of feedback K and hence the Q-enhancement is set by 
R4 and R5, which here give a Q of 1. A great drawback is that the notch frequency can only 
be altered by changing three components, so it is not considered tuneable.  
 Figure 6.9 : A bandpass multiple-feedback ﬁ lter with f0  250 Hz, Q  2 and a gain of 1 

Filters 193
 Another way of making notch filters is the ‘1– bandpass’ principle mentioned earlier. The 
input goes through a bandpass filter, typically the multiple-feedback type described earlier, 
and is then subtracted from the original signal. The accuracy of the cancellation and hence the 
notch depth is critically dependent on the mid-band gain of the bandpass filter. Figure 6.10b 
shows an example that gives a notch at 50 Hz with a Q of 2.85. The subtraction is performed 
by A2; note the output of the filter is phase-inverted. The multiple-feedback filter is designed 
for unity passband gain, but the use of E24 values as shown means that the actual gain is 
0.97, limiting the notch depth to 32 dB. The value of R6 can be tweaked to deepen the 
notch; the nearest E96 value is 10.2 kΩ which gives a depth of 45 dB. The final output is 
inconveniently phase-inverted in the passband. 
 A notch filter that deserves to be better known is the Bainter filter [11], [12] shown in 
Figure 6.10c. It is non-inverting in the passband, and two out of three opamps are working 
at virtual earth and will give no trouble with common-mode distortion. An important 
advantage is that the notch depth does not depend on the matching of components, but only 
on the open-loop gain of the opamps, being roughly proportional to it. With TL072-type 
opamps the depth is from 40 to 50 dB. The values shown give a notch at 700 Hz with a 
Q of 1.29. The design equations can be found in reference [12]. 
 A property of this filter that does not seem to appear in the textbooks is that if R1 and R4 are 
altered together, i.e. having the same values, then the notch frequency is tuneable with a good 
 Figure 6.10 : Notch ﬁ lters: a) Twin-T with positive feedback, notch at 795 Hz and a Q of 1, 
b) ‘1-bandpass’ ﬁ lter with notch at 50 Hz, Q of 2.85, c) Bainter ﬁ lter with notch at 700 Hz, Q of 
1.29, d) Bridged-differentiator notch ﬁ lter tuneable 80 to 180 Hz 

194 Chapter 6
depth maintained, but the Q does change proportionally to frequency. To get a standard notch 
with equal gain either side of the crevasse, R3 must equal R4. R4 greater than R3 gives a low-
pass notch, while R3 greater than R4 gives a high-pass notch; these responses are useful in 
crossover design [7]. 
 The Bainter filter is usually shown with equal values for C1 and C2. This leads to values for 
R5 and R6 that are a good deal higher than other circuit resistances and this will impair the 
noise performance. I suggest that C2 is made ten times C1, i.e. 100 nF, and R5 and R6 are 
reduced by ten times to 5.1 kΩ and 6.8 kΩ; the response is unaltered and the Johnson noise 
much reduced. 
 But what about a notch filter that can be tuned with one control?  Figure 6.10 d shows a 
bridged-differentiator notch filter tuneable from 80 to 180 Hz by RV1. R3 must theoretically 
be six times the total resistance between A and B, which here is 138 kΩ, but 139 kΩ gives 
a deeper notch, about 27 dB across the tuning range. The downside is that Q varies with 
frequency from 3.9 at 80 Hz to 1.4 at 180 Hz. 
 Another interesting notch filter to look up is the Boctor, which uses only one opamp [13], 
[14]. Both the bi-quad and state-variable filters can be configured to give notch outputs. 
 When simulating notch filters, assessing the notch depth can be tricky. You need a lot of 
frequency steps to ensure you really have hit bottom with one of them. For example, in one 
run, 50 steps/decade showed a 20 dB notch, but upping it to 500 steps/decade revealed it 
was really 31 dB deep. In most cases, having a stupendously deep notch is pointless. If 
you are trying to remove an unwanted signal then it only has to alter in frequency by a tiny 
amount and you are on the side of the notch rather than the bottom and the attenuation is 
much reduced. The exception to this is the THD analyser, where a very deep notch (120 dB or 
more) is needed to reject the fundamental so very low levels of harmonics can be measured. 
This is achieved by continuously servo-tuning the notch so it is kept exactly on the incoming 
frequency. 
 Differential ﬁ lters 
 At first an active filter that is also a differential amplifier, and thereby carries out an accurate 
subtraction, sounds like a very exotic creature. Actually they are quite common, and are 
normally based on the multiple-feedback filter described above. Their main application is 
DAC output filtering in CD payers and the like; more sophisticated versions are useful for 
data acquisition in difficult environments. Differential filters are dealt with in the section of 
Chapter 26 on interfacing with DAC outputs.

 Preampliﬁ er architectures 
 Some sort of preamplifier or control unit is required in all hifi systems, even if its only 
function is to select the source and set the volume. You could even argue that the source-
selection switch could be done away with, if you are prepared to plug and unplug those 
rhodium-plated connectors, leaving a ‘preamplifier’ that basically consists solely of a volume 
control potentiometer in a box. Mind you don’t catch your sackcloth on those heatsink 
corners, and try to keep the ashes away from the turntable. 
 I am assuming here that a selector switch will be required, and that gives us the ‘passive 
preamplifier’ (oxymoron alert!) in   Figure 7.1 a. 
 Passive preampliﬁ ers 
 A device may have only one component but it does not follow that it is easy to design, 
even though the only parameter to decide is the resistance of the volume pot. Any piece of 
equipment that embodies its internal contradictions in its very name need to be treated with 
caution. The pot resistance of a ‘passive preamplifier’ cannot be too high because the output 
impedance, maximal at one quarter the track resistance when volume is set to 6 dB, will 
cause an HF roll-off in conjunction with the connecting cable capacitance. It also makes 
life difficult for those designing RF filters on the inputs of the equipment being driven, as 
described in  Chapter 18 . 
 On the other hand, if the volume pot resistance is too low the source equipment will suffer 
excessive loading. If the source is valve equipment, which does not respond well to even 
moderate loading, the problem starts to look insoluble. 
 If however, we can assume that our source equipment has a reasonable drive capability, we 
can use a 10 kΩ pot. Its maximum output impedance (at 6 dB) will then be 2.5 kΩ. The 
capacitance of most audio cable is 50–150 pF/metre, so with a 2.5 kΩ source impedance and 
100 pF/metre cable, a maximum length of 5 metres is permissible before the HF loss hits 
the magic figure of 0.1 dB at 20 kHz. A very rapid survey of ‘passive preamplifiers’ in 
2009 confirmed that 10 kΩ seems to be the most popular value. One model had a 20 kΩ 
potentiometer, and another had a 100 kΩ pot, which with its 25 kΩ source impedance would

hardly allow any cable at all. I suspect that the only reason such a pot can appear acceptable 
is because in normal use it is set well below 6 dB. For example, if a 100 kΩ pot is set 
to 15 dB, the output impedance is reduced to 14 kΩ, which would allow just under a metre 
of 100 pF/metre cable to be used with HF loss still limited to 0.1 dB at 20 kHz. A high 
output impedance also makes an interconnection more susceptible to interference unless it is 
totally screened at every point on its length. 
 Consider also that many power amplifiers have RC filters at the input, not so much for 
EMC immunity, but more as a gesture against what used to be called ‘TID’ but is actually 
just old-fashioned slew-limiting and highly unlikely in practice. These can add extra 
shunt capacitance to the input ranging from 100 pF to 1000 pF, apparently having been 
designed on the assumption of near-zero source impedance, and this can cause serious 
HF roll-offs. 
 There is at least one passive preamplifier on the market that controls volume by changing the 
taps on the secondary of a transformer; this should give much lower output impedances. There 
is more on this approach in  Chapter 13 on volume controls. 
 Active preampliﬁ ers 
 Once we permit ourselves active electronics, things get much easier. If a unity-gain buffer 
stage is added after the selector switch, as in  Figure 7.1 b, the volume pot resistance can be 
reduced to much less than 10 kΩ, while presenting a high impedance to the sources. If a 5532 
is used there is no technical reason why the pot could not be as low as 1 kΩ, which will give 
a much more useable maximum output impedance of only 250 Ω, and also reduce Johnson 
noise by 10 dB. A phono preamplifier has also been added. Now we’ve paid for a power 
supply, it might as well supply something else. 
 This still leaves us with an ‘amplifier’ that has only unity line gain. Normally only CD 
players, which have an output of 2 Vrms, can fully drive a power amplifier without 
additional gain, and there are some high-power amplifiers that require more than this for 
full output. iPods appear to have a maximum output of 1.2 Vrms. Output levels for tuners, 
phono amps and so on vary but may be as low as 150 mVrms, while power amplifiers 
rarely have sensitivities lower than 500 mV. Clearly some gain would be a good thing, so 
one option is adding a gain stage after the volume control as in  Figure 7.1 c. The output 
level can be increased and the output impedance kept down to 100 Ω or lower. 
 This amplifier stage introduces its own difficulties. If its nominal output level with the 
volume control fully up is taken as 1 V rms for 150 mV in, which will let us drive most power 
amps to full output from most sources most of the time, we will need a gain of 6.7 times or 
16.5 dB. If we decide to increase the nominal output level to 2 Vrms, to be sure of driving 

200 Chapter 7
most if not all exotica to its limits, we need 22.5 dB. The problem is that the gain stage is 
amplifying its own noise at all volume settings, and amplifying a proportion of the Johnson 
noise of the pot whenever the wiper is off the zero stop. The noise performance will therefore 
deteriorate markedly at low volume levels, which are the ones most used. 
 Ampliﬁ cation and the gain-distribution problem 
 One answer to this difficulty is to take the total gain and split it so there is some before 
and some after the volume control, so there is less gain amplifying the noise at low volume 
settings. One version of this is shown in Figure 7.1d. The question is – how much gain 
before, and how much after? This is inevitably a compromise, and it might be called the gain-
distribution problem. Putting more of the total gain before the volume control reduces the 
headroom as there is no way to reduce the signal level, while putting more after increases the 
noise output at low volume settings. 
 If you are exclusively using sources with a predictable output, of which the 2 Vrms from a 
CD player will be the maximum, the overload situation is well-defined, and if we assume 
that the pre-volume gain stage is capable of at least 8 Vrms out, so long as the pre-volume 
control gain is less than four times, there will never be a clipping problem. However, phono 
cartridges, particularly moving coil ones, which have a very wide range of sensitivities, 
produce much less predictable outputs after fixed-gain preamplification, and it is a judgement 
call as to how much safety margin is desirable. 
 As an aside, it’s worth bearing in mind that even putting a unity-gain buffer before the 
volume control, which we did as the first step in preamp evolution, does place a constraint 
on the signal levels that can be handled, albeit at rather a high level of 8 to 10 Vrms 
depending on the supply rails in use. The only source likely to be capable of putting out 
such levels is a mixing console with the group faders fully advanced. There is also the 
ultimate constraint that a volume control pot can only handle so much power, and the 
manufacturers’ ratings are surprisingly low, sometimes only 50 mW. This means that a 
10 kΩ pot would be limited to 22 Vrms across it, and if you are planning to use lower 
resistance pots than this to reduce noise, their power rating needs to be kept very much 
in mind. 
 Whenever a compromise appears in engineering, you can bet that someone will try to find a 
way round it and get the best of both worlds. What can be done about the gain-distribution 
dilemma? 
 One possibility is the use of a special low-noise amplifier after the volume control, 
combined with a low resistance volume pot as suggested above. This could be done either by 
a discrete-device and opamp hybrid stage, or by using a multiple opamp array, as described 

Preampliﬁ er architectures 201
in  Chapter 1 . It is doubtful if it is possible to obtain more than a 10 dB noise improvement 
by these means, but it would be an interesting project. 
 Another possible solution is the use of double gain controls. There is an input-gain control 
before any amplification stage which is used to set the internal level appropriately, thus 
avoiding overload, and after the active stages there is an output volume control, which gives 
the much-desired silence at zero volume (see   Figure 7.2 a). The input gain controls can be 
separate for each channel, so they double as a balance facility; this approach was used on the 
Figure 7.2: More preamp architectures: a) with input gain control and output volume control, b) with 
recording output and return input, and an active gain-control

202 Chapter 7
Radford HD250 amplifier, and also in one of my early preamplifier designs [1]. This helps 
to offset the cost of the extra pot. However, having two gain controls is operationally rather 
awkward, and however attenuation and fixed amplification are arranged, there are always 
going to be some tradeoffs between noise and headroom. It could also be argued that this 
scheme does not make a lot of sense unless some means of metering the signal level after the 
input gain control is provided, so it can be set appropriately. 
 If the input and output gain controls are ganged together, to improve ease of operation at the 
expense of flexibility, this is sometimes called a distributed gain control. 
 Active gain controls 
 The noise/headroom compromise is completely avoided by replacing the combination of 
volume-control-and-amplifier with an active gain control, i.e. an amplifier stage whose gain 
is variable from near-zero to the required maximum (see Figure 7.2b). We get lower noise 
at gain settings below maximum, and we can increase that maximum gain so even the least 
sensitive power amplifiers can be fully driven, without impairing the noise performance at 
lower settings. We also get the ability to generate a quasi-logarithmic law from a linear pot, 
which gives excellent channel balance as it depends only on mechanical alignment. The only 
snags are that: 
 •  most active gain controls phase-invert, though this can be corrected by suitable 
connection of a balanced input or balanced output stage, or a Baxandall tone control; 
 •  the noise out is very low but not zero at zero volume as it would be with a passive pot 
since the noise  gain does not fall below unity. 
 The technology of active gain controls is dealt with fully in  Chapter 13 . 
 Recording facilities 
 If a preamplifier is going to be used for recording the minimum requirement is an output taken 
from before the volume control, and there is usually also a dedicated input for a signal coming 
back from the recorder which can be switched to for checking purposes. Back when recording 
was done on tape, the return signal could be taken from the replay heads and gave assurance 
that recording had actually happened. Now that recording is done on hard disk machines or 
PCs the return signal normally only assures you that the signal has actually got there and back. 
 Much ingenuity used to be expended in designing switching systems so you could listen to 
one source while recording another, though it is rather doubtful how many people actually 
want to do this; it demands very high standards of crosstalk inside the preamplifier to make 
sure that the signal being recorded is not contaminated by another source. 

Preampliﬁ er architectures 203
 Tone controls 
 Let us now consider adding tone controls. They have been unfashionable for a while, but this 
is definitely changing now. I think they are absolutely necessary, and it is a startling situation 
when, as frequently happens, anxious inquirers to hifi advice columns are advised to change 
their loudspeakers to correct excess or lack of bass or treble. This is an extremely expensive 
alternative to tone controls. 
 There are many possible types, as described in  Chapter 15 , but one thing they have in 
common is that they must be fed from a low-impedance source to give the correct boost/
cut figures and predictable EQ curves. Another vital point is that most types, including the 
famous Baxandall configuration, phase-invert. Since there is now pretty much a consensus 
that all audio equipment should maintain absolute phase polarity for all input and outputs, 
this can be highly inconvenient. 
 However, as noted above, this phase inversion can very neatly be undone by the use of 
an active gain control, which also uses shunt feedback and so also phase-inverts. The 
tone-control can be placed before or after the active gain control, but if placed afterwards 
it generates noise that cannot be turned down. Putting it before the active gain control 
reduces headroom if boost is in use, but if we assume the maximum boost used is 10 dB, 
the tone-control will not clip until an input of 3 Vrms is applied, and domestic equipment 
rarely generates such levels. It therefore seems best to put the tone control before the active 
gain control. This is what I did in my most recent preamplifier designs [2], [3], [4], [5].

 Moving-magnet inputs: 
levels and RIAA equalisation 
 Cartridge types 
 This chapter and those following deal with the design of preamplifiers to accept moving-
magnet (MM) cartridge inputs, with their special loading requirements and need for RIAA 
equalisation. MM cartridges have been for many years less popular than moving coil (MC) 
cartridges (their preamps have their own chapter), but seem to be staging a comeback. 
However it would be unusual nowadays to design a phono input that accepted MM inputs 
only. There are several ways to design a combined MM/MC input, but the approach that gives 
the best results is to design an MM preamp that incorporates the RIAA equalisation, and put 
a flat-response low-noise head amplifier in front of it to get MC inputs up to MM levels. A 
large part of this chapter is devoted to the tricky business of RIAA equalisation, and so is 
equally relevant to MC input design. Almost all modern cartridges are of these two types, 
though Grado make a moving-iron (MI) series; this is essentially a variation on MM. 
 Ceramic cartridges were still very much around when I first got into the audio business, but 
they now seem to be a rare example of an obsolete audio technology that no one wants to 
revive. Ceramic cartridges have elements of Rochelle salt (in early versions, often called 
crystal pickups) or PZT (in ceramic versions) which generate electricity when flexed by the 
stylus. They look like a pure capacitance of around 200 pF to an amplifier input, and given 
a suitably high-impedance load, greater than 2 MΩ, they respond to stylus displacement 
rather than velocity. This led people to say that RIAA equalisation was not required, though 
this seems to overlook the presence of the 2-octave plateau in the middle of the RIAA 
characteristic. With 2 MΩ loading the output was in the range 200–600 mVrms, much 
higher than the output of MM cartridges. This did not necessarily simplify preamplifier 
circuitry because of the need to establish a 2 MΩ input impedance; there is no real difficulty 
in doing this even with low-beta BJTs, as described in  Chapter 3 , but a few more parts are 
needed. Alternatively the cartridge can be more heavily loaded and equalisation applied. 
More on the two philosophies of ceramic cartridge termination can be found in a 1969 
article by Linsley-Hood [1] and there was a thorough discussion of the whole business by 
Burrows in 1970 [2], [3]. 

206 Chapter 8
 The tracking force for ceramic cartridges is usually higher than that of MM or MC, often 
being on the order of 3 to 5 grams, and the increased groove wear is one powerful reason for 
not using them today. Sonotone and Acos were major ceramic cartridge manufacturers. The 
first cartridge I ever owned was a Sonotone 9TA; I still have it. Like most of its kind, it was 
a turnover cartridge; in other words there were two styli, one on each side of the cantilever. 
One was for microgroove LPs and the other for coarse-groove 78s, and they were selected 
by turning over the cantilever with a little plastic tab. This type of cartridge is still sometimes 
used for transcribing old 78 rpm records. An excellent account of the history of Sonotone 
cartridges can be found in [4]. 
 Strain-gauge cartridges also have a long history, and are still with us today. Those made by 
Sound-Smith [5] appear to have a good reputation, though I have no experience with them 
myself. They are also sensitive to stylus displacement, rather than stylus velocity (as MM and 
MC cartridges are). Naturally they require a specialised preamplifier, and the whole set-up is 
not cheap. 
 Capacitance pickups, aka ‘FM pickups’ or ‘electrostatic pickups’ consist of a small capacitor, 
one plate of which is wiggled by the stylus; the change in capacitance frequency-modulates 
an oscillator and the signal is decoded by standard FM-receiver technology. These were 
made by Weathers; the relevant patent appears to be US 4,489,278 granted to Paul Weathers 
in 1984. Stax also made them – their first capacitance cartridge was the mono CP-20 
introduced in 1952, the stereo CPS-40 not appearing until 1962. In 1977, Stax introduced a 
new technology, the CP-Y cartridge having a permanent electret element and a head-amplifier 
IC built into the cartridge body. Shortly afterwards, their FM system was discontinued. 
 The vinyl medium 
 The vinyl disc as a medium for music delivery in its present form dates back to 1948 when 
Columbia introduced microgroove 33⅓ rpm LP records. These were followed soon after by 
microgroove 45 rpm records from RCA Victor. Stereo vinyl did not appear until 1958. The 
introduction of Varigroove technology, which adjusts groove spacing to suit the amplitude of 
the groove vibrations, using an extra look-ahead tape head to see what the future holds, allowed 
increases in groove packing density. This density rarely exceeded 100 grooves per inch in the 
78 rpm format, but with Varigroove 180 to 360 grooves/inch could be used at 33⅓ rpm. 
 While microgroove technology was unquestionably a considerable improvement on 78 rpm 
records, any technology that is 60 years old is likely to show definite limitations compared 
with contemporary standards, and indeed it does. Compared with modern digital formats, 
vinyl has a restricted dynamic range, poor linearity (especially at the end of a side) and is 
very vulnerable to permanent and irritating damage in the form of scratches. Even with the 
greatest care, scratches are likely to be inflicted when the record is removed from its sleeve. 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 207
This action also generates significant static charges which attract dust and lint to the record 
surface. If not carefully removed this dirt builds up on the stylus and not only degrades the 
reproduction of high-frequency information today, but may also damage it in the future if it 
provokes mistracking. 
 Vinyl discs do not shatter under impact like the 78 shellac discs, but they are subject to warping 
by heat, improper storage, or poor manufacturing quality control. Possibly the worst feature 
of vinyl is that the stored material is degraded every time the disc is played, as the delicate 
high-frequency groove modulations are worn away by the stylus. When a good turntable with 
a properly balanced tone arm and correctly set-up low-mass stylus is used this wear process is 
relatively slow, but it nevertheless proceeds inexorably. The stylus suffers wear too. 
 However, for reasons that have very little to do with logic or common-sense, vinyl is still very 
much alive. Even if it is accepted that as a music-delivery medium it is technically as obsolete 
as wax cylinders, there remain many sizable album collections that it is impractical to replace 
with CDs and would take an interminable time to transfer to the digital domain. I have one 
of them. Disc inputs must therefore remain part of the audio designer’s repertoire for the 
foreseeable future, and the design of the specialised electronics to get the best from the vinyl 
medium is still very relevant. 
 Spurious signals 
 It is not easy to find dependable statistics on the dynamic range of vinyl, but there seems to 
be general agreement that it is in the range 50 to 80 dB, the 50 dB coming from the standard 
quality discs, and the 80 dB representing direct-cut discs produced with quality as the prime 
aim. My own view is that 80 dB is rather optimistic. 
 The most audible spurious noise coming from vinyl is that in the mid frequencies, stemming 
from the inescapable fact that the music is read by a stylus sliding along a groove of finite 
smoothness. There is nothing that the designer of audio electronics can do about this. 
Scratches create clicks that have a large high-frequency content, and it has been shown that 
they can easily exceed the level of the audio [6]. It is important that such clicks do not cause 
clipping or slew-limiting, as this makes their subjective impact worse. 
 The signal from a record deck also includes copious amounts of low-frequency noise, which 
is often called rumble; it is typically below 30 Hz. This can come from several sources: 
1.  Mechanical noise generated by the motor bearings and picked up by the stylus/
arm combination. These tend to be at the upper end of the low-frequency domain, 
extending up to 30 Hz or thereabouts. This is a matter for the mechanical designer of 
the turntable, as it clearly cannot be filtered out without removing the lower part of the 
audio spectrum. 

208 Chapter 8
2.  Room vibrations will be picked up if the turntable and arm system is not well isolated 
from the floor. This is a particular problem in older houses where the wooden floors 
are not built to modern standards of rigidity, and have a perceptible bounce to them. 
Mounting the turntable shelf on the wall usually gives a major improvement; subsonic 
filtering is effective in removing room vibration. 
3.  Low frequency noise from disc imperfections. This is the worst cause of disturbances. 
They can extend as low as 0.55 Hz, the frequency at which a 33⅓ rpm disc rotates on 
the turntable, and is due to large-scale disc warps. Warping can also produce ripples 
in the surface, generating spurious subsonic signals up to a few Hertz at surprisingly 
high levels. These can be further amplified by a poorly controlled resonance of the 
cartridge compliance and the pickup arm mass. When woofer speaker cones can be 
seen wobbling – and bass reflex designs with no cone loading at very low frequencies 
are the worst for this – disc warps are usually the cause. Subsonic filtering is again 
effective in removing this. 
 (As an aside, I have heard it convincingly argued that bass reflex designs have only achieved 
their current popularity because of the advent of the CD player, with its greater bass signal 
extension but lack of subsonic output.) 
 Some fascinating data on the subsonic output from vinyl was given by Tomlinson Holman in 
[7] which show that the highest warp signals occur in the 2 to 4 Hz region, being some 8 dB 
less at 10 Hz. By matching these signals with a wide variety of cartridge-arm combinations, he 
concluded that to accommodate the very worst cases, a preamplifier should be able to accept 
not less than 35 mVrms in the 3–4 Hz region. This is a rather demanding requirement, driven by 
some truly diabolical cartridge-arm setups that accentuated subsonic frequencies by up to 24 dB. 
 Since the subsonic content generated by room vibrations and disc imperfections tends to cause 
vertical movements of the stylus, the resulting electrical output will be out of phase in the left 
and right channels. The use of a central mono subwoofer system that sums the two channels 
will provide partial cancellation, reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced. It is, 
however, still important to ensure that subsonic signals do not reach the left and right speakers. 
 Other problems with vinyl 
 The reproduction of vinyl involves other difficulties apart from the spurious signals 
mentioned above: 
 •  Distortion is a major problem. It is pretty obvious that the electromechanical processes 
involved are not going to be as linear as we now expect our electronic circuitry to be. 
Moving-magnet and moving-coil cartridges add their own distortion, which can reach 
1 to 5% at high levels. 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 209
 •  Distortion gets worse as the stylus moves from the outside to the inside of the disc. 
This is called ‘end of side distortion’ because it can be painfully obvious in the 
final track. It occurs because the modulation of the inner grooves is inevitably more 
compressed than those of the outer tracks, due to the constant rotational speed of 
a turntable. I can well recall buying albums, and discovering to my chagrin that a 
favourite track was the last on a side. 
 •  It is a notable limitation of the vinyl process that the geometry of the recording machine 
and that of the replay turntable do not match. The original recordings are cut on a lathe 
where the cutting head moves in a radial straight line across the disc. In contrast, almost 
all turntables have a pivoting tone arm about 9 inches in length. The pickup head is angled 
to reduce the mismatch between the recoding and reply situations, but this introduces side 
forces on the stylus and various other problems, increasing the distortion of the playback 
signal. A recent article in  Stereophile [8] shows just how complicated the business of tone 
arm geometry is. SME produced a 12-inch arm to reduce the angular errors – I have one 
and it is a thing of great beauty, but I must admit I have never put it to use. 
 •  The vinyl process depends on a stylus faithfully tracking a groove. If the groove 
modulation is excessive, with respect to the capabilities of the cartridge/arm 
combination, the stylus loses contact with the groove walls and rattles about a bit. This 
obviously introduces gross distortion, and is also very likely to damage the groove. 
 •  A really disabling problem is ‘wow’ – the cyclic pitch change resulting from an off-
centre hole. Particularly bad examples of this used to be called ‘swingers’ because they 
were so eccentric that they could be visibly seen to be rotating off-centre. I understand 
that nowadays the term means something entirely different, and relates to an activity 
which sounds as though it could only be a distraction from critical listening. 
 Maximum signal levels on vinyl 
 There are limits to the signal level possible on a vinyl disc, and they impose maxima on the 
signal that a cartridge and its associated electronics will be expected to reproduce. The exact 
values of these limits may not be precisely defined, but the way they work sets the ways in 
which maximum levels vary with frequency, and this is of great importance. 
 There are no variable gain controls on RIAA inputs, because implementing an uneven but 
very precisely controlled frequency response and a suitably good noise performance are 
quite hard enough without adding variable gain as a feature. No doubt it could be done, but it 
would not be easy, and the general consensus is that it is not necessary. The overload margin, 
or headroom, is therefore of considerable importance, and it is very much a case of the more 
the merrier when it comes to the numbers game of ‘specmanship’. The issue can get a bit 
involved, as a situation with frequency-dependant vinyl limitations and frequency-dependant 

210 Chapter 8
gain is often further complicated by a heavy frequency-dependant load in the shape of the 
feedback network, which can put its own limit on amplifier output at high frequencies. Let us 
first look at the limits on the signal levels which stylus-in-vinyl technology can deliver. In the 
diagrams above the response curves have been simplified to the straight-line asymptotes. 
 Figure 8.1a shows the physical groove amplitudes that can be put onto a disc. From subsonic 
up to about 1 kHz, groove amplitude is the constraint. If the sideways excursion is too great, 
the groove spacing will need to be increased to prevent one groove breaking into another, and 
playing time will be reduced. Well before actual breakthrough occurs, the cutter can distort 
the groove it has cut on the previous revolution, leading to ‘pre-echo’ in quiet sections, where 
a faint version of the music you are about to hear is produced. Time travel may be fine in 
science fiction but it does not enhance the musical experience. The ultimate limit to groove 
amplitude is set by mechanical stops in the cutter head. 
 There is an extra limitation on groove amplitude: out-of-phase signals cause vertical 
motion of the cutter, and if this becomes excessive it can cause it to cut either too deeply 
into the disc medium and dig into the aluminium substrate, or lose contact with the disc 
altogether; an excessive vertical component can also upset the playback process, especially 
when low tracking forces are used – in the worst case the stylus can be thrown out of the 
groove completely. To control this problem, the stereo signal is passed through a matrix that 
isolates the L-R vertical signal, which is then amplitude limited. This potentially reduces the 
perceived stereo separation at low frequencies, but there appears to be a general consensus 
that the effect is not audible. The most important factor in controlling out-of-phase signals is

the panning of bass instruments (which create the largest cutter amplitudes) to the centre of 
the stereo stage. This approach is still advantageous with digital media as it means that there 
are two channels of amplification to reproduce the bass information rather than one. 
 From about 1 kHz up to the ultrasonic regions, the limit is groove velocity rather than 
amplitude. If the disc cutter head tries to move sideways too quickly compared with its 
relative forward motion, the back facets of the cutter destroy the groove that has just been cut 
by its forward edges. 
 On disc replay, there is a third restriction – that of stylus acceleration, or to put it another 
way, groove curvature. This sets a limit on how well a stylus of a given size and shape 
can track the groove. Allowing for this at cutting time places an extra limitation on signal 
level, shown by the dotted line in  Figure 8.1a . The severity of this restriction depends on 
the stylus shape; an old-fashioned spherical type with a tip diameter of 0.7 mil requires 
a roll-off of maximum levels from 2 kHz, while a (relatively) modern elliptical type with 
0.2 mil effective diameter postpones the problem to about 8 kHz. The limit however still 
remains. 
 Thus disc-cutting and playback technology put at least three limits on the maximum signal 
level. This is not as bad a problem as it might be, because the distribution of amplitude with 
frequency for music is not flat with frequency; there is always more energy at LF than HF. 
This is especially true of the regrettable phenomenon known as rap music. For some reason 
there seems to be very little literature on the distribution of musical energy versus frequency, 
but a very rough rule is that levels can be expected to be fairly constant up to 1 kHz and then 
fall by something like 10 dB/octave. The end result is that despite the limits on disc levels 
at HF, it is still possible to apply a considerable amount of HF boost which, when undone 
at replay, reduces surface noise problems. At the same time the LF levels are cut to keep 
groove amplitude under control. Both functions are implemented by applying the inverse of 
the familiar RIAA replay equalisation at cutting time. More on the limitations affecting vinyl 
levels can be found on Jim Lesurf’s website [9]. 
 A reaction to the limitations of the usual seven-inch single was the twelve-inch single, which 
appeared in the mid-1970s, before CDs arrived. The much greater playing area allowed 
greater groove spacing and higher recording levels. I bought several of these, in the 45 rpm 
format, and I can testify that the greater groove speed gave a much clearer and less distorted 
high end, definitely superior to 33 rpm LPs. 
 Having looked at the limitations on the signal levels put onto disc, we need to see what will 
get back when we replay it. This obviously depends on the cartridge sensitivity. That issue is 
dealt with in the next section, but it might as well be said now that, in general, MM cartridge 
sensitivity varies over a limited range of about 7 dB, while MC sensitivity variation is much 
greater. 

212 Chapter 8
 Since MM input stages do not normally have gain controls, it is important that they can 
accept the whole range of input levels that occur. A well-known paper by Tomlinson 
Holman [10] quotes a worst-case peak voltage from an MM cartridge of 135 mV 
at 1 kHz given by [11]. This is equivalent to 95 mVrms at 1 kHz. He says, ‘this is a 
genuinely worst-case combination which is not expected to be approached typically in 
practice.’ 
 Shure are a well-known manufacturer of MM cartridges, and their flagship V15 phonograph 
cartridge series, (the 15 in each model name referred to the cartridges’ 15-degree tracking 
angle) for many years set the standard for low tracking force and high tracking ability. 
Its development necessitated much research into the maximum levels on vinyl. Many 
other workers also contributed in this field. The results are usually expressed in velocity 
(cm/s) as this eliminates the effect of cartridge sensitivity. I have boiled down the Shure 
velocity data into  Table 8.1 . I have included the acceleration of the stylus tip required for 
the various frequency/velocity pairs; this is not of direct use, but given that the maximum 
sustained acceleration the human body can withstand with is around 3 g, it surely makes 
you think. Since the highest MM cartridge sensitivity for normal use is 1.6 mV per cm/s 
(see next section),  Table 8.1 tells us that we need to be able to handle an MM input of 
1.6  38  61 mVrms. This is not far out of line with the 95 mVrms quoted by Holman, 
being only 3.8 dB lower.

 The website of Jim Lesurf [12] has many contemporary measurements of maximum 
groove velocities. The maximum quoted is 39.7 cm/s, which gives 1.6  39.7  
63.5 mVrms. Rooting through the literature, the Pressure Cooker discs by Sheffield Labs 
were recorded direct to disc and are said to contain velocities up to 40 cm/s, giving us 
1.6  40  64 mVrms. It is reassuring that these maxima do not differ very much. On the 
other hand, the jazz record  Hey! Heard The Herd by Woody Herman (Verve V/V6 8558, 
1953) is said to peak at a velocity of 104 cm/s at 7.25 kHz, [13] but this seems out of line 
with all other data. If it is true, the input level from the most sensitive cartridge would be 
1.6  105  166 mVrms. 
 So we may conclude that the greatest input level we are likely to encounter is 64 mVrms, 
though that 166 mVrms should perhaps not be entirely forgotten. 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 213
 The maximum input a stage can accept before output clipping is set by its gain and supply 
rails. If we are using normal opamps powered from ±17 V rails, we can assume an output 
capability of 10 Vrms. Scaling this down by the gain in each case gives us  Table 8.2 which 
also shows the output level from a nominal 5 Vrms input. You will see shortly why the odd 
gain value of 45.5 dB was used. 
 Clearly if we want to accept a 64 mVrms input the gain cannot much exceed 40 dB. In fact 
a gain of 43.8 dB will just give clipping for 64 mVrms in. If we want to accept the Woody 
Herman 166 mVrms, then the maximum permissible gain is 35.6 dB. I would suggest that 
a safety margin of at least 5 dB should be added, so we conclude that 30 dB (1 kHz) is an 
appropriate gain for an MM input stage; this will accept 316 mVrms from a cartridge before 
clipping. A recent review of a valve phono stage [14] described an MM input capability 
of 300 mVrms as ‘extremely generous’, and I suggest that an input capability of around 
this figure will render you immune to overload for ever, and be more than adequate for 
the highest quality equipment. The stage output with a nominal 5 mVrms input is only 
158 mVrms, which is not enough to operate your average power amplifier, and so there will 
have to be another amplifying stage after it. This must have variable gain, or be preceded 
by a passive volume control, for otherwise it will clip before the first stage and reduce the 
overload margin. 
 While we must have a relatively low gain in the MM stage to give a good maximum signal 
capability, we do not want it to be too low, or the signal/noise ratio is likely to be degraded 
as the signal passes through later stages. It is one of the prime rules of audio that you should 
minimise the possibility of this by getting the signal up to a decent level as soon as possible, 
but it is common practice and very sensible for the MM output to go through a unity-gain 
subsonic filter before it receives any further amplification; this is because the subsonic stuff 
coming from the disc can be at disturbingly high levels.

214 Chapter 8
 In the history of preamplifiers MM input overload margin used to be a test of machismo – 
this is less true now as the changeover to MC cartridges with a wide range of output levels 
makes a single input overload figure much less meaningful. 
 Moving-magnet cartridge sensitivities 
 Having looked at the limitations on the signal levels put onto disc, we need to see what levels 
we will get back when we replay it. The level reaching the preamplifier is clearly proportional 
to the cartridge sensitivity. Due to their electromagnetic nature, MM cartridges respond to stylus 
velocity rather than displacement (the same applies to MC cartridges), so output voltage is 
usually specified at a velocity of 5 cm/sec. That convention is followed throughout this chapter. 
 A survey of 72 MM cartridges on the market in 2012 showed that they fall into two groups – 
what might be called normal hifi cartridges, (57 of them) and specialised cartridges for DJ 
use (15 of them). The DJ types have a significantly higher output than the normal cartridges – 
the Ortofon Q-Bert Concorde produces no less than 11 mV, the highest output I could find. 
It seems unlikely that the manufacturers are trying to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio in 
a DJ environment, so I imagine there is some sort of macho ‘my cartridge has more output 
than yours’ thing going on. Presumably DJ cartridges are also designed to be exceptionally 
mechanically robust. We will focus here on the normal cartridges, but to accommodate DJ 
types all you only really need to do is allow for 6 dB more input level to the preamplifier.  
 The outputs of the 57 normal cartridges at a velocity of 5 cm/sec are summarised in the 
histogram of  Figure 8.2 . The range is from 3.0 mV to 8.0 mV, with significant clumps 
around 4–5 mV and 6.5 mV. If we ignore the single 8.0 mV cartridge, the output range is 
Figure 8.2: The output voltages for 57 MM cartridges, excluding specialised DJ types

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 215
restricted to 3.0 to 6.5 mV, which is only 6.7 dB. This is a very small range compared with 
the very wide one shown by MC cartridges, and makes the design of a purely MM input a 
simpler matter. There is no need to provide different amplifier sensitivities as a 6.7 dB range 
can be easily accommodated by adjustment of a volume control later in the audio path. 
 Overload margins and ampliﬁ er limitations 
 The safety factor between a nominal 5 mVrms input and the clipping point may be described 
as either the input headroom in mVrms, or the ‘overload margin’ which is the dB ratio 
between the nominal 5 mVrms input and the maximum input.  Table 8.2 above shows that an 
MM stage with a 35 dB gain (1 kHz) gives an output of 280 mV, an input overload level of 
178 mVrms and an overload margin of 31 dB, which might be called very good. A 30 dB 
(1 kHz) stage gives a nominal 158 mV out, an input overload level of 316 mVrms, and an 
overload margin of 36 dB, which is definitely excellent, giving 10 dB more headroom. 
 The maximum input capability of an MM stage is not always defined by simple frequency-
independent clipping at its output. Things may be complicated by the stage output capability 
varying with frequency. An RIAA feedback network, particularly one designed with a 
relatively low impedance to reduce noise, presents a heavier load as frequency rises because 
the impedance of the capacitors falls. This heavy loading at HF was very often a major cause 
of distortion and headroom-limitation in discrete RIAA stages that had either common-
collector or emitter-follower output topologies with highly asymmetrical drive capabilities; 
for example, an NPN emitter-follower is much better at sourcing current than sinking it. 
With conventional discrete designs, the 20 kHz output capability, and thus the overload 
margin, was often reduced by 6 dB or even more. Replacing the emitter resistor of an 
emitter-follower with a current-source much reduces the problem, and the very slight extra 
complication of using a push-pull Class-A output structure can bring it down to negligible 
proportions (for more details see  Chapter 10  on discrete MM input design). Earlier opamps 
such as the TL072 also struggled to drive RIAA networks at HF, as well as giving a very 
poor noise performance. It was not until the advent of the 5532 opamp, with its excellent 
load-driving capabilities that the problem of driving low-impedance RIAA networks was 
solved; the noise performance was much better, too. However, if a low-impedance HF 
correction pole (more on this later) is being driven as well, there may still be some slight 
loss of output capability at 20 kHz. 
 Further headroom restrictions may occur when not all of the RIAA equalisation is 
implemented in one feedback loop. Putting the IEC Amendment roll-off after the preamplifier 
stage, as in  Figure 8.5 below, means that very low frequencies are amplified by 3 dB more 
at 20 Hz than they otherwise would be, and this is then undone by the later roll-off. This sort 
of audio impropriety always carries a penalty in headroom as the signal will clip before it is 

216 Chapter 8
attenuated, and the overload margin at 20 Hz is reduced by 3 dB. This effect reduces quickly 
as frequency increases, being 1.6 dB at 30 Hz and only 1 dB at 40 Hz. Whether this loss of 
overload margin is more important than providing an accurate IEC Amendment response is a 
judgement call, but in my experience it creates no trace of any problem in an MM stage with 
a gain of 30 dB (1 kHz). Passive-equalisation input architectures that put flat amplification 
before an RIAA stage suffer much more severely from this kind of headroom restriction, 
and it is quite common to encounter preamplifiers that claim to be high-end, with a high-end 
price-tag, but a very low-end overload margin of 20 to 22 dB. Bad show, chaps. 
 At any rate it is clear that we have to be careful not to unduly compromise the headroom 
at very low frequencies. We saw in the earlier section on spurious signals that Tomlinson 
Holman concluded that to accommodate the worst of the worst, a preamplifier should be able 
to accept not less than 35 mVrms in the 3–4 Hz region [7]. If the IEC Amendment is after the 
preamplifier stage, and C0 is made very large so it has no effect, the RIAA gain in the 2–5 Hz 
region has flattened out at 19.9 dB, implying that the equivalent overload level at 1 kHz will 
need to be 346 mVrms. The 30 dB (1 kHz) gain stage of   Figure 8.5 has a 1 kHz overload 
level of 316 mVrms, which is only 0.8 dB below this rather extreme criterion; we are good to 
go. Using a 35 dB (1 kHz) gain stage instead would significantly reduce the safety margins. 
 At the other end of the audio spectrum, adding an HF correction pole after the preamplifier, 
to correct the RIAA response with low gains, also introduces a compromise in the overload 
margin, though generally a much smaller one. The 30 dB (1 kHz) stage in   Figure 8.5 has a 
mid-band overload margin of 36 dB, which falls to 33 dB at 20 kHz. Only 0.4 dB of this 
is due to the amplify-then-attenuate action of the HF correction pole, the rest being due to 
the heavy capacitative loading on A1 of both the main RIAA feedback path and the pole-
correcting RC network. This slight compromise could be eliminated by using an opamp 
structure with greater load-driving capabilities, so long as it retains the low noise of a 5534A. 
 An attempt has been made to show these extra preamp limitations on output level in  Figure 8.1e 
above, and comparing 7.1d, it appears that in practice they are almost irrelevant because of the 
falloff in possible input levels at each end of the audio band. 
 To put all this into some sort of perspective, here are the 1 kHz overload margins for a few 
of my published designs. My first preamplifier, the Advanced Preamplifier [15], achieved 
39 dB in 1976, partly by using all-discrete design and ± 24 V supply rails. A later discrete 
design in 1979 [16] gave a tour de force 47 dB, accepting over 1.1 Vrms at 1 kHz, but I must 
confess this was showing off a bit and involved some quite complicated discrete circuitry, 
including the push-pull Class-A output stages mentioned in  Chapter 10 . Later designs such as 
the Precision Preamplifier [17] and its linear descendant the Precision Preamplifier ’96 [18] 
accepted the limitations of opamp output voltage in exchange for much greater convenience in 
most other directions, and still have an excellent overload margin of 36 dB. 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 217
 Equalisation and its discontents 
 Both moving-magnet and moving-coil cartridges operate by the relative motion of 
conductors and magnetic field, so the voltage produced is proportional to rate of change 
of flux. The cartridge is therefore sensitive to groove velocity rather than groove 
amplitude, and so its sensitivity is expressed as X mV per cm/sec. This velocity-
sensitivity gives a frequency response rising steadily at 6 dB/octave across the whole 
audio band for a groove of constant amplitude. Therefore a maximal signal on the disc, 
as in  Figure 8.1a , would give a cartridge output like  Figure 8.1b , which is simply 8.1a 
tilted upwards at 6 dB/octave. From here on the acceleration limits are omitted for 
greater clarity. 
 The RIAA replay equalisation curve is shown in  Figure 8.1c . It has three corners in its 
response curve, with frequencies at 50.05 Hz, 500.5 Hz, and 2.122 kHz, which are set by 
three time-constants of 3180 μs, 318 μs, and 75 μs. The RIAA curve was of USA origin but 
was adopted internationally with surprising speed, probably because everyone concerned was 
heartily sick of the ragbag of equalisation curves that existed previously (it became part of 
the IEC 98 standard, first published in 1964, and is now enshrined in IEC 60098, ‘Analogue 
Audio Disk Records and Reproducing Equipment’). 
 Note the flat shelf between 500 Hz and 2 kHz. It may occur to you that a constant downward 
slope across the audio band would have been simpler, required fewer precision components 
to accurately replicate, and would have saved us all a lot of trouble with the calculations. 
But such a response would require 60 dB more gain at 20 Hz than at 20 kHz, equivalent to 
1000 times. The minimum open-loop gain at 20 Hz would have to be 70 dB (3000 times) 
to allow even a minimal 10 dB of feedback at that frequency, and implementing that with a 
simple two-transistor preamplifier stage would have been difficult if not impossible (must 
try it sometime). The 500 Hz–2 kHz shelf in the RIAA curve reduces the 20 Hz–20 kHz gain 
difference by 12 dB to only 48 dB, making a one-valve or two-transistor preamplifier stage 
practical. One has to conclude that the people who established the RIAA curve knew what 
they were doing. 
 When the RIAA equalisation of  Figure 8.1c is applied to the cartridge output of  Figure 8.1b , 
the result looks like  Figure 8.1d , with the maximum amplitudes occurring around 1–2 kHz. 
This is in agreement with Holman’s data [7]. 
 Figure 8.1e shows some possible output level restrictions that may affect  Figure 8.1d . If 
the IEC Amendment is implemented after the first stage, there is a possibility of overload 
at low frequencies which does not exist if The Amendment is implemented in the 
feedback loop by restricting C0. At the high end, the output may be limited by problems 
driving the RIAA feedback network which falls in impedance as frequency rises (there is 
more on this later). 

218 Chapter 8
 The unloved IEC Amendment 
 Figure 8.1c shows in dotted lines an extra response corner at 20.02 Hz, corresponding to 
a time-constant of 7950 μs. This extra roll-off is called the ‘IEC Amendment’ and it was 
added to what was then IEC 98 in 1976. Its apparent intention was to reduce the subsonic 
output from the preamplifier, but its introduction is something of a mystery. It was certainly 
not asked for by either equipment manufacturers or their customers, and it was unpopular 
with both, with some manufacturers simply refusing to implement it. It still attracts negative 
comments today. The likeliest explanation seems to be that several noise reduction systems, 
for example dbx, were being introduced for use with vinyl at the time and their operation was 
badly affected by subsonic disturbances. None of these systems caught on. 
 On one hand it was pointed out that as an anti-rumble measure it was ineffective, as its slow 
first-order roll-off meant that the extra attenuation at 13 Hz, a typical cartridge-arm resonance 
frequency, was a feeble 5.3 dB; however at 4 Hz, a typical disc warp frequency, it did give 
a somewhat more useful 14.2 dB, reducing the unwanted frequencies to a quarter of their 
original amplitude. On the other hand there were loud complaints that the extra unwanted 
replay time constant caused significant frequency response errors at the low end of the audio 
band, namely 3.0 dB at 20 Hz and 1.0 dB at 40 Hz. Some of the more sophisticated 
equipment allows the Amendment to be switched in or out; a current example is the Audiolab 
8000PPA phono preamplifier. 
 The ‘Neumann pole’ 
 The RIAA curve is only defined to 20 kHz, but by implication carries on down at 6 dB/octave 
forever. This implies a recording characteristic rising at 6 dB/octave forever, which could 
clearly endanger the cutting head if ultrasonic signals were allowed through. From 1995 a 
belief began to circulate that record lathes incorporated an extra unofficial pole at 3.18 μs 
(50.0 kHz) to limit HF gain. This would cause a loss of 0.17 dB at 10 kHz and 0.64 dB at 
20 kHz, and would require compensation if an accurate replay response was to be obtained. 
The name of Neumann became attached to this concept simply because they are the best-
known manufacturers of record lathes. 
 The main problem with this story is that it is not true. The most popular cutting amplifier is 
the Neumann SAL 74B which has no such pole. For protection against ultrasonics and RF 
it has instead a rather more effective second-order low-pass filter with a corner frequency of 
49.9 kHz and a Q of 0.72 [19], giving a Butterworth (maximally flat) response rolling-off at 
12 dB/octave. Combined with the RIAA equalisation this gives a 6 dB/octave roll-off above 
50 kHz. The loss from this filter at 20 kHz is less than 0.1 dB, so there is little point in 
trying to compensate for it, particularly because other cutting amplifiers are unlikely to have 
identical filters. 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 219
 Opamp MM disc input stages 
 Satisfactory discrete MM preamplifier circuitry is not that straightforward to design, and 
there is a lot to be said for using a good opamp, which, if well-chosen, will have more than 
enough open-loop gain to implement the RIAA bass boost without introducing detectable 
distortion at normal operating levels. The 5534/5532 opamps have input noise parameters that 
are well suited to moving-magnet (MM) cartridges. Having digested this chapter so far, we 
are in a position to summarise the requirements for a good RIAA preamplifier. These are: 
1.  Use a series feedback RIAA network, as shunt feedback is approximately 14 dB noisier. 
2.  Correct gain at 1 kHz. This sounds elementary, but getting the RIAA network right is not 
a negligible task. 
3.  Accuracy. My 1983 preamplifier was designed for ±0.2 dB accuracy from 20 Hz–20 kHz, 
the limit of the testgear I had at the time. This was tightened to ±0.05 dB without using 
rare parts in my 1996 preamplifier. 
4.  Use obtainable components. Resistors will often be from the E24 series, though E96 is 
much more available than it used to be. Capacitors will probably be from the E6 series, 
so intermediate values must be made by series or parallel combinations. 
5.  R0 must be as low as possible as its Johnson noise is effectively in series with the input signal. 
This is particularly important when the MM preamplifier is fed from a low impedance, which 
typically occurs when it is providing RIAA equalisation for the output of an MC preamplifier, 
rather accepting input direct from an MM cartridge with its high inductance. 
6.  The feedback RIAA network impedance to be driven must not be so low as to increase 
distortion or limit output swing, especially at HF. 
7.  The resistive path through the feedback arm should ideally have the same DC resistance as 
input bias resistor R18, to minimise offsets at A1 output. This is a bit of a minor point as 
the offset would have to be quite large to significantly affect the output voltage swing. Very 
often it is not possible to meet this constraint as well as other more important requirements. 
 Calculating the RIAA equalisation components 
 Calculating the values required for series feedback configuration is not straightforward. You 
absolutely cannot take  Figure 8.3 and calculate the time-constants of R2, C2 and R3, C3 as if 
they were independent of each other; the answers will be wrong. Empirical approaches (cut-
and-try) are possible if no great accuracy is required, but attempting to reach even ±0.2 dB by 
this route is tedious, frustrating, and generally bad for your mental health. 
 The definitive paper on this subject is by Stanley Lipshitz [20]. This heroic work covers 
both series and shunt configurations and much more besides, including the effects of low 

220 Chapter 8
open-loop gain. It is relatively straightforward to build a spreadsheet using the Lipshitz 
equations that allows extremely accurate RIAA networks to be designed in a second or two; 
the greatest difficulty is that some of the equations are long and complicated – we’re talking 
real turn-the-paper-sideways algebra here – and some very careful typing is required. 
 Exact RIAA equalisation cannot be achieved with preferred component values, and that extends to 
E24 resistors. If you see any single-stage RIAA preamp where the equalisation is achieved by two 
resistors and two capacitors in the same feedback loop, you can be sure it is not very accurate. 
 My spreadsheet model takes the desired gain at 1 kHz and the value of R0, which sets 
the overall impedance level of the RIAA network. In my preamplifier designs the IEC 
Amendment is definitely  not implemented by restricting the value of C0; this component is 
made large enough to have no significant effect in the audio band, and the Amendment roll-
off is realised in the next stage. 
 Implementing RIAA equalisation 
 It can be firmly stated from the start the best way to implement RIAA equalisation is the 
traditional series-feedback method. So-called passive (usually only semi-passive) RIAA 
configurations suffer from serious compromises on noise and headroom. For completeness 
they are dealt with towards the end of this chapter. 
 There are several different ways to arrange the resistors and capacitors in an RIAA 
network, all of which give identically exact equalisation when the correct component values

are used.  Figure 8.3 shows a series-feedback MM preamp built with what I call RIAA 
Configuration-A, which has the advantage that it makes the RIAA calculations somewhat 
easier, but otherwise is not the best; there will be much more on this topic later. Don’t start 
building it until you’ve read the rest of this chapter; it gives an accurate RIAA response but 
is not otherwise optimised, as it attempts to represent a ‘typical’ design. We will optimise 
it later; we will lower the gain, and reduce the value of R0 to reduce its Johnson noise 
contribution, and the effect of opamp current noise flowing in it. Also note that details that 
are essential for practical use, like input DC-blocking capacitors, DC drain resistors, and 
EMC/cartridge-loading capacitors have been omitted to keep things simple; often the 47 kΩ 
input loading resistor is omitted as well. The addition of these components is fully described 
in the section on practical designs at the end of this chapter. 
 This stage is designed for a gain of 35.0 dB at 1 kHz, which means a maximum input of 
178 mV at the same frequency. With a nominal 5 mVrms input at 1 kHz the output is 280 mV. 
The RIAA accuracy is within ± 0.1 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and the IEC Amendment is 
implemented by making C0 a mere 7.96 μF. You will note with apprehension that only one 
of the components, R0, is a standard value, and that is because it was used as the input to the 
RIAA design calculations that defined the overall RIAA network impedance. This is always 
the case for accurate RIAA networks. Here, even if we assume that capacitors of the exact 
value could be obtained, and we use the nearest E96 resistor values, systematic errors of up 
to 0.06 dB will be introduced. Not a long way adrift, it’s true, but if we are aiming for an 
accuracy of ± 0.1 dB it’s not a good start. If E24 resistors are the best available the errors 
grow to a maximum of 0.12 dB, and don’t forget that we have not considered tolerances – 
we are assuming the values are exact. If we resort to the nearest E12 value, (which really 
shouldn’t be necessary these days) then the errors exceed 0.7 dB at the HF end. And what 
about those capacitors? 
 The answer is of course that by using multiple components in parallel or series we can get 
pretty much what value we like, and it is perhaps surprising that this approach is not adopted 
more often. The reason is probably cost – a couple of extra resistors are no big deal but extra 
capacitors make more of an impact on the costing sheet. The use of multiple components 
also improves the accuracy of the total value, as described in  Chapter 2 (there is more on this 
important topic later in this chapter). 
 The only drawback to the series-feedback RIAA configuration is what might be called the 
unity-gain problem. While the RIAA equalisation curve is not specified above 20 kHz, 
the implication is clear that it will go on falling indefinitely at 6 dB/octave. A series feedback 
stage cannot have a gain of less than unity, so at some point the curve will begin to level 
out and eventually become flat at unity gain; in other words there is a zero in the response. 
 Figure 8.4 shows the various poles and zero frequencies of the circuit in  Figure 8.3 , with their 
associated time-constants. T3, T4 and T5 are the time-constants that define the basic RIAA 

222 Chapter 8
curve, while f3, f4 and f5 are the equivalent frequencies. This is the naming convention used 
by Stanley Lipshitz in his landmark paper, [20] and is used throughout this book. Likewise, 
T2 is the extra time-constant for the IEC Amendment, and T1 shows where its effect ceases 
at very low frequencies when the gain is approaching unity at the low frequency end due 
to C0. At the high end, the final zero is at frequency f6, with associated time-constant T6, 
and because the gain was chosen to be 35 dB at 1 kHz it is quite a long way from 20 kHz 
and has very little effect at this frequency, giving an excess gain of only 0.10 dB. This error 
quickly dies away to nothing as frequency falls below 20 kHz. 
 However, if the gain of the stage is set lower than 35 dB to maximise the input overload 
margin, the 6dB/octave fall tends to level out at unity early enough to cause significant errors 
in the audio band. Adding a HF correction pole (i.e. low-pass time constant) just after the 
input stage makes the simulated and measured frequency response exactly correct. It is not a 
question of bodging the response to make it roughly right. If the correction pole frequency is 
correctly chosen then its roll-off cancels  exactly with the ‘roll-up’ of the final zero at f6. 
 An HF correction pole is demonstrated in  Figure 8.5 , where several important changes have 
been made compared with  Figure 8.3 . The overall impedance of the RIAA network has 
been reduced by making R0 220 Ω, to reduce Johnson noise from the resistors; we still end 
up with some very awkward values. The IEC Amendment is no longer implemented in this 
stage; if it was then the correct value of C0 would be 36.18 μF, and instead it has been made 
220 μF so that its associated 3 dB roll-off does not occur until 3.29 Hz. Even this wide 
spacing introduces an unwanted 0.1 dB loss at 20 Hz, and perfectionists will want to use 
470 μF here, which reduces the error to 0.06 dB. Most importantly, the gain has been reduced 
to 30 dB at 1 kHz to get more overload margin. With a nominal 5 mVrms input at 1 kHz

Amendment which gives an extra roll-off at 20.02 Hz

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 223
the output will be 158 mV. The result is that the final zero f6 in   Figure 8.3   is now at 66.4 kHz, 
much closer in, and it introduces an excess gain at 20 kHz of 0.38 dB, which is too much to 
ignore if you are aiming to make high-class gear. The HF correction pole R4, C4 is therefore 
added, which solves the problem completely. Since there are only two components, and no 
interaction with other parts of the circuit, we have complete freedom in choosing C4 so we 
use a standard E3 value and then get the pole frequency exactly right by using two resistors 
in series for R4–470 Ω and 68 Ω. Since these components are only doing a little fine tuning 
at the top of the frequency range, the tolerance requirements are somewhat relaxed compared 
with the main RIAA network. The design considerations are a) that the resistive section R4 
should be as low as possible in value to minimise Johnson noise, and, on the other hand b) 
that the shunt capacitor C4 should not be large enough to load the opamp output excessively 
at 20 kHz. At this level of accuracy, even the finite gain open-loop gain of even a 5534 at HF 
has a slight effect, and the frequency of the HF pole has been trimmed to compensate for this. 
 Implementing the IEC Amendment 
 The unloved IEC Amendment was almost certainly intended to be implemented by restricting 
the value of the capacitor at the bottom of a series feedback arm, i.e. C0 in   Figures 8.3 
and   8.5  . While electrolytic capacitors nowadays (2013) have relatively tight tolerances of 
±20%, in the 1970’s you would be more likely to encounter 20% 50%, the asymmetry 
reflecting the assumption that electrolytics would be used for non-critical coupling or 
Figure 8.5: Series-feedback RIAA equalisation Conﬁ guration-A, redesigned for 30.0 dB gain 
(1 kHz) which allows a maximum input of 316 mVrms (1 kHz). R0 has been set to 220 Ω to 
reduce RIAA network impedance. The switchable IEC Amendment is implemented by C3, R3. HF 
correction pole R4,C4 is added to keep RIAA accuracy within ±0.1 dB, 20 Hz to 20 kHz.

224 Chapter 8
decoupling purposes where too little capacitance might cause a problem, but more than 
expected would be fine. This wide tolerance meant that there could be significant errors in 
the LF response due to C0.   Figure 8.6   shows the effect of a ±20% C0 tolerance on the RIAA 
response of a preamplifier similar to   Figure 8.5  , with a gain of 30 dB (1 kHz) and C0  
36.13 μF. The gain will be 0.7 dB up at 20 Hz for a 20% C0, and 1.1 dB down at 
20 Hz for a 20% C0. The effect of C0 is negligible above 100 Hz, but this is clearly not a 
good way to make accurate RIAA networks. 
 To get RIAA precision it is necessary to implement the IEC Amendment separately with 
a non-electrolytic capacitor, which can have a tolerance of ±1% if necessary. In several 
of my designs the IEC Amendment has been integrated into the response of the subsonic 
filter that immediately follows the RIAA preamplifier; this gives economy of components 
but means that it is not practicable to make it switchable in and out. Unless buffering is 
provided the series resistance in the HF correction network can interfere with the subsonic 
filter action, causing an early roll-off that degrades RIAA accuracy in the 20–100 Hz 
region. 
 The best solution is a passive CR high-pass network after the preamplifier stage. We 
make C0 large to minimise its effect, and add a separate 7950 μs time-constant after the 
preamplifier, as shown in  Figure 8.5 , where R3 and C3 give the required 3 dB roll-off at 
20.02 Hz. Once again we can use a standard E3 capacitor value and 470 nF has been chosen 
here, and once again an unhelpful resistor value results; in this case 16.91 kΩ. However, 
with E24 values, this can be implemented exactly as 16 kΩ  910 Ω (near-equal series or 
parallel resistor pairs would give more accuracy for a given tolerance). The switch as shown 
will not be entirely click-free because of the offset voltage at A1 output, but that is relatively 
unimportant as it will probably only be operated a few times in the life of the equipment .
 When C0 is made large and the IEC Amendment is done later, we find C0 still has some 
effect. Since it is not infinite in value it will cause a roll-off of gain at some frequency. 
If we make C0 220 μF, which will be a handily compact component, there is an error 
of 0.128 dB at 20 Hz (assuming no IEC Amendment is used). If C0 is 20% high in 
value the error is reduced to 0.094 dB, and if it is 20% low the error is increased 
to 0.192 dB. Making C0 larger, such as 470 μF, reduces the basic error to a rather 
small 0.040 dB, and the variability due to its tolerance becomes negligible. 470 μF 
is a reasonable size at 6V3 rating, which is quite adequate for a component that is only 
exposed to opamp offset voltages. Going to 1000 μF or even 2200 μF starts to make 
significant demands on PCB area, and gains very little extra precision. This is summarised 
in  Table 8.3 . Most of the design examples in this chapter use C0  220 μF, but feel free to 
use 470 μF if you prefer; no other changes are required. 
 It is possible to compensate for the effect of C0 by tweaking the IEC Amendment. In 
 Figure 8.5 the 220 μF value for C0 gives an error of 0.128 dB at 20 Hz. If R3 is changed 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 225
from 16.91 kΩ to 17.4 kΩ the overall response is made accurate to ±0.005 dB. The 
compensation is not mathematically exact – there is a  0.005 dB hump around 20 Hz – but I 
suggest it is good enough for most of us. This process does not of course do anything to reduce 
the effects of the tolerance of C0, and is not usable if it is desired to make the IEC Amendment 
switchable in/out. If a subsonic filter is used, it is probably starting to take action at 20 Hz, and 
so small RIAA errors at this frequency are likely to be irrelevant. 
 The IEC network should come before the HF correction pole, as in  Figure 8.5 , so that R4 
is not loaded by R3, which would cause a 0.3 dB loss; a small amount, perhaps, but you 
would have to recover it somewhere. Instead C3 is loaded by C4, but this has much less

effect. The 0.3 dB figure assumes there is no significant external loading on the output at C4. 
Often the stage will be feeding the high-impedance input of a non-inverting gain stage, but if 
not some sort of buffering may be required so the two output networks behave as designed. 
 Another problem with the ‘small C0’ method of IEC Amendment is the non-linearity 
of electrolytic capacitors when they are asked to form part of a time-constant. This is 
described in detail in  Chapter 2 . Since the MM preamps of the Seventies tended to have 
poor linearity at LF anyway, because the need for bass boost meant a reduction in the LF 
negative feedback factor, introducing another potential source of distortion was not exactly 
an inspired move; on the other hand the signal levels are low. There is no doubt that even 
a simple second-order subsonic filter, switchable in and out, would be a better approach to 
controlling subsonic disturbances. If a Butterworth (maximally flat) alignment was used, 
with a 3 dB point at 20 Hz, this would only attenuate by 0.3 dB at 40 Hz, but would 
give a more useful 8.2 dB at 13 Hz and a thoroughly effective 28 dB at 4 Hz. Not all 
commentators are convinced that the more rapid LF phase changes that result are wholly 
inaudible, but they are; you cannot hear phase [21]. Subsonic filters are examined more 
closely at the end of this chapter. 
 RIAA equalisation by cartridge loading 
 It is possible to implement the LF-boost part of the RIAA characteristic by loading the 
cartridge inductance with a relatively low amplifier input resistance, giving a 6 dB/octave 
slope. As frequency increases the impedance of the inductance increases and the current into 
the input decreases. 
 This idea goes back a long way. The first use of it with a transistor amplifier I am aware of is 
in a 1961 preamplifier design by Tobey and Dinsdale [22], where the input stage was a single 
transistor with shunt feedback around it to implement the HF part of the RIAA curve; the 
cartridge was loaded with a 3.9 kΩ series input resistor rather than the standard 47 kΩ. There 
was another example in 1963 where a 6.8 kΩ input resistor was used with a two transistor 
shunt feedback amplifier. [23] The idea may well have been used in valve circuitry long 
before that. The notion has resurfaced many times since, most recently due to Bob Cordell in 
Jan Didden’s  Linear Audio [24]. 
 Unfortunately there is a crippling snag: the LF equalisation now depends crucially on 
the cartridge inductance, so if you change your cartridge you have to redesign your 
preamplifier. You can, of course, make the loading variable, with a knob labelled 
‘cartridge inductance’, but this assumes you actually know the cartridge inductance, 
and know it accurately. Any inaccuracy in dialling in the inductance is directly reflected 
in errors in the RIAA response. Most people would have to rely on the manufacturer’s 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 227
specification for inductance (a few do not specify it at all) and this is often quoted in 
suspiciously round figures. I also wonder how much the inductance varies between the 
two stereo channels. The normal range of MM cartridge inductance is from 400 mH to 
800 mH, but you might come completely unstuck with unconventional cartridges like 
the moving-iron Grado Prestige series, which quotes an inductance of only 45 mH. The 
technique was criticised by Dinsdale in 1965, who acknowledged the problem of varying 
inductance, and also claimed that causing larger currents to flow through the cartridge 
degraded inter-channel crosstalk because of transformer action between the left and right 
coils [25]. 
 The idea of loading the inductance by a resistance is not wholly worthless. It is used in 
conventional MM inputs, but in a less heavy-handed way. If the MM inductance is, say, 
500 mH, in conjunction with the standard 47 kΩ loading resistor this gives a 6 dB/octave roll-
off starting at 14.96 kHz. This is used by cartridge manufacturers to control HF resonances 
and flatten the top octaves of the frequency response. There is much more on MM cartridge 
inductance and its range of variation in  Chapter 11 on MM-input noise, because it has a 
major effect on this area of performance. 
 It is worth noting that guitar pickups, which have substantial series inductance, are always 
operated into a high impedance of the order of 500 kΩ to 1 MΩ to avoid the loss of high 
frequencies. The capacitance of those long curly leads was often a problem, but now many 
guitarists use radio links. 
 RIAA series-feedback network conﬁ gurations 
 There are four possible configurations described by Lipshitz in his classic paper [20]. These, 
with his component values, are shown in  Figure 8.7 ; the same identifying letters have been 
used. They are all accurate to within ±0.1 dB when implemented with a 5534 opamp, but in 
the case of  Figure 8.7A the error is getting close to 0.1 dB at 20 Hz due to the relatively 
high closed-loop gain (46.4 dB at 1 kHz) and the finite open-loop gain of the 5534. All 
have RIAA networks at a relatively high impedance. They all have relatively high gain and 
therefore a low maximum input. The notation R0, C0, R1, C1, R2, C2 is as used by Lipshitz; 
C1 is always the larger of the two. In each case the IEC Amendment is implemented by the 
value of C0.  
 In recent years I have always used Configuration-A, mainly because long ago I wrote a 
design tool to implement the Lipshitz equations for it. I choose A simply because it was 
the easiest mathematical case. To repeat that for the other three configurations would be a 
significant amount of work, so the question arises, do any of the other three configurations 
have advantages that might make that work worthwhile? 

228 Chapter 8
 Two things to examine come to mind: 
 Firstly, each configuration in  Figure 8.7 contains two capacitors, a large C1 and a small 
C2, that set the RIAA response. If they are close-tolerance (to get accurate RIAA) and 
non-polyester (to prevent capacitor distortion) then they will be expensive, so if there is a 
configuration that makes the large capacitor smaller, even if it is at the expense of making the 
small capacitor bigger, it is well worth pursuing. The large capacitor C1 is probably the most 
expensive component in the RIAA MM amplifier by a large margin. 
 Secondly, the signal voltages across each capacitor are going to be different. If polyester 
capacitors must be used for cost reasons, then if there is a configuration that puts less voltage 
across a capacitor then that capacitor will generate less distortion. Capacitor distortion at least 
triples, and may quadruple, as the voltage across it doubles, so choosing the configuration 
that minimises the voltage is worthwhile. 
 RIAA conﬁ gurations compared for capacitor cost 
 Looking at the capacitor sizing first, we need to put the four configurations A, B, C, and D 
into a form where they can be directly compared. Since in  Figure 8.7 they are all working at 
different impedance levels, as shown by the differing values of R0, the first step is to scale all 
Figure 8.7: The four RIAA feedback conﬁ gurations in the Lipshitz paper, identiﬁ ed by letter

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 229
the RIAA component values to make R0 exactly 200 Ω, as in  Figure 8.8 . C0 then comes out 
as 39.75 μF in each case, and implements the IEC Amendment. The scaling does not affect 
the gain or the RIAA accuracy; this was checked by simulation for each configuration. The 
new capacitor values are summarised in  Table 8.4  
   Fortunately the gains of A, B, and C are nearly the same, so we can compare the values for 
C1, and it looks as if A might actually be the worst case for capacitor size. To be certain 
about this we have to alter the gain of A to be exactly the same as B and C at 45.5 dB. 
Configuration-D has significantly bigger capacitors than A, B, and C because it has about 
half the gain but the same value of R0, so that gain also has to be altered. Changing the gain

of an RIAA network is of course a non-trivial task, and we don’t have the software tools for 
B, C, or D to do it quickly and with precision. We have to work out if it is worth writing one 
or more of those three tools. 
 Not having the tools, we can change the gain by simply scaling the RIAA network values of 
A and D, with R0 kept constant. We must accept that the results may not be very accurate but 
should be good enough for us to judge which configuration is superior. We need to reduce the 
gain of A by 0.899 dB, or a factor of 1.109 times; we therefore multiply the capacitors C1 and 
C2 by this factor, and divide the resistors R1 and R2 by it. For D, we want to increase the 
gain by 4.948 dB, or 1.767 times, so now we divide the capacitors C1 and C2 by this factor, 
and multiply the resistors R1 and R2 by it. This gives the values shown in  Figure 8.9 and 
 Table 8.5 . The C1/C2 ratios are unchanged. 
 After this process, the Configuration-A, though less accurate than before, is still within 
a ±0.1 dB error band; a completely accurate version with the same gain was calculated 
directly from the Lipshitz equations and is shown in  Figure 8.10A ; note that the values 
of C1, C2 and R1, R2 are all slightly different, as you cannot change RIAA gain simply 
by scaling against R0 and get the exactly correct result. For Configuration-D, which

wholly accurate. Maximum input in each case is only 53 mVrms (1 kHz) which is not generally adequate

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 231
has undergone a greater gain change, the RIAA errors now exceed 0.1 dB (though not 
by much) at several frequencies. This is accurate enough to allow assessment of the 
configurations. 
   It is immediately obvious from  Figures 8.9 and  8.10 , and  Table 8.5 , that C1 in 
Configuration-C is only 64% the size of C1 in Configuration-A. I was afraid that this might 
be accompanied by an increase in C2 in Configuration-C, but this is also smaller at 81%. 
Unhappily it looks as if Configuration-A (which I have been using for years) makes the least 
efficient use of its capacitors, since they are effectively in series, reducing the effective value 
of both of them. Configurations B and D have intermediate values for C1, but of the two D 
has a significantly smaller C2. Configuration-C would appear to be the optimal solution in 
terms of capacitor size and hence cost. To design it accurately for gains other than 45.5 dB 
(1 kHz) meant building a software tool for it from the Lipshitz equations for Configuration-C. 
This I duly did, though, just as anticipated, it was somewhat more difficult than it had been 
for Configuration-A. 
 While Configuration-C in  Figures 8.9 and  8.10 has come out as the most economical, our 
work here is not done. It will not have escaped you that a gain as high as 45.5 dB at 1 kHz

is not going to give a great overload margin; it has only been used so far because it was the 
gain adopted in the Lipshitz paper. If we assume our opamp can provide 10 Vrms out, then 
the maximum input at 1 kHz is only 53 mVrms, which is mediocre at best. The gain of an 
MM input stage should not, in my opinion, much exceed 30 dB at 1 kHz (see the earlier 
example in   Figure 8.5  ). 
 My Precision Preamplifier design [18] has an MM stage gain of 29 dB at 1 kHz, 
allowing a maximum input of 354 mVrms (1 kHz). The more recent Elektor Preamplifier 
2012 [26] has an MM stage gain of 30 dB (1 kHz), allowing a maximum input of 
316 mVrms; it is followed by a flat switched-gain stage which allows for the large range 
in MC cartridge sensitivity. 
 I used the new software tool for Configuration-C to design the MM input stage in 
  Figure 8.11  , which has a gain of 30 dB (1 kHz). This design has an RIAA response, 
including the IEC Amendment, that is accurate to within ±0.01 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz 
(it is assumed C0 is accurate). The relatively low gain means that an HF correction pole 
is required to maintain accuracy at the top of the audio band, and this is implemented by 
R3 and C3. Without this pole the response is 0.1dB high at 10 kHz, and 0.37 dB high at 
20 kHz. R3 is a non-preferred value as we have used the E6 value of 2n2 for capacitor C3. 
 In  Figure 8.11 , and in the examples that follow, I have implemented the IEC Amendment 
by using the appropriate value for C0, rather than by adding an extra time-constant after 
the amplifier as in Figure 8.5. We noted above that using C0 is not the best method, but 
I have stuck with it here as it is instructive how the correct value of C0 changes as other 
alterations are made to the RIAA network. 
Figure 8.11: Conﬁ guration-C with values calculated from the Lipshitz equations to give 30.0 
dB gain at 1 kHz, and an accurate RIAA response within ±0.01 dB; the lower gain now requires HF 
correction pole R3, C3 to maintain accuracy at the top of the audio band

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 233
 RIAA network optimisation: C1 as a single E6 capacitor 
 Looking at  Figure 8.11 , a further stage of optimisation is possible after choosing the best 
RIAA configuration. There is nothing magical about the value of R0 at 200 Ω, (apart from the 
bare fact that it’s an E24 value) it just needs to be suitably low for a good noise performance, 
so it can be manipulated to make at least one of the capacitor values more convenient, the 
larger one being the obvious candidate. Compared with the potential savings on expensive 
capacitors here, the cost of a non-preferred value for R0 is negligible. It is immediately clear 
that C1, at 34.9 nF, is close to 33 nF. If we twiddle the new software tool for Configuration-C 
so that C1 is exactly 33 nF, we get the arrangement in  Figure 8.12 . R0 has only increased 
by 6%, and so the effect on the noise performance will be quite negligible. All the values in 
the RIAA feedback network have likewise altered by about 6%, including C0, but the HF 
correction pole is unchanged; we would only need to alter it if we altered the gain. As for 
 Figure 8.11 , the RIAA accuracy of this version is well within ±0.01 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz 
when implemented with a 5534. 
 The circuit of  Figure 8.12 has two preferred-value capacitors, but that is the most we can 
manage. All the other values are, as expected, thoroughly awkward. In  Chapter 2 I described 
how to make up arbitrary resistor values by paralleling two or more resistors, and how the 
optimal way to do this is with resistors of as nearly equal values as you can manage. If the 
values are equal, then the tolerance errors partly cancel, and the accuracy of the combination 
is √2 times better than the individual resistors. The resistors are assumed to be E24, and 
the parallel pairs were selected using a specially written software tool. The three-part 
combination for C2, which I have assumed restricted to E6 values, was done by manual 
Figure 8.12: Conﬁ guration-C from Figure 8.10 with RO tweaked to make C1 exactly the E6 
preferred value of 33.000 nF. Gain is still 30.0 dB at 1 kHz, and RIAA accuracy within ±0.01 dB. 
The HF correction pole R3, C3 is unchanged

bodging, though as you can see from  Table 8.6 , we have been rather lucky with how the 
values work out, with only three components getting us very close to the exact value we want. 
 Figure 8.13 shows the resulting circuit. 
 The criterion used when selecting the parallel resistor pairs was that the error in the nominal 
value should be less than half of the component tolerance, assumed to be ±1%. R2 only just 
squeaks in, but its near-equal values will give almost all of the √2 improvement. Remember 
that in  Table 8.6 we are dealing here with nominal values, and the % error in the nominal 
value shown in the rightmost column has nothing to do with the resistor tolerances.

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 235
 No attempt has been made here to deal with the non-standard value for C0. In practice C0 
will be a large value such as 220 μF so its wide tolerance will have no significant effect on 
RIAA accuracy. The IEC Amendment will be implemented (if at all) by a later time-constant 
using a non-electrolytic, as shown earlier in   Figure 8.5 . 
 Obviously the slight errors in nominal value seen in the rightmost column of  Table 8.6 have 
some effect.  Figure 8.14 shows that the gain at 1 kHz now peaks by 0.048 dB at 1 kHz, 
which is not the end of the world. By pure coincidence 1 kHz is actually where the RIAA 
accuracy is worst. At higher frequencies the error slowly declines to 0.031 dB at 20 kHz. 
Most of this deviation is caused by the 0.44% error in the nominal value of R2; greater 
accuracy could be got by using a three-resistor combination. 
 RIAA network optimisation: C1 as multiple 10 nF capacitors 
 We have just modified the RIAA network so that the major capacitor C1 is a single 
preferred value. The optimisation of the RIAA component values can be tackled in another 
way however; much depends on the initial assumptions about component availability. In 
many polystyrene capacitor ranges 10 nF is the highest value that can be obtained with a 
tolerance of 1%; in other cases the price goes up rather faster than proportionally above 
10 nF. Paralleling several 10 nF polystyrene capacitors is  much more cost-effective than 
using a single precision polypropylene part. 
 To use this method we need to redesign the circuit of  Figure 8.12 so that C1 is either 
exactly 30 nF or exactly 40 nF (there is a practical design using Configuration-A with 
Figure 8.14: The RIAA accuracy of Figure 8.13. Gain is 30.05 dB at 1 kHz, and RIAA error 
reaches a maximum of 0.048 dB midband

236 Chapter 8
5  10 nF  50 nF at the end of this chapter, underlining the fact that Configuration-A 
makes less efficient use of its capacitance). The 40 nF version costs more than the 30 nF 
version but gives a total capacitance that is twice as accurate as one capacitor (because 
√4  2), while the 30 nF version only improves accuracy by √3 ( 1.73) times. Using 
40 nF gives somewhat lower general impedance for the RIAA network that may reduce 
noise very slightly.  Figure 8.15 shows the result for C1  30 nF, and  Figure 8.16 shows the 
result for C1  40 nF. Since the gain is unchanged the values for the HF correction pole 
R3, C3 are also unchanged in each case. 
 To turn  Figure 8.15 into a practical circuit, the awkward component values are made up with 
optimally-selected parallel pairs. The results of this process for C1  30 nF are in  Table 8.7 
and  Figure 8.16 . In this case we have been unlucky with the value of C2, which needs to 
be trimmed with a 120 pF capacitor to meet the criterion that the error in the nominal value 
will not exceed half the component tolerance. This configuration has been built with 1% 
capacitors and measured, and it works exactly as it should. It gave a cost saving of about £2 
on the product concerned. 
 The same process can be applied to the 4  10 nF version in  Figure 8.17 , giving the results in 
 Table 8.8 and  Figure 8.18. 
 This time we are much luckier with the value of C2; three 4n7 capacitors in parallel give 
almost exactly the required value. On the other hand we are very unlucky with R0, where 
180 Ω in parallel with 6.2 kΩ is the most ‘equal-value’ solution that falls within our error 
criterion.

 Both my Precision Preamplifier [18] and the more recent Elektor Preamplifier 2012 [26] 
have MM stage gains close to 30 dB (1 kHz), like the examples above, but both use 
Configuration-A, and five paralleled 10 nF capacitors are required. 
 Our investigations have shown that there are very real differences in how efficiently the 
various RIAA networks use their capacitors, and it looks clear that using Configuration-C 
rather than Configuration-A will cut the cost of the expensive capacitors C1 and C2 in an 
MM stage by 36% and 19% respectively, which I suggest is both a new result and well worth 
having. From there we went on to find that different constraints on capacitor availability lead 
to different optimal solutions for Configuration-C.

 It seems likely that further optimisation of the RIAA networks shown here is possible. 
For example, we noticed that changing R0 from 200 Ω to 211.74 Ω had a negligible 
effect on the noise performance; worse by only 0.02 dB. That is well below the limits of 
measurement, and we could ask what happens if we grit our teeth and accept a 0.1 dB 
noise deterioration? That is still at or below most measurement limits. It implies that R0 
is 270 Ω, and the RIAA network impedance is therefore increased by 35%, so we could 
for example omit one of the 10 nF capacitors in  Figure 6.18 , with of course suitable 
adjustments to all the other circuit values, and save some more of our hard-earned 
money.

 RIAA conﬁ gurations compared for capacitor voltages 
 Turning to our second issue – the signal voltages across the capacitors in each configuration – 
a good deal of simulation tells us that there is very little to choose between the four 
configurations as regards the signal voltage across the capacitors. Not a helpful result or an 
interesting result, but sometimes things just are that way. 
 A related but different question is: if we assume a certain amount of non-linearity in one or 
both of the RIAA capacitors, are the configurations different in their sensitivity to that non-
linearity? In other words, how much distortion will appear at the output? This question could 
be resolved in simulation, by using non-linear capacitor models constructed with Analog 
Behavioural Modelling, but it would be a lot of work, and since the emphasis of this book is 
on high quality, where we can presumably afford a polypropylene capacitor or two, I have put 
that one on the back-burner. Indeed, it may fall completely off the back of the cooker. 

240 Chapter 8
 Equivalent RIAA conﬁ gurations 
 You may be wondering if the four configurations in  Figure 8.9 actually cover all possible 
single-stage series-feedback RIAA arrangements. The configurations can be differently 
arranged as if two components are in series, with nothing connected to their junction point, 
it does not matter in which order they occur. In  Figure 8.19 the configurations A and A’ are 
electrically identical. This looks pretty obvious, but it is perhaps a bit less so for B B’, C C’, 
and D D’, in which the identical topology can be drawn in several different ways. Burkhard 
Vogel, in his monumental book on noise  The Sound of Silence, describes Configuration-A as 
a Type-Eub network, Configuration-B’ as a Fub-B network, and Configuration-C as a Fub-A 
network [27]. Configuration-D is not examined.  
 RIAA components 
 Many of the factors affecting the choice of components for the RIAA network, such as accuracy, 
linearity, and cost have already been dwelt on at length. Here are a few more points to ponder: 
 • Resistors should be metal film for good linearity, with two or more near-equal E24 
values paralleled to obtain the non-preferred resistance values. See  Chapter 2 . 
 • For close-tolerance capacitors the best solution seems to be axial polystyrene types 
which are freely available at 1% tolerance up to 10 nF. Some paralleling is required, 
and in fact is highly desirable. This is because the sum of multiple capacitors is more 
accurate than a single component of the same tolerance, so long as the mean is well 
controlled, because the capacitances sum arithmetically but the random errors partially 
cancel. This is described in detail in  Chapter 2 . Both the preamp examples at the end 
of this chapter use multiple capacitors in this way. 
 • Polystyrene capacitors have two foils, and one of them will be on the outside of the 
component, and so vulnerable to capacitive crosstalk and hum pickup. It is desirable 
that the capacitor is orientated so that the outer foil is connected to the circuit node 
with the lowest impedance; very often this can be arranged to be the stage output, 
which is at a very low impedance and immune to capacitive pickup. Some capacitor 
manufacturers mark the outer foil; for example, the outer foil of polystyrene capacitors 
manufactured by LCR is indicated by the mitred corner on the packaging. Inexpensive 
polystyrene caps may not have consistent foil placement. Other types of capacitor, 
such as polypropylene, have similar considerations. With axial types the outer foil is 
likely to be marked by a line at one end, if indeed it is marked at all. The outer foil of a 
capacitor can be quickly identified with an oscilloscope. Ground one lead and put the 
probe on the other, and see how much hum the capacitor picks up from your fingers. 
Reverse the connections and repeat. When the outer foil is grounded, much less hum is 
picked up.

 RIAA component sensitivity: Conﬁ guration-A 
 The ‘component sensitivity’ of a circuit defines how much its response varies as a result 
of component value tolerances. It has nothing to do with gain or signal levels. It is much 
affected by the way the circuit works – the higher the Q of an active filter, the greater its 
component sensitivity. 
 Components have tolerances on their value, and we need to assess what RIAA accuracy 
is possible without spending a fortune on precision parts; ±1% is the best tolerance 
readily available for metal-film resistors and polystyrene capacitors, so at first it appears 
anything better than ±0.1 dB accuracy is out of the question. This is not so, for the 
simple reason that across the audio band more than one component determines the 
response. Higher precision can be obtained by using multiple components, as we have 
noted before. 
 We saw above that Configuration-C was more economical than Configuration-A. We might 
wonder whether we pay for that in increased component sensitivity for Configuration-C. 
Sensitivity analysis can be done by involved mathematics, or more simply by making ±1% 
changes in the components of a preamp simulation. The results in   Figures 8.20 and  8.21 
include the IEC Amendment, implemented by C0. The effect of C0 tolerances on accuracy 
has already been examined in this chapter.

 Figures 8.22 and  8.23 show the same results but for Configuration-C. The component 
sensitivities for both configurations are summarised in  Table 8.9 , which shows that there is 
not much to choose between them. Configuration-A is better for C2, but Configuration-C is 
better for R2 and C1. There is no reason here to not use Configuration-C. 
 Open-loop gain and RIAA accuracy 
 There is no point in having a super-accurate RIAA network if the active element does not have 
enough open-loop gain to correctly render the response demanded. This was a major problem 
for two- and three-transistor discrete MM input stages, but one might have hoped that it would 
have disappeared with the advent of usable opamps. However, life is flawed, and gain problems

did not wholly vanish. The TL072 was at one time widely used for MM inputs because of its 
affordability, even though its JFET input devices are a poor match to MM cartridge impedances, 
and its distortion performance was not of the best. However, there was another lurking problem. 
 As we have seen earlier in this chapter, the appropriate gain (at 1 kHz) for an MM input 
is between 30 and 40 dB. The TL072 does not have enough open-loop gain to give an 
accurate response with a closed-loop gain of a 35 dB.  Figure 8.24 shows the result of a 
simulation using Configuration-A RIAA with accurate values derived from the Lipshitz 
equations. There is a 0.2 dB dip between 3 and 10 kHz; the vertical scale is ±1 dB. In the 
simulations that follow, the IEC Amendment is not implemented. 
 Replacing the TL072 with a 5534 opamp, which has more open-loop gain, reduced the RIAA 
error to much less than 0.1 dB across the audio band. The TL072 has an LF gain of 200,000 
times and a dominant pole at 20 Hz (all typical specs). The 5534 has a lower LF gain of 
100,000 but its pole (uncompensated) is much higher at 1 kHz, so at any frequency above 
40 Hz the 5534 has more open-loop gain to offer. At all frequencies above 1 kHz the 5534 
has 30 dB more gain than the TL072. These parameters are subject to production variations. 
 Figure 8.25 shows the RIAA accuracy using a 5534A in a 35 dB (1 kHz) gain preamp; 
note that the amplitude scale has changed from ±1 dB down to ±0.2 dB. The RIAA error 
is negligible (less than ±0.01 dB) above 100 Hz, but reaches a maximum of 0.025 dB 
at 30 Hz. The rising response error at the HF end (0.12 dB at 20 kHz) is due to the gain

levelling off at f6, but this is here cancelled by an HF correction pole that reduces the HF 
error to less than ±0.01 dB. 
 Figure 8.26 shows the same results for a 5534 in a 30 dB (1 kHz) preamp. HF accuracy is 
better, but the LF error is not much reduced, being 0.020 dB at 30 Hz, indicating it may 
not be due to a lack of open-loop gain. This error can be reduced to 0.005 dB by adjusting 
the value of R1 upwards by trial and error, no other RIAA components being altered. One 
wonders if there might be a small systematic error buried in the Lipshitz equations, or more 
likely in my application of them. The uncorrected HF response has a greater error of 0.37 dB 
at 20 kHz, as the gain is levelling off towards unity at a lower f6 frequency, but this is once 
more fully sorted out by the HF correction pole. 
 The 5534 has quite a complicated internal structure with nested Miller loops for compensation. 
It is not obvious (to me, anyway) whether this has anything to do with the interaction of open-
loop gain with RIAA accuracy. It seemed worthwhile to do a few more simulations to get a 
better idea of the situation. The SPICE opamp model is replaced with the simplest possible 
conceptual opamp. This has only two parameters – the LF open-loop gain and the dominant-
pole frequency – and is modelled by a voltage-controlled-voltage source (VCVS) with a gain 
of 100,000 times, combined with a first-order RC filter that is 3 dB at 100 Hz. 
 We will start off with a 40 dB (1 kHz) preamp. The simulation results are shown in  Figure 8.27 ; 
the maximum errors are 0.09 dB at 150 Hz and 0.16 dB at 20 kHz.

pole. Scale ±0.2 dB

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 247
 Rinse and repeat with a 35 dB (1 kHz) preamp, and we get the  Figure 8.28 ; the maximum 
errors are 0.03 dB at 40 Hz and 0.095 dB at 20 kHz. This is a useful improvement in 
accuracy at both LF and HF, and gives some idea of what basic opamp performance is 
required for a precise RIAA characteristic.

 Do it again with a 30 dB (1 kHz) preamp, and we get  Figure 8.29 ; the maximum errors are 
now 0.025 dB at 30 Hz and 0.04 dB at 20 kHz. This is another handy improvement in 
accuracy at HF, but, as with the 5534 simulations, we note that there seems to be a small but 
persistent error at the LF end. 
 The error curves shown above have very gentle slopes. This is because the open-loop gain is 
falling at 6 dB/octave, but the demanded closed-loop gain is also falling at roughly this rate 
(not forgetting the plateau between 500 Hz and 2 kHz) so the error would be expected to be 
very roughly constant across the audio band. 
 To summarise, the open-loop gain of a 5534A is not adequate for a closed-loop gain of 
40 dB at 1 kHz if you are aiming for an accurate RIAA response, and the 35 dB (1 kHz) 
situation is marginal. For 30 dB (1 kHz) the errors due to limited open-loop gain are 
negligible compared with the expected tolerances of the passive RIAA components. We have 
already seen that, if a wide range of cartridges and recording levels are to be accommodated, 
the minimum gain should be no more than 30 dB (1 kHz), so this works out quite nicely. 
 Switched-gain RIAA ampliﬁ ers 
 As noted above, it is not necessary to have a wide range of variable or stepped gain if we are 
only dealing with MM inputs, due to the limited spread of MM cartridge sensitivities – only 
about 7 dB. However, the sensitivity range of MC cartridges is very much greater (about 
36 dB), so when the MM stage is being used as an RIAA equaliser, it would be very convenient 
if its gain could be easily changed. This would eliminate the need for a switched gain stage after 
the MM stage; such stages are dealt with later in this chapter. According to Peter Baxandall, at 
least two gain options are desirable [28]. 
 However, as we have seen, the design of one-stage RIAA networks is not easy, and you might 
suspect that altering R0 away from the design point to change the gain is going to lead to 
some response errors. How right you are. Changing R0 introducing an LF RIAA error, plus 
an HF error as the HF correction pole is now wrong. Here are some examples, where the 
RIAA components are calculated for a gain of 30 dB, with R0  200 Ω, and then the gain 
increased by reducing R0: 
 • For 30 dB gain switched to 35 dB gain, (R0  112.47 Ω) the RIAA LF error 
is 0.07 dB 20 Hz–1 kHz, but the HF error is much bigger at 0.26 dB at 20 kHz. 
 • For 30 dB gain switched to 40 dB gain, (R0  63.245 Ω) the RIAA LF error is 
0.10 dB 20 Hz–1 kHz, the HF error is at 0.335 dB at 20 kHz. 
 This includes the effect of finite open-loop gain when using a 5534 as the opamp. 

250 Chapter 8
 Thus for real accuracy we need to switch not only R0 but also R1 in the RIAA feedback path, 
and R3 in the HF correction pole. If the RIAA error tolerance is ±0.1 dB, switching R1 could 
be omitted but two resistors still need to be switched. This assumes that the IEC Amendment 
is performed by a CR network after the MM stage, as described above; this will be unaffected 
by changes in R0. Otherwise, if the IEC Amendment is implemented by a small value of C0, 
you would need to switch that component as well, to avoid gross RIAA errors below 100 Hz. 
All in all, switched-gain RIAA amplifiers are not an attractive proposition. If you are catering 
for the full MC cartridge range then you will need five 5-dB steps, and you are switching 
an absolute minimum of two precision components if you are making any attempt at all at 
accuracy. That means lots of precise components and a 5-way 4-pole switch for stereo, which 
is an expensive and clumsy solution. 
 Shunt-feedback RIAA equalisation 
 The shunt-feedback equivalent of the basic RIAA stage is shown in  Figure 8.30 . It has 
occasionally been advocated because it avoids the unity-gain problem, but it has the 
crippling disadvantage that with a real cartridge load, with its substantial inductance, it 
is about 14 dB noisier than the series RIAA configuration [29]. A great deal of grievous 
twaddle has been talked about RIAA equalisation and transient response, in perverse 
attempts to render the shunt RIAA configuration acceptable despite its serious noise 
disadvantage. Since the input resistor R0 has to be 47 kΩ to load the cartridge correctly, 
the RIAA network has to operate at a correspondingly high impedance and will be noisy. 
 A series-feedback disc stage cannot make its gain fall below one, as described above, 
while the shunt-feedback version can; however an HF correction pole solves that 
problem completely. Shunt feedback eliminates any possibility of common-mode 
distortion, but then at the signal levels we are dealing with that is not a problem, at least 
with bipolar input opamps. A further disadvantage is that a shunt-feedback RIAA stage 
gives a phase inversion that can be highly inconvenient if you are concerned to preserve 
absolute phase. 
Figure 8.30: Shunt-feedback RIAA conﬁ guration. This is 14 dB noisier than the series-feedback 
version

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 251
 Simulating inverse RIAA equalisation 
 SPICE simulation is well suited to the task of checking that the RIAA component values 
chosen are accurate. The best way to do this is to build an inverse-RIAA model to feed 
the RIAA preamplifier being simulated. This is much, much simpler than designing the 
preamplifier RIAA network because the time-constants can be completely decoupled from 
each other by using unity-gain buffers with zero-impedance outputs. The required response 
can be implemented in many ways, but my version is shown in  Figure 8.31 . The component 
values have nothing to do with practical circuitry and are chosen simply for ease of 
calculation. 
 The first network C1, R1 implements the 7960 μs time-constant of the notorious IEC 
Amendment. Since this first network is the inverse of a bass-roll-off, its output must 
continue to rise indefinitely at 6 dB/octave as frequency falls, and it is therefore 
implemented with a current-source, so that as the impedance of C1 rises, the output 
voltage at node 20 rises indefinitely. The apparently odd value of 1.011 A for the 
current source is in fact cunningly chosen to give a final output of 0 dBV at 1 kHz, 
which simplifies SPICE output plotting. The 10 GigaOhm resistor Rdummy is required 
as SPICE otherwise considers node 20 to be at an undefined DC level, and objects 
strongly. The voltage at node 20 controls the output of the VCVS (voltage-controlled 
voltage source) E1 which has its gain set to unity. It has zero output impedance and so 
acts as a mathematically perfect buffer. E is the conventional designator for a VCVS in 
SPICE. 
 E1 then drives the network R2, C3, R3, which implements the 3180 μs and 318 μs time-
constants. E2 acts as another perfect buffer for the voltage at node 23, and drives R4, C3, R5, 
which implement the 75 μs time-constant. The very low value for R5 allows the output to go 
rising at 6 dB/octave to well beyond 20 kHz; the response does not level out until the T6 zero 
at 2.12 MHz is reached. If the IEC Amendment is not required, increase C1 to 10,000 μF so it 
has no effect in the audio band.

 Physical inverse RIAA equalisation 
 Building a sufficiently accurate inverse RIAA network for precision measurements is not to 
be entered upon lightly or unadvisedly. The component values will need to have an accuracy 
a good deal better than 1%, and this makes sourcing components difficult and expensive. A 
much better alternative is to use a test system such as those by Audio Precision that allow an 
equalisation file to modify the generator output level during a frequency sweep. 
 Passive and semi-passive RIAA equalisation 
 For many years, series-feedback RIAA preamplifiers as described above were virtually 
universal, it being accepted by all that they gave the best noise, overload performance, and 
economy, especially of active components. However, human nature being what it is, some 
people will always want to do things the hard way, and this is exemplified by the fashion 
for passive (actually, semi-passive is more accurate) RIAA equalisation. The basic notion is 
to split the RIAA equalisation into separate stages, and I have a dark and abiding suspicion 
that this approach may be popular simply because it makes the design of accurate RIAA 
equalisation much easier, as all you have to do is calculate simple time-constants instead of 
grappling with foot-long equations. There is a price, and a heavy one: the overload and/or 
noise performance is inevitably compromised. 
 Clearly a completely passive RIAA stage is a daft idea because a lot of gain is required 
somewhere to get the 5 mV cartridge signal up to a usable amplitude. The nearest you can 
get to completely passive is the scheme shown in  Figure 8.32a , where the amplification and 
the equalisation are wholly separate, with no frequency-dependent feedback used at all. 
R2, R3 and C1 implement T3 and T4, while C2 implements T5. There is no inconvenient 
T6 because the response carries on falling indefinitely with frequency. This network clearly 
gives its maximum gain at 20 Hz, and at 1 kHz it attenuates by about 20 dB. Therefore, if 
we want the modest 30 dB gain at 1 kHz used in the previous example, the  A1  stage must 
have a gain of no less than 50 dB. A 5 mVrms 1 kHz input would therefore result in 1.58 V 
at the output of A1. This is only 16 dB below clipping, assuming we are using the usual sort 
of opamps, and an overload margin of 16 dB is much too small to be usable. It is obviously 
impossible to drive anything like a volume control or tone control stage from the passive 
network, so the buffer stage A2 is shown to emphasise that extra electronics is required with 
this approach. 
 The only way to improve the overload margin is to split the gain so that the A1 stage has 
perhaps 30 dB, while A2 after the passive RIAA network makes up the loss with 20 dB more 
gain. Sadly, this second stage of amplification must introduce extra noise, and there is always 
the point that you now have to put the signal through two amplifiers instead of one, so there is 
the potential for increased distortion. 

Figure 8.32: Passive and semi-passive RIAA conﬁ gurations

254 Chapter 8
 The most popular architecture that separates the high and low RIAA sections is seen in 
 Figure 8.32b . Here there is an active LF RIAA stage using feedback to implement T3 
and T4 with R1, C1, R2, followed by R3, C2 which give a passive HF cut for T5. This is 
what I call an active-passive configuration. The values shown give an RIAA curve correct 
to within 0.04 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Note that because of the lack of time-constant 
interaction, we can choose standard values for both capacitors, but we are still left with 
awkward resistor values. 
 As before, amplification followed by attenuation means a headroom bottleneck, and this 
passive HF roll-off is no exception. Signals direct from disc have their highest amplitudes at 
high frequencies, so both these configurations give poor HF headroom, overload occurring at 
A1 output before passive HF cut can reduce the level.  Figure 8.33 shows how the level at A1 
output (Trace B) is higher at HF than the output signal (Trace A). The difference is Trace C, 
the headroom loss; from 1 dB at 1 kHz this rises to 14 dB at 10 kHz and continues to increase 
in the ultrasonic region. The passive circuit was driven from an inverse RIAA network, so a 
totally accurate disc stage would give a straight line just below the 30 dB mark. 
 A related problem in this semi-passive configuration is that the opamp A1 must handle a signal 
with much more HF content than the opamp in the single-stage series-feedback configuration, 
worsening any difficulties with slew-limiting and HF distortion. It uses two amplifier stages 
rather than one, and more precision components, because of the extra resistor. Another difficulty 
is that A1 is more likely to run out of open-loop gain or slew rate at HF, as the response 
Figure 8.33: Headroom loss with passive RIAA equalisation. The signal level at A1 (Trace B) 
is greater than at A2 (Trace A) so clipping occurs there ﬁ rst. Trace C shows the headroom loss, 
which reaches 18 dB at 20 kHz

plateaus above 1 kHz rather than being steadily reduced by increasing negative feedback. Once 
again a buffer stage A2 is required to isolate the final time-constant from loading. 
 A third method of equalisation is shown in  Figure 8.32c , where the T5 roll-off is done by 
feedback via R4, C2 rather than by passive attenuation. This is not really passive in any 
way, as the equalisation is done in two active stages, but it does share the feature of splitting 
up the time-constants for easier design. As with the previous circuit, A1 is running under 
unfavourable conditions as it has to handle a larger HF content than in the series-feedback 
version, and there is now an inconvenient phase reversal. The values shown give the same 
gain and RIAA accuracy as the previous circuit, though in this case the value of R3 can be 
scaled to change the gain. 
 There are many other alternative arrangements that can be used for passive or semi-passive 
equalisation. There could be a flat input stage followed by a passive HF cut and then another 
stage to give the LF boost, as in  Figure 8.32d , which has even more headroom problems and 
uses yet more bits. I call this a passive-active configuration. In contrast the ‘all-in-one-go’ 
series feedback configuration avoids unnecessary headroom restrictions and has the minimum 
number of stages. 
 Passive RIAA is not an attractive option for general use, but comes into its own in the 
archival transcription of recordings, where there are dozens of different pre-RIAA 
equalisation schemes, and it must be possible to adjust the turnover frequencies f3, f4 and f5 
independently. This is done most straight-forwardly by a fifth passive-passive equalisation 
configuration which is described in detail in  Chapter 9 . 
 As always, what you think is a recent trend has its roots in the past. An active-passive 
MM input stage was published in  Wireless World in 1961 [30]. This had a two-transistor 
series-feedback amplifier which dealt with the LF equalisation, followed by a passive RC 
HF roll-off. 
 Peter Baxandall published a circuit in 1981 [28] with the configuration of  Figure 8.32b  
that gave easy switched gain control and allowed the use of preferred values, with only 
two of them in the E24 series. Like all Peter’s ideas it is well worth studying and is shown 
in   Figure 8.34  . The gains are 20, 30 and 40 dB, accurate to within ±0.3 dB; the 
switchable gain largely avoids the headroom problems of passive RIAA equalisation. The 
RIAA accuracy is within ±0.03 dB between 1 kHz and 20 kHz in each case, falling off 
to about 0.1 dB at 100 Hz. This is due to the way that R0 and C0 implement the IEC 
Amendment, giving f2  21.22 Hz rather than the correct 20.02 Hz; that is as close as you 
can get with a single 750 Ω E24 resistor for R0. It results in a response 0.34 dB too low 
at 20 Hz. The correct value for R0 is 795 Ω, so f2 could be made much more accurate by 
using the parallel pair 1 kΩ and 3.9 kΩ, which is only 0.1% too high. However, there is the 
tolerance of C0 to be considered, and when Peter was writing (1981) that would have been 
larger than we would expect today, so 750 Ω was close enough. 

256 Chapter 8
 One problem with this circuit suggests itself. When the gain switch is between contacts, A1 
has no feedback and will hit the rails. Very likely Peter was thinking of a make-before break 
switch. Another possible way of solving this is given in  Figure 8.36 below, where feedback 
is maintained when the switch moves. The TDA1034B was an early version of the 5534, and 
capable of driving the relatively low impedance of the R2C2 combination. 
 MM cartridge loading and frequency response 
 The standard loading for a moving-magnet cartridge is 47 kΩ in parallel with a certain amount 
of capacitance, the latter usually being specified by the maker. The resulting resonance 
with the cartridge inductance is deliberately used by manufacturers to extend the frequency 
response, so it is wise to think hard before trying to modify it. Load capacitance is normally in 
the range 50 to 200 pF. The capacitance is often the subject of experimentation by enthusiasts, 
and so switchable capacitors are often provided at the input of high-end preamplifiers which 
allow several values to be set up by combinations of switch positions. The exact effect of 
altering the capacitance depends on the inductance and resistance of the cartridge, but a typical 
result is shown in   Figure 8.35   where increasing the load capacitance lowers the resonance peak 
frequency and makes it more prominent and less damped. It is important to remember that it is 
the total capacitance, including that of the connecting leads, which counts. 
 Because of the high inductance of an MM cartridge, adjusting the load resistance can also 
have significant effects on the frequency response, and some preamplifiers allow this too to 
be altered. The only objective way to assess the effects of these modifications is to measure 
the output when a special (and expensive) test disc is played. 
 When loading capacitance is used it should be as near to the input socket as possible so it can 
contribute to filtering out RF before it radiates inside the enclosure. However, its effectiveness 
for EMC purposes is likely to be much compromised if the capacitors are switched. Normal 
Figure 8.34: Active-passive RIAA stage with switched gain by Peter Baxandall

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 257
practice is that the smallest capacitor is permanently in circuit so it can be mounted right 
on the rear of the input socket. A continuously variable loading capacitance could be made 
with an old-style tuning capacitor (two-section for stereo); looking back they were marvels 
of mass-produced precision engineering. The maximum value in an old medium-wave radio 
is often a rather convenient 500 pF. This would look well cool but naturally takes up a lot of 
space, and the variable-bootstrapping of a fixed capacitor (see the variable-frequency tone 
control in  Chapter 15 ) would be much more compact. 
 The exact nature of this resonance does not have a consensus in the hifi community. There is 
also the possibility of what is usually called the ‘cantilever resonance’ which is a mechanical 
resonance between the effective tip mass of the stylus and the compliance of the vinyl it is 
tracking, the latter making up the spring part of the classic mass-and-spring system. The 
effective tip mass of the stylus is contributed to by the mass of the diamond tip, the cantilever, 
and the generator element on the other end, which may be a piece of iron, a magnet, or coils; 
it usually ranges from 0.2 to 0.7 milligrams. There is also the question of the contribution of 
the cantilever compliance, and the possibility of a torsional resonance of the cantilever [31]. 
You are probably thinking by now that this is a mass of electromechanical compromises that 
should be left alone, and you are probably right. 
 Not everyone agrees. A scheme for cancelling the effects of the cantilever resonance with a 
sophisticated active filter was put forward by Steven van Raalte in  Linear Audio Volume 3 [32]. 
A slightly earlier attempt, in 1953 [33], simply put a series LC circuit across the cartridge output. 
 MM cartridge–preampliﬁ er interaction 
 One often hears that there can be problems due to interaction between the impedance of the 
cartridge and the negative-feedback network. Most commentators are extremely vague as to what 
this actually means, but according to Tomlinson Holman [34], the factual basis is that it used to 
be all too easy to design an RIAA stage, if you are using only two or three discrete transistors, 
Figure 8.35: The typical effect of changing the loading capacitance on an MM cartridge

258 Chapter 8
in which the NFB factor is falling significantly with frequency in the upper reaches of the audio 
band, perhaps due to excessive dominant-pole compensation to achieve HF stability (on the other 
hand, the amount of feedback is increasing with frequency due to RIAA equalisation). Assuming 
a series-feedback configuration is being used, this means that the input impedance will fall with 
frequency, which is equivalent to having a capacitive input impedance. This interacts with the 
cartridge inductance and allegedly can cause a resonant peak in the frequency response, in the 
same way that cable capacitance or a deliberately added load capacitance can do. 
 For this reason a flat-response buffer stage between the cartridge and the first stage 
performing RIAA equalisation was sometimes advocated. One design including this feature 
was the Cambridge Audio P50, which used a Darlington emitter-follower as a buffer; with 
this approach there is an obvious danger of compromising the noise performance because 
there is no gain to lift the signal level above the noise floor of the next stage. 
 MM cartridge DC and AC coupling 
 Some uninformed commentators have said that there should be no DC blocking capacitor 
between the cartridge and the preamplifier. This is insane. Keep DC out of your cartridge. 
The signal currents are tiny (for MM cartridges 5 mV in 47 kΩ  106 nA, while for MC 
ones 245 μV in 100 Ω  2.45 μA – a good deal higher) and even a small DC bias current 
could interfere with linearity. I am not aware of any published work on how cartridge 
distortion is affected by DC bias currents, but I think it pretty clear they will not improve 
things and may make them very much worse. Large currents might partially demagnetise 
the magnet, be it moving or otherwise, ruining the cartridge. Even larger currents due to 
circuit faults might set fire to the coils, ruining the cartridge even more effectively. You 
may call a lack of blocking capacitors high-end, but I call it highly irresponsible. 
If I had a £15,000 cartridge (and they do exist, by Koetsu and Clearaudio) I would probably put 
two blocking capacitors in series. Or three.
 Switched-gain ﬂ at stages 
 In the earlier parts of this chapter we saw that the appropriate gain (at 1 kHz) for an MM 
input with pretensions to quality is between 30 and 40 dB, giving maximum inputs at 
1 kHz of 316 and 100 mVrms respectively. Lower gains give an inconveniently low output 
signal, and a greater headroom loss at HF due to the need for a lower HF correction pole 
frequency. Higher gains give too low a maximum input. 
 The nominal output for 5 mVrms input (1 kHz) from a 30 dB stage is 158 mVrms, and 
from a 40 dB stage is 500 mVrms. Bearing in mind that the line signals between pieces of 
equipment are, in these digital days usually in the range 12 Vrms, it is obvious that both 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 259
158 mVrms and 500 mVrms are too low. If we put a fixed gain stage after the MM input 
stage, it will overload first and the maximum inputs just quoted are no longer valid. It is 
therefore desirable to make such a stage switchable in gain, to cope with differing conditions 
of cartridge sensitivity and recorded level. One of the gain options must be unity (0 dB) if 
the maximum MM inputs are to be preserved; having less than unity gain is pointless as 
the MM stage will clip first. It would of course be possible to have continuously variable 
gain controlled by a pot, but this brings in difficult issues of stereo level matching (these are 
described in  Chapter 13 on volume controls). It is not, in my opinion, necessary to have finer 
control of the post-MM-input gain than 5 dB steps. 
 If we are dealing with just MM inputs, then not many gain options are required. If we assume 
a 30 dB (1 kHz) MM stage with its nominal 158 mVrms output, then we need 6.3 times 
or 16 dB of gain to raise that level to 1 Vrms. This suggests that gain options of 0 dB, 
5 dB, 10 dB, and 15 dB are all that are needed, with the lower gains allowing for more 
sensitive cartridges and elevated recording levels. 
 However, it will be seen in  Chapter 12 that MC cartridges have a much wider spread of 
sensitivities than the MM variety, and if the MM input stage followed by the flat switched-
gain stage are going to be used to perform the RIAA equalisation after a flat 30 dB MC 
head amp, a further 20 dB gain option in the switched-gain stage is required to ensure 
that even the most insensitive MC cartridges can produce a full 1 Vrms nominal output. 
 The stage in  Figure 8.36 is derived from my Elektor 2012 preamp [26] and gives those gain 
options. The AC negative feedback is tapped from the divider R51R60, which is made up 
Figure 8.36: A ﬂ at gain stage with accurate switched gains of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 dB. 
Resistor pairs are used to get the exact gains wanted, and to reduce the effect of tolerances

260 Chapter 8
of pairs of resistors to achieve the exact gain required and to reduce the effect of the resistor 
tolerances. The DC feedback for the opamp is always through R50 to prevent the opamp 
hitting the rails when switching the gain; the blocking capacitor C50 is more than large 
enough to prevent any frequency response irregularities in the audio band. Assuming the 
source impedance is reasonably low, an LM4562 will give better noise and distortion results 
than a 5532 section. 
 The correct setting for the gain switch can be worked out by considering cartridge sensitivity 
specs and recording levels, but the latter are usually unknown, so some form of level indicator 
is very useful when setting up. A bar-graph meter seems a bit over the top for a facility that 
will not be used very often, and a single LED indication makes more sense. For this reason 
the Log Law Level LED was developed, giving about as much level information as can be 
had from one LED. It is fully described in  Chapter 23 on metering. It is desirable that any 
level-indication can be switched off as not everyone thinks that flashing lights add to the 
musical experience. 
 Subsonic ﬁ lters 
 In the earlier parts of this chapter we have seen that the worst subsonic disturbances occur 
in the 24 Hz region, due to disk warps, and are about 8 dB less at 10 Hz. We have also 
seen that the IEC Amendment gives only 14 dB of attenuation at 4 Hz, and in any case is 
often omitted by the manufacturer or switched out by the user. It is therefore important 
to provide authoritative subsonic filtering. What needs to be settled is what order filter to 
use, because some people at least will be concerned about the audibility of LF phase shifts, 
and how far into the audio band the filter should intrude. There is nothing approaching a 
consensus on either point, so it can be a wise move to configure the subsonic filter so it can 
be switched out. 
 The third-order filter already described in this chapter also did the job of implementing 
the IEC Amendment, so it did not have one of the classic filter characteristics. All the 
filters described here do just the filtering job and it is assumed that the IEC Amendment is 
implemented elsewhere, if at all.  
 High-pass filters used for RIAA subsonic are typically of the second-order or third-
order Butterworth (maximally flat) configuration, rolling off at rates of 12 dB/octave and 
18 dB/octave respectively, as shown in  Figure 8.37 . Fourth order 24 dB/octave filters 
are much less common, presumably due to worries about the possible audibility of rapid 
phase changes at the very bottom of the audio spectrum. The Butterworth response is but 
one of many possible filter alignments; the Bessel response gives a slower roll-off, but 
aims for linear phase – i.e. a constant delay versus frequency – and so reproduces the 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 261
shape of transients better. Other filter alignments such as Chebyshev give faster initial 
roll-offs than the Butterworth, but they do so at the expense of ripples in the passband or 
stopband gain which is not helpful if you are aiming for a ruler-flat response after RIAA 
equalisation. 
 A very handy filter configuration is the well-known Sallen and Key type; it has drawbacks 
when used as a low-pass handling high frequencies (the response comes back up at RF 
due to the non-zero opamp output impedance) but works very well for our purposes 
here. A second-order Sallen and Key is simple to design; the two series capacitors C1 
and C2 are made equal and R2 is made twice the value of R1. Such a filter with a 3 dB 
point at 20 Hz is shown in  Figure 8.37a . Other roll-off frequencies can be obtained 
simply by scaling the component values while keeping C1 equal to C2 and R2 twice R1. 
The response is 24.0 dB down at 5 Hz, by which time the 12 dB/octave slope is well-
established, and we are well protected against disk warps. It is however only 12.3 dB 
down at 10 Hz, which gives little protection against arm-resonance problems. Above the 
3 dB roll-off point the response is still 0.78 dB down at 30 Hz, which is intruding a 
bit into the sort of frequencies we want to keep. We have to conclude that a second-order 
filter really does not bifurcate the condiment, and the faster roll-off of a third-order filter 
is preferable. 
 Third-order filters are a little more complex. Some versions are made up of a second-order 
filter cascaded with a first-order roll-off, using two opamp sections. It can however be done 
with just one, as in  Figure 8.37b , which is a third-order Butterworth filter also with a 3 dB 
point at 20 Hz. The resistor value ratios are now a less friendly 2.53:1.00:17.55, and the 
circuit shown uses the nearest E24 values to this – which by happy chance come out as E12 
values. The frequency response is shown in  Figure 8.38 , where it can be seen to be 18.6 dB 
down at 10 Hz, which should keep out any arm-resonance frequencies. It is 36.0 dB down at 
5 Hz so disk warp spurii won’t have a chance. The 30 Hz response is now only down by an 
insignificant 0.37 dB, which demonstrates that how a third-order filter is much better than 
Figure 8.37: Subsonic ﬁ lters: a) second-order, and b) third-order Butterworth high-pass ﬁ lters, 
both 3 dB down at 20 Hz

262 Chapter 8
a second-order filter for this application. As before, other roll-off frequencies can be had by 
scaling the component values while keeping the resistor ratios the same. 
 When dealing with frequency-dependant networks like filters you need to keep an eye on the 
input impedance, because it can drop to unexpectedly low values, putting excessive loading 
on the stage upstream and degrading its linearity. In a high-pass Sallen and Key filter, the 
input impedance is high at low frequencies but falls with increasing frequency. In the third-
order version, it tends to the value of R1 in parallel with R3, which here is 10.6 kΩ. This 
should not worry the previous stage. 
 Because of the large capacitances, the noise generated by the resistors in a high-pass filter of 
this sort is usually well below the opamp noise. The capacitances do not, of course, generate 
any noise themselves. With the values used here, SPICE simulation shows that the resistors 
produce 125.0 dBu of noise at the output (22 kHz bandwidth, 25 °C). The use of the 
LM4562 will reduce voltage-follower CM distortion compared with the 5534/5532, but may 
be noisier in some cases due to the higher current noise of the LM4562. 
 Capacitor distortion in electrolytics is (or should be) by now a well-known phenomenon. It 
is perhaps less well known that non-electrolytics can also generate distortion in filters like 
these. This has nothing to do with Subjectivist musicality, but is all too real and measurable. 
Figure 8.38: Frequency response of a third-order Butterworth subsonic ﬁ lter, 3 dB down at 20 Hz.

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 263
Details of the problem are given in  Chapter 2 , where it is concluded that only NP0 ceramic, 
polystyrene, and polypropylene capacitors can be regarded as free of this effect. The 
capacitor sizes needed for subsonic filters are large, if impedances and hence noise are to 
be kept low, which means it has to be polypropylene. Anything larger than 470 nF gets to 
be big and expensive, so that is the value used here. 220 nF polypropylene is substantially 
smaller and about half the price. There is more information on this, and on high-pass filters in 
general, in  Chapter 6 on filters. 
 Since most of the low frequency disturbances from a disc are due to up-and-down motion, 
they are reproduced as two out-of-phase signals by a stereo pickup cartridge. It has often been 
suggested that severe rumble overlapping the audio band can be best dealt with by reducing 
the stereo signal to mono at low frequencies, cancelling the disturbances but leaving the bass, 
which is usually panned towards the middle, relatively unaffected. This is usually done by 
cross-feeding the outputs of two low-pass filters between the channels. Several circuits have 
been published to perform this; one example is reference [35]. 
 Ultrasonic ﬁ lters 
 Scratches and groove debris create clicks that have a large high-frequency content, some of it 
ultrasonic and liable to cause slew rate and intermodulation problems further down the audio 
chain. The transients from scratches can easily exceed the normal signal level. It is often 
considered desirable to filter this out as soon as possible (though of course some people are 
only satisfied with radio-transmitter frequency responses). 
 If an MM input stage is provided with an HF correction pole, in the form of an RC first-
order roll-off after the opamp, this in itself provides some protection against ultrasonics as its 
attenuation continues to increase with frequency and it is inherently linear. The opamp ahead 
of it naturally does not benefit from this; while it might be desirable to put some ultrasonic 
filtering in front of the first active stage, in practice it is going to be very hard to do this 
without degrading the noise performance. 
 A true ultrasonic filter could be a passive LC design, but inductors are not much loved in 
audio. A more likely choice is a second or third-order active filter, probably opamp-based, 
but if Sallen and Key filters are used then a discrete emitter-follower is an option, and this 
should be free from the bandwidth and slew rate limitations of opamps. If an ultrasonic filter 
is incorporated it is usually second-order, very likely due to misplaced fears of perceptible 
phase effects at the top of the audio band. If a Sallen and Key filter with an opamp is used, be 
aware that the response does not keep going down forever but comes back up due to the non-
zero output impedance of the opamp at high frequencies; the multiple-feedback (MFB) filter 
configuration is free from this problem. The design of suitable low-pass filters to remove 
ultrasonics is fully explained in  Chapter 6 on filters. 

264 Chapter 8
 The combination of a subsonic filter and an ultrasonic filter is sometimes called a bandwidth 
definition filter. 
 Combining subsonic and ultrasonic ﬁ lters in one stage 
 An obstacle to the inclusion of an ultrasonic filter is the extra cost and power consumption of 
another filter stage. This difficulty can be resolved by combining it with a subsonic filter in the 
same stage. Combined filters also have the advantage that the signal now passes through one 
opamp rather than two, and can be extremely useful if you only have one opamp section left. 
 This cunning plan is workable only because the high-pass and low-pass turnover frequencies 
are widely different.  Figure 8.39 shows the third-order Butterworth subsonic filter combined 
with a second-order 50 kHz Butterworth low-pass filter; the response of the combination is 
exactly the same as expected for each separately. The low-pass filter is cautiously designed to 
prevent significant loss in the audio band, and has a 3 dB point at 50 kHz, giving very close 
to 0.0 dB at 20 kHz. The response is 12.6 dB down at 100 kHz and 24.9 dB at 200 kHz. 
C1 is made up of two 2n2 capacitors in parallel. 
 Note that the mid band gain of the combined filter is 0.15 dB rather than exactly unity. The loss 
occurs because the series combination of C1, C2 and C3, together with C5, form a capacitive 
potential divider with this attenuation, and this is one reason why the turnover frequencies need 
to be widely separated for filter combining to work. If they were closer together then C1, C2, C3 
would be smaller, C5 would be bigger, and the capacitive divider loss would be greater. 
 Scratch ﬁ lters 
 In what might be called the First Age of Vinyl, a fully-equipped preamplifier would certainly 
have a switchable low-pass filter, usually called, with brutal frankness, the ‘scratch’ filter. It 
would have a roll-off slope of at least 12 dB/octave, faster than the 6 dB/octave maximum

slope of the tone-control stage, and commencing roll-off at a much higher frequency. It was 
aimed at suppressing, or at any rate dulling and hopefully rendering acceptable, not just 
record surface noise and the inevitable ticks and clicks, but also HF distortion. This function 
is quite separate from that of an ultrasonic filter, and the turnover frequency is very much in 
the audio band, usually in the range 3–10 kHz. 
 The more highly-specified preamps would have two, three, or more alternative filter 
frequencies, and the really posh models had variable filter slope as well. The fact that the 
need was felt for some really quite sophisticated filtering to smooth the listening experience 
does rather emphasise the inherent vulnerability of a mechanical groove for delivering music. 
Now we seem to be in the Second Age of Vinyl, a reassessment of this once-abandoned bit of 
technology would seem to be timely. 
 Historically scratch filters were often passive LC configurations as that was much cheaper 
than putting in an extra valve to make an active filter. A modern scratch filter, if such a thing 
was desired, would almost certainly be an active filter. Some versatile scratch filters with 
variable slope are described in  Chapter 9 on archival disc transcription; the design of low-
pass active filters in general is explained in  Chapter 5 on filters. 
 A practical MM ampliﬁ er: #1 
 The closely observed designs given here are intended to demonstrate the various techniques 
discussed in this chapter, and  Chapter 11 on MM amplifier noise and distortion. The MM 
amplifier shown in  Figure 8.40 is based on the MM section of the Signal Transfer MM/
MC phono amplifier [36]. This practical design includes cartridge loading capacitor C1, 
input DC blocking capacitor C2 and DC drain R1 which stops mighty thumps being caused 
by charge left on C2 if the input is unplugged. R1 in parallel with R2 makes up the 47 kΩ 
resistive input load. I have used this circuit for many years and it has given complete 
satisfaction to many customers, though in the light of the latest knowledge it could be 
further optimised to economise on precision capacitors. It includes a typical subsonic filter 
which is designed with a slow initial roll-off that implements the IEC Amendment, so a 
separate network is not required. A 5534A is used at the input stage to get the best possible 
noise performance. A 5534A without external compensation has a minimum stable closed-
loop gain of about three times; that is close to the gain at 20 kHz here, so a touch of extra 
compensation is required for stability. The capacitor used here is 4.7 pF, which experience 
shows is both definitely required and also gives completely reliable stability. This is tested 
by sweeping a large signal from 20 kHz downwards; single-frequency testing can miss this 
sort of problem. 
 The resistors have been made more accurate by combining two E24 values. In this 
case they are used in series and no attempt was made to try and get the values equal for

the maximum reduction of tolerance errors. That statistical work was done at a later date. 
The Configuration-A RIAA network capacitances are made up of multiple 1% polystyrene 
capacitors for improved accuracy. Thus for the five 10 nF capacitors that make up C1, the 
standard deviation (square root of variance) increases by the square root of five, while total 
capacitance has increased five times, and we have inexpensively built an otherwise costly 
0.44% close-tolerance 50 nF capacitor. You will note that 5  10 nF capacitors are required, 
whereas a Configuration-C RIAA network can do the same job with 4  10 nF. 
 C2 is essentially composed of three 4n7 components and its tolerance is improved by √3, to 
0.58%. Its final value is tweaked by the addition of C15. An HF correction pole R8, R9, C13 
is fitted; here the resultant loss of HF headroom is only 0.5 dB at 20 kHz, which I think I can 
live with. 
 Immediately after the RIAA stage is the subsonic filter, a third-order Butterworth high-
pass filter which also implements the IEC Amendment by using a value for R11  R12 
which is lower than that for maximal Butterworth flatness. The stage also buffers the HF 
correction pole R8, R9, C13 from later circuitry, and gives the capability to drive a 600 Ω 
load, if you can find one. A version of this design, using appropriate precision components, 
is manufactured by the Signal Transfer Company in bare PCB, kit, and fully built and tested 
formats [36]. 
 A practical MM ampliﬁ er: #2 
 The MM/MC input system shown in  Figure 8.41 is based on my recent Elektor preamp 
design [26], which was a no-holds-barred attempt at getting the best possible performance. 
The input is switchable between a phono socket for the connection of MM cartridges, and an 
MC head amplifier with a flat gain of 30 dB. A switched-gain stage allows every MC and 
MM cartridge on the market to be catered for. 
 The MM stage uses Configuration-A (the work on optimising RIAA networks not having 
been done at the time) and the gain is 30 dB at 1 kHz using 5  10 nF polystyrene 
capacitors to obtain the required value and to improve RIAA accuracy (because random 
errors in the capacitor values tend to cancel). Multiple RIAA resistors R22, R23 and R24, 
R25 are used to improve accuracy in the same way, and this time the paralleled values were 
optimised by being made as near equal as possible. The value of C12 is large at 220 μF as 
the IEC Amendment is not implemented in this stage, and tweaking the IEC Amendment to 
compensate for its less-than-infinite value (see earlier in this chapter) was not considered 
necessary. The 30 dB (1 kHz) gain of the MM stage requires that the RIAA characteristic 
is corrected at HF by R26, R27, and C22. Two near-equal resistors are again used to improve 
accuracy; C22 is polystyrene to avoid capacitor distortion. 

MM inputs: levels and RIAA equalisation 269
 A 5534A is used here for IC3 as it is quieter than half a 5532, and considerably quieter than 
an LM4562 with its higher current noise. The high inductance of an MM cartridge makes low 
current noise important. 
 A load-synthesis circuit IC4 is used to make an electronic version of the required 47 kΩ 
loading resistor from the 1M resistor R16. The Johnson noise of the resistor is however  not 
emulated and so noise due to the rising impedance of the MM cartridge inductance is much 
reduced. R16 is made to appear as 47 kΩ by driving its bottom end in anti-phase to the signal 
at the top. IC4B prevents loading on the MM input while IC4A is the inverting stage. Paired 
resistors R19, R20 and R17, R18 are used to improve the gain accuracy of the inverting 
stage, and therefore the accuracy of the synthesised impedance. There is much more on this 
technique in Chapter 11. 
 The subsonic filter is a two-stage third-order Butterworth high-pass filter that is 3 dB at 
20 Hz, with paired resistors again used to improve accuracy. It is a two-stage filter in that 
it consists of an under-damped second-order high-pass stage (C40, C41, R40R43 etc.) 
combined with a first-order stage (C43, R44, R45) to give the maximally-flat Butterworth 
response. My previous preamp designs have used a single-stage third-order Butterworth, but I 
have found the two-stage configuration is preferred when seeking the best possible distortion 
performance [37]. An LM4562 is used in the filter as it significantly reduces distortion and its 
higher current noise makes a negligible contribution to the overall noise performance. 
 The IEC Amendment is an extra LF roll-off that was added to the RIAA spec at a later date. 
Most people regard it as unwelcome, so it is sometimes just omitted. Here it can be switched 
in by placing an extra resistance R46 across the subsonic filter resistances R44, R45. This is 
something of an approximation, but saves an opamp stage and is accurate to ± 0.1 dB down to 
29 Hz. Below this the subsonic filter roll-off begins and the Amendment accuracy is irrelevant. 
 The switched-gain stage comes last in the signal path. This stage allows every MC and 
MM cartridge currently on the market, including the very low output MC models made 
by Audio Note, to receive the amount of gain required for optimal noise and headroom. 
The gain stage is fully described earlier in this chapter; gain is varied in 5 dB steps by a 
switch SW3 which selects the desired tap on the negative-feedback divider R51R60. 
Each divider step is made with two resistors, with their values as close as possible, to get 
the exact value and improve accuracy. R35 provides continuity of DC feedback when the 
switch is altered. 
 Setting the correct gain can be done by reference to cartridge sensitivities and so on, but it 
is far more convenient to have some sort of level indication for guidance, hence the meter 
output shown in  Figure 8.41 . The Log Law Level LED (LLLL) is my attempt to get as much 
useful information as possible from a single LED; it is to the best of my knowledge, a new 
idea, and is fully described in  Chapter 23 on metering.

 Moving-magnet inputs : 
archival and non-standard equalisation 
 Archival transcription 
 This chapter deals with the differing requirements for reproducing discs, or indeed 
cylinders, that are not made to the microgroove standard. The subject of archival 
transcription is a large and complex one, and here I concentrate on the electronics. For disc 
replay there are many factors relating to stylus size and shape, tracking weight, etc. which 
we cannot explore here. 
 The major electronic problem is replay equalisation. Forget about having one universally-
accepted equalisation, like the RIAA characteristic for microgroove discs. As you have 
seen in earlier chapters, implementing the RIAA both accurately and economically is quite 
a challenge. Early discs used a wide variety of equalisations and so an archival phono 
preamplifier must be able to provide all these in an accurate manner, though there is no need 
for great economy in specialised equipment that will only be made in very small numbers. 
 Although the media involved is always monaural, a stereo cartridge is normally used for 
transcription, and archival preamplifiers are likewise stereo, with a facility for summing 
varying proportions of the two channels to create a final mono output. This is because the two 
walls of a mono groove are unlikely to be identical and the best results may be obtained by 
summing them unequally. 
 The preservation and distribution of archival material in analogue formats requires that it be 
replayed with the highest quality attainable and converted to digital. The most comprehensive 
book I am aware of on the general subject is the  Manual Of Analogue Sound Restoration 
Techniques [1] by Peter Copeland [2]. 
 Coarse groove discs 
 The great majority of the material for archival transcription is represented by coarse groove 
discs, often referred to as ‘78s’ because they were designed to rotate at 78 rpm rather than 
the 33 rpm of microgroove discs. They were produced from 1898 until the mid-fifties, 

274 Chapter 9
and were composed of mineral powders in an organic binder (‘shellac’) which gave much 
higher surface noise than the vinyl used for microgroove records. Playing time was limited 
to three minutes, later extended to six.  Table 9.1 summarises the radical changes in groove 
dimensions required to get 22 minutes playing time from microgroove discs – completely 
different styli are required.   
 Wax cylinders 
 As I have made clear, I think vinyl is an obsolete technology. However, if you’re going to be 
retro, I say no half-measures. The first medium for recording and playback was tin-foil on a 
cylinder, introduced by Edison in 1877, but the results were poor even by the standards of 
the day. Wax cylinders proved much better. A standard cylinder system was agreed by Edison 
Records, Columbia Phonograph, others in the late 1880s. These cylinders were 4 inches (10 cm) 
long, 2¼ inches in diameter, and played for about two minutes. The grooves made 100 turns 
per lateral inch. 
 Disc records appeared in 1901, first 10-inch then, later, 12-inch. These played for about 
three and four minutes respectively, but had poor quality compared with contemporary 
cylinders. To meet the competition on playing time, Edison introduced the Amberol 
cylinder in 1909, which increased the maximum playing time to 4.5 minutes, turning at 
160 rpm, by increasing the groove density to 200 turns per lateral inch. Blue Amberol 
cylinders came later, with a celluloid playing surface on a core of plaster of Paris. 
Despite these developments, discs decisively defeated cylinders in what must have been 
the first audio format war, though Edison continued to produce new cylinders until 
October 1929. 
 Wax cylinders have certain advantages. The format is inherently linear-tracking, which 
eliminates all the problems of angular alignment and stylus side-force. A worm gear is

used to move the stylus in alignment with the grooves on the cylinder, whereas disc replay 
uses the grooves to pull the stylus across the playing surface, creating a side-force and 
increasing groove wear. The speed of the stylus in the groove is constant, which eliminates 
the end-of-side distortion on the inner grooves of discs. Around 1900, it was acknowledged 
that cylinders in general had significantly better audio quality than discs, but by 1910 disc 
technology had improved and the difference disappeared. 
 Probably the greatest disadvantage of cylinders compared with discs is the space they take 
up. The volume on the inside of the cylinder has no use beyond supporting the player surface. 
Discs, however, can be stacked in a compact pile with no wasted space. 
 Various one-off cylinder replay machines have been built for the transcription of old 
recordings. These include the Archéophone [3] designed by Henri Chamoux, in 1998, and a 
cylinder player built by BBC engineers in the early 1990s. The latter used a linear-tracking 
arm from a contemporary turntable and an Ortofon cartridge. It could use a wide range of 
different equalisations and was used to transfer archival content to DAT tapes. Cylinders can 
also be ‘replayed’ by optical scanning, which has the great advantage that it can cause no 
groove damage. 
 It is impossible to give a single correct equalisation characteristic for the replay of cylinders. 
The recordings were made acoustically, without any standard electrical equalisation being 
applied as would later be done as part of the RIAA standard, and each case must be decided 
on its merits. Variable equalisation preamplifiers exist, but are rare and expensive. There is 
information on how to build them later in this chapter. 
 It is, as you might imagine, now extremely unusual for music to be released in cylinder format. A 
notable (and probably unique) exception being the release of the track ‘Sewer’ in 2010 by the 
British steampunk band The Men That Will Not Be Blamed For Nothing [4]. This was a very 
limited edition indeed; only 40 cylinders were produced and only 30 were put on sale. 
 Non-standard replay equalisation 
 The familiar RIAA curve for microgroove records has three basic corner frequencies, f3, f4 and 
f5, plus f2 if you count the IEC amendment. This is the Lipshitz numbering convention. Early 
replay equalisation was simpler than this, with only f4 specified as the ‘bass turnover frequency’ 
below which the signal received bass boost at 6 dB/octave. 
 The RIAA curve is usually specified in terms of its time-constants. These have the 
Lipshitz names of T3, T4 and T5, corresponding to the turnover frequencies f3, f4, and f5, 
and their values are 3180 μs (f3  50.05 Hz), 318 μs (f4  500.5 Hz) and 75 μs (f5  
2112 Hz). The time-constant T2 is the IEC amendment of 7960 μs (f2  20.02 Hz) but as 
we saw in  Chapter 8 , this merely acts as a feeble substitute for a subsonic filter, and is of 

276 Chapter 9
no interest here as it is only intended to be used with microgroove (LP) discs. Any preamp 
intended for archival transcription is almost certain to have a proper subsonic filter, often 
with a variable cut-off frequency. Non-standard equalisation is more often defined in 
terms of the frequencies rather than the time-constants. The two are easily interconverted; 
see Equations 9.1 and 9.2.

 All cartridges (except for very rare strain-gauge types) respond to the velocity of the 
stylus, and not its displacement. If a recording is made to suit this, then the groove 
amplitude will continuously decrease from LF to HF; this is called constant-velocity 
recording. This causes two problems: excessively large groove amplitude at LF which 
limits playing time and at some point becomes untrackable, and excessively small groove 
amplitude at HF so surface noise becomes a problem. Early recording equalisation, 
from the mid-1920s, tackled the first problem by introducing a 6 dB/octave LF roll-off 
when recording, starting at a set frequency, f4, and giving constant-amplitude recording 
below that. An example is curve A in Figure 9.1, which corresponds to the Radiofunken 
characteristic in  Table 9.2 . In the literature, f4 is often called the ‘bass turnover frequency’. 
To undo this at replay, complementary LF boost had to be provided, starting at the same 
frequency. This boost had to be curtailed before sub-sonic frequencies were reached, or 
record warps and turntable rumble would be grotesquely exaggerated. Therefore replay 
Figure 9.1: Early equalisation systems used curves like A, later ones like B added de-emphasis to 
attenuate surface noise. f5 is sometimes speciﬁ ed in terms of the attenuation at 10 kHz

MM inputs: non-standard equalisation 277
equalisation always had another frequency, f3, where the gain flattened out; I have 
used 50 Hz in Figure 9.1. Since f3 was not part of any official recording characteristic 
until about 1940, it seems to have been left to the judgement of those designing replay 
amplifiers. 
 Later, from the mid 1930s, the second problem of excessively small groove amplitude at 
HF was addressed by increasing the HF content recorded. This is called pre-emphasis and 
relies on the fact that an audio signal has relatively low levels at HF. At replay, HF cut 
(de-emphasis) is applied to undo the pre-emphasis, and this attenuates the surface noise 
(see curve B in Figure 9.1, which corresponds to the Decca 1934 characteristic in  Table 9.3 ). 
In the literature, f5 is often called the ‘treble transition frequency’. The HF cut curve also 
dropped at 6 dB/octave, for ease of implementation, except in the case of Decca’s FFRR 
(full frequency range recording) records which fell at a 3 dB/octave slope. I have found no 
information on how this was supposed to be implemented – presumably it was approximated 
by using extra overlapping time-constants. See my crossover book [5] for how to do this with 
varying degrees of accuracy. 
 There were dozens of different recording characteristics used and choosing the corresponding 
replay characteristic is a significant problem in itself. The history of even one record label can 
be complicated with different characteristics used in different years and, according to Gary 
Galo, sometimes even on different sides of the same disc. The histories of the characteristics

are not universally agreed and are subject to some debate, much of which can be found on the 
internet. In  Tables 9.2 and  9.3 I have done my best to give some generally accepted examples, 
including the extremes, so we can see what range of frequencies is required in an archival 
preamp. It is far from comprehensive, and much greater depth of information can be found in 
Peter Copeland’s book [1] (other useful references are [6] and [7]). In most of the literature, 
the frequencies f4 and f5 are used rather than time-constants. Sometime f5 is not quoted 
directly, but in terms of the attenuation at 10 kHz with respect to 1 kHz. In difficult cases the 
only thing to do is to judge by ear the correct characteristic to use, and this has implications 
that will surface later. 
 The entry for ‘acoustic gramophone’ in Table 9.2 indicates that no equalisation at all 
was used, giving a straight constant-velocity characteristic. This was suitable for purely 
mechanical reproducers such as the Orthophonic Victrola with its folded exponential horn. 
Note the entries marked ‘inconsistent’. 
 Tables 9.2 and  9.3 show that f4 must be variable at least between 150 and 750 Hz, and  Table 9.3 
shows that f5 must be at least variable between 1590 and 5500 Hz. Having decided on f3, 
f4 and f5 you have to implement them. In  Chapter 8 I stated firmly that RIAA equalisation 
should be done in one active series-feedback stage, and demonstrated that all other approaches 
involving partly-passive RIAA introduced serious compromises in noise or headroom, or both. 
The downside is that the active one-stage method is much more difficult to design because of 
the interacting values in the RIAA feedback network.

 For archival transcription the priorities are different. If f3, f4 and f5 are combined in 
one network, changing one of them requires recalculating the whole network and then 
changing every component in it. This is obviously impractical, and the only answer is 
to use some form of partly-passive configuration that allows the time-constants to be set 
independently. Increased electronic noise is not a problem because it will be well below 
the surface noise of ancient media. Headroom is likewise unlikely to be an issue because 
of the generally low recording levels, and the ease of including a flat variable-gain stage 
in a partly-passive configuration. 
 Figure 9.2 shows a typical passive-passive equalisation circuit (so-called because both 
equalisation stages are passive and the amplifiers are separate). It follows the circuitry 
discussed in  Chapter 8 by having a gain of 30 dB at 1 kHz, so 5 mV in gives 158 mV 
out.  The values of the equalisation components are taken from Gary Galow’s  Linear Audio 
article [8] for reasons that will become clear; they give an RIAA response accurate to  
±0.02 dB. As noted, the IEC amendment f2 is unlikely to be used, but if required it can be 
implemented by making C0 equal to 79.05 μF as shown. If f2 is not required, C0 should be 
220 μF or 470 μF. In this circuit f3 is set by the time-constant T3, the product of (R2  R3) 
and C1. Likewise f4 is set by the time-constant T4, the product of R3 and C1. The treble 
turnover frequency f5 is set simply by R6 and C2; the output must not be significantly loaded, 
and in many cases a buffer stage will be needed. Here it is very clear that 7.5 kΩ and 10 nF 
give a T5 of 75 μs, so f5 is 2112 Hz. If f5 is not used then R6 and C2 are simply omitted. It is 
normal practice to make the time constants switchable. Making them fully variable by using 
ganged pots would degrade the matching of the stereo channels. 
 Sometimes you have to judge by ear the ‘correct’ characteristic to use, or at least one that 
gives satisfactory results. When doing this, it is very convenient if the gain stays the same 
at 1 kHz while the frequency extremes are altered. This does not occur with the simple

circuit of  Figure 9.2 , and great credit goes to Gary Galow and Mike Shields for devising 
the circuit in  Figure 9.3 [8]. The values here give the standard RIAA curve, to allow easy 
checking of the circuit operation; when simulated using 5534s it is accurate to ±0.02 dB. 
The circuit works by summing the path through R5, which sets the 1 kHz gain, with the 
path through R4, which sets f3 and f4. Once again it is easy to see that R6  7.5 kΩ and C2  
10 nF gives a T5 of 75 us and thus an f5 of 2112 Hz. The equations linking f3 and f4 with 
the related component values are more complicated but are fully explained in [8]. 
  This circuit is purely an equaliser and not an amplifier; it has unity gain at 1 kHz. Be aware that 
adding a C0 in series with R0 will  not give an accurate IEC amendment f2, because of the two 
paths. 
 Scratch ﬁ lters 
 In the First Age of Vinyl (say 1948 to 1983 if we restrict ourselves to microgroove records), 
hifi preamplifiers commonly included a switchable low-pass filter, called, with no attempt 
at circumlocution, the scratch filter. The roll-off slope would be 12 or 18 dB/octave, 
commencing roll-off in the range 3–10 kHz. It was intended for the suppression, not just of 
ticks and clicks from scratched discs, but also the smoothing out of record surface noise and 
the dulling of the inevitable HF distortion. Upmarket preamplifiers would have two or more 
switched filter frequencies, and switchable or variable filter slope as well. The need for such 
versatile filtering is clear when transcribing archival discs in less-than-perfect condition. Note 
that a scratch filter is quite distinct from an ultrasonic filter (see  Chapter 8 ), the latter only 
operating outside the audio band. 
Figure 9.3: Partly-passive equalisation with constant level at 1 kHz

 Variable-slope scratch ﬁ lters: LC solutions 
 Making a variable-slope filter is not that straightforward, because the natural slopes you get 
with resistors and capacitors are 6 dB per octave. Using active filters gives access to final 
slopes with 12, 18, 24 or more dB per octave, but intermediate slopes are usually only found 
in the transitions between flat and the ultimate roll-off slope. 
 A popular way of achieving variable-slope back in the valve era involved an LC filter 
bypassed by a variable resistance. A classic example of this approach, published in  Wireless 
World in 1956 [9], is shown in  Figure 9.4 . If RV1 is absent, there is a deep notch centred on 
10 kHz, but adding it abolishes the notch and gives the response shown in the bottom trace of 
 Figure 9.5 . 
 Adjusting RV1 to steadily reduce the resistance across L1, C2 gives a set of responses that 
have more or less the same turnover frequency (3 dB at about 3 kHz) but reducing slope. If 
we measure the average slopes across the octave 5–10 kHz, we get  Table 9.4 , which shows a

handy variation in slope from 4.5 to almost 18 dB/octave. As revealed in  Figure 9.5 , the filter 
has 6 dB loss in the passband, which is not ideal. 
 The full published circuit included switching of all three capacitors to give nominal turnover 
frequencies of 5, 7, and 10 kHz, which of course means a rather clumsy 6-way switch for 
stereo use. It had a 1 H inductor, and even that reduced size required 1100 turns to be wound 
on a Ferroxcube core, so its construction required some degree of commitment. RV1 was a 
log-law component. This form of filter resurfaced in a transistor preamplifier design by Reg 
Williamson in 1967 [10]. In contrast, the well-known Leak Varislope preamplifiers used 
purely RC filtering, and only offered two switched slope settings.  
 Variable-slope scratch ﬁ lters: active solutions 
 The prospect of winding 1100 turns on a former to make an inductor is not at all appealing, 
and would turn anybody’s mind to RC active filters. This is quite apart from the well-known 
inductor drawbacks of weight, cost, non-linearity, and susceptibility to hum fields. In 1970 
John Linsley-Hood published an RC variable-slope filter design [11], but its operation 
was quite unacceptable, having irregularities in the passband down to 100 Hz, and 3 dB 
of internal peaking that eroded headroom. In 1990, Reg Williamson most ingeniously 
converted the LC filter to a more practical form by replacing the floating inductor with two 
gyrators [12]; the downside was that it required five opamp sections. 
 When I needed a varislope filter in 1978 I decided to have a go at designing my own version. 
The first attempt was adding a bypass resistance to a standard second-order Butterworth 
Figure 9.5: Variable-slope LC low-pass ﬁ lter response for varying bypass resistance

MM inputs: non-standard equalisation 283
Sallen and Key filter, as shown in  Figure 9.6 , with the response results in  Figure 9.7 , where 
the dashed bottom trace shows the pure second-order Butterworth characteristic obtained 
when the bypass resistance is entirely absent. The slopes are indeed varying smoothly, and are 
summarised in  Table 9.5 . Naturally the maximum slope is somewhat less than 12 dB/octave, 
since we started out with a second-order filter. The turnover frequency varies with the slope, 
though this is not necessarily a disadvantage. We are trying to make tolerable the reproduction 
from a very imperfect medium, not design a laboratory instrument. Here, increasing the bypass 
resistance gives ‘more filtering’ in two ways because the turnover frequency is reduced as the 
slope is increased.

Figure 9.7: Variable-slope active RC second-order low-pass ﬁ lter response for varying bypass 
resistance

284 Chapter 9
 In practice, adding a 1 kΩ end-stop resistor in series with the slope pot would probably be a 
good idea, as this will prevent C2 being connected directly to the output of the previous stage, 
which may object by going unstable. It is assumed there is a way of switching out the filter 
stage completely. 
 While the second-order low-pass filter with bypass resistance delivers variable slopes quite 
well, it is doubtful if a maximum slope of 12 dB/octave is really enough; the historical LC 
filter gave a maximum of almost 18 dB/octave. 
 I therefore took another swing at the problem by starting with a third-order Butterworth 
Sallen and Key filter, as in  Figure 9.8 . I have not converted the exact capacitor values to 
combinations of preferred values. Connecting a bypass resistance between the input and C3 
gives no useful result, but wiring it between C1 and C3 gives the response in  Figure 9.9 . 
There is something like a constant turnover frequency, but this does not align with the dashed 
line at 3 dB; rather it occurs around 7 dB. A variable-slope characteristic is obtained with 
slopes of between 5 and 15 dB/octave, as summarised in  Table 9.6 .

 There is now no need to add an end-stop resistor in series with the slope pot, as C3 is never 
connected directly to the input. I am not claiming that these bypass filters are the last word on 
the subject, but they are certainly more economical of parts than the Williamson gyrator filter. 
To the best of my knowledge this is the first time this technique has been published. 
    Variable-slope scratch ﬁ lters: the Hamill ﬁ lter 
 If slightly different design criteria are used, a different form of variable scratch filter 
results. In a 1981 article in  Wireless World , [13] David Hamill concluded that low-
pass filters with rapid roll-offs around the cutoff frequency introduced colouration, but 
this could be avoided if the area around cutoff had a slow roll-off to prevent ringing on 

286 Chapter 9
transients. The Gaussian filter characteristic is optimised for its time response, giving no 
overshoot and minimum rise and fall times on edges, but it gives a slow roll-off when near 
the cutoff frequency. Hamill stated that making the roll-off Gaussian for the first 10 dB or 
so is enough to prevent ringing, but as the filter cutoff frequency increases the roll-off can 
be made faster as the ear becomes less sensitive to colouration. His design therefore had a 
variable slope around the cutoff frequency, transitioning to a fixed 18 dB/octave ultimate 
slope at higher frequencies, unlike the filters described earlier which have variable ultimate 
slopes. 
 One slight problem with Gaussian filters is that they are impossible to construct. The slow 
roll-off that gives the good time response is obtained by cascading a series of first-order stages of 
differing and carefully chosen frequencies; the Gaussian roll-off slope steadily increases with 
frequency and is infinite at infinite frequency. You therefore need an infinite number of first-
order stages, which makes construction rather difficult. It is however entirely practical to build 
an  approximation to a Gaussian filter, by keeping the slow initial roll-off, but then smoothly 
splicing this to a constant, and therefore more practical, filter slope such as the 18 dB/octave 
of a third-order Butterworth or Bessel filter. All real ‘Gaussian’ filters are therefore actually 
transitional filters. 
 The original published design included a fixed-frequency third-order subsonic filter, but 
its presence or absence does not affect the operation of the scratch filter, and it is omitted 
here for clarity. The filter very cleverly has only one control to set cutoff frequency and 
slope around cutoff. As the control is turned the cutoff frequency increases, and at the same 
time the slope around the cutoff increase, the filter characteristic moving from a Bessel 
approximation to a Gaussian filter, through Butterworth, to a Chebyshev response with 0.5 dB 
passband ripple. This single ‘ripple’ is a very shallow peak around 15 kHz and is highly 
unlikely to be perceptible. The control is a single pot making stereo operation with a dual-
gang pot simple. I think we should call this a Hamill filter. 
 My interpretation of this filter is shown in  Figure 9.10 . The basic configuration is that of 
a two-stage third-order filter, but with capacitors C2 and C4 driven by a scaled version 
of the output voltage; the scaling factor is set by RV1, with R6 bending the control law 
so it approximates to logarithmic, i.e. linear in octaves. The circuit impedances have 
been reduced by a factor of 4.25 to improve the noise performance with modern opamps 
(the original design used discrete transistors), the precise factor being chosen to make 
the largest capacitor C3 exactly 20 nF, so it can be made from two 10 nF polystyrene 
capacitors C3A, C3B in parallel. This luckily gave a value of almost exactly 1.2 kΩ for R1, 
R2, and R3. The other capacitors C1, C2 and C4 inevitably have awkward values; they are 
made up assuming only E6 series components are available. As luck would have it, C1 and 
C4 come out very nicely, their combined nominal values being within 0.1% of the target, 
though three parallel capacitors C4A, C4B, and C4C are required to achieve this for C4. 
C2 is a bit less favourable, coming out 1% high, but this seems to have very little effect on 

MM inputs: non-standard equalisation 287
the responses, which as far as the eye can judge are identical to those published in  Wireless 
World . 
 The frequency responses for four control settings as the pot wiper is moved upwards are 
shown in  Figure 9.11 , and it can be seen that the Hamill filter does its work most effectively 
and ingeniously. It should prove useful for archival transcription work.

 Moving-magnet inputs:  discrete circuitry 
 Discrete MM input stages 
 Discrete moving-magnet (MM) input amplifiers were almost universal until the early 1970s. 
For a long time opamps had, quite deservedly, a poor reputation for noise when used in this 
application. When the first bipolar transistor MM inputs were designed, active components 
were still expensive, and adding another transistor to a circuit was not something to be 
done lightly. The circuitry from that era therefore looks to us very much cut-to-the-bone, 
and before disrespecting it we need to remember that it was designed under very different 
economic constraints. 
 A major problem with early discrete MM amplifiers was a simple lack of open-loop gain to give 
an accurate RIAA response network in the low frequency region, even if the RIAA network 
was accurate, which it rarely was. Another problem was that an RIAA feedback network, 
particularly one designed for low closed-loop gain, and/or a relatively low RIAA network 
impedance to reduce noise, presents a heavy load at high frequencies because the impedance 
of the capacitors becomes low. Heavy loading at HF was commonly a major cause of increased 
distortion and headroom-limitation in discrete RIAA stages that had either common-collector 
or emitter-follower output topologies with asymmetrical clipping behaviour; an NPN emitter-
follower is much better at sourcing current than sinking it. The 20 kHz output capability, and 
thus the overload margin, was often brought down by 6 dB or even more. Replacing the emitter 
resistor of an emitter-follower with a current-source gives a much better HF output current 
capability, and this can be further doubled for the same quiescent dissipation by using a simple 
push-pull Class-A output structure. 
 One-transistor MM input stages 
 I will say at once that the one-transistor MM input stage is purely a historical curiosity. Its 
performance cannot be expected to be anything other than dreadful by today’s standards. 
Nevertheless, the idea is worth looking at. Figure 10.1 shows a one-transistor MM input stage 
designed by Jack Dinsdale (of whom more later) in 1961 [1]. At that time transistors were 
 very expensive, and using two in a single stage would have been thought highly extravagant.  

290 Chapter 10
 If you have but one transistor to play with, there are only three possible configurations; 
common-collector, (i.e. emitter-follower) common-base, and common-emitter. The first 
gives no voltage gain, and the second has a low input impedance that looks unpromising. 
That leaves the common-emitter configuration, as in both halves of Figure 10.1. Since it 
inherently inverts, the only possibility is shunt-feedback, which, as we saw in  Chapter 8 , is 
inherently much noisier than its series-feedback equivalent. The standard approach at the 
time, derived from valve designs, was that in Figure 10.1a, which had an input resistor R1 
of 47 kΩ to give the correct cartridge loading, with the RIAA equalisation performed 
by the negative feedback network C1, R2, C2 in conjunction with the impedance of the 
collector load R3. 
 This arrangement is bound to give a poor noise performance. Dinsdale’s solution [1], in 
Figure 10.1b, was to make the input impedance low and implement the LF part of the 
RIAA equalisation by the interaction of the cartridge inductance with it, giving a 6 dB/
octave slope. As frequency falls the impedance of the inductance falls and the current into 
the input increases. He described this method as more ‘efficient’, which presumably means 
a greater transfer of energy through R1 and hence a better signal/noise ratio. Components 
R5 and C3 set the DC conditions, with base bias provided through R4. 
 The idea of loading the MM cartridge inductance with a low input resistance to achieve the 
LF boost section of the RIAA equalisation has come back to haunt us many times since then. 
The terrible snag is that since the LF equalisation is set by the cartridge inductance, changing 
the cartridge type almost certainly means you have to change the loading resistor too. You 
can, of course, add a control marked ‘cartridge inductance’, but this assumes you actually 
Figure 10.1: a) Basic one-transistor shunt-feedback MM ampliﬁ er, b) using the cartridge 
inductance to perform the LF part of the RIAA equalisation (Dinsdale 1961)

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 291
know the cartridge inductance, and know it precisely. Inaccuracy in the inductance setting 
will give errors in the RIAA response. You will have to rely on the manufacturer’s technical 
specification for the value of the inductance unless you plan to measure it yourself. 
 Two-transistor MM input stages 
 Figure 10.2 shows a typical two-transistor MM input amplifier from the late 60s. The 
configuration is generally considered to have been introduced by Jack Dinsdale in 1965, in a 
classic preamplifier design [2] that was one of the first to deal effectively with the new RIAA 
equalisation requirements for microgroove records. It is a two-stage series-feedback amplifier 
composed of two common-emitter stages. R3 and C1 make up an RF filter; note R3 is 3k3. 
This is considerably greater than the DC resistance of most MM cartridges and looks like 
it would introduce unnecessary Johnson noise and turn the current noise of Q1 into voltage 
noise. The RIAA network is R6, R7, C4, C5, and it has a high impedance to reduce loading 
on the stage output. Since R6 has the high value of 1M8, the RIAA network cannot be used 
for the DC feedback that is required to set the quiescent conditions. There is a separate DC 
feedback network comprising R1, R4, R5, R10, and C3 which establishes the appropriate 
voltage across R10. C3 keeps signal frequencies out of this path. The RIAA network is in 
Configuration-A (see  Chapter 8 ). No attempt is made to implement the IEC Amendment, as 
it was not introduced until 1976. 
Figure 10.2: A typical two-transistor MM ampliﬁ er as commonly used in the 1960’s and early 
70’s. Gain 39 dB at 1 kHz

292 Chapter 10
 Because of its simplicity, this stage inevitably contains compromises. The second collector 
resistor R11 needs to be high in value to maximise open-loop gain, but low to adequately 
drive the RIAA network and any external loading.  
 An MM preamp has to deliver a maximum low frequency boost of nearly 20 dB, on top of 
the gain required to get the desired output level at 1 kHz. If the cartridge output is taken as 
5 mVrms at 1 kHz, and the amplifier output is 150 mVrms (which is about as low as you 
could hope to get away with then if you were sending this signal to the outside world) then a 
total closed-loop gain of 20  34  54 dB is required at low frequencies. The open-loop gain 
obviously needs to be considerably higher than this, for a decent feedback factor is required 
not only to reduce distortion, but also to ensure that the RIAA equalisation is accurately 
rendered by the feedback network. By 1970 it had become clear that the two-transistor 
configuration was really not up to the job, and more sophisticated circuits using three 
transistors or more were developed, aided by falling semiconductor costs. While the two-
transistor MM preamplifier must now be regarded as of purely historical interest, it is highly 
instructive to see just what can be done with it by modification. 
 The circuit shown in  Figure 10.2 was deliberately chosen as representative of contemporary 
practice in its era, and it has not been modified or optimised in any way. It is closely based on 
a small RIAA preamplifier PCB called the ‘Lenco VV7’, which was intended for upgrading 
systems to use MM cartridges where the amplifier had only a ceramic pick-up input (see 
 Figure 10.3 ). It was a Swiss product distributed in Britain by Goldring in the early 1970’s. It 
had an integral mains PSU (see the tiny transformer on the left) with half-wave rectification 
and RC smoothing. What the proximity of that transformer did to the hum levels I do not 
know, but it looks awfully close to the preamp, which is in the screening can to the right. 
You will note that the single-rail supply is, by modern standards, low at 15 V; opamp-based 
preamplifiers today normally run from ±15 V or ±17 V, giving them a 6 dB headroom 
advantage at once. The gain is 39 dB at 1 kHz  
 I built up  Figure 10.2 with BC184 transistors, using an external DC supply. I found that the 
first-stage (Q1) collector current was 42 μA, and the second-stage (Q2) collector current was 
0.63 mA. On measuring it I was not exactly surprised that the performance was mediocre. 
There was a high level of hum at the output: 66 dBu at 50 Hz. Careful screening of the 
Figure 10.3: The Lenco phono preampliﬁ er

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 293
whole circuit only reduced this to 68 dBu, so electrostatic pickup was clearly not the only, 
or even the major, problem. 
 The RIAA equalisation accuracy, shown in  Figure 10.4 , is not good, which is only to be 
expected when you look at the standard component values in the RIAA network. Accurate 
RIAA networks cannot have more than one preferred value. The errors reach 2.3 dB 
at 20 Hz and 0.7 dB at 20 kHz; the IEC amendment is not implemented; it would have 
given an extra attenuation of 3 dB at 20 Hz and 1 dB at 40 Hz. The roll-off below 20 Hz 
is caused by C3. Increasing it from 47 μF to 100 μF much reduces the roll-off, and slightly 
improves RIAA accuracy between 20 and 200 Hz.  
 The preamplifier was being powered from a perfectly respectable bench PSU, but it still 
seemed possible that hum was getting in from the supply rail, as there is absolutely no 
filtering in the supply to Q1 collector. Inserting a 1 kΩ22 μF RC filter in the supply to 
R9 dropped the noise output from 68 to 73.4 dBu (this figure is the average of six 
readings, to reduce the tendency of a noise reading to jump about when there is significant 
low-frequency content. Measurement bandwidth is always 22 Hz22 kHz unless otherwise 
stated). A bandpass sweep of the noise output showed that there was now very little extra 
50 Hz or 100 Hz content. The RC filter gives an attenuation of 16.9 dB at 50 Hz and 
22.8 dB at 100 Hz. Increasing the filter capacitance to 100 μF however did give a slight 
improvement, so this was adopted; the attenuation at 50 Hz is now 29.9 dB. 
Figure 10.4: The RIAA errors are pretty gross by today’s standards. Things are improved somewhat 
by increasing C3 to 100 µF

294 Chapter 10
 Maximum output with a 15 V supply rail was 3.4 Vrms at 1 kHz (1% THD), and it is 
noticeable that clipping is not symmetrical, occurring first on the positive peaks. When this 
clipping does occur, there is a shift in the DC conditions of the circuit due to the way the 
biasing works through the filtering action of C3.  
 The THD at 1 Vrms out (1 kHz) was 0.010%, which by modern standards is a lot for such 
a low level.  Figure 10.5 shows the distortion performance with a 15 V rail, at 1, 2, and 
3 Vrms out. The input signal was inverse-RIAA equalised so that the output level remains 
constant with frequency. It was necessary to use the 100 Hz filter on the AP to get consistent 
results, despite having got rid of the 50 Hz problem with the RC filter, as there is still a large 
LF noise component due to the RIAA LF boost. 
 You can see that for 1 Vrms, the mid-band distortion is around 0.01%, but there is a steady 
rise below 1 kHz. This is caused by the falling negative feedback factor as the RIAA curve 
demands more gain at lower frequencies. The other area of concern is at high frequencies; at 
1 Vrms nothing too bad happens in the audio band, though THD has reached 0.02% at 20 kHz. 
 At the higher output level of 2 Vrms, the mid-band THD is tripled. The output stage starts 
to clip around 15 kHz, as Q2 can no longer drive the RIAA network, which has a falling

impedance at high frequencies. Things are pretty gross at 3 Vrms out, with THD around 
0.1% mid-band, and HF clipping starting at 4 kHz. 
 Clearly this historical RIAA preamp could use a bit of improvement, starting with linearity 
and headroom. Let's see what can be done with it; the process will reveal a lot about how 
discrete circuitry works. 
 Two-transistors: increasing supply voltage to 24 V 
 A pretty sure bet for improving both the linearity and headroom of a discrete amplifier is 
simply to increase the supply voltage. We will start by turning it up to 24 V, a voltage 
that can conveniently be obtained from a 7824 IC regulator.  Figure 10.6 shows the results: 
distortion is somewhat reduced overall and the HF overload problem has been pushed to 
slightly higher frequencies, but the effect is not as dramatic as we might have hoped. The 
maximum output has only increased to 3.8 Vrms at 1 kHz, (1% THD) which is not much 
of a return for increasing the supply voltage by 60%.  
 Casting a suspicious eye over the circuit, it's clear that it is still clipping asymmetrically. 
There is 18.4 V on Q2 collector, whereas for a symmetrical output swing we would 
expect something more like 12 V. Improving the bias conditions by changing R10 from

Bandwidth 100 Hz–80 kHz

296 Chapter 10
3k9 to 2k4 reduces Q2 collector volts to 15 V, and gives much more output voltage swing 
capability, as well as increasing the standing current in Q2, which improves load-driving 
capability. The maximum output is now 6.0 Vrms at 1 kHz, an improvement of 4 dB. 
While this does not give exact symmetry of clipping, it does seem to be close to optimal 
biasing for linearity. A good indication of this is that the distortion residual at 1 kHz is 
third-harmonic, which suggests that some cancellation of second-harmonic distortion is 
going on. 
 The distortion performance is transformed 3 Vrms out (1 kHz) gave 0.06% in  Figure 10.6 . 
After re-biasing it has fallen to 0.014%, as in  Figure 10.7 . The HF overload effect has also 
been pushed out to above 20 kHz, even for the 3 Vrms case. Not bad for modifications that 
essentially cost nothing. 
 The distortion improvement at lower output voltages in the mid-band is barely visible even 
with 100 Hz AP filtering because of the high noise output from a circuit with 39 dB of gain 
at 1 kHz.  
 The modified circuit, with the added RC filter for the first stage, supply increased to 24 V, 
and biasing adjusted by changing R10, is shown in  Figure 10.8 . The I c of Q1 is now 75 μA, 
and the I c of Q2 is 1.1 mA.

rebiasing. Bandwidth 100 Hz–80 kHz

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 297
 Two-transistors: increasing supply voltage to 30 V 
 Since increasing the supply to 24 V gave considerable benefits (after re-biasing), we will increase 
it further to 30 V. This increases the maximum output to 6.8 Vrms at 1 kHz (1% THD), which 
is 6 dB up on the original circuit. R10 has been changed again to 2k2 to optimise the biasing. The 
results are seen in  Figure 10.9 . The THD for the 1 Vrms case is now completely submerged in low-
frequency noise, so I used the 400 Hz AP filter, which shows the THD at 1 Vrms (1 kHz) is about 
0.0055%. This number however still contains a significant amount of noise.  
 HF overload behaviour has improved again, but HF distortion is somewhat worse, at all three 
output levels. The LF distortion is notably improved, being more than halved. 
 As a side issue, we might consider how to generate the supply rail required. The 7824 IC 
regulator will accept a maximum input of 40 V, so it is feasible to use that with the ADJ pin 
elevated by some means, as described in  Chapter 25 . For voltages above 30 V this does 
not leave enough regulator headroom, and we might need to use the TL783 high-voltage 
regulator. This is a favourite device for generating 48 V supplies for microphone phantom 
power, and can definitely be relied on up to this voltage. 
 Two-transistors: gain distribution 
 At this point I began wondering what else could be done to reduce the distortion. There 
are practical limits to raising the supply voltage: power dissipation increases and there is 
Figure 10.8: The two-transistor MM ampliﬁ er using a 24 V rail, with the RC ﬁ lter R6, C12 
added to the collector of Q1, and after rebiasing by altering R10

298 Chapter 10
a danger that the circuit could generate turn-on or turn-off transients that would damage 
stages downstream. 
 At this point it’s worth considering what the sources of non-linearity are. The two 
transistors, obviously, but the RIAA capacitors could also be contributing, as I used 
ordinary polyester types, and if you’ve read the chapter on components, you will know 
that these are not wholly linear, and in this application there is a significant signal 
voltage across them. However the distortion generated by polyester caps is typically of 
the order of 0.001% at 10 Vrms, and the signal levels we are using here are much lower 
than that, so the capacitor contribution is almost certainly negligible. At the time of 
writing I haven’t got round to proving the point by substituting polypropylene capacitors, 
which  are linear. 
 The configuration is made up of two cascaded voltage amplifiers, and it seemed to be a good 
idea to find out how the open-loop gain is distributed between them. The high value of the 
Q1 collector load suggests that it is intended to give a high voltage gain. 
 Measurement showed that the signal on Q1 collector was 49 dB with reference to that 
on the output at Q2 collector, at 1 kHz. This was confirmed by SPICE simulation, which 
gave 45 dB on Q1 collector between 100 Hz and 10 kHz. Note however that the emitter

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 299
of Q2 is connected to AC ground via C3, which suggests that the second stage has a 
low input impedance and perhaps the first stage is working as a transconductance stage, 
feeding a current into the base of Q1 rather than a voltage, if you see what I mean. SPICE 
gives the error voltage, i.e. that between the base and emitter of Q1, as 38 dB below the 
output voltage, so the voltage on Q1 collector is less than that going into the first stage, 
and this indicates that Q1 is indeed feeding a current to Q2. This is an important finding 
as it means that the open-loop gain, and hence the feedback factor, cannot be increased by 
bootstrapping the collector load of Q1, which was the idea I had at the back of my mind 
all along. 
 The low-impedance at Q2 base will be further reduced by Miller feedback through the Cbc 
of Q2, though how significant that is uncertain at present. Since Cbc is a function of collector 
voltage this is another potential source of non-linearity. 
 Two-transistors: dual supply rails 
 The question arises as to how easy it would be to convert this stage to run off dual supply 
rails, i.e. ±V and 0 V. The answer appears to be not easy at all, because the input transistor Q1 
that performs the input-NFB subtraction is sitting very near the bottom rail. 
 Two-transistors: the historical Dinsdale MM circuit 
 The first two-transistor MM stage is generally accepted to have been put forward by 
J. Dinsdale, in an article ‘Transistor High-Quality Audio Amplifier’, in  Wireless World for 
January 1965. This article may be 45 years old but it is still worth reading if you can get hold 
of it, not least because it discusses how to make an MM preamplifier using just  one transistor 
(see the start of this chapter).  
 You will note at once from  Figure 10.10 that the circuit is upside-down to modern eyes, with 
a negative supply rail at the top. This was common in circuits of the era, and stemmed from 
the fact that most germanium transistors were PNP, so if you drew the emitter at the bottom 
(which is where people were used to drawing valve cathodes) then inevitably you end up with 
a negative supply rail at the top. When silicon transistors came in, they were more commonly 
NPN, so a sigh of relief went up all round as we reverted to the more logical approach of 
having the most positive rail at the top. 
 I have not so far tried building this circuit, due to the difficulty of obtaining the transistors. 
The OC44 was a PNP germanium transistor made by Mullard. Remarkably, it is still in much 
demand as it is held to give a unique sound in vintage-style fuzz boxes [3]. 
 Comparing this circuit with  Figure 10.2 you can see that there are the characteristic two 
separate feedback loops, with DC feedback through R13, R14 and R7, and AC feedback to 
Q1 emitter via the RIAA network R15, C8, R16 and C7. The DC path through this network 

300 Chapter 10
is blocked by C3. The RIAA network is in Configuration-B (see  Chapter 8 ). There is no IEC 
Amendment. 
 C3 bootstraps R6 to raise the input impedance high enough to give 47 kΩ in conjunction with 
loading resistor R2; disconcertingly Dinsdale refers to this as ‘feedback’ in his article, which 
it is not. 
 The supply rail voltage is not precisely known, as in the complete preamplifier circuit the 
MM stage is fed through a network of RC filters that leave the final voltage in some doubt. 
It clearly is not greater than 20 V, judging by the rating of C13, and it seems pretty safe to 
assume it was around 15 V. However the OC44 had a collector breakdown voltage of only 
15 V, so the rail might have been lower – perhaps 12 V. 
 This circuit uses more parts than the two-transistor circuit of  Figure 10.2 , largely as a result 
of the different DC bias arrangements. Apart from the transistors, it has 12 resistors and 
five electrolytic capacitors.  Figure 10.2 has (ignoring EMC filtering) 10 resistors and 
two electrolytic capacitors, and is the more economical solution. 
Figure 10.10: The circuit of the original Dinsdale MM stage: 1965

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 301
 Three-transistor MM input stages 
 Adding an extra transistor improves the possible performance remarkably. The most 
common three-transistor configuration was introduced by Arthur Bailey in 1966 [4], though 
his version had a rather awkward level-shift between the first and second transistors. 
 Figure 10.11 shows a much improved version from the early 70s, designed by H. P. Walker 
[5], and later enhanced by my own good self [6]. It consists of two voltage-amplifier 
stages as before, but an emitter-follower Q3 is added to buffer the collector of the second 
transistor from the load of the RIAA network and any external load. This means that the 
second transistor collector can be operated at a much higher impedance, generating more 
open-loop gain. 
 The original Walker design had a simple 22 kΩ resistor as a collector load for Q2; when I was 
using this configuration in [6] I split this into two 12 kΩ resistors, bootstrapping their central 
point from the emitter of Q3 as shown in  Figure 10.11 ; this further increased the open-loop 
gain and reduced the stage distortion by a factor of three. Dominant-pole compensation is 
applied to Q2 by C1. Once again, the RIAA network has a high impedance and a separate 
path for DC feedback must be provided by R1; there is in fact no DC feedback at all through 
the RIAA network as it is connected to the outside of C9. R3 and C8 are the input RF filter. 
The supply to the first stage is heavily filtered by R8 and C5.

70s. The original design was by H. P. Walker, the bootstrapping of Q2 collector was added by me

302 Chapter 10
 The RIAA network is in Configuration-A. There is no IEC Amendment, as it was not 
introduced until 1976.  
 The added emitter follower Q3, running at a much higher collector current than Q2 (5 mA 
versus 500 μA) much increases the output voltage swing into a load and so improves the 
input overload margin. However, a simple emitter follower output stage has an asymmetrical 
output current capability, and so this is less effective at high frequencies where the impedance 
of the RIAA network is falling. Low-gain versions of this circuit may have the overload 
margin compromised by several dB at 20 kHz. This can be overcome by making the output 
stage more sophisticated – replacing the emitter resistor R4 with a current-source greatly 
improves matters, and using a push-pull Class-A output doubles the output current capability 
again (see  Chapter 3 on discrete design for more details). 
 While this stage is a great improvement on the two-transistor configuration, it also is not well-
adapted to dual supply rails, for the same reason; Q1 is still referenced to the bottom rail. 
 Figure 10.12 demonstrates another way to use three transistors in an RIAA amplifier; this 
configuration consists of a voltage amplifier stage, an emitter-follower, and then another 
Figure 10.12: Another three-transistor MM ampliﬁ er conﬁ guration with a quite different structure. 
This is a simpliﬁ ed version of a circuit used by Pioneer and Sonab

voltage amplifier stage. The RIAA network is in Configuration-A. The first transistor is now 
a PNP type, its collector bootstrapped for increased gain by connecting the lower end of 
collector load R6 to the emitter-follower Q2. R2 and C8 make up an RF filter, and once more 
there is a high value of series resistance. Q2 drives the output transistor Q3, which is now 
a common-emitter voltage amplifier with collector load R8. Note the asymmetrical supply 
voltages; the positive rail is 8 V greater than the negative rail, and this is almost certainly 
intended to increase the positive-swing capabilities of the Q3 stage. Once again note the high 
impedances in the RIAA network to reduce the loading on the output, and the consequent 
need for a separate DC feedback path via R10, the AC content being filtered out by C7. 
Versions of this configuration were used by Pioneer and Sonab.  
 Four-transistor MM input stages 
 All of the amplifiers described so far have conventional output stages and so have trouble 
driving their RIAA network at high frequencies. Going from three transistors to four gives 
much greater freedom of design, and allows us to use a markedly more capable output stage. 
The design in  Figure 10.13 is closely based on the MM input stage of my High-Performance 
Figure 10.13: Four-transistor MM ampliﬁ er conﬁ guration with push-pull Class-A structure. Based 
on the MM stage of my ‘High-Performance Preampliﬁ er’ published in Wireless World in 1979

304 Chapter 10
Preamplifier published in  Wireless World in 1979 [7]. By my own internal labelling system 
this was the MRP4. A slightly modified version (the MRP6) was used a year later in a 
preamplifier design for a consultancy client. 
 The MRP4 was the first ‘conventional’ preamplifier design – insofar as my designs are ever 
conventional – that I published. It was my own reaction to the considerable complexity of 
the Advanced Preamplifier of 1976 [6], with its multiple discrete op-amps. Back then the 
available IC opamps were looked at with entirely justified suspicion; they were relatively 
noisy and prone to crossover distortion in their output stages. Crossover might be inescapable 
in a power amplifier, but it was definitely not wanted in a preamplifier. Thus discrete Class-A 
circuitry was used throughout the preamplifier (the 5534 opamp was just becoming available 
at the time, but was horribly expensive). 
 This design was intended to display a very large overload margin, and so its gain at 1 kHz 
was only 10 times (20 dB) and the output was only 50 mVrms nominal. Obviously, further 
downstream amplification (of variable gain) was required to get the signal up to a level that 
could be applied to a power amplifier. The configuration is much the same as many power 
amplifiers of the day, and if the singleton input transistor was replaced by a differential pair, 
it would look very much like the ‘model amplifiers’ used so extensively in my book  Audio 
Power Amplifier Design  [8]. I used a single-transistor input because I was worried about the 
noise contribution from the second transistor in a differential pair. That this might create a 
relatively large amount of second-harmonic distortion was considered of less importance, 
given the 50 mVrms nominal output of the stage. The RIAA network is an example of 
Configuration-C, which is preferred because of its lower capacitor values for the same gain 
and impedance (as described in  Chapter 8 ). It has capacitor values similar to those used in 
the 30 dB gain opamp MM inputs in that chapter, but R0 (which in this case is actually 
labelled R11) is larger so the gain is 10 dB less. The stage could accept an input of 1.1 Vrms 
at 1 kHz, an overload margin of no less than 47 dB, and 3.8 Vrms at 10 kHz. The low gain 
made an HF correction pole (R7, C3) essential. No attempt was made to implement the IEC 
Amendment. 
 The whole preamplifier ran off a single 38 V rail that was not regulated; instead it had a 
post-reservoir RC filter that reduced the supply ripple to about 50 mVrms. This low-cost 
approach was combined with heavy RC decoupling of the bias network for each stage, and 
this was very effective at getting low hum figures. 
 The biasing network R14, R15, R16, D1, D2 provides three voltages. The 20 V ‘V/2’ bias 
rail was used throughout the rest of the preamplifier; it is heavily filtered by the large value of 
C9. The bias voltage at the top of R16 was lower to allow for the voltage drop of Q1 collector 
current through R5. This voltage-shift is an inherent problem with singleton inputs. D1, D2 
provide the bias for the push-pull output stage, and were shared between the left and right 
inputs without any crosstalk problems. 

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 305
 The input impedance is defined by resistors R10 R1, in parallel with DC drain R3; this 
comes to 46.8 kΩ. You will note that all the resistors in the stage (including those in the 
RIAA network) are E12, because E24 value resistors were specialised and expensive parts 
back in those days, and rarely if ever used in audio work.  
 The collector current of Q1 is set by the V be of Q2 maintained across R2, and is here 53 μA. 
The signal is passed as a current from Q1 to the VAS Q2, on whose collector the full output 
swing is developed. Q2 collector load was a bootstrapped resistor rather than a current source 
as this still gave an economic advantage at the time. This is then buffered by the push-pull 
emitter-follower Q4 with its driven current source Q3. The operation of the push-pull output 
structure is fully described in  Chapter 3 on discrete design.  
 Stability is an issue here because the amplifier is working with a closed-loop gain close 
to unity at HF. The Miller dominant-pole capacitor, C6, is made as small as possible to 
maximise the slew rate, and stability is assisted by the lead-lag network R17, C10 across Q1 
collector resistor. This stage was followed by a third-order subsonic filter using a current-
source emitter-follower, and the only THD figure I have to hand is for both stages together. 
THD was below 0.004% at 6 Vrms out, from 1 kHz to 10 kHz, the input signal being 
inverse-RIAA equalised to give constant output with frequency. 
 This design could be relatively easily converted to run off dual supply rails, as the first transistor 
is not referenced to the bottom rail. However, the voltage drop through R5 is a problem, for if Q1 
is biased from 0 V, the output standing voltage will be several volts positive. 
 More complex discrete-transistor MM input stages 
 The record for the highest supply voltage to an RIAA stage was set in 1974 by the Technics 
SU9600, which employed ±24 V rails and a third rail at a staggering 136 V. This gives a 
whole new meaning to the phrase ‘third-rail electrification’. To the best of my knowledge the 
record still stands. The general configuration is shown in  Figure 10.14 ; seven transistors are 
used, in three cascaded differential voltage amplifiers, followed by an emitter-follower output 
buffer. The final voltage amplifier and the output stage work on asymmetrical supplies, running 
between 136 V and 24 V. The output sits at 56 V to allow a symmetrical output swing, 
which accounts for the DC blocking capacitor C11. Note that several resistors around the output 
stage are high-wattage types. RV1 allowed gain adjustment, while RV2 and RV3 were for 
setting the DC conditions. My information is that the maximum input was 900 mV (frequency 
unstated, but presumably at 1 kHz), the THD was 0.08% (frequency and level unstated), the S/N 
ratio was 73 dB with reference to 2 mV, and the RIAA accuracy was ± 0.3 dB.  
 The output device dissipation is of course enormous for a preamp stage, and the use of a 
constant-current source, or better still a push-pull Class-A output stage, would have allowed 

Figure 10.14: A simpliﬁ ed schematic of the Technics SU9600 RIAA stage, with its 136 V supply rail

MM inputs: discrete circuitry 307
this to be much reduced; one can only speculate as to why those techniques were not used. 
There would have been some fearsome transients at the output on switch-on, and it is notable 
that an output muting relay was required, probably not so much for reducing audible noise as 
to give the later stages in the preamplifier a chance of survival. 
 In the original circuit small capacitors were freely sprinkled over the diagram, leading me to 
suspect that HF stability was a serious issue during development.

 Moving-magnet inputs : 
 noise and distortion 
 Noise in MM RIAA preampliﬁ ers 
 The subject of noise in moving-magnet (MM) RIAA preamplifiers is an involved business. 
An MM cartridge is a combination of resistance and a significant amount of inductance, with 
neither parameter having standard values, and this is combined with the complications of 
RIAA equalisation [1]. Burkhard Vogel has written a monumental 740-page book solely on 
RIAA amp noise [2], but even this does not exhaust the subject. 
 The first priority is to find out the physical limits that set how low the noise can be. The 
best possible equivalent input noise (EIN) for a purely resistive source, such as a 200 Ω 
microphone, is easily calculated to be 129.6 dBu with a noiseless amplifier at the usual 
temperature and bandwidth, but the same calculation for a moving-magnet input is much 
harder. Real amplifiers have their own noise, and the amount by which the source-amplifier 
combination is noisier than the source alone is the noise figure (NF) and we want to get this 
as low as possible. Noise figures are rarely, if ever, used in audio specifications, probably 
because they are very revealing; an NF of 20 dB usually indicates that someone doesn’t know 
what they’re about. Manufacturers seem to have no interest at all in quoting MM noise specs 
in a way that would allow easy comparison. 
 Most of the complications in calculating theoretical noise occur only when an MM cartridge 
is driving an RIAA preamp directly. When an MC cartridge is in use, the RIAA stage will be 
driven from an MC headamp, the output impedance of which should be very low, and this 
makes the noise situation much simpler (see later in this chapter). 
 The electronic noise will be much lower than the noise generated by the stylus sliding along 
a groove; hard data on this is in short supply but it is likely that the groove noise (sometimes 
called surface noise) will be 20 dB or more above the electronic noise [3]. Groove noise 
increases as the record wears with playing. 
 This presents a philosophical conundrum: is it not a waste of time to strive for low electronic 
noise when the groove noise is much greater and, since they will sum with rms-addition, 
the contribution of the electronic noise is negligible? If obtaining a good electronic noise 

310 Chapter 11
performance was difficult and expensive this argument would have more force, but it is simply 
not so. This chapter will show how to get within a couple of dB of the lowest noise physically 
possible using cheap opamps and a little ingenuity. We will therefore do that, and sit back and see 
if record enthusiasts can improve their vinyl formulations to match. I think it will be a long wait. 
 A-weighting is not used in this chapter (or any other) except where explicitly stated. 
 Cartridge impedances 
 The impedance of the cartridge strongly influences the noise performance of an MM RIAA 
stage. Manufacturers do not always supply this data, and so I have had to make the best of 
what is available. Some of the cartridges listed in  Table 11.1 are vintage while some are

up-to-date, the collection covering from about 1972 to 2013. Resistance ranges from 430 Ω 
to 1500 Ω, and inductance generally from 330 to 720 mH, apart from the Grado series which 
are more moving-iron than MM in operation, but given their 5 mV per cm/s output they are 
going to be used with an MM input. Moving-iron pickups go back a long way; see an article 
by Francis in  Wireless World for 1947 [4], where a 1:100 step-up transformer was used to get 
the signal up to a suitable level to apply to a valve preamplifier. The Shure V15V values have 
been confirmed by Burkhard Vogel [5]. 
Figure 11.1: MM cartridge inductance, including DJ cartridges
 The inductance of the cartridge is an important element in determining the noise 
performance, as will shortly be made clear.  Figure 11.1 shows the inductance of 
51 cartridges, covering both historical and contemporary models. The six types in the 
‘0300 mH’ column are the Grado series. The seven types in the rightmost two columns are 
DJ types with higher output and inductance than normal hifi cartridges (see  Chapter 8 ). 
 Noise modelling of RIAA preampliﬁ ers 
 The basic noise situation for a series-feedback RIAA stage using an opamp is shown in 
 Figure 11.2 . The cartridge is modelled as a resistance R gen in series with a significant 
inductance L gen , and is loaded by the standard 47 kΩ resistor R in ; this innocent-looking

component causes more mischief than you might think. The amplifier A1 is treated as 
noiseless, its voltage noise being represented by the voltage generator V noise , and the 
current noise of each input being represented by the current generators I noise  and I noise , 
which are uncorrelated. It does not matter to which side of V noise I noise  is connected 
because V noise has no internal resistance. 
 The contributions to the noise at the input of A1 are: 
1.  The Johnson noise of the cartridge resistance R gen . This sets the ultimate limit to the 
signal/noise ratio. The proportion of noise from Rgen that reaches the amplifier input 
falls with frequency as the impedance of L gen increases. Here the fraction reaching the 
amplifier falls from 0.99 to 0.48 from 36 Hz to 17.4 kHz. A complication that is not 
visible in the diagram is that the effective value of R gen is not simply the resistance of the 
coils. It increases in value with frequency (while still remaining resistive  we are not 
talking about inductance here) as a consequence of hysteresis and eddy current magnetic 
losses in the iron on which the coils are wound, and possibly skin effect [6]. These losses 
are sometimes modelled by a frequency-dependent resistance placed across L gen , as by 
Hallgren [7], or by a fixed resistance across part of a tapped L gen [8]. According to Gevel 
[9] the losses have little effect on noise issues, and they are not modelled here, not least 
because of a sad lack of data. 
2.  The Johnson noise of the 47 kΩ input load R in . Some of the Johnson noise generated by 
R in is shunted away from the amplifier input by the cartridge, the amount decreasing with 
frequency due to the inductance L gen . Here the fraction reaching the amplifier rises from 
0.013 to 0.52 from 36 Hz to 17.4 kHz. 
3.  The opamp voltage noise V noise . This contribution is unaffected by other components.

parameter values (Shure ME75-ED2)

MM inputs: noise and distortion 313
4.  The noise voltage generated by I noise  flowing through the parallel combination of the 
cartridge impedance and R in . This impedance increases with frequency due to L gen . Here 
it increases from 619 Ω at 36 Hz to 24.5 kΩ at 17.4 kHz; the increase at the top end is 
moderated by the shunting effect of R in . This increase has a major effect on the noise 
behaviour. For the lowest noise you must design for a higher impedance than you might 
think, and Gevel [9] quotes 12 kΩ as a suitable value for noise optimisation; this assumes 
A-weighting, inclusion of the IEC amendment, and cartridge parameters of 1000 Ω and 
494 mH. 
5.  The Johnson noise of R0. For the values shown, and with A1 assumed to be 5534A, 
ignoring the Johnson noise of R0 improves the noise performance by only 0.35 dB. The 
other resistors in the RIAA feedback network are ignored, as R0 has a much lower value, 
but the RIAA frequency response must of course be modelled. 
6.  The noise voltage generated by Inoise- flowing through R0. For normal values of R0, say up to 
1000 Ω, this contribution is negligible, affecting the total noise output by less than 0.01 dB. 
 Contributions 1, 2 and 4 are significantly affected by the rising impedance of the cartridge 
inductance L gen with frequency. On top of this complicated frequency-dependent behaviour 
is overlaid the effect of the RIAA equalisation. This would reduce the level of white noise 
by 4.2 dB, but we are not dealing with white noise  the HF part of the spectrum has been 
accentuated by the effects of L gen , and with the cartridge parameters given RIAA equalisation 
actually reduces the noise amplitude by 10.4 dB. 
 Clearly this model has some quite complex behaviour. It could be analysed mathematically, 
using a package such as MathCAD, or it could be simulated by SPICE. The solution I chose 
is a spreadsheet mathematical model of the cartridge input. The basic method is described 
by Sherwin [10]. The audio spectrum is divided into a number of octave bands so RIAA 
equalisation factors can be applied, and V noise , I noise and R gen can be varied with frequency if 
desired. I extended the Sherwin scheme by using ten octave bands covering 22 Hz to 22 kHz; 
ten bands are enough to make the process accurate. An advantage of the spreadsheet method 
is that it is very simple to turn off various noise contributions so you can experiment with 
noiseless amplifiers or other flights from physical reality. For example, the noise generated by 
the 47 kΩ resistor R in is modelled separately from its loading effects so they can be switched 
off independently (see load synthesis later in this chapter). It is also possible to switch off the 
bottom four octave bands to make the results comparable with real cartridge measurements 
that require a steep 400 Hz high-pass filter to remove the hum. A-weighting can also be 
switched on and off. The RIAA IEC Amendment can be switched on and off too, but since 
it only has an effect on very low frequencies the effect on the noise is negligible. The results 
match well with my 5534, 5532 and TL072 measurements, and experience shows the model 
is a usable tool. While it is no substitute for careful measurements, it gives a good physical 
insight and allows noise comparisons at the LF end where hum is very difficult to exclude 

314 Chapter 11
completely. I call this model MAGNOISE2; it is an enhancement of the earlier MAGNOISE 
with improved accuracy. For this reason there are some small differences between the figures 
quoted here and in the first edition of this book, but the principles and the conclusions drawn 
remain the same. 
 Table 11.2 shows some interesting cases: output noise, EIN, and signal-to-noise ratio for a 
5 mVrms input at 1 kHz are calculated for gain of 30.0 dB at 1 kHz. The IEC Amendment 
is included. The cartridge parameters were set to 610 Ω  470 mH, the measured values for 
the Shure M75ED 2. Bandwidth is 22 Hz22 kHz, no A-weighting is used, and 1/ f noise was 
not considered. Be aware that the 5534A is a low-noise version of the 5534, with a typical

MM inputs: noise and distortion 315
voltage noise density of 3.5 rather than 4 nV√ Hz, and a typical current noise density of 0.4 
rather than 0.6 pA/√ Hz. There is also an A-version of the 5532, but curiously the data sheets 
show no noise advantage. The voltage noise and current noise densities used here are the 
manufacturer’s ‘typical’ figures. I am not aware of any data on how much they vary around 
the quoted values in practice. 
 Firstly let us see how quiet the circuit of  Figure 11.2 would be if we had miraculously noise-free 
electronics. 
 Case 0: We will begin with a completely theoretical situation with no amplifier noise, 
and an MM cartridge with no resistance R gen . L gen is 470 mH. R in is set to 1000 MΩ; the 
significance of that will be seen shortly. The noise out is a subterranean and completely 
unrealistic 136.8 dBu, and that is  after 30 dB of amplification. This noise comes 
wholly from R in , and can be reduced without limit if R in is increased without limit. Thus if 
R in is set to 1000 GΩ the noise out is 166.8 dBu. 
 You may ask why the noise is going up as the resistance goes down, whereas it is usually the 
other way around. This is because of the high cartridge inductance, which means the Johnson 
noise of R in acts as a current rather than a voltage, and this goes up as resistance goes down. 
 Case 1: We now switch on the Johnson noise from R gen (610 Ω). We will continue to 
completely ignore the cartridge loading requirements and leave R in at 1000 MΩ, at which 
value it now has no effect on noise. The output noise with these particular cartridge parameters 
is then 98.8 dBu (Case 1a). This is the quietest possible condition, (if you can come up with 
a noiseless amplifier) but you will note that right from the start the signal/noise ratio of 85 dB 
compares badly with the 96 dB of a CD, a situation that merits some thought. And there is, of 
course, no groove noise on CDs. All of this noise comes from R gen , the resistive component of 
the cartridge impedance. The only way to improve on this would be to select a cartridge with a 
lower R gen but the same sensitivity, or start pumping liquid nitrogen down the tone-arm (as an 
aside, if you  did  cool your cartridge with liquid nitrogen at 196 °C, the Johnson noise from 
R gen  would only be reduced by 5.8 dB, and if you are using a 5534A in the preamplifier, as in 
Case 6a below, the overall improvement would only be 0.75 dB. And, of course, the compliant 
materials would go solid and the cartridge wouldn’t work at all. Hold the cryostats!). 
 With lower, but still high, values of R in the noise increases; with R in set to 10 MΩ (Case 1b) 
the EIN is 128.7 dBu, a bare 0.1 dB worse. With R in set to 1 MΩ (Case 1c) the EIN is now 
128.2 dBu, 0.8 dB worse than the best possible condition (Case 1a). 
 Case 2: It is however a fact of life that MM cartridges need to be properly loaded, and when 
we set R in to its correct value of 47 kΩ things deteriorate sharply, the EIN rising by 3.2 dB 
(compared with Case 1a) to 125.6 dBu. That 47 kΩ resistor is not innocent at all. This 
case still assumes a noiseless amplifier, and appears to be the appropriate noise reference for 
design, so the noise figure is 0 dB (however, see the section on load synthesis later in this 

316 Chapter 11
chapter, which shows how the effects of noise from R in can be reduced by some non-obvious 
methods). Cases 1a,b and c, therefore, have negative noise figures but this has little meaning. 
 Case 3: We leave the amplifier noise switched off, but add in the Johnson noise from R0 
and the effect of I noise to see if the value of 220 Ω is appropriate. The noise only worsens by 
0.7 dB, so it looks like R0 is not the first thing to worry about. Its contribution is included in 
all the cases that follow. The noise figure is now 0.7 dB. 
 We will now take a deep breath and switch on the amplifier noise. 
 Case 4: Here we use a single J310 FET, a device often recommended for this application 
[9]. With I d set to 10 mA, the voltage noise is about 2 nV√ Hz; the current noise is 
negligible, which is why it is overall slightly quieter than the 2SB737 despite having more 
voltage noise. 
 Case 5: In these cases a single discrete bipolar transistor is used as an input device, not a 
differential pair. This can give superior noise results to an opamp. The transistor may be part 
of a fully discrete RIAA stage, or the front end to an opamp. If we turn a blind eye to supply 
difficulties and use the remarkable 2SB737 transistor (with R b only 2 Ω typical) then some 
interesting results are possible. We can decide the collector current of the device, so we can 
to some extent trade off voltage noise against current noise, as described in  Chapter 1 . We 
know that current noise is important with an MM input, and so we will start off with quite a 
low I c of 200 μA, which gives Case 5c in  Table 11.2 . The result is very slightly worse than 
the 5534A (Case 6a). Undiscouraged, we drop I c to 100 μA (Case 5b) and voltage noise 
increases but current noise decreases, the net result being that things are now 0.9 dB quieter 
than the 5534A. If we reduce I c  again to 70 μA (Case 5a) we gain another 0.2 dB, and we 
have an EIN of 123.6 and a noise figure of only 2.0 dB. Voltage noise is now increasing 
fast and there is virtually nothing to be gained by reducing the collector current further. 
 We therefore must conclude that even an exceptionally good single discrete BJT with 
appropriate support circuitry will only gain us a 1.1 dB noise advantage over the 5534A, while 
the J310 FET gives only a 1.7 dB advantage, and it is questionable if the extra complication is 
worth it. You are probably wondering why going from a single transistor to an opamp does not 
introduce a 3 dB noise penalty because the opamp has a differential input with two transistors. 
The answer is that the second opamp transistor is connected to the NFB network and sees much 
more favourable noise conditions; a low and resistive source impedance in the shape of R0. 
 Case 6: Here we have a 5534A as the amplifying element, and using the typical 1 kHz 
specs for the A-suffix part, we get an EIN of 122.5 dBu and an NF of 3.1 dB (Case 
6a with R0  220 Ω). Using thoroughly standard technology, and one of the cheapest 
opamps about, we are within three decibels of perfection; the only downside is that the 
opportunities for showing off some virtuoso circuit design with discrete transistors appear 
limited. Case 6a is useful as a standard for comparison with other cases, as in the rightmost 
column of  Table 11.2 . 

MM inputs: noise and distortion 317
 Firstly, how does the value of R0 affect noise? In Case 6b, R0 is increased to 470 Ω, and the 
noise is only 0.4 dB worse; if you can live with that, the increase in the impedance of the RIAA 
feedback network allows significant savings in expensive precision capacitors. In Case 6c, R0 
is raised further to 1000 Ω, and noise is now 1.1 dB worse than the 220 Ω case. Reducing R0 
from 220 Ω to 100 Ω is do-able at some cost in capacitors, but only reduces the noise output by 
0.2 dBu. In  Chapter 8 , the value of R0 can be manipulated to get convenient capacitor values 
in the RIAA network, because it has only a weak effect on the noise performance. 
 Secondly, we have seen that the presence of L gen has a big effect on the noise contributions. 
In Case 6a, if we reduce L gen to zero the noise out drops from 92.5 to 94.7 dBu. Halving 
it gives 93.8 dBu. Minimum cartridge inductance is a good thing. 
 Thirdly, what about R gen ? With the original value of L gen , setting R gen to zero only reduces the 
noise from 92.5 to 93.5 dBu; the cartridge inductance has more effect than its resistance. 
 Case 7: It is well-known that the single 5534A has somewhat better noise specs than the dual 
5532A, with both e n and i n being significantly lower, but does this translate into a significant 
noise advantage in the RIAA application? Case 7 shows that on plugging in a 5532A the 
noise output increases by 2.0 dB, the EIN increasing to 120.5 dBu. The NF is now 5.1 dB, 
which looks a bit less satisfactory. If you want good performance then the inconvenience of 
a single package and an external compensation capacitor are well worth putting up with. If 
your circuit design ends up with an odd number of half-5532s per channel, a 5534A can be 
placed in the MM stage, where its lower noise is best used. 
 Case 8: Ho-hum, I hear you murmur, it all comes back to the 5534A, doesn’t it? What about 
all the other opamps on the market? In Case 8 we take the FET-input OPA2134, which is a 
good opamp when DC accuracy and low bias currents are required; we find the e n is much 
higher at 8 nV√ Hz, but i n is very low indeed at 3 fA√ Hz. It looks like we might be in with 
a chance, but the greater voltage noise does more harm than the lower current noise does 
good and the EIN goes up to 119.3 dBu. The OPA2134 is therefore 3.2 dB noisier than the 
5534A and 2.5 dB noisier than the 5532A, and it is not cheap. The noise figure is now 6.3 dB, 
which to a practised eye would show that something had gone amiss in the design process. 
 Case 9: The LM4562 BJT-input opamp gives significant noise improvements over the 
5534/5532 when used in low-impedance circuitry, because its e n is lower at 2.7 nV√ Hz. 
However, the impedances we are dealing with here are not low, and the i n , at 1.6 pA√ Hz, 
is four times that of the 5534A, leading us to think it will not do well here. We are sadly 
correct, with EIN deteriorating to 117.9 dBu and the noise figure an unimpressive 7.7 dB. 
The LM4562 is almost 5 dB noisier than the 5534A and at the time of writing is a lot more 
expensive. Measurements confirm a 5 dB disadvantage. 
 Case 10: The OP275 has both BJT and FET input devices. Regrettably this appears to 
give both high voltage noise and high current noise, resulting in a discouraging EIN of 
117.3 dBu. It is expensive. 

318 Chapter 11
 Case 11: The TL072 with its FET input has very high voltage noise at 18 nV√ Hz but 
low current noise. We can expect a poor performance. We duly get it, with EIN rising to 
113.4 dBu and a very indifferent noise figure of 12.2 dB. The TL072 is 9.1 dB noisier than a 
5534A, and 8.4 dB noisier than a 5532A. The latter figure is confirmed (within experimental 
error, anyway) by the data listed in the section below on noise measurements. There is now 
no reason to use a TL072 in an MM preamp; it must be one of the worst you could pick. 
 Case 12: Just for historical interest I tried out the LM741. The voltage noise measures about 
20 nV√ Hz. I have no figures for the current noise, but I think it’s safe to assume it won’t be 
better than a 5532, so I have used 0.7 pA√ Hz. Predictably the noise is the highest yet, with an 
EIN of 112.4 dBu, but it is a matter for some thought that despite using an ancient part it is 
only 10 dB worse than the 5534A. 
 You may be wondering what has happened to other well-known opamps, particularly the 
OP-27 and the LT1028. Both are sometimes recommended for audio use, because of their 
low e n s, but this ignores a serious problem. The OP-27 has a low e n and i n , and in fact gives 
a calculated EIN of 123.0 dB, which beats the 5532A noise, but when you measure it in 
real life it is actually several dB noisier; I have confirmed this several times. This is due to 
extra noise generated by bias-current cancellation circuitry. Correlated noise currents are 
fed into both inputs, and will only cancel if both inputs see the same impedance. In this 
MM-RIAA application the impedances are wildly different, and the result is much increased 
noise. This problem with the OP-27 was originally pointed out to me by Marcel van de 
Gevel [9]. 
 The LT1028 gives a poor performance in MM applications because while it has an 
appealingly low e n of 0.85 nV√ Hz, its i n is high at 1 pA√ Hz as a result of running big input 
BJTs at high collector currents. The EIN is by calculation 120.9 dBu, making it a shade 
quieter than the 5532A. But the LT1028 also has bias-current cancellation circuitry, and the 
data sheet explicitly states, ‘the cancellation circuitry injects two correlated current noise 
components into the two inputs.’ According to Gevel [9] the effective voltage noise in an MM 
application is about 39 nV√ Hz, so even the 741 would be a better choice. 
 Noise and A-weighting 
 The frequency response of human hearing is not flat, especially at lower listening levels 
(see  Chapter 13 for more on this). Some commentators therefore feel it is appropriate to 
use psychoacoustic weighting when studying noise levels. This is almost invariably ANSI 
A-weighting despite the fact that it is generally considered inaccurate, as it undervalues low 
frequencies. ANSI B-, C-, and D-weightings also exist but are not used in audio. The ITU-R 468 
weighting (CCIR-468) is much better but only rarely used. I prefer unweighted measurements as 
you are one step closer to the original data. 

MM inputs: noise and distortion 319
 The A-weighting curve is shown in  Figure 11.3 . It approximately follows the Fletcher-
Munson 40-phon line. It passes through 0 dB at 1 kHz, and has a maximum gain of 1.3 dB 
at 2.5 kHz. The low-frequency roll-off steadily steepens as frequency falls, while the high-
frequency roll-off is at 12 dB/octave (3 dB at 12 kHz). 
 A-weighting reduces the level of white noise by 4.4 dB, but as noted earlier we are not dealing 
with white noise as the spectrum is altered by the effects of L gen  and the RIAA equalisation. 
 You may therefore be wondering how the unweighted results described above will be affected 
by the application of A-weighting. Will the order of merit in  Table 11.2 be upset? 
 Table 11.3 shows the effects of A-weighting on selected cases from  Table 11.2 . The noise 
level drops by between 2 and 4 dB, depending on the magnitude of voltage noise compared

to current noise. A-weighting does not introduce any revolutionary changes into the order of 
merit of the various amplifiers in  Table 11.2 . 
 RIAA noise measurements 
 In the past, many people who should have known better have recommended that MM input 
noise should be measured with a 1 kΩ load, presumably thinking that this emulates the 
resistance R gen , which is the only parameter in the cartridge actually generating noise  the 
inductance is of course noiseless. This overlooks the massive effect that the inductance has in 
making the impedance seen at the preamp input rise very strongly with frequency, so that at 
higher frequencies most of the input noise actually comes from the 47 kΩ loading resistance. 
I am grateful to Marcel van de Gevel for drawing my attention to some of the deeper 
implications of this point [11]. 
 The importance of using a real cartridge load is demonstrated in  Table 11.4 , where the 
noise performance of a TL072 and a 5532 are compared. The TL072 result is 0.8 dB 
too low, and 5532 result 4.9 dB too low  a hefty error. In general results with the 1 kΩ 
resistor will always be too low, by a variable amount. In this case you still get the right 
overall answer  i.e. you should use a 5532 for least noise  but the dB difference 
between the two has been exaggerated by almost a factor of two, by undervaluing the 5532 
current noise. 
 The 1 kΩ recommendation was perhaps made because the obvious measurement method of 
loading the input with a MM cartridge has serious difficulties with hum from the ambient 
magnetic fields. To get useful results it is essential to enclose the cartridge completely in a 
grounded mu-metal can  I use one from a redundant microphone transformer and it works 
very well. I suppose the ideal load would be a toroidal inductor, but it would be an expensive 
custom part. It is also necessary to use complete electrostatic screening of the amplifier itself. 
If it has a 22 μF input coupling capacitor and the input is short-circuited, the impedance 
downstream of the capacitor is 145 Ω at 50 Hz, which is enough to make it susceptible to 
electrostatic hum pickup.

MM inputs: noise and distortion 321
 RIAA amps driven from MC head amp 
 All the discussion above deals with an RIAA preamplifier driven by an MM cartridge. As 
we noted at the start, the MM RIAA stage may also be driven from an MC head amp. The 
noise conditions for the RIAA amplifier are quite different, as it is now fed from a very 
low impedance, plus probably a series resistor in series with the MC amp output to give 
stability against stray capacitances. My current MC head amp design (see  Chapter 12 ) has an 
EIN of 141.5 dBu with a 3.3 Ω input source resistance. Its gain is 30 dB, so the output 
noise is 111.5 dBu. The series output resistor is 47 Ω; its Johnson noise at 135 dBu is 
negligible, and likewise the effect of the RIAA stage input noise flowing in it. The noise at 
the output of the RIAA stage is then 85.7 dBu, which is higher than any of the figures in 
 Table 11.2 except those for TL072 and LM741. In this situation the value of R0 is relatively 
unimportant. 
 Cartridge load synthesis for lower noise 
 Going back to  Table 11.2 above, you will recall that when we were examining the situation 
with the amplifier and feedback network noise switched off, adding in the Johnson noise from 
the 47 kΩ loading resistor R in caused the output noise to rise by 3.2 dB. In real conditions 
with amplifier noise included the effect is obviously less dramatic, but it is still significant. 
For the 5534A (Case 6a), the removal of the noise from R in (but  not the loading effect of R in ) 
reduces the noise output by 1.5 dB.  Table 11.5 summarises the results for various amplifier 
options; the amplifier noise is unaffected, so the noisier the technology used, the less the 
improvement.

 This may appear to be utterly academic, because the cartridge must be loaded with 47 kΩ to 
get the correct response. This is true,  but it does not have to be loaded with a physical 47 kΩ 
resistor . An electronic circuit that has the V/I characteristics of a 47 kΩ resistor, but lower 
noise, will do the job very well. Such a circuit may seem like a tall order  it will, after all, 
be connected at the very input, where noise is critical, but unusually the task is not as difficult 
as it seems. 
 Figure 11.4a shows the basic principle. The 47 kΩ R in is replaced with a 1 MΩ resistor 
whose bottom end is driven with a voltage that is phase-inverted and 20.27 times that at the 
top end. If we conceptually split the 1 MΩ resistor into two parts of 47 kΩ and 953 kΩ, a 
little light mathematics shows that with 20.27 times V in at the output of A2, the voltage at 
the 47 kΩ953 kΩ junction A is zero, and so as far as the cartridge is concerned it is looking 
at a 47 kΩ resistance to ground. However, the physical component is 1 MΩ, and the Johnson 
current noise it produces is less than that from a 47 kΩ (Johnson current noise is just the 
usual Johnson voltage noise applied through the resistance in question). The point here is 
that the apparent resistor value has increased by 21.27 times, but the Johnson noise has only 
increased by 4.61 times, because of the square-root in the Johnson equation; thus the current 
noise injected by R in is also reduced by 4.61 times. The noise reduction gained with a 5534A 
(Case 6a) is 1.3 dB, which is very close to the 1.5 dB improvement obtained by switching off 
the R in noise completely. If a resistor larger than 1 MΩ is used, slightly more noise reduction 
can be obtained, but that would need more gain in A2 and we would soon reach the point 
where it would clip before A1, restricting headroom. In this case we get a very good noise 
figure of 1.8 dB, though the lowest noise output comes from the 2SB737 at 70 μA. 
 The implementation made known by Gevel [9] is shown in  Figure 11.4b . This ingenious 
circuit uses the current flowing through the feedback resistor R0 to drive a shunt feedback 
Figure 11.4: Electronic load synthesis: a) the basic principle, b) the Gevel circuit

MM inputs: noise and distortion 323
stage around A2. With suitable scaling of R3 (note that here it has an E96 value) the output 
voltage of A2 is at the right level and correctly phase-inverted. When I first saw this circuit I 
had reservations about connecting R0 to a virtual ground rather than a real one, and thought 
that extra noise from A2 might find its way back up R0 into the main path (I hasten to add 
that these fears may be quite unjustified, and I have not found time so far to put them to a 
practical test). The inverting signal given by this circuit is amplified by 20.5 times rather than 
20.27 but this has a negligible effect on the amount of noise-reduction. 
 Because of these reservations, I tried out my version of load-synthesis as shown in 
 Figure 11.5 . This uses the basic circuit of  Figure 11.4a ; it is important that the inverting stage 
A3 does not load the input with its 1 kΩ input resistor R4, so a unity-gain buffer A2 is added. 
The inverting signal is amplified by 20 times, not 20.27, but once again this has negligible 
effect on the noise-reduction. 
 In practical measurements with a 5534A as amplifier A1, I found that the noise improvement 
with a real cartridge load (Shure M75ED 2, cartridge parameters 610 Ω  470 mH) was 
indeed 1.3 dB, just as predicted, which is as nice a matching of theory and reality as you are 
likely to encounter in this world. There were no HF stability problems. Whether the 1.3 dB is 
worth the extra electronics is a good question; I say it’s worth having. 
 This technique has been called ‘electronic cooling’, presumably because it could be regarded 
as analogous to dipping the loading resistance in liquid nitrogen or whatever to reduce 
Figure 11.5: Electronic load synthesis: the Self circuit

324 Chapter 11
Johnson noise. I must admit I don’t like the term as it could be understood to mean that 
thermoelectric elements have been used to cool down the input stage, a technique I do not 
think has been used in hifi yet. I prefer to call it ‘electronic loading’, ‘active input impedance’ 
or ‘load synthesis’, the last being perhaps the most explicit. It would also be useful for tape 
head preamplifiers, but they are a bit of a minority interest these days. 
 The history of load synthesis 
 Yet again we encounter a technique that has a longer history than you might expect. It was 
referred to by Tomlinson Holman in his famous 1975 paper ‘New Factors In Phonograph 
Preamplifier Design’ [12] (which is still well worth reading) as a recent innovation: 
 ‘Two noise reduction techniques have appeared in recent designs. One is to use quite 
low impedances in the RIAA feedback. . . . The second involves the use of a synthesized 
input impedance through the use of an extra feedback loop which bootstraps the cartridge 
termination resistor to reduce its noise contribution. One commercial embodiment of the 
bootstrap method produced a signal-to-noise ratio of 85 dB re 10 mV, 1 kHz input, ANSI ‘A’ 
weighted with a cartridge input.’ For comparison, assuming the reference level is 10 mVrms, 
the 5534A in Case 6a gives an unweighted S/N ratio of 84.7 dB without load synthesis, and 
86.0 dB with it. 
 Bootstrapping is not really the right term; load synthesis is more ‘anti-bootstrapping’ in that 
it makes a large impedance look like a small one by applying a voltage in anti-phase, whereas 
conventional bootstrapping makes a small impedance look like a large one by applying a 
voltage in phase. I have no idea which ‘commercial embodiment’ he was talking about, and I 
would be glad to hear any suggestions. 
 The technique was analysed by Hoeffelman and Meys in the JAES in 1978 [13]. So far as I 
can find, there are no patents on this subject. 
 Distortion in MM RIAA ampliﬁ ers 
 An RIAA stage with a gain of 30 dB at 1 kHz will have a gain of about 50 dB at 20 Hz; 
that is high for a single opamp stage. The closed-loop gain at HF is about 10 dB so the 
feedback factor can be maintained there without problems; fortunately, the RIAA curve 
roughly follows the 6 dB/octave fall in open-loop gain. The CM voltage is very small and 
should not cause distortion. 
 Figure 11.6 shows the distortion at 5 V, 7 V, and 9 Vrms. The distortion at LF is mainly second 
harmonic. It was checked that this was not coming from C0; increasing it from 220 μF to 
1000/6V3 gave no improvement. The sudden increase in distortion at about 27 kHz for the 

MM inputs: noise and distortion 325
9 Vrms case occurs when the current drawn by the RIAA network exceeds the capability of the 
5534A. Note that 9 Vrms is a whole 36 dB above the nominal operating level of 150 mVrms. 
 The distortion will be aggravated by external loading. Here we have just the HF correction 
pole, which only places an extra load on the opamp at HF. If it is removed the distortion at 
low and middle frequencies is completely unchanged, but the sudden increase in distortion 
for the 9 Vrms case now occurs at the higher frequency of 36 kHz. 
 It is clear that the 5534A is not distortion-free in this application. The LM4562 has superior 
linearity and load-driving capabilities in general, though we know that the noise performance 
will be inferior due to its higher current noise. The results in   Figure 11.7 are convincing. 
 The rise in distortion at LF has been completely eliminated, but disappointingly the HF 
distortion is barely improved at all. It is disconcerting that the opamp output is no more 
effective at driving the RIAA feedback network, given the excellent drive capabilities of the 
LM4562 into resistive loads. I suspect the reason is that the output stage uses VI limiting 
for overload protection, as opposed to the simple current-limiting used in the 5532, and this 
makes it more likely to come into action when driving a highly reactive load like an RIAA

amendment, no external load except correction pole

326 Chapter 11
network, which above 1 kHz looks pretty much like a capacitance in series with a low-value 
resistor (R0) connected to ground. The use of a ‘helper’ opamp to assist in driving the RIAA 
network would be likely to reduce the distortion (see  Chapter 1 ).  Figure 11.7 confirms 
that the LF distortion is wholly from the 5534 opamp and is nothing to do with capacitor 
distortion. 
 Conclusions 
 While MM RIAA cartridge noise is a complicated business, the clear result is that the 
5534A is the cheapest and easiest way to get within 3 dB of the theoretical best noise 
performance. This is because it not only has low noise in general, but also a favourable 
balance between its voltage noise and current noise for an MM source. It is a happy chance 
that it is inexpensive. To get within 2 dB of perfection, another 5532 can be added to 
implement load-synthesis. 
 Money can be saved by using a 5532 but you are then 5 dB from theoretical best noise, and 
running two channels through the same package is very likely to compromise crosstalk.

 Moving-coil head ampliﬁ ers 
 Moving-coil cartridges are generally accepted to have a better tracking performance than 
moving-magnet cartridges because the moving element is a set of lightweight coils rather than 
a magnet which is inevitably made of a relatively dense alloy. Because the coils must be light, 
they consist of relatively few turns and the output voltage is very low, typically in the range 100 
to 550 μVrms at a velocity of 5 cm/sec, compared with 5 mVrms from the average moving-
magnet cartridge. Fortunately this low output comes from a very low impedance, which, by 
various technical means, allows an acceptable signal-to-noise performance to be obtained. 
 Moving-coil cartridge characteristics 
 There is much greater variation in impedance and output across the available range of 
moving-coil cartridges than for moving-magnet cartridges. The range quoted above is already 
much wider, but including the extremes currently on the market (2009) the output range 
is from 40 to 2500 μV, a remarkably wide span of 62 times or 36 dB. This is illustrated in 
 Figure 12.1 , which shows the results of a survey of 85 different MC cartridges (note that 
the ranges for the columns are wider at the right side of the diagram). When I first became 
involved in designing MC amplifiers in 1986, I compiled a similar chart [1] and it is 
interesting to note that the same features occurred – there are two separate clusters around 
100–300 μV and 500–700 μV, and the lowest output is still 40 μV from an Audio Note 
cartridge (the loLtd model). The highest output of 2.5 mV comes from the Benz Micro H2, 
and this is only 6 dB below an MM cartridge. 
 Assuming that a conventional MM input stage is being used to raise 5 mV to nominal internal 
level and perform the RIAA equalisation, the Audio Note cartridge requires a gain of 125 
times or 42 dB. The cartridge cluster around 200 μV output needs 25 times or 28 dB, 
while the 500 μV cluster requires 10 times or 20 dB. If an amplifier is to cover the whole 
range of MC cartridges available, some form of gain switching is highly desirable.  
 Cartridge impedances also vary markedly, over a range from 1 Ω (Audio Note loLtd) to 
160 Ω (Denon DL-110 and DL160), with impedance increasing with output level, as you 
would expect – there are more turns of wire in the coils. The inductance of MC cartridges 

330 Chapter 12
is very low and their source impedance is normally treated as purely resistive. The 
recommended load impedances are also resistive (unlike the R–C combinations often used 
with MM cartridges) and are usually quoted as a minimum load resistance. Once more the 
variation is wide, from 3 Ω (Audio Note loLtd again) to 47 kΩ (Denon DL-110 and DL160 
again) but a 100 Ω input load will be high enough for most of the cartridges surveyed, 
and 500 Ω will work for almost all of them. The Audio Note loLtd cartridge is unusual in 
another way – its magnetic field is produced not by permanent magnets but a DC-powered 
electromagnet, which presumably requires a very pure supply indeed. The manufacturers 
whose cartridges were included in the survey are listed in  Table 12.1.  
 The limits on MC noise performance 
 Because MC cartridges can be modelled for noise purposes simply as their coil resistance, 
it is straightforward to calculate the best signal/noise ratio possible. Even if we assume a 
noiseless amplifier, the Johnson noise from the coil resistance sets an inescapable limit;

Moving-coil inputs 331
comparing this with the cartridge output gives the maximum signal/noise ratio. This was 
done for all the cartridges used to compile  Figure 12.1 , using the manufacturer’s specs and 
the answers varied from 63.9 to 90.8 dB, which is a pretty big spread (this does not include 
RIAA equalisation). 
 In practice things will be worse. Even if we carry on assuming a noiseless amplifier, there 
is resistance in the tone-arm wiring, which has to be very thin for flexibility, and a bit more 
in the cable connecting the turntable to the preamp. Calculating the same figures for MM 
cartridges is a good deal more complicated because of the significant cartridge inductance 
(see  Chapter 11 ). 
 Ampliﬁ cation strategies 
 There are two ways to achieve the high gains required for these low-output cartridges. In 
the most common method, a standard MM input stage, with RIAA equalisation, can be 
switched to either accept an MC input directly or the output of a specialised MC input stage 
which gives the extra gain needed; this may be either a step-up transformer or an amplifier 
configured to work well with very low source resistances. The large amount of gain required 
is split between the two stages, which makes it easier to achieve. Alternatively, a single stage 
can be used with switched gain; but this is not too hot an idea as: 
1.  Switchable gain makes accurate RIAA equalisation much harder. 
2.  For good noise performance, the input device operating current needs to be low for MM 
use (where it sees a high impedance) and high for MC use (where it sees a very low 
impedance). Making this operating current switchable would be a complicated business. 
3.  Achieving the very high gain required for MC operation together with low distortion and 
adequate bandwidth will be a challenge. It is unlikely to be possible with a single opamp, 
and so there is little likelihood of any saving on parts. 
 Moving-coil transformers 
 If you have a very low output voltage and very low impedance, an obvious way to deal 
with this is by using a step-up transformer to raise the voltage to the level where it can 
be appropriately applied to a moving-magnet amplifier stage, such as those discussed 
in  Chapter 8 . Such a transformer has most of the usual disadvantages such as frequency 
response problems and cost, though for hifi use the weight is not a difficulty, and non-
linearity should not be an issue because of the very low signal levels. 
 In this application the cost is increased by the need for very high immunity to hum fields. 
While it is relatively straightforward to make transformers that have high immunity to 

332 Chapter 12
external magnetic fields, particularly if they are toroidal in construction, it is not cheap, 
because the mu-metal cans that are required for the sort of immunity necessary are difficult 
to manufacture. The root of the problem is that the signal being handled is so very small. 
The transformer is usually working in a modern house which can have surprisingly large 
hum fields, and generally presents a hostile environment for very-low-signal transformers, 
so very good immunity indeed is required; some manufacturers use two nested screening 
cans, separately grounded, to achieve this, as shown in  Figure 12.2 . An inter-winding 
electrostatic screen is usually fitted. A stereo MC input naturally requires  two of these costly 
transformers. 
 MC transformers are designed with low primary winding resistances, typically 2 or 3 Ω, 
to minimise the Johnson noise contribution from the transformer. Some transformers have 
windings made of silver rather than copper wire, but the conductivity of silver is only 5% 
higher than that of copper, and the increase in cost is startling. At the time of writing one 
brand of silver-wound transformer costs more than £1200 – each, not for a pair. 
 Because of the great variation in cartridge output levels and impedances some manufacturers 
(e.g. Jensen) offer transformers with two or three primary windings, which can be connected 
in series, parallel, or series-parallel to accommodate a wide variety of cartridges.  
 A transformer secondary must be correctly loaded to give the flattest possible frequency 
response, and this usually means that a Zobel R-C network must be connected across it, 
as explained in  Chapter 18 on line inputs. This is Rd and Cd in   Figure 12.2 , where they 
have typical values. The values required depend not only on the transformer design but 
 Figure 12.2 : A typical MC step-up transformer circuit with twin primaries wired in parallel, dual 
screening cans, and Zobel network Rd, Cd across the secondary. Rin, Cin are the usual MM input 
loading components 

Moving-coil inputs 333
also somewhat on the cartridge impedance, and some manufacturers such as Jensen are 
praiseworthily thorough in giving secondary loading recommendations for a wide range of 
cartridge impedances. 
 The very wide variation in cartridge outputs means that the step-up ratio of the transformer 
must be matched to the cartridge to get an output around 5 mV that is suitable for an 
MM input amplifier. For example, Jensen offer basic step-up ratios from 1:8 to 1:37. The 
maximum ratio is limited not only by transformer design issues but by the fact that the 
loading on the secondary is, as with all transformers, transferred to the primary divided by the 
square of the turns ratio. A 1:37 transformer connected to the 47 kΩ input impedance of an 
MM stage will have an impedance looking into the primary of only 34 Ω; such a transformer 
would, however, only be used with a very low-impedance low-output cartridge, which would 
be quite happy with such a loading. It is of course possible to arrange the input switching so 
the 47 kΩ input load is on the MM socket side of the MC/MM switch; the MM amplifier can 
then have a substantially higher input impedance. 
 Moving-coil input ampliﬁ ers 
 The high cost of transformers means that there is a strong incentive to come up with an 
electronic solution to the amplification problem. The only thing that makes it possible to 
achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio is that the very small signal comes from a very low 
source impedance. 
 MC head-amplifiers come in many forms, but almost all in use today can be classified 
into one of the topologies shown in  Figure 12.3 , all of which use series-feedback. The 
configuration in   Figure 12.3a   is a complementary-feedback pair using a single input transistor 
chosen to have a low base series resistance R b . The feedback network must also have a low 
impedance to prevent its Johnson noise from dominating the overall noise output, and this 
puts a heavy load on the second transistor. Typically a gain of 47 times will be implemented 
with an upper feedback resistor of 100 Ω and a lower resistor of 2 Ω, a total load on the 
amplifier output of 102 Ω. The combination of limited open-loop gain and the heavy load 
of the feedback network means that both linearity and maximum output level tend to be 
uninspiring, and the distortion performance is only acceptable because the signals are so 
small. An amplifier of this type is analysed in reference [2].  
 Figure 12.3b shows a classic configuration where multiple transistors are operated in parallel 
so that their gains add but their uncorrelated noise partly cancels. Two transistors gives a 3 dB 
improvement, four transistors 6 dB, and so on. The gain block A is traditionally one or two 
discrete devices, which again have difficulty in driving the low-impedance feedback network. 
Attention is usually paid to ensuring proper current-sharing between the input devices. 
This can be done by adding low-value emitter resistors to swamp V be varia tions; they are 

334 Chapter 12
effectively in series with the input path, and therefore degrade the noise performance unless 
each resistor is individually decou pled with a large electrolytic. Alternatively, each transistor 
can be given its own DC feedback loop to set up its collector current. For examples of this 
kind of circuitry see reference [3]. 
 Figure 12.3c shows the series-pair configuration. This simple arrangement uses two 
complementary input transistors to achieve a 3 dB noise improvement without current-sharing

current imbalances. There is no feedback, so linearity is poor. The biasing arrangements are 
not shown. 
 Figure 12.3d is an enhancement of  Figure 12.3a , with the input transistor inverted in 
polarity and the spadework of providing open-loop gain and output drive capability 
entrusted to an opamp. The much increased feedback gives excellent linearity, and 
less than 0.002% THD at full output may be confidently expected. However, problems 
remain. Rf 2  must be very low in value, as it is effectively in series with the input and will 
degrade the noise performance accordingly. If Rf 2  is 10 Ω (which is on the high side) 
C f must be very large; for example, 1000 μF to limit the LF roll-off to 1 dB at 30 Hz. 
Adopting a quieter 3.3 Ω for the Rf 2 position gives significantly lower noise but demands 
4700 μF to give 3 dB at 10 Hz; this is not elegant and leads to doubts as to whether the 
ESR of the capacitor will cause trouble. C f is essential to reduce the gain to unity at DC 
because there is 0.6 V on the input device emitter, and we don’t want to amplify that by 
fifty times. 
 The 0.6 V offset can be eliminated by the use of a differential pair, as in  Figure 12.3e . 
This cancels out the V be of the input transistor TR 1 , at the cost of some degradation in noise 
performance. The pious hope is that the DC offset is so much smaller that if C f is omitted, 
and the offset is amplified by the full AC gain, the output voltage swing will not be seriously 
reduced. The noise degradation incurred by using a differential pair was measured at about 
2.8 dB. Another objection to this circuit is that the offset at the output is still non-negligible, 
about 1 V, mostly due to the base bias current flowing through R10. A DC-blocking capacitor 
on the output is essential.  
 An effective MC ampliﬁ er conﬁ guration 
 Finding none of these configurations satisfactory, I evolved the configuration shown as a 
block diagram in  Figure 12.4 . There is no C f in the feedback loop, and indeed no overall 
DC feedback at all. The input transistor and the opamp each have their own DC feedback 
systems. The transistor relies on simple shunt negative feedback via DC loop 1; the opamp 
has its output held precisely to a DC level of 0 V by the integrator A2 which acts as DC loop 2. 
This senses the mean output level, and sets up a voltage on the non-inverting input of A1 
that is very close to that at Q 1 collector, such that the output stays firmly at zero. The time-
constant is made large enough to ensure that an ample amount of open-loop gain exists at 
the lowest audio frequencies. Too short a time-constant will give a rapid rise in distortion as 
frequency falls. Any changes in the direct voltage on Q1 collector are completely uncoupled 
from the output, but AC feedback passes through Rf 1 as usual and ensures that the overall 
linearity is near-perfect, as is often the case with transistor opamp hybrid circuits. Due to 

336 Chapter 12
the high open-loop gain of A the AC signal on Q1 collector is very small and so shunt AC 
feedback through DC loop 1 does not significantly reduce the input impedance of the overall 
amplifier, which is about 8 kΩ. 
 As we have seen, MC cartridges vary greatly in their output and different amplifier gain 
settings are highly desirable. Usually it would be simple enough to alter Rf 1 or Rf 2 ,  but here 
it is not quite so simple. The resistance Rf 2 is not amenable to alteration, as it is kept to the 
low value of 3.3 Ω by noise considerations, while Rf 1 must be kept up to a reasonable value 
so that it can be driven to a full voltage swing by an opamp output. This means a minimum of 
500 Ω for the 5534/2. It is intriguing that amplifiers whose output is measured in milliVolts 
are required to handle so much current. 
 These two values fix a minimum closed-loop gain of about 44 dB, which is much too high 
for all but the most insensitive cartridges. My solution was to use a ladder output attenuator 
to reduce the overall gain; this would be anathema in a conventional signal path, because of 
the loss of headroom involved, but since even an output of 300 mVrms would be enough to 
overload virtually all MM amplifiers, we can afford to be prodigal with it. If the gain of the 
head amplifier is set to be a convenient 200 times (46 dB) then adding output attenuation 
to reduce the overall gain to a more useful 20 dB still allows a maximum output of 
480 mVrms. Lesser degrees of attenuation to give intermediate gains allow greater outputs, 
and these are summarized in  Table 12.2. For testing, an Ortofon MC10 was used with 26 dB 
of gain, giving similar output levels to MM cartridges. This highly successful cartridge was in 
production for 30 years and has only recently been superseded; its impedance is 3.3 Ω.

 A final constraint on the attenuator is the need for low output impedances so the succeeding 
MM input stage can give a good noise performance. The MM input should have been 
optimized to give its best Noise Figure with relatively high source impedances, but a 
low source impedance will still reduce its actual noise output. This means that an output 
attenuator will need low resistor values, imposing yet more loading on the unfortunate 
opamp. This problem was solved by making the attenuator ladder an integral part of the AC 
feedback loop, as shown in  Figure 12.5 . This is practicable because it is known that the input 
impedance of the following MM stage will be too high at 47 kΩ to cause significant gain 
variations.

 The complete circuit 
 This is shown in  Figure 12.5 , and closely follows  Figure 12.4 , though you will note that the 
input devices have suddenly multiplied themselves by three. Capacitor C1 is soldered on the 
back of the MC input phono sockets and is intended for EMC immunity rather than cartridge 
response modification. If the need for more capacitive or resistive loading is felt, then extra 
components may be freely connected in parallel with R1. If R1 is raised in value, then load 
resistances of 5 kΩ or more are possible, as the impedance looking into C 2 is about 8 kΩ. 
Capacitor C2 is large to give the input devices the full benefit of the low source impedance, 
and its value should not be altered. Resistors R2, R3   make up DC loop 1, setting the operating 
conditions of Q1, Q2, Q3 while R 4 is the collector load, decoupled from the supply rail by 
C9 and R5, which are shared between two stereo channels. Opamp IC1 is a half of a 5532, 
providing most of the AC open-loop gain, and is stabilized at HF by C4. R6 has no real effect 
on normal operation, but is included to give IC1 a modicum of DC negative feedback and 
hence tidy behaviour at power-up, which would otherwise be slow due to the charging time 
of C2 .  IC2, half of a TL072, is the integrator that forms DC loop 2, its time-constant carefully 
chosen to give ample open-loop gain from IC1 at low frequencies, while avoiding peaking in 
the LF response that could occur due to the second time-constant of C2. 
 The ladder resistors R8–R12 make up the combined feedback network and output attenuator, 
the gain being selected by a push-on link in the prototype. A rotary switch could be used 
instead, but this should  not be operated with the system volume up as this will cause loud 
clicks, due to the emitter current (about 4 mA) of Q1–Q3 flowing through R7, which causes 
voltage drops down the divider chain. Note that the current through R7 flows down the 
ground connection back to the PSU. Output resistor R15 ensures stability when driving 
screened cables, and C5 is included to eliminate any trace of DC offset from the output. 
 The power supply rails do not need to be especially quiet and a normal opamp supply is quite 
adequate. 
 Performance 
 The input transistor originally chosen was the 2N4403, a type that was acknowledged as 
superior for this kind of application for some years, due to its low R b of about 40 Ω. A single 
device used in the circuit of  Figure 12.5 gives an EIN of 138 dB with a 4 mA collector 
current and a 3.3 Ω source resistance. The Johnson noise from 3.3 Ω is 147.4 dBu, so 
we have a noise figure of 9.4 dB. It was then con sistently found that putting devices in 
parallel without any current-sharing precautions whatever always resulted in a significant 
improvement in noise performance. On average, adding a second transistor reduced noise by 
1.2 dB, and adding a third reduced it by another 0.5 dB, giving an EIN of 139.7 dBu and an 
NF of 7.7 dB. Beyond this, further multiplication was judged unprofitable, so a triple-device 

Moving-coil inputs 339
input was settled on. The current-sharing under these conditions was checked by measuring 
the voltage across 100 Ω resistors temporarily inserted in the collector paths. With 3.4 mA as 
the total current for the array it was found after much device-swapping that the worst case of 
imbalance was 0.97 mA in one transistor and 1.26 mA in another. The transistors were not 
all from the same batch. It appears that, for this device at least, matching is good enough to 
make simple paralleling practical. 
 A superior device for low source impedances was the purpose-designed 2SB737, with a 
stunningly low R b of 2 Ω. Three of them improved the EIN to 141.0 dBu and the NF to 
6.4 dB, albeit at significant cost. Sadly it is now obsolete (why, for heaven’s sake?) but can 
still be obtained from specialised suppliers such as the Signal Transfer Company [4]. 
 You will have spotted that R7, at 3.3 Ω, generates as much noise as the source impedance; 
this only degrades the noise figure by 1.4 dB, rather than 3 dB, as most of the noise comes 
from the transistors. 
 It would be instructive to com pare this design with other MC preamplifiers, but it is not 
at all easy as their noise performance is specified in so many different ways it is virtually 
impossible to reduce them all to a similar form, particularly without know ing the spectral 
distribution of the noise (this chapter has dealt until now with unweighted noise referred 
to the input, over a 400 Hz–20 kHz bandwidth, and with RIAA equalisation  not taken into 
account). Nonetheless, I suggest that this design is quieter than most, being within almost 
6 dB of the theoretical minimum, with clearly limited scope for improvement. Burkhard 
Vogel has written an excellent article on the calculation and comparison of MC signal-to-
noise ratios [5]. 
 The performance is summarised in  Table 12.3. Careful grounding is needed if the noise and 
crosstalk performance quoted is to be obtained.  
 When connected to a RIAA-equalised MM stage as described in  Chapter 7 , the noise output 
from the MM stage is 93.9 dBu at 10 times MC gain, and 85.8 dBu at 50 times. In the 
10 times case, the MC noise is actually 1.7 dB lower than for MM mode.

 Volume controls 
 Volume controls 
 A volume control is the most essential knob on a preamplifier – in fact the unhappily named 
‘passive preamplifiers’ usually consist of nothing else but a volume control and an input 
selector switch. Volume controls in one guise or another are also freely distributed on the 
control surfaces of mixing consoles, examples being the auxiliary sends and the faders. 
 A volume control for a hifi preamplifier needs to cover at least a 50 dB range, with a 
reasonable approach to a logarithmic (i.e. linear-in dB) law, and have a channel balance better 
than ±1 dB over this range if noticeable stereo image shift is to be avoided when the volume 
is altered. 
 The simplest volume control is a potentiometer. These components, which are invariably 
called ‘pots’ in practice, come with various control laws, such as linear, logarithmic, anti-
logarithmic, and so on. The control law is still sometimes called the ‘taper’ which is a 
historical reference to when the resistance element was actually physically tapered, so the 
rate of change of resistance from track-end to wiper could be different at different angular 
settings. Pots are no longer made this way, but the term has stuck around. An ‘audio-taper’ 
pot usually refers to a logarithmic type intended as a volume control. 
 All simple volume controls have the highest output impedance at the wiper at the 26 dB 
setting. For a linear pot this is when the control is rotated halfway towards the maximum, 
at the twelve o’clock position. For a log pot it will be at a higher setting, around three 
o’clock. The maximum impedance is significant because it usually sets the worst-case noise 
performance of the following amplification stage. The resistance value of a volume control 
should be as low as possible, given the loading/distortion characteristics of the stage driving 
it. This is sometimes called ‘low-impedance design’. Lower resistances mean: 
1.  Less Johnson noise from the pot track resistance 
2.  Less noise from the current-noise component of the following stage 
3.  Less likelihood of capacitive crosstalk from neighbouring circuitry 
4.  Less likelihood of hum and noise pickup. 

342 Chapter 13
 Volume control laws 
 What constitutes the optimal volume control law? One answer is a strictly logarithmic or 
linear-in dB law, but this is in fact somewhat less than ideal, as an excessive amount of 
the pot rotation is used for very high and very low volume settings that are rarely used. 
It is therefore usual to have a law that is flatter in its central section, but falls off with 
increasing rapidity towards the low volume end – see the fader law later in this chapter. 
Sometimes the law steepens at the high-volume end as well but this is somewhat less 
common. 
 A linear pot is a simple thing – the output is proportional to the angular control setting, and 
this is usually pretty accurate, depending only on the integrity of the mechanical construction. 
Linear pots are given the code letter ‘B’. See  Table 13.1 for more code letters. 
 Log controls are rather less satisfactory. A typical log pot is not a precision attenuator with 
a fixed number of dB attenuation for each 10 degrees of shaft rotation. It is instead made 
up of two or three linear slopes that roughly approximate a logarithmic law, produced by 
superimposing two or three sections of track made with different resistivity material, the 
overlap usually being towards the bottom end of the control setting, such as 20% of full 
rotation (see  Figure 13.1 ). These pots are usually given the code letter ‘A’. 
 Anti-logarithmic pots are the same only constructed backwards, so that the slope change 
is at the top end of the control setting; these are typically used as gain controls for 
amplifying stages rather than as volume controls. These pots are usually given the code 
letter ‘C’. 
 There is a more extreme version of the anti-logarithmic law where the slope change occurs 
at 10% of rotation instead of 20%. These are useful where you want to control the gain of 
an amplifying stage over a wide range, and still have something like a linear-in-dB control 
law. Typically they are used to set the gain of microphone input amplifiers, which can have a 
gain range of 50 dB or more. These pots are given the code ‘RD’, which stands for Reverse-
D-law; I don’t think I have ever come across a non-reverse D-law. Some typical laws are 
shown in  Figure 13.1 .

 Please note that the code letters are not adhered to quite as consistently across the world as 
one might hope. The codes given in  Table 13.1 are those used by ALPS, one of the major 
pot makers, but other people use quite different allocations; for example, Radiohm, another 
major manufacturer, calls linear pots A and log pots B, but they agree that anti-log pots 
should be called C. Radiohm have several other laws called F, T, S, and X; for example, S is a 
symmetrical law apparently intended for use in balance controls. It clearly pays to check very 
carefully what system the manufacturer uses when you’re ordering parts. 
 The closeness of approach to an ideal logarithmic law is not really the most important 
characteristic of a volume control – spreading out the most-used middle region is more 
useful. Of much greater importance is the matching between the two halves of a stereo volume 
control. It is common for the channel balance of log pots to deteriorate quite markedly at low 
volume settings, causing the stereo image to shift as the volume is altered. You may take it 
from me that customers really do complain about this, and so a good deal of ingenuity has 
been applied in attempts to extract good performance from indifferent components.  
 An important point in the design of volume controls is that their offness – the amount of signal 
that gets through when the control is at its minimum – is not very critical. This is in glaring 
contrast to a level control such as an auxiliary send on a mixer channel (see  Chapter 22 ), where 
the maximum possible offness is very important indeed. A standard log pot will usually have 
an offness in the order of 290 dB with respect to fully up, and this is quite enough to render 
even a powerful hifi system effectively silent.

344 Chapter 13
 Loaded linear pots 
 Since ordinary log pots are not very accurate, many other ways of getting a log law have been 
tried. Trace 1 in  Figure 13.3 (for a linear pot with no loading) makes it clear that the use of an 
unmodified linear law for volume control really is not viable; the attenuation is all cramped 
up at the bottom end. A rough approximation to a logarithmic law can be made by loading the 
wiper of a linear pot with a fixed resistor R1 to ground, as shown in  Figure 13.2 .  
 Adding a loading resistor much improves the law, but the drawback is that this technique 
really only works for a limited range of attenuation – in fact it only works well if you are 
looking for a control that varies from around 0 to 220 dB. It is therefore suitable for power 
amp level controls and aux master gain controls (see  Chapter 22 for details of the latter), but 
is unlikely to be useful for a preamplifier gain control which needs a much wider logarithmic 
range.  Figure 13.3 shows how the law varies as the value of the loading resistor is changed, 
Figure 13.2: Resistive loading of a linear pot to approximate a logarithmic law
Figure 13.3: Resistive loading of a linear pot: the control laws plotted

Volume controls 345
and it is pretty clear that whatever its value, the slope of the control law around the middle 
range is only suitable for emulating the ideal log law labelled ‘20’. The value of the loading 
resistor for each trace number is given in  Table 13.2 .  
 Figure 13.3 shows that with the optimal loading value (Trace 2), the error in emulating a 0 to 
220 dB log range is very small, lying within ±0.5 dB over the range 0 to 216 dB; below this 
the error grows rapidly. This error for Trace 2 only is shown in  Figure 13.4.  
 Obtaining an accurate law naturally relies on having the right ratio between the pot track 
resistance and the loading resistor. The resistance of pot tracks is not controlled as closely as 
fixed resistors, their tolerance usually being specified as ±20%, so this presents a significant

balance-shift problem. The only solution would seem to be making the loading resistor 
trimmable, and this approach has been used in a master volume control by at least one mixing 
console manufacturer. 
 Figure 13.5 shows the effect on the control law of a ±20% pot track tolerance, with a loading 
resistor of 4k7 that is assumed to be accurate (trace 2 in  Figure 13.3 ). With the pot track 20% 
low in value, the loading resistor has less effect and we get the dotted line above the solid 
(nominal) line. If it is 20% high the loading resistor has more effect, giving the lower dotted 
line. The error around the middle of control rotation is about ±0.7 dB, which is enough to 
give obvious balance errors in a stereo volume control. If you are unlucky enough to have the 
two tracks 20% out in opposite directions, the error will be 1.4 dB.  
 Another snag to this approach is that when the control is fully up, the loading resistor is 
placed directly across the input to the volume control, reducing its impedance drastically and 
possibly causing unhappy loading effects on the stage upstream. However the main problem

is that the law is only good for a 0 to 220 dB range, inadequate for a volume control on a 
preamplifier. 
 The following stage must have a high enough impedance to not significantly affect the volume 
control law; this obviously also applies to plain logarithmic pots, and to all the passive 
controls described here. 
 Dual-action volume controls 
 In the previous section on loaded linear pots, we have seen that the control law is only 
acceptably logarithmic over a limited range – too limited for effective use as a volume control 
in a preamplifier, or as a fader or send control in a mixer. One way to fix this is the cascading 
of pots, so that their attenuation laws sum in dB. This approach does of course require the use 
of a four-gang pot for stereo, which may be objectionable because of increased cost, possible 
problems in sourcing, and a worsened volume-control feel. Nonetheless the technique can 
be useful, so we will give it a quick look.  
Figure 13.6: Dual-action volume controls: a) shows two linear pots cascaded, and b) is a linear 
pot cascaded with a loaded-linear pot

348 Chapter 13
 It is assumed there is no interaction between the two pots, so the second pot does not directly 
load the wiper of the first. This implies a buffer stage between them, as shown in  Figure 13.6 . 
There is no need for this to be a unity-gain stage, and in fact several stages can be interposed 
between the two pots. This gives what is usually called a  distributed gain control , which can 
be configured to give a better noise/headroom compromise than a single volume control.  
 Figure 13.7 shows a linear law (Trace 1) and the square-law (Trace 2) made by cascading two 
linear pots. 20 dB and 30 dB ideal log lines are shown for comparison, and it is pretty clear that 
while the square-law is much more usable than the linear law, it is still a long way from perfect. 
It does however, have the useful property that, assuming the wiper is very lightly loaded by the 
next stage, the gain is dependant only upon control rotation and not the ratio between fixed 1% 
resistors and a ±20% pot track resistance.  Figure 13.8 shows the deviation of the square-law 
from the 30 dB line; the error peaks at just over 13 dB before it plunges negative.  
 A  much better attempt at a log law can be made by cascading an unloaded linear pot with a 
loaded-linear pot; the resulting law is shown in  Figure 13.9 . Trace 1 is the law of the linear 
pot alone, and Trace 2 is the law of a loaded linear 10 kΩ pot with a 2.0 kΩ loading resistor 
R1 from wiper to ground, alone. The combination of the two is Trace 3, and it can be seen 
that this gives a very good fit to a 40 dB ideal log line, and good control over a range of at 
least 35 dB. 
Figure 13.7: The dual-action volume control: Trace 1 is a linear pot, while Trace 2 is a square-law 
obtained by cascading two ganged linear pots with buffering between them

Volume controls 349
 Figure 13.10 shows the deviation of the combined law from the 40 dB line; the law error now 
peaks at just over ±1 dB. Unfortunately, adding the loading resistor means that once more the 
gain is dependent on the ratio between a fixed resistor and the pot track resistance.  
 Passive volume controls of various types can of course also be cascaded with an active 
volume control stage, and this can be a good way to obtain a desired control law. This is dealt 
with later in this chapter. 
 Tapped volume controls 
 The control law of a linear pot can be radically altered if it has a centre-tap (see  Chapter 22 
for the use of tapped pots for LCR panning). This can be connected to a potential divider 
that has a low impedance compared with the pot track resistance, and the attenuation at the 
tap point altered independently of other parameters.  Figure 13.11 shows both unloaded and 
loaded versions of the arrangement.

log line

the ideal 40 dB log line. Much better than Figure 13.8

Volume controls 351
 The unloaded version shown in  Figure 13.11 a is arranged so that the attenuation at the tap is 
close to 220 dB. This gives the law shown in  Figure 13.12 ; it approximates to a 33 dB log 
line, but there is an abrupt change of slope as the pot wiper crosses the tapping point.  
 Note that the track resistance has to be a good deal higher than that of the fixed resistors, 
so that they control the level at the tap. This means that, with the values shown, the source 
impedance at the wiper can be as high as 12.5 kΩ when it is halfway between the tap and 
one end, and this may degrade the noise performance, particularly if the following stage 
has significant current noise. A normal 10 kΩ pot, of whatever law, has a maximum output 
impedance of only 2.5 kΩ. To match this figure the values shown would have to be scaled 
down by a factor of 5, so that R1 5 2k, R2 5 200 Ω, and the track resistance is a more normal 
10 kΩ. This scaling is quite practical, the load on the previous stage now being 1.62 kΩ.  
 The error is shown in  Figure 13.13 . This version of a tapped linear volume control covers a 
range of about 30 dB, and almost keeps the errors within ±3 dB; but that abrupt change of 
slope at the tap point is somewhat less than ideal.  
 A much better approach to a log law is possible if a loading resistor is added to the wiper, as 
with the loaded linear pot already examined. See Figure 13.11b for the circuit arrangement 
and  Figure 13.14 for the control law. If the resistors are correctly chosen, using the ratios 
given in Figure 13.11b, the law can be arranged to have no change of slope at the tapping,

and the deviation from a 40 dB ideal line will be less than 1 dB over the range from 0 to 
238 dB. The exact values of the resistors are given rather than the nearest preferred values. It 
is clear that this is a very effective way of giving an accurate law over a wide range, and it is 
widely used in making high-quality slide faders, using multiple taps and a conductive plastic 
track. Note that the accuracy still depends on good control of the track resistance value 
compared with the fixed resistors. 
 If the value of the resistors connected to the tap is such that the loading effect on the previous 
stage becomes excessive, one possible solution is shown in Figure 13.11c, where the R1 and R2 
are kept reasonably high in value, and a unity-gain opamp buffer now holds the tap point in a 
vice-like grip due to its low output impedance. The disadvantage is that the noise of the opamp, 
and of R1 in parallel with R2, is fed directly through at full level when the wiper is near the tap. 
Often this will be at a lower level than the noise from the rest of the circuitry, but it is a point to 
watch. Note that because of the low-impedance drive from the opamp, the values of the fixed 
resistors will need to be altered from those of Figure 13.11b to get the best control law. 
 If the best possible noise performance is required, then it is better to increase the drive 
capability of the previous stage and keep the resistors connected to the tap low in value; if this is 
done by paralleling opamps then the noise performance will be improved rather than degraded. 
 Slide faders 
 So far as the design of the adjacent circuitry is concerned, a fader can normally be regarded 
as simply a slide-operated logarithmic potentiometer. Inexpensive faders are usually made 
using the same two-slope carbon-film construction as are rotary log volume controls, but

the more expensive and sophisticated types use a conductive-plastic track with multiple taps 
connected to a resistor ladder, as described in the previous section. This allows much better 
control over the fader law. 
 High-quality faders typically have a conductive-plastic track, contacted by multiple gold-
plate metal fingers to reduce noise during movement. A typical law for a 104 mm travel fader 
is shown in  Figure 13.15 . Note that a fader does not attempt to implement a linear-in-dB log 
scale; the attenuation is spread out over the top part of the travel and much compressed at the 
bottom. This puts the greatest ease of control in the range of most frequent use; there is very 
little point in giving a fader precise control over signals at 260 dB.  
 Figure 13.16a shows the straightforward construction used in smaller and less expensive 
mixers. There is some end resistance Ref at the bottom of the resistive track which 
compromises the offness, and it is further compromised by the voltage-drop down the 
resistance R g of the ground wire that connects the fader to the channel PCB. To fix this a 
so-called ‘infinity-off’ feature is incorporated into the more sophisticated faders.  
 Figure 13.16 b shows an infinity-off fader. When the slider is pulled down to the bottom of 
its travel, it leaves the resistive track and lands on an end-section with a separate connection 
back to the channel module ground. No signal passes down this ground wire and so there 
is no voltage-drop along its length. This arrangement gives extremely good maximum

out over the upper part of the travel

attenuation, orders of magnitude better than the simple fader, though of course ‘infinity’ is 
always a tricky thing to claim. 
 Faders are sometimes fitted with fader-start switches; these are microswitches which are 
actuated when the slider moves from the ‘off’ position. Traditionally these started tape 
cartridge machines; now they may be used to trigger digital replay. 
 Active volume controls 
 Active volume controls have many advantages. As explained in the section on preamplifier 
architectures, the use of an active volume control removes the dilemma concerning how much 
gain to put in front of the volume control and how much to put after it. An active gain control 
must fulfil the following requirements: 
1.  The gain must be smoothly variable from a maximum, usually well above unity, down to 
effectively zero, which in the case of a volume control means at least 270 dB. This at once 
rules out series-feedback amplifier configurations as these cannot give a gain of less than 
one, unless combined with a following passive control. Since the use of shunt feedback 
implies a phase-inversion, this can cause problems with the preservation of absolute polarity. 
2.  The control law relating shaft rotation and gain should be a reasonable approximation to a 
logarithmic law. It does not need to be strictly linear-in-decibels over its whole range; this 
would give too much space to the high-attenuation end, say around 260 dB, and it is better 
Figure 13.16: A simple fader a) and a more sophisticated version at b) with an ‘inﬁ nity off’ 
section to maximise offness

356 Chapter 13
to spread out the middle range of 220 to 250 dB, where the control will normally be used. 
These figures are naturally approximate as they depend on the gain of the power amplifier, 
speaker sensitivity, and so on. A major benefit of active gain controls is that they give much 
more flexible opportunities for modifying the law of a linear pot than does the simple addition 
of a loading resistor, which was examined and found somewhat wanting earlier in this chapter. 
3.  The opportunity to improve channel balance over the mediocre performance given by 
the average log pot should be firmly grasped. Most active gain controls use linear pots 
and arrange the circuitry so that these give a quasi-logarithmic law. This approach can be 
configured to remove channel imbalances due to the uncertainties of dual-slope log pots. 
4.  The noise gain of each amplifier involved should be as low as possible. 
5.  As for passive volume controls, the circuit resistance values should be as low as 
practicable to minimise Johnson noise and capacitive crosstalk.  
   Figure 13.17   shows a collection of possible active volume configurations, together with their gain 
equations. Each amplifier block represents an inverting stage with a large gain 2A, i.e. enough 
to give plenty of negative feedback at all gain settings. It can be regarded as an opamp with its 
non-inverting input grounded. Figure 13.17a simply uses the series resistance of a log pot to set 
the gain. While you get the noise/headroom benefits of an active volume control, the retention of 
a log pot with its two slopes and resulting extra tolerances means that the channel balance is no 
better than that of an ordinary passive volume control using a log pot. It may in fact be worse, for 
the passive volume control is truly a potentiometer, and if it is lightly loaded differences in track 
resistance due to process variations should at least partially cancel, and one can at least rely on 
the gain being exactly 0 dB at full volume. Here, however, the pot is actually acting as a variable 
resistance, so variations in its track resistance compared with the fixed R1 will cause imbalance; 
the left and right gain will not even be the same with the control fully up. Given that pot track 
resistances are usually subject to a ±20% tolerance, it would be possible for the left and right 
channel gains to be 4 dB different at full volume. This configuration is not recommended. 
 Figure 13.17b improves on Figure 13.17a by using a linear pot and attempting to make 
it quasi-logarithmic by putting the pot into both the input and feedback arms around the 
amplifier. It is assumed that a maximum gain of 20 dB is required; it is unlikely that a 
preamplifier design will require more than that. The result is the law shown in  Figure 13.18 , 
which can be seen to approximate fairly closely to a linear-in decibels line with a range of 
224 to 120 5 44 dB. This is a result of the essentially square-law operation of the circuit, in 
which the numerator of the gain equation increases as the denominator increases. This is in 
contrast to the loaded linear pot case described earlier, which approximates to a 20 dB line.  
 The deviation of the control law from the 44 dB line is plotted in  Figure 13.19 , where it can 
be seen that between control rotations of 0.1 and 1, and a gain range of almost 40 dB, the 
maximum error is ±2.5 dB. This sort of deviation from an ideal law is not very noticeable in 

Figure 13.17: Active volume control conﬁ gurations

Figure 13.18: The control law of the active volume control in Figure 13.17b

Volume controls 359
practice. A more serious issue is the way the gain heads rapidly south at rotations less than 
0.1, with the result that volume drops rapidly towards the bottom of the travel, making it 
more difficult to set low volumes to be where you want them. Variations in track resistance 
tend to cancel out for middle volume settings, but at full volume the gain is once more 
proportional to the track resistance and therefore subject to large tolerances.  
 The configuration in Figure 13.17c also puts the pot into an input arm and a feedback arm, but 
in this case in separate amplifiers; the feedback arm of A1 and the input arm of A2. It requires 
two amplifier stages, but as a result the output signal is in the correct phase. When configured 
with R 5 10 kΩ, R1 5 10 kΩ, R3 5 1 kΩ, and R4 510 kΩ, it gives exactly the same law as 
Figure 13.17b, with the same maximum error of ±2.5 dB. It therefore may seem as pointless extra 
complication, but in fact the extra resistors involved give a greater degree of design freedom. 
 In some cases a linear-in decibels line with a range of 44 dB, which is given by the active 
gain stages already looked at, is considered too rapid; less steep laws can be obtained from a 
modified version of Figure 13.17c, by adding another resistor R2 to give the arrangement in 
Figure 13.17d. This configuration was used in the famous Cambridge Audio P50 integrated 
amplifier, introduced in 1970. When R2 is very high, the law approximates to that of 
Figure 13.17c. With R2 reduced to 4 kΩ, the law is modified to Trace 2 in  Figure 13.20 ; the 
law is shifted up, but in fact the slope is not much altered, and is not a good approximation to 
Figure 13.20: The control law of the active volume control in Figure 13.17d

360 Chapter 13
the ideal 30 dB log line, labelled ‘30’. When R2 is reduced to 1 kΩ, the law is as Trace 3 in 
Figure 13.17d, and is a reasonable fit to the ideal 20 dB log line, labelled ‘20’. Unfortunately 
varying R2 can do nothing to help the way that all the laws fall off a cliff below a control 
rotation of 0.1, and in addition the problem remains that the gain is determined by the ratio 
between fixed resistors, for which a tolerance of 1% is normal, and the pot track resistance, 
with its ±20% tolerance. For this reason, none of the active gain controls considered so far are 
going to help with channel balance problems.  
 The Baxandall active volume control 
 The active volume control configuration in Figure 13.17e is due to Peter Baxandall. Like so 
many of the innovations conceived by that great man, it authoritatively solves the problem 
it addresses [1].   Figure 13.21 shows the law obtained with a maximum gain of 120 dB; the 
best-fit ideal log line is now 43 dB. There is still a rapid fall-off at low control settings. 
 You will note that there are no resistor or track resistance values in the gain equation in 
Figure 13.17e; the gain is only a function of the pot rotation and the maximum gain set up 
by R1, R2. As a result quite ordinary dual linear pots can give very good channel matching. 
Figure 13.21: The control law of the 120 dB Baxandall active volume control in Figure 13.17e

Volume controls 361
When I tried a number of RadioOhm 20 mm diameter linear pots, the balance was almost 
always within 0.3 dB over a 46 dB gain range, with occasional excursions to an error of 0.6 dB. 
 However, the one problem that the Baxandall configuration cannot solve is channel 
imbalance due to mechanical deviation between the wiper positions. I have only once 
found that the Baxandall configuration did not greatly improve channel balance; in that 
case the linear pots I tried, which came from the same Chinese source as the log pots that 
were provoking customer irritation, had such poor mechanical alignment that the balance 
improvement obtained was small, and not worth the extra circuitry.  
 Note that all the active gain configurations require a low-impedance drive if they are to give 
the designed gain range; don’t try feeding them from, say, the wiper of a balance control 
pot. The Baxandall configuration inherently gives a phase inversion that can be highly 
inconvenient if you are concerned to preserve absolute phase, but this can be undone by an 
inverting tone-control stage, such as the, er, Baxandall type. 
 An important point is that while at a first glance the Baxandall configuration looks like a 
conventional shunt feedback control, its action is modified by the limited gain set by R1 and 
R2. This means that the input impedance of the stage falls as the volume setting is increased, 
but does  not drop to zero. With the values shown in  Figure 13.23 , input impedance falls 
steadily from a maximum of 10 kΩ at zero gain, to a minimum of 1.27 kΩ at maximum 
gain. If the preceding stage is based on a 5532 it will have no trouble driving this. Another 
consequence of the gain of the A2 stage is that the signals handled by the buffer A1 are never 
very large. This means that R1, and consequently R2, can be kept low in value to reduce 
noise without placing an excessive load on the buffer. 
 All the active volume controls examined here, including the otherwise superior Baxandall 
configuration, give a gain law that falls very rapidly in the bottom tenth of control rotation. It 
is not easy to see that there is any cure for this apart from using switched resistors instead of 
pots; any law can then be achieved. 
 The Baxandall volume control law 
 While the Baxandall configuration has several advantages, it is not perfect. One disadvantage 
is that the gain/rotation law is determined solely by the maximum gain, and it is not possible 
to bend it about by adding resistors without losing the freedom from pot-value-dependence.  
 Figure 13.22 shows the control laws for different maximum gains. Pot rotation is described 
here as Marks from Mk 0 to Mk 10 for full rotation. No provision is made for rock bands 
seeking controls going up to Mk 11 [2]. Changing the maximum gain has a much smaller 
effect on the gain at the middle setting (Mk 5). 
 Very often a maximum gain of 110 dB is required in preamplifier design, giving us 24 dB 
with the volume control central. In this case the control law is rather flat, with only 14 dB 

362 Chapter 13
change of gain in the top half of control rotation. The 110 dB law approximates closely to a 
linear-in-decibels line with a range of 218 to 110 5 28 dB. This has a shallower slope than 
the 43 dB log line shown in  Figure 13.21 , and is not ideal for a volume control law. Things 
can be much improved by combining it with a linear law; more on this later. 
 A practical Baxandall active volume stage 
 I have designed several preamplifiers using a Baxandall active volume control [3], [4], 
[5], [6]. The practical circuitry I employed for [4] is shown in  Figure 13.23 ; this includes 
DC-blocking arrangements to deal with the significant bias currents of the 5532 opamp. The 
maximum gain is set to 117 dB by the ratio of R1, R2, to amplify a 150 mV line input to 1 V 
with a small safety margin.  
 This active volume-control stage gives the usual advantages of lower noise at gain settings 
below maximum, and excellent channel balance that depends solely on the mechanical 
alignment of the dual linear pot – all mismatches of its electrical characteristics are cancelled 
out. Note that in the first two preamplifier designs referenced here, all the pots were identical 
at 10 kΩ linear, apart from the question of centre-detents, which are desirable only on the 
balance, and treble and bass boost/cut controls. 
 The values given here are as used in the Precision Preamplifier ‘96 [4]. Compared with 
[3], noise has been reduced slightly by an impedance reduction on the gain-definition

network R1, R2. The limit on this is the ability of buffer U1:B to drive R1, which has 
a virtual-earth at its other end. C3 ensures HF stability if there are excess phase-shifts 
due to stray capacitance. C1 prevents any DC voltages from circuitry upstream from 
reaching the volume-control stage. The input bias current of U1:B will produce a small 
voltage drop across R3, and C2 prevents this from reaching the control pot. Since two 
terminals of the pot are DC-blocked, it is now permissible to connect the third terminal 
to the output of U1:A as no current can flow through the control. The offset voltage at the 
output of U1:B will be amplified by U1:A, but should still be much too small to have any 
significant effect on available voltage swing, and it is prevented from leaving this stage 
by DC-blocking capacitor C4. R4 is a drain resistor to prevent voltage building up on the 
output due to leakage through C4, and R5 ensures stability by isolating the stage from load 
capacitance downstream, such as might be caused by the use of screened cable. Note that 
R4 is connected before R5, to prevent any loss of gain. The amount of loss is of course very 
small in one stage, but it can build up irritatingly in a large system if this precaution is not 
observed.  Table 13.3 gives the noise performance. 
 The figure at full volume may look a bit mediocre, but results from the use of 117 dB of 
gain; at normal volume settings the noise output is well below 2100 dBu.

 Low-noise Baxandall active volume stages 
 One of the themes of this book is the use of multiple opamps to reduce noise, exploiting the 
fact that noise from uncorrelated sources partially cancels. The Baxandall volume stage lends 
itself very well to this technique, which is demonstrated in   Figure 13.24 . The first version 
at a) improves on the basic design in  Figure 13.23 by using two inverting amplifiers instead 
of one, and reducing the value of the pot from 10 kΩ to 5 kΩ. Bear in mind that the latter 
change reduces the input impedance proportionally, and it can fall to low values (1.2 kΩ in 
this case) with the volume control at maximum. The outputs of the two inverting amplifiers 
are averaged by the 10 Ω resistors R4 and R7, and the noise from them partially cancels. The 
noise from the unity-gain buffer U1:A is not reduced because it is reproduced identically 
by the two inverting amplifiers. C1 and R1 prevent the input bias current of the buffer from 
flowing through the pot wiper and causing rustling noises. This volume control stage was 
used in the variable-frequency-tone-control preamplifier published in Jan Didden’s  Linear 
Audio , Volume 5 [5]. 
 Note that in Figure 13.24a there is a spare opamp section floating in space. If this is not 
required elsewhere in the signal path, pressing it into use as another inverting amplifier will 
usually give more noise reduction than doubling-up the buffer.

buffer, dual inverting amps and 5 kΩ pot, b) quad buffer, quad inverting amps and 1 kΩ pot.

 Figure 13.24b shows a more sophisticated design for still lower noise, using four inverting 
amplifiers and four separate buffers. There is nothing to be gained by averaging the buffer 
outputs before applying the signal to the inverting amplifiers, as the partial cancellation 
of buffer noise is carried out later by the 10 Ω resistors R103, etc. just as for the inverting 
amplifier noise. Four inverting amplifiers have enough drive capability to make it feasible to 
reduce the volume pot right down to 1 kΩ for lower noise without any distortion problems. 
DC-blocking components were not deemed to be required at the buffer inputs, because 
the bias currents are flowing through low resistances. This stage was used in my Elektor 
Preamplifier 2012 design [6], and, as for all the stages in this preamplifier, a really serious 
attempt was made to make the noise as low as was reasonably practical. There are no great 
technical difficulties in using an even lower pot value, such as 500 Ω, but there are sourcing 
problems with dual gang pots of less than 1 kΩ.  
 The measured noise performance for a single–inverting amplifier stage ( Figure 13.23 with 
maximum gain reduced to 110 dB) and the stages in  Figure 13.24 are summarised in  Table 13.4 . 
While the reduction in noise on adding amplifiers is not perhaps very dramatic, it is as bullet-
proof as any electronic procedure can be. 
 The Baxandall volume control: loading effects 
 With circuits like the Baxandall volume stage that are not wholly obvious in their operation, 
it pays to keep a wary eye on all the loading conditions. We will take the dual amplifier

volume control stage Figure 13.24a as an example. There are three loading conditions to 
consider: 
 Firstly, the input impedance of the stage. This varies from the whole pot track resistance at Mk 0, 
to a fraction of this at Mk10, that fraction being determined by the maximum gain of the stage. It 
falls proportionally with control rotation as the volume setting is increased.  Figure 13.25 shows 
how the minimum input impedance becomes a smaller proportion of the track resistance as the 
maximum gain increases. With a maximum gain of 110 dB the minimum input impedance is 
0.23 times the track resistance, which for a 5 kΩ pot gives 1.2 kΩ. If the preceding stage is based 
on a 5532 or an LM4562 it will have no trouble at all in driving this load.  
 Secondly, the loading on the buffer stage U1:A. A consequence of the gain of the two 
inverting amplifiers U1:B, U2:A stage is that the signals handled by the unity-gain buffer 
U1:A are never very large; less than 3 Vrms if output clipping is avoided. This means that R2, 
R3 and R5, R6 can all be kept low in value to reduce noise without placing an excessive load 
on unity-gain buffer U1:A, which would cause increased distortion at high levels. 
 Thirdly, the loading on the inverting stages U1:B, U2:A. At Mk 10 the loading is a substantial 
fraction of the value of the pot, but it gets heavier as volume is reduced, as demonstrated in the 
rightmost column of  Table 13.5 . We note thankfully that the loading stays at a reasonable level 
over the mid-volume settings. Only when we get down to a setting of Mk 1 does the load get 
down to a slightly worrying 383 Ω; however, at this setting the attenuation is 221.6 dB, so even a 
maximum input of 10 Vrms would only give an output of 830 mV. We also have two opamps

resistance falls more rapidly when the stage is conﬁ gured for higher maximum gains

in parallel to drive the load, so the opamp output currents are actually quite small. Note that the 
loading considered here is only that of the pot on the inverting stages. The inverting opamps also 
have to drive their own feedback resistors R3 and R6, which are effectively grounded at the other 
end, and this should be taken into account when working out the total loading. U1:B, U2:A also 
have to drive whatever load is connected to the volume control stage output; it is likely to be the 
final stage in the preamplifier and may be connected directly to the outside world. 
Table 13.5 shows the gain and the noise output at the various control settings.
 I haven’t bothered to fill in all the entries for input impedance, as it simply changes 
proportionally with control setting as seen in  Figure 13.25 , ranging from the minimum of 
1162 Ω to 5 kΩ, the resistance of the pot track. 
 Going back to the loading on the inverting opamps at low volume, we have 383 Ω at Mk 1, 
which is 766 Ω per opamp and no cause for alarm. However, I have heard doubts expressed 
about a possible rise in distortion at very low volume settings below this, because the 
inverting amplifiers U1:B, U2:A then see even lower load impedances. The impedances may 
be low, but the current to be absorbed by the inverting stages is actually very limited because 
almost the whole of the pot track is in series with the input at low settings. To prove there is 
not a problem here, I set the volume to Mk 1 and pumped 20 Vrms in, getting 1.6 Vrms out. 
The THD residual was indistinguishable from the GenMon output of the AP SYS-2702. In 
use the input cannot exceed 10 Vrms as it comes from an opamp. 
 To push things further, I set the volume to Mk 0.2, (i.e. only 2% off the endstop) and shoved 
20 Vrms in to get only 300 mVrms out. The THD1N residual was 0.0007%, composed

entirely of noise with no trace of distortion. I then replaced the 4562s in the U1:B, U2:A 
positions with Texas 5532s (often considered the worst make for distortion) and the results 
were just the same except the noise level was a bit higher giving a THD1N of 0.0008%. 
There is not a problem here. 
 Baxandall active volume stage plus passive control 
 One of the few disadvantages of the Baxandall volume control is that, unlike passive 
volume controls, the noise output is not absolutely zero when the volume is set to zero. 
Whatever the configuration, at least the voltage noise of the opamps will appear at the output. 
This limitation applies to all active volume controls. The only other real drawback of the 
Baxandall control is the control law, which as we saw earlier, is rather too flat over its upper 
and middle ranges when configured for the popular maximum gain of 110 dB. The law 
cannot be bent around directly without introducing pot-dependence. 
 Both of these problems can be solved by putting a passive linear volume control after the 
active volume stage, with the two pots ganged together. This obviously means a four-gang 
control but the benefits are worth it. The noise level is now really zero at Mk 0 because the 
wiper of the linear pot is connected to ground. 
 Furthermore, the combination of the linear law with that of the Baxandall control gives a steeper 
characteristic which approximates to a linear-in-decibels line with a range of 232 to 110 5 42 dB, 
which is much more usable than the 28 dB line of the Baxandall control alone (see  Figure 13.26 ). 
 This arrangement is also free from pot-dependence, so the gain depends only on the angular 
setting of the ganged control. However, this will no longer hold if the wiper of the linear 
pot is significantly loaded. In practice a high-input-impedance buffer stage will be required, 
and this compromises the ‘zero-noise at zero volume’ property. On the other hand, a unity-
gain buffer opamp is working in good conditions for low noise, having no feedback resistors 
to introduce Johnson noise or convert opamp current noise to voltage noise. The source 
impedance for the buffer is usually non-zero, as it is fed from the wiper of the linear pot, but 
this can be made low in value as the multiple inverting amplifiers in the Baxandall stage give 
plenty of drive capability. The linear pot does not have to be directly after the active volume 
control; intermediate stages could be inserted if required, giving a distributed volume control. 
 A practical version of this arrangement is shown in  Figure 13.27 , where both pots are 2 kΩ. 
Making them different in value would introduce some unwelcome complications in 
component sourcing, but such a custom component could be specified if there was a powerful 
reason to do so (which, as far as I can see, there isn’t). 
 In this case a 3-path Baxandall control is used, which has in itself an intermediate noise 
performance between the 2-path and 4-path versions in  Table 13.5 above. The only downside 
to this technique is the expense of the four-gang pot.

 Potentiometers and DC 
 As noted in the previous section, it is never a good idea to have DC flowing through any part 
of a potentiometer. If there is a DC voltage between the ends of the pot track there will be 
rustling noises generated as the wiper moves up and down over minor irregularities in track 
resistance. 
 Feeding a bias current through a wiper to the next stage tends to create more serious noise 
because the variations in wiper contact resistance are greater. This tends to get worse as the 
track surface becomes worn. This practice is often acceptable for FET input opamps like the 
TL072 but it is definitely not a good idea for bipolar opamps such as the 5532 because the 
bias current is much greater and so therefore is the noise on wiper movement. AC coupling 
is essential when using bipolar opamps. If you are using electrolytic capacitors then make 
sure that the coupling time-constant is long enough for capacitor distortion to be avoided 
(see  Chapter 2 ). 
 Motorised potentiometers 
 Motorised pots are simply ordinary pots driven by an attached electric motor, heavily geared 
down and connected to the control shaft through a silicone slipping clutch. This clutch allows 
manual adjustment of the volume when the motor is off, and prevents the motor stalling when 
the pot hits the end of its travel; limit switches are not normally used. Motorised pots are now 
considerably cheaper than they used to be, due to the manufacture of components in China 
that represent a very sincere homage to designs by ALPS and others, and they appear in lower 
to middle-range integrated amplifiers. Motorisation can be added to any control that uses a 
rotary pot. 
 In many ways they are the ideal way to implement a remote-controlled volume function. 
There is no variable gain electronics to add noise and distortion, manual control is always 
available if you can’t find the remote (so-called because it is never to hand) and the volume 
setting is inherently non-volatile, as the knob stays where it was left when you switch off. 
 A disadvantage is that the ‘feel’ of a motorised pot is pretty certain to be worse than a normal 
control, because of the need for the slipping clutch between the control shaft and the motor; 
a large diameter weighted knob helps with this. The channel balance is, of course, no better 
than if the same pot was used as a manual control. 
 Since the motor has to be able to run in either direction, and it is simplest to run it from 
a single supply, an H-bridge configuration (as shown in  Figure 13.28 ) is used to drive it. 
Normally all four transistors are off. To run the motor in one direction Q1 and Q4 are turned 
on; to run in the other direction Q2 and Q3 are turned on. The H-bridge and associated logic 
to interface with a microcontroller can be obtained in convenient ICs such as the BA6218 

Volume controls 371
by Rohm. This IC can supply an output current of up to 700 mA. Two logic inputs allow 
four output modes: forward, reverse, idle (all H-bridge transistors off) and dynamic braking 
(motor shorted via ground). The logic section prevents input combinations that would turn on 
all four devices in the H-bridge and create (briefly) electronic mayhem.  
 The absence of limit switches means that if continuous rotation is commanded (for example, 
by sitting on the remote) there is the potential for the motor to overheat. It is a wise 
precaution to write the software so that the motor is never energised for longer than it takes to 
get from one extreme of rotation to the other, plus a suitable safety margin. 
 It would appear that there might be problems with electrical noise from the motor getting into 
the audio circuitry, but I have not myself found this to be a problem. In the usual version the 
motor is screened with a layer of what appears to be GOSS (grain-oriented silicon steel) to 
keep magnetic effects under control, and the motor terminals are a long way from the audio 
terminals. A 100 nF capacitor across the motor terminals, and as close to them as practicable, 
is always a good idea. The motor should be driven from a separate non-audio supply unless 
you’re really looking for trouble; motorised controls with 5 V motors are popular as they can 
run off the same 15 V rail as a housekeeping microcontroller. I have never had problems 
with motor noise interfering with a microcontroller. 
 Linear faders, as used on mixing consoles, are also sometimes motorised, not for remote 
control, but to allow previously stored fader movements to be played back in an automatic 
mixdown system. A linear servo track next to the audio track allows accurate positioning of 
the fader. Motorisation has usually been done by adding a small electric motor to one end 
of the fader, and moving the control knob through a mechanism of string and pulleys that is

strongly reminiscent of an old radio dial. Such arrangements have not always been as reliable 
as one might have hoped. 
 Stepped volume controls 
 The great feature of potentiometer-based volume controls is that they have effectively 
infinite resolution, so you can set exactly the level you require. If, however, you are prepared 
to forego this and accept a volume control that changes in steps, a good number of new 
possibilities open up and, in return, promise much greater law accuracy and channel balance. 
The technologies available include rotary-switched resistive attenuators, relay-switched 
resistive attenuators, switched multi-tap transformers, and specialised volume-control ICs. 
These options are examined below. 
 The obvious question is: how small a step is needed to give satisfactory control? If the steps 
are made small enough, say less than 0.2 dB, they are imperceptible (always providing there 
are no switching transients) but there are powerful economic reasons for not using more 
steps than necessary. 2 dB steps are widely considered acceptable for in-car entertainment 
(implemented by an IC) but my view is that serious hifi requires 1 dB steps. 
 Switched attenuator volume controls 
 For high-end products where the imperfections of a ganged-potentiometer volume control 
are not acceptable, much superior accuracy can be achieved by using switched attenuators to 
control level. It is well-known that the BBC for many years used rotary faders that were stud-
switched attenuators working in 2 dB steps; some of these were still in use in 1961. 
 The normal practice is to have a large rotary switch that selects a tap on a resistor ladder; 
since the ladder can be made of 1% tolerance components the channel matching is much 
better than that of the common dual-gang pot. A stereo control naturally requires two resistor 
ladders and a two-pole switch. The snag is of course the much greater cost; this depends to 
a large extent on how many control steps are used. The resistor ladders are not too costly, 
unless exotic super-precision parts are used, but two-pole switches with many ways are 
neither cheap nor easy to obtain. 
 At the time of writing, one commercial preamp offers twelve 5 dB steps; the component 
cost has been kept down by using separate switches for left and right channels, which is not 
exactly a triumph of ergonomics. Another commercial product has an 11-position ganged 
switched attenuator. In my opinion neither offers anything like enough steps. 
 The largest switches readily available are made up from 1 pole 12-way wafers. The most 
common version has a break-before-make action, but this causes clicky transients due to the 

Volume controls 373
interruption of the audio waveform. Make-before-break versions can usually be obtained 
and these are much more satisfactory as the level changes as the switch is rotated are very much 
smaller and the transients correspondingly less obtrusive. Make sure no circuitry gets overloaded 
when the switch is bridging two contacts. 
 Moving beyond 12-way, a relatively popular component for this sort of thing is a 24-position 
switch from the ELMA 04 range. A bit of care is needed in selecting the part required as one 
version has 10 μm of silver on the contacts with a protective layer of only 0.2 μm thick gold. 
This very thin layer is for protection during storage and transport only and in use will wear 
off quite quickly, exposing the silver, which is then subject to tarnishing and the production 
of non-conductive silver sulphide; this version should be avoided unless used in a sealed 
environment. Other versions of these switches have thick 3 μm gold on the contacts which 
is much more satisfactory. They can be obtained with one, two or four 24-way wafers, but 
they are not cheap. At the time of writing the first edition of this book (January 2009), two-
wafer versions were being advertised by third parties at about $130 each, which meant that 
in almost all cases the volume switch would cost a lot more than the rest of the preamplifier 
put together. 
 If 24 positions are not enough (which in my view is the case) 48-way switches are available 
from ELMA and Seiden, though in practice they have to be operated as 47-way because the 
mechanical stop takes up one position. This stop is essential, as a sudden transition from 
silence to maximum volume is rarely a good idea. 58-way switches are also available from 
Seiden. 
 A switched attenuator can be made very low-impedance to minimise its own Johnson 
noise and the effect of the current noise of the following stage. The limiting factors 
are that the attenuator input must present a load that can be driven with low distortion 
from the preceding stage, and that the resistor values at the bottom of the ladder do 
not become too small for convenience. An impedance of around 1000 Ω from top to 
bottom is a reasonable choice. This means that the highest output impedance, (which is 
at the 26 dB setting, a very high setting for a volume control) will be only 250 Ω. This 
has a Johnson noise of only 2128.2 dBu (22 kHz bandwidth, 25 °C), and is unlikely 
to contribute much to the noise output of a system. The choice of around 1000 Ω does 
assume that your chosen range of resistors goes down to 1 Ω rather than stopping at 
10 Ω, though if necessary the lower values can of course be obtained by paralleling 
resistors.  
 Assuming you want to use a 12-way switch, a possible approach is to use 12 steps of 4 dB 
each, covering the range 0 to 244 dB. My view is that such steps are too large, and 2 dB is 
much more usable, but you may not want to spend a fortune on a rotary switch with more 
ways. In fact, 1 dB steps are really required so you can always get exactly the volume you 
want, but implementing this with a single rotary switch is going to be very difficult, as it 

374 Chapter 13
implies something like a 60- or 70-way switch. My current preamplifier just happens to be a 
relay-switched Cambridge Audio 840E with some 90-odd 1 dB steps. 
 There is no reason why the steps have to be equal in size, and it could be argued that the steps 
should be smaller around the centre of the range and larger at the top and bottom, to give 
more resolution where the volume control is most likely to be used. It does not really matter 
if the steps are not exactly equal – the vital thing is that they should be identical for the left 
and right channels to avoid image shift. 
 Figure 13.29a shows a typical switched attenuator of this sort, with theoretically exact 
resistor values; the size of each step is 4.00000 dB, accurate to five decimal places. In view 
of resistor tolerances, such accuracy may appear pretty pointless, apart from the warm feeling 
it produces, but it costs nothing to start off with more accuracy than you need. The total 
resistance of the ladder is 1057 Ω, which is a very reasonable load on a preceding stage, so 
long as it is implemented with a 5532, LM4562, or similar. 
Figure 13.29: A 12-way switched attenuator volume control: a) gives the theoretical resistor 
values, b) is the best accuracy with E24 resistor values, and c) shows how the step errors are much 
reduced by using E96 values

Volume controls 375
 A lot depends on what range of resistor values you have access to. When I began to design 
preamplifiers, E12 resistors (12 values per decade) were the norm, and E24 resistors 
(24 values per decade) were rather rare and expensive. This is no longer the case, and E24 
is freely available. Figure 13.29b shows the same attenuator with the nearest E24 value 
used for each resistor. The attenuation at each tap is still very accurate, the error never 
exceeding 0.12 dB except for the last tap which is 0.25 dB high; this could be cured by 
making R12 a parallel combination of 6.8 Ω and 330 Ω and making R11 3.9 Ω, which 
reduces the last-tap error to 0.08 dB. To reduce the effect of tolerances R12 would be 
better made from two near-equal components; 12 Ω in parallel with 15 Ω is only 0.060% 
high in value. 
 The next most prolific resistor range is E96, with no less than 96 values in a decade – nobody 
seems interested in making an E48 range as such, though it is of course just a sub-set of 
E96. Using the nearest E96 value in the attenuator, we get Figure 13.29c, where the taps 
are accurate to within 0.04 dB; remember that this assumes that each resistor is exactly the 
value it should be and does not incorporate any tolerances. The improvement in accuracy is 
not enormous, and if you can get a tighter tolerance in the E24 range than E96, E24 is the 
preferred option. 
 There is also an E192 resistor range, but it is rather rare, and there seems to be no pressing 
need to use so many different values in volume control attenuators. 
 Almost all the work in the design of a switched attenuator is the calculation of the resistor 
values in the ladder. Putting in likely component values and attempting to tweak them by 
hand is a most unpromising approach, because all the values interact and you will boil off 
your sanity. A systematic spreadsheet approach is the only way. This is probably the simplest: 
1.  Decide the approximate total resistance of the resistor ladder. 
2.  Decide the step size, say 4 dB. 
3.  Take a two resistor potential divider, where the sum of the resistors equals the desired 
total resistance, and choose exact values for a 4 dB attenuation; use the goal-seek tool to 
get the exact value for the bottom resistor (an exact E24 value at the top of the ladder is 
not essential, but it is convenient). 
4.  Now split the bottom resistor into two, so that another 4 dB attenuator results. Check that 
the attenuation really is correct, because an error will propagate through the rest of the 
process, and you will have to go back and do it all again from that point. Repeat this step 
until you have enough resistors in the ladder for the number of taps required. 
5.  When the table of resistor values is complete, pick the nearest value for each resistor 
from the E-series you are using. Alternatively select a parallel pair to get closer to the 
desired value, keeping the two resistors as near-equal as possible. 

376 Chapter 13
 You will then have constructed something like the spreadsheet shown in  Table 13.6 , which 
gives the E24 resistor values shown in Figure 13.29b. The chosen value at the top of the 
ladder is 390 Ω. The spreadsheet has been set up to give more information than just the 
resistor value and the tap attenuation; it gives the voltage at each tap for a given input (10 V 
in this case) in column 5, the output impedance of each tap in column 6, the step size in dB

in column 8, and the absolute error for each tap in column 9. It also gives the total resistance 
of the ladder, the current through it for the specified input voltage, and the resulting power 
dissipation in each resistor in column 7. The last parameter is unlikely to be a major concern 
in an audio attenuator, but if you’re working with very low impedances to minimise noise, it 
is worth keeping an eye on. 
 Before the design work begins you must consider the stages before and after the attenuator. It 
is strongly recommended that the attenuator input is driven from a very low impedance such 
as the output of an opamp with plenty of negative feedback, so the source impedance can be 
effectively considered as zero and does not enter into the calculations. The loading on the 
output of the attenuator is more of a problem. You can either take loading on the output into 
account in the calculations, in which case the shunting effect of the load must be incorporated 
into step 3 above, or else make the input impedance of the next stage so high that it has a 
negligible effect. 
 As an example, the E24 network in Figure 13.29b was calculated with no allowance for 
loading on the output. Its highest output impedance is 253 Ω at Tap 3, so this is the worst 
case for both loading-sensitivity and noise. If a load of 100 kΩ is added, the level at this tap 
is only pulled down by 0.022 dB. A 100 kΩ input impedance for a following stage is easy to 
arrange, so the extra computation required in allowing for loading is probably not worthwhile 
unless for some very good reason the loading is much heavier. The Johnson noise of 253 Ω is 
still only 2128.2 dBu. 
 If you feel you can afford 24-way switches, then there is rather more flexibility in design. You 
could cover from 0 to 246 dB in 2 dB steps, 0 to 257.5 dB in 2.5 dB steps, or 0 to 269 dB 
in 3 dB steps. There are infinite possibilities for adopting varying step sizes. 
 Table 13.7 shows the resistor values for 0 to 246 dB in 2 dB steps,  Table 13.8 gives 
those for 0 to 257.5 dB in 2.5 dB steps, and  Table 13.9 gives the values for 0 to 269 dB 
in 3 dB steps. All three tables give the nearest E24 and E96 values, and the resulting 
errors. Note the first two versions start off with a 220 Ω resistor at the top, but on moving 
from 2 dB to 2.5 dB steps, the resistors towards the bottom naturally get smaller to 
give the greater attenuation required, and the total ladder resistance falls from 1060 Ω 
to 866 Ω. To prevent the resistor values becoming inconveniently small and the total 
resistance too low, the 3 dB step version starts off with a higher value resistor of 430 Ω 
at the top; this increases the total resistance of the ladder to 1470 Ω, and raises the 
maximum output impedance to 368 Ω at Tap 3. The Johnson noise of 368 Ω is naturally 
higher at 2126.5 dBu, but this is still very low compared with the likely noise from 
amplifier stages downstream. 
 The exact values on the left hand of each table can be scaled to give the total divider 
resistance required, but it will then be necessary to select the nearest E24 or E96 value

 If the available switches do not give enough steps, a possible solution is to use two rotary 
switches; one for coarse volume control, and the other for vernier control, the latter perhaps 
in 1 dB steps or less. While straightforward to design, this is not exactly user-friendly. A 
buffer stage is usually desirable to prevent the second attenuator from loading the first one; 
the second attenuator may present a constant load, but it is a heavy one. With no buffer, the

total loading of the two attenuators could also present an excessive load to the stage before 
the first attenuator. 
 A rotary switch does not of course have the smooth feel of a good potentiometer. To mitigate 
this, a switched volume control may need a large-diameter weighted knob, possibly with some 
sort of silicone damping. Sharp detents and a small knob do not a good volume control make. 

Volume controls 381
 Relay-switched volume controls 
 If you need more steps than a switch can provide, it is relatively simple to come up with 
a system that emulates a rotary switch with as many steps as desired, using relays, a 
microcontroller and an inexpensive shaft encoder; you will need a relay for each step and that 
will be an awful lot of relays. Another approach is to use relays in a ladder attenuator, which 
greatly reduces the relay count. As soon as a microcontroller is introduced, then there is of 
course the possibility of infra-red remote control.  
 The design of a ladder attenuator relay volume control is not all as simple as it may appear. 
If you try to use a binary system, perhaps based on an R–2R network, you will quickly 
find that horrible transients erupt on moving from, say, 011111 to 100000. This is because 
relays have an operating time that is both long by perceptual standards and somewhat 
unpredictable. It is necessary to use logarithmic resistor networks with some quite subtle 
relay timing. 
 Currently the highest expression of this technology is the Cambridge Audio 840A Integrated 
amplifier and 840E preamplifier. The latter has second generation dual-path relay volume 
control technology and uses  only 12 relays to give 1 dB steps over most of the range. 
A rather unexpected feature of relay volume controls is that having purchased a very 
sophisticated preamplifier, where the precision relay control is the major unique feature, 
some customers then object to the sound of the relays clicking inside the box when they 
adjust the volume setting. You just can’t please some people. 
 Transformer-tap volume controls 
 There are other ways of controlling volume than with resistors. At the time of writing 
(2013) there is at least one passive preamplifier on the market that controls volume by 
changing the taps on the secondary of a transformer. The unit I have in mind has only 
12 volume steps, apparently each of 4 dB. These are very coarse steps for a volume control 
– unacceptably so, I would have thought; a 48 dB range also seems too small. 24-way 
switches are available (see the section on switched attenuator volume controls above) but 
they are expensive. There are several potential problems with this approach – transformers 
are well-known to fall much further short of being an ideal component than most electronic 
parts do. They can introduce frequency response irregularities, LF distortion, and hum. 
They are relatively heavy and expensive, and the need for a large number of taps on the 
secondary puts the price up further. The multi-way switch to select the desired tap must 
also be paid for. 
 There are however some advantages. The output impedance of a resistive potential divider 
varies according to its setting, being at maximum at 26 dB. Assuming it is fed from a low 

382 Chapter 13
impedance, a transformer volume control has a low impedance at every tap, greater than 
zero only by the resistance of the windings, and handily lower than even a low-resistance 
pot. This gives lower Johnson noise and minimises the effect of the current noise of the 
following stage. The much-respected Sowter transformer company make a number of 
different volume-control transformers, of which the most representative is probably the 9335 
model. This is basically a 1:1 transformer with taps on the secondary that give attenuation 
from 0 to 250 dB in 26 steps of 2 dB each. The DC resistance of both primary and 
secondary is 310 Ω. The total resistance of the windings is therefore 620 Ω, which is much 
lower than the value of the volume pots normally used. Note, however, that it is not much 
lower than the 1 kΩ pots I used in the Elektor preamplifier [6]. At the time of writing 9335s 
cost £132 each. You need two for stereo. 
 Integrated circuit volume controls 
 Specialised volume-control ICs based on switched networks have been around for a long 
time, but have only recently reached a level of development where they can be used in 
high-quality audio. Early versions had problems with excessively large volume steps, poor 
distortion performance, and nasty glitching on step changing. The best contemporary ICs are 
greatly improved; a modern example is the PGA2310 from Burr-Brown (Texas Instruments) 
which offers two independent channels with a gain range from 131.5 to 295.5 dB in 0.5 dB 
steps, and is spec’d at 0.0004% THD at 1 kHz for a 3 Vrms input level. The IC includes a 
zero crossing detection function intended to give noise-free level transitions. The concept 
is to change gain settings on a zero crossing of the input signal, and so minimise audible 
glitches. Gain control is by means of a three-wire serial interface, which is normally driven 
by a rotary encoder and a microcontroller such as one of the PIC series. The Yamaha 
YAC523 has a similar specification but incorporates seven gain-controlled channels for AV 
applications. Cirrus Logic make the CS3308 and CS3318, both with 8 channels.
 Loudness controls 
 It is an awkward but inescapable feature of human hearing that its frequency response 
varies with the level of the sound. As the level drops the perceived loudness of high and 
low frequencies falls faster than the middle frequencies. This is very clearly expressed by 
the well-known Fletcher and Munson curves [7] shown in  Figure 13.30 . Their work was 
repeated by Robinson and Dadson [8] whose results are sometimes considered to be more 
accurate, and were the basis for the ISO equal-loudness curves. A great deal of information 
on these curves, the differences between them, and on the whole subject of loudness 
controls, can be found in JAES papers by Newcomb and Young [9], and Holman and 
Kampmann [10].  

Volume controls 383
 The graph shows what sound pressure level above the threshold of hearing is needed to get a 
constant result in phons, the unit of subjective loudness. The first disconcerting feature is that 
none of the curves are remotely flat – at 20 Hz the sensitivity of the ear is always much lower 
than at 1 kHz, no matter what the level. A vital point is that the slopes at the bass end increase 
as the level falls, as shown in Column 2 of  Table 13.10 , which gives the average slope in dB 
per octave between 20 and 100 Hz. At 20 phons the slope is greater than that of a third order 
filter, while at 100 phons it is less than that of a second-order filter. 
 This increase of slope means that if you have satisfactory reproduction at a given sound 
level, turning down the volume gives a subjective loss of bass, demonstrated by the increased 
SPLs required to get the same number of phons at 20 Hz in Column 3. There are also some 
complicated but much smaller variations in the treble (see Column 4). This effect used to be 
called ‘scale distortion’ in the 1950s, which is a less than satisfactory term, not least because 
it sounds as if it would be of interest only to aquarists. At the time there was intense debate 
as to whether attempting to compensate for it – by making the frequency response vary with 
the volume control setting, turning it into what became called a ‘loudness control’ – was the 
right thing to do or not. A switch to make the volume control into a loudness control was 
a common feature in the 1970s, though there was still much debate as to whether it was a 
useful approach, with hifi purists roundly condemning the notion. Loudness controls are

currently out of fashion; if you’re the kind of person that won’t tolerate tone-controls you 
probably regard loudness controls as totally anathema. However, the wheel of fashion turns, 
and it is well worth looking at how they work. 
 Note that we are  not trying to make the Fletcher and Munson curves flat. If we take the 
100 phon level as an example, we would need some 42 dB of boost at 20 Hz, which is clearly 
not right. What we are trying to do is reduce the  differences in perceived bass level with 
volume changes. Let us assume we have a ‘flat’ subjective response at a level of 100 phons, 
which since it roughly corresponds to 100 dB SPL which is pretty loud, typically described 
as ‘a jackhammer at 1 metre’.  Figure 13.31 shows the correction response we would need to 
bring the lower levels into line with the 100 phons curve. This was obtained by subtracting 
the 100 phon data from that for the other levels. The curves look a little wobbly as they 
cannot be read from the graph in  Figure 13.30 with accuracy much better than 1 dB. 
 Clearly the correction shown above 1 kHz is neither large nor consistent. Holman and 
Kampmann state clearly that above 400 Hz correction is neither ‘necessary or desirable’ 
[11]. Correction below 1 kHz, however, is a different matter. Fortunately it consists of 
monotonic curves, though they do have varying slopes. For the higher levels, the hinge 
point between sloping and flat is around 600 Hz, increasing as the level falls to about 
1 kHz. The slope, averaged between 20 Hz and 1 kHz, varies between 0.5 dB/octave at 
90 phons to 7.3 dB/octave at 10 phons. If we assume that 10 phons is too low a level to 
worry about, we find the 20-phons correction curve has a slope of only 5.8 dB, which 
promises that we could implement a compensation network with simple first-order 
circuitry.

 The Fletcher and Munson curves depend on the absolute level at the ear, and this obviously 
depends on amplifier gain, loudspeaker efficiency, room acoustics and many other factors. 
Unless you set up your system for a defined SPL which you regard as ‘flat’, loudness 
compensation is going to be a rather approximate business, and this is one argument 
frequently advanced against it. 
 Switchable loudness facilities were fitted to a large number of Japanese amplifiers in the 
1970s and 80s, but European and USA manufacturers rarely used them. The circuitry used 
was virtually standard, with three typical versions shown in  Figure 13.32 . With the loudness 
switch set to ‘OUT’ the capacitors do nothing and we have a linear pot loaded down at its 
tap by R1, to approximate a logarithmic volume law (I assume that the pot must be linear; 
Japanese service manuals seem remarkably coy about the law of the pot, and only in one case 
have I found it confirmed as linear). When the loudness switch is set to ‘IN’, C1 gives HF 
boost and C2 gives LF boost by reducing the loading effect of R1.

pot rotation is from Marks 0–10, curve 0 not shown
 The simulated frequency response for the Denon circuit is shown in  Figure 13.33 . There are 
three notable features: first, there is a lot of boost applied at HF, despite the fact that, as we 
saw above, no HF correction is actually wanted. Second, the correction curves only change 
in shape over the top half of the control rotation, the response being fixed below that. Third, 
there is a rather dramatic change in mid-band level between Marks 5 and 6, as the pot wiper 
approaches the centre-tap. 

Volume controls 387
 The almost universal inclusion of HF boost in these loudness circuits is a bit of a mystery. I 
can only assume that people took a quick look at the Fletcher and Munson curves, and saw 
increases at the HF end, but did not notice that the curves are essentially equally spaced, 
not varying in shape with level. I wonder if this unwanted HF boost was one of the reasons 
why loudness controls were so poorly regarded; in their heyday, the primary source was 
vinyl, with bad distortion characteristics at HF. It seems likely that the HF boost would have 
accentuated this. 
 A few other loudness schemes were used. The Sansui A60 and A80 amplifiers had separate 
loudness and volume pots. Newcomb and Young [9] put forward a very ingenious active 
control that compensated at LF only. 
 These loudness controls must represent the widest ever use of centre-tapped pots, which are 
otherwise rarely encountered. Pioneer used a centre-tapped pot with a simple loading resistor 
to ground connected to the tap, to emulate a logarithmic law; there was no loudness facility 
(see the Pioneer A-88X and the A-77X (1985)).

 Balance controls 
 The ideal balance law 
 The job of a balance control on a preamplifier is to adjust the relative gain of the left and right 
channels, and so alter the position of the stereo image to the left or right, and do nothing else 
at all. As you would expect, increasing the left gain moves things to the left, and vice versa. 
The ideal law is therefore that of a stereo panpot in a mixing console. Two uncorrelated sound 
sources (and any signal will be uncorrelated once it has left the loudspeakers and bounced 
around the room a bit) add just like white noise sources, and so give a combined signal that 
is 3 dB higher, and not 6 dB higher. The sine/cosine panpot law in  Figure 14.1 is therefore 
appropriate for the balance control of a stereo signal, because the level of the combined 
signals will not alter as the image is moved across the stereo stage from one side to the other 
(see panpots in  Chapter 22 ). It is a constant-volume balance control. 
 I am aware I said, in the First Edition of this book, that the panpot law was  not the ideal 
balance law, so let me clarify that. The sine/cosine law is functionally ideal in terms of its 
operation, but is not optimal in terms of electrical performance. Since the gain is 3 dB 
at the central position, there will be some compromise. If the 3 dB loss is made up by gain 
before the balance control, the headroom is reduced by 3 dB. If the loss is made up with 
3 dB of gain after the balance control, the noise performance is likely to suffer. The only way 
to avoid this is to use an active balance control, which alters the gain of a stage rather than 
passively introducing attenuation. 
 A panpot in a mixing console reduces one of the signals to zero at each extreme of the pot 
rotation. There is no need to do this in a preamplifier. A balance control does not have to 
make radical changes to signal level to do its job. Introducing a channel gain imbalance of 
10 dB is quite enough to shift the sound image completely to one side, so it appears to be 
coming from one loudspeaker only, and there is nothing at all to be gained by having the 
ability to fade out one channel completely. 
 This means that the ideal balance control is not a mixer panpot as such, but a panpot 
effectively limited in its rotation so that neither endstop is reached and the signal is never 
reduced to zero. This might be called a truncated sine/cosine law. An example is shown in 

390 Chapter 14
 Figure 14.2 , where the 20% of the control travel at each end is not used, and the central 
60% spread out to give more precise control. As a result the maximum attenuation, with the 
balance control hard over, is 10.4 dB, while the minimum attenuation is 0.41 dB. The 
attenuation at the centre is unchanged at 3.0 dB; a central detent on a balance control pot is 
highly desirable. 
 In the case of a switched balance control, this is equivalent to using a 23-way switch (there 
must be an odd number to give a central position) and treating it as a 37-way switch, with the 
extreme seven positions at each end inaccessible. This gives a greater number of steps over 
the range in which the control is actually used. 
 Since the balance control is usually a set-and-forget function that does not require 
readjustment unless the listening room is rearranged, it is not often considered when controls 
are being motorised. In fact, getting the balance exactly right by leaping up and down 
between sofa and preamplifier is rather more tiresome than manual adjustment of volume. 
 If we look at the issue purely from the point of electrical performance rather than 
functionality, and ignore the desirability of a constant-volume balance control, the ideal 
balance law would have no attenuation when set centrally, and when moved to left or right 
 Figure 14.1 : The sine/cosine law for a constant-volume stereo balance control 

Balance controls 391
will attenuate only one channel without affecting the gain of the other. This can be done with 
special balance pots that are available from several manufacturers. If there  is attenuation at 
the central position then it needs to be made up by extra amplification either before or after 
the balance control, and this means that either the overload margin or the noise performance 
will be compromised to some degree. As noted earlier, the only way to avoid this is to use an 
active balance control, which alters gain rather than attenuation. 
 Balance controls: passive 
 Figure 14.3 shows the various forms of passive balance control; only the right channel 
is shown in the first three cases. Anti-clockwise movement of the control is required 
to introduce attenuation into the right channel and shift the sound image to the left. In 
Figure 14.3a a simple pot is used. If this has a linear track it will give a 6 dB loss when set 
centrally, and when the two uncorrelated stereo channels are rms-summed, there will be a 
3 dB drop in the centre as the control is moved from hard left to hard right. See  Figure 14.4 , 
where no truncation of the balance law is used. This is a long way from being an ideal 
constant-volume balance control. An extra 6 dB of gain has to be built into the system to 
 Figure 14.2 : A truncated sine/cosine law for a constant-volume stereo balance control 

392 Chapter 14
counteract the central loss, and the noise/headroom compromise is undesirable. If a log law is 
used for one channel, and an anti-log law for the other, the central loss can be made smaller, 
say 3 dB or less. Such dual-slope pots are not noted for their accuracy, so the uncertainties 
of log-law tolerancing mean it will not be possible to guarantee that the channel gains are 
identical when the control is centralised. 
 Special balance pots, as shown at Figure 14.3b, have half of each track, including the central 
position, made of a low resistance material, so that neither channel is attenuated at the central 
setting. On moving the control clockwise the right channel wiper stays on the low-resistance 
section and gain stays at 0 dB, while the left wiper moves onto the normal log/anti-log section 
and the signal is attenuated. Since there is no central attenuation the combined signal level 
falls off at each side; this is not a constant-volume balance control. 
 The linear control in Figure 14.3a can be much improved by the addition of a pull-up resistor, 
as in Figure 14.3c, which reduces the attenuation at the central position. With a 10 kΩ pot, a 
3.6 kΩ pull-up resistor gives a central drop of very close to 3.0 dB, making the balance law 
approximately constant-volume. 
 Figure 14.3:  Passive balance controls 

Balance controls 393
 The result is seen in  Figure 14.5 ; we have the right combined volume at the centre, but 
the volume is up to 0.35 dB low elsewhere. This is not likely to be perceptible under any 
circumstances, and we have very simply created what is for all but the most demanding 
applications a constant-volume balance control. 
 We can make things even better by reducing the pull-up resistor to 3.0 kΩ, which spreads 
the volume error out over both sides of the 0 dB line, reducing the worst case volume error 
to 0.25 dB, as in  Figure 14.6 . You might think this improvement is mere pedantry, but if it is 
possible to make things work slightly better simply by changing a resistor value, I can think 
of no reason not to do it. 
 More information on what is essentially a panpot configuration can be found in  Chapter 22 , 
though there the emphasis is more on constant volume when panning a mono signal to stereo. 
 The economical method in Figure 14.3d was once popular as only a single pot section is 
required. Unfortunately it has the unavoidable drawback that the relatively high resistance 
between wiper and track causes serious degradation of the interchannel crosstalk performance. 
If the resistance values are reduced to lower Johnson noise, the track-wiper resistance is

deviation from constant-volume to 0.25 dB 

Balance controls 395
unlikely to decrease proportionally and the crosstalk will be worsened. With the values shown, 
the loss for each channel with the control central is 3.2 dB. This loss can be reduced by 
decreasing the value of R1, R2 with respect to the pot, but this puts a correspondingly heavier 
load on the preceding stages when the control is well away from central. 
 Some preamplifier designs have attempted to evade the whole balance control problem by 
having separate but concentric volume knobs for left and right channels. The difficulty here is 
that almost all the time only the volume will require adjustment, and the balance function will 
be rarely used; it is therefore highly desirable that the left and right knobs are linked together 
in some sort of high-friction way so that the two normally move together. This introduces 
some awkward mechanical complications. 
 Balance controls: active 
 An active balance control is configured so that it makes a small adjustment to the gain of 
each channel rather than introducing attenuation, so that any noise/headroom compromise 
can be avoided altogether. Since all active preamplifiers have at least one gain stage, the 
extra complication is likely to be minimal. It is not elegant to add an extra active stage just to 
implement the balance function. 
 Figure 14.7a shows an active balance control that requires only a single-gang pot. However, it 
suffers from the same serious disadvantage as the passive version in Figure 14.3d; the wiper 
connection acts as a common impedance in the two channels and causes crosstalk. This kind 
of balance control cannot completely fade out one channel as it is not possible to reduce the 
stage gain below unity; in fact even unity cannot be achieved with this configuration because 
whatever the setting, there is some resistance to ground making up the lower feedback arm. 
 Figure 14.7 : Active balance controls 

396 Chapter 14
With the values shown the gain for each channel with the control central is 6.0 dB. With 
the control fully clockwise the gain increases to 9.4 dB, and decreases to 4.4 dB with it 
fully anti-clockwise; the range is deliberately quite restricted. It is a characteristic of this 
arrangement that the gain increase on one channel is greater than the decrease on the other. 
 Combining balance controls with other stages 
 The balance control function is a very simple one; just control attenuation or gain over a 
rather limited range. I have always felt it is inelegant and uneconomic to design into a system 
a stage that does that and nothing else. 
 My earliest attempts in this direction were to combine the balance control with a Baxandall 
tone control, the balance pot varying the amount of output signal fed to the NFB side of the 
Baxandall network, with provision for minimising the source impedance variations. This 
worked quite well but did not give laboratory-instrument accuracy for the tone-control curves. 
 More recently I have found it expedient to combine the balance control with a balanced 
(differential) line input amplifier. It is a pity that there are two different uses of the word 
‘balanced’ in the same circuit block, but there’s not much that can be done about it except 
to call it a ‘differential input’ which is less common in audio usage. There is more on this 
combination later in this chapter, and in  Chapter 18 on line inputs. 
 Figure 14.7b shows an active balance control combined with an active gain control and mono/
stereo switching. This configuration was used in the original Cambridge Audio P-series 
amplifiers; in that application A1 was a simple two-transistor inverting stage and A2 an 
even simpler single transistor. The left-hand section of volume control RV1 is the feedback 
resistance for A1, while the right hand section forms part of the input resistance to shunt stage 
A2, both changing to give a quasi-logarithmic law when the control is altered. The balance 
control RV2 is a variable resistance in the shunt feedback network of A2. The mono/stereo 
switch feeds the virtual-earth node of A2 with both channels via R3, R4 when in mono mode. 
The circuit has two inverting stages and so handily maintains the absolute phase of the output. 
 Switched balance controls 
 A balance control implemented with a pot is subject to inaccuracy due to the loose 
tolerances of the pot track (20%) compared with the fixed resistors around it. This does not 
apply to the arrangements in Figure 14.3a and Figure 14.3b because here the pot is acting as 
a pure potentiometer, with its output determined only by the wiper position (this assumes that 
the next stage puts negligible loading on the pot). If Figure 14.3a has a linear track to avoid 
the inaccuracies of log and anti-log tracks, there is an excessive 6 dB loss when set centrally. 
The accuracy of the control in Figure 14.3b depends on whether the resistive (non-metal) 
part of the track is linear or log. 

Balance controls 397
 A switched balance control, like a switched volume control, offers more than enough 
accuracy for even very precise audio work, and allows complete freedom in selecting the 
control law. As for volume controls, the drawbacks are much increased cost and a limited 
number of control steps. The latter is less of an issue for a balance control as it can have far 
fewer steps and still give all the control resolution for image position that is required. As 
with switched volume controls, the cost of the switch increases steeply with the number of 
steps. I suggest 24 steps are enough for a truly world-class balance control, and such switches 
are readily available. One of the switch positions must correspond to the central setting, 
so we actually need an odd number of switch positions. The 24-way switch is therefore 
mechanically stopped down to 23 positions, with position 12 being the centre. The switch 
should be make-before-break to minimise glitching. 
 Table 14.1 shows a truncated-sine law, as described above; the maximum attenuation at each 
extreme is 10 dB. This is shown implemented in   Figure 14.8 .

 Mono-stereo switches 
 It was once commonplace for preamplifiers to have mono-stereo switches, which allowed 
a mono source to be played over both channels of a stereo amplifier system. Some of these 
were configured so that the two channels were simply joined together somewhere in the 
middle of the preamp stages, which was not very satisfactory unless the unused input was 
terminated in a low impedance to minimise noise. More sophisticated versions allowed either 
the left or the right input only to be routed to both outputs. 
 Since all modern sources are at least stereo, mono-stereo switches are now rarely if ever fitted. 
 Width controls 
 Another facility which has always been rare in preamps but is now almost unheard-of is the width 
control. Summing a small proportion of each channel into the other reduces the width of the sound 
image, and this was sometimes advocated as a small width reduction would make the image less 
associated with the loudspeakers, and so give a stronger illusion of acoustic reality. This of course 
 Figure 14.8 : A 23-step passive constant-volume switched balance control, with make-before-
break wiper contact 

Balance controls 399
runs directly counter to more contemporary views that very high levels of interchannel isolation 
are required to give a good stereo image. The latter is flat-out untrue; it was established long 
ago by the BBC in extensive testing before the introduction of stereo broadcasting, that a stereo 
separation of 20 to 25 dB is enough to give the impression of full image width. 
 By cross-feeding antiphase signals, the width of a stereo image can be increased. A famous 
circuit published by Mullard back in 1972 [1] gave continuous variation between mono, 
normal, and enhanced-width stereo. It was stated that antiphase crossfeed of greater than 
24% should not be used as it would cause the sound image to come apart into two halves. 
 Figure 14.9 shows an up-to-date version that I have used in many mixing console designs, 
usually on stereo input modules. 
 With the control central, the stereo width is unaltered, as the cross-feed through R2 and R3 
is grounded via the centre-taps of the pot tracks. If there were no centre-taps we would be 
relying on the limited mechanical accuracy of the dual pot to minimise the crossfeed, and 
this would not work well. With the pot fully anti-clockwise 100% of each channel is summed 
with the other, giving mono. With the pot fully clockwise a fraction of each channel is 
summed with the other in anti-phase, increasing stereo width.

 Tone controls and equalisers 
 Introduction 
 Facilities that alter the shape of the frequency response are called tone controls when they are 
incorporated in hifi systems, and equalisation (or EQ) in mixing consoles. 
 Tone controls have suffered at the hands of fashion for some years now. It has been claimed 
that tone-controls cause an audible deterioration even when set to the flat position. This is 
usually blamed on ‘phase-shift’. For a long time tone controls on a preamp damaged its 
chances of street (or rather sitting-room) credibility, for no good reason. A tone-control set 
to ‘flat’ – assuming it really is flat – cannot possibly contribute any extra phase-shift unless 
you have accidentally built in an allpass filter, which would require truly surreal levels of 
incompetence. Even if you managed to do it, it would still be inaudible except possibly on 
artificial test signals such as isolated clicks. This is well-known; most loudspeaker crossovers 
have an all-pass phase response, and this is considered entirely acceptable. A tone-control set 
to flat really is inaudible. 
 My view is that hifi tone controls are absolutely indispensable for correcting room acoustics, 
loudspeaker shortcomings, or the tonal balance of the source material, and that a lot of people 
are suffering sub-optimal sound as a result of this fashion. It is commonplace for audio 
critics to suggest that frequency-response inadequacies should be corrected by changing 
loudspeakers; this is an extraordinarily expensive way of avoiding tone-controls. 
 The equalisation sections of mixers have a rather different function, being creative rather than 
corrective (from now on I am going to just call it EQ). The aim is to produce a particular sound, 
and to this end mixer EQ is much more sophisticated than that found on most hifi preamplifiers. 
There will be middle controls as well as bass and treble (which in the mixing world are more 
often called LF and HF) and these introduce a peak or dip into the middle range of the audio 
band. On more complex consoles the middle frequencies are infinitely variable, and the most 
advanced examples have variable Q as well, to control the width of the peak or dip introduced. 
No one has so far suggested that mixing consoles should be built without EQ. 
 It is not necessary to litter these pages with equations to determine centre frequencies and so on. 
In each case, altering the range of frequency controlled can be done very simply by scaling the 

402 Chapter 15
capacitor values given. If a stage gives a peaking cut/boost at 1 kHz, but you want 2.5 kHz, then 
simply reduce the values of all the capacitors by a factor of 2.5 times. Scaling the associated 
resistors instead would give the same frequency response, but may also affect noise performance, 
because if the resistor values are raised, Johnson noise will increase. Distortion will increase if 
reducing the resistor values places excessive loading on the opamps used. Another consideration 
is that potentiometers come in a very limited number of values, usually multiples of one, two, 
and five. Changing the capacitors is simpler and much more likely to be trouble-free. 
 Passive tone controls 
 For many years all tone controls were passive, simply providing frequency-selective 
attenuation. The famous  Radio Designer’s Handbook [1] shows that they came in a bewildering 
variety of forms; take a look at the chapter on ‘Tone compensation and tone control’ which 
is 42 pages long with 90 references, but does not include the Baxandall tone control. That is 
hidden away in an appendix at the back of the book (the final edition was published in 1953 but 
modern reprints are available). Some of the circuits are incredibly complex, requiring multi-
section switches and tapped inductors to give quite limited tone control possibilities.  Figure 15.1  
shows one of the simpler arrangements [2] which is probably the best-known passive tone 
control configuration. It was described by Sterling [3]. though I have no idea if he originally 
invented it. The arrangement gives about ±18 dB of treble and bass boost and cut, the curves 
looking something like those of a Baxandall control but with less symmetry.  
 Such circuitry has several disadvantages. When set to flat it gives a loss in each network of 
20.8 dB, which means a serious compromise in either noise (if the make-up gain is after the 
Figure 15.1: A pre-Baxandall passive tone control, with severe limitations

Tone controls and equalisers 403
tone-control network) or headroom (if the make-up gain is before the tone-control network). 
In the days of valves, when these networks were popular, headroom may have been less 
of a problem, but given the generally poor linearity of valve circuitry, the increased levels 
probably gave rise to significantly more distortion. 
 Another problem is that if linear pots are used, the flat position corresponds to one-tenth of the 
rotation. It is therefore necessary to use log pots to get the flat setting to somewhere near the 
centre of control travel, and their large tolerances in law and value mean that the flat position 
is actually rather variable, and is unlikely to be the same for the two channels of stereo. 
 This circuit counts as a passive tone control because the valve in the middle of it is simply 
providing make-up gain for the treble network and is not in a frequency dependent feedback 
loop. In the published circuit there was another identical valve stage immediately after the 
bass network to make up the losses therein. There are some other interesting points about this 
valve-based circuit; it runs at a much higher impedance than solid-state versions, using 2 MΩ 
pots rather than 10 kΩ, and it uses a single supply rail at an intimidating 300 Volts. Circuitry 
running at such high impedances is very susceptible to capacitive hum pickup. There will also 
be a lot of Johnson noise from the high-value resistors. 
 Baxandall tone controls 
 The Baxandall bass-and-treble tone control swept all other versions before it. The original 
design, famously published in  Wireless World in 1952 [4] was, in fact, rather more complex 
than the simplified version which has become universal. Naturally at that date it used a valve 
as the active component. The original schematic is rarely if ever displayed, so there it is in 
 Figure 15.2. THD was quoted as less than 0.1% at 4 Vrms out up to 5 kHz.  
 The 1952 circuit specified a centre-tapped treble pot to give minimum interaction between 
the two controls, but such specialised components are almost as unwelcome to manufacturers 
as they are to home constructors, and the form of the circuit that became popular is shown 
in  Figure 15.3 , some control interaction being regarded as acceptable. The advantages of 
this circuit are its simplicity and its feedback operation, the latter meaning that there are no 
awkward compromises between noise and headroom, as there are in the passive circuit above. 
It also gives symmetrical cut and boost curves and is easily controlled. 
 It is not commonly realised that the Baxandall tone control comes in several versions. Either 
one or two capacitors can be used to define the bass time-constants, and the two arrangements 
give rather different results at the bass end. The same applies to the treble control. The 
original Baxandall design used two capacitors for bass and one for treble. 
 In the descriptions that follow, I have used the term ‘break frequency’ to indicate where the 
tone control begins to take action. I have defined this as the frequency where the response is 
±1 dB away from flat with maximum cut or boost applied.

Figure 15.4: Bass control frequency responses. The effect of the LF control above the ‘hinge-
point’ at 1 kHz is very small
 The Baxandall one-LF-capacitor tone control 
 This is probably the most common form of the Baxandall tone control used today, simply 
because it saves a capacitor or two. The circuit is shown in  Figure 15.3 . At high frequencies the 
impedance of C1 is small and the bass control RV1 is effectively shorted out and R1, R2 give 
unity gain. At low frequencies RV1 is active and controls the gain, ultimately over a ±16 dB 
range at very low frequencies. R1, R2 are end-stop resistors which set the maximum boost or cut. 
 At high frequencies again, C2 has a low impedance and treble control RV2 is active, 
with maximum boost or cut set by end-stop resistor R4; at low frequencies C2 has a high 
impedance and so RV2 has no effect. Resistor R3 is chosen to minimise interaction between 
the controls. The HF network can also be configured with two capacitors, with has some 
advantages; more on that later.  
 The one-LF-capacitor version is distinguished by its fixed LF break frequency, as shown by 
the bass control response in  Figure 15.4. The treble control response in  Figure 15.5 is similar. 
 In these figures the control travel is in eleven equal steps of a linear pot (central plus five 
steps on each side). The bass curves are ±1.0 dB at 845 Hz, while the treble curves are 
±1.0 dB at 294 Hz. This sort of overlap is normal with the Baxandall configuration. Phase 

406 Chapter 15
spikes are shown at input and output to underline that this stage phase-inverts, which can be 
inconvenient; phase spikes will be seen in most of the diagrams that follow in this chapter. 
 An HF stabilising capacitor C3 is shown connected around A1. This is sometimes required to 
ensure HF stability at all control settings, depending on how much stray capacitance there is 
in the physical layout to introduce extra phase shifts. The value required is best determined 
by experiment. This capacitor is not shown in most of the diagrams that follow, to keep them 
as uncluttered as possible, but the likely need for it should not be forgotten.  
 It is important to remember that the input impedance of this circuit varies both with 
frequency and control settings, and it can fall to rather low values.  
 Taking the circuit values shown in  Figure 15.2 , the input impedance varies with 
frequency as shown in  Figure 15.6 , for treble (HF) control settings, and as  Figure 15.7  
for bass (LF) control settings. With both controls central the input impedance below 
100 Hz is 2.9 kΩ. At low frequencies C1, C2 have no effect and the input impedance 
is therefore half the LF pot resistance plus the 1k8 end-stop resistor, adding up to 
6.8 kΩ. In parallel is 5 kΩ, half the impedance of the HF pot, as although this has no 
direct connection to the summing point (C2 being effectively open-circuit), its other end 
Figure 15.5: Treble control frequency responses

Figure 15.6: Input impedance variation with frequency, for eleven treble control settings
Figure 15.7: Input impedance variation with frequency, for eleven bass control settings

408 Chapter 15
is connected to the output which is the input inverted. Hence the centre of the pot is 
approximately at virtual-earth. The parallel combination of 6.8 kΩ and 5 kΩ is 2.9 kΩ, 
and so this is the input impedance at LF.  
 At frequencies above 100 Hz (still with both controls central) the input impedance falls 
because C1 is now low impedance and the LF pot is shorted out. The input impedance is now 
1.8 kΩ in parallel with 5 kΩ, which is 1.3 kΩ. This is already a significant loading on the 
previous stage, and we haven’t applied boost or cut yet. 
 When the HF control is moved from its central position, with the LF control central, the HF 
impedance is higher at full cut at 2.2 kΩ. It is however much lower at 350 Ω at full boost. 
There are very few opamps that can give full output into such a low impedance, but this is not 
quite as serious a problem as at first appears. The input impedances are only low when the 
circuit is boosting; therefore driving the input at the full rail capability is not relevant, for if 
you do the output will clip long before the stage driving it. Nonetheless, opamps such as the 
5532 will show increased distortion driving too heavy a load, even if the level is a long way 
below clipping, so it is a point to watch. 
 The input impedances can of course be raised by scaling the impedance of the whole circuit. 
For example, multiply all resistor values by four, and quarter the capacitor values to keep 
the frequency response the same. The downside to this is that you have doubled the Johnson 
noise from the resistors, and quadrupled the effect of opamp current noise, and so made the 
stage noisier. 
 When the LF control is moved from its central position, with the HF control central, the input 
impedance variations are similar, as shown in  Figure 15.7. At full LF cut the input impedance 
is increased to 5.0 kΩ; at full LF boost it falls to 770 Ω at low frequencies. This variation 
begins below 1 kHz, but is only fully established below 100 Hz. 
 The figure of 770 Ω requires some explanation. The incoming signal encounters a 1k8 
resistor, in parallel with 5 kΩ which represents half of the HF pot resistance, if we assume 
that its wiper is at virtual earth. The value of this is 1.32 kΩ; so how on earth can the input 
impedance fall as low as 770 Ω? The answer is that our assumption is wrong. The HF pot 
wiper is  not at virtual earth; it has a signal on it only 7 dB less than at the output and this is 
in phase with the output; in other words, in anti-phase with the input. This causes ‘reverse 
bootstrapping’ of the 5 kΩ resistance that is half of the HF pot, and makes it appear lower 
in value than it is. A similar ‘reverse bootstrapping’ effect occurs at the cold input of the 
standard differential amplifier balanced input stage (see  Chapter 18 ). 
 At low frequencies, more of the input current is actually going into the HF section of the 
tone-control network than into the LF section. This highlights one of the few disadvantages of 
the Baxandall type of tone-control – the input impedances are reduced by parts of the circuit 
that are not actually doing anything useful at the frequency of interest. Other versions of the 

Tone controls and equalisers 409
tone-control network have a somewhat better behaviour in this respect, and this is examined 
further on in this chapter. 
 These input impedances also appear as loading on the output of the opamp in the tone-
control stage, when the control settings are reversed. Thus at full LF boost there is a 770 Ω 
load on the preceding stage, but at full LF cut that 770 Ω loading is on the tone-control 
opamp. 
 The Baxandall two-LF-capacitor tone control 
 The two-capacitor version of the Baxandall tone control is shown in  Figure 15.8 , and while 
it looks very similar there is a big difference in the LF end response curves, as seen in   Figure 
15.9. The LF break frequency rises as the amount of cut or boost is increased. It is my view 
that this works much better in a hifi system, as it allows small amounts of bass boost to be 
used to correct loudspeaker deficiencies without affecting the whole of the bass region. In 
contrast, the one-capacitor version seems to be more popular in mixing consoles, where the 
emphasis is on creation rather than correction. 
 The other response difference is the increased amount of ‘overshoot’ in the frequency 
response (nothing to do with overshoot in the time domain).  Figure 15.9 shows how the use 
of LF boost causes a small amount of cut just above 1 kHz, and LF cut causes a similar boost. 
The amounts are small and this is not normally considered to be a problem. 
 Note that the treble control here has been configured slightly differently, and there are now 
two end-stop resistors, at each end of the pot, rather than one attached to the wiper; the 
frequency response is identical, but the input impedance at HF is usefully increased.  
Figure 15.8: The two-LF-capacitor Baxandall tone control

410 Chapter 15
 The input impedance of this version shows variations similar to the one-capacitor version. 
With controls central, at LF the input impedance is 3.2 kΩ; from 100 Hz to 1 kHz it slowly 
falls to 1.4 kΩ. The changes with HF and LF control settings are similar to the one-C version, 
and at HF the impedance falls to 370 Ω. 
 The Baxandall two-HF-capacitor tone control 
 The treble control can also be implemented with two capacitors, as in  Figure 15.10.  
 The frequency responses are similar to those of one-HF-capacitor version, but as for the 
LF control, some ‘overshoot’ in the curves is introduced. There is a useful reduction in the 
loading presented to the preceding stage. With controls central, at LF the input impedance is 
6.8 kΩ, which is usefully higher than the 2.9 kΩ given by the 1-HF capacitor circuit; from 
100 Hz to 1 kHz it slowly falls to 1.4 kΩ.  
 When the LF control is varied, at full cut the input impedance is increased to 11.7 kΩ, and 
at full boost it falls to 1.9 kΩ; see  Figure 15.11. On varying the HF control, at full cut the

HF-capacitor version

412 Chapter 15
input impedance is increased to 2.3 kΩ; at full boost it falls to 420 Ω. These values are higher 
because with this configuration C3, C4 effectively disconnect the HF pot from the circuit at 
low frequencies. In some cases the higher input impedance may justify the cost of an extra 
capacitor. The capacitors will also be about six times larger to obtain the same ±1 dB HF break 
frequency as the one-HF-capacitor version. 
 One disadvantage of the Baxandall tone control is that it inherently phase-inverts. This is 
decidedly awkward, because relatively recently the hifi world has decided that absolute 
phase is important; in the recording world keeping the phase correct has always been a rigid 
requirement. The tone-control inversion can however be conveniently undone by a Baxandall 
active volume control, which also phase-inverts (see  Chapter 13 ). If a balanced input stage is 
used then an unwanted phase inversion can be corrected simply by swapping over the hot and 
cold inputs. 
 A very important point about all of the circuits shown so far is that they assume a FET-input 
opamp (such as the TL072, or a more sophisticated FET part) will be used to minimise the 
bias currents flowing. Therefore all the pots are directly connected to the opamp without any 
explicit provision for preventing DC flowing through them. Excessive DC would make the 
pots scratchy and crackly when they are moved; this does not sound nice. It is, however, long-
established that typical FET bias currents are low enough to prevent such effects in circuits 
like these; however, there is still the matter of offset voltages to be considered. Substituting a 
bipolar opamp such as the 5532 will improve the noise and distortion performance markedly, 
at the expense of the need to make provision for the much greater bias currents by adding 
DC-blocking capacitors .
 The Baxandall tone control: impedance and noise 
 A major theme in this book is the use of low impedance design to reduce Johnson noise from 
resistors and the effects of opamp input current noise flowing in them. Let’s see how that 
works with the Baxandall tone control.  
 The Baxandall controls in  Figure 15.12 all give ±10 dB boost and cut, and are equivalent 
apart from employing 10 kΩ, 5 kΩ, 2 kΩ and 1 kΩ pots, with all other components scaled to 
keep the frequency responses the same. 1 kΩ is the lowest value in which dual-gang pots can 
be readily obtained.  
 Table 15.1 demonstrates that drastically reducing the impedance of the circuit by ten times 
reduces the noise output by 7.0 dB (controls set flat). Using an LM4562 section instead 
of a 5532 section shows a similar progression but with somewhat lower noise levels. The 
improvement on going from 2 kΩ to 1 kΩ pots is small (though reliable) and you may question 
if it is worth pushing things as far as 1 kΩ, given that, as we saw earlier, Baxandall controls 
can show surprisingly low input impedance when boosting, with corresponding heavy loads 

Figure 15.12: Equivalent Baxandall controls giving ±10 dB boost and cut, using 10 k, 5 k, 2 k and 1 k pots

414 Chapter 15
on the opamp driving the negative feedback path when cutting. The situation becomes 
proportionally worse when the impedances are scaled down as we have just done. The design 
process here was driven by a desire to use 1 kΩ pots throughout in the very-low-noise Elektor 
Preamp 2012. [5] 
 In the 1 kΩ case, a 5532 is only able to drive 6.7 Vms (±17 V rails) into the negative feedback 
path before clipping occurs. Clearly we need to either find some way of reducing the loading 
or increasing the drive capability. In the previous section I described how the Baxandall 
configuration with two HF capacitors is easier to drive than the one-capacitor version. 
 Figure 15.12d is shown converted to two-HF-capacitor operation in  Figure 15.13. The 5532 
now clips at 8.8 Vrms, which is much better but the opamp is still overloaded and will not 
give a good distortion performance. Note that the two HF capacitors are both much larger 
than the single HF capacitor in  Figure 15.12d and will be relatively expensive. On the upside 
we get the side-benefit of yet lower output noise – see the bottom row of  Table 15.1.  
 Elsewhere in this book I have described the great advantages of using multiple opamps in 
parallel to drive heavy loads. In this case it is not at all clear how the inverting opamp A1 can

be multiplied in parallel. My solution is to split the drive to the LF and HF control networks 
so that the LF section is driven by its own unity-gain buffer A2 (see  Figure 15.14 ). It is the 
LF section that is driven by the buffer, so that the HF section can be fed directly from A1 and 
will not suffer phase-shift in A2 that might imperil stability. The output now clips at a healthy 
10.8 Vrms, and THD is reduced to the low levels expected.  
 This scheme is to the best of my knowledge novel; it was used for the first time in the Elektor 
2012 preamplifier (using LM4562s) with great success [5]. I call it a Split-Drive Baxandall 
stage. 
 The input side of the control also needs at least two opamps to drive it with low distortion. 
The arrangement here was also used in the Elektor preamp; it makes no assumptions about 
what A3 is up to (it was part of a balanced line input in the preamp) but simply uses A4 as a 
buffer to give separate drive to the input of the LF control network. 
 Switched-HF-frequency Baxandall controls 
 While the Baxandall approach gives about as much flexibility as one could hope for from two 
controls, there is often a need for more. The most obvious elaboration is to make the break 
frequencies variable in some way. 
 The frequency response of the Baxandall configuration is set by its RC time-constants, 
and one obvious way to change the frequencies is to make the capacitors switchable, as in 
an early preamp design of mine [6]. Changing the R part of the RC is far less practical as 
Figure 15.14: Split-drive Baxandall control fed by two parallel opamps and with separate 
feedback drive to the LF and HF control networks

416 Chapter 15
it would require changing the potentiometer values as well. If fully variable frequencies 
controlled by pots are wanted then a different configuration must be used, as described later 
in this chapter. 
 If a large number of switched frequencies (more than three) are wanted then a relatively 
expensive rotary switch is required, but if three will do a centre-off toggle switch will 
certainly take up less panel space, and probably be cheaper; you don’t have to pay for a knob. 
This is illustrated in  Figure 15.15  , where C1 is always in circuit, and either C2 or C3 can 
be switched-in parallel. This is an HF-only tone-control with ±1 dB break frequencies at 
1 kHz, 3 kHz and 5 kHz; most people will find frequencies much higher than that to be a bit 
too subtle. A similar approach can be used with the two-HF-capacitor Baxandall control, but 
twice as much switching is required.  
 A disadvantage of the centre-off switch is that the maximum rather than the middle frequency 
is obtained at the central toggle position. If this is unacceptable then C&K make a switch 
variant (Model 7411) [7] with internal connections that are made in the centre position, so 
that two switch sections will make up a 1-pole 3-way switch as in   Figure 15.16. A stereo 
version is physically a 4-pole switch. This method is naturally more expensive than the 
centre-off approach.  
Figure 15.15: A Baxandall HF-only tone control with three switched turnover frequencies
Figure 15.16: Making a 1-pole 3-way switch with two C&K 7411 switch sections

Tone controls and equalisers 417
 The circuit of  Figure 15.15 also demonstrates how an HF-only tone-control is configured, 
with R2 and R3 taking the place of the LF control, and providing negative feedback at DC 
and LF. If this is combined with an LF-only control, the second phase inversion cancels the 
first and both stages can be bypassed by a tone-cancel switch without a phase change. The 
response is shown in  Figure 15.17.  
 A similar approach can be used to switch the LF capacitor in a Baxandall control. The 
capacitor values tend to be inconveniently large for low break frequencies, especially if you 
are using low-value pots. A different tone control configuration gives more modest sizes – see 
the section ‘Variable-frequency LF EQ’ below. 
 Variable-frequency HF EQ 
 Since we are moving now more into the world of mixing consoles rather than preamplifiers, 
I shall stop using ‘bass’ and ‘treble’ and switch to ‘LF’ and ‘HF’, which of course mean 
the same thing. The circuit shown in  Figure 15.18 gives HF equalisation only, but with a 
continuously variable break frequency, and is used in many mixer designs. It is similar to the 
Baxandall concept in that it uses opamp A1 in a shunt feedback mode so that it can provide 
either cut or boost, but the resemblance ends there.  
Figure 15.17: Frequency response of tone control with three switched HF break frequencies, 
at 1, 3 and 5 kHz

418 Chapter 15
 R1 and R2 set the basic gain of the circuit to 1, and ensure that there is feedback at DC to 
establish the operating conditions; there is no DC path to the non-inverting input of 
A1. When the wiper of RV1 is at the output end, positive feedback partially cancels the 
negative feedback through R2 and the gain increases. When the wiper of RV1 is at the 
input end, the signal fed through A2 causes partial cancellation of the input signal, and gain 
is reduced. 
 The signal tapped off is scaled by divider R3, R4, which set the maximum cut/boost. The 
signal is then buffered by voltage-follower A2, and fed to the frequency-sensitive part 
of the circuit, a high-pass RC network made up of C1 and (R5  RV2). Since only high 
frequencies are passed, this circuit has no effect at LF. The response is shown in   Figure 15.19.   
The frequency-setting control RV2 has a relatively high value at 100 kΩ, because this 
allows for a 16:1 of variation in frequency, and a lower value would give excessive loading 
on A2 at the high frequency end. This assumes TL072 or similar opamps are used to avoid 
the need to deal with opamp input bias currents. If 5532 or LM4562 opamps are used there 
is considerable scope for reduction in the circuit impedances, resulting in lower noise.

400 Hz–6.4 kHz

Tone controls and equalisers 419
 A2 prevents interaction between the amount of cut/boost and the break frequency. Without 
it cut/boost would be less at high frequencies because R5 would load the divider R3, R4. In 
cheaper products this interaction may be acceptable, and A2 could be omitted. In EQ circuitry 
it is the general rule that the price of freedom from control interaction is not eternal vigilance 
but more opamps. The frequency range can be scaled simply by altering the value of C1. The 
range of frequency variation is controlled by the value of end-stop resistor R5, subject to 
restrictions on loading A2 if distortion is to be kept low. 
 The component values given are the E24 values that give the closest approach to ±15 dB cut/
boost at the control extremes. When TL072 opamps are used this circuit is stable as shown, 
assuming the usual supply rail decoupling. If other types are used, a small capacitor (say, 33 pF) 
across R2 may be required. 
 Variable-frequency LF EQ 
 The corresponding variable LF frequency EQ is obtained by swapping the positions of C1 
and R5, RV2 in  Figure 15.18 to give  Figure 15.20. Now only the low frequencies are passed 
through, and so only they are controlled by the boost/cut control. The frequency response is 
shown in  Figure 15.21.  
Figure 15.19: The response of the variable frequency HF shelving circuit at extreme frequency 
settings. Maximum cut/boost is slightly greater than ±15 dB

420 Chapter 15
 A new type of switched-frequency LF EQ 
 In the circuit of  Figure 15.20 , R3 and R4 attenuate the signal before it passes through 
the unity-gain buffer A2. If a very low noise stage is required, it may be possible to put 
the attenuator after the buffer instead, in which case it will attenuate the buffer’s noise by 
Figure 15.20: A variable frequency LF shelving circuit. The ±1 dB break frequency range is 
60 Hz–1 kHz. Boost/cut range of ±15 dB is set by R3 and R4
Figure 15.21: The response of the variable frequency LF shelving circuit at extreme frequency 
settings. Maximum cut/boost is slightly greater than ±15 dB

Tone controls and equalisers 421
7.4 dB. This is easier to do for a switched-frequency rather than a fully variable frequency 
EQ. An example is  Figure 15.22 , which has switched ±1 dB break frequencies at 100 Hz 
and 400 Hz and gives ±10 dB maximal cut and boost. With SW1 open, R3 and R4 
attenuate the signal by the appropriate amount to give ±10 dB. Their combined impedance 
(R3 and R4 in parallel) gives the required 100 Hz frequency in combination with C1. 
When SW1 is closed, R5 is now in parallel with R3 and R6 is in parallel with R4; the 
attenuation is the same but the impedance is reduced so the break frequency increases 
to 400 Hz. 
 At first sight it appears that the relatively high values of R3, R4, R5, R6 would make the 
circuit very noisy. In fact, the large value of C1 means that their noise is largely filtered 
out. In the first version measured R1 and R2 were 4.7 kΩ, and the output noise (flat) was 
109.2 dBu using LM4562 for both opamp sections. Reducing R1, R2 to 2.2 kΩ as shown 
reduced this handily to 111.1 dBu, which is rather quiet. 
Figure 15.22: Low-noise switched-frequency LF EQ with the attenuation after buffer A2

422 Chapter 15
 Variable-frequency HF and LF EQ in one stage 
 In this section I describe how to combine variable frequency LF and HF shelving EQ in one 
stage. This gives some component economy because opamp A1 can be shared between the 
two functions. Despite this the schematic in  Figure 15.23 is a little more complex than you 
might expect from looking at the two circuits above, because this is intended to be premium 
EQ with the following extra features: 
 •  The response returns to unity gain outside the audio band. This is often called return-
to-flat (RTF) operation. The fixed RTF time-constants mean that the boost/cut range is 
necessarily less at the frequency extremes, where the effect of RTF begins to overlap 
the variable boost/cut frequencies. 
 •  The frequency control pots all have a linear law for better accuracy. The required 
logarithmic law is implemented by the electronic circuitry. 
 •  There is an inbuilt tone-cancel switch that does not cause an interruption in the signal 
when it is operated. 
 •  Low-impedance design is used to minimise noise. 
 The boost/cut range is ±10 dB, the LF frequency range is 100 Hz–1 kHz, and the HF frequency 
range is 1 kHz–10 kHz. This design was used in my low-noise preamplifier published in Jan 
Didden’s  Linear Audio in 2012 [8], being developed from an earlier version used in the Precision 
Preamplifier 96 [9]. Very few hifi manufacturers have ever offered this facility. The only one that 
comes to mind is the Yamaha C6 preamp (1980–81) which had LF and HF frequency variable 
by slider over wide ranges (they could even overlap in the 500 Hz–1 kHz range) and Q controls 
for each band as well. The Cello Sound Palette (1992) had a reputation as a sophisticated tone 
control, but it used six boost/cut bands at fixed frequencies that gave much less flexibility [10]. 
 The variable boost/cut and frequencies make the tone-control much more useful for 
correcting speaker deficiencies, allowing any error at the top or bottom end to be corrected to 
at least a first approximation. It makes a major difference. 
 This control was developed for hifi rather than mixer use, and certain features of the tone 
control were aimed at making it more acceptable to those who think any sort of tone-control 
is an Abomination. The control range is restricted to ±10 dB, rather than the ±15 dB which 
is standard in mixing consoles. The response is built entirely from simple 6 dB/octave 
circuitry, with inherently gentle slopes. The stage is naturally minimum-phase, and so the 
amplitude curves uniquely define the phase response. The maximum phase-shift does not 
exceed 40 degrees at full boost, not that it matters because you can’t hear phase-shift anyway. 
 The schematic is shown in  Fig 15.23. The tone-control gives a unity-gain inversion except 
when the selective response of the sidechain paths allow signal through. In the treble and bass 
frequency ranges where the sidechain does pass signal, the boost/cut pots RV1, RV2 can give

control. All pots are 5 kΩ linear

either gain or attenuation. When a wiper is central, there is a null at the middle of the boost/
cut pot, no signal through that sidechain, and the gain is unity. 
 If the pot is set so the sidechain is fed from the input then there is a partial cancellation of the 
forward signal; if the sidechain is fed from the output then there is a partial negative-feedback 
cancellation, or to put it another way, positive feedback is introduced to counteract part of 
the NFB. This apparently ramshackle process actually gives boost/cut curves of perfect 
symmetry. This is purely cosmetic, because you can’t use both sides of the curve at once, so it 
hardly matters if they are exact mirror-images. 
 The tone control stage acts in separate bands for bass and treble, so there are two parallel 
selective paths in the sidechain. These are simple RC time-constants, the bass path being a 
variable-frequency first-order low-pass filter, and the associated bass control only acting on the 
frequencies this lets through. Similarly the treble path is a variable high-pass filter. The filtered 
signals are summed and returned to the main path via the non-inverting input, and some 
attenuation must be introduced to limit cut and boost. Assuming a unity-gain sidechain, this 
loss is 9 dB if cut/boost is to be limited to ±10 dB. This is implemented by R9, R12 and R4. 
The sidechain is unity-gain, and has no problems with clipping before the main path does, so 
it is very desirable to put the loss after the sidechain, where it attenuates sidechain noise. The 
loss attenuator is made up of the lowest value resistors that can be driven without distortion, to 
minimise both the Johnson noise thereof and the effects of the current noise of opamp A1. 
 The Tone Cancel switch disconnects the entire sidechain (5 out of 6 opamps) from any 
contribution to the main path, and usefully reduces the stage output noise by about 4 dB. It 
leaves only A1 in circuit. Unlike configurations where the entire stage is by-passed, the signal 
does  not briefly disappear as the switch moves between two contacts. This minimises transients 
due to suddenly chopping the waveform and makes valid tone in/out comparisons much easier. 
 It is very convenient if all pots are identical. I have used linear 5 kΩ controls, so the 
tolerances inherent in a two-slope approximation to a logarithmic law can be eliminated. 
This only presents problems in the tone stage frequency controls, where linear pots require 
thoughtful circuit design to give the logarithmic action that fits our perceptual processes. 
 In the HF path, C5, R7 is the high-pass time-constant, driven at low-impedance by unity-gain 
buffer A2. This prevents the frequency from altering with the boost/cut setting. The effective 
value of R7 is altered over a 10:1 range by varying the amount of bootstrapping it receives 
from A3, the potential divider effect and the rise in source resistance of RV3 in the centre 
combining to give a reasonable approximation to a logarithmic frequency/rotation law. R8 is 
the frequency endstop resistor that limits the maximum effective value of R7. C2 is the treble 
RTF capacitor – at frequencies above the audio band it shunts all of the sidechain signal to 
ground, preventing the HF control from having any effect. The HF sidechain degrades the 
noise performance of the tone control by 2–3 dB when connected because it passes the HF 
end of the audio band. The noise contribution is greatest when the HF freq is set to minimum, 

Tone controls and equalisers 425
and the widest bandwidth from the HF sidechain contributes to the main path. This is true 
even when the HF boost/cut control is set to flat, as the HF path is still connected to A1. 
 In the LF path, A4 buffers RV1 to prevent boost/frequency interaction. The low-pass time-
constant capacitor is the parallel combination of C11  C12  C13; the use of three capacitors 
increases the accuracy of the total value by √3. The associated resistance is a combination of 
RV4 and R11, R12. C14 and R13 make up the RTF time-constant for the LF path, blocking 
very low frequencies and so limiting the lower extent of LF control action. The bass frequency 
law is made approximately logarithmic by A5; for minimum frequency RV4 is set fully CCW, 
so the input of A5 is the same as the C11 end of R12, which is thus bootstrapped and has no 
effect. When RV4 is fully CW, R11, R12 are effectively in parallel with RV4 and the turnover 
frequency is at a maximum. R11 gives a roughly logarithmic law; its value is carefully chosen 
so that the centre of the frequency range is at the centre of the control travel. Sadly, there is some 
pot-dependence here. The LF path uses three opamps rather than two, but contributes very little 
extra noise to the tone stage, because most of its output is rolled off by the low-pass action of 
C11, C12, C13 at HF, eliminating almost all its noise contribution apart from that of A6. 
 The measured responses for maximum boost and maximum cut at minimum, middle, and 
maximum frequency settings are shown in  Figures 15.24 and  15.25.

maximum frequencies

maximum frequencies
 An important goal in the design of this tone control was low noise. Once the opamps have 
been chosen, and the architecture made sensible in terms of avoiding attenuation-then-
amplification, keeping noise-gain to a minimum, and so on, the remaining way of improving 
noise performance is by low-impedance design. The resistances are lowered in value, with 
capacitances scaled up to suit, by a factor that is limited only by opamp drive capability. 
The 5532 or LM4562 are good for this. A complete evaluation of the noise performance 
is a lengthy business because of the large number of permutations of the controls. If we 
just look at extreme and middle positions for each control, we have maximum boost, flat, 
and maximum cut for both HF and LF, and maximum, middle and minimum for the two 
frequency controls, yielding 3  3  3  3  81 permutations. The measurements given 
in  Table 15.2 are therefore restricted to those that put the greatest demands on the circuitry, 
e.g. HF freq at minimum. 
 Measuring the distortion performance of the tone-control is likewise a protracted affair, 
requiring the exploration of the permutations of the four controls. There were no surprises so 
I will not use up valuable space displaying the results; if there is interest I will put them on 
my website at douglas-self.com. Suffice it to say that THD at 9 Vrms in/out never gets above 
0.001%. General THD levels are in the range 0.0003–0.0007%

 Be aware that circuits like this tone-control can show unexpected input impedance variations. 
A standard Baxandall tone-control made with 10 kΩ pots can have an input impedance that 
falls to 1 kΩ or less at high frequencies where the capacitors have a low impedance. It is not 
obvious but the alternative tone-control configuration used here also shows significant input 
impedance variations. 
 Looking at the circuit in  Figure 15.23 , you might think that because the input terminal 
connects only to a 4k7 resistor and two 5 kΩ pots the input impedance cannot fall below their 
parallel combination i.e. 4k7 i 5k i 5k  1.63 kΩ. You would be wrong; the other end of the 
4k7 resistor is connected to virtual ground, but the two 5 kΩ pots are connected to the stage 
output. When the controls are set flat, or tone-cancel engaged, this carries an inverted version 
of the input signal. The effective value of the pots is therefore halved, with zero voltage 
occurring halfway along the pot tracks. The true input impedance when flat is therefore 
4k7 i 2.5k i 2.5k  987 Ω, which is confirmed by simulation. 
 When the tone-control is not set flat, but to boost, then at those frequencies the inverted 
signal at the output is larger than the input. This makes the input impedance lower than for 
the flat case; when the circuit is simulated it can be seen that the input impedance varies with 
frequency inversely to the amount of boost. Conversely, when the tone-control is set to cut, 
the inverted signal at the output is reduced and the input impedance is higher than in the flat 
case. This is summarised in  Table 15.3 , with R1, R2  4k7. 

428 Chapter 15
    Table 15.3 shows that the input impedance falls to the worryingly low figure of 481 Ω at 
maximum HF and LF boost. In this case the gain is 10 dB, and so the input voltage into this 
impedance cannot exceed 3 Vrms without the tone-control output clipping. This limits the 
current required of the preceding stage, and there are not likely to be problems with increased 
distortion if this is 5532 or LM4562 based. 
 As mentioned earlier, this tone control was developed from an earlier version designed 
some 16 years earlier. It is instructive to take a quick look at the changes that were 
made: 
 •  All opamps changed from 5532 to LM4562 to reduce noise and distortion .
 •  A general impedance reduction to reduce noise including the use of 5 kΩ linear pots 
throughout instead of 10 kΩ. 
 •  Frequency control laws improved so the middle of the frequency range corresponds 
with the middle position of the control. 
 •  Three expensive 470 nF polypropylene capacitors in the LF path replaced with four of 
220 nF, giving a cost reduction. The resulting impedance at C14 is quite high at low 
frequencies and the pick up of electrostatic hum must be avoided. 
 •  DC-blocking capacitor C10 added to the LF path frequency control to eliminate 
rustling noises. 
 •  C3 increased from 220 μF to 470 μF to remove a trace of electrolytic capacitor 
distortion at 10 Hz and 9 Vrms out (with max LF freq and max boost). Reduced from 
0.0014% to less than 0.0007%. 
 The electrolytic capacitors in the tone-control are used for DC-blocking only, and have 
no part at all in determining the frequency response. It would be most undesirable if they 
did, both because of the wide tolerance on their value and the distortion generated by 
electrolytics when they have significant signal voltage across them. The design criterion for

these capacitors was that they should be large enough to introduce no distortion at 10 Hz, 
the original values being chosen by the algorithm ‘looks about right’, though I hasten to 
add this was followed up by simulations to check the signal voltages across them and THD 
measurements to confirm all was well. 
 Tilt or tone-balance controls 
 A tilt or tone-balance circuit is operated by a single control and affects not just part of 
the audio spectrum but most or all of it. Typically the high frequencies are boosted as the 
low frequencies are cut, and vice versa. It has to be said that the name ‘tone-balance’ is 
unfortunate as it implies it has something to do with interchannel amplitude balance, which 
it has not. A stereo ‘tone-balance control’ alters the frequency response of both channels 
equally and does not introduce amplitude differences between them, whereas a ‘stereo 
balance control’ is something quite different. It is clearer to call a tone-balance control a tilt 
control, and I shall do so. 
 Tilt controls are (or were) supposedly useful in correcting the overall tonal balance of 
recordings in a smoother way than a Baxandall configuration, which concentrates more 
on the ends of the audio spectrum. An excellent (and very clever) approach to this was 
published by Ambler in 1970 [11] (see  Figure 15.26 ). The configuration is very similar to 
the Baxandall – the ingenious difference here is that the boost/cut pot effectively swaps its 
ends over as the frequency goes up. At low frequencies C1, C2 do nothing, and the gain is 
set by the pot, with maximum cut and boost set by R1, R2. At high-frequencies, where the 
capacitors are effectively short-circuited, R3, R4 overpower R1, R2 and the control works in 
reverse. The range available with the circuit shown is ±8 dB at LF and ±6.5 dB at HF. This 
may seem ungenerous, but because of the way the control works, 8 dB of boost in the bass 
is accompanied by 6.5 dB of cut in the treble, and a total change of 14.5 dB in the relative 
Figure 15.26: Tilt control of the Ambler type

level of the two parts of the spectrum should be enough for anyone. The measured frequency 
response at the control limits is shown in  Figure 15.27 ; the response is not quite flat with the 
control central due to component tolerances. 
 The need for one set of endstop resistors to take over from the other puts limits on the cut/
boost that can be obtained without the input impedance becoming too low; there is, of course, 
also the equivalent need to consider the impedance that opamp A1 sees when driving the 
feedback side of the network. 
 The input impedance at LF, with the control set to flat, is approx 12 kΩ, which is the sum 
of R3 and half of the pot resistance. At HF, however, the impedance falls to 2.0 kΩ. Please 
note that this is not a reflection of the values of the HF endstop resistors R3, R4, but just a 
coincidence. When the control is set to full treble boost, the input impedance at HF falls as 
low as 620 Ω. The impedance at LF holds up rather better at full bass boost, as it cannot fall 
below the value of R1, i.e. 6.8 kΩ. 
 The impedances of the circuit shown here have been reduced by a factor of ten from the 
original values published by Ambler, to make them more suitable for use with opamps. The 
original (1970) gain element was a two-transistor inverting amplifier with limited linearity 
and load-driving capability. Here a stabilising capacitor C3 is shown explicitly, just to remind 
you that you might need one. 
 A famous example of the use of a tilt control is the Quad 44 preamplifier. The tilt facility 
is combined with a bass cut/boost control in one quite complicated stage, and it is not at all 
obvious if the design is based on the Ambler concept. Tilt controls have never really caught 
on and remain rare. One current example is the Classé CP-800 D/A preamplifier, reviewed by

 Stereophile in 2012. [12] This gives a maximum of ±6 dB control at the frequency extremes, 
and is implemented by DSP. In analogue use the signal has to be converted to 24-bit digital 
data, processed, then converted back to analogue, which to me seems somewhat less than 
elegant. 
 Middle controls 
 A middle control affects the centre of the audio band rather than the bass and treble extremes. 
It must be said at once that middle controls, while useful in mixers, are of very little value in 
a preamplifier. If the middle frequency is fixed, then the chances that this frequency and its 
associated Q corresponds with room shortcomings or loudspeaker problems is remote in the 
extreme. Occasionally, middle controls appeared on preamps in the Seventies, but only rarely 
and without much evidence of success in the marketplace. One example is the Metrosound 
ST60 (1972), which had a 3-band Baxandall tone control – more on this below – with slider 
controls. The middle control had a very wide bandwidth centred on 1 kHz, and it was suggested 
that it could be used to depress the whole middle of the audio band to give the effect of a 
loudness control. 
 Middle controls come into their own in mixers and other sound-control equipment, where they 
are found in widely varying degrees of sophistication. In recording applications middle controls 
play a vital part in ‘voicing’ or adjusting the timbres of particular instruments, and the flexibility 
of the equaliser, and its number of controls, defines the possibilities open to the operator. A 
‘presence’ control is centred on the upper-middle audio frequencies so it tends to accentuate 
vocals when used; nowadays the term seems to be restricted to tone controls on electric guitars. 
 The obvious first step is to add a fixed middle control to the standard HF and LF controls. 
Unfortunately, this is not much more useful in a mixer than in a preamplifier. In the past this 
was addressed by adding more fixed middles, so a line-up with a high-middle and a low-
middle would be HF-HMF-LMF-LF, but this takes up more front panel space (which is a 
very precious resource in advanced and complex mixers, and ultimately defined by the length 
of the human arm) without greatly improving the EQ versatility. 
 The minimum facilities in a mixer input channel for proper control are the usual HF and LF 
controls plus a sweep middle with a useful range of centre frequency. This also uses four 
knobs but is much more useful. 
 Fixed frequency Baxandall middle controls 
 Figure 15.28 shows a middle version of a Baxandall configuration. The single control 
RV1 now has around it both the time constants that were before assigned to the separate 
bass and treble controls. R4 and R5 maintain unity gain at DC, and keep the stage biased 
correctly. 

432 Chapter 15
Figure 15.28: Fixed middle control of the Baxandall type. Centre frequency 1.26 kHz
 As the input frequency increases from the bottom of the audio band, the impedance of 
C2 falls and the position of the pot wiper begins to take effect. At a higher frequency, the 
impedance of C1 becomes low enough to effectively tie the two ends of the pot together, so 
that the wiper position no longer has effect and the circuit reverts to having a fixed gain of 
unity. The component values shown give a mid frequency of 1.26 kHz, at a Q of 0.8, with a 
maximum boost/cut of ±15 dB. The Q value is only valid at maximum boost/cut; with less, 
the curve is flatter and the effective Q lower. It is not possible to obtain high values of Q with 
this approach. 
 This circuit gives the pleasingly symmetrical curves shown in  Figure 15.29 , though it has to 
be said that the benefits of exact symmetry are visual rather than audible. 
 As mentioned above, in the simpler mixer input channels it is not uncommon to have 
two fixed mid controls; this is not the ideal arrangement, but it can be implemented very 
neatly and cheaply as in  Figure 15.30 . There are two stages, each of which has two fixed 
bands of EQ. It has the great advantage that there are two inverting stages so the output 
signal ends up back in phase. The first stage needs the extra resistors R5, R6 to maintain 
DC feedback. 
 There will inevitably be some control interaction with this scheme. It could be avoided by 
using four separate stages, but this is most unlikely to be economical for mixers with this 
relatively simple sort of EQ. To minimise interaction, the control bands are allocated between 
the stages to keep the frequencies controlled in a stage as far apart as possible, combining HF 
with LO MID, and LF with HI MID, as shown here. 

Tone controls and equalisers 433

Figure 15.30: A 4-band Baxandall EQ using two stages only
 Three-band Baxandall EQ in one stage 
 The standard Baxandall tone control allows adjustment of two bands with one stage. When 
a three-band EQ is required, it is common practice to use one such stage for HF and LF and 
a following one to implement the middle control only. This has the advantage that the two 
cascaded inverting stages will leave the signal in the correct phase. 

434 Chapter 15
 When this is not a benefit, because a phase inversion is present at some other point in the 
signal path, it is economical to combine HF, MID and LF in one quasi-Baxandall stage. This 
not only reduces component count, but reduces power consumption by saving an opamp. The 
drawback is that cramming all this functionality into one stage requires some compromises 
on control interaction and maximum boost/cut. The circuit shown in  Figure 15.31 gives 
boost/cut limited to ±12 dB in each band. The pots are now 20 kΩ to prevent the input and 
feedback impedances from becoming too low. 
Figure 15.31: The circuit of a Baxandall three-band EQ using one stage only
 The frequency responses for each band are given in  Figures 15.32, 15.33 and 15.34. 
 Wien ﬁ xed middle EQ 
 An alternative way to implement a fixed middle control is shown in  Figure 15.35. Here the 
signal tapped off from RV1 is fed to a Wien bandpass network R1, C1, R2, C2, and returned 
to the opamp non-inverting input. This is the same Wien network as used in audio oscillators. 
 With the values shown, the centre frequency is 2.26 kHz and the Q at max cut/boost is 1.4; 
it gives beautifully symmetrical response curves like those in  Figure 15.33 above, with a 
maximal cut/boost of 15.5 dB.

 Variable-frequency middle EQ 
 A fully variable frequency middle control is much more useful and versatile than any 
combination of fixed or switched middle frequencies. In professional audio this is usually 
called a ‘sweep middle’ EQ. It can be implemented very nicely by putting variable resistances 
in the Wien network of the stage previously described, and the resulting circuit is shown in 
 Figure 15.36. 
 The variable load that the Wien network puts on the cut/boost pot RV1 causes a small amount 
of control interaction, which is normally considered acceptable in middle-range mixers. It 
could be eliminated by putting a unity-gain buffer stage between RV1 wiper and the Wien 
network, but in the middle-range mixers where this circuit is commonly used, this is not 
normally economical. 
 The Wien network here is carefully arranged so that the two variable resistors RV2, RV3 have 
four common terminals, reducing the number of physical terminals required from six to three. 
This is sometimes taken advantage of by pot manufacturers making ganged parts specifically 
for this EQ application. R1, C1 are sometimes seen swapped in position but this naturally 
makes no difference. 
 The combination of a 100k pot and a 6k8 end-stop resistor gives a theoretical frequency 
ratio of 15.7 to 1, which is about as much as can be obtained using reverse-log Law C pots, 
without excessive cramping at the high-frequency end of the scale. This will be marked on 
the control calibrations as a 16 to 1 range.

438 Chapter 15
 The measured frequency responses at the control limits are shown in  Figure 15.37. The 
frequency range is from 150 Hz to 2.3 kHz; the ratio is slightly adrift due to component 
tolerances. 
Figure 15.37: The measured response of the sweep middle circuit at control extremes. The cut/
boost is slightly short of ±15 dB
 Single-gang variable-frequency middle EQ 
 The usual type of sweep middle requires a dual-gang reverse-log pot to set the frequency. 
These are not hard to obtain in production quantities, but can be difficult to get in small 
numbers. They are always significantly more expensive than a single pot. 
 The problem becomes more difficult when the design requires a stereo sweep middle – if 
implemented in the usual way, this demands a four-gang reverse-log pot. Once again, 
such components are available, but only to special order, which means long lead-times 
and significant minimum order quantities. Four-gang pots are not possible in flat-format 
mixer construction where the pots are mounted on their backs, so to speak, on a single big 
horizontal PCB. The incentive to use a standard component is strong, and if a single-gang 
sweep middle circuit can be devised, a stereo EQ only requires a dual-gang pot. 
 This is why many people have tried to design single-gang sweep middle circuits, with varying 
degrees of success. It can be done, so long as you don’t mind some variation of Q with centre

frequency; the big problem is to minimise this interaction. I too have attacked this problem, 
and here is my best shot so far, in  Figure 15.38 
 This circuit is a variation of the Wien middle EQ, the quasi-Wien network being tuned by a 
single control RV2 which not only varies the total resistance of the R5, R7 arm, but also the 
amount of bootstrapping applied to C2, effectively altering its value. This time a unity-gain 
buffer stage A2 has been inserted between RV1 wiper and the Wien network; this helps to 
minimise variation of Q with frequency. 
 The response is shown in  Figure 15.39 ; note that the frequency range has been restricted to 
10:1 to minimise Q variation. The graph shows only maximum cut/boost; at intermediate 
settings the Q variations are much less obvious. 
 It is possible to make a yet more economical version of this, if one accepts somewhat greater 
interaction between boost/cut and Q and frequency. The version shown in  Figure 15.40 omits 
the unity-gain buffer and uses unequal capacitor values to raise the Q of the quasi-Wien 
network, saving an opamp section. The frequency range is still 10:1. 
 The response in  Figure 15.41 shows the drawback – a higher Q at the centre of the frequency 
range than for the three-opamp version. Once again the Q variations will be much less 
obvious at intermediate cut/boost settings.

 The question naturally arises as to whether it is possible to design a single-gang sweep-
middle circuit where there is absolutely no variation of Q with frequency. Is there an 
‘existence theorem’ i.e. a mathematical proof that it can’t be done? At the present time, I 
don’t know . . . 
 Switched-Q variable-frequency Wien middle EQ 
 The next step in increasing EQ sophistication is to provide control over the Q of the middle 
resonance. This is often accomplished by using a full state-variable filter solution, which 
gives fully variable Q that does not interact with the other control settings, but if two or more 
switched values of Q are sufficient, there are much simpler circuits available. 
 One of them is shown in  Figure 15.42 ; here the Wien bandpass network is implemented 
around A2, which is essentially a shunt-feedback stage, with added positive feedback via 
R1, R2 to raise the Q of the resonance. When the Q-switch is in the LO position, the output 
from A2 is fed directly back to the non-inverting input of A1, because R7 is short-circuited. 
When the Q-switch is in the HI position, R9 is switched into circuit and increases the positive 
feedback to A2, raising the Q of the resonance. This also increases the gain at the centre 
frequency, and this is compensated for by the attenuation now introduced by R7 and R8. 
 With the values shown, the two Q values are 0.5 and 1.5. Note the cunning way that 
the Q switch is made to do two jobs at once – changing the Q and also introducing the 
compensating attenuation. If the other half of a two-pole switch is already dedicated to a LED 
indicator, this saves having to go to a four-pole switch. On a large mixing console with many 
EQ sections this sort of economy is important.

 Switchable peak/shelving LF/HF EQ 
 It is frequently desirable to have the highest and lowest frequency EQ sections switchable 
between a peaking (resonance) mode and shelving operation. The peaking mode allows 
relatively large amounts of boost to be applied near the edges of the audio band without 
having a large and undesirable amount occurring outside it. 
 Figure 15.43 shows one way of accomplishing this. It is essentially a switchable combination 
of the variable-frequency HF shelving circuit of  Figure 15.18 and the sweep-middle circuit 
of  Figure 15.36 ; when the switches are in the PEAK position the signal tapped off RV1 is 
fed via the buffer A2 to a Wien bandpass network C2, RV2, R5, C3, R6, RV3, and the circuit 
has a peak/dip characteristic. When the switches are in the SHLV (shelving) position, the 
first half of the Wien network is disconnected and C1 is switched in, and in conjunction with 
R6 and RV3 forms a first-order high-pass network, fed by an attenuated signal because R2 
is now grounded. This switched attenuation factor is required to give equal amounts of cut/
boost in the two modes because the high-pass network has less loss than the Wien network. 
R7 allows fine-tuning of the maximum cut/boost; reducing it increases the range. 
 As always we want our switches to work as hard as possible, and the lower switch can be 
seen to vary the attenuation brought about by R1, R2 with one contact and switch in C3 with 
Figure 15.42: Variable-freq switched-Q middle control of the Wien type

the other. Unfortunately, in this case two poles of switching are required. The response of the 
circuit at one frequency setting can be seen in   Figure 15.44. 
 When the peaking is near the edges of the audio band, this is called RTF (return-to-flat) 
operation, or sometimes RTZ (return-to-zero) operation as the gain returns to unity (Zero dB) 
outside the peaking band.

444 Chapter 15
 Parametric middle EQ 
 A normal second-order resonance is completely defined by specifying its centre frequency, its 
bandwidth or Q, and the gain at the peak. In mathematical language, these are the parameters 
of the resonance. Hence an equaliser which allows all three to be changed independently 
(with a proviso on that coming up soon) is called a parametric equaliser. Upscale mixing 
consoles typically have two fully parametric middle sections, and usually the LF and HF 
can also be switched from shelving to peaking mode, when they become two more fully 
parametric sections. 
 The parametric middle EQ shown in  Figure 15.45 is included partly for its historical interest, 
showing how opamps and discrete transistor circuitry were combined in the days before 
completely acceptable opamps became affordable. I designed it in 1979 for a now long-gone 
company called Progressive Electronics, which worked in a niche market for low-noise 
mixing consoles. The circuitry I developed was a quite subtle mix of discrete transistor and 
opamp circuitry which gave a significantly better noise performance than designs based 
entirely on the less-than-perfect opamps of the day; in time, of course, this niche virtually

Tone controls and equalisers 445
disappeared, as they are wont to do. This parametric middle EQ was used, in conjunction with 
the usual HF and LF controls, in a channel module called the CM4. 
 The boost/cut section used an opamp because of the need for both inverting and non-inverting 
inputs. I used a 741S, which was a completely different animal from the humble 741, with a 
much better distortion performance and slew rate; it was, however, markedly more expensive 
and only used where its superior performance was really necessary. The unity-gain buffer 
Q1, Q2 which ensured a low-impedance drive to the state-variable bandpass filter was a 
discrete circuit block, as its function is simple to implement. Q1 and Q2 form a CFP emitter-
follower. R13 was a ‘base-stopper’ resistor to make sure that the Q1, Q2 local feedback loop 
did not exhibit VHF parasitic oscillation. With the wisdom of hindsight, putting a 2k2 resistor 
directly in the signal path can only degrade the noise performance, and if I was doing it again 
I would try to solve the problem in a more elegant fashion. The high input impedance of the 
buffer stage (set by R14) means that C6 can be a small non-electrolytic component. 
 The wholly conventional state-variable band-pass filter requires a differential stage U2, which 
once again is best implemented with an opamp, and another expensive 741S was pressed into 
service. The two integrators U3, U4 presented an interesting problem. Since only an inverting 
input is required, discrete amplifiers could have been used without excessive circuit complexity; 
a two or possibly three-transistor circuit (see  Chapter 3 ) would have been adequate. However, the 
PCB area for this approach just wasn’t there, and so opamps had to be used. To put in two more 
741S opamps would have been too costly, and so that left a couple of the much-despised 741 
opamps. In fact, they worked entirely satisfactorily in this case, because they were in integrator 
stages. The poor HF distortion and slew rate were not really an issue because of the large 
amount of NFB at HF, and the fact that integrator outputs by definition do not slew quickly. The 
indifferent noise performance was also not an issue because the falling frequency response of 
the integrators filtered out most of the noise. In my designs the common-or-garden 741 was only 
used in this particular application. Looking at the circuit again, I have reservations about the not 
inconsiderable 741 bias currents flowing through the two sections of the frequency-control pot 
RV2, which could make them noisy, but it seemed to work alright at the time. 
 The filter Q was set by the resistance of R6, R7 to ground. It does not interact with filter 
gain or centre-frequency. The Q control could easily have been made fully variable by using 
a potentiometer here, but there was only room on the channel front panel for a small toggle 
switch. Note the necessity for the DC-blocking capacitor C3, because all the circuitry is 
biased at V/2 above ground. 
 The filtered signal is fed back to the boost/cut section through R17, and I have to say that at 
this distance of time I am unsure why that resistor was present. It could only impair the noise 
performance. Grounding it would give an EQ-cancel that would also stop noise from the 
state-variable filter. 

446 Chapter 15
 It is worth noting that the design dates back to when the use of single-supply rails was 
customary. In part, this was due to grave and widely-held doubts about the reliability of 
electrolytic coupling capacitors with no DC voltage across them, which would be the case if 
dual rails were used. As it happened, there proved to be no real problem with this, and things 
would have progressed much faster if capacitor manufacturers had not been so very wary of 
committing themselves to approving non-polarised operation. The use of a single supply rail 
naturally requires that the circuitry is biased to V/2, and this voltage was generated in the 
design shown by R15, R16, and C5; it was then distributed to wherever it was required in 
the channel signal path. The single rail was at 24 V, because 24 V IC regulators were the 
highest voltage versions available, and nobody wants to get involved with designing discrete 
power supply regulators if they can avoid it. This is obviously equivalent to a ±12 V dual rail 
supply, compared with the ±15 V or ±17 V that was adopted when dual-rail powering became 
universal, and so gave a headroom that was lower by 1.9 dB and 3.0 dB respectively. 
 This design is included here because it is a good example of making use of diverse circuit 
techniques to obtain the best possible performance/cost ratio at a given point in time. It could 
be brought up-to-date quite quickly by replacing all the antique opamps and the discrete 
unity-gain buffer with 5532s or other modern types. 
 Modern parametric equalisers naturally use all-opamp circuitry.  Figure 15.46 shows a 
parametric EQ stage I designed back in 1991; it is relatively conventional, with a three-stage 
state variable filter composed of A2, A3 and A4. There is however an important improvement 
on the standard circuit topology. Most of the noise in a parametric equaliser comes from 
the filter path. In this design the filter path signal level is set to be 6 dB higher than usual, 
with the desired return level being restored by the attenuator R6, R7. This attenuates the 
Figure 15.46: Variable-freq variable-Q middle control. State-variable type

Tone controls and equalisers 447
filter noise as well, and the result is a parametric section approximately 6 dB quieter than 
the industry standard. The circuit is configured so that, despite this raised level, clipping 
cannot occur in the filter with any combination of control settings. If excess boost is applied, 
clipping can only happen at the output of A1, as usual. 
 Other features are the Q control RV4, which is configured to give a wide parameter range 
without affecting the gain. Note the relatively low values for the DC feedback resistors 
R1 and R2, chosen to minimise Johnson noise without causing excessive opamp loading. 
 This equaliser section has component values for typical low-mid use, with centre frequency 
variable over a wide range from 70 Hz to 1.2 kHz, and Q variable from 0.7 to 5. The cut and 
boost range is the usual ±15 dB 
 Graphic equalisers 
 Graphic equalisers are so-called because their cut/boost controls are vertical sliders, the 
assumption being that a graph of the frequency response will pass through the slider knob 
positions. Graphic equalisers can have any number of bands, from three to 31, the latter 
having bands one-third of an octave wide. This is the most popular choice for serious room 
equalisation work as bands one-third-octave wide relate to the perceptual critical bands of 
human hearing. 
 Graphic equalisers are not normally fitted to large mixing consoles, but are often found on 
smaller powered mixers, usually in the path between the stereo mix and the power amplifiers. 
The number of bands provided is limited by the space on the mixer control surface, and is 
usually in the range seven to ten. 
 There is more than one way to make a graphic equaliser, but the most common version 
is shown in its basic concept in  Figure 15.4 7 , with some typical values. L1, C1 and R3 
make up an LCR series resonant circuit which has a high impedance except around its 
resonant frequency; at this frequency the reactances of L1, C1 cancel each other out and the 
impedance to ground is simply that of R3. At resonance, when the wiper of RV1 is at the R1 
end, the LCR circuit forms the lower leg of an attenuator of which R1 is the upper arm; this 
attenuates the input signal and a dip in the frequency response is therefore created. When 
RV1 wiper is at the R2 end, an attenuator is formed with R2 that reduces the feedback factor 
at resonance and so creates a peak in the response. It is not exactly intuitively obvious, but 
this process does give symmetrical cut/boost curves. At frequencies away from resonance the 
impedance of the RLC circuit is high and the gain of the circuit is unity. 
 The beauty of this arrangement is that two, three or more LCR circuits, with associated cut/
boost pots, can be connected between the two opamp inputs, giving us an equaliser with 
pretty much as many bands as we want. Obviously, the more bands we have, the narrower 

448 Chapter 15
they must be to fit together properly. A good example of a classic LCR graphic design was 
published by Reg Williamson in 1973 [13]. 
 As described in  Chapter 2 , inductors are in general thoroughly unwelcome in a modern 
design, and the great breakthrough in graphic equalisers came when the LCR circuits were 
replaced by gyrator circuits that emulated them but used only resistors, capacitors and a gain 
element. It is not too clear just when this idea spread, but I can testify that by 1975 gyrators 
were the standard approach, and the use of inductors would have been thought risible. 
 The basic notion is shown in  Figure 15.48 ; C1 works as a normal capacitor as in the 
LCR circuit, while C2 pretends to be the inductor L1. As the applied frequency rises, the 
attenuation of the high-pass network C2–R1 reduces, so that a greater signal is applied to 
unity-gain buffer A1 and it more effectively bootstraps the point X, making the impedance 
from it to ground increase. Therefore we have a circuit fragment where the impedance 
rises proportionally to frequency – which is just how an inductor behaves. There are limits 
to the Q values that can be obtained with this circuit because of the inevitable presence of 
R1 and R2. 
 The sample values in  Figure 15.48 synthesise a grounded inductor of 100 mH (which would 
be quite a hefty component if it was real) in series with a resistance of 2 kΩ. Note the 
surprisingly simple equation for the inductor value. Another important point is that the opamp 
is used as a unity-gain buffer, which means that the early gyrator graphic equalisers could use 
a simple emitter-follower in this role. The linearity was naturally not so good, but it worked 
and made graphic equalisers affordable. 
Figure 15.47: The basic idea behind graphic equalisers; gain is unity with the wiper central

Tone controls and equalisers 449
 A simple seven-band gyrator-based graphic equaliser is shown in  Figure 15.49. The maximal 
cut/boost is ±8 dB. The band centre-frequencies are 63 Hz, 160 Hz, 410 Hz, 1 kHz, 2.5 kHz, 
7.7 kHz and 16 kHz. The Q of each band at maximum cut or boost is 0.9 .
 The response of each band is similar to that shown in  Figure 15.33 above. The maximum 
Q value is only obtained at maximum cut or boost. For all intermediate settings the Q is lower. 
This behaviour is typical of the straightforward equaliser design shown here, and is usually

450 Chapter 15
referred to as ‘proportional-Q’ operation; it results in a frequency response which is very 
different from what might be expected on looking at the slider positions. 
 There is however another mode of operation called ‘constant-Q’ in which the Q of each band 
does not decrease as the cut/boost is reduced [14]. This gives a frequency response that more 
closely resembles the slider positions. 
 The graphic equaliser described here has a symmetrical response, also known as a reciprocal 
response; the curves are the same for cut and for boost operations. It is also possible to design 
an equaliser for an asymmetric or non-reciprocal response, in which the boost curves are 
as shown above but the cut response is a narrow notch. This is often considered to be more 
effective when the equaliser is being used to combat feedback in a sound reinforcement 
system.

 Mixer architectures 
 Introduction 
 A large mixing console arguably represents the most demanding area of analogue audio 
design. The steady advance of digital media demands that every part of the chain that takes 
music from performer to consumer must be near perfect, as the comfortable certainty that 
everything will be squeezed through the quality bottleneck of either analogue tape or vinyl 
disc now looks very old-fashioned. 
 The technical problems that must be overcome in a professional mixing console are many and 
varied, and often unique to console design. A large number of signals flow in a small space 
and they must be kept strictly apart until the operator chooses to mix them; crosstalk must be 
exceedingly low. 
 There may be 72 input channels or more, each with many stages that all have the potential to 
add distortion and noise to the precious signal. Even summing these signals together, while 
sounding trivially easy, is in practice a major challenge. The quality requirements, especially 
for recording consoles, are much more demanding than those for the most expensive hifi 
equipment, because degradation introduced at this stage can never be retrieved. 
 Performance factors 
 Two primary requirements of modern consoles are very low noise and minimal distortion. 
Since a comprehensive console must pass the audio through a large number of circuit stages 
(perhaps over 100 from microphone to final mixdown) great attention to detail is essential at 
each stage to prevent a build-up of noise and distortion; one of the most important trade-offs 
is the impedance of the circuitry surrounding the opamp, for if this is too high Johnson noise 
will be increased, while if it is too low an opamp will exhibit non-linearity in struggling to 
drive it. 
 The choice of opamp is also critical, for cost considerations discourage the global use of 
expensive ICs. In a console with many stages of signal processing, this becomes a major 
concern; nonetheless it is possible to keep the right-through THD below 0.002% at 20 dB 
above the normal operating level, so that at normal levels it is unmeasurable .

452 Chapter 16
 I will use the term mixer, mixing console, and mixing desk interchangeably where it will 
make the text less clunky. In the USA it is sometimes called simply ‘The Board’. I hope I 
can put ‘mixer’ without anyone thinking I am referring to the front end of a radio or a kitchen 
appliance, or indeed anything concrete-related. Throughout this chapter the various sections 
of the mixer – the channels, groups, master etc, will be referred to as ‘modules’, even if they 
are not constructed as separate physical modules. 
 In hifi, the preservation of absolute phase has only recently come to be considered necessary; 
with normal listening material it appears highly unlikely that it actually makes any audible 
difference, but it unquestionably looks good on the spec. In mixer design the meticulous 
preservation of phase is a rigid requirement, to avoid the possible cancellation of signals. 
Both summing amplifiers and most EQ sections use shunt feedback and thus invert the signal, 
and it is sometimes necessary to include inverting stages that do nothing but get the phase 
straight again. It is a mark of good design to keep such stages to a minimum. 
 Mixer internal levels 
 The internal signal levels of any mixing console are always a compromise between noise 
and headroom. A higher level means that the signal is less compromised by circuit noise, 
but makes inadvertent overload more likely, and vice versa. The levels chosen depend on 
the purpose of the console. If you are recording you only have to get it right once, but you 
do have to get it exactly right, i.e. with the best possible signal-to-noise ratio, so the internal 
level is relatively high, very often 2 dBu (615 mV rms) which gives a headroom of about 
22 dB. In broadcast work to air you only have one chance to get it right, and a mildly 
impaired signal-to-noise ratio is much preferable to a crunching overload, especially since 
the FM or DAB channel has limited noise performance anyway, so the internal levels are 
considerably lower. The Neve 51 Series broadcast consoles used 16 dBu (123 mV rms) 
which gives a much increased headroom of 36 dB at the cost of noise performance. At least 
one manufacturer has used balanced mixing buses to reduce the impact of the lower internal 
levels on signal-to-noise ratio. 
 As a sidelight on this issue, I might mention a mixer design I worked on some years ago. The 
decision was taken (no, not by me) to use an internal level of 6 dBu instead of the usual 
2 dBu to improve headroom in live situations, the assumption being that 4 dB greater 
internal noise would go unnoticed. It most certainly did not, and vociferous complaints during 
beta-testing led to a rapid redesign to convert it back to the old 2 dBu level. Fortunately we 
were ready for this one, and the design had been arranged so that the internal level could be 
altered simply by changing resistor values. 
 An internal level of 2 dBu does have one unique advantage; doubling the level, as is done 
by most forms of balanced output stage, gets you directly to the professional 4 dBu level. 

Mixer architectures 453
 Mixer architecture 
 A mixing console has a number of input channels that can be summed into groups, and these 
groups again summed into a stereo mix as the final result. Small mixers often have no groups 
and mix directly to stereo. 
 The structure and signal flow of a mixing console depends very much on its purpose. A 
recording console needs track return sections to allow the creation of a monitor mix so that 
as a track is recorded, those already done can be played back at roughly the same levels 
they will have in the final mix; this is essential so new material can be synchronised with that 
already in existence. While it is quite possible to use a recording-oriented console for PA 
work, the reverse is much more difficult, and usually impractical. 
 A sound-reinforcement (PA) console does not need monitor sections, so it can be somewhat 
simpler, but it typically is fitted with a large number of effects returns. The output from a PA 
console at a large event is not likely to be in stereo – there will be multiple speakers each of 
which requires an individual feed with different equalisation and delay requirements; often 
there is a centre output. 
 In PA work there are often two mixers. The front-of-house (FOH) mixer usually resides in 
the middle of the audience or in a control-room at the back. If the mixer is in the audience, 
the less room it takes up the better, as it is occupying seats that could have been paid for. Size 
is also very much an issue for mixers intended for installation in a control-room, as access to 
these is often cramped and difficult. 
 The second type of PA mixer is the so-called monitor mixer. PA work makes much use of 
‘monitors’ i.e. small speakers, often wedge-shaped, that are placed close to the musician 
so that they can hear their output clearly without straining to pick it out of the main mix. 
Creating these foldback feeds on a separate mixer where basically each channel consists 
of a bank of aux sends (from 12 to 32 may be available) gives much greater flexibility 
than relying on the relatively few aux sends available on the FOH desk. The inputs to the 
monitor mixers are taken from the inputs to the FOH console by a splitter box, usually 
transformer-based, at the stage end of the ‘snake’ cable to the FOH console. Traditionally 
monitor mixers were placed just out of sight at the side of the stage, so that disgruntled 
performers could signal to the hapless monitor engineer that the foldback mix was not to 
their liking. The widespread adoption of intercoms has given more flexibility in monitor 
desk placement. 
 Broadcast consoles are more specialised in their layout and no one expects to be able to use 
them for recording or PA applications. 
 Recording consoles come in two different formats. The first and more traditional is called a 
split, separate-group, or European-style arrangement and has input channels arranged in one 

454 Chapter 16
bank, typically to the left of the master section, with the groups banked to the right of it; on a 
large console there may be a further set of channels to the right of the groups. 
 The second format is called the in-line arrangement, and has the channels and groups built 
into the same module. Normally there is a row of channel/group modules to both the left and 
right of a central master section. In-line consoles are more compact and make more efficient 
use of the electronic facilities, but they are conceptually more complex and somewhat harder 
to use. They are not popular in PA work where you need to do things quickly, in real-time, 
without juggling a block-diagram in your head. 
 In the sections that follow we will look at the internals of generic mixers that do not follow 
any particular design but are configured to bring out as many instructive points as possible. 
 The split mixing architecture 
 Figure 16.1 shows the basic arrangement of a split (separate-group) mixer.  Its design is 
oriented to recording, but like many small and medium sized mixers it could also be used 
effectively for PA work. 
 Each channel has both a microphone and line-level input, with a wide-ranging gain control. 
Once it has been raised to the nominal internal level of the console, the signal is processed by 
the equalisation section, controlled in level by the channel fader, and then routed to a group 
or pair of groups, or directly to the stereo L–R bus. The position of the channel signal in the 
overall stereo image is set by the panoramic potentiometer (universally known as a panpot) 
that controls the proportion of the signal sent to left and right. The channel also has auxiliary 
send controls that feed the channel signal to the auxiliary buses; sends taken off before the 
fader are called prefade and are normally used for foldback, i.e. helping the musician hear the 
sound they are producing. Sends taken off after the fader, so that their level is dependant on 
the fader position, are called postfade sends and are normally used for adding effects such as 
reverberation that are expected to vary in level with the original signal. 
 The final feed from the channel to the buses is the prefade-listen (PFL); when the PFL switch 
is pressed, the prefade channel signal is sent to the master module via the PFL bus, where 
it automatically replaces the normal stereo mix feed to the control-room monitor (CRM) 
loudspeakers. 
 The group/monitor modules contain both the group section and one or two monitor sections. 
The group consists of a summing amplifier that collects together all the signals sent to its 
group bus, and passes it to the outside world via a fader and an output amplifier. When 
recording, this group signal is sent to one track of the recording machine. The monitor 
sections allow tracks which are already recorded to be played back to the stereo mix bus via 
a level control and a panpot, so that a rough idea of what the final mix will sound like can 

 Figure 16.1 : Block diagram of a split-format mixer with four groups and four aux sends 

456 Chapter 16
be set up as early in the recording process as possible. One of the monitor sections will be 
switchable between the group output and the track return so the monitor mix can be made 
up of tracks that are being recorded as well as those which have already been laid down. 
This group/track switching is not shown in  Figure 16.1 , to aid clarity, but is fully shown 
in   Figure 16.4 below. Lack of space means that the monitor return sections usually have 
only simple EQ or none at all, but they almost always have a prefade aux send for foldback 
purposes. A postfade send is also extremely useful as the rough monitor mix is much more 
convincing if reverberation can be added as appropriate; this is called ‘wet’ monitoring. The 
monitor sections often each have a PFL switch. 
 When recording is finished, and mixdown begins, the full facilities of the channels are 
required, and so the track return signal is now sent to the channel line input and the channel 
routed to the stereo mix bus. This is often a connection normalled through the line input 
jack, so that the input amplifier receives the track return signal at all times unless a jack is 
inserted. Back in the days of tape machines, this facility was called ‘tape normalling’ but now 
‘track return normalling’ describes it rather better. The monitor sections in the group/monitor 
modules are now no longer needed, but since they are routed to the stereo mix bus they can 
be used as extra effects returns.  
 The master section contains the summing amplifiers for the stereo mix bus, which feed a 
stereo fader and suitable output amplifiers. These provide the final feed to the two-track 
recording device at mixdown. Normally, this stereo output is also sent to a pair of meters and 
the control-room monitor (CRM) loudspeakers, the latter via a volume control, but the meters 
and CRM speakers can also be switched to monitor the return from the two-track recorder. 
When any PFL switch on the console is pressed, this is detected and the PFL signal (in mono) 
is fed to the meters and CRM speakers instead, so the signal quality and level from any 
channel can be assessed. 
 The master section also contains the summing and level controls for the aux send buses, and 
may also incorporate talkback facilities and a line-up oscillator; these features are dealt with 
in more detail later in this chapter. 
 The in-line mixing architecture 
 Figure 16.2 shows the basic arrangement of an in-line mixer, essentially intended for recording. 
There are now no group/monitor modules, their functions being performed by what might be 
called channel/group/monitor modules. Only four group buses are shown for clarity, but in 
practice there would normally be a much higher number, to make use of the in-line format. 
 The group summing amplifier is now part of the channel. It no longer has its own fader; instead 
the summing amp gain is controlled by a rotary ‘bus trim’ control so overload can avoided. This 
is normally placed out of the way at the very top of the module. The group signal is sent out 

Mixer architectures 457
to the recording machine, and the track return comes back in, usually via a balanced amplifier. 
A track/group switch SW2 selects either the group or the track return signal for the metering 
and the monitor path; as shown in the figure it consists only of a monitor fader and a monitor 
panpot which send the signal to the stereo mix bus to create a monitor mix. The monitor fader 
is normally a short fader mounted on the channel, as opposed to the long channel fader which is 
right at the front of the console. Sometimes a rotary monitor fader is fitted.  
 There are two slightly differing approaches to the operation of an in-line module: 
 •  In the first approach, at mixdown switch SW1 now selects the track return signal 
rather than the line input, and the signal reaches the stereo mix bus via the full 
facilities of the channel. Sometimes additional switching allows the monitor path to 
 Figure 16.2 : Block diagram of an in-line mixer with N groups and four aux sends 

458 Chapter 16
be used as an extra effects return, as in split consoles. Typically the line input jack is 
pressed into service as the input connector for this purpose. 
 •  An alternative design approach is not to switch the source of the channel path to 
the track return at mixdown, but instead to move the whole EQ section from the 
channel to the monitor path. This means that the short monitor fader would have 
to be used for level adjustment, which is not ideal when there is a long fader right 
in front of you. This has particular force when fader automation is fitted, for it is 
normally only applied to the long fader. A switch called a ‘fader flip’ is therefore 
fitted which swaps over the function of the two faders, allowing the long fader to 
be used at mixdown. This sort of approach involves a lot of reconfiguration when 
switching from record to mixdown mode, and on the more sophisticated consoles 
this is handled entirely by electronic switching, with global control from the master 
section, so that only one switch needs to be pressed to change the console mode. 
This second method always seems to me to be unnecessarily complex, but it has 
seen extensive use. 
 The master section shown in  Figure 16.2 is identical to that shown for the split console in 
 Figure 16.1 . 
 A closer look at split format modules 
 We will now look in more detail at the channel, group and master modules that make up a 
split mixing console: 
 The channel module (split format) 
 Figure 16.3 shows a typical input channel for a relatively simple split-format mixing 
console. The input stage provides switchable balanced mic and line inputs; the mic input 
has an impedance of 1–2 kΩ, which provides appropriate loading for a 200 Ω mic capsule. 
If a 48 V phantom power facility to power microphones is provided, it is independently 
switchable on each channel. The line input will have a bridging impedance of not less than 
10 kΩ. The mic preamplifier in particular will have a wide range of gain, such as 0 to 70 dB, 
while the line input tends to have a more restricted range such as 20 to 10 dB. The track 
return from the recording machine is shown connected through to the line input via the 
normalling contact of the line jack socket, so that mixdown with the full channel facilities 
can begin as soon as the mic/line switch is set to ‘line’, so long as no jack has been inserted 
into the line input to break the normalling contact. The line input is shown as unbalanced in 
 Figure 16.3 for clarity, but in practice it would usually be a balanced input using the tip and 
ring connections of the jack socket. 

 Figure 16.3: Block diagram of a typical channel module for a small mixer 

460 Chapter 16
 The input stage is followed immediately by a switchable high-pass filter (usually 3 dB 
at 100 Hz) to remove low-frequency disturbances picked up by the microphone as soon as 
possible; if not filtered out these can eat up headroom. The filter is usually second or third 
order, giving a roll-off of 12 or 18 dB per octave respectively.  
 The tone-control section (universally known in the pro audio business as ‘EQ’ or equalisation) 
typically includes one or more mid-band resonance controls as well as the usual shelving 
Baxandall-type high and low controls. On all but the simplest mixers, the EQ section can be 
switched out to allow before/after comparisons. 
 The larger and more sophisticated consoles incorporate dynamics sections into each channel. 
This is not shown  in Figure 16.3 to aid clarity. The dynamics facilities available vary but 
usually include compression, limiting, and sometimes noise-gating; some consoles have been 
produced with just the noise-gate function, as it is easier to fit the required electronics into a 
limited space. A perennial problem with this sort of thing is finding panel room for the extra 
controls required; the permissible length of a module is limited by the reach of the human arm. 
 Next comes the insert point, though in some designs it may be configured so it can be placed 
ahead of the EQ and dynamics section instead. This is a jack or pair of jacks that allow 
external processing units to be plugged into the signal path. When nothing is plugged in, the 
‘normalling’ contacts on the jack socket allow the signal to flow through unchanged. 
 The PFL (prefade-listen) switch routes the post-insert signal to the master module and the 
monitor speakers independently of all other controls; a PFL-detect bus signals the master module 
to switch the studio monitoring speakers from the normal stereo mix bus to the PFL bus. 
 Next in the chain comes the channel on switch. This may be either a simple mechanical 
switch or an electronic mute block. Note the PFL feed is taken off  before the ‘on’ switch so 
the channel signal is always accessible. The channel level in the mix is controlled by a linear 
fader with a postfade amplifier typically giving 10 dB of gain, and the panpot sets the stereo 
positioning, odd group numbers being treated as left, and even as right. 
 The channel shown has three auxiliary sends. The auxiliary sends of a console represent 
an extra mixing system that works independently of the main groups; the number and 
configuration of these sends have a large effect in determining the overall versatility of the 
console. Each send control provides a feed to a console-wide bus; this is centrally summed 
and then sent out of the console. Sends come essentially in two kinds. Prefade sends are taken 
from before the main channel fader, and are therefore independent of its setting. Post-fade 
sends take their feed from after the fader, so that the send level falls or rises according to the 
fader setting. 
 Prefade sends are normally used for ‘foldback’; i.e. sending the artist a headphone feed 
of what he/she is perpetrating, which is important if electronic manipulation is part of the 

Mixer architectures 461
creative process, and essential if the artist is adding extra material that must be in time with 
that already recorded. In the latter case, the existing tracks are played back to the artist via the 
prefade sends on the monitor sections. 
 Postfade sends are used as effects sends; their source is after the fader, so that the effect will 
be faded down at the same rate as the untreated signal, maintaining the same ratio. The sum 
of all feeds to a given bus is sent to an external effects unit and the output of this returned to 
the console. This allows many channels to share one expensive device, such as a high-quality 
digital reverb, and for this sort of purpose is much more appropriate than patching processors 
into the channel insert points. 
 There may be anything from one to twelve or more sends available. In the example shown, the 
first send (Aux 1) is a dedicated prefade send which is typically used for foldback. The third 
(Aux 3) is a dedicated postfade send, typically used for effects such as reverb. The second send 
(Aux 2) can be switched so it is either prefade or postfade. In a recording console the greatest 
need for foldback sends is during track laying, while effect sends are in greatest demand at 
mixdown; it is therefore common for some or all of the sends on a channel to be switchable 
prefade or postfade. 
 On more sophisticated consoles, it is often possible to switch every auxiliary send between 
pre and post to give maximal flexibility. Traditionally, this meant pressing a switch on every 
input module, since it is most unlikely that a mixture of pre- and post-sends on the same 
bus would be useful for anything. On a 64-input console this is a laborious process. More 
advanced designs minimise the effort by setting pre/post selection for each auxiliary bus with 
a master switch that controls solid-state pre/post switching in each module. An example of 
this approach is the Soundcraft 3200 recording console. 
 Effect return modules 
 In complex mixdowns, it may be necessary to return a large number of effects to the mix. 
While, as described above, it is often possible to press unused monitor sections or channel 
modules into service as effect returns, sometimes this just does not provide enough and 
specialised ‘effects return’ modules may be fitted. These usually have facilities intermediate 
between the channels and the monitor sections, and it is common to fit two, and sometimes 
even four, into the space occupied by a channel module. The returned effect, which may well 
now be in stereo (such as the output of a digital reverb unit, for example) is usually added to 
the stereo mix bus via level and pan controls. 
 The group module 
 Figure 16.4 shows a typical group module for a recording desk. Each mix bus has its own 
summing amplifier; the summed group signal is then sent to an insert so external processing 

462 Chapter 16
can be applied. The insert send is very often arranged for ground-cancelling operation, for 
the simple reason that the summing amp inherently phase-inverts the signal, which must be 
returned to the correct polarity by another amplifier stage before it meets the outside world. 
This second stage can be arranged to be ground-cancelling at minimal expense. The operation 
of ground-cancelling outputs is described in  Chapter 19 .  
 The signal from the insert return goes to the group fader. Like that of the channel, it is a linear 
fader with a postfade amplifier typically giving 10 dB of gain. The signal then goes to an 
output amplifier suitable for driving the recording device, possibly via lengthy cables. On all 
but the cheapest designs this is a balanced output. 
 The second major function of the typical group module is to allow the creation of a monitor 
mix so that as a track is recorded, those already done can be played back at roughly the same 
 Figure 16.4 : Block diagram of a typical group module for a small recording mixer 

Mixer architectures 463
levels they will have in the final mix; this is obviously essential to allow new material to be 
synchronised with that already in existence. Back in the days of tape recording machines, the 
monitor playback had to be done by the record head, as the playback head was physically 
displaced and so would have given a delayed signal; this meant the quality of the monitor mix 
was compromised as the record head was optimised for recording and not playback. With 
digital recording this is of course not a problem. 
 The monitor section typically consists of a balanced line input to prevent ground-loop 
problems with the recorder, some form of switching between the group and recorder return 
(so the track being recorded can be incorporated into the monitor mix) and level and panpot 
controls. EQ is not often fitted for reasons of space, but aux sends for foldback and effects 
are standard, because adding reverb to the monitor mix makes it much more realistic. A PFL 
switch for each monitor section is usually provided. 
 Normally relatively few tracks are recorded at a time, so it is sensible to have more monitor 
sections than groups. For example, a 4-group mixer can be very effectively used with an 
8-track recorder if Group 1 is connected to Track 1 and Track 5, Group 2 is connected to 
Track 2 and Track 6, and so on. The track to be recorded is selected at the recorder. To 
make use of this, each group module will contain one actual group section and two monitor 
sections, which explains why there is not normally room for even basic EQ in the monitor 
sections. 
 The master module 
 Figure 16.5 shows the basics of a typical master section. It contains the summing amplifiers 
for the stereo mix bus, with their associated insert send amplifiers and insert points. This 
is followed by a stereo fader (sometimes implemented as two mono faders with the knobs 
mounted immediately next to each other), a 10 dB post amp, and a balanced or ground-
cancelling output stage which feeds the two-track recorder during mixdown. 
 The stereo mix bus normally drives the L–R meters and the control-room monitor (CRM) 
loudspeakers, but a manual source-select switch allows this feed to be replaced by the 
return signal from the two-track recorder for quality checking of the final stereo recording. 
Whenever a PFL switch anywhere on the console is pressed, the PFL-detect system responds 
and activates two solid-state switches that replace the stereo monitor signal with the PFL 
signal. The L–R meter feeds are taken off after the PFL-switched so those meters can be used 
to check the level at whichever point in the system the PFL switch in question happens to be.  
 The master section also contains the summing and level controls for the aux send buses. The 
auxes may have dedicated meters or just a PFL switch each. 
 The master module will also carry any master status switches for globally changing things such 
as group/recorder switching for the monitor sections, pre/post operation of auxes, and so on. 

464 Chapter 16
 Talkback and oscillator systems 
 The talkback system allows the mixing engineer to talk to the musicians in the studio or add 
spoken comments to the recording, using a microphone mounted on the console. Back in the 
day it was considered cool to mount the talkback microphone on a flexible gooseneck, but 
 Figure 16.5 : Block diagram of a typical master module for a small mixer 

Mixer architectures 465
these get in the way and the modern approach is to have a small electret microphone mounted 
flush with the master module panel. 
 For talkback to the studio the microphone feed is routed to the aux buses, on the 
assumption that one or more of these will be in use for foldback and so will be connected 
to a loudspeaker in the studio area. Routing may also be provided to a dedicated talkback 
loudspeaker. In many cases there is a facility to route to the first two auxes only, as these will 
almost certainly be used for foldback purposes (see the typical system in   Figure 16.6 ). 
 For recording identification, the microphone feed is routed to the group buses. This facility, 
which allows the engineer to identify a recording by saying something like ‘Spinal Tap- take 
147’ is often called a ‘slate’ facility, by analogy with the film industry.  
 When the talkback facility is used, there is a danger of acoustical feedback. If a microphone 
in the studio is active and routed through channel and group to the control-room monitors, 
the monitor speaker output will be picked up by the talkback microphone, fed to the 
studio . . . and away she goes. It is therefore normally arranged that pressing any of the 
talkback switches will attenuate or cut completely the monitor speaker signal. On larger 
consoles the amount of attenuation (or ‘dim’ as it is usually called in this context) is 
adjustable. 
 Figure 16.6: Talkback and oscillator system with routing to aux and group buses 

466 Chapter 16
 If the talkback microphone is mounted in the master panel, the distance between it and 
the engineer will vary as he moves. More sophisticated consoles sometimes incorporate a 
talkback compressor to reduce the level variations. 
 Many of the larger recording consoles include a ‘listen’ facility whereby the control-room can 
hear messages from the studio, even if no microphone channels are faded up. A microphone 
is mounted somewhere out of the way (often suspended from the ceiling) and is routed to the 
monitors when the ‘listen’ switch is pressed. 
 Most mixers of medium size and above incorporate a line-up oscillator which can be routed 
to all the groups and the stereo mix. This allows the mixer metering to be lined up with 
external level indication on the recorder. A fixed frequency oscillator running at 1 kHz with a 
variable output level is the minimum facility; more advanced models have switched or fully-
variable frequency controls. 
 In the typical talkback/oscillator system of  Figure 16.6 , the line-up oscillator is shown 
sharing with the talkback system the bank of mix resistors that inject signal into the buses. On 
a large console this is quite a lot of resistors, and it would not be sensible to design them in 
twice. The only compromise is that it is not possible to use talkback and the oscillator at the 
same time, but then why would you want to? The default selection is talkback, because this is 
used much more frequently than the oscillator. 
 The in-line channel module 
 Figure 16.7 shows a typical channel/group/monitor module for an in-line mixing console. 
This uses the first approach to in-line operation described above, where to enter mixdown 
mode the source of the channel path is switched to the track return rather than bodily moving 
the EQ and other facilities into the monitor path.  
 The group fader no longer appears. More usefully, the summing amplifier gain can be varied 
by a rotary ‘bus trim’ control to prevent overload; it is highly desirable that this control 
alters the gain of the actual summing amplifier, rather than having a low-gain summing 
amplifier with a level control and post amplifier following it, because the former gives greater 
protection against clipping and superior noise performance at low gain settings. The bus trim 
is rarely altered so it can be conveniently placed out of the way at the very top of the in-line 
module. The group signal from the summing amplifier is sent out to the recording machine, 
usually by means of a balanced or ground-cancelling output stage to prevent ground loops 
occurring with the multi-track recorder. The track return usually comes back via a balanced 
amplifier for the same reason. A track-return/group switch selects either the group or the 
track return signal for the metering and the monitor path; as shown in the figure this path 
consists of a monitor fader (the ‘short fader’) and a monitor panpot which send the signal to 

 Figure 16.7 : A channel/group/monitor module for an in-line recording console 

468 Chapter 16
the stereo mix bus to create a monitor mix. Note that every in-line module will have a meter, 
though it is not usual to provide meters for every channel on a split console. A monitor PFL 
switch is provided so that an individual track return or group can be conveniently listened to. 
 As in split consoles, it is convenient to connect the track return to the channel line input 
through normalling contacts on the line input jack, so switching to mixdown requires the 
minimum number of operations. As described earlier, in this form of in-line configuration 
the monitor path is redundant, as the channel fader and panpot are used to control the signal 
coming back from the multi-track recorder, and so there is usually a way in which the 
monitor path can be used as an extra effects return, as is commonly done in split consoles. 
Typically, the line input jack is used as the input connector for this purpose; alternatively an 
extra insert point may be provided in the monitor path, into which an external line signal can 
be fed. These arrangements are not shown in  Figure 16.7 , which is quite complicated enough 
already; it is one of the drawbacks of the in-line system that it is conceptually more complex 
than the split console format. 
 The auxiliary send system is slightly more complex in an in-line module, in the interests of 
maximum flexibility of working. In the example shown, the sends can be switched in pairs 
to take their signal either prefade or postfade from either the channel or monitor path. This is 
implemented by means of the switches SW3–SW8. For example, during recording the effect 
sends can be switched to be monitor postfade, allowing wet monitoring. Many variations on 
this aux send are possible; on larger consoles there will be six or eight sends, and sometimes 
a stereo aux send with its own panpot is provided.

 Microphone preampliﬁ ers 
 Microphone preampliﬁ er requirements 
 A microphone preamplifier is a serious design challenge. It must provide a gain variable from 
0 to 70 dB or more to amplify deafening drum-kits or discreet dulcimers, generate minimal 
internal noise, and have a high-CMRR balanced input to cancel noise pickup in long cables. 
It must also be able to withstand 48 V DC of phantom-power suddenly applied to its input 
while handling microvolt signals. 
 It is now rare to use input transformers to match a low-impedance (150–200 Ω) microphone 
to the preamplifier, since the cost and weight penalty is serious, especially when linearity at 
low frequencies and high levels is important. Both dynamic and capacitor microphones have 
a low output impedance of this order; the former because of the low number of turns used 
in the coil, the latter because active buffering of the extremely high capsule impedance is 
essential. 
 The low-noise requirement rules out the direct use of opamps, since their design involves 
compromises that make them at least 10 dB noisier than discrete transistors when faced with 
low source impedances. The answer, for at least the last 30 years, has been to use hybrid 
input stages that combine discrete input transistors to give low noise, combined with opamps 
to provide raw open-loop gain for linearisation, and load-driving capability. 
 To summarise the requirements of a microphone preamplifier: 
1.  Variable gain, usually from 0 to 70 dB. Some designs have a gain range extending to 
80 dB. The bottom 20 dB section of the range is often accessed by switching in a 20 dB 
input attenuator. 
2.  Minimal noise. Taking the source impedance of a microphone as 200 Ω, the Johnson 
noise from that resistance is 129.6 dBu at 25 °C, 20 kHz bandwidth. This puts an 
immediate limit on the noise performance; if you set up 70 dB of gain then the noise 
output from the preamplifier will be 59.6 dBu, even if it is itself completely noiseless. 
Most mic preamplifiers approach this at maximum gain, often having a noise figure as low 
as 1 or 2 dB, but depart from it further and further as gain is reduced. In other words, 

470 Chapter 17
the noise output does not fall as fast as it would if the preamp was noiseless, because 
reducing the gain means increasing the effective resistance of the gain control network, 
creating more Johnson noise. 
3.  The input must have a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) to reject interference 
and ground noise. The CMRR should ideally be high, be flat with frequency, and remain 
high as the input gain is altered over the whole range. In practice, CMRR tends to worsen 
as gain is reduced. Because of the need for a balanced input, microphone inputs are 
almost always female XLR connectors. 
4.  The input must have a constant resistive input impedance of 1 to 2 kΩ, which provides 
appropriate loading for a 200 Ω dynamic microphone capsule. This is also a suitable load 
for the internal head amplifiers of capacitor microphones. 
5.  The input must be proof against the sudden application (or removal) of 48 V DC phantom-
power. It must withstand this for many repeated cycles over the life of the equipment. 
 Transformer microphone inputs 
 For a long time transformer microphone inputs were the only real option. The cost and 
weight of a microphone input transformer for every channel is considerable, especially at 
the quality end of the market, because a large transformer core is needed to handle high 
levels at low frequency without distortion. Because of the low signal levels, mumetal 
screening cans were normally used to minimise magnetic interference, and this added to 
the cost and weight. 
 Step-up ratios from 1:5 to 1:10 were used, the higher ratios giving a better noise performance 
but more difficulties with frequency response because of the greater capacitance of a larger 
secondary winding. The impedance reflected to the input depends on the square of the 
step-up ratio, so with a 1:10 transformer the secondary had to be loaded with 100 kΩ to get 
the desired 1 kΩ at the primary input.  
 The arrangement in  Figure 17.1 has an amplifier gain range from to 0.3 to 60 dB to which is 
added 20 dB from the transformer ratio of 1:10, giving 20 to 80 dB of overall gain. R6 
in conjunction with the reverse-log pot shape the control law so it is roughly logarithmic. 
R4 is the 100 kΩ secondary loading resistor, and C1, R3 form a Zobel network to damp the 
secondary resonance. In the mid-Seventies, when opamps were still a dubious proposition 
for quality audio, the input amplifiers were very often discrete transistor stages using four or 
more transistors. Note R5, which prevents the gain from being reduced to exactly unity. Its 
presence is testimony to the fact that the discrete preamplifiers were difficult to stabilise at 
HF if the output and non-inverting input were directly connected together. R1 and R2 feed in 
phantom-power when the switch is in the ‘on’ position. 

Microphone preampliﬁ ers 471
 Microphone transformer technology had, and still has, its own advantages. A balanced input 
with a good and constant CMRR was inherent. The step-up ratio, which gave ‘gain for free’ 
in electronic if not financial terms, and the associated impedance matching, meant that it was 
easy to design a quiet input stage. Transformers also gave good RF rejection, and isolated the 
input preamplifier from phantom-power voltages. For EMC reasons in particular, transformer 
microphones continued in use in broadcast mixing consoles long after they had disappeared 
from recording and PA equipment. 
 The simple hybrid microphone preampliﬁ er 
 The cost incentive to develop an effective low-noise transformerless microphone input was 
considerable, and after much experimentation the arrangement shown in  Figure 17.2 became 
pretty much standard for some years, being extensively used in mixers around the period 
1978–1984 (in this period the more expensive consoles stuck to transformer microphone 
amplifiers). The difficulties of getting the noise low enough and the linearity good enough 
were at first formidable, but after a good deal of work (some of which I did) such stages 
became almost universal. Q1 and Q2 work as common-emitter stages, with the gain-control 
Figure 17.1: A transformer microphone preampliﬁ er. Gain range 20 to 80 dB

472 Chapter 17
network R5, RV1, C3 connected between the emitters. As the resistance of this network is 
reduced, the differential gain increases but the common-mode gain remains low. The two 
signals at the collectors are then summed by the opamp. This does not have to be a low-
noise type because the gain in the transistors means they determine the noise performance, 
and the TL072 was almost universally used in this position, being at the time much cheaper 
than the 5532. With appropriate choice of transistors (a type with low Rb) and collector 
current, preamplifiers of this type can give an equivalent input noise (EIN) of 128 dBu at 
maximum gain, equivalent to a noise figure of only 1.2 dB with a 200 Ω load. The EIN rises 
as gain is reduced, because the resistance of the gain-control network and its Johnson noise is 
increased. The noise output still falls as gain is reduced, but not as fast as the gain. 
 The gain law is very non-linear with Rg; a reverse-log D-law pot helps but there is still some 
cramping of the calibration at the high gain end, and preamplifier gain ranges of more than 
50 dB are not really practicable with this simple arrangement. 
 Today this approach is considered obsolete for anything except budget mixer purposes 
because of its mediocre distortion performance. You will note that the input transistor pair 
has no overall feedback loop closed around them, and their nonlinearity creates significant 
distortion, especially at high gains.  
 The two reverse-biased diodes in the transistor collector circuits are to prevent the opamp 
being damaged by having its input driven below the 17 V rail when phantom-power was 
applied or removed. Note that the input coupling capacitors C1, C2 shown here are not intended 
to cope with the phantom voltage if used. On arriving at the input XLR, the microphone 
signal first encounters the phantom feed resistors, DC blocking capacitors (usually rated at 
63 V), a switchable 20 dB attenuator, and possibly a phase-invert switch that swaps over the 
inputs, before it reaches the preamplifier (this is illustrated in   Figure 17.4 ).

 The balanced-feedback hybrid microphone preampliﬁ er (BFMA) 
 The microphone preamp architecture described in the previous section has the merit of 
simplicity, but because there is no global feedback loop around the input transistors its 
distortion performance falls far short of the rest of a mixer, which typically consists of pure 
opamp circuitry with very low distortion. It is obviously undesirable practically, aesthetically, 
and in every other way for the very first stage in the signal chain to irretrievably mess up 
the signal, but this is what happened for several years. In the mid-1980s I decided to do 
something about this. Many methods of applying feedback to the input stage were tried, 
but foundered on the fact that if feedback was applied to one of the transistors, the current 
variations in the other were excessive and created distortion. The use of two feedback paths 
in anti-phase, i.e. balanced feedback, was my solution to this problem; this meant that one 
feedback path would have to be via an inverting amplifier, with extra phase shifts that might 
imperil HF stability. 
 The basic concept is shown in  Figure 17.3 . Direct negative feedback to Q2 goes through 
R12, while the inverted feedback passes through the unity-gain inverting stage U1:B 
and goes through R11 to Q1. The gain-control network R5, RV1 and C3 is connected 
between the two feedback points at the Q1, Q2 emitters, and sets the closed-loop 
gain by controlling the NFB factor. Distortion is pretty much eliminated, even at 
maximum gain.  
Figure 17.3: The balanced feedback microphone ampliﬁ er, known to its friends as the BFMA

474 Chapter 17
 The solution to the stability problem is to make sure that the direct HF feedback through C10 
dominates that through C12, which has been through the inverter U1:A; this is aided by adding 
C4 to the inverter to control its HF response. This feedback is therefore not symmetrical at 
extreme HF, but this has no effect on the functioning of the circuit with audio signals.

(Equation 17.1)
 The closed-loop gain is given by Equation 17.1, which looks complicated, but becomes clearer 
when you appreciate that the terms in brackets simply represent the parallel combination of 
the emitter resistor Re (R1, R2 in the figure) and half the resistance of the gain control network 
Rg. Rnfb is the value of R11, R12. The 2 on the bottom comes from the fact that we are only 
using one output of the amplifier – there is an inverted output from the inverter which could be 
phase-summed to give twice the gain. We don’t do that because it is desirable to have as 
low a minimum gain as possible. With the values shown, the gain range is 22 to 71 dB, 
which in conjunction with a switchable 20 dB pad gives a useful total range of about 0 to 70 dB. 
 In order to get enough maximum gain with reasonable values for R5 and C3, the feedback 
resistors R11, R12 have to be quite high at 82 kΩ. This means that the control of the DC 
level at the output is not very good. To solve this, the DC servo integrator U2:A was added; 
R13 is connected to the preamplifier output and the integrator acts via the non-inverting 
input of the inverter opamp to keep the output at 0 V. 
 This technology was used on several consoles, such as the Soundcraft TS12, and later 
appeared in the Yamaha GA 24/12 and GA32/12 mixers in 1998 (a very sincere form of 
flattery). It had a relatively short life at Soundcraft as I came up with something better – the 
padless microphone preamplifier described later in this chapter. 
 Microphone and line input pads 
 Microphone pads, or attenuators, are used when the output is too high for the mixing console 
input to cope with; this typically happens when you put a microphone inside a kick-drum. 
Attenuators are also used when, for reasons of economy, it is desirable that the microphone 
input doubles up as a line input. 
 A typical arrangement is shown in  Figure 17.4 . The preamplifier has a typical gain range of 
20 to 70 dB. There is an input XLR and phantom feed resistors R1, R2. C1 and C2 are 
DC blocking capacitors to stop the phantom voltage from getting into the preamplifier; 
these should be as large as possible to preserve LF CMRR. Next comes a 20 dB balanced 
attenuator made up of R3–R6; note that the loading of the preamplifier input resistor 

Figure 17.4: Mic and line attenuators at the input of a preampliﬁ er

476 Chapter 17
R10 must be taken into account when designing the attenuator resistor values. One of the 
functions of this resistor is to prevent the preamplifier input from being open-circuited when 
the pad switch SW1 or the mic/line switch SW2 is between contacts. C3 and C4 are two 
further DC blocking capacitors, which prevent the input terminals of the preamplifier, which 
are not in general at 0 V, from causing clicks in the switching. C5, C6 and C7 increase EMC 
immunity and also keep the preamplifier from oscillating if the microphone input is left 
open-circuit at maximum gain. Such oscillation is not an indication that the preamplifier 
itself is unstable – it normally happens because the insert jacks, which carry the output 
signal from the preamplifier, are capacitively crosstalking to the microphone input, forming a 
feedback loop. Ideally the microphone input should be open-circuit stable not only with the input 
gain at maximum, but also with full treble boost set up on the EQ section. This can be challenging 
to achieve, but it is possible with careful attention to layout. I have done it many times.  
 In line mode, the microphone gain is, of course, much too high, and the usual practice is 
to use a 30 dB attenuator on the line input, which allows a high input impedance to be set 
by R7, R9 while R8 provides a low source impedance to minimise preamplifier noise. This 
pad alters the gain range to 10 to 40 dB, which is actually too wide for a line input, and 
some consoles have another switch section in the mic/line switch, which reduces the gain 
range of the preamplifier so that the overall range is a more useful 10 to 20 dB. The 
larger and more expensive consoles usually have separate line input stages which avoid the 
compromises inherent in using the microphone input as a line input. 
 There is an important point to be made about the two attenuators. You will have noticed that the 
microphone attenuator uses four resistors and has its centre connected to ground, whereas 
the line attenuator uses a more economical three resistors with no ground connection. The 
disadvantage of the three resistor version is that the wanted differential signal is attenuated, 
but the unwanted common-mode signal is not, and so the CMRR is much worsened. This 
does not happen with the four-resistor configuration because the ground connection means 
that both differential and common-mode signals are attenuated equally. There is no reason 
why the line attenuator here could not have been designed with four resistors – I just wanted 
to make the point. 
 The microphone amplifiers described have a high CMRR, and a problem with attenuators 
like this is that both types degrade the overall CMRR quite seriously because of their resistor 
tolerances, even if 1% components are used. 
 The padless microphone preampliﬁ er 
 The ideal microphone preamplifier would have a gain range of 70 dB or thereabouts on a 
single control, going down to unity gain without the inconvenience of a pad switch. It was 
mentioned in the previous section that resistive pads degrade the overall CMRR, and also the 

Microphone preampliﬁ ers 477
noise performance as an inevitable consequence of following a 20 dB pad with an amplifier 
having 20 dB of gain. In addition, space on a channel front panel is always in short supply 
and losing a switch would be very welcome. I therefore invented the padless microphone 
preamplifier. Looking at the mixer market today (2013), the idea seems to have caught on. 
 The concept is based on the balanced feedback mic amp described above, but now the total 
gain is spread over two stages to give a smooth 0–70 dB gain range with the rotation of a 
single knob. 
 The first stage shown in  Figure 17.5 is based on the BFMA circuit in  Figure 17.3 above, but 
with the feedback resistors reduced to 2k7 to reduce the gain range. The gain-control network 
R5, RV1 and C3 has also been halved in resistance to reduce Johnson noise, and the net result 
is a gain range of 1.5 to 49 dB; as before, a reverse-log D-law pot is used. The lower 
feedback resistors mean that no servo is required to correct the DC conditions. Note that the 
greater amount of NFB means that under overload conditions it is possible for the common-
mode range of the opamp to be exceeded, leading to the well-known TL072 phase reversal and 
latchup. This is prevented by R11, D3, and D4, which have no effect on linearity in normal 
operation.  
 The second stage of the padless mic amp is shown in  Figure 17.6 . This consists essentially of 
a variable-gain balanced input stage as described in  Chapter 18 , configured for a gain range 
of 0 to 20 dB. The gain pot is once again a reverse-log D-law pot and the combination of 
the gain laws of the two stages gives a very reasonable law over the almost 70 dB range, 
though there is still a little cramping at the high-gain end. 
Figure 17.5: The padless balanced feedback microphone preamp: mic input stage

478 Chapter 17
 The second stage is also used as a line-input stage with a gain range of 10 to 20 dB. 
The mic/line switching used to do this may look rather complex, but it does a bit more than 
simply change sources. In  Figure 17.6 , switch SW1 is shown in the ‘mic’ position, and the 
first stage reaches the inverting input of the second via SW1-B; the output of the mic amp is 
phase-inverted simply by swapping over its inputs. Line input resistors R1, R2 give reduced 
gain for line input working, and in mic mode they are shorted together by SW1-A to prevent 
crosstalk from line to mic, which is an important issue when track-normaling is incorporated 
(see  Chapter 16 ). In several of my designs these resistors were placed on the input connector 
PCB rather than in the channel, to keep their hot ends away from other circuitry and further 
reduce line to mic crosstalk. SW1-C shorts the junction of R1, R2 to ground, further 
improving mic/line crosstalk if the line input is not balanced. SW1-D shorts the unused 
second stage non-inverting input to ground. 
 In line mode, R1, R2 are connected to the second stage via SW1-B and SW1-C. In mic mode, 
SW1-D shorts R8 to ground so that the gain range of the second stage is increased to the 
required 30 dB. SW2 is a phase-invert switch which simply swaps over the input connections 
to the second stage.  
 The padless mic amp gives both a good gain control law and lower noise at low gain settings. 
The noise performance versus gain for a typical example can be seen in  Table 17.1 ; as 
described earlier, the EIN and noise figure worsen as the gain is turned down, due to the 
increased resistance of the gain network. A noise figure of 30 dB may appear to be pretty 
dire, but the corresponding noise output is only 98 dBu, and this will soon be submerged in 
the noise from following stages. 
Figure 17.6: The padless balanced feedback microphone preamp: mic/line switching and second 
stage

This effect can be reduced by reducing the impedance of the feedback and gain control 
network. This increases the power required to drive them, and because of the square-root in 
the Johnson noise equation, a reduction by a factor of ten, (which would need some serious 
electronics) would only give a 10 dB improvement, and that at the low gain end where it 
is least needed. Specialised outboard mic amps with low-resistance feedback networks, 
driven by what are in effect small power amplifiers, have been developed but do not seem 
to have caught on. 
 Another advantage of the padless approach is that one pair of DC blocking capacitors 
suffices, rated at 63 V as in  Figure 17.5 , and this improves the CMRR at low frequencies. The 
padless microphone preamplifier concept was protected by patent number  GB 2242089 in 
1991, and was used extensively over many ranges of mixing console. 
 Capacitor microphone head ampliﬁ ers 
 A capacitor capsule has an extremely high output impedance, equivalent to a very small 
capacitor of a few picoFarads. It is in fact the highest impedance you are ever likely to 
encounter in the audio business, and certainly the highest I have ever had to deal with. Special 
circuit techniques are required to combine low noise and high impedance, working with a 
strictly limited amount of power. A while ago I designed the electronics for a new capacitor 
microphone by one of the well-known manufacturers, and the circuitry described here is a 
somewhat simplified version of that. 
 The first point is that the microphone capsule had an impedance of about 5 pF, so to get a 
3 dB point of 10 Hz the total load impedance has to be no more than 3.2 GΩ. (yes, that’s 
3200 MΩ). The capsule needs to be fed with a polarising voltage through a resistor, and the

head amplifier needs a biasing resistor. In this design, both were 10 GΩ, which meant that 
the input impedance of the amplifier itself had to be not less than 8.9 GΩ. Resistors with 
these astronomical values are exotic components that come in a glass encapsulation that 
must be manipulated with tweezers – one touch of a finger and the insulation properties of 
the glass are fatally compromised. 
 Figure 17.7 shows my capacitor mic head amp. R1 supplies the capsule polarising voltage 
and R2 biases the first stage, a unity-gain JFET source-follower augmented by opamp 
U1:A which provides the gain for a high NFB factor to linearise Q1. The drain of Q1 is 
bootstrapped via C3 to prevent local feedback through the gate-drain capacitance of the JFET 
from reducing the input impedance. R3, R5, R6 set the DC conditions for Q1.  
 The second stage is a low-noise amplifier with gain of 4 dB, defined by the ratio of feedback 
resistor R17 to R15 and R16. Like the first stage, it is a hybrid design that combines the low 
noise of low-Rb transistor Q2 with the open-loop gain and load-driving capability of an opamp. 
 The stage also acts as a unity-gain follower making up a second order Butterworth Sallen and 
Key high-pass filter when C6, C7 or C8, C9 are switched in; the resistive elements are R10 
and R14. 
 The system has two steps of attenuation; 10 and 20 dB. The first 10 dB step is obtained 
by using SW1:B to take the output from the junction of R15 and R16 instead of the normal 
stage output. The second 10 dB step results from switching C2 across the mic capsule, 
forming a capacitive attenuator that reduces the input to the first stage and prevents 
overload. The gains available are thus 4 dB, 6 dB and 16 dB. The maximum sound 
pressure handling is 146 dB SPL, or 155 dB SPL with the 20 dB pad engaged. 
 The incoming phantom-power is tapped off by R20, R21 and fed to a discrete BJT regulator that 
gives 32 V to power the opamp, and 14 V to run a small LC oscillator that pumps the 32 V 
rail up to the 63 V required to polarise the capsule. Total current consumption is 2.2 mA .
 The noise output is 120.7 dBu (A-weighted), which may appear high compared with the 
microphone amplifiers described above, but remember that a capacitor microphone puts out a 
high signal voltage so that the S/N ratio is actually very good. The mic capsule, being a pure 
reactance, generates no noise of its own, and the noise output comes only from the Brownian 
motion of the air against the capsule diaphragm and from the electronics. A larger diameter 
capsule means lower noise because more energy is absorbed from the coherent sound waves; 
the same applies to the Brownian motion but this partially cancels, just as with the use of 
multiple opamps for low noise. 
 Noise measurement of this technology requires special methods. The impedances are so high 
that meaningful results can only be obtained by putting the circuitry inside a completely 
closed metal screening enclosure.

 Line inputs 
 External signal levels 
 There are several standards for line signal levels. The 10 dBu standard is used for a lot 
of semi-professional recording equipment as it gives more headroom with unbalanced 
connections – the professional levels of 4 dBu and 6 dBu assume balanced outputs which 
inherently give twice the output level for the same supply rails as it is measured between two 
pins with signals of opposite phase on them (see  Table 18.1 ). 
 Signal levels in dBu are expressed with reference to 0 dBu  775 mVrms; the origin of this 
odd value is that it gives a power of 1 mW in a purely historical 600 Ω load. The unit of 
dBv refers to the same level but takes the voltage as the reference rather than the power – a 
distinction of little interest nowadays. Signal in dBv (or dBV) are expressed with reference to 
0 dB  1.000 Vrms. 
 These standards are well established, but that does not mean all equipment follows them. To 
take a current example, the Yamaha P7000S power amplifier requires 8 dBu (1.95 Vrms) to 
give its full output of 750 W into 8 Ω. 
 Internal signal levels 
 In any audio system it is necessary to select a suitable nominal level for the signal passing 
through it. This level is always a compromise – the signal level should be high so it suffers 
minimal degradation by the addition of circuit noise as it passes through the system, but not 
so high that it is likely to suffer clipping before the gain control, or generate undue distortion

below the clipping level (this last constraint is not normally a problem with modern circuitry, 
which gives very low distortion right up to the clipping point). 
 It must always be considered that the gain control may be maladjusted by setting it too low 
and turning up the input level from the source equipment, making input clipping more likely. 
The internal levels chosen are usually in the range 6 to 0 dBu, (388 mV to 775 Vrms) 
but in some specialised equipment such as broadcast mixing consoles, where levels are 
unpredictable and clipping distortion less acceptable than a bit more noise, the nominal 
internal level may be as low as 16 dBu (123 mVrms). If the internal level is in the normal 
6 to 0 dBu range, and the maximum output of an opamp is taken as 9 Vrms, (21.3 dBu) 
this gives from 27 to 20 dB of headroom before clipping occurs. 
 If the incoming signal does have to be amplified, this should be done as early as possible 
in the signal path, to get the signal well above the noise floor. If the gain is implemented in 
the first stage (i.e. the input amplifier, balanced or otherwise) the signal will be able to pass 
through later stages, at a high level and so their noise contribution will be less significant. 
On the other hand, if the input stage is configured with a fixed gain, it will not be possible 
to turn it down to avoid clipping. Ideally the input stage should have variable gain. It is not 
straightforward to combine this feature with a balanced input, but several ways of doing it are 
shown later in this chapter. 
 Input ampliﬁ er functions 
 Firstly, RF filtering is applied at the very front end to prevent noise breakthrough and other 
EMC problems. It must be done before the incoming signal encounters any semiconductors 
where RF demodulation could occur, and can be regarded as a ‘roofing filter’. At the 
same time, the bandwidth at the low end is given an early limit by the use of DC-blocking 
capacitors, and in some cases overvoltage spikes are clamped by diodes. The input amplifier 
should present a reasonably high impedance to the outside world, not less than 10 kΩ, and 
preferably more. It must have a suitable gain – possibly switched or variable – to scale the 
incoming signal to the nominal internal level. Balanced input amplifiers also accurately 
perform the subtraction process that converts differential signals to single-ended ones, so 
noise produced by ground loops and the like is rejected. It’s quite a lot of work for one stage. 
 Unbalanced inputs 
 The simplest unbalanced input feeds the incoming signal directly to the first stage of the 
audio chain. This is often impractical; for example, if the first stage was a Baxandall tone-
control circuit then the boost and cut curves would be at the mercy of whatever source 
impedance was feeding the input. In addition, the input impedance would be low, and 

Line inputs 485
variable with frequency and control settings. Some sort of buffer amplifier which can be fed 
from a significant impedance without ill effect is needed. 
 Figure 18.1 shows an unbalanced input amplifier, with the added components needed for 
interfacing to the real world. The opamp U1:A acts as a unity-gain voltage follower; it can 
be easily altered to give gain by adding two series feedback resistors. A 5532 bipolar type 
is used here for low noise; with the low source impedances that are likely to be encountered 
here, an FET-input opamp would be 10 dB or more noisier. R1 and C1 are a first-order low-
pass filter to remove incoming RF before it has a chance to reach the opamp and demodulate 
into the audio band; once this has occurred any further attempts at RF filtering are of course 
pointless. R1 and C1 must be as close to the input socket as physically possible to prevent 
RF from being radiated inside the box before it is shunted to ground, and so come before all 
other components in the signal path. 
 Selecting component values for input filters of this sort is always a compromise, because 
the output impedance of the source equipment is not known. If the source is an active 
preamplifier stage, then the output impedance will probably be around 50 Ω, but it could 
be as high as 500 Ω or more. If the source is an oxymoronic ‘passive preamplifier’ – i.e. 
just an input selector switch and a volume potentiometer, then the output impedance will 
be a good deal higher (at least one passive preamplifier uses a transformer with switched 
taps for volume control – see  Chapter 13 ). If you really want to use a piece of equipment 
that embodies its internal contradictions in its very name, then a reasonable potentiometer 
value is 10 kΩ, and its maximum output impedance (when it is set for 6 dB of attenuation) 
will be 2.5 kΩ, which is very different from the 50 Ω we might expect from a good active 
preamplifier. This is in series with R1 and affects the turnover frequency of the RF filter. 
Effective RF filtering is very desirable, but it is also important to avoid a frequency response 
that sags significantly at 20 kHz. Valve equipment is also likely to have a high output 
impedance. 
 Figure 18.1: A typical unbalanced input ampliﬁ er with associated components 

486 Chapter 18
 Taking 2.5 kΩ as a worst-case source impedance and adding R1, then 2.6 kΩ and 100 pF 
together give us 3 dB at 612 kHz ; this gives a 20 kHz loss of only 0.005 dB, so possibly 
C1 could be usefully increased; for example, if we made it 220 pF then the 20 kHz loss is still 
only 0.022 dB, but the 3 dB point is 278 kHz, much improving the rejection of what used 
to be called ‘the medium wave’. If we stick with C1 at 100 pF and assume an active output 
with a 50 Ω impedance in the source equipment, then together with the 100 Ω resistance of 
R1 the total is 150 Ω, which in conjunction with 100 pF gives us 3 dB at 10.6 MHz. This is 
rather higher than desirable, but it is not easy to see what to do about it, and we must accept 
the compromise. If there was a consensus that the output impedance of a respectable piece of 
audio equipment should not exceed 100 Ω, then things would be much easier. 
 Our compromise seems reasonable, but can we rely on 2.5 kΩ as a worst case source 
impedance? I did a quick survey of the potentiometer values that passive preamplifiers 
currently employ, and while it confirmed that 10 kΩ seems to be the most popular value, 
one model had a 20 kΩ potentiometer, and another had a 100 kΩ pot. The latter would have 
a maximum output impedance of 25 kΩ, and would give very different results with a C1 
value of 100 pF – the worst-case frequency response would now be 3 dB at 63.4 kHz and 
0.41 dB at 20 kHz, which is not helpful if you are aiming for a ruler-flat response in the 
audio band. 
 To put this into perspective, filter capacitor C1 will almost certainly be smaller than the 
capacitance of the interconnecting cable. Audio interconnect capacitance is usually in the 
range 50 to 150 pF/metre, so with our assumed 2.5 kΩ source impedance and 150 pF/metre 
cable, and ignoring C1, you can only permit yourself a rather short run of 3.3 metres before 
you are 0.1 dB down at 20 kHz, while with a 25 kΩ source impedance you can hardly 
afford to have any cable at all; if you use low capacitance 50 pF/metre cable you might just 
get away with a metre. This is just one of many reasons why ‘passive preamplifiers’ really are 
 not a good idea. 
 Another important consideration is that the series resistance R1 must be kept as low as 
practicable to minimise Johnson noise; but lowering this resistance means increasing the 
value of shunt capacitor C1, and if it becomes too big then its impedance at high audio 
frequencies will become too low. Not only will there be too low a roll-off frequency if the 
source has a high output impedance, but there might be an increase in distortion at high audio 
frequencies because of excessive loading on the source output stage. 
 Replacing R1 with a small inductor to make an LC low-pass filter will give much better 
RF rejection at increased cost. This is justifiable in professional audio equipment, but it 
is much less common in hifi, one reason being that the unpredictable source impedance 
makes the filter design difficult, as we have just seen. In the professional world one  can  
assume that the source impedance will be low. Adding more capacitors and inductors allows 
a 3- or 4-pole LC filter to be made. If you do use inductors then it is essential to check 

Line inputs 487
the frequency response to make sure it is what you expect and there is no peaking at the 
turnover frequency. 
 C2 is a DC-blocking capacitor to prevent voltages from ill-conceived source equipment 
getting into the circuitry. It is a non-polarised type as voltages from the outside world are of 
unpredictable polarity, and it is rated at not less than 35 V so that even if it gets connected 
to defective equipment with an opamp output jammed hard against one of the supply rails, 
no harm will result. R3 is a DC drain resistor that prevents the charge put on C2 by the 
aforesaid external equipment from remaining there for a long time and causing a thud when 
connections are replugged; as with all input drain resistors, its value is a compromise between 
discharging the capacitor reasonably quickly, and keeping the input impedance acceptably 
high. The input impedance here is R3 in parallel with R2, i.e. 220 kΩ in parallel with 100 kΩ, 
giving 68 kΩ. This is a good high value and should work well with just about any source 
equipment you can find, including valve technology. 
 R2 provides the biasing for the opamp input; it must be a high value to keep the input 
impedance up, but bipolar input opamps draw significant input bias current. The Fairchild 
5532 data sheet quotes 200 nA typical, and 800 nA maximum, and these currents would 
give a voltage drop across R2 of 20 mV and 80 mV respectively. This offset voltage will 
be reproduced at the output of the opamp, with the input offset voltage added on; this is 
only 4 mV maximum and so will not affect the final voltage much, whatever its polarity. 
The 5532 has NPN input transistors, and the bias current flows into the input pins, so the 
voltage at Pin 3 and hence the output will be negative with respect to ground by anything 
up to 84 mV. 
 Such offset voltages are not so great that the output voltage swing of the opamp is 
significantly affected, but they are enough to generate unpleasant clicks and pops if the input 
stage is followed by any sort of switching, and enough to make potentiometers crackly. 
Output DC-blocking is therefore required in the shape of C3, while R4 is another DC drain 
resistor to keep the output at zero volts. It can be made rather lower in value than the input 
drain resistor R3 as the only requirement is that it should not significantly load the opamp 
output. FET-input opamps have much lower input bias currents, so that the offsets they 
generate as they flow through biasing resistors are usually negligible, but they still have input 
offsets of a few milliVolts, so DC-blocking will still be needed if switches downstream are to 
work silently. 
 This input stage, with its input terminated by 50 Ω to ground, has a noise output of only 
119.0 dBu over the usual 2222 kHz bandwidth. This is very quiet indeed, and is a 
reflection of the fact that R1, the only resistor in the signal path, has the low value of 100 Ω 
and so generates a very small amount of Johnson noise, only 132.6 dBu. This is swamped 
by the voltage noise of the opamp, which is basically all we see; its current noise has 
negligible effect because of the low circuit impedances.

 Balanced interconnections 
 Balanced inputs are used to prevent noise and crosstalk from affecting the input signal, especially 
in applications where long interconnections are used. They are standard on professional audio 
equipment, and are slowly but steadily becoming more common in the world of hifi. Their 
importance is that they can render ground loops and other connection imperfections harmless. 
Since there is no point in making a wonderful piece of equipment and then feeding it with an 
impaired signal, making an effective balanced input is of the first importance. 
 The basic principle of balanced interconnection is to get the signal you want by subtraction, 
using a three-wire connection. In some cases a balanced input is driven by a balanced output, 
with two anti-phase output signals; one signal wire (the hot or in-phase) sensing the in-phase 
output of the sending unit, while the other senses the anti-phase output. 
 In other cases, when a balanced input is driven by an unbalanced output, as shown in   Figure 18.2  , 
one signal wire (the hot or in-phase) senses the single output of the sending unit, while the other 
(the cold or phase-inverted) senses the unit's output-socket ground, and once again the difference 
between them gives the wanted signal. In either of these two cases, any noise voltages that appear 
identically on both lines (i.e. common-mode signals) are in theory completely cancelled by the 
subtraction. In real life the subtraction falls short of perfection, as the gains via the hot and cold 
inputs will not be precisely the same, and the degree of discrimination actually achieved is called 
the common-mode rejection ratio, of which more later. 
 It is deeply tedious to keep referring to non-inverting and inverting inputs, and so these are 
usually abbreviated to ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ respectively. This does  not necessarily mean that the 
hot terminal carries more signal voltage than the cold one. For a true balanced connection, the 
voltages will be equal. The ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ terminals are also often referred to as IN and 
IN, and this latter convention has been followed in the diagrams here. 
 The subject of balanced interconnections is a large one, and a big book could be written on 
this topic alone; one of the classic papers on the subject is by Muncy [1]. To make a start, let 
us look at the pros and cons of balanced connections. 
 Figure 18.2 : Unbalanced output to balanced input interconnection  

Line inputs 489
 The advantages of balanced interconnections 
 •  Balanced interconnections discriminate against noise and crosstalk, whether 
they result from ground currents, or electrostatic or magnetic coupling to signal 
conductors. 
 •  Balanced connections make ground-loops much less intrusive, and usually 
inaudible, so people are less tempted to start ‘lifting the ground’ to break the loop, 
with possibly fatal consequences. This tactic is only acceptable if the equipment 
has a dedicated ground-lift switch that leaves the external metalwork firmly 
connected to mains safety earth. In the absence of this switch the foolhardy and 
optimistic will break the mains earth (not quite so easy now that moulded mains 
plugs are standard) and this practice is of course highly dangerous, as a short-
circuit from mains to the equipment chassis will result in live metalwork but 
dead people. 
 •  A balanced interconnection incorporating a true balanced output gives 6 dB more 
signal level on the line, which should give 6 dB more dynamic range. However, 
this is true only with respect to  external noise – as is described later in this chapter, 
a standard balanced input using 10 kΩ resistors is about 14 dB noisier than the 
unbalanced input shown in  Figure 18.1 above. 
 •  Balanced connections are usually made with XLR connectors. These are a professional 
3-pin format, and are far superior to the phono (RCA) type normally used for 
unbalanced connections (there is more on this below). 
 The disadvantages of balanced interconnections 
 •  Balanced inputs are inherently noisier than unbalanced inputs by a large margin, in 
terms of the noise generated by the input circuitry itself rather than external noise. 
This may appear paradoxical but it is all too true, and the reasons will be fully 
explained in this chapter. 
 •  More hardware means more cost. Small-signal electronics is relatively cheap; unless 
you are using a sophisticated low-noise input stage, of which more later, most of the 
extra cost is likely to be in the balanced input connectors. 
 •  Balanced connections do not of themselves provide any greater RF immunity than an 
unbalanced input. For this to happen, both legs of the balanced input would have to 
demodulate the RF in equal measure for common-mode cancellation to occur. This is 
highly unlikely, and the chances of it happening over a wide frequency range are zero. 
It remains vital to provide the usual passive RF filtering in front of any electronics to 
avoid EMC troubles. 

490 Chapter 18
 •  There is the possibility of introducing a phase error. It is all too easy to create an 
unwanted phase inversion by confusing hot and cold when wiring up a connector, and 
this can go undiscovered for some time. The same mistake on an unbalanced system 
interrupts the audio completely and leaves no room for doubt. 
 Balanced cables and interference 
 In a balanced interconnection two wires carry the signal, and the third connection is the ground 
wire which has two functions. Firstly, it joins the grounds of the interconnected equipment 
together. This is not always desirable, and if galvanic isolation is required a transformer 
balancing system will be necessary because the large common-mode voltages are likely to 
exceed the range of an electronic balanced input. A good transformer will also have a very 
high CMRR, which will be needed to get a clean signal in the face of large CM voltages. 
 Secondly, the presence of the ground allows electrostatic screening of the two signal wires, 
preventing both the emission and pick-up of unwanted signals. This can mean: 
1.  A lapped screen, with wires laid parallel to the central signal conductor. The screening 
coverage is not total, and can be badly degraded as the screen tends to open up on the 
outside of cable bends. Not recommended unless cost is the dominating factor. 
2.  A braided screen around the central signal wires. This is much more expensive, as it is 
harder to make, but opens up less on bending than a lap screen. Even so, screening is not 
100%. It has to be said that it is a pain to terminate in the usual audio connectors. Not 
recommended. 
3.  An overlapping foil screen, with the ground wire (called the drain wire in this context for 
some reason) running down the inside of the foil and in electrical contact with it. This is 
usually the most effective as the foil is a solid sheet and cannot open up on the outside of 
bends. It should give perfect electrostatic screening, and it is much easier to work with 
than either lap screen or braided cable. However, the higher resistance of aluminium foil 
compared with copper braid means that RF immunity may not be so good. 
 There are three main ways in which an interconnection is susceptible to hum and noise: 
 1 Electrostatic coupling 
 An interfering signal at significant voltage couples directly to the inner signal line, through 
stray capacitance. The stray capacitance between imperfectly-screened conductors will be a 
fraction of a pF in most circumstances, as electrostatic coupling falls off with the square of 
distance. This form of coupling can be serious in studio installations with unrelated signals 
running down the same ducting. 

Line inputs 491
 The three main lines of defense against electrostatic coupling are effective screening, low 
impedance drive, and a good CMRR maintained up to the top of the audio spectrum. As 
regards screening, an overlapped foil screen provides complete protection. 
 Driving the line from a low impedance, of the order of 100 Ω or less, is also helpful because 
the interfering signal, having passed through a very small stray capacitance, is a very small 
current and cannot develop much voltage across such a low impedance. This is convenient 
because there are other reasons for using a low output impedance, such as optimising 
the interconnection CMRR, minimising HF losses due to cable capacitance, and driving 
multiple inputs without introducing gain errors. For the best immunity to crosstalk the output 
impedance must remain low up to as high a frequency as possible. This is definitely an 
issue as opamps invariably have a feedback factor that begins to fall from a low, and quite 
possibly sub-audio, frequency, and this makes the output impedance rise with frequency as 
the negative feedback factor falls, as if an inductor were in series. Some line outputs have 
physical series inductors to improve stability or EMC immunity, and these should not be so 
large that they significantly increase the output impedance at 20 kHz. From the point of view 
of electrostatic screening alone, the screen does not need to be grounded at both ends, or form 
part of a circuit [2]. It must of course be grounded at some point. 
 If the screening is imperfect, and the line impedance non-zero, some of the interfering signal 
will get into the hot and cold conductors, and now the CMRR must be relied upon to make 
the immunity acceptable. If it is possible, rearranging the cable-run away from the source 
of interference and getting some properly screened cable is more practical and more cost-
effective than relying on very good common-mode rejection. 
 Stereo hifi balanced interconnections almost invariably use XLR connectors. Since an XLR 
can only handle one balanced channel, two separate cables are almost invariably used and 
interchannel capacitive crosstalk is not an issue. Professional systems, on the other hand, use 
multi-way connectors that do not have screening between the pins and there is an opportunity 
for capacitive crosstalk here, but the use of low source impedances should reduce it to below 
the noise floor. 
 2 Magnetic coupling 
 If a cable runs through an AC magnetic field, an EMF is induced in both signal conductors 
and the screen, and, according to some writers, the screen current must be allowed to flow 
freely or its magnetic field will not cancel out the field acting on the signal conductors, 
and therefore the screen should be grounded at both ends, to form a circuit [3]. In practice 
the magnetic field cancellation will be very imperfect and reliance is better placed on the 
CMRR of the balanced system to cancel out the hopefully equal voltages induced in the two 
signal wires. The need to ground both ends to possibly optimise the magnetic rejection is 

492 Chapter 18
not usually a restriction, as it is rare that galvanic isolation is required between two pieces of 
audio equipment. 
 The equality of the induced voltages can be maximised by minimising the loop area between 
the hot and cold signal wires, for example by twisting them tightly together in manufacture. 
In practice most audio foil-screen cables have parallel rather than twisted signal conductors, 
but this seems adequate almost all of the time. Magnetic coupling falls off with the square of 
distance, so rearranging the cable-run away from the source of magnetic field is usually all 
that is required. It is unusual for it to present serious difficulties in a hifi application. 
 3 Ground voltages 
 These are the result of current flowing through the ground connection, and is often called 
‘common-impedance coupling’ in the literature [1]. This is the root of most ground-loop 
problems. The existence of a loop in itself does no harm, but it is invariably immersed in a 
50 Hz magnetic field that induces mains-frequency currents plus harmonics into it. This current 
produces a voltage drop down non-negligible ground-wire resistances, and this effectively 
appears as a voltage source in each of the two signal lines. Since the CMRR is finite a 
proportion of this voltage will appear to be a differential signal, and will be reproduced as such. 
 Balanced connectors 
 Balanced connections are most commonly made with XLR connectors, though it can be done 
with stereo (tip-ring-sleeve) jack plugs. XLRs are a professional 3-pin format, and are a much 
better connector in every way than the usual phono (RCA) connectors used for unbalanced 
interconnections. Phono connectors have the great disadvantage that if you are connecting 
them with the system active (inadvisable, but then people are always doing inadvisable 
things) the signal contacts meet before the grounds and thunderous noises result. The XLR 
standard has Pin 2 as hot, Pin 3 as cold, and Pin 1 as ground. 
 Stereo jack plugs are often used for line level signals in a recording environment, and are 
frequently found on the rear of professional power amplifiers as an alternative to an adjacent 
XLR connector. Both full-size and 3.5 mm sizes are used. Balanced jacks are wired with the 
tip as hot, the ring as cold, and the sleeve as ground. Sound reinforcement systems often use 
large multiway connectors that carry dozens of 3-wire balanced connections. 
 Balanced signal levels 
 Many pieces of equipment, including preamplifiers and power amplifiers designed to work 
together, have both unbalanced and balanced inputs and outputs. The general consensus in 
the hifi world is that if the unbalanced output is say 1 Vrms, then the balanced output will 

Line inputs 493
be created by feeding the in-phase output to the hot output pin, and also to a unity-gain 
inverting stage, which drives the cold output pin with 1 Vrms phase-inverted. The total 
balanced output voltage between hot and cold pins is therefore 2 Vrms, and so the balanced 
input must have a gain of ½ or 6 dB relative to the unbalanced input to maintain consistent 
internal signal levels. 
 Electronic vs transformer balanced inputs 
 Balanced interconnections can be made using either transformer or electronic balancing. 
Electronic balancing has many advantages, such as low cost, low size and weight, superior 
frequency and transient response, and no low-frequency linearity problems. It may still 
be regarded as a second-best solution in some quarters, but the performance is more than 
adequate for most professional applications. Transformer balancing does have some 
advantages of its own, particularly for work in very hostile RF/EMC environments, but 
serious drawbacks. The advantages are that transformers are electrically bullet-proof, 
retain their high CMRR performance forever, and consume no power even at high signal 
levels. They are essential if galvanic isolation between ground is required. Unfortunately, 
transformers generate LF distortion, particularly if they have been made with minimal core 
sizes to save weight and cost. They are liable to have HF response problems due to leakage 
reactance and distributed capacitance, and compensating for this requires a carefully designed 
Zobel network across the secondary. Inevitably they are heavy and expensive. Transformer 
balancing is therefore relatively rare, even in professional audio applications, and the greater 
part of this chapter deals with electronically-balanced inputs. 
 Common mode rejection 
 Figure 18.3 shows a balanced interconnection reduced to its bare essentials; hot and cold 
line outputs with source resistances R out , R out and a standard differential amplifier at the 
input end. The output resistances are assumed to be exactly equal, and the balanced input 
in the receiving equipment has two exactly equal input resistances to ground R1, R2. The 
ideal balanced input amplifier senses the voltage difference between the points marked IN 
(hot) and IN (cold) and ignores any common-mode voltage which are present on both. The 
amount by which it discriminates is called the common-mode rejection ratio or CMRR, and 
is usually measured in dB. Suppose a differential voltage input between IN and IN gives 
an output voltage of 0 dB; now reconnect the input so that IN and IN are joined together 
and the same voltage is applied between them and ground. Ideally the result would be zero 
output, but in this imperfect world it won’t be, and the output could be anywhere between 
20 dB (for a bad balanced interconnection, which probably has something wrong with it) 
and 140 dB (for an extremely good one). The CMRR when plotted may have a flat section 

494 Chapter 18
at low frequencies, but it very commonly degrades at high audio frequencies, and may also 
deteriorate at very low frequencies. More on that later. 
 In one respect balanced audio connections have it easy. The common-mode signal is normally 
well below the level of the unwanted signal, and so the common-mode range of the input is 
not an issue. In other areas of technology, such as electrocardiogram amplifiers, the common-
mode signal may be many times greater than the wanted signal. 
 The simplified conceptual circuit of  Figure 18.3 , under SPICE simulation, demonstrates the need 
to get the resistor values right for a good CMRR, before you even begin to consider the rest of 
the circuitry. The differential voltage sources V out , V out which represent the actual balanced 
output are set to zero, and V cm , which represents the common-mode voltage drop down the cable 
ground, is set to 1 volt to give a convenient result in dBV. The output resulting from the presence 
of this voltage source is measured by a mathematical subtraction of the voltages at IN and IN 
so there is no actual input amplifier to confuse the results with its non-ideal performance. 
 Let us begin with R out and R out set to 100 Ω and R1 and R2 set to 10 kΩ. These are 
typical real-life values as well as being nice round figures. When all four resistances are 
exactly at their nominal value, the CMRR is in theory infinite, which my SPICE simulator 
rather curiously reports as exactly 400 dB. If one of the output resistors or one of the input 
resistors is then altered in value by 1%, then the CMRR drops like a stone to 80 dB. If 
the deviation from equality is 10%, things are predictably worse and the CMRR degrades 
to 60 dB, as shown in  Table 18.2 . That would be quite a good figure in reality, but since 
we have not yet even thought about opamp imperfections or other circuit imbalances, and 
have only altered one resistance out of the four that will in real circuitry all have their own 
tolerances, it underlines the need to get things right at the most basic theoretical level before 
we dig deeper into the circuitry. The CMRR is naturally flat with frequency because our 
simple model has no frequency-dependent components.

inﬂ uence CMRR  

Line inputs 495
 The essence of the problem is that we have two resistive dividers, and to get an infinite 
CMRR they must have exactly the same attenuation. If we increase the ratio between the 
output and input resistors, by reducing the former or increasing the latter, the attenuation 
factor becomes closer to unity, so variations in either resistor value have less effect on it. If 
we increase the input impedance to 100 kΩ, which is quite practical in real life (we will put 
aside the noise implications of this for the moment) things are ten times better, as the Rin/
Rout
 ratio has improved from 100 to 1000 times. We now get a CMRR of 100 dB with a 
1% resistance deviation, and 80 dB with a 10% deviation. An even higher input impedance 
of 1 MΩ, which is perhaps a bit less practical, raises Rin/Rout
 to 10,000 and gives 120 dB 
for a 1% resistance deviation, and 100 dB for a 10% deviation. 
 We can attack the other aspect of the attenuation problem by reducing the output impedances 
to 10 Ω, ignoring for the moment the need to secure against HF instability caused by cable 
capacitance, and also return the input impedance resistors to 100 kΩ. Rin/Rout is 10,000 
once more, and as you might suspect the CMRR is once more 120 dB for a 1% deviation, 
and 100 dB for a 10% deviation. Ways to make stable output stages with very low output 
impedances are described in  Chapter 19 ; a fraction of an Ohm at 1 kHz is quite easy to achieve. 
 In conventional circuits, the combination of 68 Ω output resistors and a 20 kΩ input 
impedance is often encountered; 68 Ω is about as low as you want to go if HF instability

is to be absolutely guarded against with the long lines used in professional audio. The 
20 kΩ common-mode input impedance is what you get if you make a basic balanced input 
amplifier with four 10 kΩ resistors. I strongly suspect that this value is so popular because 
it looks as if it gives standard 10 kΩ input impedances – in fact it does nothing of the sort, 
and the common-mode input impedance, which is what matters here, is 20 kΩ on each 
leg; more on that later. It turns out that 68 Ω output resistors and a 20 kΩ input impedance 
give a theoretical CMRR of 89.5 dB for a 1% deviation of one resistor, which is quite 
encouraging. These results are summarised in  Table 18.2. 
 The conclusion is simple: we need the lowest possible output impedances and the highest 
possible input impedances to get the maximum common-mode rejection. This is highly 
convenient because low output impedances are already needed to drive multiple amplifier 
inputs and cable capacitance, and high input impedances are needed to minimise loading and 
maximise the number of amplifiers that can be driven. 
 The basic electronic balanced input 
 Figure 18.4 shows the basic balanced input amplifier using a single opamp. To achieve balance 
R1 must be equal to R3 and R2 equal to R4. It has a gain of R2/R1 (R4/R3). The standard one-
opamp balanced input or differential amplifier is a very familiar circuit block, but its operation 
often appears somewhat mysterious. Its input impedances are not equal when it is driven from a 
balanced output; this has often been commented on [4], and some confusion has resulted. 
 The source of the confusion is that a simple differential amplifier has interaction between the 
two inputs, so that the input impedance seen on the cold input depends on the signal applied 
to the hot input. Input impedance is measured by applying a signal and seeing how much 
current flows into the input, so it follows that the apparent input impedance on each leg varies 
according to how the cold input is driven. If the amplifier is made with four 10 kΩ resistors, 
then the input impedances on hot and cold are as  Table 18.3. 
 Figure 18.4 : The basic balanced input ampliﬁ er  

Line inputs 497
 Some of these impedances are not exactly what you might expect, and require some explanation. 
 Case 1: The balanced input is being used as an unbalanced input by grounding the cold input 
and driving the hot input only. The input impedance is therefore simply R3  R4. Resistors 
R3 and R4 reduce the signal by a factor of a half, but this loss is undone as R1 and R2 set 
the amplifier gain to two times, and the overall gain is unity. If the cold input is not grounded 
then the gain is 0.5 times. The attenuate-then-amplify architecture, plus the Johnson noise 
from the resistors, makes this configuration much noisier than the dedicated unbalanced input 
of  Figure 18.1 , which has only a single 100 Ω resistor in the signal path. 
 Case 2: The balanced input is again being used as an unbalanced input, but this time by 
grounding the hot input, and driving the cold input only. This gives a phase inversion and 
it is unlikely you would want to do it except as an emergency measure to correct a phase 
error somewhere else. The important point here is that the input impedance is now only 10 kΩ, 
the value of R1, because shunt negative feedback through R2 creates a virtual earth at Pin 
2 of the opamp. Clearly this simple circuit is not as symmetrical as it looks. The gain is 
unity, whether or not the hot input is grounded; grounding it is desirable because it not 
only prevents interference being picked up on the hot input pin, but also puts R3 and R4 in 
parallel, reducing the resistance from opamp Pin 3 to ground and so reducing Johnson noise. 
 Case 3: This is the standard balanced interconnection. The input is driven from a balanced 
output with the same signal levels on hot and cold, as if from a transformer with its centre-tap 
grounded, or an electronically balanced output using a simple inverter to drive the cold pin. 
The input impedance on the hot input is what you would expect; R3  R4 add up to 20 kΩ. 
However, on the cold input there is a much lower input impedance of 6.66 kΩ. This at first 
sounds impossible as the first thing the signal encounters is a 10 kΩ series resistor, but the 
crucial point is that the hot input is being driven simultaneously with a signal of the opposite 
phase, so the inverting opamp input is moving in the opposite direction to the cold input 
due to negative feedback, and what you might call anti-bootstrapping reduces the effective 
value of the 10 kΩ resistor to 6.66 kΩ. These are the differential input impedances we are 
examining, the impedances seen by the balanced output driving them. Common-mode signals 
see a common-mode impedance of 20 kΩ, as in Case 4 below.

 You will sometimes see the statement that these unequal differential input impedances 
‘unbalance the line’. From the point of view of CMRR, this is not the case, as it is the CM 
input impedance that counts. The line is, however, unbalanced in the sense that the cold input 
draws three times the current from the output that the hot one does. This current imbalance 
might conceivably lead to inductive crosstalk in some multi-way cable situations, but I have 
never encountered it. The differential input impedances can be made equal by increasing 
the R1 and R2 resistor values by a factor of three, but this degrades the noise performance 
markedly and makes the common-mode impedances to ground unequal, which is a much 
worse situation as it compromises the rejection of ground voltages, and these are almost 
always the main problem in real life. 
 Case 4: Here both inputs are driven by the same signal, representing the existence of a 
common-mode voltage. Now both inputs show an impedance of 20 kΩ. It is the symmetry 
of the common-mode input impedances that determines how effectively the balanced input 
rejects the common-mode signal. This configuration is of course only used for CMRR testing. 
 Case 5: Now the input is driven as from a floating transformer with the centre-tap (if any) 
unconnected, and the impedances can be regarded as equal; they must be, because with a 
floating winding the same current must flow into each input. However, in this connection 
the line voltages are  not equal and opposite: with a true floating transformer winding the 
hot input has all the signal voltage on it while the cold has none at all, due to the negative 
feedback action of the balanced input amplifier. This seemed very strange when it emerged in 
SPICE simulation, but a sanity check with real components proves it true. The line has been 
completely unbalanced as regards crosstalk to other lines, although its own common-mode 
rejection remains good. 
 Even if absolutely accurate resistors are assumed, the CMRR of the stage in  Figure 18.4 is 
not infinite; with a TL072 it is about 90 dB, degrading from 100 Hz upwards, due to the 
limited open-loop gain of the opamp. We will now examine this effect. 
 Common-mode rejection: the basic balanced 
input and opamp effects 
 In the earlier section on CMRR we saw that in a theoretical balanced line, choosing low 
output impedances and high input impedances would give very good CM rejection even if 
the resistors were not perfectly matched. Things are a bit more complex (i.e. worse) if we 
replace the mathematical subtraction with a real opamp. We quickly find that even if perfectly 
matched resistors everywhere are assumed, the CMRR of the stage is not infinite, because the 
two opamp inputs are not at exactly the same voltage. The negative feedback error-voltage 
between the inputs depends on the open-loop gain of the opamp, and that is neither infinite 
nor flat with frequency into the far ultra-violet. Far from it. There is also the fact that opamps 
themselves have a common-mode rejection ratio; it is high, but once more it is not infinite. 

Line inputs 499
 As usual, SPICE simulation is instructive, and  Figure 18.5 shows a simple balanced 
interconnection, with the balanced output represented simply by two 100 Ω output resistances 
connected to the source equipment ground, here called Ground 1, and the usual differential 
opamp configuration at the input end, where we have Ground 2. 
 A common-mode voltage V cm is now injected between Ground 1 and Ground 2, and the 
signal between the opamp output and Ground 2 measured. The balanced input amplifier 
has all four of its resistances set to precisely 10 kΩ, and the opamp is represented by a very 
simple model that has only two parameters; a low-frequency open-loop gain, and a single 
pole frequency that says where that gain begins to roll-off at 6 dB per octave. The opamp 
input impedances and the opamp’s own CMRR are assumed infinite, as in the world of 
simulation they so easily can be. Its output impedance is set at zero. 
 For the first experiments, even the pole frequency is made infinite, so now the only contact 
with harsh reality is that the opamp open-loop gain is finite. That is however enough to give 
distinctly non-ideal CMRR figures, as  Table 18.4 shows.

 With a low-frequency open-loop gain of 100,000, which happens to be the typical figure for 
a 5532 opamp, even perfect components everywhere will never yield a better CMRR than 
94 dB. The CMRR is shown as a raw ratio in the third column so you can see that the 
CMRR is inversely proportional to the gain, and so we want as much gain as possible. 
 Opamp frequency response effects 
 To examine these we will set the low-frequency gain to 100,000 which gives a CMRR ‘floor’ of 
94 dB, and then introduce the pole frequency that determines where it rolls-off. The CMRR 
now worsens at 6 dB/octave, starting at a frequency set by the interaction of the low-frequency 
gain and the pole frequency. The results are summarised in  Table 18.5 which shows that as 
you might expect, the lower the open-loop bandwidth of the opamp, the lower the frequency at 
which the CMRR begins to fall off.  Figure 18.6 shows the situation diagrammatically. 
 Table 18.6 gives the open-loop gain and pole parameters for a few opamps of interest. Both 
parameters, but especially the gain, are subject to considerable variation; the typical values 
from the manufacturers’ data sheets are given here.

 Some of these opamps have very high open-loop gains, but only at very low frequencies. 
This may be good for DC applications, but in audio line input applications, where the lowest 
frequency of CMRR interest is 50 Hz, they will be operating above the pole frequency and 
so the gain available will be less – possibly considerably so, in the case of opamps like the 
OPA2134. This is not however a real limitation, for even if a humble TL072 is used the 
perfect-resistor CMRR is about 90 dB, degrading from 100 Hz upwards. This sort of 
performance is not attainable in practice. We will shortly see why not. 
 Opamp CMRR effects 
 Opamps have their own common-mode rejection ratio, and we need to know how much this 
will affect the final CMRR of the balanced interconnection. The answer is that if all resistors 
are accurate, the overall CMRR is equal to the CMRR of the opamp [5]. Since opamp CMRR 
is typically very high (see the examples in  Table 18.6 ) it is very unlikely to be the limiting 
factor. 
 The CMRR of an opamp begins to degrade above a certain frequency, typically at 6 dB per 
octave. This is (fortunately) at a higher frequency than the open-loop pole, and is frequently 
around 1 kHz. For example the OP27 has a pole frequency at about 3 Hz, but the CMRR 
remains flat at 120 dB until 2 kHz, and it is still greater than 100 dB at 20 kHz. 
 Ampliﬁ er component mismatch effects 
 We saw earlier in this chapter that when the output and input impedances on a balanced line 
have a high ratio between them and are accurately matched we got a very good CMRR; this 
was compromised by the imperfections of opamps, but the overall results were still very 
good – and much higher than the CMRRs measured in practice. There remains one place 
where we are still away in theory-land; we have so far assumed the resistances around the

opamp were all exactly accurate. We must now face reality, admit that these resistors will not 
be perfect, and see how much damage to the CMRR they will do. 
 SPICE simulation gives us  Table 18.7 . The situation with LF opamp gains of both 100,000 
and 1,000,000 is examined, but the effects of finite opamp bandwidth or opamp CMRR are 
not included. R1 in  Figure 18.5 is varied while R2, R3 and R4 are all kept at precisely 10 kΩ, 
and the balanced output source impedances are set to exactly 100 Ω. 
 Table 18.7 shows with glaring clarity that our previous investigations, which took only output 
and input impedances into account, and determined that 68 Ω output resistors and 20 kΩ 
input impedances gave a CMRR of 89.5 dB for a 1% deviation in either, were actually quite 
unrealistic, and even adding in opamp imperfections left us with unduly optimistic results. 
If a 1% tolerance resistor is used for R1, (and nowadays there is no financial incentive to 
use anything less accurate) the CMRR is dragged down at once to 46 dB; the same figure 
results from varying any other one of the four resistances by itself. If you are prepared to 
shell out for 0.1% tolerance resistors, the CMRR is a rather better 66 dB. 
 This shows that there really is no point in worrying about the gain of the opamp you use in 
balanced inputs; the effect of mismatches in the resistors around that opamp are far greater. 
 The results in the table give an illustration of how resistor accuracy affects CMRR, but it is 
only an illustration, because in real life – a phrase that seems to keep cropping up, showing 
how many factors affect a practical balanced interconnection – all four resistors will of 
course be subject to a tolerance, and a more realistic calculation would produce a statistical 
distribution of CMRR rather than a single figure. One method is to use the Monte Carlo 
function in SPICE, which runs multiple simulations with random component variations and

collates the results. However you do it, you must know (or assume) how the resistor values 
are distributed within their tolerance window. Usually you don’t know, and finding out by 
measuring hundreds of resistors is not a task that appeals to all of us. 
 It is straightforward to assess the worst-case CMRR, which occurs when all resistors are at 
the limit of the tolerance in the most unfavourable direction. The CMRR in dB is then: 
 
CMRR  20log  1  R2/R1
⎞
⎟⎠
⎞
⎟⎠
4T/100
 
(Eqution 18.1) 
 Where R1 and R2 are as in  Figure 18.5 , and T is the tolerance in %. 
 This deeply pessimistic equation tells us that 1% resistors give a worst-case CMRR of only 
34.0 dB, that 0.5% parts give only 40.0 dB and expensive 0.1% parts yield but 54.0 dB. 
Things are not however quite that bad in actuality, as the chance of everything being as wrong 
as possible is actually very small. I have measured the CMRR of more of these balanced 
inputs, built with 1% resistors, than I care to contemplate, but I do not ever recall that I ever 
saw one with an LF CMRR worse than 40 dB. 
 There are 8-pin SIL packages that offer four resistors that ought to have good matching, if 
not accurate absolute values; be very, very wary of these as they usually contain thick-
film resistive elements that are not perfectly linear. In a test I did a 10 kΩ SIL resistor with 
10 Vrms across it generated 0.0010% distortion. Not a huge amount perhaps, but in the quest 
for perfect audio, resistors that do not stick to Ohm’s Law are not a good start. 
 To conclude this section, it is clear that in practical use it is the errors in the balanced amplifier 
resistors that determine the CMRR, though both unbalanced capacitances (C1, C2 in  Figure 18.9  
below) and the finite opamp bandwidth are likely to cause further degradation at high audio 
frequencies. If you are designing both ends of a balanced interconnection and you are 
spending money on precision resistors, you should put them in the input amplifier, not the 
balanced output. The LF gain of the opamp, and opamp CMRR, have virtually no effect. 
 Balanced input amplifiers made with four 1% resistors are used extensively in the 
professional audio business, and almost always prove to have adequate CMRR for the job. 
When more CMRR is thought desirable, for example in high-end mixing consoles, one of the 
resistances is made trimmable with a preset, as in  Figure 18.7 . This means a bit of tweaking 
in manufacture, but the upside is that it is a quick set-and-forget adjustment that will not need 
to be touched again unless one of the four resistors needs replacing, and that is extremely 
unlikely. CMRRs at LF of more than 80 dB can easily be obtained by this method, but the 
CMRR at HF will degrade due to the opamp gain roll-off and stray capacitances. 
 Figure 18.8 shows the CMRR measurements for a trimmed balanced input amplifier. The 
flat line at 50 dB was obtained from a standard fixed-resistor balanced input using four 
1% 10 kΩ unselected resistors, while the much better (at LF, anyway) trace going down to

CMRR up to 500 Hz 

Line inputs 505
85 dB was obtained from  Figure 18.7 by using a multi-turn preset for PR1. Note that R4 is 
an E96 value so a 1k preset can swing the total resistance of that arm both above and below 
the nominal 10 kΩ. The CMRR is dramatically improved by more than 30 dB in the region 
50–500 Hz where ground noise tends to intrude itself, and is significantly better across almost 
all the audio spectrum. 
 The upward sloping part of the trace in  Figure 18.8 is partly due to the finite open-loop 
bandwidth of the opamp, and partly due to unbalanced circuit capacitances. The CMRR is 
actually worse than 50 dB above 20 kHz, due to the stray capacitances in the multi-turn preset. 
In practice the value of PR1 would be smaller, and a one-turn preset with much less stray 
capacitance used. Still, I think you get the point: trimming can be both economic and effective. 
 The only thing that could go wrong here is that vibration might affect preset adjustments in 
on-the-road mixing consoles. This can be prevented by using good quality parts; multi-turn 
presets stay where they are put, but as noted their stray capacitance can be a problem and they 
are relatively expensive parts to apply to every line input. 
 A practical balanced input 
 The simple balanced input circuit shown in  Figure 18.4 is not fit to face the outside world 
without additional components.  Figure 18.9 shows a fully equipped version. Firstly, and most 
important, C1 has been added across the feedback resistor R2; this prevents stray capacitances 
from Pin 2 to ground causing extra phase-shifts that lead to HF instability. The value required 
for stability is small, much less than that which would cause an HF roll-off anywhere near the 
 Figure 18.9:  Balanced input ampliﬁ er with the extra components required for DC blocking and 
EMC immunity 

506 Chapter 18
top of the audio band. The values here of 10k and 27 pF give 3 dB at 589 kHz, and such a 
roll-off is only down by 0.005 dB at 20 kHz. C2, of equal value, must be added across R4 to 
maintain the balance of the amplifier, and hence its CMRR, at high frequencies. 
 C1 and C2 must not be relied upon for EMC immunity as C1 is not connected to ground, 
and there is every chance that RF will demodulate at the opamp inputs. A passive RF filter is 
therefore added to each input, in the shape of R5, C3 and R6, C4, so the capacitors will shunt 
incoming RF to ground before it reaches the opamp. Put these as close to the input socket as 
possible to minimise radiation inside the enclosure. 
 I explained earlier in this chapter when looking at unbalanced inputs that it is not easy to guess 
what the maximum source impedance will be, given the existence of ‘passive preamplifiers’ 
and valve equipment. Neither is likely to have a balanced output, unless implemented by a 
transformer, but either might be used to feed a balanced input, and so the matter needs thought. 
 In the unbalanced input circuit resistances had to be kept as low as practicable to minimise 
the generation of Johnson noise that would compromise the inherently low noise of the stage. 
The situation with a standard balanced input is however different from the unbalanced case 
as there have to be resistances around the opamp, and they must be kept up to a certain value 
to give acceptably high input impedances; this is why a balanced input like this one is much 
noisier. We could therefore make R5 and R6 much larger without a measurable noise penalty 
if we reduce R1 and R3 accordingly to keep unity gain. In  Figure 18.9 R5 and R6 are kept at 
100 Ω, so if we assume 50 Ω output resistances in both legs of the source equipment, then 
we have a total of 150 Ω, and 150 Ω and 100 pF give 3 dB at 10.6 MHz. Returning to a 
possible passive preamplifier with a 10 kΩ potentiometer, its maximum output impedance 
of 2.5k plus 100 Ω with 100 pF gives 3 dB at 612 kHz, which remains well clear of the 
top of the audio band. 
 As with the unbalanced input, replacing R5 and R6 with small inductors will give much better 
RF filtering but at increased cost. Ideally a common-mode choke (two bifilar windings on a small 
toroidal core) should be used as this improves performance. Check the frequency response to 
make sure the LC circuits are well-damped and not peaking at the turnover frequency. 
 C5 and C6 are DC-blocking capacitors. They must be rated at no less than 35 V to protect 
the input circuitry, and are the non-polarised type as external voltages are of unpredictable 
polarity. The lowest input impedance that can occur with this circuit when using 10 kΩ 
resistors, is, as described above, 6.66 kΩ when it is being driven in the balanced mode. The 
low-frequency roll-off is therefore 3 dB at 0.51 Hz. This may appear to be undesirably 
low, but the important point is not the LF roll-off but the possible loss of CMRR at low 
frequencies due to imbalance in the values of C5 and C6; they are electrolytics with a 
significant tolerance. Therefore they should be made large so their impedance is a small 
part of the total input impedance. 47 μF is shown here but 100 μF or 220 μF can be used 
to advantage if there is the space to fit them in. The low-end frequency response must be 

Line inputs 507
defined somewhere in the input system, and the earlier the better, to prevent headroom or 
linearity being affected by subsonic disturbances, but this is not a good place to do it. A 
suitable time-constant immediately after the input amplifier is the way to go, but remember 
that capacitors used as time-constants may distort unless they are NP0 ceramic, polystyrene, 
or polypropylene (see  Chapter 2 for more on this). 
 R7, R8 are DC drain resistors to prevent charges lingering on C5 and C6. These can be made 
lower than for the unbalanced input as the input impedances are lower, so a value of say 
100 kΩ rather than 220 kΩ makes relatively little difference to the total input impedance. 
 A useful property of this kind of balanced amplifier is that it does not go mad when the inputs 
are left open-circuit – in fact it is actually  less noisy than with its inputs shorted to ground. 
This is the opposite of the ‘normal’ behaviour of a high-impedance unterminated input. 
This is because two things happen; open-circuiting the hot input doubles the resistance seen 
by the non-inverting input of the opamp, raising its noise contribution by 3 dB. However, 
opening the cold input makes the noise gain drop by 6 dB, giving a net drop in noise output 
of approx. 3 dB. This of course refers only to the internal noise of the amplifier stage, and 
pickup of external interference is always possible on an unterminated input. The input 
impedances here are modest, however, and the problem is less serious than you might think. 
Having said that, deliberately leaving inputs unterminated is always bad practice. 
 If this circuit is built with four 10 kΩ resistors and a 5532 opamp section, the noise output 
is 104.8 dBu with the inputs terminated to ground via 50 Ω resistors. As noted above, the 
input impedance of the cold input is actually lower than the resistor connected to it when 
working balanced, and if it is desirable to raise this input impedance to 10 kΩ, it could 
be done by raising the four resistors to 16 kΩ; this slightly degrades the noise output to 
103.5 dBu.  Table 18.8 gives some examples of how the noise output depends on the resistor 
value; the third column gives the noise with the input unterminated, and shows that in each 
case the amplifier is about 3 dB quieter when open-circuited. It also shows that a useful 
improvement in noise performance is obtained by dropping the resistor values to the lowest 
that a 5532 can easily drive (the opamp has to drive the feedback resistor), though this usually 
gives unacceptably low input impedances (there is more on that at the end of the chapter).

 Variations on the balanced input stage 
 I now give a collection of balanced input circuits that offer advantages or extra features 
over the standard balanced input configuration. The circuit diagrams often omit stabilising 
capacitors, input filters, and DC-blocking capacitors to improve the clarity of the basic 
principle. They can easily be added; in particular bear in mind that a stabilising capacitor like 
C1 in  Figure 18.9 is often needed to guarantee freedom from high-frequency oscillation, and 
C2, of equal value, must also be added to maintain balance at HF. 
 Combined unbalanced and balanced inputs 
 If both unbalanced and balanced inputs are required, it is extremely convenient if it can 
be arranged so that no switching between them is required. Switches cost money, mean 
more holes in the metalwork, and add to assembly time.  Figure 18.10 shows an effective 
way to implement this. In balanced mode, the source is connected to the balanced input and 
the unbalanced input left unterminated. In unbalanced mode, the source is connected to the 
unbalanced input and the balanced input left unterminated, and no switching is required. It 
might appear that these unterminated inputs would pick up extra noise, but in practice this is 
not the case. It works very well and I have used it successfully in high-end equipment for two 
prestigious manufacturers. 
 As described above, in the world of hifi balanced signals are at twice the level of the 
equivalent unbalanced signals, and so the balanced input must have a gain of ½ or 6 dB 
relative to the unbalanced input to get the same gain by either path. This is done here by 
increasing R1 and R3 to 20 kΩ. The balanced gain can be greater or less than unity, but the 
 Figure 18.10 : Combined balanced and unbalanced input ampliﬁ er with no switching required 

Line inputs 509
gain via the unbalanced input is always approximately unity unless R5 is given a higher value 
to deliberately introduce attenuation. 
 There are two minor compromises in this circuit which need to be noted. Firstly, the noise 
performance in unbalanced mode is worse than for the dedicated unbalanced input described 
earlier in this chapter, because R2 is effectively in the signal path and adds Johnson noise. 
Secondly, the input impedance of the unbalanced input cannot be very high because it is set 
by R4, and if this is increased in value all the resistances must be increased proportionally 
and the noise performance will be markedly worse. It is important that only one input cable 
should be connected at a time, because if an unterminated cable is left connected to an unused 
input, the cable capacitance to ground can cause frequency response anomalies and might, in 
adverse circumstances, cause HF oscillation. A prominent warning on the back panel and in 
the manual is a very good idea. 
 The Superbal input 
 This version of the balanced input amplifier, shown in  Figure 18.11 , has been referred to as 
the ‘Superbal’ circuit because it gives equal impedances into the two inputs for differential 
signals. It was publicised by David Birt of the BBC [6], but I have been told it was invented by 
Ted Fletcher at Alice. With the circuit values shown the differential input impedance is exactly 
10 kΩ via both hot and cold inputs. The common-mode input impedance is 20 kΩ as before. 
 Figure 18.11 : The Superbal balanced input ampliﬁ er  

510 Chapter 18
 In the standard balanced input R4 is connected to ground, but here its lower end is actively 
driven with an inverted version of the output signal, giving symmetry. The increased amount 
of negative feedback reduces the gain with four equal resistors to – 6 dB instead of unity. The 
gain can be reduced below 6 dB by giving the inverter a gain of more than one; if R1, R2, 
R3 and R4 are all equal, the gain is 1/(A1), where A is the gain of the inverter stage. This is 
of limited use as the inverter U1:B will now clip before the forward amplifier U1:A, reducing 
headroom. If the gain of the inverter stage is gradually reduced from unity to zero, the stage 
slowly turns back into a standard balanced amplifier with the gain increasing from 6 dB to 
unity and the input impedances becoming less and less equal. If a gain of less than unity is 
required it should be obtained by increasing R1 and R3. 
 R5 and R6 should be kept as low in value as possible to minimise Johnson noise; there is 
no reason why they have to be equal in value to R1, etc. The only restriction is the ability 
of U1:A to drive R6 and U1:B to drive R5, both resistors being effectively grounded at one 
end. The capacitor C1 will almost certainly be needed to ensure HF stability; the value in 
the figure is only a suggestion. It should be kept as small as possible because reducing the 
bandwidth of the inverter stage impairs CMRR at high frequencies. 
 Switched-gain balanced inputs 
 A balanced input stage that can be switched to two different gains while maintaining 
CMRR is very useful. Equipment often has to give optimal performance with both semi-pro 
(7.8 dBu) and professional (4 dBu) input levels. If the nominal internal level of the 
system is in the normal range of 2 to 6 dBu, the input stage must be able to switch 
between amplifying and attenuating, while maintaining good CMRR in both modes. 
 The brute-force way to change gain in a balanced input stage is to switch the values of 
either R1 and R3, or R2 and R4, in  Figure 18.4 , keeping the pairs equal in value to maintain 
the CMRR; this needs a double–pole switch for each input channel. A much more elegant 
technique is shown in  Figure 18.12 . Perhaps surprisingly, the gain of a differential amplifier 
can be manipulated by changing the drive to the feedback arm (R2 etc.) only, and leaving 
the other arm R4 unchanged, without affecting the CMRR. The essential point is to keep the 
source resistance of the feedback arm the same, but drive it from a scaled version of the 
opamp output.  Figure 18.12 does this with the network R5, R6, which has a source resistance 
made up of 6k8 in parallel with 2k2, which is 1.662 kΩ. This is true whether R6 is switched 
to the opamp output (low gain setting) or to ground (high gain setting), for both have 
effectively zero impedance. For low gain the negative feedback is not attenuated, but fed 
through to R2 and R7 via R5, R6 in parallel. For high gain R5 and R6 become a potential 
divider, so the amount of feedback is decreased and the gain increased. The value of R2  R7 
is reduced from 7k5 by 1.662 kΩ to allow for the source impedance of the R5, R6 network; 
this requires the distinctly non-standard value of 5.838 kΩ, which is here approximated by R2 

Line inputs 511
and R7 which give 5.6 kΩ  240 Ω  5.840 kΩ. This value is the best that can be done with 
E24 resistors; it is obviously out by 2 Ω, but that is much less than a 1% tolerance on R2, and 
so will have only a vanishingly small effect on the CMRR. 
 Note that this stage can attenuate as well as amplify if R1, R3 are set to be greater than R2, 
R4, as shown here. The nominal output level of the stage is assumed to be 2 dBu; with the 
values shown the two gains are 6.0 and 6.2 dB, so 4 dBu and 7.8 dBu respectively 
will give 2 dBu at the output. Other pairs of gains can of course be obtained by changing 
the resistor values; the important thing is to stick to the principle that the value of R2  R7 
is reduced from the value of R4 by the source impedance of the R5, R6 network. With the 
values shown the differential input impedance is 11.25 kΩ via the cold and 22.5 kΩ via the 
hot input. The common-mode input impedance is 22.5 kΩ. 
 This neat little circuit has the added advantage that nothing bad happens when the switch is 
moved with the circuit operating. When the wiper is between contacts you simply get a gain 
intermediate between the high and low settings, which is pretty much the ideal situation. 
 Variable-gain balanced inputs 
 The beauty of a variable-gain balanced input is that it allows you to get the incoming signal 
up or down to the nominal internal level as soon as possible, minimising both the risk of 
clipping and contamination with circuit noise. The obvious method of making a variable-
gain differential stage is to use dual-gang pots to vary R2, R4 together, to maintain CMRR 
(varying R1, R3 would also alter the input impedances). This is clumsy, and gives a CMRR 
that is both bad and highly variable due to the inevitable mismatches between pot sections. 
For a stereo input the required 4-gang pot is an unappealing proposition. 
 Figure 18.12 : A balanced input ampliﬁ er with gain switching that maintains good CMRR 

512 Chapter 18
 There is, however, a way to get a variable gain with good CMRR using a single pot section. 
The principle is essentially the same as for the switched-gain amplifier above; keep constant the 
source impedance driving the feedback arm, but vary the voltage applied. The principle is shown 
in  Figure 18.13 . To the best of my knowledge I invented this circuit in 1982; any comments 
on this point are welcome. The feedback arm R2 is driven by voltage-follower U1:B. This 
eliminates the variations in source impedance at the pot wiper, which would badly degrade the 
CMRR. R6 sets the maximum gain and R5 modifies the gain law to give it a more usable shape. 
The minimum gain is set by the R2/R1 ratio. When the pot is fully up (minimum gain) R5 is 
directly across the output of U1:A so do not make it too low in value. If a centre-detent pot is 
used to give a default gain setting, this may not be very accurate as it partly depends on the ratio 
of pot track (no better than ±20% tolerance, and sometimes worse) to 1% fixed resistors. 
 This configuration is very useful as a general line input with an input sensitivity range of 20 
to 10 dBu. For a nominal output of 0 dBu, the gain of   Figure 18.13   is therefore 20 to 
10 dB, with R5 chosen to give 0 dB gain at the central wiper position. An opamp in a 
feedback path may appear a dubious proposition for HF stability, because of the extra phase-
shift it introduces, but here it is working as a voltage-follower, so its bandwidth is maximised 
and in practice the circuit is dependably stable. 
 This configuration can be improved. The maximum gain in  Figure 18.13 is set by the end-
stop resistor R6 at the bottom of the pot. The pot track resistance will probably be specified at 
± 20%, while the resistor will be a much more precise 1%. The variation of pot track resistance 
can therefore cause quite significant differences between the two channels. It would be nice 
to find a way to eliminate this, in the same way that the Baxandall volume control eliminates 
 Figure 18.13 : Variable-gain balanced input ampliﬁ er: gain 20 to 10 dB 

Line inputs 513
any dependency on the pot track. We could do this if we could get rid of the law-bending 
resistor R5, and also lose the end-stop resistor R6; the pot would then be working as a pure 
potentiometer with its division ratio controlled by the angular position of the wiper alone. If 
the gain range is restricted to around 10 dB, there is no very pressing need for law-bending and 
R5 can be simply omitted. However if we simply do away with the end-stop resistor R6 the 
gain is going to be uncontrollably large with the pot wiper at the bottom of its track. We need a 
way to limit the maximum gain that keeps other resistors away from the pot. 
 I was just going to bed at dawn (the exigencies of the audio service, ma'am) when it occurred to 
me that the answer is to add a resistor that gives a separate feedback path around the differential 
opamp U1:A only. R7 in   Figure 18.14   provides negative feedback independently of the gain 
control and so limits the maximum gain. It is not intuitively obvious (to me, at any rate) but 
the CMRR is still preserved when the gain is altered, just as for  Figure 18.13 . You will note 
in  Figure 18.14 that two resistors R4, R8 are paralleled to get a value exactly equal to R2 in 
parallel with R7. It shows resistor values that give a gain range suitable for combining an active 
stereo balance control with a balanced line input, in one economical stage. The minimum gain 
is 3.3 dB and the maximum gain is 6.6 dB. The gain with the pot wiper central is 0.2 dB 
which I would suggest is close enough to unity for anyone. This concept eliminates the effect of 
pot track resistance on gain, and I propose to call it the Self Input. Alright? 
 The gain equation looks more complex than for the previous example, but it is actually just 
a slight elaboration. The gain is now controlled by the ratio of R1 (R3) to the parallel 
 Figure 18.14 : The Self Input: a variable-gain balanced input ampliﬁ er free from pot-dependence. 
Gain here is 3.3 to 6.6 dB 

514 Chapter 18
combination of R7 and R2, the latter being effectively scaled by the factor A introduced by 
the pot setting. 
 The Self Input stage in  Figure 18.14 has reasonably high resistor values to allow direct 
connection to outside circuitry. As for the other configurations in this chapter, the noise 
performance can be much improved by scaling down all the resistor values and driving the inputs 
via a pair of unity-gain buffers; the low-value resistors reduce Johnson noise and the effect of 
opamp input current noise flowing through them; in this form it was used in my recent  Linear 
Audio preamp design [7]. There is much more on reducing noise in this way later in this chapter. 
 High input-impedance balanced inputs 
 We saw earlier that high input impedances are required to maximise the CMRR of a balanced 
interconnection, but the input impedances offered by the standard balanced circuit are limited by 
the need to keep the resistor values down to control Johnson noise and the effects of current 
noise. High-impedance balanced inputs are also useful for interfacing to valve equipment 
in the strange world of retro-hifi. Adding output cathode-followers to valve circuitry is 
expensive and consumes a lot of extra power, and so the output is often taken directly 
from the anode of a gain-stage, and even a so-called bridging load of 10 kΩ may seriously 
compromise the distortion performance and output capability of the source equipment. 
 Figure 18.15 shows a configuration where the input impedances are determined only by the 
bias resistances R1 and R2. They are shown here as 100 kΩ, but may be considerably higher 
if opamp bias currents permit. A useful property of this circuit is that adding a single resistor 
 Figure 18.15 : High input impedance balanced input 

Line inputs 515
Rg increases the gain, but preserves the circuit balance and CMRR. This configuration cannot 
be set to attenuate because the gain of an opamp with series feedback cannot be reduced 
below unity. 
 It is of course always possible to give a basic balanced input a high input impedance by 
putting unity-gain buffers in front of each input, but that uses three opamp sections rather 
than two. Sometimes, however, it is appropriate. Much more on that later. 
 We noted earlier that the simple balanced input is surprisingly quiet and well-behaved when 
its input is unterminated. This is not the case with this configuration, which because of its 
high input impedances will be both noisy and susceptible to picking-up external interference. 
 The inverting two-opamp input 
 The configuration depicted in  Figure 18.16 has its uses because the hot and cold inputs have 
the same impedances for differential signals, as well as for common-mode voltages [8]. It is 
not suited to high input impedances at normal gains because high resistor values would have 
to be used throughout and they would generate excess Johnson noise, but if it is interfacing 
with a high voltage source so the gain must be well below unity, R1 and R3 can be made high 
in value, and R2, R4, R5 set low, the latter components keeping the noise down. The CMRR 
may degrade at HF because the hot signal has gone through an extra opamp and suffered 
phase shift, interfering with the subtraction; this can be compensated for by the network 
 Figure 18.16 : Inverting two-opamp balanced input 

516 Chapter 18
Rc-1, Rc-2 and C1; the values needed depend on opamp type and must be checked by CMRR 
measurements. 
 I have used this configuration for balanced input feeds from a 100 V loudspeaker line of the sort 
still in use for distributing audio over wide areas. The circuit values shown reduce the 100 V 
input to a nominal 2 dBu (615 mV) internal level. If this circuit is used for that purpose then 
effective input overvoltage protection on the inputs is essential as large voltage transients are 
possible on a loudspeaker line if parts of it are unplugged or plugged with signal present, due to 
the inductance of the line matching transformers. This protection can be conveniently provided 
by the usual diode clamps to the supply rails; this is dealt with at the end of this chapter. The 
input resistors will be of high value in this application so there is very little possibility of 
excessive inputs overheating the resistors or ‘pumping up’ the opamp supply rails. 
 The instrumentation ampliﬁ er 
 Almost every book on balanced or differential inputs includes the three-opamp circuit of 
 Figure 18.17 and praises it as the highest expression of the differential amplifier. It is usually 
called the instrumentation amplifier configuration because of its undoubted superiority 
for data-acquisition (specialised ICs exist that are sometimes also called instrumentation 
amplifiers or in-amps; these are designed for very high CMRR data-acquisition. They are 
expensive and in general not optimised for audio work.) 
 The dual input stage U1:A, U1:B buffers the balanced line from the input impedances of the 
final differential amplifier U2:A, so the four resistances around it can be made much lower 
 Figure 18.17 : The instrumentation ampliﬁ er conﬁ guration. Gain here is 3 times 

Line inputs 517
in value, reducing their Johnson noise and the effects of opamp current noise by a significant 
amount, while keeping the CMRR benefits of presenting high input impedances to the 
balanced line. However, the true beauty of the instrumentation amplifier, much emphasised 
because of its unquestionable elegance, is that the dual input stage, with its shared feedback 
network R3, R4, R5, can be set to have a high differential gain by giving R4 a low value, 
but its common-mode gain is always unity; this property is  not affected by mismatches in 
R3 and R5. The final amplifier then does its usual job of common-mode rejection, and the 
combined CMRR can be very good indeed (over 100 dB) if the first-stage gain is high. 
 This is all well and good, but it is not immediately obvious that the instrumentation amplifier 
configuration can usefully improve the CMRR of audio balanced line inputs. A data-
acquisition application like ECG monitoring may need a gain of thousands of times; a good 
portion of this will be put into the first stage, allow a stunning CMRR to be achieved without 
using precision resistors. Unfortunately, the cruel fact is that in audio usage, this much gain 
at a line input at this point is simply not wanted, except for microphone amplifiers. In a typical 
signal path comprised of opamps, the nominal internal level is usually between 6 and 
0 dBu, and the line level coming in is at the professional level of 4 dBu; what is needed 
is 6 dB of attenuation rather than any gain. Gain at this point and attenuation later would 
introduce what can only be described as a headroom bottleneck. If the incoming level was the 
semi-pro 7.8 dBu, a small amount of gain could be introduced. 
 So does this mean that the instrumentation amplifier configuration has no real advantages 
over an ordinary balanced amplifier with input buffers? No. Stand by for what I believe is a 
whole new way of looking at this stage. 
 Instrumentation ampliﬁ er applications 
 Firstly, there are some applications where gain in a balanced input amplifier is either essential 
or can be made use of. Active crossovers and power amplifiers are probably the two most 
common. 
 Active crossovers are commonly used with no volume control or only a limited-range gain 
trim between them and the power amplifiers, so that it can always be assumed that the power 
amplifier will clip first. As I pointed out in [9], under these conditions the crossover can be 
run at an internal level of 3 Vrms or more, with the output level dropped back to say 1 Vrms 
at the very output of the crossover by a low-impedance passive attenuator. This can give a 
very impressive noise performance because the signal goes through the chain of filters at a 
high level [10]. 
 For a typical active crossover application like this, we therefore need an input stage with 
gain. If the nominal input is 0 dBu (775 mVrms) we want a gain of about four times to get 
the signal up to 3 Vrms (11.8 dBu). We will not need a greater output than this because it 

518 Chapter 18
is sufficient to clip the following power amplifiers, even after the passive attenuators. This 
demonstrates that you can break the rule ‘Do not amplify then attenuate’ so long as there is a 
more severe headroom restriction downstream, and a limited gain control range. 
 If we use the strategy of input buffers followed by balanced amplifiers working at low 
impedances, as described later in this chapter (i.e. not an instrumentation amplifier as there is no 
network between the two input opamps), the required gain can be obtained by altering the ratio 
of the resistors in the balanced amplifier of a 1–1 configuration. With suitable resistor values 
(R1  R3  560R, R2  R4  2k2) the output noise from this stage (inputs terminated by 50 
Ω) is 100.9 dBu, so its equivalent input noise (EIN) is 100.9  11.8  112.7 dBu, which 
is reasonably quiet. All noise measurements are 22 Hz–22 kHz, rms sensing, unweighted. 
 The other area for instrumentation amplifier techniques is that of power amplifiers with balanced 
inputs. The voltage gain of the power amplifier itself is frequently about 22 times (26.8 dB) 
for its own technical reasons. If we take a power output of 100 W into 8 Ω as an example, the 
maximum output voltage is 28.3 Vrms, so the input level must be 28.3/22  1.29 Vrms. If the 
nominal input level is 4 dBu (1.23 Vrms) then a very modest gain of 1.05 times is required, and 
we will gain little from using an instrumentation amplifier with that gain in Stage 1. If however 
the nominal input level is 0 dBu (0.775 Vrms), a higher gain of 1.66 times is needed but that 
is still only a theoretical CMRR improvement of 4.4 dB. However, we can again make use of 
the fact that a relatively small signal voltage is enough to clip the power amplifier, and we can 
amplify the input signal – perhaps by four times again – and then attenuate it, along with the 
noise from the balanced input amplifier. 
 The instrumentation ampliﬁ er with 4 gain 
 Since we need a significant amount of gain, the instrumentation amplifier configuration 
is a viable alternative to the input buffer- balanced amplifier approach, giving a CMRR 
theoretically improved by 11.8 dB, the gain of its first stage. It uses the same number of 
opamps – three. A suitable circuit is shown in  Figure 18.18 . This gives a gain of 3.94 times, 
which is as close as you can get to 4.00 with E24 values. My tests show that the theoretical 
CMRR improvement really is obtained. To take just one set of results, when I built the 
second stage it gave a CMRR of 56 dB working alone, but when the first stage was added 
the CMRR leapt up to 69 dB, an improvement of 13 dB. These one-off figures (13 dB 
is actually better than the 12 dB improvement you would get if all resistors were exact) 
obviously depend on the specific resistor examples I used, but you get the general idea. The 
CMRR was flat across the audio band. 
 I do realise that there is an unsettling flavour of something-for-nothing about this, but it really 
does work. The total gain required can be distributed between the two stages in any way, but 
it should all be concentrated in Stage 1, as shown in  Figure 18.18 , to obtain the maximum 
CMRR benefit. 

Line inputs 519
 What about the noise performance? Fascinatingly, it is considerably improved. The noise output of 
this configuration is usefully lower at 105.4 dBu, which is no less than 4.5 dB better than the – 
100.9 dBu we got from the more conventional 1–1 configuration described above. This is because 
the amplifiers in Stage 1 are working in better conditions for low noise than those in Stage 2. They 
have no significant resistance in series with the non-inverting inputs to generate Johnson noise or 
turn the opamp current noise into voltage noise. As they implement all the gain before the signal 
reaches Stage 2, the noise contribution of the latter is therefore less significant. 
 When noise at 105.4 dBu is put through a 10 dB passive attenuator to get back down to the 
output level we want, as might typically be done at the output of an active crossover, it will 
become 115.4 dBu, which I suggest is very quiet indeed. 
 The circuit in  Figure 18.18 requires some ancillary components before it is ready to face the 
world.  Figure 18.19 shows it with EMC RF filtering (R19, C1 and R20, C4), non-polarised 
DC-blocking capacitors (C2, C3), and capacitors C5, C6 to ensure HF stability. R21, R22 
are DC-drain resistors that ensure that any charge left on the DC-blocking capacitors by 
the source equipment when the connector is unplugged is quickly drained away. These extra 
components are omitted from subsequent diagrams to aid clarity. 
 So, here we are with all of the gain in the first stage, for the best CMRR, and this is followed 
by a unity-gain Stage 2. Now let’s extend this thinking a little. Suppose Stage 2 had a gain of 
less than unity? We could then put more gain in Stage 1, and get a further free and guaranteed 
 Figure 18.18 : Instrumentation-ampliﬁ er balanced input stage with gain of 4 times 

520 Chapter 18
CMRR improvement, while keeping the overall gain the same. But can we do this without 
causing headroom problems in Stage 1? 
 The instrumentation amplifier in  Figure 18.20 has had the gain of Stage 1 doubled to eight 
times (actually 7.67 times; 0.36 dB low, but as close as you can get with E24 values) by 
reducing R4, while the input resistors R6, R7 to Stage 2 have been doubled in value so that 
stage now has a gain of 0.5 times, to keep the total gain at approx. four times. 
 Figure 18.19 : Practical instrumentation-ampliﬁ er balanced input stage with gain of 4 times 
 Figure 18.20 : Instrumentation-ampliﬁ er balanced input stage with gain of 8 times in Stage 1 and 
0.5 times in Stage 2 

Line inputs 521
 In this case the theoretical CMRR improvement is once more the gain of Stage 1, which 
is 7.67 times, and therefore 17.7 dB. Stage 2 gave a measured CMRR of 53 dB working 
alone, but when Stage 1 was added the CMRR increased to 70 dB, an improvement 
of 17 dB, significantly greater than the 14 dB improvement obtained when Stage 1 had 
a gain of four times. The noise output was 106.2 dBu, which is better than the four-times 
instrumentation amplifier by 0.8 dB, and better than the somewhat more conventional 1–1 
configuration by a convincing 5.3 dB. When the noise level of 106.2 dBu is put through 
the 10 dB passive attenuator to get back down to the level we want, this will become 
116.2 dBu, which is even quieter than the previous version. 
 You may well be getting nervous about having a gain as high as eight times followed by 
attenuation; have we compromised the headroom? If we assume that, as before, the maximum 
output we need is 3 Vrms, then with a total gain of four times we will have 0.775 Vrms 
between the two inputs, and the corresponding signal voltages at each output of Stage 1 are also 
3 Vrms. These outputs are in anti-phase, and so when they are combined in Stage 2, with its 
gain of 0.5 times, we get 3 Vrms at the final output. This means that in balanced operation 
all three amplifiers will clip simultaneously, and the input amplifier can pass the maximum 
opamp output level before clipping. With the usual ±17 V supply rails this is about 10 Vrms. 
 So far so good; all the voltages are well below clipping. But note that we have assumed 
a balanced input, and unless you are designing an entire system, that is a dangerous 
assumption. If the input is driven with an unbalanced output of the same level, we will have 
0.775 Vrms on one input pin, and nothing on the other. You might fear we would get 6 Vrms 
on one output of Stage 1 and nothing on the other; that would still be some way below 
clipping but the safety margin is shrinking fast. In fact, things are rather better than that. The 
cross-coupling of the feedback network R3, R4, R5 greatly reduces the difference between 
the two outputs of stage 1 with unbalanced inputs. With 0.775 Vrms on one input pin, and 
nothing on the other, the Stage 1 outputs are 3.39 Vrms and 2.61 Vrms, which naturally 
sum to 6 Vrms, reduced to 3 Vrms out by Stage 2. The higher voltage is at the output of 
the amplifier associated with the driven input. Maximum output with an unbalanced input 
is slightly reduced from 10 Vrms to 9.4 Vrms. This minor restriction does not apply to the 
earlier version with only four times gain in Stage 1. 
 This shows us that if we can assume a balanced input and stick with a requirement for a 
maximum output of 3 Vrms, we have a bit more elbow-room than you might think for using 
higher gains in Stage 1 of an instrumentation amplifier. Taking into account the possibility of 
an unbalanced input, we could further increase the gain by a factor of 10/3.39  2.95 times, 
on top of the doubling of Stage 1 gain we have already implemented. This gives a Stage 1 
gain of 22.6 times. I decided to be conservative and go for a Stage 1 gain of 21 times; the 
gain of Stage 2 is correspondingly reduced to 0.19 times to maintain a total gain of four times. 
This version is shown in  Figure 18.21 ; you will note that the feedback resistors R3, R4, R5 
in Stage 1 have been scaled up by a factor of two. This is because Stage 1 is now working at 

522 Chapter 18
a higher level; remember also that the resistors R3 and R5 are not the only load on Stage 1, 
because each of its opamp outputs is looking at the Stage 2 inputs driven in anti-phase, so 
its inverting input loading is heavier than it at first appears. Leaving R3, R5 at 1 kΩ would 
significantly degrade the distortion performance; I found it doubled the THD at 10 kHz from 
0.0012% to 0.0019% for a 3 Vrms output. 
 When Stage 2 was tested alone its CMRR was 61 dB; clearly we have been lucky with our 
resistors. Adding on Stage 1 increased it to a rather spectacular 86 dB, an improvement 
of no less than 25 dB. This degrades to 83 dB at 20 kHz; this is the first time it has not 
appeared flat across the audio band. The theoretical CMRR improvement is 26.4 dB, without 
trim presets or selected components. 
 The output noise level remains at 106.2 dBu; we have clearly gained all the noise advantage 
we can by increasing the Stage 1 gain. 
 Note that throughout this discussion I have assumed that there are no objections to running an 
opamp at a signal level not far from clipping, and in particular that the distortion performance 
is not significantly harmed by doing that. This is true for many modern opamps such as the 
LM4562, and also for the veteran 5532, when it is not loaded to the limit of its capability. 
 The instrumentation ampliﬁ er at unity gain 
 If you want a unity-gain input stage but also some CMRR improvement, some compromise is 
required.

and 0.19 times in Stage 2. Maximum output 3 Vrms 

Line inputs 523
 Putting R3, R5  1 kΩ and R4  2 kΩ gives a Stage 1 gain of two times, which is undone by 
setting R6, R7 to 1k6 in Stage 2 to give a gain of 0.5 times. This will pass the full 10 Vrms 
maximum opamp level, but only in balanced mode. In unbalanced mode, Stage 1 will clip 
at the opamp connected to the driven input because when unbalanced the gain to this point 
from the input is 1.5 times. The maximum signal that can be handled in unbalanced mode is 
therefore about 7 Vrms. The resulting input amplifier is shown in  Figure 18.22 . A heavy load 
is placed on the Stage 1 amplifiers in this situation and for the best distortion behaviour it 
would be better to make R3, R5  2 kΩ and R4  4 kΩ. 
 When I did the measurements, Stage 2 alone had a CMRR of 57 dB; adding on Stage 1 
brought this up to 63 dB (this exact correspondence of theoretical and measured improvement 
is just a coincidence). You can therefore have 6 dB more CMRR free, gratis, and for absolutely 
nothing, so long as you are prepared to tolerate a loss of 3.5 dB in headroom if the stage is run 
unbalanced but with the same input voltage. The noise output is 111.6 dBu. 
 A typical hifi output gives 1 Vrms in unbalanced use, and 2 Vrms when run balanced, as 
the cold output is provided by a simple inverter, the presence of which doubles the total 
output voltage.  Figure 18.22 shows the signal voltages when our unity-gain input stage is 
connected to a 2 Vrms balanced input. This sort of situation is more likely to occur in hifi 
than in professional audio; in the latter simulated ‘floating transformer winding’ outputs 
are sometimes found, where the total output voltage is the same whether the output is run 
balanced or unbalanced (these are described in  Chapter 19 ). 
 Figure 18.22:  Instrumentation-ampliﬁ er balanced input stage with gain of 2 times in Stage 1 and 
0.5 times in Stage 2 for overall unity gain 

524 Chapter 18
 In hifi use it may be possible to assume that the instrumentation amplifier will never be 
connected to a balanced output with a total signal voltage of more than 2 Vrms. If this is 
the case we can once more put extra gain into Stage 1, and undo it with Stage 2, without 
compromising headroom. We are now dealing with a restriction on input level rather than 
output level. We will assume that the 2 Vrms input is required to be reduced to 1 Vrms to give 
adequate headroom in the circuitry that follows, so an overall gain of 0.5 times is required. 
 Finally we will look at how the range of gain control between the instrumentation amplifier 
and the power amplifier affects the headroom situation.  Figure 18.23 shows one of the 
instrumentation amplifiers described above with a maximum output of 3 Vrms, the version in 
 Figure 18.20 with a gain of eight times in Stage 1 and 0.5 times in Stage 2. This is followed by 
a ±10 dB gain trim network that is normally expected to work at the 0 dB setting, i.e. giving 
10 dB of attenuation and so reducing the noise from the input stage. I should point out that 
this simple network does not give ‘0 dB’ at the centre of the pot travel; that point is more like 
three-quarters of the way down. 
 Since the maximum output of this stage is 10 Vrms with a balanced input (slightly less with 
an unbalanced input) clipping will always occur in the power amplifier first so long as the 
gain trim is set above 10 dB. At the 10 dB setting (which introduces 20 dB of actual 
attenuation) the input amplifier and the power amp will clip simultaneously; if more 
attenuation is permitted then there is the danger that the input amplifier will clip first, and this 
cannot be corrected by the gain trim. Note the low resistor values in the gain trim network to 
minimise Johnson noise and also the effect of the power amplifier input noise current. A low 
source impedance is also required by most power amplifiers to prevent input current distortion 
[11]. In the worst-case position (approx. wiper central) the output impedance of the network 
is 275 Ω, and the Johnson noise from that resistance is 128.2 dBu, well below the noise 
from the input amplifier, which is 106.2 dBu  6 dB  112.2 dBu, and also below the 
equivalent input noise of the power amplifier, which is unlikely to be better than 122 dBu.

 Transformer balanced inputs 
 When it is essential that there is no galvanic connection (i.e. no electrical conductor) 
between two pieces of equipment, transformer inputs are indispensable. They are also 
useful if EMC conditions are severe.  Figure 18.24 shows a typical transformer input. The 
transformer usually has a 1:1 ratio, and is enclosed in a metal shielding can which must be 
grounded. Good line transformers have an inter-winding shield that must also be grounded 
or the high-frequency CMRR will be severely compromised. The transformer secondary 
must see a high impedance as this is reflected to the primary and represents the input 
impedance; here it is set by R2, and a buffer drives the circuitry downstream. In addition, 
if the secondary loading is too heavy there will be increased transformer distortion at 
low frequencies. Line input transformers are built with small cores and are only intended 
to deliver very small amounts of power; they are  not interchangeable with line output 
transformers. A most ingenious approach to dealing with this distortion problem by 
operating the input transformer core at near-zero flux was published by Paul Zwicky in 
1986 [12]. 
 There is a bit more to correctly loading the secondary transformer. If it is simply loaded 
with a high-value resistor there will be peaking of the frequency response due to resonance 
between the transformer leakage inductance and the winding capacitance. This is shown in 
 Figure 18.25  , where a Sowter 3276 line input transformer (a high-quality component) was 
given a basic resistive loading of 100 kΩ. The result was Trace A, which has a 10 dB peak 
around 60 kHz. This is bad not only because it accentuates the effect of out-of-band noise, 
but because it intrudes on the audio frequency response, giving a lift of 1 dB at 20 kHz. 
Reducing the resistive load R2 would damp the resonance, but it would also reduce the input 
impedance. The answer is to add a Zobel network, i.e. a resistor and capacitor in series, across 
the secondary; this has no effect except on high frequencies. The first attempt used R1  2k7 and 
C1 1 nF, giving Trace B, where the peaking has been reduced to 4 dB around 40 kHz, but 
the 20 kHz lift is actually slightly greater. R1  2k7 and C1 2 nF gave Trace C, which is a 
 Figure 18.24:  A transformer balanced input. R1 and C1 are the Zobel network that damps the 
secondary resonance 

526 Chapter 18
bit better in that it only has a 2 dB peak. Some more experimentation resulted in R1  3k3 
and C1  4.3 nF (3n3  1nF) and yielded Trace D, which is pretty flat, though there is a small 
droop around 10 kHz. The Zobel values are fairly critical for the flattest possible response and 
must certainly be adjusted if the transformer type is changed. 
 Input overvoltage protection 
 Input overvoltage protection is not common in hifi applications, but is regarded as essential 
in most professional equipment. The normal method is to use clamping diodes, as shown 
in  Figure 18.26 , that prevent certain points in the input circuitry from moving outside the 
supply rails. 
 This is straightforward, but there are two points to watch. Firstly, the ability of this circuit 
to withstand excessive input levels is not without limit. Sustained overvoltages may burn 
out R5 and R6, or pump unwanted amounts of current into the supply rails; this sort of 
protection is mainly aimed at transients. Secondly, diodes have a non-linear junction 
capacitance when they are reverse biased, so if the source impedance is significant the 
diodes will cause distortion at high frequencies. To quantify this problem here are the 
results of a few tests. If  Figure 18.26 is fed from the low impedance of the usual kind 
of line output stage, the impedance at the diodes will be about 1 kΩ and the distortion 
induced into an 11 Vrms 20 kHz input will be below the noise floor. However, if the 
source impedance is high so the impedance at the diodes is increased to 10 kΩ, with 
the same input level, the THD at 20 kHz will be degraded from 0.0030% to 0.0044% 
by adding the diodes. I have thought up a rather elegant way to eliminate this effect 
completely; anybody interested?

 Low-noise balanced inputs 
 So far we have not said much about the noise performance of balanced inputs, though we 
have noted several times that the standard balanced input amplifier with four 10 kΩ resistors 
as in  Figure 18.27a is markedly noisier than an unbalanced input like that in  Figure 18.1 . 
The unbalanced input stage, with its input terminated by 50 Ω to ground, has a noise output 
of 119.0 dBu over the usual 22 Hz–22 kHz bandwidth. If the balanced circuit is built with 
10 kΩ resistors and a 5532 section, the noise output is 104.8 dBu with the inputs similarly 
terminated. This is a big difference of 14.2 dB. 
 In the hifi world in particular, where an amplifier may have both unbalanced and balanced 
inputs, many people would feel that this situation is the wrong way round. Surely the 
balanced stage input, with its professional XLR connector and its much-vaunted rejection of 
ground noise, should show a better performance in all departments? Well, it does – except as 
regards internal noise, and a 14 dB discrepancy is both clearly audible and hard to explain 
away. This section explains how to design it away instead. 
 We know that the source of the extra noise is the relatively high resistor values around the 
opamp (see  Table 18.8 earlier in the chapter), but these cannot be reduced in the simple 
balanced stage without reducing the input impedances below what is acceptable. The answer is to 
lower the resistor values but buffer them from the input with a pair of voltage-followers; this 
arrangement is shown in  Figure 18.27b . 5532s are a good choice for this as they combine low 
voltage noise with low distortion and good load-driving capability. Since the input buffers 
are voltage-followers with 100% feedback, their gain is very accurately defined at unity and 
CMRR is not degraded; CMRR is still defined by the resistor tolerances and by the bandwidth 
of the differential opamp.  I call this a 1–1 configuration, for reasons which will be made clear.

 Figure 18.27 : Low noise unity-gain balanced inputs using multiple 5532 buffers and differential ampliﬁ ers  

Line inputs 529
 There is a limit to how far the four resistors can be reduced, as the differential stage has to 
be driven by the input buffers and it also has to drive its own feedback arm. If 5532s are used 
a safe value that gives no measurable deterioration of the distortion performance is about 
820 Ω, and an 5532 differential stage alone (without the buffers) and 4  820 Ω resistors 
gives a noise output of 111.7 dBu, which is 6.6 dB lower than the standard 4  10 kΩ 
version. Adding the two input buffers degrades this only slightly to 110.2 dB, because we 
are adding only the voltage noise component of the two new opamps, and we are still 5.1 dB 
quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version. It is an interesting point that we now have three 
opamps in the signal path instead of one, but we still get a significantly lower noise level. 
 This might appear to be all we can do; it is not possible to reduce the value of the four 
resistors around the differential amplifier any further without compromising linearity. 
However, there is almost always some way to go further in the great game that is electronics, 
and here are three possibilities. A step-up transformer could be used to exploit the low source 
impedance (remember we are still assuming the source impedances are 50 Ω) and it might 
well work superbly in terms of noise alone, but transformers are always heavy, expensive, 
susceptible to magnetic fields and of doubtful low-frequency linearity. We would also very 
quickly run into headroom problems; balanced line input amplifiers are normally required to 
attenuate rather than amplify. 
 We could design a hybrid stage with discrete input transistors, which are quieter than those 
integrated into IC opamps, coupled to an opamp to provide raw loop gain; this can be quite 
effective but you need to be very careful about high-frequency stability, and it is difficult to 
get an improvement of more than 6 dB. 
 Thirdly, we could design our own opamp using all discrete parts; this approach tends to 
have less stability problems as all circuit parameters are accessible, but it definitely requires 
rather specialised skills, and the result takes up a lot of PCB area. 
 Since none of those three approaches are appealing, now what? One of the most useful 
techniques in low-noise electronics is to use two identical amplifiers so that the gains add 
arithmetically, but the noise from the two separate amplifiers, being uncorrelated, partially 
cancels. Thus we get a 3 dB noise advantage each time the number of amplifiers used is 
doubled. This technique works very well with multiple opamps, as expounded in  Chapter 1 ; 
let us apply it and see how far it may be usefully taken. 
 Since the noise of a single 5532-section unity-gain buffer is only 119.0 dBu, and the noise from 
the 4  820 Ω differential stage (without buffers) is a much higher 111.7 dBu, the differential 
stage is clearly the place to start work. We will begin by using two identical 4  820 Ω differential 
amplifiers as shown in the top section of  Figure 18.27c , both driven from the existing pair of 
input buffers. I call this a 1–2 configuration. This will give partial cancellation of both resistor 
and opamp noise from the two differential stages if their outputs are summed. The main question 
is how to sum the two amplifier outputs; any active solution would introduce another opamp, 

530 Chapter 18
and hence more noise, and we would almost certainly wind up worse off than when we started. 
The answer is, however, beautifully simple. We just connect the two amplifier outputs together 
with 10 Ω resistors; the gain does not change but the noise output drops. We are averaging rather 
than summing. The signal output of both amplifiers is nominally the same, so no current should 
flow from one opamp output to the other. In practice there will be slight gain differences due to 
resistor tolerances, but with 1% resistors I have never experienced any hint of a problem. The 
combining resistor values are so low at 10 Ω that their Johnson noise contribution is negligible. 
 The use of multiple differential amplifiers has another advantage – the CMRR errors are also 
reduced in the same way that this noise is reduced. This is similar to the use of multiple 
parallel capacitors to improve RIAA accuracy, as explained in  Chapter 8 . 
 We therefore have the arrangement of  Figure 18.27c , with single input buffers (i.e. one per input) 
and two differential amplifiers. This reduces the noise output by 2.3 dB to 112.5 dBu, 
which is quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version by an encouraging 7.4 dB. We do not 
get a full 3 dB noise improvement because both differential amplifiers are handling the noise from 
the input buffers, which is correlated and so is not reduced by partial cancellation. The contribution 
of the input buffer noise is further brought out if we take the next step of using four differential 
amplifiers (1–4 configuration). There is of course nothing special about using amplifiers in powers 
of two. It is perfectly possible to use three or five differential amplifiers in the array, which will give 
intermediate amounts of noise reduction. If you have a spare opamp section, then put it to work! 
 So, leaving the input buffers unchanged, we use them to drive an array of four differential 
amplifiers. These are added on at the dotted lines in the lower half of   Figure 18.27 c. We get a 
further improvement, but only by 1.5 dB this time. The output noise is down to 114.0 dBu, 
quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version by 8.9 dB. You can see that at this point we are 
proceeding by decreasing steps, as the input buffer noise is starting to dominate, and there 
seems little point in doubling up the differential amplifiers again; the amount of hardware 
could be regarded as a bit excessive, and so would the PCB area occupied. The increased 
loading on the input buffers is also a bit of a worry. 
 A more fruitful approach is to tackle the noise from the input buffers, by doubling them up 
as in  Figure 18.27d , so that each buffer drives only two of the four differential amplifiers. 
This means that the buffer noise will also undergo partial cancellation, and will be reduced 
by 3 dB (2–4 configuration). There is however still the contribution from the differential 
amplifier noise, and so the actual improvement on the previous version is 2.2 dB, bringing 
the output noise down to 116.2 dBu, which is quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version 
by a thumping 11.1 dB. Remember that there are two inputs, and ‘double buffers’ means two 
buffers per hot and cold input, giving a total of four in the complete circuit. 
 Since doubling up the input buffers gave us a useful improvement, it’s worth trying again, so 
we have a structure with quad buffers and four differential amplifiers, as shown in   Figure 18.28  , 
where each differential amplifier now has its very own buffer (4–4 configuration). This improves 

 Figure 18.28 : The ﬁ nal 5532 low noise unity-gain balanced input stage, with quad input buffers 
and four differential ampliﬁ ers (4–4 conﬁ guration). The noise output is only 117.0 dBu 

532 Chapter 18
on the previous version by a rather less satisfying 0.8 dB, giving an output noise level of 
117.0 dBu, quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version by 11.9 dB. The small improvement 
we have gained indicates that the focus of noise reduction needs to be returned to the 
differential amplifier array, but the next step there would seem to be using eight amplifiers, 
which is not very appealing. Thoughts about ears of corn on chessboards tend to intrude at 
this point. 
 This is a good moment to pause and see what we have achieved. We have built a balanced 
input stage that is quieter than the standard circuit by 11.9 dB, using standard components of 
low cost. We have used increasing numbers of them, but the total cost is still small compared 
with enclosures, power supplies, etc. On the other hand, the power consumption is clearly 
several times greater. The technology is highly predictable and the noise reduction reliable; 
in fact bullet-proof. The linearity is as good as that of a single opamp of the same type, and in 
the same way there are no HF stability problems. 
 What we have not done is build a balanced input that is quieter than the unbalanced one – we 
are still 2.0 dB short of that target, but at least we have reached a point where the balanced 
input is not obviously noisier. 
 These noise results are summarised in  Table 18.10 at the end of the chapter. 
 Low-noise balanced inputs in action 
 Please don’t think that this examination of low-noise input options is merely a voyage off into 
pure theory. It has real uses and has been applied in practice, for example, in the Cambridge 
Audio 840 W power amplifier, a design of mine which, I might modestly mention in 
passing, won a CES Innovation Award in January 2008. This unit has both unbalanced 
and balanced inputs, and conventional technology would have meant that the balanced 
inputs would have been significantly the noisier of the two. Since the balanced input is 
the ‘premium’ input, many people would think there was something amiss with this state 
of affairs. We therefore decided the balanced input had to be quieter than the unbalanced 
input. Using 5532s in an architecture similar to those outlined above, this requirement 
proved straightforwardly attainable, and the final balanced input design was both 
economical and quieter than its unbalanced neighbour by a dependable 0.9 dB. Two other 
versions were evaluated that made the balanced input quieter than the unbalanced one by 
2.8 dB, and by 4.7 dB, at somewhat greater cost and complexity. These were put away 
for possible future upgrades. 
 The Signal Transfer Company [13] manufactures a low-noise balanced input card based on 
these principles which has 47 kΩ input impedances, unity gain, and a noise output of only 
115 dBu. 

Line inputs 533
 Ultra-low-noise balanced inputs 
 In the section on low-noise balanced inputs above, we reclined briefly on our laurels having 
achieved an economical balanced input stage with output noise at the extremely low level of 
117.0 dBu. Regrettably this is still 2 dB noisier than a simple unbalanced input. It would be 
wrong to conclude from this that the resources of electronic design are exhausted. At the end 
of the noise-reduction sequence we were aware that the dominant noise source was currently 
the differential amplifier array, and we shrank from doubling up again to use eight amplifiers 
because of issues of cost and the PCB area occupied. We will take things another step by 
taking a much more relaxed view of cost (as one does at the ‘high-end’), and see how that 
changes the game. We will however retain some concern about PCB area. 
 An alternative way to make the differential amplifier array quieter is simply to use opamps 
that are quieter. These will inevitably be more expensive – much more expensive – than the 
ubiquitous 5532. Because of the low resistor values around the opamps we need to focus on 
low voltage-noise rather than low current noise, and there are several that are significantly 
better than the 5532, as shown by the typical noise density figures in  Table 18.9.

 Clearly moving to the 5534A will give a significant noise reduction, but since there is only a 
single opamp per package, and external compensation is needed, the board area used will be 
much greater. Instead we will try the LM4562, a bipolar opamp which has finally surpassed 
the 5532 in performance. The input voltage noise density is typically 2.7 nV/√ Hz, substantially 
lower than the 5 nV/√ Hz of the 5532. For applications with low source impedances, this implies 
a handy noise advantage of 5 dB or more. The LM4562 is a dual opamp and will not take up 
more space. At the time of writing it is something like 10 times more expensive than the 5532. 
 Step 1: We replace all four opamps in the differential amplifiers with LM4562s. They are a 
drop-in replacement with no circuit adjustments required at all. We leave the quad 5532 input 
buffers in place. The noise output drops by an impressive 1.9 dB, giving an output noise level 
of 118.9 dBu, quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version by 14.1 dB, and only 0.1 dB 
noisier than the unbalanced stage. 

534 Chapter 18
 Step 2: Replace the quad 5532 buffers with quad LM4562 buffers. Noise falls by only 0.6 dB, 
the output being 119.5 dBu, but at last we have a balanced stage that is quieter than the 
unbalanced stage, by a small but solid 0.5 dB. 
 One of the pre-eminent low-noise-with-low-source-resistance opamps is the AD797 from 
Analog Devices, which has a remarkably low voltage noise at 0.9 nV/√ Hz (typical at 1 kHz) 
but it is a very expensive part, costing between 20 and 25 times more than a 5532 at the time 
of writing. The AD797 is a single opamp, while the 5532 is a dual, so the cost per opamp is 
actually 40 to 50 times greater, and more PCB area is required, but the potential improvement 
is so great we will overlook that . . . 
 Step 3: We replace all four opamps in the differential amplifiers with AD797s, putting 
the 5532s back into the input buffers in the hope that we might be able to save money 
somewhere. The noise output drops by a rather disappointing 0.4 dB, giving an output noise 
level of 119.9 dBu, quieter than the original 4  10 kΩ version by 15.1 dB. 
 Perhaps putting those 5532s back in the buffers was a mistake? Our fourth and final move 
in this game of electronic chess is to replace all the quad 5532 input buffers with dual (not 
quad) AD797 buffers. This requires another four AD797s (two per input) and is once more 
not a cheap strategy. We retain the four AD797s in the differential amplifiers. The noise drops 
by another 0.7 dB yielding an output noise level of 120.6 dBu, quieter than the original 
4  10 kΩ version by 15.8 dB, and quieter than the unbalanced stage by a satisfying 1.6 dB. 
You can do pretty much anything in electronics with a bit of thought and a bit of money. 
 You are probably wondering what happened to the LT1028 lurking at the bottom of 
 Table 18.9 . It is true that its voltage noise density is slightly better than that of the AD797, 
but there is a subtle snag. As described in  Chapter 8 , the LT1028 has bias-current cancellation 
circuitry which injects correlated noise currents into the two inputs. These will cancel if 
the impedances seen by the two inputs are the same, but in moving-magnet amplifier use 
the impedances differ radically and the LT1028 is not useful in this application. The input 
conditions here are more benign, but the extra complication is unwelcome and I have never 
used the LT1028 in audio work. In addition, it is a single opamp with no dual version. 
 This is not of course the end of the road. The small noise improvement in the last step we 
made tells us that the differential amplifier array is still the dominant noise source, and 
further development would have to focus on this. A first step would be to see if the relatively 
high current-noise of the AD797s is significant with respect to the surrounding resistor 
values. If so, we need to see if the resistor values can be reduced without degrading linearity 
at full output. We should also check the Johnson noise contribution of all those 820 Ω 
resistors; they are generating 123.5 dBu each at room temperature, but of course the partial 
cancellation effect applies to them as well. 
 All these noise results are also summarised in  Table 18.10 below.

 Unbalanced outputs 
 There are only two electrical output terminals for an unbalanced output – signal and ground. 
However, the unbalanced output stage in  Figure 19.1a is fitted with a three-pin XLR 
connector, to emphasise that it is always possible to connect the cold wire in a balanced cable 
to the ground at the output end and still get all the benefits of common-mode rejection if you 
have a balanced input. If a two-terminal output connector is fitted, the link between the cold 
wire and ground has to be made inside the connector, as shown in  Figure 18.2 in the chapter 
on line inputs. 
 The output amplifier in  Figure 19.1a is configured as a unity-gain buffer, though in some 
cases it will be connected as a series feedback amplifier to give gain. A non-polarised DC 
blocking capacitor C1 is included; 100 μF gives a 3 dB point of 2.6 Hz with one of those 
notional 600 Ω loads. The opamp is isolated from the line shunt-capacitance by a resistor 
R2, in the range 47–100 Ω, to ensure HF stability, and this unbalances the hot and cold line 
impedances. A drain resistor R1 ensures that no charge can be left on the output side of C1; 
it is placed  before R2, so it causes no attenuation. In this case the loss would only be 0.03 dB, 
but such errors can build up to an irritating level in a large system and it costs nothing to 
avoid them. 
 If the cold line is simply grounded as in  Figure 19.1a , then the presence of R2 degrades 
the CMRR of the interconnection to an uninspiring 43 dB even if the balanced input at 
the other end of the cable has infinite CMRR in itself and perfectly matched 10 kΩ input 
impedances. See Chapter 18. 
 To fix this problem,  Figure 19.1b shows what is called an impedance-balanced output. There 
are now three physical terminals, hot, cold, and ground. The cold terminal is neither an input 
nor an output, but a resistive termination R3 with the same resistance as the hot terminal 
output impedance R2. If an unbalanced input is being driven, this cold terminal can be either 
shorted to ground locally or left open-circuit. The use of the word ‘balanced’ is perhaps 
unfortunate as when taken together with an XLR output connector it implies a true balanced 
output with anti-phase outputs, which is  not what you are getting. The impedance-balanced 
approach is not particularly cost-effective, as it requires significant extra money to be spent 

538 Chapter 19
on an XLR connector. Adding an opamp inverter to make it a proper balanced output costs 
little more, especially if there happens to be a spare opamp half available, and it sounds much 
better in the specification. 
 Zero-impedance outputs 
 Both the unbalanced outputs shown in  Figure 19.1 have series output resistors to ensure 
stability when driving cable capacitance. This increases the output impedance, which can 
impair the CMRR of a balanced interconnection, and can also lead to increased crosstalk 
via stray capacitance in some situations. One such scenario that was fixed by the use of a 
so-called ‘zero-impedance’ output is described in  Chapter 22 in the section on mixer insert 
points. The output impedance is of course not exactly zero, but it is very low compared with 
the average series output resistor. 
 Figure 19.2a shows how the zero-impedance technique is applied to an unbalanced output 
stage with 10 dB of gain. Feedback at audio frequencies is taken from outside isolating 
resistor R3 via R2, while the HF feedback is taken from inside R3 via C2 so it is not affected 
by load capacitance and stability is unimpaired. Using a 5532 opamp, the output impedance 
is reduced from 68 Ohms to 0.24 Ohms at 1 kHz – a dramatic reduction that would reduce 
capacitive crosstalk by 49 dB. Output impedance increases to 2.4 Ohms at 10 kHz and 
4.8 Ohms at 20 kHz as opamp open-loop gain falls with frequency. The impedance-balancing 
resistor on the cold pin has been replaced by a link to match the near-zero output impedance 
at the hot pin. More details on zero-impedance outputs are given later in this chapter in the 
section on balanced outputs.  
 Figure 19.2b shows a refinement of this multiple-feedback scheme with three paths. In  Chapter 2 
we saw how electrolytic coupling capacitors can introduce distortion even if the time-constant 
is long enough to give a flat LF response. In  Figure 19.2b most of the feedback is now taken 
from outside C1, via R5, so it can correct capacitor distortion. The DC feedback goes via R2, 
 Figure 19.1 : Unbalanced outputs: a) simple output, b) impedance-balanced output for improved 
CMRR when driving balanced inputs 

Line outputs 539
now much higher in value, and the HF feedback goes through C2 as before to maintain stability 
with capacitive loads. R2 and R5 in parallel come to 10 kΩ so the gain is the same. Any circuit 
with separate DC and AC feedback paths must be checked carefully for frequency response 
irregularities, which may happen well below 10 Hz. A function generator is useful for this. 
 Ground-cancelling outputs: basics 
 This technique, also called a ground-compensated output, appeared in the early 1980s in 
mixing consoles. It allows ground voltages to be cancelled out even if the receiving equipment 
has an unbalanced input; it prevents any possibility of creating a phase error by mis-wiring; 
and it costs virtually nothing except for the provision of a three-pin output connector. 
 Ground-cancelling (GC) separates the wanted signal from the unwanted ground voltage 
by addition at the output end of the link, rather than by subtraction at the input end. If the 
receiving equipment ground differs in voltage from the sending ground, then this difference 
is added to the output signal so that the signal reaching the receiving equipment has the 
same ground voltage superimposed upon it. Input and ground therefore move together and 
the ground voltage has no effect, subject to the usual effects of component tolerances. The 
connecting lead is differently wired from the more common unbalanced-out balanced-in 
situation, as now the cold line is joined to ground at the  input or receiving end. This is 
illustrated in  Figure 19.3 , which compares a conventional balanced link with a GC link.  
 An inverting unity-gain ground-cancel output stage is shown in  Figure 19.4a . The cold pin 
of the output socket is now an input, and has a unity-gain path summing into the main signal 
going to the hot output pin to add the ground voltage. This path R3, R4 has a very low input 
impedance equal to the hot terminal output impedance, so if it  is used with a balanced input, 
the line impedances will be balanced and the combination will still work effectively. The 
6 dB of attenuation in the R3–R4 divider is undone by the gain of two set by R5, R6. It is

capacitor 

540 Chapter 19
unfamiliar to most people to have the cold pin of an output socket as a low impedance input, 
and its very low input impedance minimises the problems caused by mis-wiring. Shorting 
it locally to ground merely converts the output to a standard unbalanced type. On the other 
hand, if the cold input is left unconnected, then there will be a negligible increase in noise 
due to the very low input resistance of R3. 
 This is the most economical GC output, and is very useful to follow an inverting summing 
amplifier in a mixer as it corrects the phase. However, a phase-inversion is not always 
convenient, and  Figure 19.4b shows a non-inverting GC output stage with a gain of 6.6 dB. 
R5 and R6 set up a gain of 9.9 dB for the amplifier, but the overall gain is reduced by 3.3 dB 
 Figure 19.3:  A balanced link uses subtraction at the receiving end to null ground noise, while a 
ground-cancel link uses addition at the sending end

by attenuator R3, R4. The cold line is now terminated by R7, and any signal coming in via 
the cold pin is attenuated by R3, R4 and summed at unity gain with the input signal. The 
stage must be fed from a very low impedance such as an opamp output to work properly. 
There is a slight compromise on noise performance here because attenuation is followed by 
amplification. 
 Figure 19.5 shows the complete circuit of a GC link using an inverting ground-cancel output 
stage. EMC filtering and DC-blocking are included for the unbalanced input stage.  
 Ground-cancelling outputs: CMRR 
 In a balanced link, the CMRR is a measure of how accurately the subtraction is performed 
at the receiving end, and so of how effectively ground noise is nulled. A GC link also has 
an equivalent CMRR that measures how accurately the addition is performed at the sending 
end.  Figure 19.6 shows (for the first time, I think) how to measure the CMRR of a ground-
cancelling link. It is slightly more complicated than for the balanced case. 
 In  Figure 19.6 , a 10 Ω resistor R17 is inserted into the ground of the interconnection. This 
allows the signal generator to move the output ground of the sending amplifier up and down 
with respect to the global ground, via R18. Quite a lot of power has to be supplied so that 
R17 can be kept low in value. 
 If the send amplifier is working properly, the signal applied to OUT– will cancel the signal on 
the output ground, so that as far as the input of the receiving amplifier is concerned, it does 
not exist. Be clear that here we are measuring the CMRR of the sending amplifier, not the 
receiving amplifier.  
 Just as the CMRR of a balanced link depends on the accuracy of the resistors and the open-
loop gain of the opamp in the receiving amplifier, the same parameters determine the CMRR 
of a ground-cancel send amplifier. The measured results from the arrangement in  Figure 19.6 
are given in  Figure 19.7 ; the CMRR as built (with 1% resistors) was 50 dB, flat up to 
 Figure 19.5 : The complete circuit of a GC link using an inverting ground-cancel output

10 kHz. The two lower traces were obtained by progressively trimming the value of R6 to 
minimise the output. If high CMRR is required, a preset adjustment can be used, just as in 
balanced line input amplifiers.  
 Ground-cancelling outputs are an economical way of making ground-loops innocuous when 
there is no balanced input, and it is rather surprising they are not more popular; perhaps 
it is because people find the notion of an input pin on an output connector unsettling. In 
particular, GC outputs would appear to offer the possibility of a quieter interconnection 
than the standard balanced interconnection because a relatively noisy balanced input is not 
required (see  Chapter 18 ). Ground-cancelling outputs can also be made zero-impedance using 
the techniques described earlier. 
 Ground-cancelling outputs: send ampliﬁ er noise 
 In  Figure 19.5 , the main resistors R5 and R6 have the relatively high value of 10 kΩ, for 
comparison with the ‘standard’ balanced input amplifier made with four 10 kΩ resistors. 
Reducing their value in accordance with the principles of low-impedance design gives useful 
reductions in noise, as shown in  Table 19.1. A 5532 opamp was used.    
 A very useful 4.3 dB reduction in noise is gained by going to 2k2, at zero cost, but after that 
the improvements become smaller, for while Johnson noise and the effects of current noise 
are reduced, the voltage noise of the opamp is unchanged. 
 It is instructive to compare the signal/noise ratio with that of a balanced link. We will put 
1 Vrms (2.2 dBu) down a balanced link. The balanced output stage raises the level by 6 dB, 
so we have 8.2 dBu going down the cable. A conventional unity-gain balanced input made 
with 10 kΩ resistors and a 5532 section has a noise output of 104.8 dBu, so the signal/noise 
ratio is 8.2  104.8  113.0 dB. 
 In the ground-cancel case, if we use 1 kΩ resistors as in the fourth row of  Table 19.1 , 
the noise from the ground-cancel output stage is 112.2 dBu. Adding the noise of the

5532 buffer at the receiving end in  Figure 19.5 , which is 125.7 dBu, we get 112.0 dBu 
as the noise floor. The signal/noise ratio is therefore 2.2  112.0  114.2 dB. This is 
1.2 dB quieter than the conventional balanced link, and it only uses two opamp sections 
instead of three. 
 The noise situation could easily be reversed by using a low-impedance balanced input with 
buffers to make the input impedance acceptably high, as described in the previous chapter, 
but we are then comparing a ground-cancel link using two opamp sections with a balanced 
link using five. 
 Balanced outputs: basics 
 Figure 19.8a shows a balanced output, where the cold terminal carries the same signal as the 
hot terminal but phase-inverted. This can be arranged simply by using an opamp stage to invert 
the normal in-phase output. The resistors R3, R4 around the inverter should be as low in value 
as possible to minimise Johnson noise, because this stage is working at a noise-gain of two, but 
bear in mind that R3 is effectively grounded at one end and its loading, as well as the external 
load, must be driven by the first opamp. A unity-gain follower is shown for the first amplifier, 
but this can be any other shunt or series feedback stage as convenient. The inverting output if 
not required can be ignored; it must  not be grounded, because the inverting opamp will then 
spend most of its time clipping in current-limiting, probably injecting unpleasant distortion 
into the preamp grounding system. Both hot and cold outputs must have the same output 
impedances (R2, R6) to keep the line impedances balanced and the interconnection CMRR 
maximised.  
 A balanced output has the advantage that the total signal level on the line is increased by 
6 dB, which will improve the signal-to-noise ratio if a balanced input amplifier is being 
driven, as they are relatively noisy. It is also less likely to crosstalk to other lines even if they 
are unbalanced, as the currents injected via the stray capacitance from each line will tend to 
cancel; how well this works depends on the physical layout of the conductors. All balanced 
outputs give the facility of correcting phase errors by swapping hot and cold outputs. This 
is however a two-edged sword, because it is probably how the phase got wrong in the 
first place. 
 There is no need to worry about the exact symmetry of level for the two output signals; 
ordinary tolerance resistors are fine. Such gain errors only affect the signal-handling capacity 
of the interconnection by a small amount. This simple form of balanced output is the norm 
in hi-fi balanced interconnection, but is less common in professional audio, where the quasi-
floating output described later gives more flexibility.

546 Chapter 19
 Balanced outputs: output impedance 
 The balanced output stage of  Figure 19.8a has an output impedance of 68 Ω on both legs because 
this is the value of the series output resistors; however, as noted earlier, the lower the output 
impedance the better, so long as stability is maintained. This balanced output configuration can 
be easily adapted to have two zero-impedance outputs, as shown in  Figure 19.8b . The unity-gain 
buffer that drives the hot output is configured in the same way as the 10 dB zero-impedance 
stage described earlier. The zero-impedance inverter that drives the cold output works 
similarly, but with shunt negative feedback via R4. 
 The quickest way to measure normal output impedances is to load each output as heavily as 
is practical (say with 560 Ω) and measure the voltage drop compared with the unloaded state. 
From this the output impedance is simply calculated. However, in the case of zero-impedance 
outputs the voltage drop is very small and so measurement accuracy is poor. 
 A more sophisticated technique is the injection of a test signal current into the output and 
measuring the voltage that results. This is much more informative; the results for the hot 
output in  Figure 19.8b are given in  Figure 19.9 . A suitable current to inject is 1 mA rms, 
 Figure 19.9 : The signal voltage at the hot output of the balanced ampliﬁ er for 1 mA rms injection 
current, and the output impedance modulus. Three values of output capacitor 

Line outputs 547
defined by applying 1 Vrms to a 1 kΩ injection resistor. A 1 Ω output impedance will 
therefore givxe an output signal voltage of 1 mVrms (60 dBV), which can be easily 
measured; see  Figure 19.9 . Likewise 40 dBV represents 10 Ω, and 80 dBV represents 
0.1 Ω; a log scale is useful because it allows a wide range of impedance to be displayed and 
gives convenient straight lines on the plot. The opamp sections were both LM4562.  
 In  Figure 19.9 the modulus of the output impedance falls to below 0.1 Ω between 1 and 
5 kHz. The rise above the latter frequency is due to the effect of C2 in Figure 19.8b, and the 
open-loop gain of the opamp falling as frequency increases. Below 3 kHz the impedance 
increases steadily as frequency falls, doubling with each octave due to the reactance of the 
output capacitor. This effect can be reduced simply by increasing the size of the capacitor. 
In  Figure 19.9 the results are shown for 220 μF, 470 μF, and 1000 μF output capacitors. For 
1000 μF a broad null occurs reaching down to 0.03 Ω, and the output impedance is below 1 Ω 
between 150 Hz and 20 kHz. Bear in mind that output capacitors should be non-polarised 
types, as they may face external DC voltages of either polarity, and should be rated at no less 
than 25 V; this means that a 1000 μF capacitor can be quite a large component. 
 The output impedance plot for the cold output was identical to  Figure 19.9 . This was rather 
a surprise as the inverter works at a noise-gain of two times, as opposed to the buffer which 
works at a noise-gain of unity, and so I expected it to show twice the output impedance above 
5 kHz. It is not currently known why this is not so. 
 Since wiring resistances internal to the equipment are likely to be in the region 0.1 to 0.5 Ω 
there seems nothing much to be gained by reducing the output impedances any further than is 
achieved by this simple zero-impedance technique. 
 You may be thinking that the zero-impedance output is a bit of a risky business; will it 
always be stable when loaded with capacitance? In my wide experience of this technique, 
the answer is yes, so long as you design it properly. If you are attempting something 
different from proven circuitry, it is always wise to check the stability of zero-impedance 
outputs with a variety of load capacitances. In the example of  Figure 19.8b both hot and 
cold outputs were separately checked using a 5 Vrms sweep from 50 kHz to 10 Hz, with 
load capacitances of: 470 pF, 1 nF, 2n2, 10 nF, 22 nF and 100 nF. At no point was there the 
slightest hint of instability. A load of 100 nF is of course grossly excessive compared with 
real use, being equivalent to about 1000 metres of average screened cable, and curtails the 
output swing at HF. 
 Balanced outputs: noise 
 The noise output of the zero-impedance balanced output of  Figure 19.8b was measured with 
0 Ω source resistance, rms response, unweighted; measured at two bandwidths to demonstrate 
the absence of hum; the opamp sections were both LM4562. See  Table 19.2.    

548 Chapter 19
 Quasi-ﬂ oating outputs 
 The purely electronic output stage in  Figure 19.10 emulates a floating transformer winding; 
if both hot and cold outputs are driving signal lines, then the outputs are balanced, as 
if a centre-tapped output transformer were being used, though clearly the output is not 
galvanically isolated from ground. If, however, the cold output is grounded, the hot output 
doubles in amplitude so the total level hot-to-cold is unchanged. This condition is detected by 
the current-sensing feedback taken from the outside of the 75 Ω resistor R10, and the current 
driven into the shorted cold output is automatically reduced to a low level that will not cause 
problems. 
 Similarly, if the hot output is grounded, the cold output doubles in amplitude and remains 
out of phase; the total hot–cold signal level is once more unchanged. This system has the 
advantage that it can give the same level into either a balanced or unbalanced input, given 
an appropriate connector at the input end. 6 dB of headroom is however lost when the 
output is used in unbalanced mode. It is most useful in recording studios where various bits 
of equipment may be temporarily connected; it is of less value in a PA system with a fixed 
equipment line-up. 
 When an unbalanced output is being driven, the quasi-floating output can be wired to work as 
a ground-cancelling connection, with rejection of ground noise no less effective than the true 
balanced mode. This requires the cold output to be grounded at the remote (input) end of the 
cable. Under adverse conditions this might cause HF instability, but in general the approach 
is sound. If you are using exceptionally long cable, then it is wise to check that all is well. 
 If the cold output is grounded locally, i.e. at the sending end of the cable, then it works as a 
simple unbalanced output, with no noise rejection. When a quasi-floating output stage is used 
unbalanced, the cold leg  must be grounded, or common-mode noise will degrade the noise 
floor by at least 10 dB, and there may be other problems with increased distortion. 
 Quasi-floating outputs use a rather subtle mixture of positive and negative feedback of current 
and voltage. This performs the required function quite well, but a serious drawback is that it

accentuates the effect of resistor tolerances, and so a preset resistor is normally required to set 
the outputs for equal amplitude; the usual arrangement is shown in  Figure 19.10 . If it is not 
correctly adjusted one side of the output will clip before the other and reduce the total output 
headroom. This is a set-and-forget adjustment unless it becomes necessary to change any of 
the resistors in the circuit.  
 Transformer balanced outputs 
 If true galvanic isolation between equipment grounds is required, this can only be achieved 
with a line transformer, sometimes called a line isolating transformer. You don’t use line 
transformers unless you really have to because the much-discussed cost, weight, and 
performance problems are very real, as you will see shortly. However, they are sometimes 
found in big sound reinforcement systems (for example, in the mic-splitter box on the stage) 
and in any environment where high RF field strengths are encountered.  
 A basic transformer balanced output is shown in  Figure 19.11a ; in practice A1 would 
probably be providing gain rather than just buffering. In good-quality line transformers 
 Figure 19.10:  Quasi-ﬂ oating balanced output 

550 Chapter 19
there will be an inter-winding screen, which should be earthed to minimise noise pickup and 
general EMC problems. In most cases this does  not ground the external can and you have to 
arrange this yourself, possibly by mounting the can in a metal capacitor clip. Make sure the 
can is grounded as this definitely does reduce noise pickup .
 Be aware that the output impedance will be higher than usual because of the ohmic resistance 
of the transformer windings. With a 1:1 transformer, as normally used, both the primary 
and secondary winding resistances are effectively in series with the output. A small line 
transformer can easily have 60 Ω per winding, so the output impedance is 120 Ω plus the 
value of the series resistance R1 added to the primary circuit to prevent HF instability due 
to transformer winding capacitances and line capacitances. The total can easily be 160 Ω or 
more, compared with, say, 47 Ω for non-transformer output stages. This will mean a higher 
output impedance and greater voltage losses when driving heavy loads. 
 DC flowing through the primary winding of a transformer is bad for linearity, and if your 
opamp output has anything more than the usual small offset voltages on it, DC current flow 
should be stopped by a blocking capacitor. 
 Output transformer frequency response 
 If you have looked at the section in  Chapter 18 on the frequency response of line input 
transformers, you will recall that they give a nastily peaking frequency response if the 
secondary is not loaded properly, due to resonance between the leakage inductance and the 
stray winding capacitances. Exactly the same problem afflicts output transformers, as shown 
in  Figure 19.12 ; with no output loading there is a frightening 14 dB peak at 127 kHz. It is 
high enough in frequency to have very little effect on the response at 20 kHz, but this high-Q 
resonance isn’t the sort of horror you want lurking in your circuitry. It could easily cause 
some nasty EMC problems.  
 The transformer measured was a Sowter 3292 1:1 line isolating transformer. Sowter are 
a highly respected company, and this is a quality part with a mumetal core and housed in 
 Figure 19.11:  Transformer balanced outputs; a) standard circuit, b) zero-impedance drive to 
reduce LF distortion, also with Zobel network across secondary 

Line outputs 551
a mumetal can for magnetic shielding. When used as the manufacturer intended, with a 
600 Ω load on the secondary, the results are predictably quite different, with a well-controlled 
roll-off that I measured as 0.5 dB at 20 kHz. 
 The difficulty is that there are very few, if any, genuine 600 Ω loads left in the world, and 
most output transformers are going to be driving much higher impedances. If we are driving 
a 10 kΩ load, the secondary resonance is not much damped and we still get a thoroughly 
unwelcome 7 dB peak above 100 kHz, as shown in  Figure 19.12 . We could, of course, put 
a permanent 600 Ω load across the secondary, but that will heavily load the output opamp, 
impairing its linearity, and will give us unwelcome signal loss due in the winding resistances. 
It is also a profoundly inelegant way of carrying on. 
 A better answer, as in the case of the line input transformer, is to put a Zobel network, i.e. a 
series combination of resistor and capacitor, across the secondary, as in  Figure 19.11b . The 
capacitor required is quite small and will cause very little loading except at high frequencies 
where signal amplitudes are low. A little experimentation yielded the values of 1 kΩ in series 
with 15 nF, which gives the much improved response shown in  Figure 19.12 . The response is 
almost exactly 0.0 dB at 20 kHz, at the cost of a very gentle 0.1 dB rise around 10 kHz; this 
 Figure 19.12 : Frequency response of a Sowter 3292 output transformer with various loads on 
the secondary. Zero-impedance drive as in Figure 19.8b 

552 Chapter 19
could probably be improved by a little more tweaking of the Zobel values. Be aware that a 
different transformer type will require different values. 
 Output transformer distortion 
 Transformers have well-known problems with linearity at low frequencies. This is because 
the voltage induced into the secondary winding depends on the rate of change of the magnetic 
field in the core, and so the lower the frequency, the greater the change in magnitude must be 
for transformer action [1]. The current drawn by the primary winding to establish this field 
is non-linear, because of the well-known non-linearity of iron cores. If the primary had zero 
resistance, and was fed from a zero source impedance, as much distorted current as was needed 
would be drawn and no one would ever know there was a problem. But there is always some 
primary resistance, and this alters the primary current drawn so that third-harmonic distortion 
is introduced into the magnetic field established, and so into the secondary output voltage. 
Very often there is a series resistance R1 deliberately inserted into the primary circuit, with the 
intention of avoiding HF instability; this makes the LF distortion problem worse, and a better 
means of isolation is a low value inductor of say 4 μH in parallel with a low-value damping 
resistor of around 47 Ω. This is more expensive and is only used on high-end consoles. 
 An important point is that this distortion does not appear only with heavy loading – it is 
there all the time, even with no load at all on the secondary; it is not analogous to loading the 
output of a solid-state power amplifier, which invariably increases the distortion. In fact, in 
my experience transformer LF distortion is slightly better when the secondary is connected to 
its rated load resistance. With no secondary load, the transformer appears as a big inductance, 
so as frequency falls the current drawn increases, until with circuits like  Figure 19.11a , there 
is a sudden steep increase in distortion around 10–20 Hz as the opamp hits its output current 
limits. Before this happens, the distortion from the transformer itself will be gross. 
 To demonstrate this I did some distortion tests on the same Sowter 3292 transformer that was 
examined for frequency response. The winding resistance for both primary and secondary 
is about 59 Ω. It is quite a small component, 34 mm in diameter and 24 mm high and 
weighing 45 gm, and is obviously not intended for transferring large amounts of power at low 
frequencies.  Figure 19.13 shows the LF distortion with no series resistance, driven directly 
from a 5532 output (there were no HF stability problems in this case, but it might be different 
with cables connected to the secondary) and with 47 and 100 Ω added in series with the 
primary. The flat part to the right is the noise floor. 
 Taking 200 Hz as an example, adding 47 Ω in series increases the THD from 0.0045% to 
0.0080%, figures which are in exactly the same ratio as the total resistances in the primary 
circuit in the two cases. It’s very satisfying when a piece of theory slots right home like that. 
Predictably, a 100 Ω series resistor gives even more distortion, namely 0.013% at 200 Hz, 
and once more proportional to the total primary resistance.  

Line outputs 553
 If you’re used to the near-zero LF distortion of opamps, you may not be too impressed with 
 Figure 19.13 , but this is the reality of output transformers. The results are well within the 
manufacturer’s specifications for a high-quality part. Note that the distortion rises rapidly 
to the LF end, roughly tripling as frequency halves. It also increases fast with level, roughly 
quadrupling as level doubles. Having gone to some pains to make electronics with very low 
distortion, this non-linearity at the very end of the signal chain is distinctly irritating. The 
situation is somewhat eased in actual use as signal levels in the bottom octave of audio are 
normally about 10–12 dB lower than the maximum amplitudes at higher frequencies. 
 Reducing output transformer distortion 
 In audio electronics, as in so many other areas of life, there is often a choice between using 
brains or brawn to tackle a problem. In this case ‘brawn’ means a bigger transformer, such 
as the Sowter 3991, which is still 34 mm in diameter but 37 mm high, weighing in at 80 gm. 
The extra mumetal core material improves the LF performance, but you still get a distortion 
plot very much like  Figure 19.13 (with the same increase of THD with series resistance) 
 Figure 19.13 : The LF distortion rise for a 3292 Sowter transformer, without (0R) and with (47 Ω 
and 100 Ω) extra series resistance. Signal level 1 Vrms

except now it occurs at 2 Vrms instead of 1 Vrms. Twice the metal, twice the level – I 
suppose it makes sense. You can take this approach a good deal further with the Sowter 
4231, a much bigger open-frame design tipping the scales at a hefty 350 gm. The winding 
resistance for the primary is 12 Ω and for the secondary 13.3 Ω, both a good deal lower than 
the previous figures. 
 Figure 19.14 shows the LF distortion for the 4231 with no series resistance, and with 
47 and 100 Ω added in series with the primary. The flat part to the right is the noise floor. 
Comparing it with  Figure 19.13 , the basic distortion at 30 Hz is now 0.032%, compared with 
about 0.10% for the 3292 transformer. While this is a useful improvement it is gained at 
considerable expense. Now adding 47 Ω of series resistance has dreadful results – distortion 
increases by about five times. This is because the lower winding resistances of the 4231 mean 
that the added 47 Ω has increased the total resistance in the primary circuit to five times what 
it was. Predictably, adding a 100 Ω series resistance approximately doubles the distortion 
again. In general bigger transformers have thicker wire in the windings, and this in itself 
reduces the effect of the basic core non-linearity, quite apart from the improvement due to 
more core material. A lower winding resistance also means a lower output impedance.

  The LF non-linearity in  Figure 19.14 is still most unsatisfactory compared with that of the 
electronics. Since the ‘My policy is copper and iron!’ [2] approach does not really solve the 
problem, we’d better put brawn to one side and try what brains we can muster. 
 We have seen that adding series resistance to ensure HF stability makes things definitely 
worse, and a better means of isolation is a low value inductor of say 4 μH paralleled with 
a low-value damping resistor of around 47 Ω. However inductors cost money and a more 
economic solution is to use a zero-impedance output as shown in  Figure 19.11b above. This 
gives the same results as no series resistance at all, but with wholly dependable HF stability. 
However, the basic transformer distortion remains because the primary winding resistance is 
still there, and its level is still too high. What can be done? 
 The LF distortion can be reduced by applying negative feedback via a tertiary transformer 
winding, but this usually means an expensive custom transformer, and there may be some 
interesting HF stability problems because of the extra phase-shift introduced into the 
feedback by the tertiary winding; this approach is discussed in reference [3]. However, what 
we really want is a technique that will work with off-the-shelf transformers. 
 A better way is to cancel out the transformer primary resistance by putting in series an 
electronically-generated negative resistance; the principle is shown in  Figure 19.15 , where a 
zero-impedance output is used to eliminate the effect of the series stability resistor. The 56 Ω 
resistor R4 senses the current through the primary, and provides positive feedback to A1, 
proportioned so that a negative output resistance of twice the value of R4 is produced, which 
 Figure 19.15:  Reducing LF distortion by cancelling out the primary winding resistance with a 
negative resistance generated by current-sensing resistance R4. Values for Sowter 3292 transformer 

556 Chapter 19
will cancel out both R4 itself and most of the primary winding resistance. As we saw earlier, 
the primary winding resistance of the 3292 transformer is approx 59 Ω, so if R4 was 59 Ω we 
should get complete cancellation. But . . .  
 It has always necessary to use positive feedback with caution. Typically it works, as here, 
in conjunction with good old-fashioned negative feedback, but if the positive exceeds 
the negative (this is one time you do  not want to accentuate the positive) then the circuit 
will typically latch up solid, with the output jammed up against one of the supply rails. 
R4  56 Ω in  Figure 19.15 worked reliably in all my tests, but increasing it to 68 Ω caused 
immediate problems, which is precisely what you would expect. No input DC-blocking 
capacitor is shown in  Figure 19.15 but it can be added ahead of R1 without increasing the 
potential latch-up problems. The small Sowter 3292 transformer was used. 
 This circuit is only a basic demonstration of the principle of cancelling primary resistance, 
but as  Figure 19.16 shows it is still highly effective. The distortion at 100 Hz is reduced by a 
factor of five, and at 200 Hz by a factor of four. Since this is achieved by adding one resistor, 
I think this counts as a definite triumph of brains over brawn, and indeed confirmation of the 
old adage that size is less important than technique.

resistance cancellation as in Figure 19.15. Signal level 1 Vrms 

Line outputs 557
 The method is sometimes called ‘mixed feedback’ as it can be looked at as a mixture of 
voltage and current feedback. Since the primary resistance is cancelled, there is a second 
advantage as the output impedance of the stage is reduced. The secondary winding resistance 
is, however, still in circuit, and so the output impedance is usually only halved.  The principle 
can also be applied when a balanced drive to the output transformer is used.
 If you want better performance than this – and it is possible to make transformer non-linearity 
effectively invisible down to 15 Vrms at 10 Hz – there are several deeper issues to consider.

 Driving heavy loads 
 This chapter focuses on techniques for driving loads heavier than can be handled by a single 
5532 or LM4562 opamp–basically any impedance less than 500 Ω. This is typically a 
headphone load, the impedance of headphones varying widely from 600 Ω to 16 Ω or less, 
with sensitivity inversely related so the higher impedance models need more drive voltage. 
The need to drive impedances below 500 Ω is also likely to arise in very low-noise designs, 
so that special measures have to be taken just to drive the next stage. A good example is my 
Preamp 2012 design for Elektor [1]. It is assumed here that the heavy loads must be driven to 
the same high standards of noise and distortion that are required for lighter loading. 
 In writing this chapter I have become conscious that it would be easy to find enough material 
for a complete book on headphone amplifiers. Inevitably I have had to be very selective, but I 
think you will find plenty of new information here. 
 Driving headphones 
 The wide range of load impedances is accompanied by a wide range of sensitivity. 
Headphones of 600 Ω impedance require ten times or more voltage to achieve the same sound 
pressure level (SPL) than do those of 30 Ω impedance, though there is much variation. The 
sensitivity of most of the headphones currently on the market is covered by a range of 110 to 
130 dB SPL per Volt. If a rather loud 110 dB SPL is taken as the maximum level required, 
voltages between 110 mV and 1.1 V will be needed. These are low voltages compared with 
the maximum of about 10 Vrms that can be obtained from standard ±17 V rails, and you may 
be thinking that it would be more efficient to run a headphone amplifier off much lower rails, 
such as ±5 V. While this is true, it is rarely done, as a) it is much easier to get low distortion 
with the standard rails, and b) extra power supplies are expensive to provide. 
 The traditional solution to the wide impedance/sensitivity range is a resistor of the order 
of 50 Ω to 100 Ω in series with the amplifier output, which reduces the maximum output 
voltage available as the load impedance is reduced. This has a valuable safety function as 
applying the full voltage required for 600 Ω headphones to 30 Ω units will almost certainly 

560 Chapter 20
wreck them, as well as generating SPLs that will cause hearing damage. The series-resistor 
technique has been used extensively, despite the fact that it reduces the so-called ‘damping 
factor’ of the amplifier-headphone combination to about 0.3. The ‘damping factor’ of a 
power amplifier-loudspeaker combination is a meaningless ratio because the amplifier 
output impedance is a tiny fraction of the loudspeaker voice-coil resistance, so the latter 
utterly dominates the transient behaviour; here the amplifier output impedance is greater 
than that of the transducer, and therefore could be expected to have a serious effect on 
its frequency response and transient behaviour. Nevertheless, this technique has been in 
wide use for many decades; there seems to be a general feeling that ‘damping factor’ does 
not apply to headphones, though it is far from clear why this should be the case. It also 
seems to be the general view that capacitor-coupled outputs are acceptable for headphones, 
but not full-scale power amplifiers. There is some technical justification for this as large 
electrolytic capacitors can introduce distortion when passing large signal currents, even at 
mid-frequencies [2]. 
 The series-resistor approach has two other important advantages. Firstly, so long as the 
resistor has a sufficient power rating, the headphone amplifier is inherently short circuit proof 
without any need for protection circuitry that might, if ill-conceived, degrade the distortion 
performance by premature operation. DC-offset protection may still be required. Secondly, 
the amplifier should be stable into any conceivable load without the need for Zobel networks 
or output inductors. 
 A solution to the output impedance problem is to retain the series resistor but take the 
negative feedback from the load side of it. This will give a very low output impedance (see 
the zero-impedance outputs in  Chapter 19 ) but retains the power-limiting action and inherent 
immunity to short circuits. However, a Zobel network and output inductor are now likely to 
be required for reliable stability with all loads. 
 Special opamps 
 Opamps do exist with a greater load-driving capability (for example, the NJM4556A from 
JRC is capable of driving 150 Ω) but this device seems to have achieved little market 
penetration, possibly because its linearity even into light loads is distinctly inferior to the 
5532 and LM4562. By 2009 none of the usual distributors were carrying it, and it is not clear 
if it is still in production. 
 Multiple opamps 
 In some circumstances, paralleled opamp stages are the simplest answer. This is sometimes 
called an opamp-array or multipath amplifier. There is much more information on this in 
 Chapter 1 , focusing mainly on the noise benefits; here I will concentrate on load-driving 

Headphone ampliﬁ ers 561
ability. In  Figure 20.1 the upper trace shows a single 5532 section attempting to drive 5 Vrms 
into 220 Ω. The distortion is very high for a 5532, and it is clearly running out of current 
capability. Adding a second section in parallel with the outputs coupled by 10 Ω resistors, as 
shown in Figure 1.10 in  Chapter 1 , drops the THD back to the familiar low levels. The gains 
of the paralleled voltage-follower stages are very closely equal, so the small series output 
resistors can allow for any microscopic differences, and no significant currents pass from 
opamp to opamp.  
 This can be a very simple and cost-effective way to solve the problem of driving medium 
loads, and it can be extended by connecting more 5532 sections in parallel, essentially 
without limit.  Figure 20.2 shows four parallel 5532 sections driving 100 Ohms to 
5 Vrms with very little distortion. An array of 12 parallel 5532 sections can drive a 25 Ω 
load with 5 Vrms very effectively. Being me, I took the opamp-array technique to its 
logical conclusion, and possibly beyond, in my power amplifier for Elektor [3] which 
used 32 opamp packages, giving 64 parallel sections of 5532 joined with 1 Ω sharing 
resistors. This can easily drive an 8 Ω loudspeaker to 15 Wrms, with the usual very low 
5532 distortion. The opamp supply rails limit the power output, so another version was 
designed that used two of these amplifiers bridged to give about 60 W/8 Ω; the number 
of opamps in each amplifier was doubled to cope with the doubled load currents, so 
there were 128-off 5532 sections in parallel with 1 Ω sharing resistors. This project was 
completely straightforward to design and test, and I think demonstrates conclusively that 
you can use as many parallel opamps as you like.

562 Chapter 20
 Since the 5532 is usually the cheapest opamp available, using a number of them is not 
costly. The LM4562 will unquestionably give lower distortion but at the time of writing is 
significantly more expensive. 
 The best linearity is given by separating the gain and load driving functions, as shown in 
 Figure 20.5 further on. The first opamp provides all the voltage gain, so the output amps can 
be operated as voltage-followers with 100% negative feedback to give the best linearity.  
 As described in  Chapter 1 , paralleled opamps not only increase drive capability but 
also reduce noise and allow a lower effective output impedance when driving capacitive 
loads. 
 Opamp-transistor hybrid ampliﬁ ers 
 When lower headphone impedances are to be driven, the number of multiple opamps 
required can become unwieldy, taking up an excessive amount of PCB area, and it becomes 
more economical to adopt a hybrid circuit (these are ‘hybrid’ circuits in that they combine 
IC opamps with discrete transistors; the name does not refer to thick-film construction 
or anything like that). The usual procedure is to add a Class-AB output stage after the 
opamp. A Class-A output stage is perfectly feasible if ultimate quality is required, though 
the power consumption is naturally much higher, and the efficiency with real signals 
something like 1%. The discrete devices could be either bipolar transistors or power FETs,

but I invariably use bipolar transistors because their greater transconductance translates 
into better linearity, and they are totally predictable in every parameter that matters for this 
application. 
 I have always made it clear that Class-B and Class-AB in a power amplifier are not the 
same thing. Class-B is that unique quiescent condition where the distortion is a minimum. 
Class-AB is more highly biased so that it is effectively Class-A for small outputs, but above 
that extra distortion is generated as the output devices switch on and off. Here the situation is 
very different; instead of the driver-output device pairs of a power amplifier, there is a single 
transistor that turns on and off more gradually. There is no real distinction between Class-B 
and AB, and no need for critical biasing. 
 The arrangement in  Figure 20.3 has been used for many years, dating back to when using 
a TL072 for the opamp made a significant cost saving. It is economical and dependable 
and I have used it to drive headphones in low-cost mixing consoles. The output stage 
is the simplest possible version of Class-AB, but it really works quite well, though its 
distortion characteristics, as seen in  Figure 20.4 , are not of the highest standard. The 
output devices are TO92 small-signal types with high beta, and this is crucial to an 
acceptable distortion performance; the bias is set by D1, D2 and there is no adjustment. 
The gain is 3.2 times. Inserting extra stages into opamp feedback loops must be done with 
 Figure 20.3:  Traditional hybrid headphone ampliﬁ er combining a TL072 with a discrete Class-B 
output stage. Note the series output resistor R7, with typical value 

564 Chapter 20
care, to avoid adding extra phase-shifts that may cause HF instability; here there are no 
problems, and no extra stabilising components are required. The output is AC coupled by 
C2 so that DC-offset protection is not required, and output resistor R7 takes care of short 
circuit protection, and caters for the different drive voltages required by 600 Ω and 30 Ω 
headphones.  
 Figure 20.5 shows a more sophisticated version, with lower distortion and greater output 
into lower impedances. I have deployed it in preamplifiers with a headphone output. 
There are three TO92 output pairs giving greater drive power; no heatsinks are required. 
The gain is higher than in   Figure 20.3   at 5.4 times (14.6 dB), and is provided by A1, 
allowing A2 to work at unity closed-loop gain so there is maximal negative feedback 
for correcting errors in the output stage. Bootstrapping is added to R4, R7 to maintain a 
more constant current through bias components D1, R5. C3 aids stability; at very high 
frequencies the NFB is taken from before the output stage and does therefore not suffer 
phase-shifts from it. This circuit is reliably HF stable with a 5532 for A2; an LM4562 
in this position showed hints of instability but this may be curable by adjusting C3. The 
noise output was measured at 107.0 dBu, so the EIN is 107.0 14.6  121.6 dBu, 
which is pleasingly low.  
 The distortion performance is shown in  Figure 20.6 , without use of a series output 
resistor. The 5 Vrms trace is higher due to the relatively higher noise level with a smaller 
output.

 Discrete Class-AB headphone ampliﬁ ers 
 The hybrid circuit of  Figure 20.5 is relatively complicated, and one starts to wonder if a 
wholly discrete solution might be more economical.  Figure 20.7 shows a discrete headphone 
amplifier based on the discrete opamp designs of  Chapter 3 . The output stage is a simple 
complementary Class-AB configuration with fixed bias.  
 First we will look at the basic linearity with light loading. With a 3 kΩ load, the distortion 
residual at 1 kHz looks nothing like the characteristic crossover distortion seen in a power 
amplifier. It is pure third harmonic. This situation continues all the way up to 20 kHz, the 
residual remaining as pure third harmonic but increasing in relative level.  
 The distortion with light loading can be reduced dramatically by increasing the quiescent 
current in the output stage, by adding a biasing resistor in series with the two diodes in the 
VAS collector circuit, as shown  in Figure 20.7 .  Figure 20.8 demonstrates that HF distortion 
falls steadily as the value of the bias resistor increases, with no obvious sign of an optimal 
value. A 10 Ω resistor only gives a modest improvement but 27 Ω reduces HF distortion by 
a factor of 5, and 56 Ω seems to give most of the improvement that is attainable. The latter 
corresponds to a quiescent current of 4.6 mA in the output devices. While in this form it 
makes a very useful model amplifier for studying the small-signal stages of power amplifiers, 
its distortion increases rapidly when heavier loads are driven  .

and 68 Ω, 20 dBu output, ±20 V rails 
    Figure 20.9   shows distortion remains low for a 220 Ω load, but increases rapidly for heavier 
loading as the output stage is taken out of its Class-A region, and the THD residual becomes 
a complex mixture of higher harmonics, increasing at 6 dB/octave with frequency. When 
comparing this with other designs, be aware that the closed-loop gain is higher at 23 times. 
 Discrete Class-A headphone ampliﬁ ers 
 Because the power requirements of headphone amplifiers are quite modest, it is quite practical 
to adopt a headphone amplifier design that works in pure Class-A. This assumes that push-
pull Class-A is used to get the maximum efficiency. Even so, with real music signals the 
efficiency is likely to be as low as 1% at full volume, and even less at lower levels. 
 Figure 20.10 shows another development of the discrete opamp using a Class-A output stage. 
The high quiescent dissipation means that TO-220 output transistors must be used; since 
these have relatively low beta they are paired with TO-92 driver transistors, the result looking 

 Figure 20.10:  Class-A hybrid headphone ampliﬁ er with EF output stage 

570 Chapter 20
very like a full-scale power amplifier. The quiescent current is set at 90 mA by the bias 
generator Q9 and fixed resistors R12, R16, R17. No bias adjustment is required as in Class-A 
the quiescent current is not critical. 
 In the prototype a small vertical heatsink with a thermal resistance of 10 C/W (type SW38) 
was used for each output device, with the bias transistor Q9 mounted not just on the same 
heatsink, but actually on top of output device Q12 for the best thermal coupling. The standard 
clip can still be used to hold the devices to the heatsink. From cold turn-on to full operating 
temperature the quiescent remains within ±10%. A feedback control system could hold the 
quiescent current much more closely than this [4], but its complexity is hardly necessary at 
such modest powers. No short circuit protection is required because the output resistance 
R20, made up of two 33 Ω 750 mW resistors in series, can safely absorb the power if the 
output is shorted.  
 The distortion driving a 30 Ω load at 3 Vrms out is shown in  Figure 20.11 . The THD at 
10 kHz is 0.0008%, comfortably below 0.001%, and predominantly second-harmonic. The 
maximum output is 3.3 Vrms, due to the effect of the output resistor.

 Balanced headphone ampliﬁ ers 
 It is believed by a small minority that a balanced drive to headphones can be of advantage. It 
is difficult to think of any technical reason why this might be so, because the moving coil 
speaker elements are not connected to anything except the connections feeding them, so the 
presence of a common-mode voltage is irrelevant. 
 Most headphones will need to be rewired for balanced use, as the typical arrangement for 
high-quality headphones is to have a 3-wire cable running from a ¼-inch jack plug to one 

572 Chapter 20
ear-piece, with a 2-wire cable running from there to the other ear-piece. This means that part of 
the ground connection is common to the left and right signals, and since it has some resistance 
it will cause interchannel crosstalk. Paradoxically, cheap headphones with a figure-of-eight 
cable that splits off to each ear-piece may be better in this respect because there are separate 
grounds to each ear-piece, and these only meet up at the jack plug, so there is the minimum 
amount of common ground resistance. 
 Four-way jack plugs do exist (with tip, two rings, and sleeve) but connection to headphones 
wired for balanced use is normally made with two 3-pin XLR connectors.

 Signal switching 
 The switching and routing of analogue signals is a fundamental part of signal processing, but 
not one that is easily implemented if accuracy and precision are required. This article focuses 
on audio applications, but the basic parameters such as isolation and linearity are equally 
relevant in many fields. 
 Mechanical switches 
 A mechanical switch normally makes a solid unequivocal connection when it is closed, and 
it is as ‘on’ as the resistance of its contacts and connections allows; these are small fractions 
of an Ohm and are unlikely to cause trouble in small-signal audio design. Switches are, 
however, in general terms a good deal less ‘off’. The insulation resistance may be measured 
in peta-ohms, but what does the damage is the inevitable capacitance between contacts. This 
is usually small in pF, but quite large enough to dominate the degree of offness obtainable at 
high audio frequencies. Its effects naturally depend on the impedance at the ‘receiving’ side 
of the switch. For all the tests discussed here this was 10 kΩ. 
 Using an ALPS SPUN type push switch, at 10 kHz the offness is only 66 dB, and 
grounding the unused side of the switch only improves the offness by about 2 dB. A graph of 
the result can be seen in  Chapter 22 ; the offness naturally degrades by 6 dB/octave. Switch 
capacitance is an important issue in designing mixer routing systems. 
 In another test a miniature 3-way slide switch gave 70 dB at 10 kHz. Once again, 
grounding the unused contact at the end of the switch only gave a 4 dB improvement, and it 
is wise to assume that in general grounding unused switch sections will not help much. 
 Switch inter-contact capacitance is quite easy to determine; measure the offness, i.e. the loss 
of the RC circuit, and since R is known C can be calculated easily. Once it is known for a 
given switch construction, it is easy to calculate the offness for different loading resistances. 
Interestingly, the inter-contact capacitance of switches seems to be relatively constant, even 
though they vary widely in size and construction. This seems to be because the smaller 
switches have smaller contacts, with a smaller area, but on the other hand they are closer 
together. 

574 Chapter 21
 Input-select switching 
 Some time ago, Morgan Jones [1] raised the excellent point of crosstalk in the input-select 
switching of preamplifiers. If the source impedance is significant, then this may be a serious 
problem. While I agree that his use of a rotary switch with twice the required number of 
positions and grounding alternate contacts is slightly superior to the conventional use of 
rotary switches, measuring a popular Lorlin switch type showed the improvement to be only 
5 dB. I am also unhappy with all those redundant ‘mute’ positions between input selections, 
so when I design a preamp I normally choose interlocked push-switches rather than a rotary 
switch. A 4-changeover format can then be used to reduce crosstalk. 
 The problem with conventional input select systems like  Figure 21.1a is that the various input 
tracks necessarily come into close proximity, with significant crosstalk through capacitance

C stray to the common side of the switch, i.e. from A to B. Using two changeovers per input 
side (i.e. four for stereo) allows the intermediate connection B-C to be grounded by the NC 
contact of the first switch section, and keeps the ‘hot’ input A much further away from the 
common input line D, as shown in  Figure 21.1b . C stray is now much smaller. 
 The crosstalk data in  Table 21.1 was gathered at 10 kHz, with 10 KΩ loading resistances: 
 The emphasis here is on minimising crosstalk between different sources carrying different 
signals, as interchannel (L–R) crosstalk is benign by comparison. Interchannel isolation is 
limited by the placement of left and right channels on the same switch, with the contact rows 
parallel, and limits L–R isolation to 66 dB at 10 kHz with a high 10 kΩ source impedance. 
Actual source impedances are likely to be lower, with both inter-source and inter-channel 
crosstalk proportionally reduced; so a more probable 1 kΩ source gives 115 dB of intersource 
rejection at 10 kHz for the 4-changeover configuration. 
 The third input of  Figure 21.1b has a resistive attenuator intended to bring CD outputs down 
to the same level as other sources. In this case inter-source crosstalk can be improved simply 
by back-grounding the attenuator output when it is not in use, so only a 2-pole switch is 
required for good isolation of this input. 
 The Virtual Contact 
 What do you do if you need a changeover switch – to select one of two signal sources – but 
only have a make contact? Here is a technique that can be a lifesaver when you have screwed 
up on ordering a switch with a long leadtime, or if you live in a Dilbertian world of last-
minute spec changes. 
 Figure 21.2 demonstrates the principle. With the switch S open, source A goes through 
voltage-follower A and R feed to the output voltage-follower. With the switch closed, the 
much lower impedance output of voltage-follower B takes over and the contribution 
from A is now negligible. To give good rejection of A, the output impedance of follower 
B must be much, much lower than the value of R feed ; so an opamp output must be used 
directly.  Figure 21.3 shows how good the rejection of A can be using 5532 opamps as the 
voltage-followers.

 At first this technique looks a bit opamp-intensive. However, there is often no need to 
use dedicated voltage-followers if a similar low-impedance feed is available from a 
previous stage that uses an opamp with a large amount of negative feedback. Likewise, 
the output voltage-follower may often be dispensed with if the following load is 
reasonably high. 
 There is also the rejection of B when the switch is open to consider. The impedance of R feed 
mean there is the potential for capacitative crosstalk across the open switch contacts. The 
amount depends on the value of R feed and on switch construction. 
 If the offness of B is more important than the offness of A, then R feed should be a lower value, 
to minimise the effects of the capacitance. Do not make R feed  too low as A drives through it 
into effectively a short circuit when B is selected. 
 If the offness of A is more important, R feed should be higher to increase its ratio to the output 
impedance of B; be aware that making it too high may introduce excessive Johnson noise.

 The rejection of A shown in  Figure 21.3 worsens at high frequencies, as the dominant-pole 
of opamp B reduces its open-loop gain and the output impedance rises. The slopes are 6 dB/
octave as usual. 
 This technique is particularly useful for switching between three sources with a centre-off 
toggle switch. 
 Relay switching 
 Any electronic switching technique must face comparison with relays, which are still very 
much with us. Relays give total galvanic isolation between control and signal, zero contact 
distortion, and in audio terms have virtually unlimited signal-handling capability. They 
introduce negligible series resistance and shunt leakage to ground is usually also negligible. 
Signal offness can be very good, but as with other kinds of switching, this depends on 
intelligent usage. There will always be capacitance between open contacts, and if signal is 
allowed to crosstalk through this to nominally off circuitry, the ‘offness’ will be no better than 
other kinds of switching. 
 Obviously relays have their disadvantages. They are relatively big, expensive, and not always 
as reliable as more than a hundred years of development should have made them. Their 
operating power is significant, though it can be reduced by circuitry that applies full voltage 
to pull in the relay and then a lower voltage to keep it closed. Some kinds of power relay can 
introduce disastrous distortion if used for switching audio because the signal passes through 
the magnetic soft-iron frame; however, such problems are likely to be confined to the output 
circuits of large power amplifiers. For small-signal switching the linearity of relay contacts 
can normally be regarded as perfect. 
 Electronic switching 
 Electronic switching is usually implemented with CMOS analogue gates, of which the well-
known 4016 is the most common example, and these are examined first. However, there are 
many special applications where discrete JFETs provide a better solution, so these are dealt 
with in the second part. 
 Switching with CMOS analogue gates 
 CMOS analogue gates, also known as transmission gates, are quite different from the 
CMOS logic gates in the 4000 series, though the underlying process technology is the same. 
Analogue gates are bilateral, which means that either of the in/out leads can be the input 
or output; this is emphatically not true for logic gates. The ‘analogue’ part of the name 

578 Chapter 21
emphasises that they are not restricted to fixed logic levels, but pass whatever signal they 
are given with low distortion. The ‘low’ there requires a bit of qualification, as will be 
seen later. 
 When switched on, the connection between the two pins is a resistance which 
passes current in each direction as usual, depending on the voltage between the 
two terminals. Analogue gates have been around for a long time, and are in some 
ways the obvious method of electronic switching. They do however have significant 
drawbacks. 
 Analogue gates like the 4016 are made up of two MOSFETs of opposite polarity connected 
back to back. The internal structure of a 4016 analogue gate is shown in  Figure 21.4 . The 
two transmission FETs with their protective diodes are shown on the right; on the left is the 
control circuitry. A and B are standard CMOS inverters whose only function is to sharpen 
up the rather soggy voltage levels that 4000-series CMOS logic sometimes provides. The 
output of B directly controls one FET, and inverter C develops the anti-phase control 
voltage for the FET of opposite polarity, which requires an inverted gate voltage to turn it 
on or off. 
 MOSFETS are of the enhancement type, requiring a voltage to be applied to the gate to turn 
them on (in contrast JFETs work in depletion mode and require a gate voltage to turn them 
 off  ) so as the channel approaches the gate voltage, the device turns off more. An analogue 
gate with only one polarity of FET would be of little use because R on would become very 
high at one extreme of the voltage range. This is why complementary FETs are used; as one 
polarity finds its gate voltage decreasing, turning it off, the other polarity has its gate voltage 
increasing, turning it more on. It would be nice if this process cancelled out so the R on was 
constant, but sadly it just doesn't work that way.  Figure 21.5 shows how R on varies with input 
voltage, and the peaky curve gives a strong hint that something is turning on as something 
else turns off. 
 Figure 21.5 also shows that R on is lower and varies less when the higher supply voltage 
is used; since these are enhancement FETs the on-resistance decreases as the available 
 Figure 21.4 : The internal circuitry of a 4000-series analogue gate 

Signal switching 579
control voltage increases. If you want the best linearity then always use the maximum 
rated supply voltage. 
 Since R on is not very linear, the smaller its value the better. The 4016 R on is specified as 
115 Ω typical, 350 Ω max, over the range of input voltages and with a 15 V supply. The 4066 
is a version of the 4016 with lower R on , 60 Ω typical, 175 Ω max under the same conditions. 
This option can be very useful both in reducing distortion and improving offness, and in most 
cases there is no point in using the 4016. The performance figures given below all assume the 
use of the 4066 except where stated. 
 CMOS gates in voltage mode 
 Figure 21.6 shows the simplest and most obvious way of switching audio on and off with 
CMOS analogue gates. This series configuration is in a sense the ‘official’ way of using them; 
the only snag being that it doesn’t work very well.

 Figure 21.6 : Voltage-mode series switching circuit using analogue gate 

580 Chapter 21
 Figure 21.7 shows the measured distortion performance of the simple series gate using 
the 4016 type. The distortion performance is a long way from brilliant, exceeding 
0.1% just above 2 Vrms. These tests, like most in this section, display the results for 
a single sample of the semiconductor in question. Care has been taken to make these 
representative, but there will inevitably be some small variation in parameters like R on . 
This may be greater when comparing the theoretically identical products of different 
manufacturers. 
 Replacing the 4016 gate with a 4066 gives a reliable improvement due to the lower R on . THD 
at 2 Vrms (10 kΩ load) has dropped to a third of its previous level (see Figure 21.8). There 
seems to be no downside to using 4066 gates instead of the more common and better-known 
4016, and they are used exclusively from this point on, unless otherwise stated. Likewise, 
using multiple gates in parallel reduces distortion; see Figure 21.9.
 The distortion is fairly pure second harmonic, except at the highest signal levels where 
higher-order harmonics begin to intrude. This is shown in  Figures 21.8 and  21.9 by the 
straight line plots beginning to bend upwards above 2 Vrms. 
 Analogue gate distortion is flat with frequency as far as audio is concerned, so no plots of THD 
versus frequency are shown; they would just be a rather uninteresting set of horizontal lines. 
 This circuit gives poor offness when off, as shown by  Figure 21.10. The offness is limited by 
the stray capacitance in the package feeding through into the relatively high load impedance.

If this is 10 kΩ the offness is only 48 dB at 20 kHz, which would be quite inadequate for 
most applications. The load impedance could be reduced below 10 kΩ to improve offness – 
for example, 4k7 offers about a 7 dB improvement – but this degrades the distortion, which is 
already poor at 0.055% for 3 Vrms, to 0.10%. 
 Using 4066 gates instead of 4016s does not improve offness in this configuration. The 
internal capacitance that allows signals to leak past the gate seems to be the same for both 
types. The maximum signal level that can be passed through (or stopped) is limited by the 
CMOS supply rails and conduction of the protection diodes. While it would in some cases be 
possible to contrive a bootstrapped supply to remove this limitation, it is probably not a good 
route to head down. 
 Figure 21.11 shows a CMOS three-way switch. When analogue gates are used as a multi-
way switch, the offness problem is much reduced, because capacitative feedthrough of

the unwanted inputs is attenuated by the low R on looking back into the (hopefully) low 
impedance of the active input, such as an opamp output. If this is not the case then the 
crosstalk from nominally off inputs can be serious. 
 In this circuit the basic poor linearity is unchanged, but since the crosstalk problem is much 
less, there is often scope for increasing the load impedance to improve linearity. This makes 
R on a smaller proportion of the total resistance. The control voltages must be managed so 
that only one gate is on at a time, so there is no possibility of connecting two opamp outputs 
together. 
 It may appear that if you are implementing a true changeover switch, which always has one 
input on, the resistor to ground is redundant, and just a cause of distortion. Omitting it is 
however very risky, because if all CMOS gates are off together even for an instant, there is no 
DC path to the opamp input and it will register its displeasure by snapping its output to one of 
the rails. This does not sound nice. 
 Figure 21.12 shows the offness of a changeover system, for two types of FET-input opamps. 
The offness is much improved to 87 dB at 20 kHz, an improvement of 40 dB over the 
simple series switch; at the high-frequency end however it still degrades at the same rate of 
6 dB/octave. It is well-known that the output impedance of an opamp with negative feedback 
increases with frequency at this rate, as the amount of internal gain falls, and this effect is an 
immediate suspect. However, there is actually no detectable signal on the opamp output (as 
shown by the lowest trace) and is also not very likely that two completely different opamps 
would have exactly the same output impedance. I was prepared for a subtle effect, but the

true explanation is that the falling offness is simply due to feedthrough via the internal 
capacitance of the analogue gate. 
 It now remains to explain why the OPA2134 apparently gives better offness in the flat low-
frequency region. In fact it does not; the flat parts of the trace represent the noise floor for 
that particular opamp. The OPA2134 is a more sophisticated and quieter device than the 
TL072, and this is reflected in the lower noise floor. 
 There are two linearity problems. Firstly, the on-resistance itself is not totally linear. 
Secondly, and more serious, the on-resistance is modulated when the gates move up and 
down with respect to their fixed control voltages. 
 It will by now probably have occurred to most readers that an on/off switch with good offness 
can be made by making a changeover switch with one input grounded. This is quite true, 
but since much better distortion performance can be obtained by using the same approach in 
current mode, as explained below, I am not considering it further here. 
 Figure 21.13 shows a shunt muting circuit. This gives no distortion in the ON state because the 
signal is no longer going through the R on  of a gate. However the offness is limited by the R on , 
forming a potential divider with the series resistor R; the latter cannot be very high in value or the 
circuit noise will be degraded. There is however the advantage that the offness plot is completely 
flat with frequency. Note that the ON and OFF states of the control voltage are now inverted. 
 Table 21.2 gives the measured results for the circuit, using the 4066. The offness can be 
improved by putting two or more of these gates in parallel, but since doubling the number N 
only gives 6 dB improvement, it is rarely useful to press this approach beyond four gates.

 CMOS gates in current mode 
 Using these gates in current mode – usually by defining the current through the gate with an 
input resistor and dropping it into the virtual-earth input of a shunt-feedback amplifier – gives 
much superior linearity. It removes the modulation of channel resistance as the gate goes 
up and down with respect to its supply rails and, in its more sophisticated forms, can also 
remove the signal voltage limit and improve offness. 
 Figure 21.14 shows the simplest version of a current-mode on/off switch. An important 
design decision is the value of R in and R nfb , which are often equal to give unity gain. Too low 
a value increases the effect of the non-linear R on , while too high a value degrades offness, 
as it makes the gate stray capacitance more significant, and also increases Johnson noise. In 
most cases 22 KΩ is a good compromise. 
 Table 21.3 gives the distortion for 20 dBu (7.75 Vrms) in/out, and shows that it is now very 
low compared with voltage-mode switchers working at much lower signal levels; compare 
the table data with  Figures 21.8 and  21.9 above. The increase in THD at high frequencies is 
due to a contribution from the opamp. However, the offness is pretty poor, and would not be 
acceptable for most applications. The problem is that with the gate off, the full signal voltage 
appears at the gate input and crosstalks to the summing node through the package's internal 
capacitance. In practical double-sided PCB layouts the inter-track capacitance can usually be 
kept very low by suitable layout, but the internal capacitance of the gate is inescapable. 
 In  Figures 21.14  and  21.15 , the CMOS gate is powered from a maximum of ±7.5 V. This 
means that in  Figure 21.14  , signal breakthrough begins at an input of 5.1 Vrms. This is

much too low for opamps running off their normal rail voltages, and several dB of headroom 
are lost. 
 Figure 21.15 shows a partial cure for this. Resistor R in2 is added to attenuate the input signal 
when the CMOS gate is off, preventing breakthrough. There is no effect on signal gain when 
the gate is on, but the presence of R in2 does increase the noise gain of the stage. 
 As with all shunt-feedback stages, this circuit introduces a phase-inversion, which is 
sometimes convenient, but usually not. 
 CMOS series-shunt current mode 
 We now extravagantly use two 4016 CMOS gates, as shown in  Figure 21.16. 
 When the switch is on, the series gate passes the signal through as before; the shunt gate 
is off and has no effect. When the switch is off the series gate is off and the shunt gate 
is on, sending almost all the signal at A to ground so that the remaining voltage is very 
small. The exact value depends on the 4016 specimen and its R on  value, but is about 42 dB 
below the input voltage. This deals with the offness (by greatly reducing the signal that 
can crosstalk through the internal capacitance) and also increases the headroom by several 
dB, as there is now effectively no voltage signal to breakthrough when it exceeds the rails 
of the series gate. 
 Figure 21.15 : Current-mode switch circuit with breakthrough prevention resistor Rin2 
 Figure 21.16:  A series-shunt current-mode switch  

Signal switching 587
 Two antiphase control signals are now required. If you have a spare analogue gate it can 
generate the inverted control signal, as shown in  Figure 21.17. 
 The distortion generated by this circuit can be usefully reduced by using two gates in parallel 
for the series switching, as in  Table 21.4 ; this gate-doubling reduces the ratio of the variable 
R on to the fixed series resistor and so improves the linearity. Using two in parallel is sufficient 
to render the distortion negligible (the higher distortion figures at 10 kHz and 20 kHz are due 
to distortion generated by the TL072 opamp used in the measurements). 
 As before the input and output levels are 20 dBu, well above the nominal signal levels 
expected in opamp circuitry; measurements taken at more realistic levels would show 
only noise. 
 Discrete FETs have lower R on than analogue gates. If a J111 JFET is used as the shunt 
switching element the residual signal at A is further reduced, to about 60 dB below the 
input level, with a consequent improvement in offness, demonstrated by the bottom row 
in  Table 21.4. This could also be accomplished by using two or more CMOS gates for the 
shunt switching.

 Control voltage feedthrough in CMOS gates 
 When an analogue gate changes state, some energy from the control voltage passes into the 
audio path via the gate-channel capacitance of the switching FETs, through internal package 
capacitances, and through any stray capacitance designed into the PCB. Since the control 
voltages of analogue gates move snappily, due to the internal inverters, this typically puts a 
click rather than a thump into the audio. Attempts to slow down the control voltage going into 
the chip with RC networks are not likely to be successful for this reason. In any case, slowing 
down the control voltage change simply converts a click to a thump; the FET gates are moving 
through the same voltage range, and the feedthrough capacitance has not altered, so the same 
amount of electric charge has been transferred to the audio path – it just gets there more slowly. 
 The only certain way to reduce the effect of transient feedthrough is to soak it up in a 
lower value of load resistor. The same electric charge is applied to a lower resistor value 
(the feedthrough capacitance is tiny, and controls the circuit impedance) so a lower voltage 
appears. Unfortunately reducing the load tends to increase the distortion, as we have already 
seen; the question is if this is acceptable in the intended application. 
 CMOS gates at higher voltages 
 Analogue gates of the 4016/4066 series have a voltage range of ±7.5 V, so they cannot 
directly switch signals from opamps running from the usual ±15 V or ±17 V rails. The classic 
device for solving this problem is the DG308 from Maxim. The absolute maximum supply 
rails are ±22 V, and the maximum signal range is specified as ±15 V. The R on is typically 
between 60 and 95 Ω with ±15 V supply rails, comparable with a 4016 on ±7.5 V rails. The 
DG308 is not pin-compatible with the 4016/4066.The DG308 has been around for a long 
time, and it has always been significantly more expensive than 4016/4066. That situation 
continues today. 
 CMOS gates at low voltages 
 So far we have generally assumed that the CMOS analogue gates will be run from the 
maximum rated rail voltages of ±7.5 V, to maximise the linearity of types such as the 
4016/4066. As noted in  Chapter 5 , there is nowadays much interest in designing audio paths 
that can give decent quality when run from 5 V, the power typically being drawn from a 
USB port or similar digital source; what I call Five Volt Fidelity. The 4016/4066 gates work 
poorly under these conditions; the supply voltage is reduced to a third of the maximum, and 
this gives very bad linearity. 
 The answer is to use something designed for the job. The DG9424 from Vishay-Siliconix is 
rated for maximum supplies of ±6 V, and works well running from a single 5 V supply. In this 
case its typical R on is 3.4 Ω, which is much superior to the range of R on shown for the 4016 

Signal switching 589
in  Figure 21.5. Once again a higher supply voltage means a lower R on and less distortion; 
running the DG9424 from ±5 V reduces the typical R on to 2 Ω, and using the maximum ±6 V 
rails reduces it further to typically 1.8 Ω. This is a considerable advance on the older parts. 
 Figure 21.18 shows the distortion in series mode at various signal levels when driving a 
10 kΩ load. When making the measurements I found that for outputs greater than 1.5 V and above 
32 kHz the analogue switches entered a high-distortion mode that gave about 0.06% THD. 
Whether that is a typical finding I am not sure, but it is unlikely to cause problems unless you 
are handling high-level ultrasonic signals. I also found that distortion was at a minimum for a 
single 8 V supply, which does not fit in well with the official R on specs; the reason for this 
is currently unknown. The DG9424 is pin-compatible with the DG308. 
 CMOS gate costs 
 Table 21.5 shows the prices for SMD format in small quantities at June 2013. The prices 
will obviously be much lower for quantity production, but the ratios between them should be 
roughly the same.

 You can see that the DG308 is a good deal more costly than the humbler 4016. The DG9424, 
being something of a specialised part, is more expensive again. The surprise is that the 4016 
comes out as more than twice as costly as the 4066. The only explanation I can think of is 
that, as mentioned earlier, the 4066 always works better and there seems no reason why the 
4016 should ever be used. Perhaps that means they are manufactured in smaller quantities 
and are therefore pricier. 
 Discrete JFET switching 
 Having looked in detail at analogue switching using CMOS gates, and having seen how well 
they can be made to work, you might be puzzled as to why anyone should wish to perform 
the same function with discrete JFETs. There are at least two advantages in particular 
applications. 
 Firstly, JFETs can handle the full output range of opamps working from maximum supply 
rails, so higher signal levels can often be switched directly without requiring opamps to 
convert between current and voltage mode. 
 Secondly, the direct access to the device gate allows relatively slow changes in attenuation 
(though still measured in milliseconds, for reasons that will emerge) rather than the rapid 
on-off action which CMOS gates give as a result of their internal control-voltage circuitry. 
This is vital in creating mute circuits that essentially implement a fast fade rather than a 
sharp cut, and so do not generate clicks and thumps by abruptly interrupting the signal. The 
downside is that they require carefully-tailored voltages to drive the gates, and these cannot 
always be conveniently derived from the usual opamp supply rails. 
 The series JFET switch in voltage mode 
 The basic JFET series switching circuit is shown in  Figure 21.19. With the switch open 
there is no other connection to the gate other than the bootstrap resistor R boot , V gs is zero, 
and so the FET is on. When the switch is closed, the gate is pulled down to a sufficiently 
negative voltage to ensure that the FET is biased off even when the input signal is at its 
negative limit.

 The JFET types J111 and J112 are specially designed for analogue switching and pre-eminent 
for this application. The channel on-resistances are low and relatively linear. This is a depletion-
mode FET, which requires a negative gate voltage to actively turn it off. The J111 requires a more 
negative V gs to ensure it is off, but in return gives a lower R ds(on) which means lower distortion. 
 The J111, J112 (and J113) are members of the same family – in fact they are the device, 
selected for gate/channel characteristics, unless I am much mistaken.  Table 21.6 shows how 
the J111 may need 10 V to turn it off, but gives a 30 Ω on-resistance or R ds(on) with zero gate 
voltage. In contrast the J112 needs only 5.0 V at most to turn it off, but has a higher R ds(on) of 
50 Ω. The trade-off is between ease of generating the gate control voltages, and linearity. The 
higher the R ds(on) , the higher the distortion, as this is a non-linear resistance. 
 FET tolerances are notoriously wide, and nothing varies more than the V gs characteristic. It is 
essential to take the full range into account when designing the control circuitry. 
 Both the J111 and J112 are widely used for audio switching. The J111 has the advantage of 
the lowest distortion, but the J112 can be driven directly from 4000 series logic running from 
±7.5 V rails, which is often convenient. The J113 appears to have no advantage to set against 
its high R ds(on) and is rarely used – I have never even seen one. 
 The circuits below use either J111 or J112, as appropriate. The typical version used is shown, 
along with typical values for associated components. 
 Figure 21.19 has Source and Drain marked on the JFET. In fact the J111 devices appear to be 
perfectly symmetrical, and it seems to make no difference which way round they are connected, 
so further diagrams omit this. As JFETs, in practical use they are not particularly static-sensitive.

 The off voltage must be sufficiently negative to ensure that V gs never becomes low enough to 
turn the JFET on. Since a J111 may require a V gs of 10 V to turn it off, the off voltage must 
be 10 V below the negative saturation point of the driving opamp – hence the 23 V rail. 
This is not exactly a convenient voltage, but the rail does not need to supply much current and 
the extra cost in something like a mixing console is relatively small. 
 To turn a JFET on, the V gs must be held at zero volts. That sounds simple enough, but it is 
actually the more difficult of the two states. Since the source is moving up and down with the 
signal, the gate must move up and down in exactly the same way to keep V gs at zero. This is 
done by bootstrap resistor R boot in  Figure 21.19. When the JFET is off, DC flows through this 
resistor from the source; it is therefore essential that this path be DC-coupled and fed from 
a low impedance such as an opamp output, as shown in these diagrams. The relatively small 
DC current drawn from the opamp causes no problems. 
 Figure 21.20 is a more practical circuit using a driver transistor to control the JFET (if you had 
a switch contact handy, you would presumably use it to control the audio directly). The pull-up 
resistor R c keeps diode D reverse-biased when the JFET is on; this is its sole function, so the 
value is not critical. It is usually high to reduce power consumption. I have used anything 
between 47 kΩ and 680 kΩ with success. 
 Sometimes DC-blocking is necessary if the opamp output is not at a DC level of 0 V. In 
this case the circuit of  Figure 21.21 is very useful; the audio path is DC-blocked but not the 
bootstrap resistor, which must always have a DC path to the opamp output. R drain keeps the 
capacitor voltage at zero when the JFET is held off. 
 Figure 21.22 shows the distortion performance with a load of 10 kΩ. The lower curve is the 
distortion from the 5532 opamp alone. The signal level was 7.75 Vrms (20 dBu). 
 Figure 21.23 shows the distortion performance with various heavier loadings, from 10 kΩ 
down to 1 kΩ. As is usual in the world of electronics, heavier loading makes things worse. In 
this case, it is because the non-linear R on becomes a more significant part of the total circuit 
resistance. The signal level was 7.75 Vrms (20 dBu).

 Figure 21.24 shows the distortion performance with different values of bootstrap resistor. The 
lower the value, the more accurately the drain follows the source at high audio frequencies, 
and so the lower the distortion. The signal level was 7.75 Vrms (20 dBu) once again. There 
appears to be no disadvantage to using a bootstrap resistor of 22 kΩ or so, except in special 
circumstances, as explained below. 
 Two series JFET switches can be simply combined to make a changeover switch, as shown 
in  Figure 21.25. The valid states are A on, B on, or both off. Both on is not a good option 
because the two opamps will then be driving each other’s outputs through the JFETs.

 It is possible to cascade FET switches, as in  Figure 21.26 , which is taken from a real mixing 
console application. Here the main output is switched between A and B as before, but a 
second auxiliary output is switched between this selection and another input C by JFET3 
and JFET4. The current drawn by the second bootstrap resistor R boot2 must flow through the 
R ds(on) of the first FET, and will thus generate a small click. R boot2 is therefore made as high 
as possible to minimise this effect, accepting that the distortion performance of the JFET3 
switch will be compromised at HF; this was acceptable in the application as the second 
output was not a major signal path. The bootstrap resistor of JFET4 can be the desirable 
lower value as this path is driven direct from an opamp. 
 The shunt JFET switch in voltage mode 
 The basic JFET shunt switching circuit is shown in  Figure 21.27. Like the shunt analogue 
gate mute, it gives poor offness but good linearity in the ON state, so long as its gate voltage 
is controlled so it never allows the JFET to begin conducting. Its great advantage is that the 
depletion JFET will be in its low-resistance state before and during circuit power-up, and can 
be used to mute switch-on transients. Switch-off transients can also be effectively muted if 
the drive circuitry is configured to turn on the shunt FETs as soon as the mains disappears, 
and keep them on until the various supply rails have completely collapsed. 
 I have used the circuit of  Figure 21.27 to mute the turn-on and turn-off transients of a hifi 
preamplifier. Since this is an output that is likely to drive a reasonable length of cable, with 
its attendant capacitance, it is important to keep R1 as low as possible, to minimise the 
 Figure 21.26 : Cascaded FET switches 

596 Chapter 21
possibility of a drooping treble response. This means that the R ds(on) of the JFET puts a limit 
on the offness possible. The output series resistor R1 is normally in the range 47–100 Ohms, 
when it has as its only job the isolation of the output opamp from cable capacitance. Here 
it has a value of 1K, which is a distinct compromise – it is not suited for use with very long 
cables. Even with this value the muting obtained was not quite adequate at 27 dB so two 
J111s were used in parallel, giving a further 6 dB of attenuation. The resulting 33 dB 
across the audio band was sufficient to render the transients inaudible. The offness is not 
frequency dependent as the impedances are low and so stray capacitance is irrelevant. 
 JFETS in current mode 
 JFETS can be used in the current mode, just as for analogue gates.  Figure 21.28 shows the 
basic muting circuit, with series FET switching only. R in2 attenuates the signal seen by the 
FET when it is off, to prevent breakthrough; its presence means that the gain of the circuit 
is somewhat less than unity with the values shown, but the gain may be readily adjusted by 
 Figure 21.27 : The basic JFET shunt switching circuit. Adding more JFETs in parallel increases the 
offness, but each 6 dB requires doubling their number

Signal switching 597
altering the value of R nfb .  Figure 21.29 illustrates the distortion performance and  Figure 21.30 
the offness of this circuit. Neither is startlingly good. 
 In designing a mute block, we want low distortion  and good offness at the same time, so 
the series-shunt configuration, which proved highly effective with CMOS analogue gates, is 
the obvious choice. The basic circuit is shown in  Figure 21.31 , the distortion performance is 
illustrated in  Figure 21.32 , and the offness in  Figures 21.33 and  21.34. Capacitor C1 across 
the feedback resistor is usually required to ensure HF stability, due to the FET capacitances 
hanging on the summing node at D. 
 Due to the shunt-feedback configuration, this circuit introduces a phase-inversion. I have 
often been forced to follow this circuit with another inverting stage that does nothing except 
get the phase right again. In this situation, it is sometimes advantageous to put the inverting

stage  before the mute block, so that any crosstalk to its sensitive summing node is muted with 
the signal by the following mute block. 
 The control voltages to the series and shunt JFETs are complementary as with the CMOS 
version, but now they can be slowed down by RC networks to make the operation gradual, 
as shown in  Figure 21.35 below. The exact way in which the control voltages overlap is 
easy to control, but the V gs /resistance law of the FET is not (and it is about the most variable 
FET parameter there is) and so the overlap of FET conduction is rather variable. However, 
I should say at once that this system does work, and works well enough to go in top-notch 
mixing consoles. As you go into the muted condition the series JFET turns off and the 
shunt JFET turns on, and if the overlap gets to be too much in error, the following bad 
things can happen: 
1.  If the shunt FET turns on too early, while the series JFET is still mostly on, a low-
resistance path is established from the opamp VE point to ground, causing a large but 
brief rise in stage noise gain. This produces a ‘chuff’ of noise at the output as muting 
occurs. 
2.  If the shunt FET turns on too late, so the series JFET is mostly off, the large signal 
voltage presented to the series FET causes visibly serious distortion. I say ‘visibly’ 
because it is well-known that even quite severe distortion is not obtrusive if it occurs 
only briefly. The transition here is usually fast enough for this to be the case; it would not 
however be a practical way to generate a slow fade. The conclusion is that we should err 
on the side of distortion rather than noise. 
 Reducing distortion by biasing 
 The distortion generated by this circuit block is of considerable importance, because if the rest 
of the audio path is made up of 5532 opamps – which is likely in professional equipment – then 
this stage can generate more distortion than the rest of the signal path combined, and dominate 
this aspect of the performance. It is therefore worth examining any way of increasing the 
linearity that we can think of. 
 Figure 21.31 : Series-shunt mode mute bloc circuit 

Signal switching 599
 We have already noted that to minimise distortion, the series JFET should be turned on as 
fully as possible to minimise the value of the non-linear R ds(on) . When a JFET has a zero gate-
source voltage, it is normally considered fully on. It is, however, possible to turn it even more 
on than this. 
 The technique is to put a small positive voltage on the gate, say about 200–300 mV. This further 
reduces the R ds(on)  in a smoothly continuous manner, without forward biasing the JFET gate 
junction and injecting DC into the signal path. This is accomplished in  Figure 21.35 by the 
simple addition of R p , which allows a small positive voltage to be set up across the 680K resistor 
R1. The value of R p is usually in the 10–22 MΩ range, for the circuit values shown here. 
 Care is needed with this technique, because if temperatures rise the JFET gate diode may 
begin to conduct after all and DC will leak into the signal path, causing thumps and bangs. In 
my experience 300 mV is about the upper safe limit for equipment that gets reasonably warm 
internally, i.e. about 50 °C. Caution is the watchword here, for unwanted transients are much 
less tolerable than slightly increased distortion. 
 As with analogue CMOS gates, an important consideration with this circuit is the impedance 
at which it works, i.e. the values of R in and R nfb . These are usually of equal resistance for 
unity gain so we will call their value R: 
1.  Raising R reduces distortion because it minimises the effect of R ds(on)  variation in the 
series JFET. 
2.  Lowering R reduces the noise generated by the circuit, and improves offness as it reduces 
the effect of stray capacitances. It also reduces the effect of control-voltage feedthrough 
via the gate-channel capacitances.

 Figures 21.33 and  21.34 examine how the offness of the circuit is affected by using values 
of 4k7 and 22 kΩ. The latter gives 110 dB rather than 120 dB at 10 kHz. In my not 
inconsiderable experience with this circuit, R  4k7 is the best choice when J112s are used. 
Values below 4k7 are not usual as distortion will increase as the JFET R ds(on)  becomes a larger 
part of the total resistance in the circuit. The loading effect of R in on the previous stage must 
also be considered. 
 JFET drive circuitry 
 The series-shunt mute bloc requires two complementary drive voltages, and these are most 
easily generated by 4000-series CMOS running from ±7.5 V rails. NAND gates are shown 
here as they are convenient for interfacing with other bits of control logic, but any standard 
CMOS output can be used. It is vital that the JFET gates get as close to 0 V as possible,

ensuring that the series gate can be fully on and give minimum distortion, so the best 
technique is to run the logic from these ± rails and use diodes to clamp the gates to 0 V. 
 Thus, in  Figure 21.35 , when the mute bloc is passing signal, the signal from gate A is high, 
so D1 is reverse-biased and the series JFET TR1 gate is held at 0 V by R1, keeping it on (the 
role of R p will be explained in a moment). Meanwhile, D2 is conducting as the NAND-gate 
output driving it is low, so the shunt JFET TR2 gate is at about 7 V and it is firmly switched 
off. This voltage is more than enough to turn off a J112, but cannot be guaranteed to turn off 
a J111, which may require 10 V (see  Table 21.6 above). This is one reason why the J112 is 
more often used in this application – it is simpler to generate the control voltages. When the 
mute bloc is off, the conditions are reversed, with the output of A low, turning off TR1, and 
the output of B high, turning on TR2. 
 When switching audio signals, a instantaneous cut of the signal is sometimes not what 
is required. When a non-zero audio signal is abruptly interrupted there is bound to be a 
click. Perhaps surprisingly, clever schemes for making the instant of switching coincide 
with a zero-crossing give little improvement. There may no longer be a step-change 
in level, but there is still a step-change in slope and the ear once more interprets this 
discontinuity as a click. 
 What is really needed is a fast-fade over about 10 msec. This is long enough to prevent clicks, 
without being so slow that the timing of the event becomes sloppy. This is normally only an 
issue in mixing consoles, where it is necessary for things to happen in real time. Such fast-
fade circuits are often called ‘mute blocks’ to emphasise that they are more than just simple 
on-off switches. Analogue gates cannot be slowly turned on and off due to their internal 
circuitry for control-voltage generation, so discrete JFETs must be used. Custom chips to 
perform the muting function have been produced, but the ones I have evaluated have been 
 Figure 21.35 : Circuitry to generate drive voltages for series-shunt JFET mute bloc  

602 Chapter 21
expensive, single-source, and give less than startling results for linearity and offness; this 
situation is of course subject to change. 
 In  Figure 21.35 the rate of control-voltage is determined by the RC networks at the NAND 
gate outputs. Ingenious schemes involving diodes to make the up/down rates different have 
been tried many times but my general conclusion is that they give little, if any, benefit. 
 Physical layout and offness 
 The offness of this circuit is extremely good, providing certain precautions are taken in the 
physical layout. In  Figure 21.36 there are two possible crosstalk paths that can damage the 
offness. The path C–D, through the internal capacitances of the series JFET, is rendered 
innocuous as C is connected firmly to ground by the shunt JFET. However, point A is still 
alive with full amplitude signal, and it is the stray capacitance from A to D that defines the 
offness at high frequencies. 
 Given the finite size of R in , it is often necessary to extend the PCB track B–C to get A far 
enough from D. This is no problem if done with caution. Remember that the track B–C is at 
virtual earth when the mute bloc is on, and so vulnerable to capacitative crosstalk from other 
signals straying into the area. 
 Dealing with the DC conditions 
 The circuits shown so far have been stripped down to their bare essentials to get the basic 
principles across. In reality, things are (surprise) a little more complicated. Opamps have 
non-zero offset and bias voltages and currents, and if not handled properly these will lead to 
thumps and bangs. There are several issues: 
1.  If there is any DC voltage at all passed on from the previous stage, this will be interrupted 
along with the signal, causing a click or thump. The foolproof answer is of course a 
DC-blocking capacitor, but if you are aiming to remove all capacitors from the signal 
 Figure 21.36 : Circuit of JFET mute showing stray capacitances and DC handling  

Signal switching 603
path, you may have a problem. DC servos can partly make up the lack, but since they 
are based on opamp integrators they are no more accurate than the opamp, while DC 
blocking is foolproof. 
2.  The offset voltage of the mute bloc opamp. If the noise gain is changed when the mute 
operates (which it is) the changing amplification of this offset will change the DC level 
at the output. The answer is shown in  Figure 21.36. The shunt FET is connected to 
ground via a blocking capacitor to prevent gain changes. This capacitor does not count 
as ‘being in the signal path’ as audio only goes through it when the circuit is muted. 
Feedback of the opamp offset voltage to this capacitor via the 47 kΩ resistor renders it 
innocuous. 
3.  The input bias and offset currents of the opamp. These are much more of a problem and 
are best dealt with by using JFET opamps such as TL072 or OPA2134, where the bias 
and offset currents are negligible at normal equipment temperatures. All of the distortion 
measurements in this chapter were made with TL072 opamps in place. 
 A soft changeover circuit 
 This circuit ( Figure 21.37 ) is designed to give a soft changeover between two inputs – in 
effect a fast crossfade. It is the same mute bloc but with two separate inputs, either or 
both of which can be switched on. The performance at 20 dBu in/out is summarised in 
 Table 21.7. 
 Figure 21.37 : Circuit of JFET soft changeover switching 

604 Chapter 21
 The THD increase at 20 kHz is due to the use of a TL072 as the opamp. J112 JFETs are used 
in all positions. 
 This circuit is intended for soft-switching applications where the transition between states is 
fast enough for a burst of increased distortion to go unnoticed. It is not suitable for generating 
slow crossfades in applications like disco mixers, as the exact crossfade law is not very 
predictable. 
 Control voltage feedthrough in JFETS 
 All discrete FETs have a small capacitance between the gate and the device channel, so 
changes in the gate voltage will therefore cause a charge to be transferred to the audio path, 
just as for CMOS analogue gates. As before, slowing down the control voltage change tends 
to give a thump rather than a click; the same amount of electric charge has been transferred 
to the audio path, but more slowly. Lowering the circuit impedance reduces the effects of 
feedthrough, but halving it only reduces the amplitude of transients by 6 dB, and such a 
reduction is likely to increase distortion.

 Mixer sub-systems 
 Introduction 
 This chapter deals with the specialised circuit blocks that make up mixing console. Some 
functions, such as microphone amplification, line input and output, and equalisation have 
already been explored in previous chapters. The other useful blocks are presented in the order 
that a signal encounters them as it goes through the console, but many of them are applicable 
to all the various kinds of module – input channels, groups, and master sections. For example, 
fader post-amplifiers and insert points will be found in all three types of module. 
 Mixer bus systems 
 In all but the smallest mixers there is a need to connect together all the modules so they have 
access to the mixing buses, power supply rails, and logic and control lines. 
 There are three basic ways of connecting the modules together. The smallest mixers are 
usually constructed on a single large PCB lying parallel to a one-piece front panel, and here 
‘modules’ means repeated circuitry rather than physical modules. The all-embracing PCB 
minimises the money spent on connectors, and the time plugging them in during assembly, 
but there are obvious limitations to the size of mixer you can build in this way. A definite 
problem is the need to run summing buses laterally, as this results in them winding their way 
between controls and circuit blocks, threatening a mediocre crosstalk performance. The use 
of double-sided PCBs helps greatly with this, but very often there are still awkward points 
such as the need for the feed to and from the faders to cross over the mix bus area. This 
can easily wreck the crosstalk performance; one solution is to use what I call a ‘three-layer 
board’. The mix buses are on the bottom of the PCB, the top layer above it carries a section 
of ground plane, and the fader connections are made by wire links above that. Given a tough 
solder-resist, no further insulation of the links is necessary; if you have doubts, then laying a 
rectangle of component-ident screen print under the links will give another layer of insulation 
without adding labour cost. 
 Medium-sized mixers are commonly made with separate modules, connected together with 
ribbon cable bearing insulation-displacement connectors. The advent of IDC ribbon cables 

606 Chapter 22
(a long time ago, now) had a major effect on the affordability of mixing consoles. These cables 
naturally join Pin 1 to Pin 1 on every module, and so on, leading to a certain inflexibility in 
design. 
 Large mixers use a motherboard system, where each module plugs into a PCB at the bottom 
of the frame, which is typically divided into ‘bins’ holding eight or 12 modules. This 
provides (at considerably increased expense) total flexibility in the running of buses and the 
interconnection of modules. 
 To me, it is a ‘mixing bus’ or a ‘summing bus’. I realise that some of the world spells it ‘buss’ 
and I am probably wasting my time pointing out that the latter is wrong but I am still going to 
do it. The term dates from the dawn of electrical distribution, when circuits were connected 
together by copper bars called ‘omnibus bars’. This inevitably got shortened to ‘bus-bars’ and 
in mixing consoles it was further abbreviated to ‘bus’ which somehow turned into ‘buss’. The 
Oxford English Dictionary says buss means ‘to kiss’ ( archaic ) which seems somehow not 
quite appropriate. Unless of course you’re recording Kiss. I have grave doubts if my protest here 
will make any difference to common usage, but sometimes you’ve just got to make a stand. 
 Input arrangements 
 Most mixer channels have both microphone and line inputs. On the lower-cost consoles 
these are usually switched to a single amplifier with a wide gain range, the line input being 
attenuated to a suitable level first. This approach is covered in  Chapter 17 on microphone 
amplifiers. High-end consoles have separate line input amplifiers, removing some 
compromises on CMRR and noise performance. Dedicated line input amplifiers are dealt 
with in  Chapter 18 . 
 Equalisation 
 Mixer input channels have more or less sophisticated tone controls to modify the frequency 
response, either to correct imperfections or produce specific effects. This subject is fully dealt 
with in  Chapter 15 . 
 Insert points 
 The addition of effects for general use, such as reverberation, is normally handled by an 
effects send system. However, if a specific effect (say, flanging) is going to be used on one 
channel only then it is far more efficient and convenient to connect the external effects unit 
in series with the signal path of the channel itself. This is done by means of an insert point 
(usually just called an ‘insert’) which is a jack with normalling contacts arranged so that the 

Mixer sub-systems 607
signal flows to it and back to the channel again when nothing is plugged in. When a jack is 
inserted the normalling connection is broken and the signal flows through the external unit. 
 Inserts are also often fitted to groups. Inserts come in two versions, illustrated in  Figure 22.1 . 
The single jack version is economical in panel space but is restricted to unbalanced operation. 
The two-jack version is superior because it allows the use of balanced send and returns, and 
in addition the OUT jack socket can be used as a direct output because inserting a jack in it 
does not break the signal path; only inserting a jack into the IN jack socket does that. 
 When the mixer has a patchbay, the insert sends (and indeed, other console outputs) are 
likely to find their way there through a quite considerable length of ribbon cable, which has 
significant capacitance between its conductors. It is easy to get into a situation where the 
crosstalk performance of the console is limited by capacitive crosstalk between outputs, 
despite their low impedance. Output amplifiers commonly have a series resistor to isolate the 
amplifier from the capacitance of the cabling and prevent HF instability, and the minimum 
safe value of this resistor defines the output impedance, which is usually in the region of 47 
to 100 Ω. Things get worse when the layers of ribbon cable are laid together in a ‘lasagne’ 
format; this is very often necessary because of the sheer number of signals going to and from 
the patchbay. In some cases layers of grounded screening foil are interleaved with the cables, 
but this is rather expensive and awkward to do, and does not greatly reduce crosstalk between 
conductors in the same piece of ribbon. The only way to do this is to reduce the output 
impedance. 
 In a particular mixer design project, the crosstalk between the insert sends from the channels, 
with an output impedance of 75 Ω, was found to be 96 dB at 10 kHz. This may not sound 
like a lot, but I didn’t get where I am today by designing consoles with measurable crosstalk, 
Figure 22.1: a) The single-jack insert and b) the two-jack insert 

608 Chapter 22
so something had to be done. An effective way to obtain a near-zero output impedance is 
shown in  Figure 22.2 . Here the main negative feedback for the opamp goes through R1, 
from the outside end of isolating resistor R2 and so reduces the output impedance, while the 
stabilising HF feedback is taken through C1 from the inside end, where it is not subject to 
phase-shift because of load capacitance. With this insert send stage the output impedance 
was reduced from 75 Ω to less than 1 Ω and the crosstalk disappeared below the noise floor. 
Very similar circuitry can be used with stages that have gain. Arrangements like this must 
always be carefully checked to make sure that HF stability with a capacitive load really  is 
maintained; this circuit is stable when driving a 22 nF load, which represents 220 metres of 
100 pF/metre cable. 
 This arrangement is sometimes called a ‘zero-impedance’ output; the impedance is certainly 
much lower than usual but it is not, of course, actually zero. 
 In a group module, an inverting insert send amplifier is often used to correct the phase 
inversion introduced by the summing amplifier. A zero-impedance version of this is 
illustrated in the section below on summing amplifiers. 
 How to move a circuit block 
 In the more sophisticated and versatile mixers it is often possible to rearrange the order of 
blocks in the signal path. A typical example is the facility to move an insert point from before 
to after the EQ section, depending on what sort of external processing is being plugged into 
the insert. Dynamics sections are also often movable to pre or post the EQ. 
 Figure 22.3 shows two ways to move a circuit block from one position to another in the 
signal path. The version at  Figure 22.3 a uses all the sections of a four-changeover switch to 
do the job. Normally the insert is before the EQ section, but when the switch (which would 
probably be labelled ‘insert post’ or whatever abbreviation of that which can be fitted in) is 
pressed the signal passes along path A and reaches the EQ first; it then goes back through 
Figure 22.2: A typical non-inverting insert-send ampliﬁ er with ‘zero-impedance’ output

Mixer sub-systems 609
path B, through the insert, and then to the output along path C. However, the existence of two 
unused switch contacts gives us a broad hint that there may be a more efficient way to do it. 
 There certainly is; Figure 22.3b shows how to do it with only three changeovers. When the 
switch is pressed the signal passes along path A and reaches the EQ first, goes back through 
path B, to the insert, and then out via path C. You might think that this economy is quite 
pointless because either way you will need to use a physical four-changeover switch, but in 
fact the spare switch section in Figure 22.3b comes in very handy indeed to operate a switch 
status indicator LED. Alternatively the spare switch section can be connected in parallel with 
one of the other sections in the hope of improving reliability, but . . . 
 Paralleling switch sections is not actually as useful for enhancing reliability as you might 
think. The classic switch problem is contamination of silver-plated contacts; the silver 
is converted to non-conductive silver sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide in the 
atmosphere. This can come from industrial pollution, but another source is diesel engine 
exhaust so virtually nowhere can be assumed to be free of it. If one set of contacts in a switch

sections instead of four

610 Chapter 22
is affected then the other set right next to it is certain to be affected also, and paralleling the 
contacts is actually of little or no use. Sad but true. 
 Faders 
 So far as circuit design is concerned, a slide fader can normally be regarded as simply a 
logarithmic potentiometer, though in fact its internal construction may be quite complicated. 
The technology of faders is dealt with in  Chapter 13 on volume controls. 
 Postfade ampliﬁ ers 
 The postfade amplifier (sometimes called just the post amp) comes just after the fader, as its 
name implies. Its primary function is to allow the fader section to give gain. A 10 dB post 
amplifier, which is the most common amount of gain, allows the fader to be calibrated up to 
10 dB. The 0 dB setting is then some way down the scale and it is much easier to adjust 
the channel level up and down with respect to the rest of the mix. Without this feature, if a 
channel was fully faded up at 0 dB, to increase its relative level it would be necessary to pull 
all the other faders down. When you consider that a large mixer may have 64 channel faders 
you can see that this would be something of a nuisance. 
 The second function of the post amp is to buffer the fader from the heavy loading of the 
panpot, mix resistors and aux sends. The fader control law is carefully chosen for optimal 
controllability, and that law would be seriously distorted if all that loading came directly on 
the fader wiper. 
 It is important that the post amp has good noise performance, because its noise contribution 
is not much reduced when the fader is pulled down, and it must also have a good load-driving 
capability at low distortion. For these two reasons, the 5534/2 opamp found a home in post 
amps quite early in its history, when its high cost ruled it out for most other circuit functions, 
which were still handled by TL072s. The other place that 5534/2s appeared early was in 
summing amplifiers, which often work at a high noise gain. 
 However, in budget designs TL072s or equivalent FET-input opamps are still used because 
they are not only cheaper themselves but allow several other parts to be omitted. In Figure 22.4a, 
the opamp input can be directly connected to the fader wiper because the input bias current is 
negligible and does not cause significant noise when the wiper is moved along the track. Note 
that the gain-determining resistors R2, R3 have to be quite high to minimise the loading on 
the opamp output. C3 improves stability. 
 In a more sophisticated design as in Figure 22.4b, the use of a 5534 with its significant bias 
current means that DC blocking capacitor C1 is required to prevent unpleasant sounds when the 

Figure 22.4: Three versions of a postfade ampliﬁ er. That at a) is the cheap and cheerful version, 
b) is the more up-market version, with pre and post sends and the panpot section of a mixer 
channel shown, c) protects the opamp against capacitive loading while still giving a ‘zero-
impedance’ output

612 Chapter 22
fader is adjusted; in turn this means that R1 is required to bias the opamp. Another consequence 
flows from this: R1 has to have a relatively high value so it does not load the fader and distort 
its control law, and so the 5534 input bias current causes a relatively large offset voltage at the 
opamp input. The 5534 max bias current is 800 nA, which means a possible drop across R1 of 
37.6 mV. The 5534 has NPN input devices, so the bias current flows into the input pins, and 
so this voltage is negative, and that is why C1 is the way round it is. This input offset appears 
multiplied by three at the post amp output, giving 113 mV. This is not enough to significantly 
affect the available output swing, but it does mean that C2 must be introduced to keep DC out 
of the panpot and postfade sends. Since the loading is quite heavy, C2 must be large to prevent 
it creating distortion (see  Chapter 2 ). Note also the polarity of C2. We now have not only a more 
expensive opamp with a higher power consumption, but three extra components. Their number 
is multiplied by N, the number of channels, so you can see that the use of the 5534 as a post 
amp was actually a more serious cost decision than it might appear. 
 You will note that in  Figure 22.4 b the resistors R2, R3 in the feedback network have been 
reduced in value by a factor of about two to improve the noise performance. However, 
they are still not particularly low in value and it is true that the noise performance could be 
improved if they were reduced to, say, 680 Ω and 330 Ω, which in itself would be well within 
the drive capability of a 5532. However, in simpler desks this opamp has to drive not only its 
own feedback network, but also the panpot, routing matrix and the postfade sends, and most 
of its drive capability has to be reserved for this duty. 
 Figure 22.4c shows a post amp utilising the ‘zero-impedance’ approach described above for 
insert send amplifiers. In some layouts the panpot, routing and postfade sends are physically 
spread out so that the stray capacitance seen by the post amp output is enough to imperil its 
stability. An output isolating resistor R4 cures the problem but if simply stuck in the output 
line causes the level after it to vary as changing panpot and send settings alter the load on 
it. The feedback resistor R2 is therefore fed from after R4, preserving the ‘zero-impedance’ 
output, but C3 is fed from before it, maintaining the HF stability. 
 Fader post amps almost invariably have a fixed gain; if they did not the carefully-designed 
fader law would no longer be obtained. However, there are places where making the gain 
effectively variable by the use of positive feedback allows the post amp to have a low gain 
when its associated control is at a low setting; this minimises the noise contribution of the 
post amp. There is more on this technique in the section on aux masters. 
 Direct outputs 
 In more complex consoles, a direct out is available from each channel. This is a postfade signal, 
which can be fed directly to a recording device without sending it through the routing and 
summing systems. This gives a minimum signal path which will exhibit less noise and possibly 

Mixer sub-systems 613
less distortion. In all except the most elaborate consoles the direct out tends to be unbalanced, to 
save hardware, and reliance is placed on the recording device having balanced inputs. 
 Panpots 
 The word ‘panpot’ is short for ‘panoramic potentiometer’. It is the control that places a monaural 
source in the desired place in the left-right stereo scene. It is an extremely fortunate property of 
human hearing that this can be done effectively simply by altering the proportion of the mono 
signal that is sent to the left and right channels of the stereo output. Changing the perception of 
up and down is considerably more complicated, and outside the scope of mixer design. 
 The earliest attempt at ‘pan-potting’ dates back to before the use of electrical amplification. 
In 1903, the French engineer, Leon Gaumont, was granted patents for loudspeaker systems 
to go with his sound-on-gramophone-disc talking films. Gaumont was the first to suggest 
placing loudspeakers behind the screen, with men carrying them about to follow the images 
on the screen. This procedure has never found favour in the sound industry, especially 
amongst those who might be asked to do the carrying. 
 To give smooth stereo panning without unwanted level changes, the panpot should 
theoretically have a sine/cosine characteristic, as shown in  Figure 22.5 ; with this law, both 
Figure 22.5: Panpot laws. The ideal compromise between the sine and sine-squared laws is the 
arithmetical mean of the two, shown here

614 Chapter 22
signals are attenuated by 3 dB when the panpot is set centrally. This is because when listening 
to stereo over loudspeakers, the signals that sum at each ear are not correlated, and so with 
equal amplitude the two signals give a result that is only 3 dB above the level of each of the 
components. The summation of two uncorrelated white noise sources to give a combined 
signal that is 3 dB greater, and not 6 dB, works on exactly the same principle. The sine/cosine 
law is therefore appropriate for stereo. 
 However, when you are listening in mono, such as via AM radio, the left and right signals 
have been summed when they are still in the electrical domain, and therefore are in phase 
and sum together arithmetically. In this case, the pan law needs to be 6 dB down at the 
centre rather than 3 dB if level changes are to be avoided, so in this case a sine-squared/
cosine-squared law is required. Since it is highly desirable to cope with both cases, the 
standard answer is to use a compromise between the two laws. This is entirely satisfactory in 
practice, not least because moving a component of the mix around during the performance 
is completely inappropriate for most forms of music, and I have yet to hear a music reviewer 
complain of ‘bad panpotting’. 
 Figure 22.5 shows both the sine and sine-squared theoretical laws, and also the lines L, R which 
indicate the ideal compromise law; it is the arithmetical mean of sine and sine-squared and so is 
4.5 dB down with the panpot central. So – how do we obtain the compromise law we want? 
   Passive panpots 
 Figure 22.6 shows three different ways to make a panpot. Panpot circuits can be made 
with single pots with the wiper grounded, as shown in  Figure 22.6 a, but this has several 
disadvantages, not least the poor offness when panned hard over, caused by the current 
flowing through the wiper contact resistance to ground. 
 Potentiometers with an accurate sine/cosine law used to exist, which in theory allowed the 
use of the simple panpot circuit in Figure 22.6b but they were always bulky and prohibitively 
expensive for audio use, and seem to have disappeared altogether now that analogue 
computers are no longer at the cutting edge of technology. Hifi preamplifiers sometimes use 
a control with a ‘balance law’ for adjusting channel balance (see  Chapter 14 for more on that) 
but this usually has no attenuation at all at the centre point and would make a poor panpot. 
 The traditional answer to the problem has always been to use dual linear pots and bend 
the linear law into an approximation of the compromise law we want by the use of fixed 
pull-up resistors connected to the wipers, as shown in  Figure 22.6 c. Here the panpot wipers 
are loaded with mix resistors of 10 kΩ, which being connected to virtual-earth buses are 
connected to ground as far as the panpot is concerned, and the pull-up resistors R law are made 
3k9 to give the desired 4.5 dB of attenuation at the centre position of the panpot. 

Figure 22.6: Three ways to make a panpot; c) uses a linear pot with law-bending resistors and 
is the most popular

616 Chapter 22
 There is an important factor in the design of panpot circuitry, and here a significant 
difference between low-cost and high-cost mixers intrudes. A low-cost mixer will drive the 
routing resistors directly from the panpot wipers, as shown in  Figure 22.7 a, and the panpot 
law is affected by the loading to ground represented by the routing resistors; they work 
in opposition to the law-bending pull-up resistors, which therefore have to be reduced in 
value (here to 3k3) to get the mid-point attenuation back to 4.5 dB. As the wiper loading 
increases and the value of the pull-up resistors is decreased with respect to the panpot track, 
the more the resulting law tends to flatten out around the central position, as shown in  Figure 22.8 . 
 Table 22.1 shows how the law-bend resistors change with loading when a 10 kΩ pot is used, 
and the resulting pan laws can be seen in   Figures 22.8 and 22.9. 
 The distorted law that results from excessive loading gives a panpot that does little as it is 
moved through the central position, and has an unpleasant ‘dead’ feeling; there are also level

bending resistors have been adjusted to give 4.5 dB at the centre. See Table 22.1

618 Chapter 22
problems, as previously described. In addition, the lower the pull-up resistors, the greater 
loading they place on the stage upstream, which is usually the fader post amp; the loading is 
at its worst when the panpot is hard over to either side. This way of using a panpot presents a 
compromise on top of a compromise, and puts a limit on the number of mix resistors that can 
be driven directly from a panpot.  
 Figure 22.9 shows the differences between the ideal compromise law and the actual law that 
results from law bending, for various wiper loadings as in  Table 22.1 . The amplitude error 
of the right output gets enormous as the loading increases; when the panpot begins to move 
away from hard left the level shoots up much too quickly.  
 Since the value of the pull-up resistor required to get the best approach to the required law 
depends on the loading on the panpot wiper, this is a very good reason to use routing methods 
that place a constant load on the panpot, regardless of the number of buses that are being 
routed to, as this at least allows the value of the law-bending resistors to be optimised at one 
value. There is more on this later. 
 A more sophisticated approach is used in high-cost mixers, which puts unity-gain (or near-
unity gain) buffers between the panpot and the loading of the routing resistors, as shown 
in  Figure 22.7 b. Here there are two points to note: the panpot wipers now have a negligible 
loading to ground, and the pull-up resistors therefore have a much higher value of 10 kΩ, 
which will improve offness as less current goes through the wiper contact resistance. Also, 
the routing resistor values can be reduced, as they no longer load the panpot, and this reduces 
the Johnson noise generated in the summing system. 
 This law-bending technique is a workable solution, and has been very widely used, but 
unfortunately the addition of the law-bending resistor introduces another problem. A 
reasonable quality pot has an offness of about 90 dB with reference to fully up, due to 
the end-of-track resistance. The pull-up current from the law-bend resistors, however, 
passes through the wiper contact resistance, which is usually greater than the end-of-track 
resistance, and this extra resistance severely limits the attenuation the panpot can provide 
when set hard left or right, degrading the offness of the panpot from approximately 90 dB 
to 65 dB when it is hard over. The problem is made worse because when the wiper is 
at the bottom of the track, the whole of the signal voltage across the pot is also across 
the law-bend resistor, which is lower in resistance than the pot track and so passes more 
current through the wiper contact resistance. The exact value of offness obtained depends 
on the component values and the construction of the pot. The way this works is shown in 
 Figure 22.10 .  
 This reduction in offness is not really a problem in stereo use, as an attenuation of 65 dB 
is more than enough to pan a sound so it is subjectively completely to one side (in fact about 
20 dB will do that) but it is a very serious issue for mixers that route to groups in pairs, 

Mixer sub-systems 619
or, in other words, have one switch to route to Groups 1 and 2, another switch for Groups 3 
and 4, and so on. Simpler mixers route to groups in pairs, as this makes good use of two-
changeover switches (and, as mentioned before, the channels are by a long way the most 
cost-sensitive part of a mixer) but it means that if you are, say, routing to Group 1 by pressing 
the 1–2 switch and then panning hard left, then the signal being sent to Group 2 will only be 
65 dB down. In bigger and more expensive consoles each group has its own routing switch, 
with the spare switch section typically used for an indicator LED, so panpot offness is not 
such an important issue. 
 The active panpot 
 I think that it has made it clear that a conventional panpot is a bundle of compromises, and 
I decided in 1989 to do something about it. The active panpot was one of those ideas that 
strikes with such force that you remember exactly where and when it happened: in this case 
on the fifth floor of a tower block in Walthamstow.  
 The active panpot shown in  Figure 22.11 works by replacing the simple pull-up resistor 
with a negative-impedance-converter that modulates the law-bending effect in accordance 
with the panpot setting, making a closer approach to the sine law possible. This sounds 
intimidating but is actually very simple. The wiper of the left half of the panpot is connected 
 Figure 22.10 : How the law-bending resistors degrade the offness of a panpot 

620 Chapter 22
to a series-feedback amplifier U1:A that gives a modest gain of about 2 dB, set by R2 and R3; 
the exact value shown in  Figure 22.11 is 1.73 dB. The law-bending resistor R1 is driven from the 
output of this amplifier rather than the top of the panpot, and so, when the panpot wiper is at 
the lower end of its travel, there is little or no signal to the amplifier and therefore no pull-up 
action when it is not required. There is, therefore, no signal current flowing through the wiper 
contact resistance, so the left-right isolation using a good-quality pot is greatly improved from 
approx. 65 dB to 90 dB, being now limited solely by the end-of-track resistance as shown 
earlier in   Figure 22.10  a. As an extra benefit, if the amplifier gain and the law-bend resistor are 
correctly chosen, the pan law is much closer to the desired sin/sin 2 compromise law than can 
be obtained by the simple law-bending method described above; this is illustrated in Fig 22.12. 
This concept was protected by patent number  GB 2214372 in 1989.   
 The active panpot is obviously a more expensive solution, as we have added a dual opamp and 
four resistors to every channel. However, we get other benefits for our money as well as better 
pan offness and a better pan law; if the dual opamp is a 5532 (which it should be to keep the 
postfade noise down) then its good drive capability means that the value of the routing resistors 
can be reduced, which reduces both capacitive crosstalk and noise in the summing system.

gain of about 2 dB 

Mixer sub-systems 621
 LCR panpots 
 A relatively recent innovation in the world of panpots is the LCR panpot, where LCR 
stands for left-centre-right. This has three outputs; the left and right in general working 
the same way as for a normal panpot. As the panpot is moved from extreme left, the centre 
output rises from zero, reaches a maximum with the panpot central, and then falls to zero 
again as the panpot reaches extreme right. The LCR panpot is used with speaker systems 
that have a central cluster as well as left and right speaker banks. This means that centrally 
panned signals are always heard as in the centre of the sound field, regardless of listening 
position, and this is useful when vocals or speech are combined with music, as typically 
occurs in religious installations. It is also used for panning to a discrete centre channel to 
create surround and 5.1 mixes. A switch is normally provided by which the LCR pot can be 
converted to conventional L/R stereo operation. 
 There are two possible ways to handle LCR panning. In what I call the ‘full-width’ method, 
as shown in  Figure 22.13 , the left and right panpot outputs work much as they do in a normal 
stereo panpot, only falling to zero at the extreme end of control rotation.  
 The alternative is the ‘half-width’ method in which both left and right outputs fall to zero at 
the centre setting, and stay there for further control rotation; this is shown in  Figure 22.14 . 
 Figure 22.12 : The active panpot: the resulting law is much closer to the desired sin/sin2 
compromise. From Patent number GB 2 214 372 

 Figure 22.13 : A full-width LCR panpot law. Left and right cross over at 4.5 dB in the centre as 
before, while C is 0 dB at the centre, but zero at each extreme 
 Figure 22.14 : A half-width LCR panpot law. Left and right fall to zero at the centre setting and 
stay there for further control rotation. The crossover points between left and centre and right and 
centre are now at 4.5 dB 

Mixer sub-systems 623
Both Figures show laws which are a sin/sin 2  compromise as described earlier, and are 
therefore 4.5 dB down at the centre – in the case of the half-width method these ‘centres’ are 
at pot positions of 25% and 75% rotation. Which LCR panning method is most appropriate 
depends on the application; some LCR panpot systems can switch between the full-width and 
half-width modes.  
 Figure 22.15 shows a full-width LCR panpot arrangement. The L and R sections are as for 
a normal L–R panpot, but the C pot track is grounded at each end and fed with signal via its 
centre-tap; an LCR panpot always requires specially-designed pots with centre-taps on the 
tracks. These are available from major manufacturers like Alps but they are inevitably made 
in small quantities and are relatively expensive.  
 Figure 22.16 shows a half-width LCR panpot. The L and R sections are now also centre-
tapped (more expense!) and those taps are grounded so that the output falls to zero at the 
central control setting. The C pot track is grounded at both ends and fed with signal via its 
centre-tap as before.  
 LCR panpots, like ordinary panpots, give much superior performance in terms of offness and 
a better pan law when the active panpot system is applied to them. This is straightforward to 
do, and is arranged exactly as for the stereo version. 
 Consoles with LCR panning systems include the Soundcraft Series 5, the Yamaha M2500-56, 
the D&R Orion, and the Amek 9098i. True LCR panning is not common as it is a relatively 
high-cost facility.

 Routing systems 
 The routing system selects which mix bus the channel signal goes to. In a simple N into 
2 stereo mixer the panpot does all the routing that is required, but as soon as more groups are 
introduced some sort of switching is required for bus selection. 
 Figure 22.17 a shows the conventional routing system as commonly used up until about 
1980. There are two problems with this method. Firstly, the capacitance between the switch 
contacts when they are open is significant, and this severely limits the crosstalk performance 
of the console. To get a feel for the problem, look at  Figure 22.18 which shows the crosstalk 
performance of an ALPS SPUN two-changeover switch working into a mix bus with a 10 kΩ 
feedback resistor in the summing stage. This is a conventional push-switch with two parallel 
sections.  
 At 10 kHz the offness is only 66 dB, and at 20 kHz it is barely 60 dB. The problem is 
capacitive crosstalk across the switch contacts in the off position. Note that grounding the 
second switch section in the pious hope of improving things only reduces the crosstalk by 2 dB.  
 This problem can be completely eliminated by using the arrangement in  Figure 22.17 b, which 
is sometimes called the back-grounding system. The mix resistors are now connected to the 
channel ground when not in use and so there is no possibility of capacitive crosstalk – so long as 
the switches, of which one contact still carries signal voltage, are not too close to the mix buses. 
But this plan has a terrible drawback. The crosstalk performance is good, but back-grounding 
the mix resistors means that since relatively few routing switches are on at a time, most of the

resistors are grounded and the summing amp is working at or near maximum noise gain, and 
always picks up the maximum possible ground noise. 
 It might be wise to take a moment here to explain the noise gain of a summing system, 
though this material really belongs in the next section on summing systems. A simple 
inverting amplifier with equal input and feedback resistors has a noise gain of 2 times or 6 dB, 
 Figure 22.17 : Two mediocre routing systems with virtual-earth summing, as used in the 1970s: 
a) suffers from poor offness, b) has bad noise performance 

626 Chapter 22
because the noise referred to the amplifier input sees effectively a non-inverting amplifier 
with a gain of two, and so the noise at the output is twice that of the noise-generating 
mechanisms at the amplifier input. The important point is that the noise gain is greater than 
the signal gain, which is unity.  
 If a second mix resistor of equal value is connected to the summing point, the amplifier 
input now sees effectively a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of three, and the noise gain 
is increased to almost 10 dB, though the signal gain via either mix resistor remains unity. 
The more channels that are routed to a mix bus, the worse the noise performance is, as 
summarised in  Table 22.2. It is therefore clear that the arrangement in  Figure 22.17 b will be 
working at the worst-case noise gain all the time. Not only will the noise of the summing amp 
receive maximum amplification, but any ground noise in the console which puts the channel 
grounds at slightly different potentials will be picked up as effectively as possible. This is not 
a good plan, especially in large consoles. 
 Obviously a routing system that combined the advantages of the first two systems – good 
offness and minimum noise gain – would be a great improvement.  
 So, finally, here is the most satisfactory routing system. In the arrangement shown in 
 Figure 22.19 , the routing resistors are once more grounded when not being fed by the 
channel, but the topology has been turned around so that the grounded resistors are now 
connected to the channel rather than the mix bus. The switches rather than the routing

resistors are connected directly to the summing buses and, when a routing switch is not 
active, the feed from the routing resistor is grounded. So long as the hot end of the mix 
resistor can be kept away from the mix buses, the offness is truly excellent. With a bit of 
care in the physical construction, the offness can easily be better than 100 dB at 20 kHz. A 
possible objection is that all the grounded resistors put a heavier load on the channel circuitry

offness and optimal noise performance. Virtual-earth summing system also shown

upstream; this is quite true, but it has the countervailing advantage that since each mix 
resistor is either grounded directly or connected to a virtual–earth mix bus, the loading 
remains constant, and so if, for example, the resistors are driven from an unbuffered panpot, 
you will get a predictable panning law, if not necessarily a very good one. This routing 
method retains the advantage of working the summing system at the minimum noise gain. 
 I have a difficulty here. To the best of my knowledge I invented this system in the backroom 
of a shop in Leyton, London in 1979. I recall being nervous about the apparently iffy business 
of having the routing switch at virtual-earth, because of increased stray capacitance to ground 
from the virtual-earth bus, but in fact that caused no problems. However, since very little 
has been published about the details of mixer design, it being a proprietary art confined to a 
relatively small number of companies, it is not currently possible to say if I was the first to 
invent it. 
 The set of routing switches in each channel (often called the routing matrix) is relatively 
expensive and is, of course, multiplied by the number of channels. It is therefore common on 
all but the most expensive consoles for routing to be done in pairs; in other words, the first 
switch routes the channel to Groups 1 and 2, the second to Groups 3 and 4, and so on. This is 
simple to do as many varieties of push-switch come in a two-changeover format as standard. 
If routing to only one group is required then the signal has to be steered to the appropriate 
bus with the panpot. The offness of the panpot when set hard over is then crucial to obtaining 
good crosstalk figures; the active panpot scheme described above greatly improves this aspect 
of performance. 
 This system solves the electrical problems, but it relies on there being adequate physical 
separation between conductors carrying signal and the mix buses, to keep the capacitance 
between them low. This can present some interesting topological challenges. The obvious 
way to arrange the routing matrix is to put the switches next to the front panel, with the mix 
resistors behind them. Assuming we are using a double sided PCB, the tracks from the panpot 
to the mix resistors are on the other side of the board from the mix buses, but inevitably they 
have to cross over at some point, separated only by fibreglass. Back in the dark days when 
the cost penalty of double-sided PCBs was very serious, a single-sided PCB would be used 
with various convolutions of tracks and topside links used to get signals to the right places; 
this was inevitably a bundle of crosstalk compromises. Even a double-sided layout falls a 
long way short of perfection, as there is no screening between the panpot tracks and the mix 
bus tracks at the point where they cross. Keeping the track width to a minimum at this point 
reduces the capacitance between the tracks, but it remains the major limitation on crosstalk, 
i.e. ‘routing offness’. If the routing resistors are through-hole, the pads and component leads 
on the same PCB side as the mix buses will also contribute to unwanted coupling. 
 The solution to this problem, introduced by me in the Series 6000 in 1987 at Soundcraft, 
was to reduce the size of the routing resistors from ¼ W to ⅛ W, which made them small 

Mixer sub-systems 629
enough to fit between the actuators of the routing switches, right at the front edge of the 
PCB. This placed the mix resistors well away from the rear of the switches, which was the 
furthest extent of the mix buses, and likewise the panpot tracks could be run along the very 
front of the PCB. The use of a double-sided PCB allowed a ground plane to be placed on the 
other side of the mix buses. This form of construction was very successful, giving a major 
improvement in routing offness, and was later used in the famous 3200 console in 1988. 
Nowadays the mix resistors would probably be metal-film SMD, and could be fitted in very 
tight spaces at the front of the routing switches. 
 Auxiliary sends 
 These are straightforward. There is often a pre/post switch before the send pot so the send 
signal can be taken from before or after the fader. In many designs, added flexibility is given in 
the form of push-on links so that other take-off points for the send signal can be used, such as 
before the EQ section. Changing all these links on a large console is naturally not a light matter. 
 If there is an on/off switch for the send then it should disconnect the mix resistor from the 
bus, just as with the group routing switches described above. This reduces summing noise 
dramatically if only a few auxes are in use, and gives an offness much better than that at the 
end of the aux pot travel. 
 Group module circuit blocks 
 Most of the circuit blocks used in group modules carry out the same functions as they do in the 
input channel modules. The great exception is, of course, the summing amplifier, which has a 
technology all of its own. Before diving into the details of practical summing amplifiers, it is 
advantageous to look at the various methods of performing that apparently simple but actually 
rather demanding task – adding signals together. The most fundamental function of a mixer, as 
its name suggests, is to combine two or more signals in the desired proportion. As with many 
areas of electronics, an extremely simple definition of the job to be done (addition – how hard 
can that be?) rapidly shows itself to have ever-deeper levels of complexity. 
 There are several intriguing techniques to look at: 
 Voltage summing 
 Virtual-earth summing 
 Balanced summing 
 Ground-cancel summing 
 Distributed summing 

630 Chapter 22
 Summing systems: voltage summing 
 The earliest mixers used voltage summing, or passive summing as it is sometimes called, 
as shown in  Figure 22.20 ; note that only half of each panpot is shown, for clarity. The great 
drawback with this system is that there is a significant voltage on the mix buses, so that a signal 
can be fed onto the bus by one channel and it can get back into another channel, as shown in the 
figure, from where it may, depending on the control settings, find its way onto another mix bus 
where it is definitely not wanted. This is demonstrated by the arrow A in the diagram. Channel 1 
is feeding a signal onto Group 3 bus, and this is sidling back into Channel 2, which has both 
routing switches engaged and the panpot central, allowing the signal to turn round and get onto 
Group 1 bus. This sort of thing can, of course, be completely suppressed by suitable buffer 
stages after the panpot, and that is exactly what was done in the large consoles of the day. This 
means a lot of extra electronics, and this mixing system is not suitable for low or medium-cost 
designs. Another big snag is that since the mix buses have significant voltages on them, they 
must be carefully and expensively screened from each other to prevent capacitive crosstalk. 
Running the buses in a piece of low-cost ribbon cable is simply not an option. 
 Figure 22.20 : Voltage summing system as used in the 1960s 

Mixer sub-systems 631
 You will have noted that all the routing switches are back-grounded, so there is a constant 
impedance from the mix bus to ground; this is essential as otherwise the gain of the summing 
system would vary with the number of channels routed to a bus. This in turn means that the 
amplifiers that get the low level on the bus back up to the nominal internal level are working 
at substantial gain and are relatively noisy.  
 Summing systems: virtual-earth summing 
 Summing today is done almost universally by virtual-earth techniques, as shown above in 
 Figure 22.19 . An opamp or equivalent amplifier with shunt feedback is used to hold a long 
mixing bus at apparent ground, generating a sort of audio black hole; signals fed into this via 
mixing resistors apparently vanish, only to reappear at the output of the summing amplifier 
as they have been summed in the form of current. The great elegance of virtual-earth mixing, 
as opposed to the voltage-mode summing technique in  Figure 22.20 , is that signals cannot 
be fed back out of the bus to unwanted places as it is effectively grounded, and this can save 
massive numbers of buffer amplifiers in the input channels. The near-zero bus impedance 
also means that the gain does not alter as varying numbers of channels are routed to a bus. 
The appearance of the virtual-earth mixing concept was highly significant, as it essentially 
made low-cost mixing consoles viable. 
 There is, however, danger in being dazzled by this elegance into assuming that a virtual earth is a 
perfect earth; it is not. A typical opamp-based summing amp loses open-loop gain as frequency 
increases, making the inverting input null less effective. The ‘bus residual’ (i.e. the voltage 
measurable on the summing bus) therefore increases with frequency and can cause inter-bus 
crosstalk in the classic situation with adjacent buses running down an IDC cable. 
 As we saw in the last section on routing, a virtual-earth summing system operates at quite 
a high noise gain when many inputs are routed to it. Minimising the noise is therefore of 
prime importance, and one obvious step is to keep the impedance of the summing system as 
low as possible to reduce Johnson noise in the mix resistors. I have been involved in more 
mixing console designs than I care to contemplate, of all sizes and types, and it is interesting 
to recall that the mix resistors were always in the range of 22 kΩ to 4.7 kΩ, which seems like 
a rather narrow range of 4.7 to 1. There is a reason for this. 22 kΩ mix resistors are used in 
small budget consoles because a small number of them (say six) can be driven directly from 
a panpot without distorting its law unacceptably. Now consider a big expensive 32-group 
console where the panpot is buffered, but it has to drive 16 mix resistors on each side with 
the buffer, and making them of very low resistance would present enormous loading. The mix 
resistors will therefore be something like 6.8 kΩ; the value has only been reduced by a factor 
of about three, and Johnson noise will only be reduced by the square root of this, or 5.3 dB. 
 Mix resistors lower than this are only used for the critical L-R mix buses, where there are 
only two to be driven, and 4.7 kΩ is a common value. It actually only gives an advantage 

632 Chapter 22
of 1.6 dB over 6.8 kΩ. The lowest mixing resistors I am aware of are in fact 4.7 kΩ, and 
this value was used in the Neve VR consoles, which in their largest formats had a possible 
144 inputs going to the L-R mix bus (72 modules each with two paths to the mix bus). 
 This consideration of resistance demonstrates the difficulty of reducing the Johnson noise 
beyond a certain point by reducing the summing impedance. Halving the mix resistors doubles 
the drive power required, but only improves the noise by a factor of the square root of two. 
Johnson noise is of course only one factor; there is also the noise from the summing amplifier 
itself. The current-noise component of this is also reduced by reducing the bus impedance. 
 Apart from the noise performance, another advantage of a low summing system impedance is 
that it makes the mix buses less sensitive to capacitive crosstalk. Reducing mix resistors from 
22 kΩ to 6.8 kΩ may only give a 5.3 dB improvement in noise, but it gives a 10 dB reduction 
in capacitive crosstalk. 
 Balanced summing systems 
 As a console grows larger, the mix bus system becomes more extensive, and therefore more 
liable to pick up internal capacitive crosstalk or external magnetic fields, which are poorly 
screened by the average piece of sheet steel. The increased physical size means longer ground 
paths with non-negligible signal voltage drops across them. An expensive, but thoroughly 
effective, answer to this is the use of a balanced summing system. The basic idea is shown in 
 Figure 22.21 ; only half of the channel panpot is shown, for clarity.  
 Each mix bus is now double, having a hot (in-phase) and cold (out-of-phase) bus, exactly like 
the hot and cold wires in a balanced line connection. These run physically as close together 
as possible. At the channel end, each side of the panpot has an inverting buffer A2 that drives 
a second set of mix resistors that feed the cold mix buses. Two sections are now required for 
 Figure 22.21 : A balanced summing system 

Mixer sub-systems 633
the routing switch SW1, which is fine as most push switches are in a two-changeover format, 
but if you want switch status indication, which you normally will on a console large and 
sophisticated enough to employ balanced summing, four-changeover switches are needed – 
lots of them – and the cost jumps up. Each bus connects to a summing amplifier A3, A4 and 
their outputs are subtracted by A5 to cancel the common-mode signals. 
 A quite separate advantage of a balanced summing system is that it has a better noise 
performance, because having two buses gives you 6 dB more signal but only 3 dB more 
noise, because the noise from the two summing amplifiers is uncorrelated and partially 
cancels. This gives you a 3 dB noise advantage that it would be difficult to get by other 
methods. Against this must be counted the extra noise from the channel inverters. 
 Because of the cancellation of capacitive crosstalk that occurs, the offness of the routing 
matrix can be made very good indeed. On the last console of this type that I designed the 
offness was a barely measurable 120 dB at 20 kHz. 
 As I just noted, probably all consoles of this type will have routing switch status indication and 
so use four-changeover switches. This leaves a spare switch section doing nothing, and if you 
have followed this book so far you will have gathered it is not in my nature to leave a situation 
like that alone. In the last balanced console I designed, this fourth switch section was used to 
detect when  no routing switches were active; this happens more often than you might think on 
a large desk. In this condition an FET switcher removed the signal feed to the buffers driving 
the mix resistors. This prevented a large number of grounded resistors being pointlessly driven, 
reducing power consumption significantly, and further improving routing offness. 
 It may have occurred to you that a considerable simplification would result if the channel 
inverters were done away with and the cold resistors simply connected to ground. The signal 
level in the summing system would be 6 dB lower, exacting a 3 dB noise penalty, but the 
rejection of ground voltages and the cancellation of capacitive crosstalk would be just as 
good. This is not a sound plan. Much of the cost of balanced summing lies in the doubled 
number of mix resistors, routing switch contacts, and mix buses. The saving on inverter cost  
is relatively small. The large currents flowing in the mix resistors are now unbalanced and 
are much more likely to cause troublesome voltage drops in ground connections. 
 A variation on this approach can however be very useful in specific applications; see the 
section on ground-cancel summing systems below. 
 Ground-cancelling summing systems 
 Ground-cancel summing systems are very useful in auxiliary send systems where all sends 
are routed permanently to the bus. It gives some of the advantages of a balanced summing 
system at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it is particularly useful in consoles where the modules 

634 Chapter 22
are connected together by ribbon cabling with a relatively high ground resistance. The basic 
principle is shown in  Figure 22.22 , which represents a single channel with two aux sends. The 
ground potential of each channel is read by a low-value resistor R3, and summed into the GC 
bus; this is not a virtual-earth bus as such, but it is at a very low impedance and is essentially 
immune to capacitive crosstalk. The GC bus is then used as the ground reference for the aux 
summing system, and by subtraction it gives excellent rejection of the channel ground potentials. 
If a channel is at the remote end of the ribbon cable, then its ground resistance is relatively high 
and the local channel ground will carry a large signal potential, which is fed into the GC bus; 
conversely a channel at the near end of the ribbon cable will have a much lower ground potential, 
also fed into the GC bus. The end result is that good aux offness figures are obtained for both 
those channels. In such a system, the aux offness is defined not by the grounding arrangements 
but by the offness of the aux send pot itself, typically 90 dB with reference to fully up.  
 A couple of design points. The GC resistors R3 should be very low in value so that their 
Johnson noise contribution is negligible; the only requirement is that they are large with respect 
to the ground resistances to allow accurate subtraction. R6 is a safety resistor fitted in the aux 
master module so that it will keep working if the GC bus becomes disconnected. Without it the 
entire aux send system is dependant on the single connection A between the bus structure and 
the aux master module, and such a situation is not good practice. The only requirement is that 
R6 is high with respect to the total GC bus impedance so that the subtraction remains accurate. 
If an aux send has an on/off switch that disconnects the mix resistor from the bus, to minimise 
noise gain, the switch must also disconnect the GC resistor to maintain correct cancellation. 
 Figure 22.22 : A typical ground-cancelling summing system for aux sends 

Mixer sub-systems 635
 In some ribbon-cable consoles the grounding is reinforced by heavy (32/02) ground wires 
with push-on connectors plugged into every channel module, or in some cases every fourth 
or fifth module. Even in this case the use of a ground-cancel summing system will normally 
give a worthwhile improvement. 
 Distributed summing systems 
 Distributed summing (sometimes called devolved summing or devolved mixing) is a deeply 
cunning way of improving the noise performance of a summing system, with reference to the 
noise from the summing amps themselves. In what follows, the noise from an input channel 
and Johnson noise from the summing resistors are for the time being ignored. 
 In a distributed summing system, the contributory signals are summed in two separate stages. 
Thus if you are summing together 24 channels, you might sum them in blocks of eight, to 
get three sub-groups which are then summed together to get a single output, as shown in 
 Figure 22.23 a. Unlikely as it may seem, this two-layer summing system gives a definite noise 
advantage. Assume that every summing amplifier creates the same amount of input-referred 
voltage noise V n ; the result of this at the amplifier output then depends only on the noise gain at 
which it is working. If we sum our 24 channels into one in the normal virtual-earth manner, 
the output noise will be 25 V n , and that is our reference case. If we sum eight inputs together, 
the output noise will be only 9 V n ; three of these sub-mix outputs are now summed together, 
and you may have seen this coming – the signals sum arithmetically but the summing amp 
noise partially cancels, so the combined noise output is 9 V n times √3, which is 15.6 V n . To 
this we must add the noise of our second summing amp; this is working at a noise gain of 
only four, and so its own output noise contribution is 4 V n . Adding the uncorrelated 15.6 V n 
to 4 V n rms-fashion gives a total of 16.1 V n , which is 1.55 times or 3.83 dB quieter than the 
straightforward all-in-one-go summation of 24 inputs into one. Clever, eh?  
 The downside to this is of course that a bit more hardware is required – we are using four 
summing amplifiers rather than one. This is however a trivial extra expense compared with 
the electronics involved in 24 input channels. A more serious potential problem with this 
approach is that there is now a hidden layer of summing amplifiers which might clip without 
there being any indication on the console control surface. 
 You are by now, I hope, pondering if there is anything special about the 24 into 3 into 1 
(24:3:1) structure, or whether other variations might be better; the answer is ‘yes’. Three 
different possibilities are shown in  Figure 22.23 . Summing the 24 inputs in batches of six 
into four sub-mixes and then summing them to one (24:4:1) gives an advantage of 4.51 dB, 
while summing four at a time into six sub-mixes and then summing to one (24:6:1) gives an 
advantage of 4.97 dB, and this is the optimal solution for 24 inputs.  
 The results are summarised in  Table 22.3 , which shows that there is not much difference 
between 24:6:1 and 24:8:1, except that the latter uses a bit more hardware and is a negligible 

636 Chapter 22
0.2 dB noisier. It is hard to see why anyone would want to use the 24:12:1 structure, because 
of all those extra summing amps, but it is interesting to note that it still gives a theoretical 
noise improvement of 3.53 dB.  
 Table 22.4 illustrates the noise advantages with various forms of two layer summing for 
32 inputs; the maximum advantage is now a very useful 5.88 dB, and once again the best 
results come from first summing the inputs in batches of four. There are fewer options this 
time because 32 has less factors than 24.

 Table 22.5 shows the optimal structures giving minimum noise for various numbers of 
inputs; at first it looks as if there is something special about doing the first layer of summing 
in batches of four inputs, but as the total number of inputs reaches 72 the optimal number 
suddenly starts to rise.  
 The figures in  Table 22.5 do show a rather unsettling irregularity; for example the optimal 
structure for 80 inputs is no quieter than that for 72 inputs. This seems to be because some 
numbers of inputs have more factors than others, and so give a greater choice of structures to 
choose from.

 Two-layer distributed summing is particularly adapted to consoles built in sections, typically as 
bins of eight or 12 modules. It avoids virtual-earth buses extending over large physical areas, 
which makes them more susceptible to magnetic fields and ground voltage-drops, and can 
cause difficulties with HF stability. Each bin can now be connected by balanced low-impedance 
line connections, with the final summing done at whatever point is convenient. Both Neve and 
Focusrite have produced consoles with distributed summing systems in the past. 
 As I’m sure you have appreciated by now, I am a great one for following a train of thought until it 
derails at the points and scatters passengers all over the track. If two layers of distributed summing 
give a better noise performance,  would three layers be even better? The answer is generally, yes, 
but not by much; basically it’s not worth it. For example, the optimal two-layer structure 24:6:1 
gives a noise advantage of 4.97 dB, while the optimal three-layer structure 24:8:2:1 gives 5.24 dB; 
the improvement over two layer summing is a very small 0.27 dB. Noise performance is actually 
very slightly  worse for the 16-input case, because you have added more summing amps creating 
noise without enough partial-cancellation going on to outweigh that. 
 See  Table 22.6 for the optimal three-layer structures and their results. (Note that in the three-layer 
structures the second figure denotes the  total number of first-layer summing amps rather than the

number feeding each summing amp in the second layer.) The greatest advantage over two-layer 
distributed summing is 1.7 dB, and that is for a monster mixer with 144 paths to the mix bus; 
getting that improvement involves using 36  9  45 summing amplifiers, when the optimal 
two-layer process uses 24. That’s almost twice as many, and we must regretfully conclude that 
three-layer distributed summing is of marginal utility at best.  
 Four-layer summing anyone? Probably not; you would need a quite enormous number of 
inputs to make such a structure even faintly worthwhile. 
 Summing ampliﬁ ers 
 Figure 22.24 shows a practical summing amplifier circuit using a 5534/2 opamp; the 
accompanying insert send amplifier is included because it gives a good example of how the 
summing amp phase inversion needs to be corrected before the signal sees the outside world 
again, and it also demonstrates how to apply the ‘zero-impedance’ approach to an inverting 
stage. As mentioned before, the summing amplifiers were one of the first places that 5534/2s 
appeared in mixers, because the potentially high noise gain makes their noise performance 
critical. The circuit is very straightforward but there are a few points to watch. Firstly, the 
DC-blocking capacitor C1 is essential to prevent the bias current of the 5534/2 from making 
the routing switches clicky. It needs to be bigger than might at first appear because the relevant 
LF time constant is not C1 and the mix resistor R1 in the channel, but C1 and the parallel 
combination of all the mix resistors going to that bus. Thus for the 22K mix resistors and 
100 μF capacitor shown, if there are eight input channels the LF 3 dB point will be at 
0.59 Hz.  Table 22.7 illustrates how this works, and you can see that in this case 100 μF is 
large enough for even a big mixer. If lower values of mix resistor are used then C1 must be 
scaled up proportionally.  
 It may appear that C1 is still rather oversized for the job. This is not so. The signal in a 
mixing console passes through a large number of RC time constants on its journey from input

send ampliﬁ er that corrects the phase 

640 Chapter 22
to output, and even if each one causes only a tiny roll-off at the LF end, the cumulative effect 
on the frequency will be substantial. It is therefore essential that each LF roll-off is well 
below the normal audio band. The same considerations apply to HF roll-offs.
 There is also the important point that electrolytic capacitors distort with even small signal 
voltages across them, as described in  Chapter 2 , and so they must be much larger than might 
otherwise be required.  
 There is yet another reason to make C1 large. A summing amplifier aspires to appear as a 
short-circuit to ground, and even if it is itself perfect, the presence of C1 means that the bus 
residual voltage will rise at low frequencies, possibly causing increased LF crosstalk.  
 The capacitor C2 across the summing amp feedback resistor R2 is another vital component; 
without it the stage is pretty well guaranteed to be unstable at HF. This is because the 
mix bus has an appreciable capacitance to ground, and this will destabilise the opamp by 
adding an extra phase shift to the feedback through R2. Adding C2 compensates for this; its 
value is normally determined by experiment. It clearly must not be so large that it gives an 
appreciable HF roll-off with R2. 
 A balanced summing system as in  Figure 22.21 above can be easily made using two 
separate summing amplifiers whose outputs are then subtracted. A more economical 
method which saves an opamp is shown in  Figure 22.25 ; with equal resistor values the 
overall gain is 6 dB. The downside is that it does not generate two true virtual earths. 
The two bus residuals are only low if symmetry holds in every part of the circuit, including 
the signal levels applied to the summing resistors. I built it with a 5532 and 1% resistors 
and the bus residuals were both 61 dB (worsening above 1 kHz as usual due to opamp 
limitations). Changing either of the summing resistors or feedback resistors by 3% of their 
value increased this to 49 dB. Obviously these are not true virtual earths – more like

virtual-virtual-earths. This method was used for the main mix bus in the Mackie Onyx 
mixer, among others.  
 Hybrid summing ampliﬁ ers 
 It is well-known that at low source resistances, discrete bipolar transistors are normally 
quieter than opamps, the exception being specialised opamps like the AD797, which 
are usually ruled out on the grounds of cost. This applies to the normal run of low-cost 
transistors, though specialised types such as the 2SB737 are even better. While the advantage 
obtained varies with the number of summing resistors connected to the bus, and their value, 
in general a very desirable noise reduction of about 5 dB may be expected in a large console. 
 The hybrid combination of a discrete bipolar transistor input and an opamp to provide 
open-loop gain for linearisation and load-driving capability gives the arrangement shown 
in  Figure 22.26 . The summing bus is connected to the emitter of Q1 via the DC-blocking 
capacitor C1; the amplified signal from Q1 collector is passed to the opamp, which has 
a local feedback loop R3 which controls the DC conditions of Q1. The voltage set up on 
the non-inverting opamp input by bias network R7, R9, C5 determines the voltage at Q1 
collector. C7 acts as a dominant-pole capacitor to give HF stability. 
 An outer layer of shunt feedback via R4 is used to minimise the effect of C1 in increasing the 
bus residual at LF, by putting C1 inside this outer feedback loop. C4 prevents the non-zero

complete symmetry of component values 

642 Chapter 22
voltage at the opamp output from getting onto the bus via R4, and in the same way C6 is a DC 
blocking capacitor which prevents the following stage from putting any DC offset voltages on 
to the bus. This arrangement is effective at doing what it is supposed to, but there are clearly 
several LF time-constants involved because of the various blocking capacitors, and with such 
schemes it is essential to check that there is no peaking or other irregularity in the frequency 
response at the bottom end.  
 While the one-transistor version gives a good noise performance, it is susceptible to rail 
noise getting into the emitter or collector circuits of the transistor, and very careful filtering 
and decoupling is required to prevent this putting a limit on the noise performance. Another 
potential problem is that there will be LF signal-related voltages on the supply rails, due to 
the limited effectiveness of decoupling capacitors of reasonable size, and if these get into the 
summing amplifier they will compromise the LF crosstalk performance. An excellent fix for 
these issues is the use of a two-transistor circuit as in  Figure 22.27 . The two transistors are used 
in a balanced configuration that cancels out rail noise and makes the decoupling requirements 
much simpler; there is also no need for a biasing network as in the one-transistor version. 
 There are one or two subtleties to be observed here: the shunt feedback must go to the same 
transistor as the VE bus, to prevent large current swings in the transistors that would cause 
 Figure 22.26 : One-transistor hybrid summing ampliﬁ er 

Mixer sub-systems 643
distortion. This means that the feedback must be inverted to be in the right phase, which is done 
by U1:B. This introduces stability-threatening extra phase shifts, so HF stability capacitor C4 
bypasses the feedback inverter and goes straight to the emitter of Q2. A very useful property of 
this arrangement is that the output is in phase and so can be fed directly to a group insert.  
 A more sophisticated version of this summing amplifier, which I thought up a while 
ago, is shown in  Figure 22.28 . Here the aux master level control RV1 not only acts as a 
 Figure 22.27 : Two-transistor hybrid summing ampliﬁ er is better at rejecting noise and crosstalk 
from the supply rails

at high control settings only, improving headroom at low gain settings 

644 Chapter 22
normal gain control, but also alters the amount of negative feedback around the summing 
amplifier, effectively giving the stage variable gain. This can be extremely useful, as aux 
summing amplifiers often have large numbers of inputs feeding them and are more liable 
to clipping than group summing amplifiers. It is extremely tedious to turn down dozens of 
aux sends to remedy the situation, so being able to reduce the aux summing amp gain is 
advantageous. 
 When RV1 is at minimum, the circuit is essentially that of  Figure 22.27 , with the main shunt 
feedback path through the inverter U1:B, and the HF stabilising path through C7. The value 
of the main feedback resistor R3 is chosen so the sum amp gain is low, in this case 6.8 dB, 
and overload is unlikely. When RV1 is turned up, a positive feedback signal is sent to the 
non-inverting input of U1:B via R11 and R12, and the partial cancellation that results reduces 
the output of the inverter, decreasing the overall amount of negative feedback and increasing the 
gain of the summing amplifier. The need for a post amplifier with make-up gain is therefore 
avoided, improving the noise performance.  
 This technique was used in the Soundcraft Delta mixing console, and I modestly propose that 
it might be one reason why it won a British Design Award in 1991. My collaborator in the 
design of the Delta was Mr Gareth Connor. 
 Balanced hybrid summing ampliﬁ ers 
 In sophisticated consoles, it is desirable to combine the benefits of balanced mixing with low-
noise hybrid summing amplifiers. The obvious method of implementing this is to use two 
hybrid summing amplifiers and then subtract the result, but this uses quite a lot of hardware. 
A more elegant approach is to use a single balanced hybrid summing amplifier to accept the 
two antiphase mix buses simultaneously; this reduces noise as well as minimising parts cost 
and power consumption. 
 The circuit shown in  Figure 22.29 is at first sight very similar to that in  Figure 22.27 
above, but with the crucial difference that two mix buses now feed into the stage, one to 
each transistor emitter. To prevent distortion–inducing variations in the transistor currents, and 
to maintain symmetry, it is therefore now necessary to also apply shunt feedback to both 
transistor emitters. The feedback to Q1 is taken via an inverter to get the phase right, as in 
 Figure 22.27 , but the other feedback path is simply resistor R12. As before, C4 gives HF 
stabilisation.  
 Note that the configuration is very similar to that of the balanced microphone amplifier 
described in  Chapter 17 , and gives low noise as well as excellent symmetry. This technology 
was used extensively in the Soundcraft 3200 recording console; once again, my valued 
collaborator in the design of the 3200 was Mr Gareth Connor. 

Mixer sub-systems 645
 PFL systems 
 The prefade listen (PFL) facility goes back a long way in the history of mixers, almost 
certainly first appearing on broadcast consoles, where it proved extremely useful to be able 
to listen to a source before unleashing it on an unsuspecting public. It is also very handy in 
a recording environment, allowing you to listen to one source in isolation without undoing 
dozens of routing switches. It is invaluable for checking the level in a channel; the PFL feed 
takes over the main mix metering, which is usually much bigger and better than metering 
incorporated on a per-channel basis, if indeed there is any at all. On most mixers there is only 
room for a peak light. As the name suggests, a PFL feed is taken from before the fader, so 
that the signal is heard at full level even if the fader is down. In the USA it is often called the 
‘solo’ facility. 
 ‘PFL’ is often used as a verb, as in ‘Could you PFL channel 23?’. Interestingly, this request is 
always spelt out as P-F-L and the obvious pronunciation as ‘piffle’ has never achieved favour. 
When any PFL switch is pressed, a circuit block in the master section switches the left and 
right monitor outputs so they reproduce the PFL signal in mono, as shown in  Figure 22.30 . 
The L/R meters are also taken over by the PFL system so they can be used to check channel 
prefade levels, allowing the adjustment of input gain when required. It is common to switch 
 Figure 22.29 : Two-transistor balanced hybrid summing ampliﬁ er. Note the dual feedback paths 
via R3 and R12 

646 Chapter 22
both meters over, though of course they both read the same thing. Historically the PFL 
switching was done with a relay, but this was taken over by electronic means, specifically 4016 
analogue gates, at a relatively early date, as it is not essential for the switching to be absolutely 
click-free. The later availability of discrete FETs designed for analogue switching improved 
the linearity and much reduced (but did not wholly eliminate) the switching transients. 
 All that is required on each channel is a switch section to route the prefade-signal to the 
PFL bus, which is a simple virtual-earth bus that works in the same way as group buses, and 
another switch section to signal via a PFL-detect bus that a switch has been pressed and the 
monitor source must be changed over. The PFL-detect bus simply gathers together all the 
signals that indicate a PFL switch is pressed; it does not have to be a virtual-earth bus, but 
there are advantages in making it so, as described below. PFL switches are commonly fitted 
with indicator lights, even on quite small mixers, because otherwise it is necessary to hunt 
around the control surface if a PFL switch is inadvertently left pressed in. This does not 
make a third switch section (and therefore a four-changeover switch) necessary because the 
ingenious method shown in  Figure 22.30 can be used. All the LEDS on a channel module are 
usually run in a chain from the positive to negative supply rails; so long as there are not too 
many LEDs a simple series resistor is usually all that is needed to give more-or-less constant-
current operation of the chain. If the PFL indicator LED is put at the top of the chain, SW1-A 
removes the short-circuit from D1 and allows it to turn on, at the same time routing a DC 
signal into the PFL-detect bus via R1. (Note that the switch section SW1-A that routes the 
signal to the PFL bus uses the same high-offness configuration described earlier.)  
 Figure 22.30 : A PFL system; showing how to make a two-section PFL switch perform three 
functions at once 

Mixer sub-systems 647
 This underlines the point that economy of design in a mixer channel is very important, 
because every extra component is multiplied by the number of channels. In the master section 
the need to design out every possible component is less pressing. 
 PFL summing 
 There is nothing very difficult about the PFL summing amplifier. It is not necessary for it to 
have the best possible noise performance as it is only used for quick monitoring checks. 
The system shown in  Figure 22.31 uses a dual opamp, the second half being used to restore 
the correct phase after the inversion produced by the summing amplifier. C1 provides DC 
blocking, while R2 keeps the PFL bus at 0 V DC to prevent switch-clicks. R3 sets the gain 
from channel to PFL summer as unity, and C2 prevents the bus capacitance from causing 
instability. R4 and R5 set the gain of the re-inverting stage to unity. C3 provides DC blocking 
at the output to prevent clicks when the PFL switcher operates.  
 Figure 22.31 : An example of a PFL summing system 
 PFL switching 
 When the PFL system operates, the normal L-R mix is removed from the monitor outputs 
and is replaced by a mono feed from the PFL summing system. This is usually done by some 
form of electronic switching (see  Chapter 21 on Signal Switching for more details). 
 PFL detection 
 In early consoles, a DC voltage was simply switched into a PFL-detect bus that operated the 
PFL switching relay directly. Moving that amount of current around inside a mixer is simply 
asking for trouble, with clicks crosstalking into the summing buses, and very soon a transistor 
relay driver was added so the voltage and current levels on the PFL-detect bus could be much 
lower. When solid-state PFL switching was introduced the transistor circuitry drove analogue 
gates or discrete FETs instead. 

648 Chapter 22
 Two simple methods of PFL detection are shown in  Figure 22.32 . At 22.32a, how not to do 
it is demonstrated. When the PFL switch SW1 is closed, 17 V is applied to the PFL-detect 
bus, turning on Q1 and illuminating the ‘PFL ACTIVE’ LED D1, and turning Q2 off. The 
problem is that the 34 V edge on the PFL-detect bus (which normally sits at 17 V) has an 
excellent chance of crosstalking into the other summing buses.  
 A better method is shown in  Figure 22.32 b. Here the resistor R1 has moved to the channel 
module, and the PFL-detect bus connects directly to the base of the detect transistor Q1. 
This ensures that the PFL-detect bus can never change by more than 0.6 V, which reduces 
the possibility of clicks crosstalking capacitively into adjacent summing buses; there should 
be a 35 dB advantage. A countervailing disadvantage is that the base of Q1 is vulnerable to 
destruction if the PFL-detect line gets shorted to ground. It is also slightly more expensive to 
implement as now there has to be a resistor R1 for each PFL switch. 
 Figure 22.32 : Two simple PFL-detect systems. The second version reduces the likelihood of clicks 
getting into other buses 

Mixer sub-systems 649
 This method was workable when all mixers had motherboards, but the introduction of ribbon-
cable interconnections between mixer modules put all the buses closer together, and increased 
the likelihood of PFL-detect clicks becoming audible. 
 Virtual-earth PFL detection 
 The ideal PFL detection system would have no voltage edges on the detect bus at all. This can 
be done by detecting current instead of voltage – the PFL-detect line becomes a virtual-earth 
summing bus for DC signals. I thought this up in 1983. 
 Figure 22.33 a shows the principle. U1 is simply a summing amplifier that works at DC. 
When no PFL switches are pressed, the output of U1:A sits at 10 V because of the bias 
from resistor R2, Q1 is held on via R4, and Q2 is held off. Negative feedback through 
R3 keeps the detect bus at 0 V; C1 prevents the bus capacitance to ground from causing 
instability. The ‘PFL ACTIVE’ LED has moved to the collector of Q2 to allow for the 
logical inversion caused by the summing amplifier. When a PFL switch is pressed, the 
current injected into the detect bus by R1 overcomes that from R2 and the output of U1 
 Figure 22.33 : Virtual-earth PFL-detect systems. The second version uses the PFL-detect bus to 
reset channel mute status at power-up 

650 Chapter 22
goes below 0 V, and Q1 turns off. Note that the signalling current is only 170 μA, so there 
is little possibility of inductive crosstalk. It could probably be significantly reduced without 
problems. 
 This simple version of the system will silently detect a single PFL button down, but will 
come unstuck if more are pressed, because U1 output will hit the V rail and will no longer 
be able to maintain a virtual earth on the detect bus. This situation is not uncommon, as it 
gives a rough submix of the channels pressed, and so it is wise to cater for any number of 
PFLs at once. The circuit of  Figure 22.33 a overcomes the problem by adding diode D1, 
which clamps the opamp output so that however many PFL switches are pressed, the opamp 
output will not hit the V rail and negative feedback will continue to keep the PFL-detect 
bus very close to zero volts. The values of R4, and R5 must be carefully chosen so that the 
level-shift down to the V rail works reliably and Q1 will always switch correctly despite 
circuit tolerances.  
 Note that, once again, all the circuitry works between the V and V rails, so there is no 
chance of transients being injected into the ground system. 
 This arrangement has another less obvious advantage. It can handle signals in both directions. 
The ribbon-cable systems referred to earlier come in a number of fixed widths, so you can 
buy 40-way cable, but if you need 41 ways the next size up is 50-way. Since this increases 
the cost not only of the cable itself, but of all the connectors on it and all the mating module 
connectors, increasing the cable size is not a decision taken lightly. In one mixer design there 
was a need to send an initial-reset signal to mute-control flip-flops on each module, and all 
40-ways of the ribbon cable were committed. The only way to avoid 50-way cabling was to 
make the PFL-detect bus dual-function. 
 The idea is that by changing the reference voltage applied to the PFL-detection opamp, 
you can change the DC voltage that it maintains on the detect-bus. In Figure 22.33b, at 
power-up the initial-reset network R9, R10, C2 pulls the reference voltage going to the 
non-inverting input of U1 low for a brief period until C2 fully charges, and the PFL-detect 
bus is therefore also pulled low via R3, and this signal is coupled to each channel mute-
control flip-flop by a diode D3; the flip-flop works between positive and negative supply 
rails so it can drive muting FETs directly. After the initial-reset period the PFL-detect bus 
settles at its normal level of 0 V and D3 remains reverse-biased. D4 in the initial-reset 
network ensures rapid recovery when the power is switched off. Obviously the PFL system 
cannot function during the brief initial-reset period, but after that it works just as described 
before. 
 This is a good example of the ingenuity that is sometimes required to fit all the required 
functionality into a given size of ribbon cable. 

Mixer sub-systems 651
 AFL systems 
 AFL is a very similar concept to PFL, the difference being that an AFL feed is taken from 
after the fader, so that if a selection of AFL buttons are pressed, the resulting mix has the 
sources in the right proportion. A stereo AFL system goes one better by taking a stereo feed 
from after the panpot, so that the sources selected can be heard in their correct positions in 
the stereo field.  Figure 22.34 shows the differing points in the channel from where PFL, AFL, 
and stereo AFL are taken. Stereo AFL requires a 4-pole switch; two sections route the stereo 
signal to the AFL buses, and one is required to signal the AFL-detect system. The detection 
of an AFL condition works in exactly the same way as PFL detection.  
 It is not common for mixers to be fitted with an AFL system only, as it is much less convenient 
for checking signal levels in the channel; it will only read the prefade level correctly if the 
channel fader is at 0 dB. More usually a solo system is fitted that can be switched from PFL to 
AFL at the master section. The channel module switch will route signals to both the PFL and 
AFL buses; these are summed by separate summing amplifiers, and which of the two resulting 
signals is switched to the monitors is selected by the PFL/AFL switch on the master section. 
 Solo-in-place systems 
 PFL provides a mono look at a single channel. AFL preserves fader and perhaps pan 
position, but in both cases the signal that is heard is devoid of effects, which makes 
critical assessment difficult. A solo-in-place (SIP) system allows a channel or set of 
channels to be heard in isolation with all the effect sends working normally. This is done 
simply by muting all the channels except the ones you want to hear. This is obviously not 
 Figure 22.34 : Comprehensive system with PFL and mono and stereo AFL 

652 Chapter 22
applicable to PA work (except during set-up and sound checks) because it is what is called 
a ‘destructive solo’ in that the output of the mixer is disrupted while SIP is in use, unlike 
PFL and AFL systems which take over the monitor output but leave the group and L-R mix 
outputs unaffected. 
 A SIP system requires an electronically-controlled mute on each channel. When the SIP 
button on a channel is pressed, every  other channel is muted except that one. If two or more 
channels are solo-ed, they are left unmuted while the rest of the channels are muted. 
 The basic SIP system therefore has a SIP-detect bus, which works in just the same way as a 
PFL-detect bus. This determines when one or more SIP switches are pressed and activates a 
SIP mute bus that potentially mutes all the channels; however, if the SIP switch on a channel 
is pressed it intercepts the mute signal and prevents it from operating on that channel. The 
basic scheme is shown in  Figure 22.35 .  
 SIP is a destructive solo, and you really don’t want to trigger it during a live performance. 
Therefore a ‘solo-safe’ switch is usually fitted in the master section to act as a safety-catch or 
Molly-guard and prevent accidental operation. When it is engaged, the solo system usually 
acts as a PFL system instead, which is safe to use during performance. 
 Talkback microphone ampliﬁ ers 
 Most contemporary talkback systems have a small electret microphone mounted flush with 
the master module panel. The microphones used typically have an internal head amplifier that 
buffers the high impedance of the electret element, and all else that is needed is an amplifier 
stage with variable gain over a wide range. A typical arrangement is shown in  Figure 22.36 : 
gain is variable from 0 to 55 dB by RV1, with C4 keeping it to unity at DC. Note that the 
microphone is powered through the filter network R1 and C1.  
 Figure 22.35 : Solo-in-place system 

Mixer sub-systems 653
 Figure 22.36 includes a couple of subtle but important design features. Firstly, the second 
changeovers of the talkback routing switches are connected into the feedback network so 
that when none of them are pressed, the amplifier gain is reduced to unity. This prevents the 
microphone amplifier from clipping continuously if the gain is turned up but talkback is not 
in use; the resulting distorted waveforms would almost certainly crosstalk crunchily into 
other parts of the master module, such as the L-R mix summing amplifiers, and this would 
not be a good thing. 
 Secondly, you will have noticed that the value of C4 looks rather small compared with the 
low value of the gain end-stop resistor R3, and in fact gives an LF roll-off that is 3 dB at 
90 Hz. This is quite deliberate, and is intended to control the amplitude of LF transients when 
the gain is set high. 
 Line-up oscillators 
 The oscillator output is not required to be a perfect sinewave; it only has to be good 
enough so that meter calibration is not affected. It also needs to look like a sinewave on an 
oscilloscope, or customer confidence will be undermined.  Figure 22.37 shows a simple but

dependable arrangement for a 1 kHz oscillator which does not require either expensive and 
fragile thermistors or complicated levelling circuitry.  
 It consists of a feedback loop containing a bandpass filter and a soft clipping circuit. The 
waveform at the output of bandpass filter U1:A is amplified by U1:B and then soft-clipped by 
D1 and D2. This symmetrical clipping introduces odd-order harmonics only, which are more 
easily filtered out when the signal is fed back to the multiple-feedback bandpass filter U1:A. The 
distortion is approximately 0.5%. Note that when the oscillator is not in use, it is not routed to the 
buses, but is also firmly stopped from oscillating at all by the closure of SW1. This is essential to 
remove any possibility of the oscillator crosstalking into the audio paths during normal operation. 
When SW1 is opened, this oscillator ramps up in amplitude in a very neat manner. 
 You will note the use of E24 resistor values to get the frequency as close to 1.0 kHz as 
possible, and the parallel combination of R6 and R7 to give 745 Ω; this resistance is 
fairly critical for obtaining the minimum distortion, and the combination shown here gave 
dependably lower distortion than the E24 value of 750 Ω. The output level is dependant on 
the forward voltage of the two diodes and so there is some variation with temperature, but it 
is insignificant in this application. 
 The next step up in oscillator sophistication is to provide two switched frequencies, usually 
1 kHz and 10 kHz. The higher frequency was historically used for checking the azimuth

adjustment of tape machine heads (when the azimuth of a tape head is maladjusted, the high 
frequency response falls off badly). Nowadays it is less useful but can still come in handy for 
quick frequency response checks. It is therefore very important that the output level is exactly 
the same for the two frequencies, and the oscillator shown in  Figure 22.38 therefore has a 
more complex level-control loop.  
 The oscillator is based on the classic Wien bridge configuration, with the oscillation 
frequency controlled by R8, R9, C1 and R5, R6, C2. When running at 1 kHz R8, R9, and R5, 
R6 are in circuit. For 10 kHz SW1 is pressed and R5 and R9 are now shorted out, raising the 
operating frequency. The level control loop operation is as follows: when SW2 is pressed, 
the short-circuit across R1 in the negative feedback loop R1, R2 which prevents oscillation is 
removed and the amplitude of oscillation ramps up. When it reaches the desired level, Zener 
diode D1 begins to conduct on positive peaks and turns on the common-base transistor Q1 
(D1 also conducts on negative half-cycles, but Q1 does not respond and is protected from 
reverse bias by clamp D2). The collector current of Q1 charges C3 and Q2 turns on, pulling 
down the gate of JFET Q3 and increasing its channel resistance, thus increasing the amount 
of negative feedback through R1, R2 and regulating the level. Q3 is a J112 FET, a type that 
is optimised for voltage-controlled resistance (VCR) operation. The network R3, R4 not only 
acts as the collector load for Q2, but also feeds half the V ds of Q3 to its own gate; this is a

classic method of reducing even-order distortion in JFETs and is dealt with in more detail 
in  Chapter 24 . C3 and R10 set the time-constant of the control-loop, and their values have a 
strong effect on oscillator distortion. Q1 and Q2 can be any high-beta transistor types. 
 Larger mixers often have more sophisticated oscillators with fully variable frequency and 
sometimes a choice of a squarewave output. Oscillator design is a massive subject on its own, 
and there is no space to get deeper into it here. 
 Console cooling and component lifetimes 
 Large mixing consoles have a large amount of electronics packed into a small space, both to 
reduce the size of the console so it is easier to install, and to bring all the controls within a 
reasonable reach. This means that natural convection cooling is often barely adequate. It is 
made more difficult by the fact that open cooling vents on the top of a console are not popular 
due to the possibility of various beverages being poured into the works, with an excellent 
chance of catastrophic results. Elevated internal console temperatures are rarely high enough 
to cause semiconductor failures, but have two bad consequences: 
 Firstly, over time the electrolytic capacitors will dry out, and drop in value. This loss of 
capacitance can be dramatic; a 100 μF component can fall to 10 nF. This in turn causes two 
further bad consequences: the LF response of the console degrades as coupling capacitors 
drop in value, and opamps go unstable as rail decoupling capacitors become ineffective. In 
a large studio console this can mean that its life is only ten years before all the electrolytics 
need replacing. This ‘recapping’ procedure, is, as you might imagine, a lengthy and expensive 
process that can be done only by companies with specialised skills. 
 The average electrolytic capacitor has a temperature rating of 85 °C. This does not mean that 
no capacitor degradation occurs below that temperature; degradation is happening all the time, 
but it accelerates rapidly as temperature rises, roughly doubling in speed with each 10 °C 
increase. 85 °C is the temperature at which capacitor life has dropped to a nominal 1000 hours, 
which is only 49 days, and so obviously they must be operated at a much lower temperature 
than that to get a reasonable equipment lifetime. Electrolytic capacitors rated at 105 °C 
have recently fallen in price to the point at which they are a viable alternative, and at a given 
temperature this increases lifetime by a factor of four. The best recapping facilities use low-
ESR 105 °C capacitors exclusively for replacements, and in strategic places increase the value 
fitted so the life is longer before the value falls too low. This obviously requires an intimate 
knowledge of highly complex consoles and should only be undertaken by professionals such 
as GJC Designs [1]. 
 Secondly, if silver contacts are used in switches or relays, the rate at which they are corroded 
by atmospheric hydrogen sulphide, creating non-conducting silver sulphide and causing the 

Mixer sub-systems 657
contacts to fail, also increases rapidly with temperature. Once again it roughly doubles in 
speed with each 10 °C increase. 
 The obvious way to improve console cooling is to add fans to increase the air flow. Fans 
are very undesirable in consoles installed in recording studios because of the acoustic noise 
they generate, and are rarely if ever used. They are however sometimes fitted in PA consoles, 
though still with considerable care to minimise the noise they create. When this is done by 
running the fan at low speeds, at the low end of its specified voltage range, great caution is 
needed. After a period of use the fan may stop altogether, as the bearings become worn, and 
how long this takes is not readily predictable. Sleeve bearings seem to be worse than ball 
bearings for this. The use of fans is to a large extent a last resort, and every effort should be 
made to induce adequate cooling by convection alone.

 Level indication and metering 
 Signal-present indication 
 Some amplifiers and the more sophisticated mixers are fitted with a ‘signal-present’ indicator 
that illuminates to give reassurance that a channel is receiving a signal and doing something 
with it. The level at which it triggers must be well above the noise floor, but also well below 
the Peak indication or clipping levels. Signal-present indicators are usually provided for each 
channel, and are commonly set up to illuminate when the channel output level exceeds a 
threshold something like 20 or 30 dB below the nominal signal level, though there is a wide 
variation in this. 
 A simple signal-present detector is shown in  Figure 23.1 , based on an opamp rather than a 
comparator. The threshold is 32 dBu, which combined with the 2 dBu nominal level which 
it was designed for, gives an indication at 30 dB below nominal. Since an opamp is used 
which is internally compensated for unity gain stability, there is no need to add hysteresis to 
prevent oscillation when the signal lingers around the triggering point. U1 is configured as 
an inverting stage with the inverting input biased slightly negative of the non-inverting input 
by R4 in the bias chain R3, R4, R5. The opamp output is therefore high with no signal, but 
is clamped by negative feedback through D1 to prevent excessive voltage excursions at the 
output which might crosstalk into other circuitry; C2 is kept charged via R6 and R7, so Q1 
is turned on and LED1 is off. When an input signal exceeds the threshold the opamp output 
goes low and C2 is rapidly discharged through R6 and D2. R6 limits the discharge current 
to a safe value; the overload protection of the opamp would probably do this by itself, but I 
have always been a bit of a belt-and-braces man in this sort of case. With C2 discharged, 
Q1 turns off and LED1 illuminates as the 8 mA of LED chain current flows through it. When 
the input signal falls below the threshold, the opamp output goes high again, and C2 charges 
slowly through R7, giving a peak-hold action. This is a unipolar detector; only one polarity of 
signal activates it. 
 The LED chain current is provided by a wholly conventional constant-current source Q3, 
which allows any number of LEDs to be turned on and off without affecting the brightness of 
the other LEDs. In this case the clip-detect LED is shown just above the signal-present LED; 
since it is only illuminated when the signal-present LED is already on, the drive requirements 

660 Chapter 23
for Q2 are simple and it can be driven from exactly the same sort of capacitor-hold circuitry. 
The other LEDs in the chain (here assumed to be routing switch indicators) simply ‘float’ 
above the LEDs controlled by transistors. The LED chain is connected between the two 
supply rails so there is no possibility of current being injected into the ground. This gives 
a span of 34 V, allowing a large number of LEDs to be driven economically from the same 
current. The exact number depends on their colour, which affects their voltage drop. It is of 
course necessary to allow enough voltage for the constant-current source to operate correctly, 
plus a suitable safety margin. 
 I have used this circuit many times in mixers and it can be regarded as well-proven.  
 A vital design consideration for signal-present indicators is that since they are likely to 
be active most of the time, the operation of the circuitry must not introduce distortion 
into the signal being monitored; this could easily occur by electrostatic coupling or 
imperfect grounding if there is a comparator switching on and off at signal frequency. 
Avoid this.

Other LEDs are run in the same constant-current chain 

Level indication and metering 661
 Peak indication 
 A mixer has a relatively complex signal path, and the main metering is normally connected only 
to the group outputs. The mix metering can be used to measure the level in other parts of the 
signal path by use of the PFL system (see  Chapter 22 ) if fitted, but this can only monitor one 
channel at a time. It is therefore usual to guard against clipping by fitting peak level indication 
to every channel of all but the simplest consoles, and sometimes to effect-return modules also. 
 The Peak indicator is driven by fast-attack, slow-decay circuitry so that even brief peak 
excursions give a positive display. It is important that the circuitry should be bipolar, i.e. it will 
react to both positive and negative peaks. The peak values of a waveform can show asymmetry 
up to 8 dB or more, being greatest for unaccompanied voice or a single instrument, and this 
is, of course, very often exactly what goes through a mixer channel. This level of uncertainty 
in peak detection is not a good thing, so only the simplest implementations use unipolar peak 
detection. Composite waveforms, produced by mixing several voices or instruments together, 
do not usually show significant asymmetries in peak level.  
 Figure 23.2 shows a simple unipolar peak LED driving circuit. This only responds to positive 
peaks, but it does have the advantage of using but two transistors and is very simple and 
 Figure 23.2 : A simple unipolar peak detector, including powering for the Chan On LED 

662 Chapter 23
cheap to implement. When a sufficient signal level is applied to C1, Q1 is turned on via the 
divider R1,R2; this turns off Q2, which is normally held on by R4, and Q2 then ceases to 
shunt current away from peak LED D1. C2 acts as a Miller integrator to stretch the peak hold 
time; when Q1 turns off again, R4 must charge C2 before Q2 can turn on again. Note that this 
circuit is integrated into the channel on LED supply, with R5 setting the current through the 
two LEDs; the channel on LED is illuminated by removing the short placed across it by SW1. 
R5 is of high enough value, because it is connected between the two supply rails, for there to 
be no significant variation in the brightness of one LED when the other turns off. If, for some 
reason, this was a critical issue, R5 could be replaced by a floating constant-current source. 
Other LEDs switched in the same way can be included in series with the channel on LED. 
 This peak detect circuit has a non-linear input impedance and must only be driven from 
a low-impedance point; preferably direct from the output of an opamp. The peak LED 
illuminates at an input of 6.6 V peak, which corresponds to 4.7 Vrms (for a sinewave) and 
16 dBu. For typical opamp circuitry running off the usual supply rails this corresponds to 
having only 3 or 4 dB of headroom left. The detect threshold can be altered by changing the 
values of the divider R1, R2. 
 The Log Law Level LED (LLLL) 
 The Log Law Level LED or LLLL was evolved for the Elektor preamplifier project of 2012, 
to aid in the adjustment of a phono input with several different gain options. It is, to the best 
of my knowledge, a new idea. Usually, a single-LED level indicator is driven by an opamp 
or a comparator, and typically goes from fully off to fully on with less than a 2 dB change 
in input level when fed with music ( not steady sinewaves). It therefore only gives effectively 
one bit of information. 
 It would be useful to get a bit more enlightenment from a single LED. More gradual 
operation could be adopted, but anything that involves judging the brightness of an LED is 
going to be of doubtful use, especially in varying ambient lighting conditions. The LLLL, 
on the other hand, uses a comparator to drive the indicating LED hard on or hard off. It 
incorporates a simple log-converter so that the level range from LED always-off to 
always-on is much increased, to about 10 dB, the on-off ratio indicating where the level lies 
in that range. In some applications, such as the Elektor preamplifier, it may be appropriate to 
set it up so that the level is correct when the LED is on about 50% of the time. This gives a 
much better indication.  
 The circuitry of the LLLL is shown in  Figure 23.3 . The U1:A stage is a precision rectifier 
circuit that in conjunction with R3 provides a full-wave rectified signal to U1:B; this is 
another precision rectifier circuit that establishes the peak level of the signal on C1. This is 
buffered by U2:A and applied to the approximately log-law network around U2:B. As the 

Level indication and metering 663
signal level increases, first D6 conducts, reducing the gain of the stage, and then at a higher 
voltage set by R9, R10, D7 conducts and reduces the gain further. If sufficient signal is 
present (to exceed the threshold set by R11, R12) the output of open-collector comparator 
U3:A goes low and U3:B output goes high, removing the short across LED1 and allowing 
it to be powered by the 6 mA current-source Q1. As with other circuitry in this chapter, the 
LED current is run from rail to rail, avoiding the ground. Many other LEDs can be inserted in 
the constant-current LED chain. The LLLL has been built in significant numbers and I have 
never heard of any problems with it. 
 If a stereo version of the LLLL is required, which will indicate the greater of the two input 
signals, the output of comparator U3:A is wire-ORed with the output of U3:C, which has the 
same function in the other channel; the circuitry up to this point is duplicated. A more elegant 
way to make a stereo version would be to combine the outputs of two peak rectifiers to charge 
C1. This would save a handy number of components but I have not yet actually tried it out. 
 I have spent some time testing the operation of this scheme, using various musical genres 
controlled by a high-quality slide fader. I believe it is a significant advance in signalling level 
when there is only one LED available, but in the words of Mandy Rice-Davies, ‘Well, he 
would say that, wouldn’t he’ [1]. Opinions on the value of the LLLL would be most welcome. 
 Distributed peak detection 
 When an audio signal path consists of a series of circuit blocks, each of which may give 
either gain or attenuation – and the classical example is a mixer channel with multiple EQ 
stages and a fader and post-fade amplifier – it is something of a challenge to make sure that 
 Figure 23.3 : The Log Law Level LED or LLLL 

664 Chapter 23
excessive levels do not occur anywhere along the chain. Simply monitoring the level at the 
end of the chain is no use because a circuit block that gives gain, leading to clipping, may 
be followed by one that attenuates the clipped signal back to a lower level that does not trip 
a final peak-detect circuit. The only way to be absolutely sure that no clipping is happening 
anywhere along the path is to implement bipolar peak detection at the output of every opamp 
stage. This is, however, normally regarded as a bit excessive, and the usual practice in high-
end equipment is to just monitor the output of each circuit block, even though each such 
block (for example a band of parametric EQ) may actually contain several opamps. It could 
be argued that a well-designed circuit block should not clip anywhere except at its output, no 
matter what the control setting, but this is not always possible to arrange.  
 A multi-point or distributed peak detection circuit that I have made extensive use of is shown 
in  Figure 23.4 . It can detect when either a positive or negative threshold is exceeded, at any 
number of desired points; to add another stage to its responsibilities you need only add another 
pair of diodes, so it is very economical. However, if one peak detector monitors too many 
points in the signal path, it can be hard to determine which of them is causing the problem. 
In most applications I have used the circuit to keep an eye on the output of the microphone 
preamplifier, the output of the EQ section, and the output of the fader post-amplifier. This 
means that the location of the clipping can be pinpointed quite easily. If you pull down the 
fader to 0 dB or below and the peak LED goes out, the problem was at the post-fade amplifier. 
If that doesn’t do the trick, switch out the EQ; this assumes of course that the EQ in/out switch 
removes the signal feed to the unused EQ section. I always arrange matters so if possible, 
removing the EQ signal reduces power consumption and minimises the possibility of crosstalk. 
If that is not the case, then you will have to back off any controls with significant boost and 
see if that works. Should the peak indication persist, it must be coming from the output of the 
microphone preamplifier, and you will need to reduce the input gain. 
 The operation is as follows. Because R5 is greater than R1, normally the non-inverting input 
of the opamp is held below the inverting input and the opamp output is low. If any of the 
 Figure 23.4 : A multipoint bipolar peak detector, monitoring three circuit blocks 

Level indication and metering 665
inputs to the peak system exceed the positive threshold set at the junction of R4, R3, one of 
D1, D3, D5 conducts and pulls up the non-inverting input, causing the output to go high. 
Similarly, if any of the inputs to the peak system exceed the negative threshold set at the 
junction of R2, R6, one of D2, D4, D6 conducts and pulls down the inverting input, once 
more causing the opamp output to go high. When this occurs C1 is rapidly charged via D7. 
The output-current limiting of the opamp discriminates against very narrow noise pulses. 
When C1 charges Q1 turns on, and illuminates D8 with a current set by the value of R7. R8 
ensures that the LED stays off when U4 output is low, as it does not get close enough to the 
negative supply rail for Q1 to be completely turned off. 
 Each input to this circuit has a non-linear input impedance, and so for this system to work 
without introducing distortion into the signal path, it is essential that the diodes D1–D6 are 
driven directly from the output of an opamp or an equivalently low impedance. Do not try to 
drive them through a coupling capacitor as asymmetrical conduction of the diodes can create 
unwanted DC-shifts on the capacitor. 
 The peak-detect opamp U4 must be a FET-input type to avoid errors due to bias currents 
flowing in the relatively high value resistors R1–R6, and a cheap TL072 works very nicely 
here; in fact the resistor values could probably be raised significantly without any problems. 
 As with other non-linear circuits in this book, everything operates between the two supply 
rails so unwanted currents cannot find their way into the ground system. 
 Combined LED indicators 
 For many years there has been a tendency towards very crowded channel front panels, 
driven by a need to keep the overall size of a complex console within reasonable limits. One 
apparently ingenious way to gain a few more square millimetres of panel space is to combine 
the signal-present and peak indicators into one by using a bi-colour LED. Green shows 
signal-present, and red indicates peak. One might even consider using orange (both LED 
colours on) for an intermediate level indication. 
 Unfortunately, such indicators are hard to read, even if with normal colour vision. If you have 
red-green colour-blindness, the most common kind (6% of males, 0.4% of females), they are 
useless. Combining indicators like this is really not a good idea. 
 VU meters 
 VU meters are a relatively slow-response method of indicating an audio level in ‘volume 
units’. The standard VU meter was originally developed in 1939 by Bell Labs and the USA 
broadcasters NBC and CBS. The meter response is intentionally a ‘slow’ measurement 

666 Chapter 23
which is intended to average out short peaks and give an estimate of perceived loudness. 
This worked adequately when it was used for monitoring the levels going to an analogue 
tape machine, as the overload characteristic of magnetic tape is one of soft compression 
and the occasional squashing of short transient peaks is hard to detect aurally. Digital 
recorders overload in a much more abrupt and intrusive manner, making even brief overloads 
unpleasant, and the use of VU meters in professional audio has been in steady decline for 
many years. 
 The specifications, particularly of the dynamics, of a standard VU meter are closely defined 
in the documents British Standard BS 6840, ANSI C16.5-1942, and IEC 60268-17, but there 
are many cheap meters out there with ‘VU’ written on them that make no attempt to conform 
with these documents. The usual VU scale runs from 20 to 3, with the levels above zero 
being red. 1 VU is the same change in level as 1 dB. The rise and fall times of the meter are 
both 300 msec so if a sine wave of amplitude 0 VU is applied suddenly, the needle will take 
300 msec to swing over to 0 VU on the scale. A proper VU meter uses full-wave rectification 
so asymmetrical waveforms are measured correctly, but the cheap pretenders normally have 
a single series diode that only gives half-wave rectification. VU meters are calibrated on the 
usual measure-average-but-pretend-it’s-RMS basis, so a VU meter gives a true reading of 
RMS voltage level only for a sinewave. Musical signals are usually more peaky than sine 
waves so the VU meter will read somewhat lower than the true RMS value. 
 The 0 VU mark on the meter scale is ‘zero-reference level’ but what that means in terms of 
actual level depends on the system to which it is fitted. In professional audio equipment, 
0 VU is 4 dBu, whereas in semi-pro gear it will be 10 dBv ( 7.8 dBu) 
 VU meters consist of a relatively low resistance meter winding driven by rectifier diodes, 
with a series resistor added to define the sensitivity. The usual value is 3k6 which gives 0 VU 
 4 dBu. They therefore present a horribly non-linear load to an external circuit, and a VU 
meter must never be connected across a signal path unless it has near-zero impedance. This 
is particularly true for cheap ones with half-wave rectification. In practice, a buffer stage is 
always used between a signal path and the VU meter to give complete isolation and to allow 
the calibration to be adjusted. Many mixers have a nominal internal level 6 dB below the 
nominal output level, because the balanced output amplifiers inherently have 6 dB of gain, 
and so the meter buffer amplifiers must also be capable of giving 6 dB of gain.  
 Figure 23.5 shows an effective design for a meter buffer stage designed to work with a nominal 
internal level of 6 dBu, and which must therefore give 10 dB of gain to raise the meter signal 
to the 4 dBu that will give a 0 VU reading. C1 provides DC blocking, because a VU meter 
will respond to DC as well as AC. R1 and R2 set the gain range to be 6 to 13 dB, which 
is an ample range of adjustment. With the preset centralised, the gain is 9.3 dB. The resistor 
values are unusually high because presenting a high input impedance is more important 
here than the noise performance. An amplifier which was noisy enough to register directly 

Level indication and metering 667
on a VU meter would probably be better fitted to a life as a white noise generator. R3 is an 
isolating resistor to make sure that the capacitance of the cable to the VU meter, which may 
be quite lengthy if the meter is perched up in an overbridge, does not cause instability in the 
buffer amplifier; its presence in series with the meter resistor R4 is allowed for when the 
calibration is set. The ground of the meter itself is labelled ‘dirty ground’ to underline the 
point that the current through the meter will be heavily distorted by the rectification going on, 
and must not be allowed to get into the clean audio ground. 
 Because of their slow response, VU meters are sometimes made with a peak LED projecting 
through the meter scale. This is driven by a peak-detect circuit of the sort described earlier in 
this chapter. 
 PPM meters 
 Peak programme meters (PPMs) are essentially peak-reading instruments that respond much 
more quickly than VU meters. They are always a good deal more expensive, partly because 
of the precisely defined and rather demanding characteristics of the physical meter itself – 
for example, the needle has to be able to move much faster than a VU needle, but without 
excessive overshoot – and partly because they need much more complex drive circuitry. The 
PPM standard was originally developed by the BBC in 1938, as a response to the inadequacy 
of existing average-responding meters. PPMs have a distinctive scale with white legends and 
a white needle against a black background, and are marked from 1 to 7. This is a logarithmic 
scale giving 4 decibels per division, and the accurate and temperature-stable implementation 
of this characteristic is what makes the drive circuitry expensive. 
 Figure 23.5 : A very simple but effective design for a VU meter buffer stage 

668 Chapter 23
 Nonetheless, PPMs are specifically designed  not to catch the very fastest of transient peaks, 
and are therefore sometimes called ‘quasi-peak’ meters. They only respond to transients 
sustained for a defined time; the specs give ‘Type I’ meters an integration time of 5 msec, 
while ‘Type II’ meters use 10 msec. The result is that transient levels normally exceed the 
PPM reading by some 4 to 6 dB. This approach encourages operators to somewhat increase 
programme levels, giving a better signal-to-noise performance. The assumption (which is 
generally well-founded) is that occasional clipping of brief transients is not audible. The 
existence of both Type I and II meters simply reflects differing views on the audibility of 
transient distortion. 
 PPMs exhibit a slow fallback from peak deflections, so it is easier to read peak levels 
visually. Type I meters should take 1.4 to 2.0 seconds to fall back 20 dB while Type II meters 
should take 2.5 to 3.1 seconds to fall back 24 dB. Type II meters also incorporate a delay 
of from 75 msec to 150 msec before the needle fallback is allowed to begin; this peak-hold 
action makes reading easier. 
 LED bar-graph metering 
 Bar-graph meters are commonly made up of an array of LEDs. An LED bar-graph meter can 
be made effectively with an active-rectifier circuit and a resistive divider chain that sets up the 
trip voltage of an array of comparators; this allows complete freedom in setting the trip level 
for each LED. A typical circuit which indicates from 0 dB to 14 dB in 2 dB steps with a 
selectable peak or average-reading characteristic is shown in  Figure 23.6 and illustrates some 
important points in bar-graph design.  
 U3 is a half-wave precision rectifier of a familiar type, where negative feedback servos 
out the forward drop of D11, and D10 prevents opamp clipping when D11 is reverse-
biased. The rectified signal appears at the cathode of D11, and is smoothed by R7 and C1 
to give an average, sort-of-VU response. D12 gives a separate rectified output and drives 
the peak-storage network R10, C9 which has a fast attack and a slow decay through R21. 
Either average or peak outputs are selected by SW1, and applied to the non-inverting inputs 
of an array of comparators. The LM2901 quad voltage comparator is very handy in this 
application; it has low input offsets and the essential open-collector outputs. 
 The inverting comparator inputs are connected to a resistor divider chain that sets the trip 
level for each LED. With no signal input, the comparator outputs are all low and their open-
collector outputs shunt the LED chain current from Q1 to 15 V, so all LEDs are off. As 
the input signal rises in level, the first comparator U2:D switches its output off, and LED 
D8 illuminates. With more signal, U2:C also switches off and D7 comes on, and so on, until 
U1:A switches off and D1 illuminates. The important points about the LED chain are that the 
highest level LED is at the bottom of the chain, as it comes on last, and that the LED current 
flows from one supply rail down to the other and is not passed into a ground. This prevents 

Level indication and metering 669
noise from getting into the audio path. The LED chain is driven with a constant-current 
source to keep LED brightness constant despite varying numbers of them being in circuit; 
this uses much less current than giving each LED its own resistor to the supply rail and is 
universally used in mixing console metering. Make sure you have enough voltage headroom 
in the LED chain, not forgetting that yellow and green LEDs have a larger forward drop 
than red ones. The circuit shown has plenty of spare voltage for its LED chain, and so it is 
possible to put other indicator LEDs in the same constant-current path; for example D9 can 
be switched on and off completely independently of the bar-graph LEDs, and can be used to 
indicate Channel-on status or whatever. An important point is that in use the voltage at the top 
of the LED chain is continually changing in 2-volt steps, and this part of the circuit must be 
kept away from the audio path to prevent horrible crunching noises from crosstalking into it. 
 This meter can of course be modified to have a different number of steps, and there is no need 
for the steps to be the same size. It is as accurate in its indications as the use of E24 values in 
the resistor divider chain allows.

670 Chapter 23
 If a lot of LED steps are required, there are some handy ICs which contain multiple open-collector 
comparators connected to an in-built divider chain. The National LM3914 has 10 comparators 
and a divider chain with equal steps, so they can be daisy-chained to make big displays, but 
some law-bending is required if you want a logarithmic output. The National LM3915 also 
has 10 comparators, but a logarithmic divider chain covering a 30 dB range in 3 dB steps. 
 A more efﬁ cient LED bargraph architecture 
 The bar-graph meter shown in  Figure 23.6 above draws 6 mA from the two supply rails 
at all times, even if all the LEDs are off for long periods, which is often the case in 
recording work. This is actually desirable in a simple mixer as the ±15 V or ±17 V rails 
are also used to power the audio circuitry and step-changes in current taken by the meter 
could get into the ground system via decoupling capacitors and suchlike, causing highly 
unwelcome clicks. 
 In larger mixers, a separate meter supply is provided to prevent this problem and this allows 
more freedom in the design of the meter circuitry. In the example I am about to recount, the 
meter supply available was a single rail of 24 V; this came from an existing power supply 
design and was not open to alteration, negotiation, or messing about with. A meter design 
with 20 LEDs was required, and an immediate problem was that you cannot power 20 LEDs 
of assorted colours with one chain running from 24 V; two LED chains would be required 
and the power consumption of the meter, even when completely dormant, would be twice 
as great. I therefore devised a more efficient system, which not only saves a considerable 
amount of power, but also actually economises on components.  
 The meter circuit is shown in  Figure 23.7 , and I must admit it is not one of those circuit 
diagrams where the modus operandi exactly leaps from the page. However, stick with me. 
 There are two LED chains, each powered by its own constant-current source Q1, Q2. The 
relevant current source is only turned when it is needed. With no signal input, all LEDs 
are off; the outputs of comparators U10 and U20 are high (open-collector output off) and 
both Q1 and Q2 are off. The outputs of all other comparators are low. When a steadily 
increasing signal arrives, U20 is the first comparator to switch, and LED D20 turns on. 
With increasing signal, the output of U19 goes high, and the next LED, D19, turns on. This 
continues, in exactly the same way as the conventional bargraph circuit described above, 
until all the LEDs in the chain D11–D20 are illuminated. As the signal increases further, 
comparator U10 switches and turns on the second current source Q2, illuminating D10; 
the rest of the LEDs in the second chain are then turned on in sequence as before. This 
arrangement saves a considerable amount of power, as no supply current at all is drawn 
when the meter is inactive, and only half the maximum is drawn so long as the indication 
is below 2 dB. 

 Figure 23.7 : A more efﬁ cient LED bar-graph meter 

672 Chapter 23
 There are 10 comparators for each LED chain, 20 in all, so a long potential divider with 
21 resistors would be required to provide the reference voltage for each comparator if it was 
done in the conventional way, as shown in  Figure 23.6 above. However, looking at all those 
comparator inputs tied together, it struck me there might be a better way to generate all the 
reference voltages required, and there is. 
 The new method, which I call a ‘matrix divider’ system, uses only 10 resistors. This is 
more significant than it might at first appear, because the LEDs are on the edge of the PCB, 
the comparators are in compact quad packages, and so the divider resistors actually take 
up quite a large proportion of the PCB area. Reducing their number by half made fitting 
the meter into a pre-existing and rather cramped meter bridge design possible without 
recourse to surface-mount techniques. There are now two potential dividers. Divider A 
is driven by the output of the rectifier circuit, while Divider B produces a series of fixed 
voltages with respect to the 8.0 V sub-rail. As the input signal increases, the output of the 
meter rectifier goes straight to comparators U16–U20, which take their reference voltages 
from Divider B and turn on in sequence as described above. Comparators U11–U15 are 
fed with the same reference voltages from Divider B, but their signal from the meter 
rectifier is attenuated by Divider A, coming from the tap between R3 and R5, and so these 
comparators require more input signal to turn on. This process is repeated for the third 
bank of comparators U6–U10, whose input signal is further attenuated, and finally for the 
fourth bank of comparators U1–U5, whose input is still further attenuated. The result is 
that all the comparators switch in the correct order. 
 Since in this application there was only a single supply rail, a bias generator is required to 
generate an intermediate sub-rail to bias the opamps. This sub-rail is set at 8.0 V rather 
than V/2, to allow enough headroom for the rectifier circuit, which produces only positive 
outputs; it is generated by R18, R19 and C3 and buffered by opamp section U3:B. The 
main 24 V supply is protected by a 10 Ω fusible resistor R22, so if a short-circuit occurs 
on the meter PCB the resistor will fail to open and the whole metering system will not be 
shut down. This kind of per-module fusing is very common and very important in mixer 
design; it localises a possibly disabling fault to one module, and avoids having the power 
supply shut down, which would put the whole mixer out of action. A small but vital point 
is that the supply for Divider B is taken from outside this fusing resistor; if it was not the 
divider voltages would vary with the number of LED chains powered, upsetting meter 
accuracy. 
 Once again the LM2901 quad voltage comparator is used, as it has low input offset voltages 
and the requisite open-collector outputs. Q1, Q2 can be any TO-92 devices with reasonable 
beta; their maximum power dissipation, which occurs with only one LED on in the chain, is a 
modest 128 mW. This meter system was used with great success.

 Vacuum ﬂ uorescent displays 
 Vacuum fluorescent displays (VFDs) are sometimes used as bargraph meters [2]. They 
are superior to LCDs as they emit a bright light and show good contrast. Their operation 
is similar to that of a triode valve; a metal-oxide coated cathode gives off electrons when 
electrically heated, and their movement is controlled by wire grids. If they are directed to 
hit one of the multiple phosphor-coated anodes, it fluoresces, giving off light. The colour 
can be controlled by selecting appropriate phosphors. The cathode runs at a much lower 
temperature than in conventional valves, and does not visibly glow. The cathode heating 
voltage is usually 2–3 V, and this is often supplied as a balanced centre-tapped drive to 
minimise brightness variations across the display. This voltage is inconveniently low and 
the current inconveniently high for many applications so an inverter with a transformer 
is used. The same transformer may be used to generate the anode voltage, usually 50 
to 60 V. 
 VFDs require hefty tooling charges if you want a custom display and their awkward power 
requirements make them more complicated to use than LEDs, especially because of the need 
for an electrically noisy inverter. One of the best known applications of a VFD was in the 
classic Casio FX-19 scientific calculator [3] that appeared in 1976. I bought mine then and it 
is still working perfectly; it is my calculator of choice because the display is brilliantly clear 
under all conditions. VFDs pre-dated LCDs, but they are still very much in use where high 
contrast is required. My Blu-Ray player has one. 
 Plasma displays 
 A plasma display [4] consists of a large number of gas-filled cells between two glass plates, 
which glow when energised with a high voltage. The cells are addressed by long electrode 
strips which run in the X-direction on one glass plate and in the Y-direction on the other. 
When voltages are suitably applied, only the cell at the crossing point of one X and one Y 
electrode will glow. Plasma displays were used in the SSL 4000 and 5000 consoles, and 
in the Neve V1, V2 V3 and VR consoles, amongst others. These were neon-filled, giving 
an orange glow. The plasma modules used by Neve combined PPM and VU characteristic 
bargraphs in one module; each bargraph was composed of 100 steps. They operate from 
248 V DC, a voltage which requires considerable respect. That does not in itself make driving 
the displays difficult, because such a voltage can be switched with a couple of MPSA42/92 
transistors. This only needs to be implemented once as the switching of the steps is done by a 
multiplexing process. 
 Since plasma televisions, working on the same basic principle but showing three colours, 
are available for reasonable prices (£340 for a 43-inch model in June 2013) you might be 

674 Chapter 23
surprised to learn that a single-channel plasma display module for console use costs £250, 
presumably due to the small production quantities involved. 
 Liquid crystal displays 
 The ultimately versatile metering system is provided by making the meter display from 
a number of colour LCD display screens [5]. These can be of the size used in the smaller 
laptop computers, butted side-to-side to make something like a conventional meterbridge, or 
larger screens that can show three or more rows of bar-graphs at once. All the Calrec digital 
consoles currently have such metering. The advantages are obviously that you can display 
any kind of metering that you can think up, and the cost is low because the technology can 
be based on standard laptop screen displays and graphics chips, which are made in enormous 
quantities.

 Level control and special circuits 
 Gain-control elements 
 A circuit block that gives voltage-control of gain is a difficult thing to implement. The basic 
function is simply that of multiplication, but most of the practical techniques introduce 
significant distortion. In every case distortion and noise can be traded off by altering the 
operating level, but in some techniques the non-linearity is so great that a compromise that 
meets modern performance standards is simply not possible. 
 A brief history of gain-control elements 
 The difficulty of implementing a good voltage-variable gain element is testified to by the 
number of technologies that have been tried. A variable attenuator could be made by varying 
the current flow through diodes, which varied their effective resistance; the control signal 
inevitably got mixed up with the audio signal, and linearity was poor. Optical combinations 
of filament bulbs and cadmium-sulphide photoresistors gave very good control-signal 
isolation but operation was slow because of the thermal inertia of the filament. Later versions 
used LEDs and were much faster but the linearity of the photoresistors remained a limitation. 
Chopper systems, which turned the signal hard on and off at an ultrasonic frequency, with 
a variable mark-space ratio, and then reconstructed the signal with a low-pass filter, gave 
fast response and reasonable linearity. However it was difficult to get a wide control range 
and effectively removing all the switching frequencies required a fairly complicated filter. A 
long time ago I designed just such a variable attenuator, using 4016 analogue gates for the 
switching, and a clock frequency of 160 kHz. The gain was difficult to control below 40 dB 
and it never made it to production, which on the whole was probably just as well. 
 JFETs 
 The introduction of JFETs (junction-FETs as opposed to MOSFETs) as gain control devices 
was a great advance. These devices promised good isolation between control-voltage and 
signal, instantaneous operation, and lower distortion than existing methods. These advantages 
do exist, but there are some less desirable features, such as a highly non-linear gain/CV 
law that varies significantly from specimen to specimen, as a result of process tolerances. 
Signal-CV isolation is absolute in the DC sense, the gate looking like a very-low-leakage 

676 Chapter 24
reverse-biased diode, but there is always some gate-channel capacitance which means that 
fast edges on the control voltage can get through to the signal path. 
 The use of JFETs for on/off signal control rather than voltage-controlled attenuation is 
covered in  Chapter 21 on signal switching. 
 A JFET used as a voltage-controlled attenuator is operated below pinch-off, i.e. at low values 
of V ds that allow it to operate more like a resistor than a constant-current source. Some 
JFET types are better than others for this job, the 2N5457 and the 2N5459 being particularly 
favoured in the mid-Seventies.  
 Figure 24.1 shows the most basic voltage-controlled JFET attenuator circuit. When 
N-channel FETs are used, as is normally the case, the control voltage must go negative of 
ground to turn off the JFET and give the minimum-attenuation condition. The maximum 
attenuation is limited by the R ds(on) of the JFET to about 45 dB for practical circuitry. The 
attenuation law is highly non-linear, and variable between specimens of the same JFET; to 
some extent this can be trimmed out by applying a constant DC bias to the control voltage, 
but minor variations in the shape of the control law still remain. One of the advantages of 
this circuit is that when there is no gain reduction, the JFET is biased hard off and there is 
no extra distortion introduced, though there will be Johnson noise from the series resistor. 
This makes JFETs useful in limiter applications where gain reduction occurs only briefly and 
intermittently; JFETs are much cheaper than VCAs.  
 Figure 24.1 : The basic voltage-controlled JFET attenuator circuit 
 With the JFET conducting, the major non-linearity is second-harmonic distortion, which can 
be much reduced by adding half the drain-source voltage to the gate control voltage, as in 
 Figure 24.2 . Note that it is half the drain-source voltage that is applied, not half of the input 
signal. The ratio is not critical – getting it right within 10% seems to give all the linearisation 
available. A serious problem with this circuit is the control-voltage feedthrough into the 
signal path. One answer is to add a DC blocking capacitor C as in  Figure 24.3 ; this stops DC, 
but does nothing to stop fast transient feedthrough.  
 Another problem is that the presence of C adds an extra low-pass time-constant to the applied 
control voltage. In feedback limiters this can cause instability of the control loop, typically 

Level control and special circuits 677
causing the gain reduction to suddenly snap to the maximum value, followed by a slow decay 
back to normal operating conditions. This is not a good thing. Both problems can be solved 
by using a unity-gain buffer amplifier to isolate the JFET gate network from the signal path, 
as shown in  Figure 24.4 .  
 Figure 24.2 : Second-harmonic distortion can be much reduced by adding half the drain-source 
voltage to the gate control voltage 
 Figure 24.3 : Adding blocking capacitor C prevents DC getting into the signal path, but does 
nothing to stop transient feedthrough 
 Figure 24.4 : Using an active buffer instead of a blocking capacitor prevents both DC and 
transient feedthrough 

678 Chapter 24
 Because of their unhelpful control-laws, JFETs were most useful in feedback-type 
compressors and limiters, where the feedback loop linearised the law; more on that later. I 
produced a compressors/limiter design for  Wireless World [1] when the application of FETs 
in this way was relatively new; it was published some years after I designed it. The linearity 
limitation remains, and JFETs are now rarely used in compressors and limiters (except for 
those which deliberately embrace obsolescent technologies), having been replaced by VCAs. 
They are however still useful in noise-gates, because as shown above, they can be configured 
so that when the noise-gate is open, the JFET is firmly off and introduces no signal 
degradation at all. A JFET is also much cheaper than a VCA. 
 Operational transconductance ampliﬁ ers 
 An operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) gives a current output for a voltage 
difference input, and the amount of current you get for a given input voltage is determined 
by the current that is made to flow into a control port, giving a variable-gain capability. The 
output stage is a high-impedance current-source rather than the low-impedance voltage-
source of the conventional opamp, and the output current must be converted to a voltage, 
usually using a simple resistive load. Buffering is then needed to give a low-impedance 
output. Despite the name – operational transconductance amplifier – this device is not used 
like a conventional opamp when it is being used to give variable gain. There is no negative 
feedback around the device, as this would prevent the gain varying, and for acceptable 
linearity the differential input voltages should be kept to 20 mV or less. Distortion is mostly 
third harmonic, and comes from the input pair transistors. 
 The best known operational transconductance amplifier was the CA3080E and a typical 
voltage-controlled gain circuit for it is shown in   Figure 24.5  . A1 is the OTA, R1 and R2 reduce 
the input level so it is suitable for the device input transistors, R3 is the I/V conversion resistor 
and A2 is a conventional opamp acting as the output buffer. The THD is about 0.15% for a 5 
dBu input level. Note the OTA symbol has a current source symbol attached to its output.  
 Figure 24.5 : A typical gain-control circuit using the 3080E operational transconductance ampliﬁ er 

Level control and special circuits 679
 Another OTA, called the LM13600, was introduced later by National Semiconductor; this 
is a dual part and has distortion-compensation diodes in the input stage, which are claimed 
to have improved linearity fourfold. I have to say that I found that the difference in practical 
applications was not that large. It also has built-in Darlington output buffers. The LM13600 
has now been replaced by the LM13700; the CA3080E went out of production in 2005. The 
LM13700 is used in much the same way as the CA3080E. 
 You are probably thinking by now that transconductance amplifiers belong in the history 
section of this chapter; they are placed here because their flexibility has kept them very 
popular with builders of analogue synthesisers. 
 Voltage-controlled ampliﬁ ers 
 Voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) is the name given to a specific kind of variable gain 
device. It is essentially a four-quadrant multiplier and is a current-in, current-out device, which 
therefore needs some support circuitry if it is to interface with the normal voltage-driven world. 
 Since the input port is a virtual-earth, converting the input voltage into an input current 
requires only a resistor; see R1 in the basic circuit of  Figure 24.6 . Converting the output 
current into an output voltage is less easy and requires a shunt-feedback amplifier A1, as it 
is essential to avoid signal voltages on the output port. This is a transadmittance amplifier 
(current-in, voltage-out). An important advantage of this circuit is that is does  not phase-
invert. It looks as if it does – the amplifier A1 certainly inverts – but so does the VCA 
internally, so the output remains in phase, which is of course essential for mixing console use. 
 Because of their log/antilog operation VCAs are characterized by an exponential control 
characteristic, so gain varies directly in decibels with control voltage. This is extremely 
convenient as it means that a linear fader can be used to control gain over a wide range; 
however, this is in practice less than ideal as it spreads out the less important higher 
attenuation range too much. Special ‘VCA-law’ faders are made that squeeze the high 
attenuation range so the normal operating range can be expanded. 
 Figure 24.6 : The basic gain-control circuit using a VCA 

680 Chapter 24
 The evolution of VCA technology started in about 1970, based on the ‘Blackmer gain cell’ 
developed by David Blackmer of dbx, Inc., and VCA history is a fascinating field in itself; 
see reference [2]. Another of the very early models was the Allison EGC-101, which gave 
improved linearity through Class-A operation [3]. The study of the internal operation of 
VCAs is also a big subject, and regrettably I don’t have the space to go into the details here. 
An article in  Studio Sound [4] gives a good deal of information on the internals. Other useful 
sources of information on the technology are references [5] and [6].  
 For many years the ‘standard’ VCA was the DBX2150, of which I have deployed more than 
I care to contemplate in VCA sub-group systems and console automation; more modern ones 
are represented by parts like the THAT 2181. A typical application circuit suitable for both is 
shown in  Figure 24.7 .  
 You will note that a symmetry trim pot is required; this is set to minimise second harmonic 
generation. A THD analyser is required to make this adjustment, but on the positive side, 
once set it stays set, and need never be touched again unless the VCA is replaced. Modern 
VCAs are very good; the THD at 1 Vrms with 0 dB gain can be as low as 0.002%. The 
off-isolation (or offness, as I prefer to call it) can be as good as 110 dB at 1 kHz, but will 
almost certainly be worse at higher frequencies as it depends on stray capacitance. This is 
why the SIP package is preferred; as shown in  Figure 24.7 , it keeps the input and output pins 
as far apart as possible. A crucial layout requirement is that the ‘hot’ end of R1 is kept as far 
 Figure 24.7 : A typical gain-control circuit using the 2150 VCA. The 8-pin SIP package is almost 
always used for VCAs 

Level control and special circuits 681
away as practicable from Pin 8 of the VCA, even if it means extending the track between R1 
and VCA Pin 1. This track is at virtual earth and susceptible to capacitive crosstalk so keep 
unrelated signals well away from it. 
 The control law (which is set by transistor physics, and is therefore dependable) is 6 mV/dB 
at the actual VCA control pin, and this is inconveniently low. A scaling amplifier A2 is 
therefore used so the control voltage has a more useful range, such as 0 to 10 V. The presence 
of this amplifier also gives the opportunity for control voltage filtering and changes of ground 
reference. The voltage applied to the control port must be at low impedance (basically an 
opamp output is the only source that will do) and absolutely free from contamination by 
any sort of signal or avoidable noise. Contamination with even a trace of the signal being 
controlled will cause excess distortion. 
 The capacitor C1 shown across the I–V conversion opamp feedback resistor is always required 
for HF stability, due to the destabilising capacitance seen looking into the VCA output port.  
 In other places in this book I have described how noise can be reduced by using multiple 
transistors or multiple opamps in parallel. This also works with VCAs; you simply put N of 
them in parallel and connect their outputs to a single shunt-feedback amplifier with a suitably 
reduced feedback resistor, as shown in  Figure 24.8 . Two VCAs give a 3 dB improvement and 
 Figure 24.8 : Using multiple VCAs in parallel to reduce noise. Each doubling of numbers 
theoretically reduces noise by 3 dB 

682 Chapter 24
four a 6 dB benefit. There are of course limits as to how far you can go with this sort of thing; 
high-quality VCAs are relatively expensive. Four in parallel have been used in high-quality 
compressor/limiters such as the Connor. Eight VCAs are employed by That Corporation in 
their 202 module which is used in high-end consoles such as those by SSL. 
 Compressors and limiters 
 Compressors and limiters are devices that control the dynamic range of a signal. The device 
acts like a rapid volume control that reduces the gain when the signal level becomes excessive. 
 A compressor reduces the general dynamic range of a signal for the majority of the time. A 
typical application is control of microphone levels when the talent does not make microphone 
technique their top priority. This means that it is applying some amount of gain reduction 
most of the time, so the gain-control element is active and it is important that it is relatively 
distortion-free and without other audible defects. 
 A limiter, by contrast, has as its main function the prevention of overload and horribly 
audible clipping. When loudspeakers and AM transmitters are being driven it may actually 
prevent expensive equipment damage. Transmitters require the extra protection of a clipper 
circuit; see the separate section on these. Since a limiter operates relatively rarely (assuming 
the system is being operated correctly) it is less important that the gain-control element is 
distortion-free. 
 Figure 24.9 shows the relationships between input and output levels for compression and 
limiting. The compressor law begins gain reduction at a lower threshold level, and has a 
 Figure 24.9 : Compressor and limiter laws 

Level control and special circuits 683
moderate slope thereafter; the slope shown here is 3:1, which is typical. The limiter law has 
a higher threshold and only acts when overload is imminent; the slope is much flatter so that 
even very high signal levels cannot reach the overload point; the slope here is 10:1.  
 Compressors and limiters do a similar job, using much the same hardware with different 
parameter settings, so the functions are often combined in a compressor/limiter. 
 Figure 24.10 gives the block diagram of a feedback compressor/limiter. The output signal 
is amplified, and if it exceeds a certain threshold, applied to a rectifier with a fast-attack 
slow-decay characteristic. This part of the system is called the sidechain, to emphasise 
that the signal does not pass through it. The resulting control voltage is applied to the 
gain-control element and as the signal level increases the gain is reduced, reducing the 
variations in output level. The sidechain may use either peak or RMS sensing; the latter 
is considered by some to relate better to our perception of loudness and give a less 
obtrusive effect. 
 The laws shown in  Figure 24.9 have ‘hard knees’ as the gain laws change abruptly at the 
threshold. A ‘soft knee’ slowly increases the compression ratio as the level increases, giving a 
curve that gradually attains the desired compression ratio. A ‘soft knee’ is considered to make 
the change from uncompressed to compressed less audible, especially for higher compression 
ratios. 
 If the threshold is set low, and the sidechain gain is also low, the system works as a 
compressor, the gain reduction acting to reduce the general dynamic range of the output 
signal, hopefully without obvious side-effects. If the threshold is set high, and the sidechain 
gain is also high, we have a limiter instead. The signal will be untouched until it exceeds 
the threshold, and then gain reduction is applied strongly to prevent the output level 
significantly increasing.  
 Figure 24.10 : Block diagram of a feedback compressor/limiter 

684 Chapter 24
 Compressor/limiters can work in either feedforward or feedback modes, each of which 
has its own advantages and problems. In the feedback mode the compression law tends to 
be inherently linear because of the feedback around the level-control loop. The feedback 
configuration has the advantage that the output level set does not depend on the control-
voltage law of the gain element.  
 With feedforward, as in  Figure 24.11 , the compression law depends on the control-voltage 
law of the gain element. If this is a VCA with a very predictable law, no problem. However, 
other gain elements such as FETs sometimes have their uses – with FETs the advantage is that 
there is no signal degradation when there is no gain reduction. There is, however also a highly 
non-linear control-voltage law to deal with, and it is not practical to bend this into a more 
desirable log law. 
 The way to solve this is shown in  Figure 24.12 , which assumes that two matched gain 
elements are easier to make than one with the required law. The sidechain path contains a 
feedback limiter and the control voltage this generates is fed to the second gain element, 
which acts in feedforward mode. Typically the gain elements are matched as well as possible 
by trimming.  
 So far we have assumed that the sidechain dynamics consist only of two simple time-
constants for attack and decay. In many cases this will give rise to objectionable effects, and 
more sophisticated control measures have been developed to deal with the problems. Even 
if a gain-control element is completely linear when the control voltage is fixed, rapid CV 
changes put distortion into the waveform. 
 Figure 24.11 : Block diagram of a feedforward compressor/limiter 

Level control and special circuits 685
 Attack artefacts 
 When a fast attack is used to control level (typically when the unit is being used as a limiter) 
and prevent overshoot, it tends to bite chunks out of the controlled waveform, as a natural 
consequence of a rapid drop in gain. Isolated cases of this usually pass unnoticed, but 
repeated occurrences are perceived as a crackling noise. This can be controlled by the use 
of dual attack times, with the faster time switched in if the signal peak exceeds criteria for 
amplitude and rate of rise, but the only complete solution to this problem is a delay-line 
compressor/limiter, as seen in   Figure 24.13 .  
 A delay in the signal path between the side-chain takeoff point and the gain element allows 
a feedforward sidechain to react relatively slowly and still have the gain reduced before 
the signal peak reaches the gain-control element (this is not possible with the feedback 
compressor/limiter configuration because the sidechain feed is taken  after  the gain-control 
element, and therefore after the delay). The difficulty is that the signal is delayed at all times; 
this will cause problems if it is being mixed with undelayed signals, and furthermore the delay 
section has to be of high quality as it passes the main signal, not just the sidechain information. 
A well-known BBC design of circa 1967 used a strictly analogue 320 μsec delay-line made up 
of ten LCR second-order all-pass filter sections [7]. This worked very well but is obviously an 
expensive technique. An active filter delay-line would be cheaper but still involves a significant 
amount of circuitry and a number of close-tolerance components. Nowadays a high-quality 
digital delay using 24-bit converters can be constructed relatively easily.

 Decay artefacts 
 Since the sidechain contains either a peak or RMS detecting rectifier, the timing capacitor 
will have on it a ripple waveform resulting from cyclical charge and discharge, exactly as 
in a power-supply reservoir capacitor. This waveform modulates the signal path gain and 
generates distortion; the effect can be severe. In most compressor/limiter usage the attack 
time has to be fast, but often the decay time can be made much longer, reducing the 
amplitude of the ripple and reducing distortion. However, in some applications the decay has 
to be short for rapid recovery from brief level excursions, or the general level of the signal 
will be unduly depressed. An effective and widely-adopted solution to this problem is the use 
of dual time-constants. See  Figure 24.14 for a simple implementation, where the short time-
constant R1, C1 responds to short-term level changes while the long time-constant R2, C2 
copes with the general trend. 
 Another elaboration is a hold circuit which prevents the decay from beginning if any 
attack events have occurred in, say, the preceding 20 msec. This helps to prevent sudden 
and obvious gain changes, often called by the highly descriptive term ‘pumping’. If 
the noise background is significant, as with many live news recordings, then even slow 
gain changes produce a distracting effect called ‘breathing’, because that's just what it 
sounds like. 
 Subtractive VCA control 
 While modern VCAs are very good, they still introduce more noise and distortion than a 
typical well-designed chain of 5532 opamps and, as mentioned above, FETs are therefore still 
favoured for some compressor/limiter applications as they introduce no degradation when 
 Figure 24.13 : Block diagram of a feedforward compressor/limiter with delay 

Level control and special circuits 687
not bringing about gain reduction. However, the predictable characteristics of VCAs are very 
attractive, and it would be nice to combine the advantages of both. 
 This can be done; whether I invented the technique first I have no idea, but it was all a long 
time ago. The concept, as shown in  Figure 24.15 , is not to send the signal through a VCA 
with 0 dB gain when no gain reduction is required, but to have the VCA normally hard off 
and then turn it on to reduce the gain. When the VCA is off, the circuit acts as a simple unity-
gain inverting amplifier, and there is minimal signal degradation.  
 Note that point about inverting – this circuit phase inverts although the standard VCA circuit 
does not. As the VCA gain is turned up, it lets more signal current through to the summing 
point of A1, and since this is out of phase, due to the internal inversion of the VCA, there is 
partial cancellation and the overall gain falls. When the VCA is set to 0 dB gain theoretically 
there is complete cancellation and the overall circuit is off. In practice the tolerances in R1, 
R3 and in the VCA set a limit to the practicable minimum gain, but the range is more than 
enough for effective dynamics control. 
 Figure 24.14 : Dual decay time-constant circuit 
 Figure 24.15 : A VCA gain control arranged so that no signal passes through it when no gain-
reduction is occurring 

688 Chapter 24
 You may have spotted the potential snag. If the gain of the VCA goes above 0 dB (which 
corresponds with a control voltage of 0 V) the overall gain will begin to rise again. With a 
feedback type compressor/limiter this could be disastrous as the sidechain will try to reduce 
the gain, but it will simply increase it further, and the system will latch up solid. This can 
be prevented by the simple expedient of using an active clamp circuit to prevent the control 
voltage rising even a millivolt above 0 V. Note that because of the subtractive action the 
gain law is no longer linear in dBs, and so this plan is better suited to feedback compressor/
limiters. I put this system into a broadcast console in 1990 and it worked very well. 
 Noise gates 
 A noise gate allows a signal through only when it is above a set threshold; the gate is said to 
be open or on. When the signal level drops below the threshold, the signal is either attenuated 
or stopped altogether and the gate is closed or off. For effective noise reduction the level of the 
signal must be above that of the noise; the threshold is set above the noise level so when there 
is no signal the gate closes. Noise gates are not actually often used to discriminate against noise 
as such; in recording they are more likely to be used to, for example, increase the isolation 
between the signals coming from a multi-mic’d drum kit. They are also used to provide the 
well-known ‘gated reverb’ effect, where decaying reverb is cut off suddenly by a noise gate. 
 A noise gate is a rather different animal from a compressor/limiter. Its operation is much more 
on/off, and long time-constants are not normally used. This means that the non-linearity of an 
FET during intermediate degrees of gain reduction can be tolerated. In the traditional form of 
FET noise-gate, as shown in  Figure 24.16 and based on a design I did some years ago, FET 
distortion is reduced by attenuating the signal considerably – in this case by 32 dB – before 
applying it to the FET stage. This is done by R1, R4 and the signal is at a low impedance 
afterwards to keep noise down. The FET (actually two FETs here, to reduce R ds(on) and give 
a greater gain change) is at the bottom of the NFB network of a low-noise hybrid amplifier 
stage that restores the signal to its original level when the FET is on. When the FET is off, the 
gain is reduced to unity. This would only give an offness of 32 dB, which is not enough, 
so the network R9, PR1, R8 is added, which lets a little signal through to what is effectively 
an inverting input to the amplifier stage; when PR1 is correctly adjusted there is effective 
cancellation and the offness can easily exceed 80 dB. FET distortion is further reduced by 
adding half the drain-source voltage to the gate control voltage via buffer A3, as described earlier. 
 The low-noise amplifier is a hybrid stage, combining the low-noise of the discrete input 
transistor Q1 with the open-loop gain and linearity of opamp A1. R2, R6 set up the DC 
conditions for Q1, while servo integrator A2 defines the DC operating point of A1, keeping its 
output at 0 V on average. Q2 is a current-source that helps keep rail noise out of the collector 
circuit of Q1. The alert reader will spot the similarity between this stage and the moving-coil 
preamplifier stage in  Chapter 12 . The noise from the amplifier with the gate off is 106 dBu. 

Level control and special circuits 689
 Many noise gates have a ‘range control’ that allows the offness to be reduced if a more subtle 
effect is required. This is RV1 in  Figure 24.16 , an ordinary log pot that has the bottom of its track, 
which would normally be grounded, connected instead to the noise gate output. Offness is reduced 
by advancing the control so that some of the signal gets through even when the gate is off. 
 The sidechain of a noise gate is similar to that of a compressor/limiter, but there is a greater 
emphasis on fast attack times of 50 μsec or less, and special circuitry is used to charge the 
timing capacitor as quickly as possible.  
 Noise gates can also be made with VCAs, and this is the more usual method when a 
‘dynamics section’ which can act as either a noise gate or a compressor/limiter, is squeezed 
into a mixer channel.

 Clipping 
 Since clipping and its attendant distortion is something we normally strive to avoid, it may 
be thought perverse to study ways in which to induce it. Clipping circuits do have their uses, 
however. One application is in the protection of AM transmitters, where even momentary 
excursions beyond 100% modulation are unacceptable, because they lead to legal problems 
(sideband splatter causes the regulator to close you down) and technical problems (the 
transmitter blows up). Either way you're off the air. Limiters are the first line of defence, but 
they are liable to overshoot and maladjustment. A fixed-level clipping circuit, however, can 
absolutely prevent any signal exceeding its threshold. Clipping circuitry also has specialised 
uses in power amplifier design, where it can emulate the performance of a much more 
complex and expensive regulated power supply [8], or increase the flexibility of bridged 
amplifiers [9]. 
 To set down some of the requirements for the perfect clipping circuit: 
1.  Clipping must be at well-defined symmetrical levels, constant with frequency and not 
dependant upon signal history. 
2.  The top of the clipped waveform should be absolutely flat, to give tight level control. 
3.  The clipping level must be arbitrarily settable, without steps. 
4.  There must be absolutely no degradation of the signal below the clipping threshold – or at 
any rate no more than would be caused by going through an ordinary single opamp stage. 
 This last requirement is actually much more demanding than it appears, but it is essential. 
Let us examine the problem. I appreciate that clean audio clipping may be a bit of a minority 
interest, but it will be highly instructive to see just what difficulties arise, and how they can be 
overcome. 
 Diode clipping 
 If you look up ‘clipping circuits’ in the average textbook, you will probably find something 
like  Figure 24.17 , where back-to-back diodes conduct when the signal exceeds their 
conduction threshold.  
 This fails to meet our requirements in several ways. Firstly, the gradual onset of conduction 
in the diodes means that the clipping is soft, infringing requirements two and four. And, 
secondly, it breaks three as well, because the clipping level can only be altered by changing 
the number of diode pairs used, giving 0.6 V steps. 
 Figure 24.18 shows the force of this, the result of using various numbers of pairs of 1N4148 
silicon signal diodes. The lower line descending from left to right is the noise floor, getting

spacing of the curves as diode pairs are added is due to the logarithmic X-axis for input level

relatively lower as the input level increases. With one pair of diodes distortion is already 
clearly above the noise floor for an input as low as 100 mVrms. The gradual increase 
in distortion after this as level increases shows that the clipping is distinctly soft, and so 
introduces unacceptable distortion long before it effectively controls the level. An obvious 
extra snag is that a passive circuit like this has a significant output impedance; in most 
applications some sort of output buffering like A1 will be required.  
 The very gradual onset of clipping shown above is due to the slow way in which the 
exponential conduction law of diodes begins. The clipping action can be made much sharper 
by connecting each diode to a suitable bias voltage so that it is firmly reverse-biased at low 
signal levels, and only conducts when the signal is significantly above the bias voltage. The 
bias chain must have a low impedance to give a steep clipping characteristic, and so diodes 
are also used to establish the voltages. It would, of course, be possible to generate near-zero 
impedance supplies by using opamps to buffer resistive dividers (which also allow complete 
flexibility in setting the clipping threshold). However, if opamps are to be employed there are 
better ways to use them, as we shall see later in this chapter.  
 A biased clipping circuit is shown in  Figure 24.19 , and the resulting distortion performance 
in  Figure 24.20 , for both one and two pairs of diodes in the biasing chain. The much steeper 
rise in distortion shows that the onset of clipping is much sharper; compare Trace 6 in 
 Figure 24.18 with Trace 1 in  Figure 24.20 .  
 Figure 24.19 : A biased diode clipping circuit 

Level control and special circuits 693
 The clipping action of simple circuits like this is, however, still some way short of perfect, 
in that the clipped part of the waveform is not a dead flat horizontal line. Diodes do not 
suddenly become short-circuits when they start to conduct and the clipped part of the 
waveform bulges upwards somewhat. Clearly we need active circuitry to sharpen up the 
diode action. 
 Active clipping with transistors 
 The next step up in sophistication from simple diodes is the use of transistors for clipping. 
This is an active process, in that the voltage applied to the base turns on the collector current. 
It is not simply a matter of using the base-collector or base-emitter diodes to replace the 
simple diodes in the previous section. 
 Figure 24.21 a shows a basic transistor clipper with NPN and PNP devices shunting the signal 
path, and  Figure 24.22 shows the distortion performance. A buffer is required for a low-
impedance output; trace A in  Figure 24.22 shows the result without an output buffer and trace 
B shows the result with it. In the latter case not only has the noise floor dropped, due to less 
pickup on what is now a low-impedance output, but the distortion at a given level has risen 
significantly, as the low-pass action of a capacitive screened cable driven from a medium 
impedance has been eliminated.

Level control and special circuits 695
 In  Figure 24.21b , the circuit is arranged so that extra drive is applied to the transistor bases 
via R2, because of the voltage drop across R1. This pulls down the clipped part of waveform 
in the centre, and with a correct choice of values gives improved flatness. The circuit is based 
on a concept by Stefely. The distortion plot in  Figure 24.23 is not very different.  
 Active clipping with opamps 
 Opamps are noted for their versatility. However, using them to do precision clipping, with 
low distortion below the clipping point, is more difficult than it at first appears. Here I 
examine three ways of doing it, as the limitations of the first two approaches are highly 
instructive. 
 Clipping by clamping 
 The first attempt is the direct descendant of the diode clipping circuits examined above, 
and uses two active clamps A1, A3 to constrain the voltage at point A, downstream of the 
4K7 resistor, as shown in  Figure 24.24 . Normally this point is between the two clipping 
thresholds, so the inverting input of A1 is positive of V t , and the opamp output is saturated 
negatively. D1 is therefore firmly reverse biased and A1 has no effect on the voltage at A. 
Likewise, normally the inverting input of A2 is negative of V t , and D2 is held off.

696 Chapter 24
 When the voltage at X tries to exceed V t , the output of A2 swings negative and D2 pulls 
down point A to prevent it. The diode imperfections are servoed out by the open-loop gain of 
A2, so the clipping threshold is exactly V t , neglecting opamp offsets and other minor errors. 
In the same way, if point X tries to go below V t , the output of A1 swings positive and D1 
conducts to clamp the output at this voltage. Like the passive diode clipper above, this circuit 
has a significant output impedance (4K7 in normal operation) and so buffer A2 is added to 
give a low output impedance. 
 The two clipping thresholds can be set to any desired voltage as they are derived from 
resistive dividers. They can of course be different, though an application where this might be 
useful is not that easy to visualise.  
 The clamping-clipper circuit gives very clean clipping, but falls down badly on the distortion 
it adds to signals below the clipping threshold of 2.2 Vrms.  Figure 24.25 shows that 
distortion reaches an unacceptable 0.035% at 10 kHz and 2 Vrms; the 2 V trace is lower at 
LF because the relative noise floor is lower. This distortion occurs because point X is at a

output buffer A2 is essential to give a low output impedance

significant impedance, and is connected to two opamps with JFET inputs, typically TL072s. 
These have non-linear capacitances to the IC substrate, and cause distortion that worsens with 
frequency and level, as shown in  Figures 24.25 and  24.26 . See  Chapter 4 for more details 
of this distortion mechanism. This effect could be eliminated by using opamps with bipolar

inputs but then the bias currents have to be dealt with. One advantage of this circuit is that it 
does not phase-invert, unlike most active clipper circuits.  
 Figure 24.26 shows that at 10 kHz distortion is beginning to appear when the input exceeds 
300 mVrms, and rises slowly until clipping begins just above 2 Vrms.  
 Negative-feedback clipping 
 Having found that clipping in the forward path has significant problems, we move to a 
configuration where this takes place in the negative-feedback loop, so the clipped output can 
be taken from an opamp output at low impedance. This also makes interfacing with the next 
stage simpler. 
 The circuit in  Figure 24.27 works as follows: with no input, point X sits at 5 V and point 
Y sits at 5 V. When the output heads positive, eventually Y is pulled positive of the 0 V at 
the A1 inverting input, and D2 starts to conduct, reducing gain and giving clipping. Similarly, 
on sufficiently large negative output excursions, D1 will conduct. The clipping characteristic 
is rather soft; the gain cannot be reduced entirely to zero above the threshold because of the 
diode forward impedance in series with the source resistance of the 2K2–1K bias network. 
The latter can be reduced by using lower resistance values but this loads the opamp output 
excessively, and draws more power from the supply rails.  
 Figure 24.27 : A negative-feedback clipper; the clipping threshold is set by the voltages at X and Y 

Level control and special circuits 699
 This configuration gives less sub-threshold distortion than the previous circuit by a factor 
of roughly three at 10 kHz, but it is still a long way from our requirement for ‘absolutely 
no degradation of the signal’ which some of you are by now probably thinking was a bit 
ambitious. 
 The distortion for a 3 Vrms input, which is well below the clipping threshold for this circuit, 
is shown by curve A in  Figure 24.28 , and it is instructive to wheel out the scientific method 
to find out what is going wrong with the linearity. The previous clamping-clipper circuit ran 
into trouble by driving non-linear opamp inputs from a non-zero impedance; that cannot be 
happening here as both opamp inputs are at zero voltage, the inverting input so because there 
is always a healthy amount of shunt feedback.  
 So what might be the problem? We know that opamps have their linearity degraded by 
excessive output loading, and the two bias networks, being connected to rails that are 
effectively at AC ground, represent a significant load of (2.2K  1K) in parallel with 
(2.2K  1K) which works out to a total load of 1.6K on the output. This is quite enough to 
degrade the linearity of most opamps (see  Chapter 4 ), but the idea is still only a hypothesis 
and needs testing.

700 Chapter 24
 This can be done experimentally by means of the circuit in  Figure 24.29 , which uses a separate 
voltage-follower A2 to drive the two bias networks, the clean output being taken off before it. 
Our hypothesis looks good, as eliminating the loading on A1 has much reduced the distortion, 
giving Plot B in  Figure 24.28 . This, however, still falls somewhat short of perfect linearity. 
 The distortion remaining in Plot B is due to negative feedback through the non-linear diode 
capacitances while they are still reverse-biased, i.e. below the clipping threshold. This can be 
demonstrated by disconnecting the output of A2 so clipping is disabled and points X and Y 
do not move. The diodes are still connected to the summing point at the inverting input of A1, 
which also does not move, and we now get Plot C in  Figure 24.28 , which is essentially the 
testgear distortion plus a little circuit noise.  
 Putting extra opamps in a negative feedback loop is not something to be entered into lightly 
or inadvisedly, because of the danger that accumulating phase-shifts can make the loop 
unstable. However, it often works if the extra opamp is configured as a voltage-follower 
because the 100% local feedback in the follower makes its bandwidth as great as possible and 
significantly greater than that of an inverting stage, which works at a noise-gain of 2. Here it 
works dependably. 
 While this circuit is some way short of perfection, it can be useful sometimes, especially if 
there happens to be a spare opamp half left over to act as the buffer A2 in  Figure 24.29 . Don’t 
forget that this circuit gives a phase inversion. 
 Figure 24.29 : A modiﬁ cation of Figure 24.8 that removes the loading distortion from the signal path 

Level control and special circuits 701
 Feedforward clipping 
 The Attempt 2 clipper demonstrated one way to reduce sub-threshold distortion, but it also 
highlighted the difficulty of getting hard clipping and tight level control by using negative-
feedback techniques. While feedback is a most powerful technique, it is not the only way; 
sometimes feedforward does it better. 
 The circuit of a feedforward clipper is shown in  Figure 24.30 . Below the clipping level it acts 
simply as a unity-gain inverting stage, with the forward path through R1. This configuration 
eliminates common-mode distortion in A2 during normal operation. 
 The clipping circuit consists of two shunt-feedback precision rectifiers A1, A3 that are biased 
by currents injected into their summing points via R2, R3 so they conduct only above the 
desired clipping threshold. A1 handles negative clipping; R2 injects 15V/47K  319 μA 
into the summing node of A1, and as long as this exceeds the current being pulled out of this 
node via R5 during negative inputs it will be counteracted by feedback through D2. When the 
current through R5 exceeds that injected by R2, the opamp output must go positive so it can

shown 

702 Chapter 24
maintain its inverting input at ground by feedback through D1 and R6. As before, the gain of 
the opamp A1 is used to ‘servo-out’ the non-linearity of the diodes D1, D2.  
 When D1 conducts, a clamped version of the input signal appears at the junction of R6 
and D1 and a unity-gain but phase-inverted path is established through R4; the overall gain 
suddenly drops to zero as the two signals are cancelled at the summing point of A3, so the 
output cannot move any further and is clipped. The precision rectifier A3 acts in the same 
way for positive inputs. 
 Since A1 and A3 are never active at the same time, they can share the resistor R4, which makes 
for a very elegant circuit. The downside of this economy is that the active precision rectifier 
has to also drive the feedback resistance (R6 or R8) of the inactive precision rectifier, its other 
end being connected to virtual ground, and this will use up slightly more power. From this 
point of view the saving of a resistor is not quite as elegant as it looks; if power economy is 
paramount then separate cancellation resistors to each precision rectifier remove the problem.  
 As  Figure 24.31 demonstrates, this circuit is a success. There is now no measurable 
distortion, even just below the clipping threshold (the step around 20 kHz is an artefact 
of the testgear used). The reason for this is that there are no opamp loading issues and no 
reverse-biased diodes with signal on one side connected to the audio path on the other 
side. The two clamp stages have zero output until the threshold is reached, with R4 being 
connected only to a virtual ground.

Level control and special circuits 703
 With perfectly accurate resistors, and indeed perfect opamps, this circuit would give complete 
cancellation and the top of the clipped waveform would be absolutely flat. Cancellation 
processes have something of a dubious reputation in engineering circles, because of the need 
for accurate matching of amplitude and phase to get a good cancellation. Where this depends 
on several factors – and particularly if semiconductor characteristics enter the equation – it 
can indeed be difficult to control. However, in this particular case the cancellation accuracy 
depends only on a few well-matched resistors. 1% tolerance is quite good enough, and 
most modern resistors are this accurate. The only consequence of mismatching is a very 
slight curvature of the clipped part of the waveform, and this is not normally enough to be 
troublesome. 
 As shown by the phase spikes in the diagram, this circuit gives a phase inversion, and this 
must be taken into account during the system design. 
 Noise generators 
 As with the introduction of deliberate clipping, it may seem perverse to go to a lot of 
trouble to generate noise when we have spent great efforts so far to minimise it. However, 
noise sources have their uses, for example in loudspeaker testing, room equalisation, and in 
analogue synthesisers. Noise comes, as is well known, in various colours. This is not due to 
synaesthesia (‘Tuesdays are red!’) but a convenient way of describing the spectral content of 
various particularly useful kinds of noise. 
 White noise has equal power in equal bandwidth, so there is the same power between 100 
and 200 Hz as there is between 1100 and 1200 Hz. It is the type of noise produced by most 
electronic noise mechanisms. 
 Pink noise has equal power in equal ratios of bandwidth, so there is the same power between 
100 and 200 Hz as there is between 200 and 400 Hz. The energy per Hz falls at 3 dB per 
octave as frequency increases. Pink noise is very important as it gives a flat response when 
viewed on a third-octave or other constant percentage bandwidth spectrum analyzer. 
 Red noise has its energy per Hz falling at 6 dB per octave; its main use is in synthesisers. 
There is more on noise of different colours in  Chapter 1 . 
 Most noise generators these days are digital, using maximal-length sequences to produce 
noise that is tightly defined in amplitude and spectral content. That, however, is rather outside 
the province of this analogue book, so instead we will take a quick look at analogue noise 
generation. 
 The most popular method is to use the white noise produced when a bipolar transistor is 
reverse-biased and allowed to work as a Zener diode, as shown in  Figure 24.32 . This does the 
transistor no harm, so long as the current through it is limited, and is surprisingly consistent, 

704 Chapter 24
when you consider that this is not exactly the official way to use a transistor. I took a 
collection of ten BC184C transistors of varying pedigree and provenance, and found that with 
an emitter current of 36 μA the noise output varied between 61.5 dBu and 65.6 dBu, with 
one outlier at 56.9 dBu (bandwidth 22 Hz–22 kHz). The Zener voltage was between 7.7 V 
and 8.9 V. When I tried a real Zener diode, of 6V2 voltage, the noise output was much less, 
around 85 dBu. This is presumably because Zeners are designed to produce minimal noise, 
though they still generate much more than simple silicon diodes; noise is distinctly unwanted 
in voltage reference applications. 
 The transistor noise output is well below a millivolt, and a good deal of amplification is 
needed to get it up to a useful level.  Figure 24.32 shows a humble TL072 performing this 
service; there is of course absolutely no point in using a low noise opamp such as the 5532, 
and the low bias currents of the TL072 mean that high-value resistors can be used without 
DC offset troubles. Each stage has a gain of 27 dB. A point to remember is that the TL072 
has limited open-loop bandwidth compared with more modern opamps, and if you try to take 
too much gain in one stage this will lead to a high-frequency roll-off. The last amplifier stage 
must not be allowed to clip as this will modify the energy spectrum. The output here is about 
400 mVrms so clipping will statistically be very rare. Remember there was a 4 dB variation 
in noise output for different transistor samples, and a preset gain trim may be needed for 
some applications.  
 Pinkening ﬁ lters 
 Converting white noise into the much more useful pink noise is proverbially difficult because 
you can't make a filter with a true 3 dB/octave slope, as filter slopes come in multiples 
of 6 dB/octave only. The only solution when you need a pinkening filter is a series of 
 Figure 24.32 : A white noise generator using a bipolar transistor as a Zener diode 

Level control and special circuits 705
overlapping low-pass and high-pass time-constants (i.e. alternate poles and zeros) that 
approximate to the required slope. The more pairs of poles and zeros used, the more 
accurately the response approximates to a 3 dB/octave slope. Two possible versions are 
shown in  Figure 24.33 : that in a) uses three pole-zero pairs, with a final unmatched pole 
introduced by C4; that in b) has four pole-zero pairs, with a final unmatched pole. The closer 
the pole-zero spacing, the less the wobble on the frequency response.  
 The response of 24.33b, the more expensive and more accurate version, is shown in  Figure 24.34 . 
The measured curve is seen to be closely parallel to the 3 dB/octave line drawn below 
it on the graph. A still more accurate 3 dB/octave filter can be made by using seven 
RC networks that fit in with the E6 capacitor series; accuracy is within 0.1 dB over a 
10 Hz–20 kHz frequency range. For this and more on pinkening filters, see my book  The 
Design of Active Crossovers [10].  
 Red noise is rarely required, but if needed it can be made from white noise by passing it 
through a simple integrator, which has the necessary 6 dB/octave slope.

 Power supplies 
 We thought, because we had power, we had wisdom. 
 Stephen Vincent Benet: Litany for Dictatorships, 1935 
 Opamp supply rail voltages 
 It has been mentioned several times in the earlier chapters of this book that running opamps 
at the slightly higher voltage of ±17 V rather than ±15 V gives an increase in headroom and 
dynamic range of 1.1 dB for virtually no cost and with no reliability penalty. Soundcraft ran 
all the opamps in their mixing consoles at ±17 V for at least two decades, and opamp failures 
were almost unknown. This recommendation assumes that the opamps concerned have a 
maximum supply voltage rating of ±18 V, which is the case for the Texas TL072, the new 
LM4562, and many other types. 
 The 5532 is (as usual) in a class of its own. Both the Texas and Fairchild versions of the 
NE5532 have an absolute maximum power supply voltage rating of ±22 V (though Texas 
also gives a ‘recommended supply voltage’ of ±15 V), but I have never met any attempt to 
make use of this capability. The 5532 runs pretty warm on ±17 V when it is simply quiescent, 
and my view (and that of almost all the designers I have spoken to) is that running it at any 
higher voltage is simply asking for trouble. This is a particular concern in the design of 
mixing consoles, which may contain thousands of opamps – anything that impairs their 
reliability is going to cause a  lot of trouble. In any case, moving from ±17 V rails to ±18 V 
rails only gives 0.5 dB more headroom. Stretching things to ±20 V would give 1.4 dB more 
than ±17 V, and running on the ragged edge at ±22 V would yield a more significant 2.2 dB 
more than ±17 V, but you really wouldn’t want to do it. Pushing the envelope like this is also 
going to cause difficulties if you want to run opamps with maximum supply ratings of ±18 V 
from the same power supply. 
 We will therefore concentrate here on ±17 V supplies for opamps, dealing first with 
what might be called ‘small power supplies’ i.e. those that can be conveniently built with 
TO-220 regulators. This usually means an output current capability that does not exceed 
1.5 amps, which is plenty for even complicated preamplifiers, electronic crossovers, etc, 

708 Chapter 25
but will only run a rather small mixing console; the needs of large consoles are dealt with 
later in this chapter. 
 An important question is: how low does the noise and ripple on the supply output rails need 
to be? Opamps in general have very good power supply rejection ratios (PSRR) and some 
manufacturer’s specs are given in  Table 25.1 .
 The PSRR performance is actually rather more complex than the bare figures given in the 
table imply; PSRR is typically frequency-dependent (deteriorating as frequency rises) and 
different for the V and V supply pins. It is however rarely necessary to get involved 
in this degree of detail. Fortunately even the cheapest IC regulators (such as the venerable 
78xx/79xx series) have low enough noise and ripple outputs that opamp PSRR performance 
is rarely an issue. 
 There is however another point to ponder; if you have a number of electrolytic-sized 
decoupling capacitors between rail and ground, enough noise and ripple can be coupled 
into the non-zero ground resistance to degrade the noise floor. Intelligent placing of the 
decouplers can help – putting them near where the ground and supply rails come onto the 
PCB means that ripple will go straight back to the power supply without flowing through the 
ground tracks on the rest of the PCB. This is of limited effectiveness if you have a number 
of PCBs connected to the same IDC cable, as in many small mixing desks, and in such cases 
low-ripple power supplies may be essential. 
 Apart from the opamp supply rails, audio electronics may require additional supplies, as 
shown in  Table 25.2.

 It is often convenient to power relays from a 9 V unregulated supply that also feeds the 
5 V microcontroller regulator – see later in this chapter. The use of 24 V to power LED 
metering systems is dealt with in  Chapter 23 on metering, and 48 V phantom supplies are 
examined at the end of this chapter. 
 Designing a ±15 V supply 
 Making a straightforward ±15 V 1 amp supply for an opamp-based system is very simple, 
and has been ever since the LM7815/7915 IC regulators were introduced (which was a long 
time ago). They are robust and inexpensive parts with both overcurrent and over-temperature 
protection, and give low enough output noise for most purposes. We will look quickly at the 
basic circuit because it brings out a few design points which apply equally to more complex 
variations on the theme.  Figure 25.1 shows the schematic, with typical component values; a 
centre-tapped transformer, a bridge rectifier, and two reservoir capacitors C1, C2 provide the 
unregulated rails that feed the IC regulators. The secondary fuses must be of the slow-blow type. 
The small capacitors C7–C9 across the input to the bridge reduce RF emissions from the rectifier 
diodes; they are shown as X-cap types not because they have to withstand 230 Vrms, but to 
underline the need for them to be rated to withstand continuous AC stress. The capacitors C3, C4 
are to ensure HF stability of the regulators, which like a low AC impedance at their input pins, 
but these are only required if the reservoir capacitors are not adjacent to the regulators, i.e. more 
than 10 cm away. C5, C6 are not required for regulator stability with the 78/79 series – they are 
there simply to reduce the supply output impedance at high audio frequencies. 
 There are really only two electrical design decisions to be made; the AC voltage of the 
transformer secondary and the size of the reservoir capacitors. As to the first, you must 
make sure that the unregulated supply is high enough to prevent the rails dropping out (i.e. 
letting hum through) when a low mains voltage is encountered, but not so high that either the 
Figure 25.1: A straightforward ±15 V power supply using IC regulators

710 Chapter 25
maximum input voltage of the regulator is exceeded, or it suffers excessive heat dissipation. 
How low a mains voltage it is prudent to cater for depends somewhat on where you think 
your equipment is going to be used, as some parts of the world are more subject to brown-
outs than others. You must consider both the minimum voltage-drop across the regulators 
(typically 2 V) and the ripple amplitude on the reservoirs, as it is in the ripple troughs that the 
regulator will first ‘drop out’ and let through unpleasantness at 100 Hz. 
 In general, the RMS value of the transformer secondary will be roughly equal to the DC 
output voltage.  
 The size of reservoir capacitor required depends on the amount of current that will be 
drawn from the supply. The peak-to-peak ripple amplitude is normally in the region of 
1 to 2 volts; more ripple than this reduces efficiency as the unregulated voltage has to be 
increased to allow for unduly low ripple troughs, and less ripple is usually unnecessary and 
gives excessive reservoir capacitor size and cost. The amount of ripple can be estimated with 
adequate accuracy by using Equation 25.1 
 
Vpk-pk  
t
I
C
Δ

 1000 
(Equation 25.1)
 where Vpk-pk is the peak-to-peak ripple voltage on the reservoir capacitor, I is the maximum 
current drawn from that supply rail in amps, Δt is the length of the capacitor discharge time, 
taken as 7 milliseconds, C is the size of the reservoir capacitor in microFarads. The ‘1000’ 
factor simply gets the decimal point in the right place. 
 Note that the discharge time is strictly a rough estimate, and assumes that the reservoir is 
being charged via the bridge for 3 msec, and then discharged by the load for 7 msec. Rough 
estimate it may be, but I have always found it works very well. 
 The regulators must be given adequate heatsinking. The maximum voltage drop across each 
regulator (assuming 10% high mains) is multiplied by the maximum output current to get the 
regulator dissipation in watts, and a heat sink selected with a suitable thermal resistance to 
ambient (in °C per watt) to ensure that the regulator package temperature does not exceed, 
say, 90 °C. Remember to include the temperature drop across the thermal washer between 
regulator and heatsink.  
 Under some circumstances it is wise to add protective diodes to the regulator circuitry, as 
shown in  Figure 25.2. The diodes D1, D3 across the regulators are reverse-biased in normal 
operation, but if the power supply is driving a load with a large amount of capacitance, 
it is possible for the output to remain higher in voltage than the regulator input as the 
reservoir voltage decays. D1, D3 prevent this effect from putting a reverse voltage across the 
regulators. Such diodes are not usually required with normal opamp circuitry, as the amount 
of rail decoupling, shown as C7, C8 in  Figure 25.2 , is usually modest. 

Power supplies 711
 The shunt protection diodes D2, D4 are once again reverse-biased in normal operation. D2 
prevents the 15 V supply rail from being dragged below 0 V if the 15 V rail starts up 
slightly faster, and likewise D4 protects the 15 V regulator from having its output pulled 
above 0 V. This can be an important issue if rail-to-rail decoupling such as C9 is in use; such 
decoupling can be useful because it establishes a low AC impedance across the supply rails 
without coupling supply rail noise into the ground, as C7, C8 are prone to do. However, it 
also makes a low-impedance connection between the two regulators. D2, D4 will prevent 
damage in this case, but leave the power supply vulnerable to start-up problems; if its output 
is being pulled down by the 15 V regulator, the 15 V regulator may refuse to start. This is 
actually a very dangerous situation, because it is quite easy to come up with a circuit where 
start-up will only fail one time in 20 or more, the incidence being apparently completely 
random, but presumably controlled by the exact point in the AC mains cycle where the 
supply is switched on and other variables such as temperature, the residual charge left on 
the reservoir capacitors, and the phase of the moon. If even one start-up failure event is 
overlooked or dismissed as unimportant, then there is likely to be serious grief further down 
the line.  Every power supply start-up failure must be taken seriously. 
 Designing a ±17 V supply 
 There are 15 V IC regulators (7815, 7915) and there are 18 V IC regulators, (7818, 7918) 
but there are no 17 V IC regulators. This problem can be effectively solved by using 15 V 
regulators and adding 2 volts to their output by manipulating the voltage at the REF pin. 
The simplest way to do this is with a pair of resistors that divide down the regulated output 
voltage and apply it to the REF pin as shown in  Figure 25.3a (the transformer and AC input 
Figure 25.2: Adding protection diodes to a ±15 V power supply. The load has decoupling capacitors 
to both ground (C7, C8) and between the rails (C9); the latter can cause start-up problems

Figure 25.3: Making a ±17 V power supply with 15 V IC regulators: a) using resistors is inefﬁ cient 
and/or inaccurate, b) adding transistors to the voltage  determining resistor network makes the 
output voltage more predictable and reduces the power consumed in the resistors

Power supplies 713
components have been omitted in this and the following diagrams, except where they differ 
from those shown above). Since the regulator maintains 15 V between the OUT and REF pin, 
with suitable resistor values the actual output with respect to 0 V is 17 V. 
 The snag with this arrangement is that the quiescent current that flows out of the REF pin to 
ground is not well controlled; it can vary between 5 and 8 mA, depending on both the input 
voltage and the device temperature. This means that R1 and R2 have to be fairly low in value 
so that this variable current does not cause excessive variation of the output voltage, and 
therefore power is wasted.  
 If a transistor is added to the circuit as in  Figure 25.3b , then the impedance seen by the REF 
pin is much lower. This means that the values of R1 and R2 can be increased by an order of 
magnitude, reducing the waste of regulator output current and reducing the heat liberated. 
This sort of manoeuvre is also very useful if you find that you have a hundred thousand 15 V 
regulators in store, but what you actually need for the next project is an 18 V regulator, of 
which you have none. 
 What about the output ripple with this approach? I have just measured a power supply using 
the exact circuit of   Figure 25.3b , with 2200 μF reservoirs, and I found 79 dBu (87 μVrms) 
on the 17 V output rail, and 74 dBu (155 μVrms) on the 17 V rail, which is satisfyingly 
low for inexpensive regulators, and should be adequate for almost all purposes; note that 
these figures include regulator noise as well as ripple. The load current was 110 mA. If you 
 are plagued by ripple troubles, the usual reason is a rail decoupling capacitor that is belying 
its name by coupling rail ripple into a sensitive part of the ground system and the cure is 
to correct the grounding rather than design an expensive ultra-low ripple PSU. Note that 
doubling the reservoir capacitance to 4400 μF only improved the figures to 80 dBu and 
76 dBu respectively; just increasing reservoir size is not a cost-effective way to reduce the 
output ripple. 
 Using variable-voltage regulators 
 It is of course also possible to make a ±17 V supply by using variable output voltage IC 
regulators such as the LM317/337. These maintain a small voltage (usually 1.2 V) between 
the OUTPUT and ADJ (shown in figures as GND) pins, and are used with a resistor divider 
to set the output voltage. The quiescent current flowing out of the ADJ pin is a couple of 
orders of magnitude lower than for the 78/79 series, at around 55 μA, and so a simple resistor 
divider gives adequate accuracy of the output voltage, and transistors are no longer needed to 
absorb the quiescent current. A disadvantage is that this more sophisticated kind of regulator 
is somewhat more expensive than the 78/79 series; at the time of writing they cost something 
like 50% more. The 78/79 series with transistor voltage-setting remains the most cost-
effective way to make a non-standard-voltage power supply at the time of writing.  

714 Chapter 25
 It is clear from  Figure 25.4 that the 1.2 V reference voltage between ADJ and out is amplified 
by many times in the process of making a 17 V or 18 V supply; this not only increases output 
ripple, but also output noise as the noise from the internal reference is being amplified. The 
noise and ripple can be considerably reduced by putting a capacitor C7 between the ADJ pin 
and ground. This makes a dramatic difference; in a test PSU with a 650 mA load the output 
noise and ripple was reduced from 63 dBu (worse than 78xx series) to 86 dBu (better 
than 78xx series) and so such a capacitor is usually fitted as standard. If it is fitted, it is 
then essential to add a protective diode D1 to discharge C7, C8 safely if the output is short-
circuited, as shown in  Figure 25.5. 
Figure 25.4: Making a ±17 V power supply with variable-voltage IC regulators
Figure 25.5: Ripple improvement and protective diodes for a variable-voltage IC regulator

Power supplies 715
 The ripple performance of the aforementioned test PSU, with a 6800 μF reservoir 
capacitor and a 650 mA load, is summarised for both types of regulator in  Table 25.3.  
Note that the exact ripple figures are subject to some variation between regulator 
specimens. 
 Improving ripple performance 
 Table 25.3 shows that the best noise and ripple performance that can be expected from 
a simple LM317 regulator circuit is about 86 dBu (39 μVrms) and this still contains a 
substantial ripple component. The reservoir capacitors are already quite large at 4700 μF, 
so what is to be done if lower ripple levels are needed? The options are: 
1.  Look for a higher-performance IC regulator. They will cost more and there are likely to 
be issues with single sourcing. 
2.  Design your own high-performance regulator using discrete transistors or opamps. This 
is not a straightforward business if all the protection that IC regulators have is to be 
included. There can also be distressing issues with HF stability. 
3.  Add an RC input filter between the reservoir capacitor and the regulator. This is simple 
and pretty much bullet-proof, and preserves all the protection features of the IC regulator, 
though the extra components are a bit bulky and not that cheap. There is some loss of 
efficiency due to the voltage drop across the series resistor; this has to be kept low and 
the capacitance large. 
 The lower two rows of  Table 25.3 show what happens. In the first case the filter values 
were 2.2 Ω and 2200 μF. This has a 3 dB frequency of 33 Hz and attenuates the 100 Hz 
ripple component by 10 dB. This has a fairly dramatic effect on the output ripple, but the dB 
figures do not change that much as the input filter does not affect the noise generated inside 
the regulator. Increasing the filter capacitance to 4400 μF sinks the ripple below the noise 
level for both types of regulator.

716 Chapter 25
 Dual supplies from a single winding 
 It is extremely convenient to use third-party ‘wall-wart’ power supplies for small pieces of 
equipment, as they come with all the safety and EMC approvals already done for you, though 
admittedly they do not look appropriate with high-end equipment. 
 The problem is that the vast majority of these supplies give a single AC voltage on a two-pole 
connector, so a little thought is required to derive two supply rails.  Figure 25.6 shows how it 
is done in a ±18 V power supply; note that these voltages are suitable only for a system that 
uses 5532s throughout. Two voltage-doublers of opposite polarity are used to generate the two 
unregulated voltages. When the incoming voltage goes negative, D3 conducts and the positive 
end of C1 takes up approximately 0 V. When the incoming voltage swings positive, D1 conducts 
instead and the charge on C1 is transferred to C3. Thus the whole peak-to-peak voltage of the 
AC supply appears across reservoir capacitor C3. In the same way, the peak-to-peak voltage, 
but with the opposite polarity, appears across reservoir C4. 
 Since voltage-doublers use half-wave rectification, they are not suitable for high current 
supplies. When choosing the value of the reservoir capacitor values, bear in mind that the 
discharge time in Equation 25.1 above must be changed from 7 msec to 17 msec. The input 
capacitors C1, C2 should be the same size as the reservoirs.  
 Power supplies for discrete circuitry 
 One of the main reasons for using discrete audio electronics is the possibility of handling 
larger signals than can be coped with by opamps running off ±17 V rails. The use of ±24 V 
rails allows a 3 dB increase in headroom, which is probably about the minimum that justifies 
the extra complications of discrete circuitry. A ±24 V supply can be easily implemented with 
7824/7924 IC regulators. 
Figure 25.6: A ±18 V power supply powered by a single transformer winding

Power supplies 717
 A slightly different approach was used in my first published preamplifier design [1]. This 
preamp in fact used two LM7824  24 V regulators connected as shown in  Figure 25.7 
because at the time the LM7924 24 V regulator had not yet reached the market. The use 
of a second positive regulator to produce the negative output rail looks a little strange at first 
sight but I can promise you it works. It can be very useful in the sort of situation described 
above; you have a hundred thousand 15 V regulators in store, but no 15 V regulators . . . 
I’m sure you see the point.  
 Note that this configuration requires two separate transformer windings; it cannot be used 
with a centre-tapped secondary. 
 Larger power supplies 
 So what if you need more than 1 amp of current? This will certainly be the case for all but the 
smallest mixing consoles. There are of course IC regulators with a greater current capability 
than 1 Amp. The LM338K variable-voltage 5 amp regulators come in a TO-3 package – 
which it has to be said is not the easiest format to mount. They were once widely used in 
mixing console power supplies but have been superseded by more modern devices such as 
the Linear Tech LT1083CK, which is a 7.5 amp variable-voltage regulator that works very 
nicely, and can be obtained in a TO-3P package. I have used lots of them in mixing console 
power supplies. An example of their use, incorporating a mutual-shutdown facility, is shown 
in  Figure 25.8.  
Figure 25.7: A ±24 V power supply using only positive regulators

718 Chapter 25
 There is no negative version of the LT1083CK, so a ± supply has to be made with two 
separate secondary windings, just as in  Figure 25.7. When using any high-current regulator it 
pays to be rather cautious about the maximum rated current. Trying to use them too close to 
the maximum can cause start-up problems. 
 Mutual shutdown circuitry 
 It is an awkward quirk of 5532 opamps that if one supply rail is lost and collapses to 0 V, 
while the other rail remains at the normal voltage, they can under some circumstances get 
into an anomalous mode of operation that draws large supply currents and ultimately destroys 
the opamp by over-heating. To prevent damage from this cause, which could be devastating 
to a large mixing console, the opamp supplies are very often fitted with a mutual shutdown 
system. Mutual shutdown ensures that if one supply rail collapses, because of overcurrent, 
over-temperature or any other cause, the other rail will be promptly switched off. The extra 
circuitry required to implement this is shown in  Figure 25.8 , which is an example of a high-
current supply using 7.5 amp regulators. 
 The extra circuitry to implement mutual-shutdown in  Figure 25.8 is very simple; R5, D3, 
R6 and Q1 and Q2. Because R5 is equal to R6, D3 normally sits at around 0 V in normal 
operation. If the 17 V rail collapses, Q2 is turned on by R6, and the REF pin of U2 is pulled 
down to the bottom rail, reducing the output to the reference voltage (1.25 V). This is not 
completely off, but it is low enough to prevent any damage to opamps. 
Figure 25.8: A high-current ±17 V power supply with mutual shutdown circuitry

Power supplies 719
 If the 17 V rail collapses, Q1 is turned on by R5, pulling down the REF pin of U1 in the 
same way. Q1 and Q2 do not operate exactly symmetrically, but it is close enough for our 
purposes. 
 Note that this circuit can only be used with variable output voltage regulators, because it 
relies on their low reference voltages. 
 Very large power supplies 
 By ‘very large’ I mean too big to be implemented with IC regulators – say 7 amps and above. 
This presents a difficult problem, to which there are several possible answers: 
1.  Split up the system supply rails so that several IC regulators can be used. This is in my 
view the best approach. The amount of design work is relatively small; in particular the 
short-circuit protection has been done for you. 
2.  Use power transistors as series-pass elements, controlled by opamps. This can be a 
surprisingly tricky technology. The feedback system has to be reliably stable, and the 
short-circuit protection has to be foolproof. Designing the latter is not too simple. 
3.  Switch-mode power supplies. Those found in PCs seem to be a mature technology, and are 
very reliable. Custom designs, of the sort required for this application are, in my experience, 
another matter. I have seen them explode. There is also the issue of RF emissions. 
 The first two methods obviously involve increased heat dissipation in proportion to their 
output current. This usually means that fan cooling is required to keep the heatsinks down to 
a reasonable size, which is fine for PA work but not welcome in a studio control room. There 
are no great technical difficulties to powering even a large console over a 20-metre cable 
(this is the recommended maximum for Neve consoles) so long as remote sensing is used to 
compensate for voltage drops. 20 metres is usually long enough to allow the power supply to 
be placed in another room. 
 The technology of very large audio supplies is a specialised and complicated business, and it 
would not be appropriate to dig any further into it here. 
 Microcontroller and relay supplies 
 It is very often most economical to power relays from an unregulated supply. This is 
perfectly practical as relays have a wide operating voltage range. If 9 V relays are used then 
the same unregulated supply can feed a 5 V regulator to power a microcontroller, as shown 
in   Figure 25.9   .

720 Chapter 25
 Hum induced by electrostatic coupling from an unregulated relay supply rail can be sufficient 
to compromise the noise floor; the likelihood of this depends on the physical layout, but 
inevitably the signal paths and the relay supply come into proximity at the relay itself. It is 
therefore necessary to give this rail some degree of smoothing, without going to the expense 
of another regulator and heatsink (there must be no possibility of coupling between signal 
ground and relay power ground; these must only join right back at the power supply). This 
method of powering relays is more efficient than a regulated rail as it does not require a 
voltage drop across a regulator that must be sufficient to prevent drop-out and consequent rail 
ripple at low mains voltages. 
 Simple RC smoothing works perfectly well for this purpose. Relays draw relatively high 
currents, so a low R and a high value C are used to minimise voltage losses in R and changes 
in the relay supply voltage as different numbers of relays are energised. 
 The RC smoothing values shown in  Figure 25.9 are typical, but are likely to need adjustment 
depending on how many relays are powered and how much current they draw. R1 is low at 2.2 Ω 
and C2 high at 4700 μF; fortunately the voltage is low so C2 need not be physically large. 
 48 V phantom power supplies 
 Making a discrete 48 V regulator with the necessary low amounts of noise and ripple is 
not too hard, but making one that is reliably short-circuit proof is a little more of a challenge, 
and by far the easiest way to design a 48 V phantom supply is to use a special high-voltage 
regulator called the TL783C, as shown in  Figure 25.10 . This extremely handy device can 
supply 700 mA, subject to power dissipation constraints.  
 It is a variable-voltage device, maintaining typically 1.27 V between the OUT and 
ADJ pins. It combines BJT circuitry with high-voltage MOS devices on the same chip, 
Figure 25.9: A 5 V PSU with an RC smoothed 9 V relay supply

Power supplies 721
allowing it to withstand much higher voltages than standard bipolar regulators. Since 
MOS devices are not subject to secondary-breakdown or thermal-runaway, the TL783 still 
gives full overload protection while operating with up to a 125 V voltage drop from the 
input to the output. The TL783 has current limiting, safe-operating-area (SOA) protection, 
and thermal shutdown. Even if the ADJ pin is accidentally disconnected, the protection 
circuitry stays operational. It is a very useful and reliable IC, and I have deployed 
thousands of them. 
 As with other variable-voltage regulators, the low voltage maintained between the OUT and 
ADJ pins needs to be amplified by a considerable ratio to get the desired output voltage, and 
so the reference voltage tolerances are also amplified. In this case the amplification factor is 
as high as 37 times, and so a preset is used to adjust the output voltage to exactly 48 V. The 
filter capacitor C3 is essential for the same reason – without it the ripple is amplified along 
with the reference voltage. 
 The unregulated supply can be derived from a completely separate transformer secondary 
as in  Figure 25.10 , or alternatively by means of a voltage doubler. The latter is usually more 
economic, but obviously this depends on the cost of an extra transformer winding versus the 
cost of the extra capacitor in the doubler.  
 The arrangement of a voltage-doubler phantom supply is shown in  Figure 25.11. Note that 
the familiar voltage doubler circuit C13, C2, D5, D6 is actually working as a voltage-tripler, 
because it is perched on the unregulated 23 V supply to the 17 V regulator. If it worked 
as a true voltage-doubler, based on the 0 V rail, it would generate insufficient unregulated 
voltage for the phantom regulator. Because of their inherently half-wave operation and 
relatively poor regulation, voltage-doubler or voltage-tripler methods are not suitable for 
high-current phantom supplies.

reference multiplication factor, a preset is required to set the output voltage exactly

 Interfacing with the digital domain 
 Introduction 
 The advance of digital audio has greatly improved the fidelity of audio storage media, and 
generally made wonderful things possible, but sound waves remain stubbornly analogue, and 
so conversion from analogue to digital and vice-versa is very necessary. Today’s analogue 
to digital converters (ADCs) and digital to analogue converters (DACs) have excellent 
performance, with 24-bit accuracy at a 192 kHz sampling rate a commonplace, but to achieve 
this potential performance in an application there are a good number of factors that need to 
be appreciated. Some of them, such as the need for effective HF decoupling, are relatively 
straightforward providing you follow the manufacturer’s recommendations; but others, 
involving the actual interfacing to the analogue input and output pins, are a bit more subtle. 
 Having said that, contemporary ADCs and DACs are far easier to apply than their ancestors. 
Oversampling technology means that it is no longer necessary to put a ninth-order brickwall 
low-pass anti-aliasing filter in front of an ADC, or place a ninth-order brickwall low-pass 
reconstruction filter after a DAC. If you’ve ever tried to design a ninth-order filter to a price, 
you will know that this is a very significant freedom. It has had a major effect in reducing 
the price of digital equipment, particularly in applications like digital mixers where a large 
number of ADCs and DACs are required. 
 ADC and DAC technology moves rapidly; the device examples I have chosen here will 
probably soon be out of date. The general principles I give should be more enduring, and 
will be valid for the foreseeable development of the technologies. 
 PCB layout considerations 
 The PCB layout for both ADCs and DACs requires observance of certain precautions, which 
are basically the same for both functions. A double-sided PCB is necessary not only because 
of the large number of connections that have to be made in a small space, but also because 
it allows tracks that need to be isolated from each other to be put on opposite sides of the 
board. A most important consideration is to keep digital signals, particularly fast ones such 
as clocks, out of the analogue inputs, so use as much physical spacing between these as 

724 Chapter 26
possible. Critical tracks on opposite sides of the board should be run at right angles to each 
other to minimise coupling through the PCB. Do not run digital tracks topside under the IC 
as they may couple noise directly into the die from underneath. 
 Separate analogue and digital ground planes should be used. Most conversion ICs have their 
analogue and digital interfaces at opposite ends or opposite sides of the package, facilitating 
the use of separate ground planes. It is usually best to run the analogue ground plane under 
the IC to minimise the coupling of digital noise. The two ground planes must of course be 
connected together at some point, and this should be implemented by a single junction close 
to the IC. Some manufacturers (e.g. Analog Devices) recommend that the junction should be 
made through a ferrite bead to filter out high RF frequencies. A maximum-copper (minimum-
etch) PCB layout technique is generally the best for ground planes as it gives the most 
screening possible. 
 The power supply tracks to the IC should be as wide as possible to give low impedance paths 
and reduce the voltage effects of current glitches on the power supply lines. Ideally a four-
layer PCB (and such boards are now cheaper than they have ever been) should be used so that 
two layers can be devoted to power supply planes. 
 Thorough decoupling is always important when using high speed devices such as ADCs 
and DACs. All analogue and digital supplies should be decoupled to analogue ground and 
digital ground respectively, using 0.1 μF ceramic capacitors in parallel with 10 μF electrolytic 
capacitors. Some manufacturers recommend using tantalum capacitors for this. To achieve 
the best possible decoupling, the capacitors should be placed as physically close to the IC 
as possible and solidly connected to the relevant ground plane. 
 When you are designing ADCs or DACs into a system, my experience is that significant 
time can be saved by doing preliminary testing on manufacturer’s evaluation boards; this 
has particular force when you are using parts from a range you have not used before. Higher 
authority may urge you to go straight to a PCB layout, but unless you are very sure what you 
are doing – if for example, you are cut-and-pasting from an existing satisfactory design – it is a 
relatively high-risk approach. Evaluation boards are usually expensive, as they are produced 
in small quantities, but in my view it is money very well spent. 
 Nominal levels and ADCs 
 The best use of the dynamic range of an ADC is only possible if it is presented with a signal 
of roughly the right amplitude. Too low a level degrades the signal-to-noise ratio as the 
top bits are not used, and too high a level will not only cause unpleasant-sounding digital 
clipping, but can cause damage to the ADC if current flows are not limited. Analogue 
circuitry is therefore needed to scale the signal to the right amplitude. 

 Interfacing with digital 725
 A typical application of ADCs is in digital mixing consoles. These must accept both 
microphone and line input levels. Since the signal level from a microphone may be very 
low (lute music) or very high (microphone in the kick-drum), an input amplifier with a 
wide variable gain range is required, typically 70 dB and sometimes as much as 80 dB. 
The signal level range of line signals is less but still requires a gain range of some 30 dB 
to cope with all conditions. It is therefore necessary for the operator to adjust the input 
gain, by reference to a level meter, so that good use is made of the available dynamic 
range without risking clipping. In live situations with unpredictable levels this is always 
something of a judgement call. 
 The signal level required at the ADC input to give maximum output, which is usually referred 
to as full-scale (FS) varies from manufacturer to manufacturer; this important point is brought 
out in the next section. 
 Some typical ADCs 
 There are a large number of ADCs on the market, and it is necessary to pick out just 
a few to look at. You will note that the various parts are actually very similar in their 
application. The inclusion of a device here does not mean that I am giving it any personal 
recommendation. All the devices mentioned are capable of 24-bit 192 kHz operation. In 
some cases the input voltage required for FS appears to exceed the supply voltage; this is 
not so, the quoted peak-to-peak voltage is the difference between two differential input 
pins. And now in alphabetical order: 
 The Analog Devices AD1871 is a stereo audio ADC with two 24-bit conversion channels 
each giving 105 dB of dynamic range, and each having a programmable gain amplifier 
(PGA) at the front end, a multibit sigma-delta modulator, and decimation filters. The digital 
details are rather outside our scope here and will not be alluded to further. The PGA has five 
gain settings ranging from 0 dB to 12 dB in 3 dB steps. The differential input required for 
full-scale is 2.828 V pk-pk and the input impedance is 8 KΩ. Like most of its kind, the AD1871 
runs its analogue section from 5 V, but the digital section from 3.3 V to save power. This 
IC is unusual in that it is permissible to run the digital section from 5 V, which can save you 
a regulator. 
 The Analog Devices AD1974 is a quad ADC with four differential analogue inputs having 
a very useful CMRR of 55 dB (typical, at both 1 kHz and 20 kHz). These inputs are not 
buffered and require special interfacing that will be described later. A differential input of 
5.4 V pk-pk is needed for FS; the input impedance is 8 KΩ. This IC runs from 3.3 V only. 
 The Burr-Brown PCM1802 is a stereo ADC with single-ended analogue voltage inputs with 
input buffer amplifiers. It requires 3.0 V pk-pk to reach full-scale and has a resistive input 

726 Chapter 26
impedance of 20 KΩ. The analogue section is powered from 5 V, the digital section from 
3.3 V. 
 The Wolfson WM8782 is a stereo ADC with two single-ended analogue inputs with buffer 
amplifiers.  It requires 2.82 V pk-pk (1.0 Vrms) to reach FS and the input impedance is 10 KΩ. 
The analogue section is powered from 5 V and the digital core from 3.3 V. 
 Interfacing with ADC inputs 
 The issues involved in interfacing with an ADC depend very much on how the ADC input 
is configured. As we saw in the previous section, some ADCs, such as the Burr-Brown 
PCM1802 and the Wolfson WM8782 have internal buffer amplifiers that present a relatively 
high impedance to the outside world (in this case 20 KΩ and 10 KΩ respectively). These 
inputs are very straightforward to drive. Such buffers are usually only found in ADCs made 
in a bipolar or BiCMOS process as making good low-noise low-distortion amplifiers in a 
straight CMOS technology is very difficult. 
 Others, such as the AD1974, do not have buffering and must be driven from special circuitry. 
In the case of the AD1974 and similar devices, the differential inputs must be driven from 
a differential signal source to get the best performance. The basic principle is shown in 
 Figure 26.1 . The input pins connect to switched internal capacitors, and these generate 
glitches. Each input pin must be isolated from the opamp driving it by an external series 
resistor R5, R6 together with a capacitor C5, C6 connected from input to ground. This 
capacitor must not generate non-linearity when the voltage across it changes, so ceramic 
NPO or polypropylene film types must be used; recommended values for the resistors and 
capacitors are usually given in the application notes. Note that since the external opamps are 
referenced to ground, and the ADC internals are referenced to half the 5 V rail, blocking 
capacitors C2, C3 are needed. 
 Adding external resistance will slow down the charging of input sampling capacitors. These 
must be allowed to charge for many time-constants if they are to get close enough to the final 
value to avoid degrading the performance. External resistance increases the time-constant 
and can degrade accuracy; manufacturers usually provide guidance as to how much external 
resistance is permissible for a given number of bits of accuracy. 
 A point that is obvious but easily overlooked is that the inputs must not be driven to 
excessive levels. This usually means that the input voltage should not go outside the 
supply rails by more than 300 mV; for example Wolfson specify this restriction for both 
the analogue and digital inputs of the WM8782 stereo ADC, and the other manufacturers 
quote similar ratings. 

 Interfacing with digital 727
 While ADC inputs invariably have clamp diodes for ESD protection that are intended to 
prevent the inputs moving outside the supply rails, these are small-dimensioned devices 
that may be destroyed by the output current capability of an opamp. This is why the input 
voltage should not go outside the supply rails by more than 300 mV – this voltage will not 
cause a silicon diode to conduct significantly, even at elevated temperatures. The diodes can 
usually handle 5 mA, but to subject them to anything more is to live dangerously. Obviously 
the manufacturer’s absolute maximum ratings should be followed on this point, but not all 
manufacturers give a current rating for their clamp diodes. 
 Bullet-proof protection against input over-voltages is given by running the driving opamp 
from the same supply rails as the analogue section of the ADC, the opamp saturation voltages 
ensuring that the input can never reach the supply rails, never mind exceed them. This does, 
however, restrict your choice of opamp to one that is happy working on low supply voltages; 
these are likely to be more expensive than the popular audio opamps such as the 5534/5532, 
which will not give good performance from such low rails. 
 If you want to stick with the usual audio opamps, working from higher supply rails than the 
ADC, then an effective means of protection is the use of external clamping diodes, which 
 Figure 26.1 : A typical drive circuit for an unbuffered differential ADC input 

728 Chapter 26
in conjunction with a series resistance, will limit the voltage swing at the ADC input. The 
principle is shown in  Figure 26.2 ; if the opamp output exceeds 5 V then D1 will conduct, 
while if it goes negative of 0 V D2 will conduct, safely clamping the ADC input. 
 A vital point here is that the clamp diodes must be of the Schottky type, so their forward 
voltage is substantially less than that of the conventional silicon diodes on-chip, for otherwise 
they will give little or no protection. The on-chip diodes will be warmer and would conduct 
before conventional external silicon diodes. 
 R1 must be large enough to limit the current in D1, D2 to safe levels, but not so large that 
it causes a roll-off with the ADC input capacitance. It must also not be so large that the non-
linear capacitance of the diodes causes significant non-linearity; 1 KΩ should be safe in 
this respect. Note that R1 is also useful in isolating the opamp output from the ADC input 
capacitance, which can otherwise erode stability margins. 
 Some typical DACs 
 Unlike ADCs, DACs come in two different types – voltage output and current output. 
Both types of output require some kind of low-pass filtering, but current output DACs also 
need current-to-voltage (I–V) conversion stages. There are a large number of DACs on the 
market, and it is essential to be selective in examining a few typical devices. Once again, the 
 Figure 26.2 : Diode clamping circuit to prevent overdriving an ADC input. Note that the diodes 
must be Schottky types 

 Interfacing with digital 729
inclusion of a device here does not mean that I am giving it my personal recommendation. 
All the devices mentioned here are capable of 24-bit operation. And now in alphabetical 
order: 
 The Analog Devices AD1854 is a stereo audio DAC delivering 113 dB Dynamic Range 
and 112 dB SNR (A-weighted) at a 48 kHz sample rate. Maximum sample rate is 96 kHz. 
Differential analogue voltage outputs give a maximum output of 5.6 V pk-pk at full-scale and 
the output impedance is less than 200 Ω. It operates from a single 5 V supply rail, though 
there are separate supply pins for the analogue and digital sections. 
 The Texas PCM1794A is a stereo audio DAC supporting sample rates up to 192 kHz. It has 
differential analogue current outputs giving a maximum of 7.8 mA pk-pk at full-scale. The 
analogue section is powered from 5 V, the digital section from 3.3 V. 
 The Wolfson WM8740 is a stereo audio DAC supporting word lengths from 16 to 24 bits and 
sample rates up to 192 kHz. Differential analogue voltage outputs give a maximum output of 
2.82 V pk-pk at full-scale. It can operate from a single 5 V supply rail, or the digital section 
can be run from 3.3 V to reduce power consumption. 
 Interfacing with DAC outputs 
 Modern DACs use oversampling so that brickwall reconstruction filters are not necessary 
at the analogue outputs. Nonetheless, some low-pass filtering is essential to remove high-
frequency components that could cause trouble downstream from the output. 
 If you are using a DAC with a current output, the first thing you have to do is convert 
that current to a voltage. This is usually done with a shunt-feedback stage as shown in 
 Figure 26.3 , frequently called an I–V converter. The opamp most popular for this job (and 
in fact explicitly recommended for the Texas PCM1794A) is no less than our old friend the 
5534/5532. The filter capacitors C1, C2 keep down the slew rate required at the outputs of the 
I–V converters, and with their parallel resistors give a 3 dB roll-off at 88.2 kHz. The current 
output is simply scaled by the value of R1, R2 and results in a voltage output of 3.20 V peak 
for 3.9 mA peak out (half of the total 7.8 mA pk-pk FS output) and when the two anti-phase 
voltages are combined in the differential amplifier that follows the total output is 6.4 V peak 
or 4.5 Vrms. The differential amplifier has its own HF roll-off at 151 kHz to give further 
filtering, implemented by C3 and C4. The capacitors used must be linear; NP0 ceramic, 
polystyrene or polypropylene are the only types suitable. 
 Voltage output DACs are somewhat simpler to apply as there is no need for I–V converters 
and the outputs can drive an active low-pass filter directly. The output is usually differential 
to obtain enough voltage-swing capability within the limited supply voltage available, 

730 Chapter 26
so differential to single-ended conversion is still required, and this is often cunningly 
implemented in the form of a differential low-pass filter. 
 Figure 26.4 shows a typical differential low-pass filter system; it has a third-order Bessel 
characteristic with a corner frequency of 92 kHz. The outputs are combined, and the first two 
poles are implemented by the differential multiple-feedback filter around U1:A and the third 
pole is produced by the passive network R7, C5. Note that the circuitry uses E96 resistor 
values in order to obtain the desired accuracy. Multiple-feedback filters are often preferred for 
this kind of application because they do not suffer from the failure of attenuation at very high 
frequencies that afflicts Sallen and Key filters, due to the inability of the opamp to maintain a 
low impedance at its output when its open-loop gain, and hence its feedback factor, has fallen 
to a low value. 
 It must not be assumed from this that all DACs have differential outputs. For example, the 
Wolfson WM8726, described as a ‘low cost stereo DAC’ has single-ended voltage outputs; 
it is recommended they are followed by a second-order low-pass filter.

 Interfacing with microcontrollers 
 Having looked at interfacing with ADCs and DACs in digital audio, we turn to the important 
business of interfacing with microcontrollers. Much audio equipment keeps the signals 
wholly in the analogue domain, but uses a microcontroller to handle humble but essential 
housekeeping tasks such as muting relay control at power-up and power-down, and input 
select relay control. Volume control ICs keep the signal analogue but are controlled by serial 
data, generated when the microcontroller is driven from a rotary encoder connected to the 
volume knob. Input select ICs (an array of high-voltage analogue gates), such as the Toshiba 
TC9163, likewise require serial data to control them. Many pieces of equipment have remote 
controls, so a microcontroller is essential to decode the incoming RC5 data and activate the 
correct bit of circuitry. LCD displays typically also take serial data, and with a large display 
the software can get complex. The microcontroller will also take the unit out of standby when 
a 12 V trigger is received. 
 PIC devices are very popular, and the 16F72 is used as an example here. There are many 
other microcontroller families; the same basic principles apply. The 16F72 is a capable 
but inexpensive device that incorporates flash program memory, timers, serial ports, and 

732 Chapter 26
an 8-bit A/D converter, but here the three 8-bit I/O ports A, B and C are used to illustrate a 
preamplifier application. Each port pin can be separately defined to be an input or an output. 
 Figure 26.5 is not a complete system but illustrates various techniques. The PIC output ports 
can drive LEDs directly, such as D5 with resistor R2 to set the current. LEDs D1 to D4 
indicate which preamp input is selected, and since only one is ever on at a time they can share 
resistor R1. For loads such as relays that take more current than an output port can handle 
directly, a transistor Q1 can be used. Note the suppression diode across the relay coil. 
 The BA6218 control IC for the motorised volume control is driven by the two output pins 
RC4 and RC5. These are simple logic outputs and not a serial connection. See  Chapter 13 for 
more on motorised volume controls. 
 Remote control commands are demodulated and filtered by the IR receiver U3, and the serial 
data output is applied to RC6. The IR commands are then decoded by software in the PIC. 
 The B port has a useful extra option. It can be set so that each pin has a “weak-pullup” of 
250 μA to the 5 V rail; this means that switches like SW1 do not need an external pullup 
resistor. When there are a large number of switches to be read a row-and-column matrix is 
much more economical of input pins. 
 Figure 26.5 : Examples of interfacing to a PIC 16F72 microcontroller for preamp housekeeping  

 Interfacing with digital 733
 The PIC clock frequency is set by ceramic resonator CER1. These components are much 
cheaper than quartz crystals, and their 0.5% frequency tolerance (crystals show 0.001%) is 
more than good enough for setting turn-on delays and so on. 
 Input port voltages must be clamped to ensure they do not exceed the permissible limits. The 
PIC has protective clamp diodes on all pins, but these have a limited current capability, and 
if you plan to use them for clamping as opposed to just static protection, a series resistor of 
around 47 kΩ is recommended, such as R5 on the MAINS FAIL input. 
 It is an important principle of interfacing that you should not rely on a low at an output 
port to prevent, say, the mute relay from energising, perhaps by diverting the drive away 
from the base of the relay-control transistor. At power-up the output ports will be at high 
impedance. This is sometimes referred to as being ‘tri-stated’ as the high-impedance state 
is neither the high state nor the low state, but a third ‘off’ state. There may be momentary 
closure of the relay if it operates faster than the microcontroller can initialise itself and 
write a low to the output port. 
 More seriously, at power-down a mute relay must open as quickly as possible, to prevent 
thumps,  and it must stay off . The mains-fail circuitry will detect power-down and signal this 
to the microcontroller, which will write a low to the output port to open the relay. But . . . the 
output ports will go high impedance when the microcontroller supply falls. Relays have a 
wide operating voltage range, so the mute relay will close again, letting through all sorts of 
unpleasant disturbances, and will not finally open until the supply drops below the hold-on 
voltage, which may take some time. This is a much more likely scenario than misoperation 
at switch-on. 
 Avoid configuring things so that either a high or a low on an output port must be asserted to 
prevent something operating. 
 Many microcontrollers have a sleep mode which can be used to minimise the chance of 
electrical interference. I have never found it necessary to employ this in a piece of audio 
equipment; RF from the microcontroller getting into the audio has never been a problem. 
I do know of a case where it was done very successfully in an HF communications receiver, 
where the RF sensitivity is of course very much greater. Be aware that some microcontrollers 
take a surprisingly long time to come out of sleep mode. Much the same is true of me.

The Signal Transfer Company
The Signal Transfer Company supplies PCBs, kits of parts, and fully built and tested modules based on the 
design principles in this book. All designs are approved by Douglas Self.
Low Noise Balanced Input PCB
A conventional balanced input stage built with 
10K resistors and a 5532 opamp has an output 
noise level of approximately −104 dBu.
The Signal Transfer low-noise balanced 
input card uses a multiple ampliﬁ er array 
that causes the noise from each ampliﬁ er to 
partially cancel, and in a similar way improves 
the common-mode rejection ratio: this array 
is driven by a multiple-buffer structure that 
allows the input impedance to be much higher 
than usual, preventing loading of external 
equipment and also further improving the 
CMRR. This elegant design does not require 
selected or exotic components. The noise 
output is less than −115 dBu.
Balanced Output Stereo Phono Preamp
This offers both moving-magnet and 
moving-coil inputs, the latter with two gain 
options for optimal performance. It gives 
extremely accurate RIAA equalisation, a 
noise performance that approaches the 
theoretical limits, and superb linearity. It 
has fully balanced XLR outputs.
•  Exceptional RIAA accuracy of +/−0.05 dB
•  THD better than 0.002% at 6 Vrms. (Forty times 
the normal operating level)
•  3rd-order Butterworth subsonic ﬁ ller: −3 dB at 
20 Hz
•  Separate input connectors for MM and MC inputs, 
switch selected
• Power indicator LED.
We supply the ﬁ nest quality double-sided, plated-through hole, ﬁ berglass PCBs. All boards have a full solder mask, 
gold-plated pads, and a silk-screen component layout. Each PCB is supplied with extensive constructional notes, 
previously unpublished information about the design, and a detailed parts list to make ordering components simple.
Signal Transfer products include several types of power ampliﬁ er, RIAA phono preampliﬁ ers, and an enhanced version of the 
Precision Preampliﬁ er described in this book. The specialised semiconductors required for some designs are also available.
