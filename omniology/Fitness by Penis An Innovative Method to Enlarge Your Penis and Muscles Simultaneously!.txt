INTRODUCTION 
 
In this manual, you will learn to use your penis as the most effective tool 
to shape your body and also to add extra thickness and length to your 
penis. 
 
FITNESS BY PENIS is the right method that you were always looking 
for. It is designed to help you achieve a healthy and strong body along 
with even a healthier and stronger sexual drive and penis.  
 
Here is the good news to inspire and excite you to go for your dreams in 
achieving a Super Large Penis and Athletic Muscles. Both your muscles 
and penis share the same function and purpose, which is GROWING 
and ENLARGING. Therefore, your muscles and penis, due to their 
nature, would demand exercises that can help them grow thicker, longer 
and stronger. In addition, since your penis becomes erect by absorbing 
blood in its spongy chambers, it can be enlarged by increasing the 
capacity of its spongy tissues. In order to achieve a larger penis and 
stronger muscles you do not need to practice all the exercises. From the 
forty two given exercises choose the best ones that suit your body, and 
by practicing the exercises in this manual for ten to fifteen minutes a day 
you will witness the growth of your muscles and penis in a couple of 
weeks. It is important to decide which exercises are the ones you can 
perform on a daily basis and you can stick to them. For example, you 
might find out that the exercises that you can do regularly are those 
which can be done while taking your daily shower. In addition to all the 
exercises there are many tips on nutrition, mental health, penis anatomy, 
preparation, penile abuse, sex drive and erection that can help you 
achieve your goal and fulfill your dream more efficiently and quickly.  
It is a fact that without daily activity and exercises we are very likely to 
have high cholesterol, heart disease, blockage of the arteries, prostate 
and colon cancer and many other diseases that can shorten our life.  
If you are also concerned about the health, strength and the size of your 
penis, FITNESS BY PENIS is the best healthy and safe method to help 
you achieve your goal and to gain both an athletic body and a larger 
penis at the same time.

HOW TO OPTIMIZE  
PENIS AND MUSCLE ENLARGEMENT  
 
1- Your penis and muscles are parts of your body that 
share the same physical purpose and function. They are 
both optimized to achieve more strength and mass and 
eventually become larger. 
 
2- With your daily ten to fifteen minutes exercise routine, 
five days a week, you can mostly see a noticeable gain 
in both your penis and body muscles within two weeks.   
 
3- Your penis consists of three spongy chambers, which 
serve to absorb blood in order to become erect, and the 
key to have a larger penis is to expand these spongy 
tissues by given exercises in this manual. 
 
4- Apply concentration, mental visualization and deep 
breathing to your exercises in order to reduce the risk of 
injury and to achieve a better result. 
 
5- Be gentle with your penis and do the exercises 
moderately. Gentle daily exercise is a guaranteed 
procedure for a long lasting healthy workout.  
 
6- Do not force your penis to have extra tolerance under 
pressure and tension. Excess of force over your penis 
can damage its tissues and bodies, and results in longer 
period of time for achieving a larger penis.  
 
7- After each exercise or a set of exercises, take a break to 
heal and rejuvenate your muscles and tissues. Your 
penis grows through the process of cells splitting. This 
process necessitates enough time, nutrition and right 
physical and mental conditions. 
 

 
10
8- If you feel any discomfort or notice any odd 
deformations, discolorations, spots and injuries on your 
penis stop exercising until the penis is completely back 
to its normal state. 
 
9- If you do not feel safe in any exercise do not continue it 
and pick another one that suits you. 
 
10- Whenever you are sick or you feel weak do the 
exercises more moderately and in shorter time to 
prevent exhaustion in your muscles and genitals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
11
 
   HOW TO PREPARE BEFORE EACH EXERCISE 
 
1- Keep your pubic hair short to facilitate the handling of 
your penis and also to help with sanitation. 
 
2- It is always a good idea to stimulate yourself before 
daily exercises so that your testosterone level and your 
mental concentration on your genital increases, and you 
are ready for muscle development. 
 
3- Before engaging in any exercise always warm up with a 
hot water-soaked towel or warm water. Then start with 
light and moderate exercises to avoid injuries to your 
penis and muscles.  
 
4- Remember not to exercise right after ejaculation since 
your blood testosterone levels drop and all your 
connective tissues begin to tighten. 
 
5- For lubrication, avoid any oil-based, chemical and 
artificial-based lubricant such as petroleum jelly, 
Vaseline, baby oil, hand lotion or any other cleaning 
agent. Use only natural lubricants that are suitable for 
your body. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
12
ESSENTIAL FACTORS 
 
1- Eat healthy, low fat, high-fiber food and include fruits 
and vegetables in your daily diet. Eat organic food as 
much as possible. Avoid animal fat, junk foods, fast 
foods, fried foods, processed foods, caned fruits and 
foods, artificial colors and flavors, pops, artificial 
sweeteners, excess of sugar, salt and condiments, and 
above all avoid smoking, and drink alcohol in 
moderation.    
 
2- You need certain vitamins and minerals to reform, 
rebuild and expand your penis and muscles in both 
length and volume. If necessary, take a moderate 
supplement of minerals, amino acids and vitamins. 
 
3- Drink daily at least eight cups of filtered water 
(preferably ozone-treated) and pure natural fruit juices 
in total.  
 
4- Perform on a regular basis the daily given exercises. 
Daily exercises enhance your stamina, reduce your 
blood vessels’ clogs (also called atherosclerosis), 
decrease body’s total cholesterol and fat, improve blood 
circulation and make all your muscles stronger and 
healthier. They also help you maintain a good erection 
and provide you with more strength for a longer lasting 
sexual activity. 
 
5- Mental relaxation and peace of mind are among the 
most important factors to increase the ability of your 
body in developing and maintaining sexual organs and 
hormones. Avoid stress as much as you can and occupy 
yourself with activities that bring meaning to your life 
and make you feel good about yourself and your 
surrounding environment.

SYMPTOMS OF PENILE ABUSE

results in a few or many tiny bruises. They are not

Occurs when too much weight is placed on the penis for a 
long period of time; this distorts the nerves and causes them

and it is partially dead tissue covering the penis.  
 
“If you notice any symptoms stop the exercise immediately 
and discontinue until the penis is healed and the symptoms 
are gone. If after several days symptoms still persist contact 
your doctor immediately.”
