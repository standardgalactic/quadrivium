Preface
In the five years since the first edition of Google Advertising Tools was published, Google
tools for making money from content with advertising (Google AdSense) and for cre-
ating contextual advertisements (Google AdWords) have become even more important
to every business with a web presence. This software is now ubiquitous in the life of
anyone doing business on the Web. In addition, these programs and the related Google
offerings have greatly expanded in functionality and complexity.
In the first edition of Google Advertising Tools, I noted that “advertising on the Web is
a $7 billion market…with a 40 percent estimated annual growth rate.” Give or take a
few percentage points, this growth prediction has proven accurate, and the lion’s share
of it belongs to Google. But no one could have known the extent to which Google has
expanded into other areas of our lives, from video to office applications to mobile
telephony and beyond.
Five years is forever in Internet time, and in those intervening years the Google AdSense
and Google AdWords tools have grown even more useful and powerful—and more
complex. The need to understand Google’s advertising tools has also become more
universal.
Every business and businessperson needs to know how to position advertising with
AdWords, and should consider how to capitalize on the moneymaking potential of
AdSense. Effective use of both programs requires a practical mastery of a number of
related issues, including how to create an effective Internet marketing plan, implement
Search Engine Optimization (SEO), understand the structure of search, and track
results using programs such as Google Analytics. Besides covering AdSense and
AdWords, this revision of Google Advertising Tools explains these topics.
Google Advertising Tools has been rewritten to take into account changes and advances
in the software, as well as the different needs of our times.
The first edition of Google Advertising Tools explained how to write code that takes
advantage of the Google APIs. However, this kind of programming has become a spe-
cialized arena that no longer belongs in a book aimed at the general business public.
Therefore, this material has been omitted from the revised edition.
xiii

At the same time, the AdSense and AdWords programs have grown to include so many
features that they can seem downright intimidating to someone coming to the programs
for the first time. Don’t worry: I’ll help you host your first AdSense ads and launch your
first AdWords campaigns easily and without fuss. More advanced users will find the
explanations of many potentially confusing bells and whistles helpful.
By the way, Google is constantly improving the features and user interfaces of its ad-
vertising tools (as is true of many web-based applications). So, by the time you read
this book, the way these applications look may be a little different than they do here.
But don’t worry: the core functionality will not have changed, and you should be able
to use the directions in this book without any significant problems.
My focus in Google Advertising Tools is to help you run your business—whether it is
large or small—in a more profitable way though effective use of Google’s advertising
software.
Organization
This book is organized into three parts, with each part containing a number of chapters.
Taken as a whole, these parts cover the gamut of the Google advertising tools. However,
each part can be read as a self-contained unit, and each part is aimed at readers with
different needs.
• Part I, Making Money with a Website, Chapters 1 through 7, explains how to create
a successful website, how to create a marketing plan, how to drive traffic to a
website, the nuts and bolts of SEO, how to make money from a content-based
website, how to build a site that will get traffic, how to get your site noticed, and
the many ways to make money with advertising on your site.
• Part II, Cashing in with AdSense, Chapters 8 and 9, explains how to work with
Google’s AdSense, the premier contextual advertising program for content sites.
Participating in the AdSense program is probably one of the best ways to monetize
your site.
• Part III, Working with AdWords, Chapters 10 through 14, explains the nuts and
bolts, and metrics, of the Google AdWords program, a highly successful mecha-
nism that anybody with a valid credit card can use to place advertisements that
reach over 80 percent of users of the Internet. I’ve added chapters that cover how
to improve AdWords performance, AdWords tactics and strategies, and how to
monitor performance. A final chapter explains AdWords programs that go far be-
yond contextual text ads.
If you read all three parts, you will get a comprehensive picture of how advertising
works on the Web and how you can use the Google advertising programs to your
advantage.
xiv | Preface

Assumptions
This book does not explain HTML and will not tell you how to create or modify web-
sites. To put the concepts and software explained into practice, you need to have basic
knowledge of web fundamentals and skills, or you need to work with a webmaster who
does.
Part I, Making Money with a Website, and Part II, Cashing in with AdSense, are intended
for readers who have, or are interested in building, websites that can be used to make
money with advertising. To take advantage of this material, you will need to be able to
publish web pages and modify the HTML code of these pages; for example, to add
affiliate links and the code needed to display Google AdSense ad units on your pages.
You don’t need any technical skills to become an effective advertiser on the Web using
Google’s AdWords program, although great analytic business skills are a plus. So in a
sense, Part III, Working with AdWords, is the least geeky part of this book, although as
you’ll learn when you read Part III, advertising on the Web does have its own complex
discipline and metrics. If you want to take advantage of AdWords and Google Analytics
tracking features, you’ll need to be able to add JavaScript code to your HTML pages.
To profit from Part III, you need, of course, a service or product to advertise that makes
you money, but webmasters who are simply interested in monetizing the content of
their own sites, and not in advertising per se, will gain from an understanding of “how
the other half lives.” An interesting idea to explore is whether you can profitably drive
traffic to your site using AdWords and make more revenue from AdSense and other
programs than it costs you to get the traffic.
Many people who are interested in business and the Internet should regard the parts
of this book holistically: no matter what part of Internet advertising is most crucial to
you, your understanding will be improved with knowledge of the full life cycle of
planning, driving traffic, implementing SEO, and hosting and creating ads.
About the Examples
Various fragments of HTML and code are presented in this book, such as the short
JavaScript code snippets used to display Google AdSense ad units on your web pages.
Except for the material in Chapter 4, Nuts and Bolts of SEO, you won’t need to work
with this code beyond copying and pasting the snippet that Google provides for you.

Preface | xvii

Phyllis is my hero, as well as my wife and friend. Thanks, Phyllis, for reading the chap-
ters of this book before I submitted them, and for taking up the slack around the house
and with the kids. It’s been a tough year with Katie Rose in the NICU (Newborn In-
tensive Care Unit) for almost three months. I’d like to specially thank Dr. Michael Katz
and all the doctors and nurses at California Pacific Medical Center who took such good
care of our little girl.
With three little boys and a baby girl in the house, music and a good headset are oblig-
atory. Artists I listened to during the revision of this book include Greg Graffin, Alison
Krauss, Robert Plant, Bruce Springsteen, and Sara Watkins. These musicians are, of
course, responsible for all errors and omissions in the text, while I alone deserve credit
for everything I happened to get right!
Thanks to David Iwanow, who revised several of the later chapters after Google updated
its AdWords interface. David would like to thank Adam Briggs, his account manager
at Hot Goanna, for his assistance in ensuring that the updated information and images
would be as current as possible.

PART I
Making Money with a Website


CHAPTER 1
Creating Successful Websites
“Build it and they will come” is a wonderful line in the movies. Too bad it’s usually not
quite so easy in real life! True, good web content is occasionally—not always—dis-
covered surprisingly quickly. More often, it requires a great deal of disciplined work to
draw traffic to a website, no matter how good the content of the site is.
And what is a good site and good web content, anyhow? “Good” does not mean a site
with a halo! The way I use the word good in this chapter is perhaps self-referential: a
site, and its content, are good if the site and its content draws traffic (or can draw traffic
when suitably promoted).
The topic is important because having good content is the single most important de-
terminant in where a site stands in search rankings and whether the site draws traffic.
A site that draws traffic is a potential money maker, or can help you fulfill your business
goals even if these don’t include direct revenue creation. Obviously, other factors
besides content do come into play in determining search rankings, but there is no
substitute for quality content.
Having well-formed and properly tagged content on a site is nice, but it’s not nearly as
important as the site content itself. Keeping content fresh and making sure there are
good links into your site help—but nothing beats good content.
Inbound links, explained in Chapter 4, are at the heart of Google’s
PageRank system. But the rationale for making these links important is
that they are an “objective” way of discovering, and ranking, good
content.
So let’s take a closer look at how web content can be categorized.
If your site has a great deal of traffic, then the site’s traffic is broad. Google itself is a
prime example of a broad-traffic site; people use Google to search for a myriad of
different things. But narrow, or focused, traffic can be more useful to advertisers than
broad, unfocused traffic. For example, a site discussing complex ophthalmological
3

conditions might be very successful with targeted advertising even if it only draws a
few hundred users a day. Google’s traffic becomes more focused, and less broad, when
a keyword search is initiated. All the targeting in the world won’t help unless you get
some eyeballs.
As I’ve suggested, to make money with your website content, it’s a necessary (but not
sufficient) condition that you have good content—either broad or targeted at a specific
niche. Content can mean information, but it also can mean other things—for example,
software applications or jokes.
From a technical viewpoint, there are some issues with setting up a content website so
that you can be flexible as you go along. Flexibility is good—to make money with
advertising, you need to do a great deal of tweaking. I’ll explain how to set up sites so
that you can easily modify advertising as you go along without having to rewrite your
entire site.
The Taxonomy of Success
There’s a great deal of variation in good—successful—content websites. The gist of
these sites varies from humor to practical to editorial opinions and beyond. It’s hard
to generalize. But successful content sites typically do tend to fall into at least one
(maybe more than one) of the following categories:
• The site is humorous and makes visitors laugh.
• The site provides a useful free service.
• The site is an online magazine or newspaper.
• The site provides opinions in the form of a blog or blogs.
• The site provides practical information.
• The site sells a popular product or service.
• The site services a community and provides communication tools for that
community.
The only thing these kinds of sites have in common—and there are undoubtedly other
ways successful sites can be categorized—is that they draw traffic (either focused or
broad). Therefore, they are “good” sites, using my self-referential definition, and are
excellent venues for web advertising. In short, they use web content to make money—
and making money with your website content is the topic of the first part of this book.
Even if you don’t care about making money from content on your website—perhaps
because you are an online retailer with the primary goal of increasing prospects rather
than selling ad space—the issues are the same: you need good content to attract the
search rankings (and therefore the traffic) that you desire.
4 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

In this section, I’ll drill down further on the categorization, or taxonomy, of successful
sites without spending too much time on the issue. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Harlan Stewart once commented about obscenity, it’s hard to define good content, but
you know it when you see it.
The section “How Much Content Is Enough?” on page 17 provides
information about the mechanics of content creation—in other words,
how many pages of content do you need, how frequently should it be
updated, and so on.
Entertainment
Obviously, entertainment is huge on the Web. Many of us spend too much time surfing,
and sites primarily aimed at entertainment can be great traffic draws. The best enter-
tainment destinations typically involve community participation (see “The Power of
Community” on page 29). Other common properties of good entertainment sites is
that they involve humor, and even though entertainment is the primary thrust of the
site, often there is an important educational or communicative component as well.
YouTube, owned by Google and shown in Figure 1-1, is a good example of a broad site
that combines entertainment with other forms of communication. Many people visit
YouTube simply for its entertainment value. In addition, it’s not uncommon to find
software training material posted as YouTube videos and other kinds of material that
are not necessarily entertaining (although they may be edifying).
Some successful entertainment web content sites fill relatively smaller niches. For ex-
ample, CollegeHumor, shown in Figure 1-2, is at the time of this writing the top search
result in Google for the term “humor.” CollegeHumor hosts content of a type and tone
that you’d expect considering its target demographic, and it’s very successful in its role
as a niche entertainment site.
There’s a final category of entertainment site that tends to show specific content based
on a current trend or news item. I hesitate to give specific examples in this category
because these sites, which are mostly parodies or humorous in some other way, tend
to have short half-lives. Like stars going nova, they can draw tons of traffic for a short
while and then fade from view.
Today everyone is bombarded with content in a variety of mediums. Things come and
go quickly. For the most part, topical humor sites that are static, meaning that the
content doesn’t change, publish content that can be expected to fade from public
interest—which means that to make money from this content, you must be prepared
to strike while the iron is hot because it will only be popular for a short while.

Useful Free Services and Software
TinyURL provides a practical and very useful (but simple) service: it allows you to
convert long, unwieldy URLs—for example, like those you often see on Amazon.com
when you select an inventory item—into short, convenient URLs that are easy to use
in HTML code (and easy to enter in a browser). Astoundingly, this service is free. Last
time I looked, TinyURL had more than 185 million hits a month. Talk about traffic!
In part, a service like TinyURL works to generate ad revenue because it is so targeted.
If you go to the site, you’ll find Google AdSense content ads for things like DNS (Do-
main Name Server) services and software that fixes technology problems with browsers.
In other words, technology that addresses the problems of reasonably savvy web users
is likely to be contextually relevant to the concerns of visitors to TinyURL. Enough
users click these ads to more than justify the startup cost and ongoing costs of main-
taining the URL conversion service.

Figure 1-2. CollegeHumor features content that interests its target audience, which is, well, college

It’s splitting hairs to try to decide whether sites that provide access to free downloadable
software are providing a service or information. Whatever the case, a site that provides
information, links, resources, and downloadable software covering a particular tech-
nology can draw a great deal of traffic.
For example, if you want to learn about RSS and Atom syndication software—tools for
reading and writing feeds—and to download this software (and find easy one-stop links
The Taxonomy of Success | 7

for the location of the download sites), a good site to visit is the RSS Compendium.
Because of their usefulness, one-stop technology sites such as the RSS Compendium
(whether or not they provide access to downloads) can draw considerable traffic—and
content-based ad revenue.
If you are going to publish a site whose main draw is access to software, and then make
money off the site with content advertising, bear in mind that software that runs on the
Web typically generates multiple page views for a single user running the software. (In
other words, the user spends time on the website.) This makes it better for the purpose
of generating content revenue than a site that merely publishes information about soft-
ware with download links.
The difference I’ve described is between software that runs on the Web
and software that you download from the Web in order to run locally.
With a download link, once the user downloads the software, there is probably going
to be no more interest in the web content.
Magazines and Newspapers
The business of Salon.com, shown in Figure 1-3, is to provide informed editorial con-
tent. This business is profitable because of the advertising that appears on the Salon
site. The business model of Salon, and other online magazines such as Slate, is pretty
much like that of a brick-and-mortar newspaper or magazine: subsidize the distribution
of articles and editorials, and make revenue with sponsored ads. This works fairly well
on the Web, even though it is essentially old fashioned.
While it is harder to get subscription revenue on the Web than off-web for content,
profit margins for online advertising are higher, and ads can be more reliably targeted
to the context of the content. This last point is important, because it is the unique selling
proposition for web advertising as opposed to advertising in other mediums.
Opinions about whether charging a subscription fee for access to content makes sense
differ at even the most successful online venues. This is a debate that is almost as old
as the Web, and yet to be fully resolved.
For example, as of this writing, the Wall Street Journal does but the New York Times
does not charge for most access. The New York Times online site has a far greater
revenue base from online advertising and certain pay-for-access premium services than
the Wall Street Journal with its entirely subscription-based model. If you include the
New York Times-owned About.com in the comparison, the New York Times is probably
making more money than the Journal.

Figure 1-3. Salon presents topical and interesting articles in the same general fashion as a hardcopy
magazine
There’s evidence that both subscription and advertising newspaper and magazine
models can work on the Web. But at this point, the advertising model seems to be
winning the race.
The Blogosphere
You probably read one or more blogs, at least from time to time. A blog, also called a
weblog or web log, is a diary of entries, usually presented on the Web in reverse chro-
nological order. You may even write your own blog. The subject matter of blogs varies
wildly, from general rants and raves, to blogs about relationships, to blogs more or less
devoted to specific subjects, such as my photography blog.
If you think that a blog about a specific subject is an ideal (although narrow) venue for
targeted advertising content, you are quite right. Unlike opinion sites that are basically
online magazines, blogs are a specifically web phenomenon (sometimes collectively
referred to as the blogosphere). A variety of software mechanisms—such as the ability
to automatically collect trackback links in a blog entry, meaning links to sites or blogs
that discuss the original entry—make blogging an extremely effective and versatile
mechanism for publishing content on the Web. Syndication built into most blog
The Taxonomy of Success | 9

content management software—such as Movable Type or WordPress—allows easy
distribution of the content.
All is not perfect in paradise, though, and there are some problems with blogging as a
vehicle for making money from your content. First, there are so many blogs. It’s easy
to create a blog using hosted services such as Google’s Blogger or Six Apart Software’s
community sites TypePad and LiveJournal. (Six Apart is the publisher of Movable Type
blogging software.) But it’s hard to stand out from the mass of blogs and generate notice
and traffic. See Chapter 2 for some ideas about how to drive traffic to a blog, and
Chapter 10 for information about how to purchase traffic for a blog using Google’s
AdWords contextual advertising program.
Next, the fact that blogs are essentially unvetted and unedited makes some advertisers
leery of placing ads on these sites. If you do expect to make money from advertising on
your blog, it’s a good idea to be careful with spelling, punctuation, and the overall
presentation issues involved with writing.
Finally, most bloggers use hosted blogging services such as Blogger, so they don’t have
to worry about configuring or maintaining their own blogging software. Installing soft-
ware like Movable Type is tricky enough that Six Apart, the company that wrote the
software, will get it going for you on your own web server—for a fee.
But a problem with having a hosted blog may be that it’s not up to you to place adver-
tising on it—if there is contextual advertising, the revenue may go to the blog host. You
should check with specific blog hosts and blog hosting software to determine the rules.
So, if you plan to make money from blogging content, you need to either set up your
own blogging server software, or work with a specialized web hosting organization that
handles the technical end of things but still lets you profit from advertising.
The problem of losing control of the revenue potential of hosted sites
can be present in contexts other than blogging. For example, many
smaller e-commerce websites outsource order processing and shopping
cart functionality. This often makes practical sense, but it may mean
that these pages are no longer available for advertising—or that the ad-
vertising and profits are controlled by the host rather than the site
creator.
Practical Information: Content Sites and Niches
The O’Reilly site provides a great deal of practical information, such as code from the
O’Reilly books. O’Reilly is also a source of (usually) well-informed opinions, mostly
about topics related to technology—for example, the O’Reilly author blogs, articles,
and other quality content.
10 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

Many people turn to the Web as their first line of approach for finding information:
about technology, relationships, travel destinations, and much more. These content
niches are probably the most dependable road to advertising riches on the Web.
Niches don’t necessarily have to be big niches. The smaller the niche, the more targeted
you can be. For example, quality content aimed at answering questions about specific
medical conditions is likely to be in high demand, even if the population with the
condition in question isn’t huge.
Good content positioned in a very narrow niche can be very profitable indeed—but
you need to make sure that there are advertisers willing to pay for target words related
to the niche. A good technique for quickly assessing what advertisers are willing to pay
for specific keywords is to use the Google AdWords Keyword Tool, explained in
Chapter 10. (You don’t need to actually place an ad to use this tool for research
purposes.)
Don’t forget the old saw that it’s better to be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish
in a big pond. Sites that feature a niche that is only of interest to a small group of people
(but very interesting to those people) are likely to achieve high search engine rankings
for the relevant terms, draw traffic through the search engines, and become well known
among aficionados of the niche.
See Chapters 2 and 3 for more information about drawing traffic and search engine
rankings.
If you are the publisher of this kind of niche site, you are likely to make a nice revenue
return in relation to the effort involved.
E-Commerce Sites
Many of the most successful web businesses make their money as e-commerce sites by
selling goods or services. Advertising on these sites is a by-product (you might say, a
product by-product). To name just a few examples:
• Amazon.com is the department store of the Web, selling either on its own account
or for affiliates everything you can imagine.
• eBay is the world’s greatest flea market and auction community, with a great busi-
ness model because it doesn’t need to take an inventory position in the items sold
on its site.
• ETrade, Schwab, and other online trading and investing sites are among the great-
est revenue generators on the Web.
• Gambling sites successfully part players from their funds.
The only things these sites really have in common are they make money by selling
something that people want and they draw traffic (in some cases, such as eBay and
Amazon, lots and lots of traffic).
The Taxonomy of Success | 11

Making money from advertising is not the primary business of this kind of site. Still,
it’s natural to look for additional revenue sources, and many e-commerce sites do sell
advertising, although they all try (or should try) not to let the advertising interfere with
their primary goal—selling products or services online—or with their brand. For ex-
ample, you can buy ad placement for a book or other product on Amazon. These ads
show up as similar items when you are checking out (or considering a purchase). This
works pretty similarly on eBay. You can purchase contextual advertising on eBay—but
only for your products or store on eBay itself.
E-commerce sites besides Amazon and eBay may sell ads based on impressions (also
called CPM, or cost per thousand, advertising), such as banners used for branding
purposes. These sites are very unlikely to sell ads on a pay-per-click basis (also called
CPC, which stands for cost per click) because they want to keep traffic on their sites.
Even CPM ads intended for branding purposes will be scrutinized carefully to ensure
that the branding message is in line with the goal of the e-commerce site.
Tools for Measuring Popularity
The metrics of website traffic is a huge topic by itself, with a number of books just about
web metrics, and quite a bit of software designed simply to help webmasters gather
and understand the metrics of their sites. You’ll find more information about this sub-
ject in Chapter 13, but for now, to get started, it’s important to learn how to quickly
get a feel for a site’s popularity.
Website metrics is a very important topic because to optimize your site
you need to have baseline information as well as feedback so that you
can understand whether changes improve site traffic or not—and also
which elements in your site draw traffic.
This topic is also important because the fees you can expect to get from
advertisers largely depend on the metrics of your site.
Of course, your web server’s logs contain a great deal of traffic information that can
provide you with useful metrics.
But, no doubt, the best metric of all is money in your pocket from goods and services
sold on your site and from fees paid by advertisers—through the AdSense program or
some other mechanism—for publication on your site.
Using the Google Toolbar
The Google Toolbar can be installed in the Internet Explorer web browser. Go to http:
//toolbar.google.com/ to download the toolbar.
12 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

With the Google Toolbar in place, a button (shown at the very top in Figure 1-4) that
can optionally be added to the Toolbar will give an indication of the PageRank, on a 0
to 10 scale, of a web page that is open in your browser. PageRank is a pretty good proxy
for popularity, and as you might expect of an indicator created by Google, the Google
home page is a perfect 10.
Figure 1-4. When you move your mouse over the PageRank button in the Google Toolbar, the relative
popularity of the open web page is indicated on a scale from 0 to 10
The PageRank indication given by the Google Toolbar is not a precise tool. For one
thing, the 0 to 10 scale is a different metric from the PageRank used in Google’s internal
calculations. But as a quick and easy way to gauge PageRank, and therefore popularity,
it is hard to beat this widget.
Let the Google Search Engine Be Your Guide
Since Google is the most popular of all search engines, why not use the search tools
provided by Google itself to get a relative feel for the popularity of websites? I’d suggest
a couple of ways to go about this. The point here is to regularly use the Google search
engine on a variety of sites to get a feeling for how search rankings correspond to traffic.
The link: operator, when used in a Google search query, returns the pages that link to
the specified URL (website address). For example, link:www.wikipedia.org returns all
the pages that link to Wikipedia.org, as you can see in Figure 1-5.
While it should be noted that many inbound links will in fact be internal site links—
also called cross links—quantifying the pages that link to a given site is an easy way to
get a sense of Google’s assessment of a site’s popularity and, therefore, its traffic. (For
more about the various kinds of linking, see Chapter 4.)
An alternative approach involves a bit of keyword analysis. You’ll need to understand
what the most common keywords used to search for the site you are interested in are.
Tools for Measuring Popularity | 13

This kind of keyword analysis, of course, is something you should do in any case if you
are interested in promoting a site. As a simple example, if you were trying to find out
how a site with a directory of dentists fared in search rankings, you could enter the
word dentist in Google search and see where the site is returned in the results.
Armed with the search terms, you can run searches yourself. Over time, this will disclose
whether a given site is moving up or down in the search rankings, and, as a snapshot,
should give you an idea of whether a site is popular at all. A site should be in the top
30 search return results (the first three pages) to be considered a successful search result
for a given term. In other words, you need to be on the first three pages to have a shot
at getting decent traffic from a search engine.
Figure 1-5. Checking inbound links, like those shown here to Wikipedia, helps show the popularity
of a site

Finding Popularity with Alexa
I’ve already mentioned Google as an example of a site with broad traffic. There are, of
course, many others. If you are curious, you can go to Alexa, which monitors how much
traffic a site gets and the relative increase (or decrease) in site popularity.
Alexa is owned by Amazon.com.
On the Alexa site, click on the Top Sites tab to see an ordered list of the most highly
trafficked sites, updated daily. The most trafficked sites (at the time of this writing)
according to Alexa are shown in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6. You can find the current most popular websites using Alexa
Alexa’s Movers and Shakers, shown in Figure 1-7, is also interesting. This snapshot of
the “right here and now” Web is useful for seeing if there are any web-wide trends in
action—and also for learning about the kinds of exogenous events that move large-
scale websites up and down the chutes and ladders of popularity.
Tools for Measuring Popularity | 15

While it is probably unrealistic to expect that you or I will be piloting sites that are at
the top of Alexa’s list, it is worth spending time learning about popularity on the Web
if you want to build successful sites. Alexa provides the tools you can use to see for
yourself what is trafficked and what is gaining or losing among top-ranked sites.
You can also use Alexa to see traffic statistics for sites that are not in the top 500. For
almost any site that has been around a while, Alexa will give you an idea of traffic
statistics and whether it is gaining or losing traffic.
Alexa lets you enter descriptive information about your website, which
others can see if they check your site traffic using Alexa. You can also
make sure that Alexa provides a snapshot of your home page along with
its statistics. Since this service is free, it is certainly worth entering a site
description.
Alexa works by collating results from users throughout the Web who have installed the
special Alexa Toolbar. (If you’d like, you too can install the Alexa Toolbar and help
with popularity statistics.) There’s some question about the statistical validity of Alexa
for less trafficked sites because of this method of gathering data—that is, Alexa’s results
are probably skewed toward users who are already web savvy and heavy users.
Figure 1-7. Alexa’s Movers and Shakers can help with your education about what moves sites up and
down the popularity ladder
16 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

Just as the Google Toolbar can provide you with information about the
popularity of sites as you surf the Web, the Alexa Toolbar can give you
helpful data about the relative popularity of sites. The Alexa Toolbar is
particularly helpful in finding and comparing similar sites.
Most likely, Alexa’s results are not very meaningful for sites that are ranked below
100,000 in popularity (very roughly, with fewer than 10,000 visitors per week).
The Alexa ranking of 100,000 or lower is also a great divide: if your site is in the top
100,000, you have content that many advertisers will consider worthwhile. Being in
the top Alexa results is a pretty good goal for your website or sites. You can make real
money from a top 100,000 site; it is an ambitious goal, but attainable.
Ranking.com provides a popularity ranking service comparable to
Alexa’s.
How Much Content Is Enough?
Suppose you create 1 web page every 100 days that generates $100 in ad revenue.
Alternatively, you create 1 page per day for 100 days. Each page generates $1 in ad
revenue. Either way, you end up with $100 at the end of 100 days.
The point is that there are different ways to go about deciding how much content to
create—it significantly depends on the quality of the content. A single content page
might make sense if it contained a valuable application like TinyURL (see “Useful Free
Services and Software” on page 6). If your pages are low-value content, you will need
a great many of them to make significant revenue from advertising.
Between the two extremes—a single page of valuable content and many pages of low-
value content—lies a happy medium that will work for most content-based sites by
creating enough critical mass to draw both traffic and advertisers. If you are just starting
out, this happy medium is a goal to which you can reasonably aspire.
Here’s what you need, at a minimum, to have a site drawing respectable numbers at
the end of one year:
• 100 pages of quality content “in the can” to start with
• On average, one new page of quality content every day for a year (each page con-
taining about 300 words)
How Much Content Is Enough? | 17

Presenting Content
Content is king. Content is certainly king if your business model is to publish content
on the Web and make money from advertising with traffic drawn by the content. Your
first rule should be: don’t “dis” the king. In other words, don’t do anything to distract
from the content, make it harder for surfers to find content they need, or make the
graphics that frame the content too jazzy. In particular, if the graphics seem too
important, they will distract from the content.
A particularly annoying sin on content-based websites is the use of an
animated splash page (such as Flash) to open the site. If you do use an
animation to open your site, users should easily be able to bypass it if
they desire. At the same time, you should work to keep unnecessary
navigation down. In other words, don’t make people click an extra link
to get to a destination (unless the extra click is a well-thought-out part
of the user experience).
Page and Site Design
These rules of content presentation can be positive (rather than negative):
It should be obvious that the purpose of the site is to clearly present content
Choose a name for the site, and titles and headers for the pages, that make it abun-
dantly clear that the purpose of the site is to present content, and (as a general
matter) what that content is.
The design of the site should serve the purpose of presenting content
Site design should be intended to facilitate navigation and frame the content—
nothing more and nothing less.
Specific content items and subject areas should be easy to find
Provide multiple mechanisms for finding things: index pages, search boxes, site
maps, subject areas, and so on.
Type should be legible
Be careful to choose a readable font, in a large enough size, and background and
foreground color combinations that are easy on the eyes. It’s hard to go wrong with
black type on a white background. The reverse—white on black—is hard on the
eyes, and some combinations (for example, dark blue on lighter blue) are essentially
unreadable.
Keep graphics simple
For example, avoid animations and other splashy images.
As it happens, following the rules of content presentation I’ve outlined will serve you
well with search engine placement (see Chapter 4). But that’s not the point of these
suggestions here. The point is usefulness and transparency to site users. If viable content
is presented in an accessible fashion, then indeed “they will come.”
18 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

If you are targeting your content specifically for Google’s AdSense program (or a com-
petitive contextual engine), you should also bear in mind the following:
• AdSense can’t interpret images (except using captions, the value of alt attributed
in the <img> tag, the name of the image file, and surrounding text), so keep images
to a minimum.
• You are likely to get more relevant ads if you keep each page to a single subject
(and move tangential subject matters to different pages).
• Key concepts, words, and phrases should be clear by glancing at a page. (See
Chapter 3 for information about how to use these keywords and phrases to opti-
mize your pages for AdSense, Google, and other search engines.)
Page Size
How much content should go on each site page? Like Goldilocks and the three bears,
the answer is not too much and not too little—just the right amount of content.
It’s in the interest of the site publisher to keep pages short, because the same amount
of content spread over shorter pages makes for more pages. And more pages on a site
means more places for advertising, which in theory might mean more revenue.
In addition, more pages may mean more page views, implying better metrics to adver-
tisers who don’t look too carefully.
However, if you break an article up into many short pages that a user has to click
through, users will find it irritating—and vote with their time by frequenting the site
less often.
For an example of a site that has chosen to maximize pages it can place
ads on at the cost of potentially alienating readers by dividing articles
up into many small pages that must be clicked through, see The
Street.com.
The happy medium is to be natural about page length. The natural length for a content
page is the content that will reasonably fit into a maximized browser window without
having to scroll.
Obviously this is a rough, rather than a precise, guideline, as different browsers on
different systems will show different size pages.
Don’t gratuitously break an article into multiple pages unless the article really is longer
than a few browser-sized pages. Also, don’t break an article (even if it is long) unless
there are natural breaks in the content. Anytime there is a new Level 1 header in an
article, it’s a good sign that you could break to a new content page without the break
feeling forced.
Presenting Content | 19

A related issue is to be careful about the width of your content pages. People will be
looking at your web pages using a variety of hardware, operating systems, and
browsers—the most important variable being the monitor size. You don’t want your
readers to have to scroll to the right because part of a content web page is off the screen.
This is very bad form and may also obscure content advertising if it is positioned along
the right border of the page.
The answer is to design pages for lowest common denominator displays. In practice,
content pages should be no wider than 800 pixels. Pages 800 pixels wide (or less) should
display without scrolling on most (although not all) computers—some displays are still
only 640 pixels wide. (For more on this, see “Positioning Ads” on page 21.) In other
parts of the world, and depending on the display devices used by your target audience,
you may want to consider going even smaller than these sizes.
Images, Video, and Podcasting
As previously noted, visual (and audio) content cannot be as readily indexed by search
engines as straight text. That said, a picture is worth a thousand words, and there’s no
arguing with the popularity of podcasts and video sites like YouTube. So, it’s a trade-
off. Content-based websites need some content in media that is splashier than plain
text, like the aforementioned images, video, and podcasting. On the other hand, this
kind of content doesn’t necessarily help search rankings, and may not provide a hosting
environment for advertisement within the media that is available to any but the largest
content providers.
Keeping Content Fresh
Have you ever tried to keep fresh-caught fish fresh? It isn’t easy. Neither is keeping site
content fresh. But sites, and their content, need to stay fresh. It’s not a big deal to change
the overall look of a site by changing the graphic used as a navigation bar every month
or so—that is, if you’ve set the site up with server-side includes, so that editing one file
changes the site globally. But keeping content fresh is a trickier issue.
Since search engines appreciate new content, some sites go to great lengths to provide
content that appears new—for example, by displaying syndication feeds on the site’s
home page. This may help with search engines (I have more to say on this point in
Chapter 3), but it doesn’t do much at all for your primary audience—real people.
Quality content sites need to strike a balance. You need to have a core of worthwhile
reference material that doesn’t change much. You also need to keep content sites fresh.
As you plan your successful site, you should consider what strategy you will use to keep
people coming back for the latest and greatest. For example, do you plan to keep up
with the latest events in a technology niche, such as a programming language? Will you
feature articles about current cultural events (which are constantly changing by defi-
nition)? Or will your site present interesting blogs with frequently added entries?
20 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

Positioning Ads
Studies have shown that ad positioning is crucial to content revenue generation. Posi-
tioning means the physical position of an ad on a web page, the size of the ad, and also
which page(s) on a site carry an ad.
As I explain in Chapter 8, when using a program like Google’s AdSense, you’ll want to
use AdSense to generate code that displays ads sized to your site, and also in colors that
work with your site.
Although there are some general guidelines for what works best with advertising po-
sitioning, it is far more art than science. You should expect to spend a fair amount of
time tweaking ad position to see what works best—another good reason for having a
site mechanism in place that allows you to change ad settings globally by editing one
include file.
Tweaking ads is good for another reason: you don’t want ad fatigue to set in. Ad fatigue
is a term used by webmasters to describe the phenomenon in which visitors to your
site are so used to the ad display on your site that they ignore it. Experimenting with
new ad positioning (and colors) is a good way to combat that “same old, same old”
feeling—and avoid ad fatigue.
Most studies show that ads positioned above the fold do better than ads lower on a
page. Above the fold means visible without scrolling. The smaller the monitor, and the
lower its resolution, the less screen real estate there is above the fold. In other words,
a monitor running at 640 × 480 pixels screen resolution has a lot less available real estate
above the fold than a monitor running at 800 × 600, which in turn has much less area
above the fold than a monitor running at higher resolution.
If you want the maximum eyeballs—and you should, because more eyeballs means
more advertising revenue—you should try to place ads so that they will be above the
fold on lower resolution monitors. It certainly makes sense to target 800 × 600 monitor
resolution, because this is widely in use. Don’t finalize your ad positioning (and website
and page design) without checking it out on an 800 × 600 monitor.
Some research has shown that vertical ad blocks—the kind Google calls skyscrapers—
work better than horizontal ads. However, from the viewpoint of basic geometry, it is
easier to fit a horizontal ad block above the fold than a vertical skyscraper—the lower
part of the skyscraper is likely to be below the fold. If you decide to go with vertical ad
blocks, make sure they are positioned as high as possible, and that at least one ad
(assuming the skyscraper contains multiple contextual ads) is positioned above the
fold.
One other major positioning issue is context. From the viewpoint of a content publisher,
you’d like to position ads so that they are not only contextually relevant, but also so
that they lead to a high click-through rate.
Presenting Content | 21

With programs like Google’s AdSense, context is important because you
want a high click-through rate. With affiliate advertising, context is even
more important because you don’t make any money without a conver-
sion, which means turning someone into a customer. You may, perhaps,
care less about context when you are paid by the impression—in that
case, all you really care about is that the ad gets seen on your site.
Google’s AdSense attempts to place only contextually relevant ads. With some notable
lapses, AdSense is pretty successful at this. In any case, you can’t exercise a great deal
of control over the ads that AdSense displays on your site—you have to trust that
Google gets this right.
You can forbid your competitor’s ads from appearing on your site by
using the AdSense option that allows you to ban specific IP addresses.
The ability to ban IP addresses can be used to a limited degree to also
keep out advertisers you find offensive. For example, an animal rights
information site might want to ban ads from prominent furriers.
There are some important aspects of context that you can control, although there is no
reliable analytic research about what works best. Some sites use graphics and posi-
tioning to make contextual ads blend in with the site and appear almost part of the
editorial content. Other sites feel that keeping the appearance of editorial integrity is
vitally important, and use color and position to instantly indicate that the ads are sep-
arate from the body of the content.
Overloading pages with ads generally does not work because viewers tend to ignore
pages that have too many ads. If you’re working with multiple ad programs and kinds
of ads to generate a revenue stream, you can make an important contribution to ad
context by deciding what kinds of ads should go with what content. For example, it
might make sense to advertise books on Amazon on a page of book reviews.
There’s also a school of thought that believes ads should only be placed on boring
pages—for example, registration pages, login pages, resource pages, and exit pages.
(An exit page is a page designed to launch a visitor onward following a visit—for ex-
ample, an order confirmation.) One reason for placing click-through ads on resource
and exit pages is that visitors will be leaving your site from these pages anyhow. You
won’t be losing traffic by providing click-through opportunities.
The more general logic for placing ads only on boring pages is that it gives the rest of
your site a clean, inviting, ad-free look—and that visitors are more likely to click on
ads in the context of boredom than in the context of exciting content.
Whatever strategy you decide to try, if you will be varying ad programs depending on
context, you should attempt to implement this programmatically rather than by man-
ually adding and deleting advertising code from individual HTML pages.

Content Architecture
You should think about site architecture before you create your first content page. Site
architecture should be arranged so that you can make global changes to the look and
feel of a site with no impact on the content. You also want to be able to change the
code for an ad program, or even swap one ad program for another, once and have the
changes take effect across your site in all the content pages.
Separating Content from Design
When you create content websites, it’s imperative to use mechanisms that separate web
page content from design. The purpose of separating content from design is to let you:
• Easily change the look and feel of a site without the change in overall site design
having any impact on the content
• Tweak positioning and other ad-related variables to maximize revenue without
having any effect on site content
The simplest way to achieve these goals is to use includes—server-side includes—to
position site graphics such as navigation bars. A server-side include is a file that the
server includes within another file (the inclusion is specified by a special directive).
When you view the HTML source code in a browser, you have no way of telling whether
the main file was generated using includes or not.
Includes can also be used for advertisement code, such as that provided by Google’s
AdSense. By changing the code in a single include, you can change the navigation bar
or advertising parameters across all the content pages on an entire site.
The most important thing, as a content web publisher, is to be on board with the
concept of separating design from content, and advertising content from normal page
content. The overriding reason for doing this is so you can tweak both the site design
and the advertising content.
The mechanics for separating advertising content, published content, and design as-
pects of a site are fairly simple.
Site-Wide Changes to Styles
Although it’s somewhat less important than the ability to easily do site-wide changes
of advertisements and site graphics such as navigation bars, it’s still nice to be able to
perform site-wide changes of text styles. It is less important because leaving everything
as reasonably sized black text on a white background is usually just fine.
Style attributes can be set using a server-side include. Each content page then includes
the include file, which contains the styles for the content. Text styles can be changed
on a global basis simply by changing the definitions of the styles within the include file.
Content Architecture | 23

Another simple mechanism for doing site-wide font and font-size changes is to use an
external style sheet to define the fonts and sizes to use with various types of text (each
content page references the style sheet). To effect a global change, simply change the
style definitions in the external style sheet.
Server-side includes work well to separate key design elements (and advertisements)
from content, provided your content site doesn’t have too many pages, and assuming
that each page doesn’t have a great many repetitive elements.
If many of your content pages are essentially the same—meaning they have the same
elements but the value of the elements differs from page to page—you should probably
be using a templating system. Templates use special tags for the common elements,
with the actual content for each page that replaces the special tag specified, often using
content stored in a database table. This means that an appropriately written template
file and one or more database tables can populate and create a whole raft of web pages—
one for each row in the table.
PHP is one of the most popular server-side programming languages available on the
Web (most inexpensive Linux/Apache web host services let you program in PHP with-
out any additional configuration effort).
If you are a programmer, or have access to programming talent, you can create your
own templating system using PHP or some other language. But why reinvent the wheel?
A popular PHP templating system, available for free download, is Smarty. One of the
great features of Smarty is that it caches a web page the first time it is generated from
a template. Subsequent calls to the page, unless the template or data have changed,
open the cached page—meaning the website isn’t slowed down by page generation
each time the templated page is opened.
A server-side include mechanism is a great start for creating a manageable content site
and—from a technology standpoint—within the grasp of almost anyone. (I explained
the server-side include mechanism and how to use it to lay out a content site to receive
advertising in “Content Architecture” on page 23.)
Templating is a good next step if you (or an associate) have the technological sophis-
tication and expect to be managing content sites with thousands of pages. It’s partic-
ularly important to use a system of templates if you expect to generate pages using data
from a database.
Suppose you are managing a site with not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of
pages. You have multiple authors, a team of editors, and a workflow process to make
sure that work is fact-checked, copyedited, and approved before it is published. In this
case, you’ll want to use Web Content Management (WCM) software to provide content
and design separation, template features, workflow management, and more. Commer-
cial WCM packages are available from vendors including IBM, FileNet, Interwoven,
Microsoft, Stellent, Vignette, and others.
24 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

Not everyone recognizes that, in fact, blogging software such as Mova-
ble Type and WordPress in effect manages web content using special
tags and a template system. You can use WordPress in particular to
manage pages that are not part of a blog. So if it’s appropriate for your
particular project, consider creating a “blogosite”—a content website
managed by blogging software such as WordPress.
No matter what mechanism you use, it is vitally important to separate form from con-
tent so that you can easily keep your site design fresh and tweak advertising positions.
Server-Side Includes
The simplest mechanism for implementing a “change code in one place, change the
whole site” architecture is to use server-side includes (see “Separating Content from
Design” on page 23).
Most web hosting accounts provide a server-side include mechanism. You tell the web
server which file extensions mean that a file can have includes. When the web server
processes the file to send back to a browser for display, it looks for the special syntax
that means there is an include. When it sees this syntax, it expands the page it is serving
to the browser by expanding it with the file indicated by the include’s syntax.
The default file extension for a web page is usually .shtml, although you can add other
file extensions so that your web server will look through them for includes (there is, of
course, a slight performance hit for this).
Figure 1-8 shows a typical Linux and Apache web host administrative utility with the
mouse cursor pointing at the button that lets you add file extensions to be parsed for
includes.
For example, suppose you have a simple .shtml home page like this:
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>A simple little home page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    ...
    </body>
</html>
You could create two include files:
• styles.html, which contains CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) styles for the elements used
on the site such as font size and color
• top-bar.html, which contains the site navigation bar
Content Architecture | 25

Figure 1-8. You can add file extensions to be parsed for includes by the web server
You can link to an external CSS style sheet or define your CSS styles in
an include file. Either way, to change styles site-wide, you just have to
change the style definitions in one file.
The site home page, and every other content page on the site, includes these two files
as follows:
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>A simple little home page</title>
    <!--#include virtual="includes/styles.html" -->
    </head>
    <body>
    <!--#include virtual="includes/top-bar.html" -->
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    ...
    </body>
</html>
Now it’s easy to change the appearance of the text on each page of the site by just
making one change to styles.html. And, if you need to change the appearance of the
navigation bar, you can simply make the changes to top-bar.html, and it will be repli-
cated across the site.
26 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

There’s generally no requirement that included files be named with any
particular file extension—instead of .html you can perfectly well
use .foo, or anything else you’d like. One tip is to avoid a file extension
that begins with “z”—some search engines will assume it’s a type
of .zip file and they won’t index it!
PHP Includes
If you are constructing a dynamic site using PHP (see “Separating Content from De-
sign” on page 23) or using PHP for other programmatic purposes on your site, it makes
sense to use the PHP include mechanism.
Whatever technology you use to serve your site, it undoubtedly has an
include mechanism that works pretty much like server-side includes and
PHP includes.
Most Linux- and Apache-based web hosts provide PHP scripting automatically for files
named with a .php file extension. Within these files, PHP includes work almost exactly
like server-side includes.
For example, suppose you have a simple little web home page in a file named index.php:
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head>
        <title>Simple Little Web Home Page </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
    </body>
</html>
If you put the CSS styles for the elements of the website, such as the appearance of
website text, in a file named style.inc, it can be included in PHP code like this:
<? include 'style.inc'; ?>
The code for the top portion of a page, to be shared in common across the site, might
be put in a file named top.inc. It could now be inserted at the top of the body of a content
page using the PHP include directive:
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head>
        <title> Simple Little Web Home Page </title>
        <? include 'style.inc'; ?>
    </head>
    <body>
        <? include 'top.inc'; ?>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
Content Architecture | 27

As with the server-side include example, if all the pages in a site use the PHP directives
to include style.inc and top.inc, then site styles and the top element can be changed
globally just by changing the contents of these include files.
Note that you can include PHP code—including other PHP include directives—within
PHP includes, and that there is no requirement that includes be named with any par-
ticular file suffix.
Optimal Include Layout
The optimal include layout is to provide includes for both geographic areas of your web
page and for specific ad programs. The two should not be the same, although one can
go inside the other, and (at least initially) consume all its area. If you don’t follow this
organizing principle, down the road—to take one example—you’ll find that you named
the include for the entire right side of your content pages Google_ad_right, even though
by now it contains a variety of graphic elements, but no Google skyscraper.
The composition of PHP includes used on a site with optimum flexibility is shown in
diagram form in Figure 1-9.
Figure 1-9. Using includes for both geographic areas of site pages and specific ad content creates
flexibility that allows for easily implementing future changes
Figure 1-9 shows that there is an include for each geographic area of a page that will
carry graphics or ads: top include, left include, bottom include, and right include. Within
the geographic includes are ad-program-specific includes for each ad program or type
of ad, such as a Google ad module. A final include holds a navigation panel at the top
of the site above the page individual content. The point here is to allow for flexibility
28 | Chapter 1: Creating Successful Websites

both in terms of page geography and in the ads or ad modules that will appear on
specific pages.
This arrangement gives the maximum flexibility and won’t have you contorted like a
pretzel in the future. You can change any of the graphics in a geographic include. Al-
ternatively, you can change ad code, swap, add, and delete ad programs in a very gran-
ular fashion. Changes take place globally across a site, but they have very little impact
on the rest of a page.
Where Does Content Come From?
No, content doesn’t grow on trees. Content is a valuable commodity—and perhaps
more than a commodity. Great content is wonderful and unique, and not fungible.
Communities can supply a great deal of content if you have an idea for a good frame-
work that will entice contributions about specific subjects.
If you are a writer, you can create content yourself. (Maybe this is the time for your
inner writer to finally come out!)
Site owners can hire writers, either as employees or freelancers, or with a profit-sharing
arrangement.
You can often pick up the rights to publish material on the Web that was originally
created for a book, magazine, or newspaper very inexpensively. Content creators may
be placed to let you use their content simply in exchange for publicity—in the form of
an author credit as an expert and/or a link.
You also might check out book and literary agencies—some of them run a sideline
business supplying aggregated recycled content, and represent whole groups of writers.
So even if you aren’t confident that you can personally create valuable content, don’t
despair; there are many inexpensive ways to publish valuable content without writing
it yourself.
Don’t underestimate the value of resource pages as content. A simple page of links to
sites related to a specific subject (for example, sites of interest to collectors of antique
typewriters and calculators) may draw traffic if the links are accurately described, kept
up to date, and expanded when new relevant sites are opened.
The Power of Community
From its very earliest beginnings, the Web has largely been about community. From a
practical standpoint, involving a worthwhile community is a great way to create con-
tent. You don’t need to create the content yourself; your users do—for example, by
contributing to discussion threads or by making syndication feeds available.
The Power of Community | 29

Site owners can use community to leverage their content and to create sites that are
valuable to users because of the involvement of the community.
If your site is extended by community members (for example, through a discussion
thread), you may have little control over the quality of the content. As an advertising
venue, this content may not be worth that much. But even if it is only worth pennies a
day in advertising revenue, the content generation is on autopilot—it is expanding,
changing, and staying relevant on its own. So you may still be making a good return
on your effort.
Community has made eBay great—essentially all the content comes from users of the
eBay auction system. Amazon makes extensive use of community to fill out its content
with reviews of books and other products.
Even if your site is essentially not a community site, you can use contributions from
visitors to extend and round-out your own content. Successful examples include com-
ments on blogs and reader reviews on a site. Another idea for obtaining content that
some webmasters have used successfully is to run contests (“Best story in pictures and
words about a diving trip” for a scuba diving site is one example).
Mechanisms you can use to build community on a site include:
• Message boards
• Chat rooms
• Calendars with information about events in a specific field
• Instant messaging applications
• Reader reviews
• Blog comments and trackbacks
You probably wouldn’t want to program an application that enabled
much of this community functionality from the ground up, but the fact
is that your web host may provide this software for free, versions may
be available from the open source community that are also free, or you
may be able to inexpensively outsource the application.
If you are hosting your own blog with standard software like Movable Type or Word-
Press, the software will give you the ability to enable comments and trackbacks out of
the box.

CHAPTER 2
Creating Effective Marketing Plans
“No man is an island,” wrote the poet John Donne in 1624. Donne’s famous meditation
suggests that all of humanity is connected, and that individuals do not thrive if they
regard themselves as entirely separate from one another. It works the same way with
websites.
To build a successful website (with success defined in Chapter 1 simply as a site that
draws either broad or specific targeted traffic), you need to get other sites to link to
your site. Chapter 3 discusses many of the tactics needed to generate these in-bound
links. In addition, you need an overall strategy for increasing the visibility of your site.
This strategy likely involves optimization of your content for search engine ranking and
tactical advertising, as I explain later in this chapter (the nuts of bolts of optimization
are explained in Chapter 4, and advertising with AdWords is the subject of Part III).
But these techniques should not be regarded as “islands.” They are necessary, but not
sufficient in and of themselves.
Creating a successful website requires an effective campaign plan that blends the tac-
tical techniques at your disposal. To some degree, this is Marketing 101.
Any good campaign plan must communicate a compelling story about your site and
brand. The plan should also provide a roadmap, so that you know the steps you need
to take, and provide a framework with which to benchmark your efforts. Finally, the
plan should consider which marketing tools and techniques are most likely to help you
achieve your campaign goals.
Telling a Story
At its simplest, marketing means telling a story. This story should be reducible to the
well-known elevator pitch: a story that is succinct enough to be told, usually in a single
sentence, between the stops of an elevator ride.
33

Why is it smart to be able to convey your marketing idea as a (very) short story? As far
as the issue of brevity goes, nobody has much time these days, particularly on the Web.
Therefore, you only have a brief moment to get the attention of your target audience.
Narrative, another word for a story, is simply more compelling to most people than
“just plain facts.” Think about it. On your time off, which are you more likely to read:
an exciting story or a technical brief? Assume that both are about a small company
creating an innovative product and beating the gigantic competition. Most people,
hardcore propeller heads aside, will pick the story every time.
Almost without exception, any business story that works contains one or more of the
following narrative elements. These elements are identified and described by Guy
Kawasaki in his blog story “The Nine Best Story Lines for Marketing” and Lois Kelly
in her book Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing
(Amacom):
The Enterprise in danger
One of the prime directives of the scripts of the original Star Trek series was that
the Starship Enterprise needed to be in danger in each episode. Even viewers who
found the show kitschy (or maybe especially viewers who found the show kitschy)
were hooked by the narrative tension of wondering if (or, more accurately, how)
the Starship Enterprise would survive.
The “Enterprise in danger” narrative works best as a business-to-business story.
Here’s how it goes: your business is in danger and will be shot out of the sky by
space aliens unless you buy our tools, which will (a) stop the aliens in their tracks,
or (b) rescue you from prison on the alien planet if all else fails.
A great example of a successful (and perfectly legitimate) “Enterprise in danger”
pitch is the anti-computer virus story told by McAfee, Norton, and others.
Heroic
We all like to hear heroic marketing stories. Since biblical times, it has thrilled us
to learn how David beat Goliath. One reason for this fascination with the little guy
prevailing against all odds is we identify with small players. If this “David” could
do it, then so could we.
A classic example of a heroic marketing campaign is that waged for years by ice
cream vendor Ben & Jerry’s against corporate behemoths like Pillsbury and General
Foods. Note that this story still plays through Ben & Jerry’s packaging and mar-
keting collateral even though Ben & Jerry’s has been swallowed by one of their
former large competitors.
Against the grain
A marketing story that goes against common assumptions and prejudices gets at-
tention. It makes us say “Huh!?!” and pay attention to the remainder of the pitch.
But be warned: this approach is potentially dangerous and can backfire. You need
to be very sure that your full story counteracts the counterintuitive aspects of the
“against the grain” pitch. If it doesn’t, you risk losing your audience.
34 | Chapter 2: Creating Effective Marketing Plans

Anxiety
Closely related to the “Enterprise in danger” narrative, anxiety tends to play best
with social embarrassment issues. For example, many (if not most) deodorant ads
are intended to evoke, and then allay, these kinds of personal concerns. In other
words, the Enterprise may not be in danger, but there’s an unpleasant condition
making it not quite ship-shape, and you wouldn’t want another Star Captain seeing
the vessel right now. In the business-to-business context, anxiety story lines tend
to play to business rivalries that are not life-and-death issues. But not all anxiety
pitches are as trivial as underarm wetness. You’ll recognize many anxiety stories
in the advertising of financial services and insurance companies. For example,
“Will you have enough money to retire?”
Seasonal or event tie-in
Obviously, Christmas or other gift-giving holidays make a good marketing story,
as do other seasonal or event tie-ins such as trade shows, business mergers, and
movie openings. The right kind of event can be an opportunity to add glamour to
a marketing story, as well as provide a practical motivation and call to action.
Glamour
Everyone wants to be associated with glamour, which is why there is widespread
interest in movie stars. Marketing stories that manage to associate a product or
service with glamour tend to get attention. Obviously, our society’s fascination
with glamour explains the ubiquity of celebrity endorsements as part of marketing
stories.
Aspirational
Aspirational stories appeal to the desire most people have for a strong emotional
and intellectual connection with community and the businesses they care about.
A story that pitches the convergence of a variety of emerging digital media is as-
pirational, as is one that involves helping to alleviate global warming or pollution.
Hope is aspirational.
How-to
How-to stories are one of the most basic, straightforward, and ubiquitous story
lines. What can the product or service do for me? Some how-to pitches are closely
related to the “Enterprise in danger” story, while others help people achieve as-
pirational or personal goals. For example, social networking sites on the Web help
consumers achieve their personal goals of meeting like-minded souls (for example,
Facebook) or business contacts (for example, LinkedIn). The marketing story for
these services largely focuses on the practical aspects of how they help people ach-
ieve their goals, although the marketing story will also include aspirational aspects
of helping to build community.
Personal stories
There’s no better way to illustrate a point than to tell a personal story. This accounts
for the raft of personal testimonial advertising, as well as the propensity for in-
spirational speakers at sales events to charge up the audiences with anecdotes from
Telling a Story | 35

their careers or youth. When the personal combines with the aspirational, the result
is often a compelling marketing story.
The Elevator Pitch
You should be able to summarize your story in a sentence or two (this is sometimes
called an elevator pitch). For example:
Digital photography resources, techniques, software, equipment reviews, and photo
galleries.
is a story that will probably attract people interested in digital photography. On the
other hand:
Ramblings of a grouchy, cranky person who, well, rambles about everything.
is not a targeted story likely to interest anyone for long.
Once you’ve come up with the gist of your story, you can combine the narrative ele-
ments in the story with the fundamental concepts of marketing to create your marketing
plan.
While you are thinking about the essentials of your story to create your elevator pitch,
you should also come up with a list of the words that are most relevant. These important
words are referred to as keywords. A good set of keywords is very valuable. They can
be used and reused in marketing (for example, in press releases), in website construction
(for example, as meta tags), and as targets to acquire for online advertising programs
such as Google AdWords.
Use your plan and story to create a summary of your site, a list of
keywords related to your site content, and one or more press releases
(as I explain in Chapter 3, in “The Power of the Press Re-
lease” on page 68). The site summary and keyword list also can be
used to create meta information for your site, as I explain in Chapter 4.
Basics of Marketing
It’s likely that you think of marketing as selling and promoting. In fact, these activities
are part of marketing. But the real goal of marketing is to have a product or service that
sells itself. For example, no one really needs to sell YouTube; users just flock to the site
for the service it offers. At its highest level, a good marketing campaign understands
the markets and the potential buyers so well that the offering can be positioned in such
a way that it sells itself.
36 | Chapter 2: Creating Effective Marketing Plans

You may be saying to yourself, “Why should I care about this stuff? I’m
just trying to draw traffic to a website.”
While classic marketing theory predates the Web, and much of it is, in
any case, common sense, the more marketing principles you understand
and use, the more likely you are to succeed in marketing your website.
The essential concepts in the theory of marketing are often remembered using the
mnemonic “5Ps”:
Product
The product, or offering, is the thing or service that is being marketed. The product
is not always what meets the eye. For example, a popular music group that sells
CDs may actually be using the recordings as a promotional tool for live concerts,
which is where the group really makes money. In a similar fashion, there are many
websites where the real money-making offering is cloaked in content intended to
draw traffic.
Price
The price is the amount that is charged for the product or service. Price bears an
intriguing relationship to positioning because a high price often denotes value.
You’ve surely heard the phrase, “You get what you pay for.” It’s often (although
not always) true—and leads purchasers to assume that low-priced goods or services
are inferior (as well as the converse).
On the Web, a pricing problem for content owners is the ideological position (and
belief of many consumers) that “content wants to be free.” The usual end-run
around this entrenched position is to take advantage of the belief of many that there
is no cost to viewing advertisements. Affiliate programs (Chapter 5), hosted ad-
vertising (Chapter 6), and the Google AdSense program (Part II) are the primary
mechanism for monetizing web traffic with advertising.
Place
The place refers to the distribution channels that the product will go through to
reach the consumer. In the physical world, placing and distributing products can
involve complex issues of warehousing, financing, and negotiating price. From the
viewpoint of a web content provider, issues of place fundamentally come down to
the strategies employed to draw traffic. The two leading strategies are Search En-
gine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO), explained later in
this chapter.
Promotion
Promotion means the methods used to raise awareness about the product with the
target market.
Positioning
Positioning is understanding how to place the product in the mind of the purchaser,
and how that placement relates to the structure of the marketplace.
Basics of Marketing | 37

Creating a Plan
The process of telling a marketing story and integrating the story into the 5P funda-
mentals is shown in diagram form in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1. By combining business narrative with marketing fundamentals, you can create a marketing
plan
Taking the 5Ps of marketing in the context of a web content site, Place and Price are
somewhat irrelevant. Place, the distribution channel, is simply the Web, and Price
means ad revenue (see Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Part II for information about cashing
in with web content). The key issues a marketing plan should resolve are Product,
Promotion, and Positioning.
Promotion and Positioning of web content is primarily accomplished by advertising,
by optimizing your site for search engines, and by generating buzz (the online equivalent
of word of mouth).
So the five marketing Ps in the web content context boil down to only 3Ps. This sim-
plification of the process of creating a marketing plan is shown in Figure 2-2.
A marketing plan is created by placing your (hopefully compelling) business narrative
in the context of the basic elements of marketing. As opposed to an overall business
plan, a marketing plan doesn’t have to be an extensive or formal document. In partic-
ular, it shouldn’t include financial projections or spreadsheets (which are an important
element of a general business plan).
38 | Chapter 2: Creating Effective Marketing Plans

Figure 2-2. When you are creating your marketing plan for web content, you usually don’t have to
be concerned with pricing or distribution channels
The two most important aspects of a good marketing plan are to present a clear un-
derstanding of exactly who your customers are, and why they would, should, or could
be interested in your product. If you know the customer, and the reason for the cus-
tomer’s interest, you can usually figure out how to “connect the dots”—and get your
offering in front of your potential buyers.
How can you discover your target customer? There’s no exact science to it. Large busi-
nesses often employ focus groups for this purpose. But not only are focus groups ex-
pensive, they often yield results that are neither generally applicable nor useful. For
smaller enterprises that want some kind of analytical basis for making marketing de-
cisions, the survey is probably a more useful tool. Surveys can be used with existing
customers or potential customers. If properly designed, surveys can yield good data for
analysis and can help drive marketing decisions.
Services such as iContact and Constant Contact provide tools that can
help you design effective email surveys. In addition, by using one of
these services your surveys won’t get labeled as spam, and your survey
targets can use the opt-in and opt-out tools provided. This will keep you
in compliance with applicable laws and make your surveys feel more
user-friendly and professional to those who are interested in completing
them.
Whether or not you use tools like focus groups and surveys, the key issue is to under-
stand your customers and potential customers. If you can, talk to them and get to know
them. Think about them. Research competitive businesses and see how they position
themselves.
The two most important aspects of a plan for online marketing and publicity are:
• Understanding your target audience (or audiences)
• Creating a story (or stories) that will meet the needs of and intrigue your target
audience
Creating a Plan | 39

Creating a Checklist
Your plan should provide a checklist with specific “to do” items—essentially, all of the
techniques used to create online publicity described in this chapter. The list should also
include offline marketing and publicity placements appropriate to your target audience
and your story.
Successfully getting online publicity and generating traffic is largely a matter of focus
and keeping track of the details. Creating a checklist as part of your plan will help you
make sure that none of these details fall through the cracks.
When you get to the steps I suggest in Chapters 3 and 4 for publicizing your site and
improving its construction, you’ll see that many of these steps are essentially mechan-
ical. For example, once you have submitted a site to a variety of search engines, there
is no great difficulty in repeating the process.
Even so, you should have a plan for marketing your content sites. No brick-and-mortar
business in its right mind would attempt a marketing or publicity campaign without a
plan, and you shouldn’t proceed online without one either.
Having a plan will help you accomplish even the mechanical steps more effectively.
When you submit your site to a search engine or a directory, you will often be asked
for a description of your offering. Understanding your site in the context of a marketing
plan will help you hone a site description. If you already have your elevator pitch and
keyword list, you can use and reuse them—in site submissions, in meta code, in press
releases, and more. As minimum steps, you should:
• Understand who the ideal visitor to your site is
• Discover some interesting stories to tell about your website
• Make a checklist and plan for publicizing your site
Naming Your Site
An important part of marketing a web content site is naming the site. As one can learn
from ancient mythologies in almost any culture, there can be a great deal of power in
the selection of a name.
If you haven’t already picked a name for your website, try to select a name that helps
to tell your story. Good names, at least with a .com suffix, are hard to find these days.
It’s worth working hard to find the right name.
Since more and more site traffic is derived from search engine queries
(or search page advertising), arguably the domain name for a site is less
important than it used to be. It’s still a great plus to come up with a
memorable and relevant site name.
40 | Chapter 2: Creating Effective Marketing Plans

The Cult of Personality
Life written large with the cult of personality might well describe the times we live in.
At the time of this writing, Paris Hilton, an heiress with an apparently vacuous per-
sonality, has a television show and is famous because (and not despite) of that vacuous
personality. I think the reality is that Paris is a great deal smarter than she seems—
although another moral you can certainly draw from the Paris Hilton success story is
that sex sells.
My point is that people, particularly celebrities, get attention these days. If you have
celebrity, have access to celebrities, or have ideas about how to create celebrity, I say:
“Go for it! Milk it!” And don’t forget to mention your website.
It’s reasonable that people should be interested in people. People are interesting. As
the poet Alexander Pope said a long time ago, “The proper study of mankind is man.”
(If Pope had included both genders, we moderns could surely go along with this.)
It’s really very simple. Getting website traffic requires publicity. Publicity is best gen-
erated using stories about people—particularly interesting or notorious people. If your
website has an interesting story about people, let others know about it (perhaps using
a press release). Your people story will draw traffic.
Ideally, a site name, as I mentioned, should tell or evoke the story of your site and be
memorable. Consider these classics:
Amazon
The world’s greatest river meets the world’s largest inventory
eBay
Evokes an Internet port of trade, and perhaps even a new age of discovery
Google
A very big number fits with the very large quantity of information Google indexes
Introducing SEM
Search Engine Marketing, often referred to by the acronym SEM, means paying for ads
displayed by a search engine on a page of search query results. Google is essentially the
inventor of this kind of advertising on a wide scale (although not the first to deploy it)
and by far the largest player in the field.
In the Internet era, SEM is the key mechanism for driving marketing. Many SEM cam-
paigns are primarily designed to drive traffic to take a specific action (such as purchasing
a product). This means that these SEM campaigns are primarily related to the “Place”
component of the 5Ps of marketing. However, as SEM has matured, many businesses
are also realizing that SEM can be used in a broader fashion to drive perception and,
as such, fall under the “Position” component of marketing.
Introducing SEM | 41

Obviously, there are many kinds of paid advertising that go beyond getting your ads
to appear in response to a user entering specific search terms (see Chapter 14 for some
examples of advertising that don’t depend on search). However, by far the easiest and
most productive advertising on the Web is accomplished using SEM.
The predominant type of SEM ads is text only. The short block of text includes one or
more hyperlinks. The ads are paid for using a scheme called CPC, or cost per click.
With CPC, the advertiser agrees to pay for the ad only when the hyperlinks it contains
are actually clicked.
Getting the most from your marketing and advertising budget with SEM and CPC ads
is a complex and important topic. It is the primary subject of Part III of this book.
The most important SEM ads appear on search results pages, either on the top or the
right of the page. They are clearly denoted as advertisements. However, they are often
extremely well targeted. After all, they appear in response to a search query. The extent
of this targeting makes these ads very effective.
As you’ll see in Parts II and III of this book, if you use the Google AdWords program
to place SEM ads, you can also place ads on web content. Website owners have signed
up to host this advertising content and are paid a portion of the revenues. While this
kind of content ad is targeted, it’s not as effective as ads on search engine results pages
themselves (and therefore is not worth paying as much for).
Comparing SEO with SEM
The idea behind SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is that it makes sense to bypass
the whole idea of advertising. As I’ve noted, the most effective and targeted ads are
themselves on search results pages. So, why not simply arrange for them to be in search
results—and specifically somewhere at the top of the search results—returned for a
given query? Surely there’s more credibility in being within the top so-called natural
search results rather than paying for placement. After all, anyone can buy an ad. In
addition, more users tend to click on natural search listings than on ads. Taking these
factors into consideration, the goal of SEO is to appear high in natural search listings.
Studies have shown that most people go no further than the first three pages of search
results. Since Google defaults to 10 results per page, your goal should be to be within
the top 30 results for the search terms you target.
Of course, the first few search results get far and away the most clicks, so ideally you’d
want to be number five or above. However, this may not be realistic, depending upon
many factors—and a successful SEO campaign targets many different keywords and
phrases, with logical but differing expectations.
You should bear in mind that the traffic fall-off is steep. There’s a world of difference
from an SEO viewpoint of being in the top three as opposed to on the second page of
results.
42 | Chapter 2: Creating Effective Marketing Plans

Crafting the Blended Campaign
The goal of core SEO is to obtain high natural listings. As the world of search has grown,
however, the SEO discipline has also expanded. There used to be considerable stigma
associated with obviously paying for listings. Since Google has taken the high road and
labeled all paid content as advertising, there’s absolutely no stigma associated with paid
listings, particularly when using a program like AdWords that appropriately labels
content.
If paid listings help drive the traffic that you need in a cost-effective fashion, they should
be considered a valuable part of your extended SEO campaign management. In fact,
to generalize, SEM advertisements reinforce SEO natural listing placement. If a pros-
pect sees both an advertisement and a listing high in the search results for the same
product or company, that person is more than twice as likely to click one or the other.
Perhaps this is because the natural listing implies that the site being promoted has
genuinely relevant content, and the advertising link implies that a solid company (or
at least one with an advertising budget) is behind the site.
The ideal of the blended campaign should be to expose prospects to both advertise-
ments and natural search results. Paid advertising can reinforce search listings as I’ve
just explained. It can also extend the reach of a natural search engine ranking campaign
by using ad placement for terms or phrases that do not correspond to a high natural
result.

CHAPTER 3
Driving Traffic to a Website
The best way to get traffic to a website is to publish great content, sit back, and let word
of mouth spread the news. However, life is not always quite so simple. For one thing,
generating great content is not necessarily easy. And even great content can sometimes
use a head start so that it can really catch on.
Effective online strategies for driving traffic to a site fall into three general categories:
Promotional
Intended to build buzz and word of mouth
Technical
SEO activities intended to increase search engine visibility and rankings and drive
traffic via inbound links
Advertising
Such as the Google AdWords program explained in Part III of this book
The first two of these strategies fall under the general rubric of SEO (Search Engine
Optimization), whereas advertising with AdWords (explained in detail in Part III) is,
of course, SEM (Search Engine Marketing). I discussed crafting a campaign balance
between SEO and SEM in Chapter 2.
This chapter explains how to publicize your site and increase traffic using techniques
that do not cost money and do not involve tinkering with the HTML code or content
of your pages themselves.
What Price Popularity?
The three kinds of activities that drive traffic to a website have very different apparent
cost metrics:
• Promotional activities, discussed in this chapter, are largely free, although they do
take time and energy.
• Technical SEO activities, explained in Chapter 4, are also largely free of out-of-
pocket costs, although they do require technical expertise with websites.
45

• Advertising, covered in Part III, explicitly costs money; however, it is possible to
tie cost to performance.
The best advice is to use elements of all three approaches, if possible, in any effort to
drive traffic.
Submitting Your Sites to Search Engines
Google and most other search engines use several separate mechanisms:
• A program that crawls the Web to find sites, also called a crawler or a spider. Once
found (crawled), sites are placed in the search engine’s index.
• Software that ranks sites in the search engine’s index to determine their order of
delivery when someone uses Google to search for a particular keyword or phrase.
To start with, if your site hasn’t been found by a search engine, you won’t be ranked
at all. So the first task is getting your site into the systems of Google and other search
engines.
I do not recommend participating in any programs that ask you to pay
for search engine listings, regardless of whether these programs are run
by search engines themselves or by third parties. At best, these programs
do nothing you cannot do yourself, and at worst they are scams.
If you have inbound links—links to your site—from other sites in a search engine’s
index, then the search engine’s spider will find your site…eventually. But why not see
if you can speed up the process?
It’s peculiar but true: different search engines index different portions
of the Web. Also, at any given time, it is impossible for any search engine
index to include the entire Web because the Web is changing too fast!
The rub is that even by submitting a form to a search engine, there is no guarantee if,
or when, your site will be included by a given search engine. An easy approach is to list
your site using the search engine’s procedures, and check back in six months to see if
you are included in the search engine’s index. If not, submit again. In other words, this
is a process that requires patience and may produce limited results—but at least the
price is right!
Google re-indexes frequently, so a better way to get listed in Google is to find a page
that is already listed and get a link from it to your site.
Google is, of course, the single most important index. The good news about Google is
that the Googlebots (its crawlers) are hyperactive. If you put up a new site that has a
46 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

few inbound links from sites that are themselves at least somewhat linked-to, it is very
unlikely that you will have to wait long to be indexed. Note, however, that this presents
a cogent argument for arranging at least one or two inbound links before your site is
ready to go live.
Getting a site listed in an online categorized directory—particularly the
Open Directory Project (ODP) or Yahoo!’s directory, as I explain in
“Working with Directories” on page 57—is one of the most effective
ways to get included in the search engine indexes themselves.
To summarize, search engines find the web pages they index by using software to follow
links on the Web. Since the Web is huge, and always expanding and changing, it can
be a while before this software finds your particular site. Therefore, it’s smart to speed
up this process by manually submitting your site to search engines.
Important Search Engines for Submission
Table 3-1 shows some of the most important search engines to which you should submit
your site, along with the URL for each site’s submission page. Some search engines,
such 
as 
Ask.com, 
don’t 
have 
a 
submission 
page. 
Their 
attitude 
is
that you should prepare a site map (see “Taking Advantage of Site Map-
ping” on page 54), and they’ll get to your site when they get there. But the big three—
Google, Bing, and Yahoo!—each do have an explicit submission mechanism.
Table 3-1. Selected search engines and submission URLs
Search engine
Submission URL
Google
http://www.google.com/addurl/
Bing
http://www.bing.com/docs/submit.aspx
Yahoo!
http://search.yahoo.com/info/submit.html
Submission Tools
You may also want to use an automated site submission tool that submits your site to
multiple search engines in one fell swoop. If you have inbound links, your site will get
picked up automatically in any case, so site submission is not worth as much as it used
to be. But the price is right, so what the heck?
If you are hosting your web content offsite, your web hosting company may well provide
a utility with this functionality that you can use to submit the URLs for your hosted
domains to a group of search engines. Figure 3-1 shows the results of a site submission
using the tool provided by one web host (you’ll probably find that your web host pro-
vides something similar).
Submitting Your Sites to Search Engines | 47

Before using a site submission tool, you should prepare a short list of
keywords and a one- or two-sentence summary of your site as I
mentioned in “Telling a Story” on page 33 and “Creating a
Plan” on page 38 (you’ll be able to reuse the keywords and site summary
as keywords and description data in your meta tags). Alternatively, if you
have already created meta information for your site, as I explain in
Chapter 4, you can use the keywords and description in your meta
information for search engine submissions.
Figure 3-1. This web host utility lets you automatically submit your site to a number of search engines
at once
48 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

If the tool is provided by your web host, you will probably be able to
submit only your domain, rather than directories within the domain—
for example, http://www.digitalfieldguide.com but not http://www.digi
talfieldguide.com/blog/.
If you search Google with a phrase like “search engine submit,” you’ll find a few free
services that submit to a group of search sites for you. You’ll also find some search
engine submission services that cost money.
Typically, the free submission sites try to up-sell or cross-sell you on a product or
service, but since you don’t have to buy anything, why not take advantage of the free
service? The best-known example of this kind of site is Submit Express, which will
submit your URL to 40 sites for free (you’ll likely want to pass on the various offers
you’ll find on the site).
Working with Google
Google wants you to succeed. Successful content websites and pages represent adver-
tising target destinations. Creating new places for Google’s ads is important to Google
because it is a significant revenue source for Google. Unless you have millions of visitors
to your website, you probably will not receive personal advice from someone who
works for Google. But any site, no matter how big or small, can take advantage of
Google’s tools for webmasters.
The tools that Google makes available fall into four categories (Google tends to
describe “documentation” as a tool):
Automatic updating tools
Let you discover how Google sees your pages, and let you notify Google automat-
ically when there are changes
Find out how users are reaching your site
Provides report information about your inbound links, and how people are reach-
ing your site
Understand the query path
Provides information about exactly what queries drive users to your site, so you
can tweak your pages to get more traffic
Documentation at Webmaster Central
A knowledge base that includes a blog, help section, and often-updated FAQs
The best way to start taking advantage of these Google Webmaster Tools is to open
the Webmaster Central page, located at http://www.google.com/webmasters/ and
shown in Figure 3-2.
Working with Google | 49

Figure 3-2. Google provides a Webmaster Central page to help you navigate the Webmaster Tools
offerings
When you click the “Sign in to Webmaster Tools” button shown in Figure 3-2 and sign
in, the Webmaster Dashboard shown in Figure 3-3 opens.
Figure 3-3. The Google Webmaster Dashboard is used to launch Webmaster Tools
50 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

The Dashboard lists the sites associated with your user ID.
You may notice that you can report spam and paid links using this
interface. Google is essentially asking you to do its work for it, but a
cleaner, less spammy Web benefits everyone.
On the topic of paid links, of course Google is in the business of pro-
viding paid links all the time. There’s no reason you should not accept
paid advertising from parties other than Google on your site. However,
in the interest of both being fair with your site users and not angering
the Google Gods, it is important to mark the advertisements as such,
both visually (for humans) and in HTML code (for the Googlebots).
You’ll find more on this topic in Chapter 4.
To get the most out of the Webmaster Tools, you’ll need to verify your sites, which
means proving they are yours (or, more technically, that you at least have permission
from an owner or administrator with root level access). You verify a site in one of two
ways:
• Add a file to the home directory of your site named as Google instructs. Google
then scans for the file.
• Add a meta tag generated by Google to the header section of the index page of your
site, and then Google scans for the custom tag. (See Chapter 4 for more information
about meta tags.)
A site map is an XML guide to the pages and links in a website presented in a normalized
format. Although many of the Google Webmaster Tools are available without a site
map, to get the most out of the tools (as well as to improve your visibility in Google)
you’ll want to upload a site map as I explain a little later in this chapter.
It’s not particularly intuitive, but to get to the different sections of Webmaster Tools
for a site, click the site URL in the Google Dashboard (as shown in Figure 3-3). For
each URL, you’ll see a menu like that shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4. After clicking a link in the Dashboard, you get access to the Webmaster Tools on a per-
domain basis
Working with Google | 51

If you haven’t yet verified your site, you won’t see much in the Dashboard mode
(Figure 3-5), although Google will tell you if it is able to communicate with your home
page and if it’s been indexed.
Figure 3-5. To get the most out of the Webmaster Tools, you need to verify your site
Once your site is verified, in Dashboard mode you’ll be able to see web crawl errors,
as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6. Dashboard mode lets you know if the Googlebot found any errors while it was crawling
52 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

Clicking on the link for any of the web crawl errors found gives you specific information
about the location of the problem pages so that you can fix the error.
The tabs on the Dashboard control panel shown earlier in Figure 3-4 let you access
utilities and information as follows:
Site configuration
This tab lets you access web crawl information such as site maps, crawler access,
and restrictions to your site’s content. You can also change your domain address,
access general settings, and see any Google-generated sitelinks that will appear in
search results.
Your site on the web
This tab provides information about the top search queries that people use to find
your site, and shows you inbound links (Google calls these external links), cross
links (Google calls these internal links), and the most common keywords the Goo-
glebot sees when crawling your site. You can also get a detailed breakdown of
subscriber statistics.
Diagnostics
Any issues Google encounters when crawling your site will be listed under “Crawl
errors.” These stats show Googlebot activity during the last 90 days. In addition,
a new feature called “HTML suggestions” will highlight issues that may affect user
experience and performance, such as meta or title tags. A typical HTML sugges-
tions report is shown in Figure 3-7.
Figure 3-7. HTML suggestions tell you whether you need to work on your title and meta tags
Working with Google | 53

Labs
As Google rolls out new beta features to assist webmasters, they will first appear
here. For example, the “Fetch as Googlebot” and “Malware details” tools provide
more information if any issues are detected on your site.
Google Webmaster Central provides an easy way to access the full suite
of Google Webmaster Tools, as well as Google Webmaster documen-
tation including the Google Webmaster Blog, Help Center, and Dis-
cussion Group.
Taking Advantage of Site Mapping
Simply put, site maps are a list of the pages on your site. There are two kinds of site
maps: those that humans can use to navigate a site, and encoded site maps for the use
of web bots and crawlers.
Google encourages webmasters to create the second kind of site map, which is written
in XML. If you have this kind of site map registered with Google, your site will likely
be more fully and quickly indexed, and changes to your site will be noticed more
frequently.
Sites with certain characteristics will benefit from site mapping. Here are the kinds of
sites that will benefit the most from mapping (although there is no downside, so site
mapping is something all sites should do):
• Sites with dynamic content
• Sites that have pages that the Googlebot can’t easily crawl and process—for ex-
ample, pages featuring AJAX or Flash
• New sites with few inbound links (the Googlebot crawls the Web by following
links from one page to another, so it may be hard for Google to discover your site
if it isn’t well linked)
• Sites with a large archive of content pages that are not well linked to each other or
are not linked at all
To get mileage with Google, the site map should conform to the standards set by
Sitemaps.org. At the time of this writing, the current version of the standard is Sitemap
Protocol version 0.9, with the specifications found at http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol
.php.
For example, here’s a sample site map containing one URL (and one page):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
   <url>
    <loc>http://www.digitalfieldguide.com/</loc>
   <lastmod>2009-01-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
54 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

   </url>  
</urlset>
If your eyes start to glaze over at the beginning of a discussion of XML schema and the
fine points of a specific protocol, fear not. There are automated tools, many of them
free, that can do it for you, and you don’t really need to know much about how site
maps work to take advantage of the concept.
To use site mapping while only maintaining a bare nod to the technical side of what is
involved, pick one of the site mapping programs suggested by Google at http://code
.google.com/p/sitemap-generators/wiki/SitemapGenerators. Many of these programs are
free; if there is a fee, it is indicated on the page with a dollar sign ($) next to the link for
the software.
For example, GSiteCrawler is software on the Google-approved list that is currently
available for free download on the Windows platform. You download it to your Win-
dows desktop and start the New Site Wizard shown in Figure 3-8.
Figure 3-8. You’ll need to enter some straightforward information before the software can begin
crawling your site in order to generate a site map
Taking Advantage of Site Mapping | 55

Once you’ve entered basic information, the New Site Wizard crawls your site to gen-
erate the site map as shown in Figure 3-9. This is a process that can take hours if your
site is extensive.
Once your site has been completely crawled, you’ll need to generate the site map file
as shown in Figure 3-10. Save the site map file to your local computer, and then transfer
it to the root directory of your website. The FTP transfer is generally accomplished
using FTP software, such as Fetch for the Mac or WS_FTP for Windows.
You can generate a site map for Yahoo! at the same time the Google site
map is created.
Figure 3-9. Each page is considered when the software crawls a site to create a site map
Once your site map has been uploaded to the root directory of your website, you can
point Google to it using the Webmaster Dashboard (shown in Figure 3-4) and clicking
on the “Site configuration” link and choosing the Sitemaps tab. You will need to be
verified in relation to the website.
56 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

In the Sitemaps window, shown in Figure 3-11, enter the name of your site map and
click Submit.
Figure 3-11. Once the site map file is in the root directory of your website, you can submit it to Google
Working with Directories
It’s a not-so-well-kept secret that one of the best approaches for getting better rankings
in the search engine listings is to enter through a back door by working with the two
most important structured directories: the Open Directory Project (ODP) and the
Yahoo! Directory.
Working with Directories | 57

Understanding Taxonomies
A directory differs from the index used by a search engine because a directory uses a
structured way to categorize sites, sometimes called a taxonomy. In addition, sites are
included in a particular category in the ODP and Yahoo! directories only after they have
been reviewed by human editors. You can search within directories (just as you can
search in a web index such as the one compiled by Google). But it’s common to use a
directory by following its taxonomy, drilling down through subjects to find what you
want. For example, suppose you wanted to find resources related to alternative photo
processes, such as creating daguerreotypes (a nineteenth-century print technology).
Using the Open Directory taxonomy, shown in Figure 3-12, you would drill down
through the categories Arts→Photography→Techniques and Styles to find topics in-
cluding Alternative Processes.
You can think of the index of the Web compiled by search engines such
as Google as being like the index of a nonfiction book. In contrast, a
taxonomic directory is much more like the table of contents for the
book: it is organized according to the book’s structure, and you can drill
down by part, chapter (within the part), heading (within the chapter),
and subtopic to find the information you need.
Getting Open Directory Project Listings
The Open Directory Project (ODP) is the most important taxonomic directory on the
Web. Formally hosted and administered by the Netscape division of AOL, the ODP is
run along the lines of an open source project and is inspired by the Debian Social
Contract.
The credo behind the ODP is that “humans do it better.” The ODP believes that web
automated search is ineffective and getting worse, and that the small contingent of paid
editors at commercial web search engine companies cannot keep up with the staggering
rate of change on the Web—decaying, stagnant sites; link rot; new sites; sites intended
as search spam; and so on.
The ODP is run and maintained by a vast army of volunteer editors. These editors
follow internal checks and balances to preserve the integrity of the directory. See http:
//dmoz.org/guidelines/ for more information about the ODP review process and guide-
lines for site inclusion.
You, too, can become an ODP editor in an area of your interest and
expertise. See http://dmoz.org/help/become.html for more information
about becoming an ODP editor.
58 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

The ODP taxonomy (categorization system) and the sites included in the categories are
freely available as data for use by anyone who wants to run his own search engine, as
long as the terms of the ODP’s free-use license are complied with. (For terms of the
license, in case you want to use the ODP data in a search engine of your own, see http:
//dmoz.org/license.html.)
Google and most of the major search engines do use information derived from the ODP,
but they use it in their own way. Google in particular uses information from the ODP
to form one of the less well-known facets of Google, the Google Directory.
Google uses its own search technology for searches within the Google
Directory and, in this way, differs from the ODP.
Figure 3-12. You can find “Alternative Processes” and related photographic topics by drilling down
through Arts, Photography, and Techniques and Styles
Working with Directories | 59

Most significantly, inclusion within an ODP category means that your site will very
likely be included within the Google web index (as well as the Google Directory and
in other major web indexes).
So, it’s worth submitting your site to the ODP if only because it’s the best way to get
indexed (and appropriately categorized) by Google. You’ll find a FAQ about how to
add your site at http://www.dmoz.org/add.html (this FAQ is also available via a link
from the ODP home page).
The first step is to locate the best category for your site. For example, suppose you have
a site like the Photogram area of http://www.digitalfieldguide.com (Figure 3-13), whose
purpose is to display images created using an alternative photographic process.
Figure 3-13. The Photoblog 2.0 Photogram archive might fit in the alternative processes category on
the ODP
60 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

The best category on the ODP I can find for this site is the category I’ve already shown,
Arts→Photography→Techniques and Styles→Alternative Processes. The category page
is shown in Figure 3-14.
Figure 3-14. Click “suggest URL” to start the process of requesting an addition to an ODP category
You can start looking for the right category (to get close to the best
possible category) using a search term—for example, “photogram.”
On the category page that you think is best for your site, click the “suggest URL” link,
shown at the top of Figure 3-14.
This will open the “Submit a Site to the Open Directory” page, where you will be asked
to verify the category you selected (as determined by the page from which you clicked
“suggest URL”). You’ll need to enter your site’s URL, title, a brief site description, and
your email address. As the editors note, “A well-written, objective description will make
listing your site easier.”
When your listing page is complete, click Submit. The process is now complete, except
for the waiting. You should check from time to time to see if you’ve been listed.
If I make it sound like you might have to wait a long time to get listed
in the ODP, well, you might! The ODP depends on volunteer labor, and
rumor is that it is getting slower and slower. However, inclusion in the
ODP is a virtual guarantee of inclusion in many search engine indexes
and other directories. So have patience! The ODP is worth it.
Working with Directories | 61

Getting Yahoo! Directory Listings
The Yahoo! Directory, a somewhat lesser-known part of Yahoo!, works in pretty much
the same way as the ODP, except that it is privately maintained. Sites added to the
Yahoo! Directory tend to end up in the Yahoo! index as well as other important search
indexes.
To suggest your site for inclusion in the Yahoo! Directory, open the Yahoo! Directory’s
home page, shown in Figure 3-15.
Figure 3-15. Yahoo! Directory is not Yahoo!; here’s the Yahoo! Directory home page
You can also find the Yahoo! Directory by opening the main Yahoo!
home page, selecting Directory as your search category, and searching
for a term. The search results you will be presented with are from the
Yahoo! Directory (not the Yahoo! web index), and the display will show
where you are in the taxonomy, so you can browse through related
categories.
62 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

Next, find the best category for your site, either by drilling down through the Yahoo!
Directory taxonomy, shown on the left of Figure 3-15, or by searching within the Yahoo!
Directory, using the search box shown at the top of Figure 3-15.
You can use directory search results as the starting place for pinpointing
the perfect category.
When you find the right category page (for example, for a digital photography site, the
category page for Directory→Arts→Visual Arts→Photography Digital), click the Suggest
a Site link shown on the bottom right in Figure 3-16.
Figure 3-16. From the appropriate category page, click the Suggest a Site link to propose your site for
inclusion in the Yahoo! Directory
Clicking the Suggest a Site link starts the site submission process. You’ll first be asked
if you want to pay for inclusion or continue for free (for noncommercial sites). You’ll
have to decide for yourself whether the fee is worth inclusion.
The next step is to verify that the site you want to suggest does not already appear in
the Yahoo! Directory. This is verified using a Yahoo! Directory search. If your site
cannot be found, you can continue.
You’ll be asked to verify the listing category and to log in with your Yahoo! username.
(If you don’t have a Yahoo! account, you’ll need to create one.) Finally, you can com-
plete the form with information about your site, shown in Figure 3-17, and submit.
Keep track of the email address you supply in the Yahoo! Directory
Suggest a Site form. You’ll need that address to change information
about any of your sites listed in the directory.
Becoming Popular by Generating Inbound Links
Sometimes it seems like all of life has the same theme as high school: what’s important
is being popular. A significant measure of popularity on the Web is how many
inbound links—links from other sites to your site—you have.
Becoming Popular by Generating Inbound Links | 63

Inbound links are an important component of Google’s PageRank sys-
tem, which is the way it orders the sites returned from a search. Google
sometimes calls inbound links external links, although this is slightly
confusing terminology. While it excludes cross links, called internal
links in Google-speak, it fails to differentiate between inbound and out-
bound links.
Obtaining inbound links is not rocket science, but it is labor-intensive and does require
some thought. An effective (but not always easy) way to get another site to link to your
site is to ask for it, as obvious as that may seem.
Link farms—sites that exist for the sole purpose of providing inbound
links to better a page’s search ranking—will not help your site become
more popular and may in fact damage your standing with Google and
other search engines.
It makes sense for sites to link to your site when they have similar or related content—
always assuming the webmaster in charge of the site linking to you likes your content.
This is a reasonable thing for the webmaster in charge of the other site to do, because
Figure 3-17. You should provide a brief description of your site, along the lines of the elevator pitch
described in Chapter 2
64 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

it adds value for the other site’s visitors. (If your site is not adding value, you might
want to rethink its premise.)
The Best Inbound Links
The best—meaning most likely to drive traffic—inbound links come from:
• Sites that publish content that is complementary and related to the content on your
site.
• Hub sites that are a central repository, discussion area, or community site for a
particular interest group. For example, a mention on Slashdot or Digg can drive
huge amounts of traffic to sites.
Finding Sites to Make a Link Request
To find sites that are appropriate for an inbound link request, you should:
• Consider the sites you find useful, entertaining, and informative
• Use the web taxonomic directories to find sites in your category and in related
categories (see “Working with Directories” on page 57)
• Use specialized searching syntax to find the universe of sites that search engines
such as Google regard as “related” to yours
If you’ve looked carefully at Google search results, you may have noticed a Similar Pages
link (Figure 3-18).
Figure 3-18. You can use the Google Similar Pages link to find sites that might be interested in linking
to yours (because they are like yours)
The Similar Pages link is supposed to show you more pages like the one the link modi-
fies. How well it works varies widely (it works better on popular, highly ranked pages
and less well on obscure pages). But it can give you some leads.
You can bypass the process of clicking Similar Pages by using the Google related:
operator followed by a URL directly in a Google search. For example, entering the
following Google search:
related:www.digitalfieldguide.com
is comparable to clicking the Similar Pages link for http://www.digitalfieldguide.com,
and shows exactly the same web pages as the search result.
Becoming Popular by Generating Inbound Links | 65

Six Degrees of Separation
Sometimes you need to iterate the process of finding similar sites. If your first try at
finding similar sites generates only a few leads, try expanding several of these initially
similar sites to show sites similar to them to get a greater pool of similar sites. One
wonders: if you keep on iterating ad infinitum, do you get all websites, or are there only
six degrees of separation?
If you find it easier to analyze data presented visually, a demonstration tool called
Google-enabled Visual Search, provided free by i2 Software, may be right for you.
Google-enabled Visual Search uses the Google Web APIs to (among other things)
present a visual representation of sites similar to yours. For example, Figure 3-19 shows
a visual representation of sites that are similar or linked to http://www.digitalfieldguide
.com.
The Google-enabled Visual Search Tool will show similar sites, linked
sites, or both. This is demonstration software produced by a company
whose primary business is to provide data visualization tools for the
military.
Making the Link Request
Email is the best way (and sometimes the only way) to request an inbound link to your
site.
Finding email addresses
The first step in writing an email requesting an inbound link is to find the email address
of the webmaster you want to contact. This can take quite a bit of poking around, but
it is amazing how often you can uncover the right email address with a bit of persistence
if you just look at all the pages on a website.
If a website has a contact form but no explicit email address, you can
often find the email address the contact form is mailed to by viewing the
HTML source code for the contact form’s page. Another place to look
for email addresses is within a syndication feed. If the site provides an
RSS or Atom feed, the creator’s email address is often included as part
of the feed.
As you may know, you can use the Whois service of Internet domain registrars to find
contact information for site owners, although with multiple domain registrars, this
information is more fragmentary than it used to be. In addition, some sites intentionally
66 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

do not publish information about the real domain owners when they register
domains—for example, by entering the domain as the name of the web host.
A good first stop if you want to try using a Whois service to get email contact infor-
mation is Network Solutions, the “classic” Internet domain name registrar. Next, try
Whois.net, which has one of the largest databases for Whois information.
If these two sources fail, do not give up! Go to Internic. The Internic service will not
give you contact information, but it probably will tell you the specific domain registrar
who registered a given site and the address of the domain registrar’s Whois server. You
can then go to the Whois server maintained by the appropriate registrar and usually
find email contact information there.
If this sounds time-consuming, well, it is. To justify the time, make sure that any sites
you contact are indeed related to your site.
Emails should not be spam
Generally, you should not send email that reads like spam. Don’t send mass emailings
requesting links; such messages will probably get intercepted and marked for
Figure 3-19. If you prefer to analyze data visually, the Google-enabled Visual Search Tool may be
for you
Becoming Popular by Generating Inbound Links | 67

deletion by anti-spam filters. Personalize each email with the recipient’s name, some-
thing about her site, and information about why she should link with you.
It’s OK to offer a reciprocal link in exchange for your inbound link. But I think the
classier approach is to already have a link to any site you approach. You can set aside
a resource page on your site for this purpose. Why bother trying to get an inbound link
from a site that isn’t worth linking to? If it is worth linking to, go ahead and do it on
your own without requiring payback. You’ll be surprised at how often the other web-
master decides to reciprocate.
Comments, Trackbacks, and Discussion Threads
The “cheap date” way to get inbound links is to post them yourself using a mechanism
such as a blog comment, a blog trackback, or a discussion thread. These links do not
have the permanence or credibility of a link from a stable site, but they can draw con-
siderable short-term traffic if posted on a popular site.
There’s nothing wrong with adding a link to a comment on a blog, in a discussion
thread, or using a trackback mechanism, provided you have a valid hook for hanging
your URL. In other words, it’s OK to enter a discussion if you really have something
to say, and it’s also OK to link back to relevant material on your site, but don’t come
completely from left field. It will undermine the credibility that you are trying to build
for your site.
The Power of the Press Release
It used to be that putting out a press release was a big deal. It required special accred-
itation and membership in a wire service and could generally only be accomplished by
large companies or by using an accredited public relations or ad agency.
As with many other things, the Web has disintermediated and democratized the process
of publishing a press release—so much so that some large organizations don’t even
bother with them anymore, figuring that their releases will be lost in the flood of
information unleashed on the world by the “little guys.”
These days, publishing a press release that will be picked up by wire services is tech-
nically free. In reality, getting the distribution you want for the release will cost you
about $30 per release. Although my general stance is not to pay for listings, this is
usually well worth doing, provided you have the skills to write a good press release and
you have an interesting story to tell. Not only will it produce inbound links, but some
traditional media may pick up on your site and story.
There are several online services that exist to distribute press releases, including
24-7PressRelease.com, FreePressRelease.com, and PRWeb. These sites all work in es-
sentially the same way: an online form is provided for your press release submission,
and the service submits your release to wire services, web search engines, and anyone
68 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

who subscribes to the service’s feeds. Free submission is available from all of the press
release services, but to get the distribution your press release deserves, you need to buy
premium membership in the service (or upgrades for specific press releases). In some
cases, this is phrased as making a “contribution” or a “donation.”
PRWeb is probably the best known of these services. To get started with PRWeb, you
need to create a free account. Once you’ve established an account, you have access to
a management console, shown in Figure 3-20, which lets you create, edit, and submit
press releases and also check how many times each of your releases was viewed.
Figure 3-20. Drop-down menus in the PRWeb management console give you access to press release
creation, editing, and submission and allow you to monitor release statistics
The viewing statistics for PRWeb are impressive, typically in the tens of
thousands of views for most press releases. PRWeb also tells you how
many times your release was picked up by a media outlet, how many
times it was forwarded using PRWeb’s forwarding service, and how
many times it was printed using the printer-friendly version of your re-
lease. However, it’s not entirely clear what these statistics actually mean,
and you should not necessarily expect a corresponding increase in your
volume of site traffic.
The Power of the Press Release | 69

To create a new release for submission, click the Create Release button on the console.
In the form that opens, you can copy and paste the elements of your press release if you
created it as a word processing document (see the upcoming sidebar “Preparing a Press
Release”).
You can edit the press release later, but you do need to supply the following elements
initially:
• Headline (one sentence)
• Summary (two to four sentences)
• Body of the press release
• Keywords (it’s not a good idea to add a special keyword section in the body of the
release; instead, make sure that all the keywords appear as part of the text of the
release)
• Industry
• Site URL and contact information
Preparing a Press Release
Before you go online to submit a press release, you should prepare the press release
using a word processing program such as Microsoft Word. It’s important that you get
your release reviewed by several people, including (if possible) a professional writer or
editor. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation do count; if your press release is deficient
in these areas, it will look amateurish.
A good press release should be succinct. Keep it to one page if at all possible.
The press release should start with a summary of no more than two or three sentences.
You should also prepare a single, short sentence to serve as the headline for the release.
Next, the press release should tell a story in several paragraphs (see “Creating a
Plan” on page 38). If possible, you should include interesting quotations from one or
two people related to the story. (If no one else comes to mind, how about quoting
yourself?)
A final short paragraph should describe your website and include links to a FAQ page
and related sites. This paragraph can be used as a slug, which means it can be copied
and pasted for use in all your press releases related to your website.
The press release should provide email and phone contact information in case someone
who reads the release wants further information. Don’t make it hard to find you!
A press release created in this way can easily be copied and pasted into online submis-
sion forms.
70 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

To some degree, your industry selection determines to whom your press
release is distributed. You need to pick a primary industry when you
create the release, but (depending on your contribution level) you can
add industry groups after the release has been saved but before it is
submitted. You should take advantage of this to get your release as
widely distributed as possible.
When you’ve completed your press release and assigned a release date, click Save Press
Release. You’ll next be asked to pay for your submission (select a contribution level).
Press releases are subject to a vetting process conducted both by software and human
editors. Some kinds of content are forbidden. For example, you cannot submit a press
release having to do with adult content and related industries on PRWeb.
You can find out more about PRWeb’s review policies using the knowledge base on
the PRWeb site. Generally, besides adult content, PRWeb will reject any outright and
apparent advertisements, so take care to word your press releases to avoid this stigma-
tization. If your press release is rejected, PRWeb will refund any contributions as a
matter of course. Note that PRWeb does not vet spelling or grammar and does not
check facts—it’s up to you to get these things right.
Provided your press release has been accepted, you’ll receive email confirmation and a
link to your press release online on the wire service site.
For a fee, PRWeb and other comparable newswire services will write or
edit your press release for you.
Unleashing Your Inner Blogger
Some people blog for fun, and some blog for profit. Whichever the case, blogging serves
to drive traffic to your site, provided the content of the blog stories has some merit.
People like to read blogs because they can provide opinionated and topical information.
Blog content that is part of a home page, or prominently connected to the main parts
of a site, helps propel ranking in a search engine because it adds new content and
changes often.
Although blogs may seem simple, they are actually reasonably complex database-driven
applications. The most commonly used blogging software on the Web are
WordPress and Six Apart’s Movable Type.
You can install blogging software on your own web server or you can contract for a
hosted blog environment (discussed shortly). For those running their own server-side
blogging installations, Movable Type, a commercial product, is most often used in
Unleashing Your Inner Blogger | 71

situations where there are multiple authors on a single blog—for example, the O’Reilly
Digital Media site, shown in Figure 3-21.
Figure 3-21. Blogs with multiple authors like the O’Reilly Digital Media site often run on Movable
Type software from Six Apart
In contrast to Six Apart’s commercial software, a vibrant open source community has
created WordPress using PHP, a web scripting language. The community nature of
WordPress turns out to be both a strength and a weakness: it is elegant software that
is full-featured and certainly priced right, but it’s also subject to a great deal of malicious
software attacks. Currently, WordPress is the single biggest server-side target of mal-
ware. Safely administering a WordPress installation requires a fair amount of commit-
ment and know-how.
72 | Chapter 3: Driving Traffic to a Website

If you don’t want to get involved with the intricacies of hosting your own blogging
software, there are many hosting services that will do this for you. Here are some
options:
TypePad
TypePad is a service run by Six Apart that will host your Movable Type blog for a
fee.
WordPress hosting
The WordPress organization will host a free blog at a domain like yourblog.word-
press.org. If you need more full hosting services, WordPress recommends com-
mercial hosting providers at http://wordpress.org/hosting/.
Blogger
Blogger, owned by Google, provides free blogs at domains like yourblog.blog-
spot.com.
The bottom line is that you can get a free, hosted blog, but it won’t integrate with your
site (and therefore won’t be as effective in driving traffic to your site). The greater the
complexity of your particular website, the more you’ll need customized blogging soft-
ware installations. Thus, those with appropriate knowledge or staffing will likely want
to host their own.
However you manage the software side of things, run—don’t walk—to integrate blog-
ging as an effective way to draw traffic to your site.
Using Syndication Feeds to Your Benefit
As you may know, syndication is a simple XML-based mechanism for publishing con-
tent. Syndication feeds come in two predominant flavors: RSS and Atom. From the
viewpoint of publicizing your website, you don’t need to worry about the differences
between them.
Content is syndicated by encoding it within an RSS or Atom feed. This feed can—and
usually does—include links to the site originating the content.
Subscribers can view syndication feeds in all different kinds of software, including web
browsers, email clients, standalone programs, and on HTML web pages. There’s no
mechanism built into syndication to pay for subscriptions, but once you are subscribed,
your feed display is automatically updated when a new item is added to the feed. It’s
up to the syndication-viewing software to decide how to render feeds, but software that
can display web pages often shows the underlying pages to which the feed links.
There’s some controversy about how publishers can best use syndication feeds, since
it’s not obvious how to make money from them. (Google has introduced a program
allowing publishers to insert contextual ads within syndication feeds, but this is a con-
troversial step.)
Using Syndication Feeds to Your Benefit | 73

However, syndication feeds work well as a device for driving traffic to a site because:
• Feed content is under the control of the publisher.
• Most feeds contain items that are thematically linked (and can be related to a site).
• Feed items provide content along with links back to more content on a publisher’s
site.
• It’s easy to distribute a syndication feed.
In other words, many savvy web publishers use syndication feeds as a kind of teaser
for their real web content.
Creating Feeds
If you maintain a blog, it’s likely that you are already publishing a syndication feed
(whether or not you are aware of it). Check your blog templates to see if there is a
template for an index.xml, index.rdf, or atom.xml file. If so, have a look at the root
directory for your blog. Voila! You’ll probably find a syndication feed. You may want
to tweak the template tags to make sure that you are syndicating the content you want,
and only the content you want.
Once you’ve syndicated content, anyone can use it and even build a
website of their own around your content, and there’s not much you
can do about it.
If you don’t have a blog feed, or want to publish content other than the entries of your
blog, it’s easy to construct an XML syndication feed by hand using a text editor. For
example, here’s a portion of an RSS syndication feed I created by hand:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rss version="2.0">
    <channel>
        <title>Featured Feed</title>
        <link>http://www.feedly.com/</link>
        <description>Featured feeds - Editor choice best of the best

The key thing to notice about this feed is that it consists of items. You can tell because
each one is wrapped in <item></item> tags. Within the item, you’ll find some kind of
description and/or content and a link to the full content provided by the item, as in-
dicated by tags such as <description> and <link>.
You can see that it isn’t very hard to create syndication feeds manually just by mim-
icking the form of the thing and adding your own data as items with links. But this will
quickly get cumbersome if you are creating feeds that get updated frequently.
Fortunately, there are also a great many tools available to help you construct your own
feeds. Some tools use a Wizard interface, so you don’t need to know anything about
coding in XML to create a syndication feed.
You’ll find links to these tools and to syndication resources in general on the RSS Com
pendium and on O’Reilly’s Xml.com site.
Telling the World About Your Feed
Once you have your syndication feed, the key to getting some bang out of it is to get it
distributed. As with a website, in the long run this requires constant addition of fresh
content. You probably should not try to distribute a syndication feed until you have a
minimum of a dozen entry items and can reasonably expect to add at least an item a
week.
You can (and should) mark your website with a graphic that is linked to your syndi-
cation feed. To create the graphic, you can create a button using FeedForAll’s free RSS
Graphics Tool, or you can grab a premade button from RSS Specifications.
Using Syndication Feeds to Your Benefit | 75

You also need to add code into the head section of your HTML pages to let syndication
viewers and aggregators automatically know about your feed. For example, if you in-
clude this code in a page, when someone visits your site using a web browser that is
capable of displaying syndication, such as Firefox, it will automatically offer to sub-
scribe to the feed.
The general form of the code to be added is:
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="RSS" href="http://
www.yourdomain.com/rss.xml>
Obviously, you need to specify the actual location of your own feed when you add this
code to the head section of your HTML page. For example, I maintain a syndication
feed for Photoblog 2.0 at http://www.digitalfieldguide.com/blog/feed/. The link code
added to my page looks like this:
<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Photoblog 2.0 RSS Feed"
href="http://www.digitalfieldguide.com/blog/feed" />
Typically, your blogging software will take care of actually adding the
feed link code for you.
Submitting Feeds
The next step is to submit your syndication feed to syndication aggregators and search
engines. The RSS Compendium provides a great list of sites for submitting syndication
feeds for inclusion at http://allrss.com/rsssubmission.html. The RSS Specifications site
also has an extensive list of sites that maintain syndication feed databases at http://www
.rss-specifications.com/rss-submission.htm. FeedBurner, owned by Google, has some
great tools for distributing and submitting feeds.
It’s a good idea to continue to submit your feeds as you add content items. Particularly
if you are publishing multiple feeds, this can become an unpleasant chore. RSS Submit
is a tool that automates this process. Shown in Figure 3-22, RSS Submit is available for
download at http://www.dummysoftware.com/rsssubmit.html in an evaluation version
or (with free updates) for about $35.
The updates to RSS Submit add new syndication indexes as they come
online and make sure the submission pages for older feeds stay
accurate.

Creating Email Lists and Surmounting the Spam Problem
Although they sometimes seem a little old fashioned, email lists can be a great mech-
anism for increasing interest in your websites over time. It’s fair to say that in the long
run, all successful websites include an email component in their marketing plans to
drive traffic. These emails can be informal, but increasingly they take the form of email
newsletters.
The rise of spam email, the creation of increasingly stringent spam filters, and certain
legislation related to spam email means that marketing email can no longer be consid-
ered a do-it-yourself proposition. Apart from legal issues, if you start sending bulk
emails from the mail server associated with your website, many will not go through,
and you are likely to be blacklisted by major ISPs (Internet Service Providers).
Federal anti-spam legislation is complex, but the essential requirements
are that recipients of commercial email must consent to be added to
your list in the first place, that an easy opt-out provision must be pro-
vided, and that your emails must include your identification and phys-
ical address.
Figure 3-22. RSS Submit automates the process of syndication feed submission
Creating Email Lists and Surmounting the Spam Problem | 77

So, what’s the solution? First and foremost, you should ensure that any email you send
out doesn’t walk like spam, look like spam, or quack like spam. If it has even a hint of
spam about it, at least some recipients will regard it as such—and will be offended.
Make sure everyone on your email list wants to be there and can easily unsubscribe.
Keep your emails topical, interesting, and give value beyond the blatantly commercial.
The easiest way to implement email marketing is to use a service. The top email mar-
keting providers to small and medium-sized enterprises are Constant Contact and
iContact, with minimum monthly charges of $10 to $15.
Besides basic email management, these services provide some important functionality,
including:
• Tools for creating attractive HTML email newsletters
• Tracking, so you know which recipients click on which links in your email

CHAPTER 4
Nuts and Bolts of SEO
SEO—short for Search Engine Optimization—is the set of techniques used to drive
web traffic to websites. These techniques include optimization of the code, content,
and organization of a site. While some SEO strategies do involve paying for inbound
links, generally SEO is considered to exclude advertising.
Advertising on search engines is thought of as Search Engine Marketing
(SEM). SEO campaigns should often be used in tandem with SEM as I
explain in Chapter 2. Advertising programs, such as Google AdWords
(see Part III), can very effectively generate traffic via ads placed on web
pages as well as on search engine result pages.
Most web businesses need traffic to succeed. Some websites depend on broad, general
traffic. These businesses need hundreds of thousands or millions of visitors per day to
prosper and thrive.
Other web businesses are looking for high-quality, targeted traffic. This traffic is es-
sentially like a prequalified sales prospect—they are already looking for and interested
in your offering.
This chapter tells you what you need to know, and explains the tools you’ll use, to draw
more traffic to your site. Google is by far the most important search engine, so most
SEO targets Google (but what works for Google also works for the other search en-
gines). You’ll learn how to effectively use PageRank and Google itself. Effective use of
SEO means understanding how Google works, how to boost placement in Google
search results, and how not to offend Google. You’ll also learn how to best organize
your web pages and websites, apply SEO analysis tools, establish effective SEO best
practices, and more.
When you approach SEO, make sure you’ve worked through the analysis I suggested
in Chapter 2 to understand the characteristics of the traffic that you need. Then use the
techniques explained in this chapter to boost your traffic—and your business.

SEO’s Evolution
Originally fairly narrowly conceived as a set of techniques for rising to the top of search
engine listings, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has conceptually expanded to
include all possible ways of promoting web traffic.
Learning how to construct websites, web content, and pages to improve—and not
harm—the search engine placement of those websites and web pages has become a key
component in the evolution of SEO. This central goal of SEO is sometimes called
core SEO, as opposed to broader, noncore, web traffic campaigns, which may include
lobbying and paying for links.
Effective SEO requires understanding that there needs to be a balance between attract-
ing search engines and interesting human visitors. One without the other does not
succeed. There must be balance between the yin of the search bot and the yang of the
real human site visitor.
The basics of SEO involve these steps:
• Understanding how your pages are viewed by search engine software
• Creating content that is attractive to the search engine indexing
• Taking common-sense steps to make sure that the way your pages are coded is
optimized from the viewpoint of these search engines
Fortunately, this often means practicing good design, which makes your
sites easy to use for human visitors as well. In addition, software is be-
coming available that automates the nuts and bolts of SEO page coding.
For example, you can optimize the HTML tagging of a WordPress blog
for SEO using the All-in-One SEO plug-in.
• Organizing your site in a way that makes sense to the search engine index
• Avoiding some overaggressive SEO practices that can get your site blacklisted by
the search engines
Search engine placement means where a web page appears in an ordered list of search
query results. It’s obviously better for pages to appear higher up and toward the be-
ginning of the list returned by the search engine in response to a user’s query.
Not all queries are created equal, so part of effective SEO is to understand which queries
matter to a specific website. It’s relatively easy to be the first search result returned for
a query that nobody else cares about. On the other hand, it’s very tough to become a
top-ranking response to a topical and popular search query that reflects the interest of
millions of people (and has a corresponding number of search results all competing for
visibility).
82 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Clearly, driving traffic to a website can make the difference between commercial success
and failure. SEO experts have come to look at search engine placement as only one of
their tools—and to look at the broader context of web technologies and business
mechanisms that help create and drive traffic.
SEO has become an advertising discipline that must be measured using the metrics of
cost effectiveness that are applied to all advertising techniques.
The SEO Advantage
If you understand SEO, you have an edge. It pays to nurture this understanding—
whether you are coding your web pages yourself, working with in-house developers,
or outsourcing your web design and implementation.
There may be some sites that do just fine without consciously considering SEO. But by
intentionally developing a plan that incorporates SEO into your websites and web
pages, your web properties will outrank others that do not.
Just as success begets success in the brick-and-mortar world, online traffic begets traffic.
What you plan to do with the traffic, and how you plan to monetize it, are other issues.
Making money with web content is considered in Chapters 5 and 6.
One way to look at this is that sites that use core SEO have an incrementally higher
ranking in search results. These sites don’t make gauche mistakes that cost them points
in search engine ranking. They use tried-and-true SEO techniques to gain points for
each web page.
Page by page, these increments give you an edge.
This edge is your SEO advantage.
What SEO Can (and Cannot) Do
SEO can drive more traffic to your website. If you plan carefully, you can also affect
the kind and quality of traffic driven to your site. This means that you need to consider
SEO as part of your general market research and business plan, as explained in Chap-
ter 2. Sure, most businesses want traffic—but not just any traffic. Just as the goal of a
brick-and-mortar business is to have qualified customers—ones with money in their
pocket who are ready to buy when they walk in the door—an online business wants
qualified traffic.
Qualified traffic is not just any traffic. It is made up of people who are genuinely inter-
ested in your offering, who are ready to buy it, and who have the means to buy it. This
implies that to successfully create an SEO campaign, you need to plan. You need to
understand your ideal prospect and know her habits, and create a step-by-step scheme
to lure her to your site, where she can be converted to a customer. It should be natural
and easy to perform this kind of planning if you’ve first followed the marketing plan
suggestions in Chapter 2.
SEO’s Evolution | 83

SEO cannot spin gold from straw or make a purse out of a sow’s ear. Garbage sites—
those that have come to be known as spam websites—will not draw huge amounts of
traffic. Or if they do, these sites won’t draw traffic for long. Google and other search
engines will pull the plug as soon as they detect what is going on.
There’s a web content arms race going on, with spammers and malware
creators on one side and Google and other content indexers and eval-
uators on the other. For Google and other search engines to stay in
business, the results they deliver have to be meaningful to users. This
means that there’s only so much content garbage that Google will put
up with.
Just as email spammers keep trying to outwit email filters, and filters
keep getting better in response, content spammers and Google are in-
volved in an arms race.
Your goal with SEO should not involve content spam, sometimes re-
ferred to as black hat SEO. Instead, be one of the good guys, a white
hat SEO practitioner. SEO skills are SEO skills whether the hat is black
or white. But use your white hat SEO skills to draw even more traffic to
sites that are already good and useful. In other words, SEO should be
used in an ethical and legitimate fashion to add genuinely interesting
and valuable content—and not as part of a scam to rip people off!
SEO needs to be regarded as an adjunct to the first law of the web: good content draws
traffic. There is no substitute for content that people really want to find.
While SEO best practices should always be observed, there needs to be a sense of
proportion in how SEO is used. It may not make sense to create a “Potemkin village”
using SEO to draw traffic to a site if the site itself doesn’t yield high returns. In other
words, SEO that is costly to implement is becoming regarded as one more aspect of
advertising campaign management—and subject to the same discipline of cost-
benefit analysis applied to all other well-managed advertising campaigns.
You’ll find a wide range of SEO analysis tools available to help you optimize your web
pages and sites:
Free tools
Free tools generally tackle a single piece of the SEO puzzle, such as generating good
keywords, understanding how Google operates on specific sites and keywords,
checking who links to your sites, and displaying rankings in multiple search engines
at once.
Google Webmaster Tools
The Google Webmaster Tools, which are free and were partially explained in
Chapter 3, provide many of the analysis features of third-party, one-off free tools.
84 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Commercial SEO analysis software
Commercial software costs money to license (obviously!) and is mainly intended
for administration of multiple SEO-improved sites.
Free Tools
There are a myriad of free SEO tools available, and there are many sites that list these
free tools. (The compendium sites are generally supported by advertising, and must
therefore practice good SEO themselves to be successful!)
Some good sites that list (and provide links) to free SEO analysis tools are http://www
.trugroovez.com/free-seo-tools.htm, http://www.webuildpages.com/tools/, and http://
www.seocompany.ca/tool/11-link-popularity-tools.html.
Some of the most useful (and free!) single-purpose SEO tools are:
NicheBot
A keyword discovery tool that helps pinpoint the right keywords for optimization
As I mentioned in Chapter 2, keyword lists such as those generated
by NicheBot are useful for marketing purposes.
The SERPS Tool
The SERPS (or search engine positioning) tool helps you discover your ranking
across Google and other major search engines in one fell swoop
Meta Tag Analyzer
Checks meta information for errors and relevance to page content
These tools can definitely be time-savers, particularly if you have a large amount of
content you need to optimize. The price is certainly right!
Individual tools also can serve as a reality check—by running your pages through one
of these tools, you can get a pretty good feeling for how well you have optimized a page.
However, you should bear in mind that there is nothing that one of these tools can do
for you that also cannot be done by hand given the knowledge you learn from this
chapter.
Individually, SEO analysis tools available on the web can help you with your SEO tasks.
However, to get the most from these tools, you need to understand underlying SEO
concepts as explained in this chapter before you use these tools.
Over time, as you progress with SEO, you will probably accumulate your own favorite
SEO analysis toolkit.
SEO’s Evolution | 85

Google Webmaster Tools
The Google Webmaster Tools provide several features that help with your inspection
and analysis of your websites and pages. For information about starting the tools and
launching them in reference to a specific site, see Chapter 3.
Formerly, many of the tools needed for effective SEO work had to be found piecemeal.
While some SEO practitioners still prefer their own toolkits assembled from the web
resources mentioned in “Free Tools” on page 85, the truth is that most essential tasks
can be performed using the Google Webmaster Tools.
The most important analysis tools are “Crawl errors” and “HTML suggestions” (both
in the Diagnostics tab) and “Your site on the web.”
Crawl errors
As shown in Figure 4-1, the crawl errors page shows you errors in your URLs as listed
in your site map (see “Taking Advantage of Site Mapping” on page 54). In addition,
the report will show you various other kinds of problems with the links (URLs) in your
site—and most important, links that lead to HTTP 404 errors because the file can’t be
found.
Figure 4-1. The crawl errors tool tells you about problems with the URLs on your site
The errors listed in the crawl errors report should be used as the basis
for further inquiry, but not necessarily considered definitive. URLs that
are listed as errors may simply be links that the Googlebot cannot follow
for a variety of reasons.
HTML suggestions
The HTML suggestions page shows you potential problems with meta descriptions,
title tags, and whether there is any content that is not indexable. As with the crawl
86 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

errors page, any reported errors should be taken as the starting place for investigation
rather than gospel.
Figure 4-2 shows an HTML suggestions report listing some meta description and title
tag problems.
Figure 4-2. The HTML suggestions tool helps you pinpoint problems you can fix with meta
descriptions, title tags, and content that cannot be indexed
Your site on the web
The “Your site on the web” page (Figure 4-3) helps give webmasters a window into
how their sites appear to the Googlebot. This page shows top search queries, inbound
links to your site, the anchor text of those links (i.e., the text that is visible in the
hyperlink as opposed to the destination URL), and the most common words found on
your site.
It’s important to be clear that the link text appears on the sites that link to you. Inbound
linking plays a very important role in Google’s evaluation of your site, and the anchor
text that accompanies links is what the bot uses to understand other sites’ ideas about
your site. Anchor text that is not descriptive, for example, “Click here,” doesn’t help
the bot. If you find sites that are linking to you with undescriptive anchor text, it’s good
SEO practice to work with these sites to improve the quality of these links.
“Your site on the web” also provides information about important keywords found on
your pages, as well as keywords used in external links to your site. This is a great place
to see how well the content is optimized for your target keywords. If they’re not on the
list, or not high on the list, it’s really easy to see where more work is needed.
SEO’s Evolution | 87

Figure 4-3. “Your site on the web” gives you the chance to view your site as Google sees it
Even if you’re not interested in SEO (but who isn’t?!), it’s worth running
“Your site on the web” from time to time and glancing at the Keywords
tab. If strange terms like hydrocodone and prescription have crept into
the keyword table, it is likely that you’ve been hacked (assuming you
don’t sell drugs on your site). Spam text of this sort may not be visible
to human viewers of your site, so it is good to have a mechanism for
making sure you haven’t been hacked.
Commercial SEO Analysis Software
Commercially licensed SEO analysis software is unlikely to prove worth its cost unless
you are in the business of performing SEO for numerous websites and a great deal of
content, or for a major enterprise.
If the advertising for this kind of software claims too much, beware!
If you do want to look into licensed SEO software, some of the better-known com-
mercial SEO analysis products are:
Keyword Elite
Keyword analysis
SEO Elite
Automated SEO analysis
Lyris HQ
Provides a hosted suite of integrated web tools that includes marketing services,
email, search marketing, web analytics, and web content management (CMS)
88 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

SEO Administrator
A suite of SEO analysis tools
Analysis tools are extremely important, not so much for the numbers they provide as
for the insights that webmasters can get into improving the usability of their sites. You’ll
find material in Chapter 13 about Google Analytics.
If your need for analysis can be categorized as “heavy-duty enterprise,”
you should look at software such as Omniture or WebTrends to see if
your needs can be better served than by Google Analytics.
More About How Your Site Appears to a Bot
The Google Webmaster Tools, explained in the previous section, help give you some
notion of Google’s evaluation of your website. But let’s step back for a second and look
at some general issues:
• Why this evaluation is very important
• How you can get a better intuitive feeling for bot evaluation
To state the obvious, before your site can be indexed by a search engine, it has to be
found by the search engine. Search engines find websites and web pages using software
that follows links to crawl the Web. This kind of software is variously called a crawler, a
spider, a search bot, or simply a bot (bot is a diminutive for “robot”).
You may be able to short circuit the process of waiting to be found by
the search engine’s bot by submitting your URL or site map directly to
search engines, as explained in Chapter 3.
To be found quickly by a search engine bot, it helps to have inbound links to your site.
More important, the links within your site should work properly. If a bot encounters a
broken link, it cannot reach, or index, the page pointed to by the broken link.
Images
Pictures don’t mean anything to a search bot. The only information a bot can gather
about pictures comes from the file name, from the alt attribute used within a picture’s
<img> tag, from text surrounding the picture, and in some cases from the image meta
data. Therefore, always take care to provide description information via alt along with
your images and at least one link (outside of an image map) to all pages on your site.
More About How Your Site Appears to a Bot | 89

While effective automated image analysis is still largely in the lab, or in
use by the military, its day is coming to the Internet. It’s likely that by
the time this book goes into its next edition, Google and others will have
added at least rudimentary image recognition features to their bots and
crawlers.
Links
Some kinds of links to pages (and sites) simply cannot be traversed by a search engine
bot. The most significant issue is that a bot cannot log in to your site. If a site or page
requires a username and a password for access, then it probably will not be included
in a search index.
Don’t be fooled by seamless page navigation using such techniques as
cookies or session identifiers. If an initial login is required, these pages
probably cannot be accessed by a bot.
When I was writing the previous edition of this book, there were some issues with
search engine navigation of dynamic URLs. Dynamic URLs are generated on the server
side from a database, and can often be recognized by characters in the URL such as ?,
&, and =. The current word from Google is that there are no problems with dynamic
URLs, and it may not be worth creating server-side rules to rewrite dynamic URLs to
make them look more like static URLs.
Navigation accomplished using JavaScript code can also be a problem,
and the best bet for implementing complex navigations is to use CSS
menus.
File Formats
Most search engines and search engine bots are capable of parsing and indexing many
different kinds of file formats. For example, Google states: “We are able to index most
types of pages and files with very few exceptions. File types we are able to index include:
pdf, asp, jsp, html, shtml, xml, cfm, doc, xls, ppt, rtf, wks, lwp, wri, swf.”
However, simple is often better. To get the best search engine placement, you are well
advised to keep your web pages, as they are actually opened in a browser, to straight
HTML. Note a couple of related issues:
• A file with a suffix other than .htm or .html can contain straight HTML. For ex-
ample, when they are opened in the browser, .asp, .aspx, .cfm, php, and .shtml files
often consist of straight HTML (it has, of course, been generated by server-side
software).
90 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

• Scripts (such as a PHP program) or include files (such as an .shtml page) running
on your web server usually generate HTML pages that are returned to the browser.
This architecture is shown in Figure 4-4. An important implication: check the
source file as shown in a browser rather than the script file used to generate a
dynamic page to see what the search engine will index.
Figure 4-4. Server-side programs usually return “straight” HTML to the browser
Google puts the “simple is best” precept this way: “If fancy features such as JavaScript,
cookies, session IDs, frames, DHTML, or Flash keep you from seeing all of your site
in a text browser, then search engine spiders may have trouble crawling your site.” The
only way to know for sure whether a bot will be unable to crawl your site is to check
your site using an all-text browser.
So go ahead, find out for sure. View your site in an all-text browser. It’s easy. And fun.
Viewing Your Site with an All-Text Browser
Improvement implies a feedback loop: you can’t know how well you are doing without
a mechanism for examining your current status. The feedback mechanism that helps
you improve your site from an SEO perspective is to view it as the bot sees it. While
information shown by the Google Webmaster Tools and other helpers is useful, nothing
beats a text-only view of your site.
This means viewing the site using a text-only browser. A text-only browser, just like
the search engine bot, will ignore images and graphics and only process the text on a
page.
More About How Your Site Appears to a Bot | 91

The best-known text-only web browser is Lynx. You can find more information about
Lynx at http://lynx.isc.org/. Generally, the process of installing Lynx involves down-
loading source code and compiling it.
The Lynx site also provides links to a variety of precompiled Lynx builds
you can download.
Don’t want to get into compiled source code or figuring out which idiosyncratic Lynx
build to download? There is a simple Lynx Viewer available on the Web at http://www
.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html.
All you have to do is navigate to this page in your browser and submit the URL for your
site. The text view of the page you’ll see (Figure 4-5) is starkly simpler than the com-
parable fully rendered view with images and graphics (Figure 4-6). The contrast may
be a real eye opener. You should take the time to “crawl” the text link in your site to
understand site navigation as well as page appearance from the bot’s viewpoint.
Excluding the Bot
There are a number of reasons you might want to block bots from all, or part, of your
site. For example, if your site is not complete, if you have broken links, or if you haven’t
prepared your site for a search engine visit, you probably don’t want to be indexed yet.
You may also want to protect parts of your site from being indexed if those parts contain
sensitive information or pages that you know cannot be accurately traversed or parsed.
Google requests that you block URLs that will give the bot hiccups—
for example, dynamic URLs that include calendar information that have
the potential for infinite expansion. You can block individual URLs us-
ing a nofollow attribute value in the anchor tag of the URL itself. For
example:
<a rel="nofollow" href="botcantgohere" />No follow me</a>
92 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Figure 4-5. Lynx Viewer makes it easy to focus on text and links without the distraction of the image-
rich version
If you need to, you can make sure that part of your site does not get indexed by any
search engine.
Following the no-robots protocol is voluntary and based on the honor
system. So all you can really be sure of is that a legitimate search engine
that follows the protocol will not index the prohibited parts of your site
from the root of your site (if there are external links to excluded pages,
these may still be traversed regardless of your policy file). Don’t rely on
search engine exclusion for security. Information that needs to be pro-
tected should be in password-protected locations, and protected by
software hardened for security purposes.
Excluding the Bot | 93

Figure 4-6. Compared with the identical page in a text-only view (Figure 4-5), it’s hard to focus on
just the text and links
The robots.txt File
To block bots from traversing your site, place a text file named robots.txt in your site’s
web root directory (where the HTML files for your site are placed). The following syntax
in the robots.txt file blocks all compliant bots from traversing your entire site:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
You can exercise more granular control over which bots you ban and which parts of
your site are off-limits as follows:
94 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

• The User-agent line specifies the bot that is to be banished.
• The Disallow line specifies a path relative to your root directory that is banned
territory.
A single robots.txt file can include multiple User-agent bot bannings,
each disallowing different paths.
For example, you would tell the Google search bot not to look in your cgi-bin directory
(assuming the cgi-bin directory is right beneath your web root directory) by placing the
following two lines in your robots.txt file:
User-agent: googlebot
Disallow: /images
As I’ve mentioned, the robots.txt mechanism relies on the honor system.
By definition, it is a text file that can be read by anyone with a browser.
Don’t rely on every bot honoring the request within a robots.txt file, and
don’t use robots.txt in an attempt to protect sensitive information from
being uncovered on your site by humans (this is a different issue from
using it to avoid publishing sensitive information in honest search en-
gine indexes like Google). In fact, someone trying to hack your site might
specifically read your robots.txt file in an attempt to uncover site areas
that you deem sensitive.
For more information about working with the robots.txt file, see the Web Robots
FAQ. You can also find tools for managing and generating custom robots.txt files and
robot meta tags (explained later) at http://www.rietta.com/robogen/ (an evaluation ver-
sion is available for free download).
Meta Robot Tags
The Googlebot and many other web robots can be instructed not to index specific pages
(rather than entire directories), not to follow links on a specific page, and to index but
not cache a specific page, all via the HTML meta tag placed inside of the head tag.
Google maintains a cache of documents it has indexed. The Google
search results provide a link to the cached version in addition to the
version on the Web. The cached version can be useful when the Web
version has changed and also because the cached version highlights the
search terms (so you can easily find them).
Excluding the Bot | 95

The meta tag used to block a robot has two attributes: name and content. The name
attribute is the name of the bot you are excluding. To exclude all robots, you’d include
the attribute name="robots" in the meta tag.
To exclude a specific robot, the robot’s identifier is used. The Googlebot’s identifier is
googlebot, and it is excluded by using the attribute name="googlebot". You can find the
entire database of registered and excludable robots and their identifiers (currently about
300) at http://www.robotstxt.org/db.html.
The more than 300 robots in the official database are the tip of the ice-
berg. There are at least 200,000 robots and crawlers “in the wild.” Some
of these software programs have malicious intent; all of them eat up
valuable web bandwidth. For more information about wild (and rogue)
robots, visit Bots vs. Browsers.
The possible values of the content attribute are shown in Table 4-1. You can use
multiple attribute values, separated by commas, but you should not use contradictory
attribute values together (such as content="follow, nofollow").
Table 4-1. Content attribute values and their meanings
Attribute value
Meaning
follow
Bot can follow links on the page
index
Bot can index the page
noarchive
Only works with the Googlebot; tells the Googlebot not to cache the page
nofollow
Bot should not follow links on the page
noindex
Bot should not index the page
For example, you can block Google from indexing a page, following links on a page,
and caching the page using this meta tag:
<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex, nofollow, noarchive">
More generally, the following tag tells legitimate bots (including the Googlebot) not to
index a page or follow any of the links on the page:
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
For more information about Google’s page-specific tags that exclude bots, and about
the Googlebot in general, see http://www.google.com/bot.html.
Meta Information
Meta information, sometimes called meta tags for short, is a mechanism you can use
to provide information about a web page.
96 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

The term derives from the Greek word meta, which means “behind” or
“hidden.” Meta refers to the aspect of something that is not immediately
visible, perhaps because it is in the background, but that is there none-
theless and has an impact.
The most common meta tags provide a description and keywords for telling a search
engine what your website and pages are all about. Each meta tag begins with a name
attribute that says what the meta tag represents. The meta tag:
<meta name="description" ...></meta>
means that this tag will provide descriptive information. The meta tag:
<meta name="keywords" ...></meta>
means that the tag will provide keywords.
The description and keywords go within a content attribute in the meta tag. For exam-
ple, here’s a meta description tag (often simply called the meta description):
<meta name="description" content="Quality information, articles about
a variety of topics ranging from Photoshop,
programming to business, and investing."></meta>
Keywords are provided in a comma-delimited list. For example:
<meta name="keywords" content="Photoshop, Wi-Fi,
wireless networking, programming, C#, business, investing, writing,
digital photography, eBay, pregnancy, information"></meta>
More About Meta Tags
Meta tags can contain a lot more than just descriptions and keywords, including (but
not limited to) a technical description of the kind of content on a page and even the
character encoding used:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;
charset=iso-8859-1" />
And you’ve already seen how meta tags can instruct search engine bots on what to index
in “Meta Robot Tags” on page 95.
It’s easy for anyone to put any meta tag keywords and description they’d like in a page’s
HTML code. This has lead to abuse when the meta tag information does not really
reflect page content. Therefore, meta tag keyword and description information is dep-
recated by search engine indexing software and not as heavily relied on by search en-
gines as it used to be. But it is still worth getting your meta tag keywords and
descriptions right, as there is little or no cost to it.
In Chapter 2, I explained how to create a short (one- or two-sentence) elevator pitch
for your website. The meta description is a perfect use for this elevator pitch. Be aware
Meta Information | 97

that your meta description may be what searchers see displayed for your site, particu-
larly if your site doesn’t have much text on the page.
Google will try to pick up page descriptions from text toward the be-
ginning of a page, but if this is not available—for example, because the
page consists of graphics only—it will look at the information in the
content attribute of a meta description. Providing a good meta descrip-
tion from the viewpoint of human browsers is therefore important.
For example, the home page of Digital Photography: Digital Field Guide (shown in
Figure 4-7) doesn’t have much text, but it does have a lot of images.
Figure 4-7. Meta description information is particularly important when your website or page doesn’t
have much text (like this home page)
Meta keywords should be limited to a dozen or so terms. Don’t load up the proverbial
kitchen sink. Think hard about the keywords that you’d like to lead to your site when
visitors search (see “Words and Keyword Density” on page 100).
98 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

For the keywords that are really significant to your site, you should include both single
and plural forms, as well as any variants. A site about photography might want to
include both “photograph” and “photography” as meta tags.
Here’s the meta tag information included in the HTML source code for the home page
of the Digital Photography: Digital Field Guide site:
<meta name="description" content="Showcasing digital photographs by Harold Davis:
photomacrography, flowers, landscapes and relevant Photoshop techniques"/>
<meta name="keywords" content="Digital, photography, photographs, photograms,
scans, night, field, guide, camera, tripod, filter, photo, processing, Harold
Davis, photomacrography, macro, landscapes, roadtrip, adventure, San Francisco,
Bayscapes, flowers, Yosemite, Wave, Photoshop"/>
Since Google’s software can’t find what this page is about except by reading the meta
description, because the page is almost all images with no text, the meta description is
what shows up when the site is part of Google’s search results (see Figure 4-8). The
moral: if there aren’t very many words on your page, pick your meta description and
keywords with special care.
Figure 4-8. In this example, Google simply took the meta description verbatim since it couldn’t find
a description on the page itself
Design for SEO
Designing a site to be SEO-friendly encompasses a wide range of topics that include
the general structure of the site and its hierarchy, principles and content ratio of indi-
vidual pages, and specifics of using HTML tags.
Keyword density means the ratio of keywords that you are trying to target for SEO
purposes to the other text on your pages. Getting keyword density right—enough so
that your SEO goals are achieved, not so much that the search engines are “offended”—
is an important goal of core SEO practice. Search engines do look for keywords, but
they take away points for excessive and inappropriate keyword “stuffing.”
Design for SEO | 99

Even from the point of view of your site visitors, you want a nice density of keywords
in your pages—but you don’t want so many keywords that the content of your pages
is diminished from the viewpoint of visitors.
It is certainly true that which keywords you use is more important than how many of
them there are. Your main focus should be on finding the right keywords, not counting
them.
Site Design Principles
The following are some design and information architecture guidelines you should
apply to your site to optimize it for search engines.
Text is best
For most sites, the fancy graphics do not matter. If you are looking for search engine
placement, it is the words that count. Always use text instead of—or in addition to—
images to display important names, content, and links. Where it’s reasonable, add a
title attribute to anchor tags to provide the bot with more information about the
destination and purpose of hyperlinks.
Make sure you provide accurate alt attribute text for any content-
related images that are on your pages (such as logo and photos, but not
purely formatting graphics such as stripes, etc.).
Navigability
Pages within your site should be structured with a clear hierarchy. Several alternative
site navigation mechanisms should be supplied, including at least one that is text-only.
The major parts of your site should be easy to access using a site map. If your site map
has more than 100 links, you should divide the site map into separate pages (as a matter
of usability, not in relation to Google’s analysis).
Words and Keyword Density
By now, you probably understand that the most important thing you can do on the
SEO front involves the words on your pages.
There are three issues you need to consider when placing keywords on a page:
• How many words should be on a page?
• Which words belong on what page?
• Where should these be placed on the page?
100 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Page size
Ideally, pages should be between 100 and 250 words. Shorter than 100 words, and
Google and other search engines may tend to discount the page as unsubstantial.
Personally, as a photographer I tend to resent this anti-image bias. But from an SEO
standpoint, you should know the facts of life as they are. The Web started as a primarily
text-based medium, and the underlying technology still tends to prefer words.
You do want to include as many keywords as you can without destroying the value and
integrity of the site. Besides decreasing the value to humans, you don’t want the bot to
think you have created a spam site. There’s a balance here. With fewer than 100 words,
any significant inclusion of keywords is going to look like keyword stuffing—and get
“points” taken off your pages.
Pages that are longer than 250 words are not terrible, but do tend to diminish traffic—
both actual and measured as a per page statistic. From the viewpoint of advertising,
lengthy pages waste content; 250 words is about as many as will fit on a single monitor
screen, so your visitors will have to scroll down to finish reading the rest of the page if
you publish longer pages. You might as well provide navigation to additional pages for
the content beyond the 250 words—and gain the benefit of having extra pages to host
advertising.
Some sites prefer to run longer pages and rotate ads with the page still
loaded. This should be considered a good option for any page with an
average page view of a minute or longer.
The bottom line is that it’s best to create pages that have between 100 and 250 words.
These words should include some keywords that are desirable, but don’t overdo it. If
the sentences on the page appear unnatural because they are full of keywords, they have
probably been “keyword stuffed”—which is counterproductive.
Choosing keywords
Beyond the mechanics of crafting sites and pages that are search-engine friendly lies
another issue: what search queries does your site answer? You need to understand this
to find the keywords to emphasize in your site construction—a very important part of
Search Engine Optimization.
Keywords used in the body of a page can duplicate the keywords used in meta tags.
However, it’s important to understand that the keywords within a page are far more
important than the meta tag information.
Design for SEO | 101

Keywords are emphasized by their placement within a page. For exam-
ple, important keywords should go in a page’s HTML <title> and in
<h1> headers. It’s best to craft titles and tags that reasonable and logically
use the target keywords, but this can’t always be done, and you can
always add a few keywords to the phrase used for the title attribute
within tags such as the <h1> tag.
There’s no magic bullet for coming up with the right keywords to place in a page. A
good starting place is the elevator pitch and related keywords, as explained in Chap-
ter 2. You can also take a look at your competition to see if their optimization makes
sense in terms of titles, keywords, and so on.
It’s fundamental to your success to vary keywords used in a page depending on the
page content, rather than trying to stuff a one-size-fits-all approach across all the pages
on your site. In fact, Google will definitely take points off if it finds that all the pages
on your site emphasize the same keywords.
If the answer is X, for example, what is the question? This is the right way to consider
keyword choice. X is your website or web page. What did someone type into Google
to get there?
The Top Search Queries page on the Statistics tab of Google Webmaster Tools will, to
some extent, answer this question for you. This page will tell you the top 20 search
queries that returned your site. Bear in mind that you may need to know about more
than the top 20 searches (this is the province of web logs and web analytics programs,
as explained in Chapter 13). In addition, the Google Webmasters information is at least
a week old, which may not be fresh enough for quickly moving sites.
As you come up with keywords and phrases, try them out. Search Google based on the
keywords and phrases. Ask yourself if the results returned by Google are where you
would like to see your site. If not, tweak, modify, wait for Google to re-index your site
(this won’t take too long once you’ve been initially indexed), and try your search again.
Ultimately, the best way to measure success is relative. It’s easy to see how changes
impact your search results ranking—just keep searching (as often as once a day) for a
standard set of half a dozen keywords or phrases that you’ve decided to target. If you
are moving up in the search rankings, then you are doing the right thing. If your ranking
doesn’t improve, then reverse the changes. If you get search results to where you want
them (usually within the top 30 or even top 10 results returned), then start using these
results to optimize additional pages.
102 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

You should also realize that the success that is possible for a given keyword search
depends upon the keyword. It’s highly unlikely that you will be able to position a site
into the top results for, say, “Google” or “Microsoft”—but trivial to get to the top for
keywords phrases with no natural search results (such as “nigritude ultramarine” or
“loquine glupe,” two nonsense phrases that became the fodder for SEO contests).
The trade-off here is that it is a great deal harder to place at the top of natural search
listings with keywords that are valuable—so you need to find a sweet spot: keywords
where you stand a chance, but that also will drive significant site-related traffic.
Since feedback is ultimately determined by financial incentive, an in-
teresting approach to keyword selection is to see what words cost the
most to advertisers. If you are registered with Google AdWords, you
can use the AdWords tools as explained in Part III to do just that—and
get valid cost estimates for keywords and phrases.
Keyword placement
The text on your web page should include the most important keywords you have
developed in as unforced a way as possible. Try to string keywords together to make
coherent sentences.
Not all text on a page is equal in importance. First of all, order does count: keywords
higher up in a given page get more recognition from search engines than the same
keywords further down on a page.
Roughly speaking, besides the body of the page itself and in meta information, you
should try to place your keywords in the following elements—presented roughly in
order of descending importance:
Title
Putting relevant keywords in the HTML <title> tag for your page is probably the
single most important thing you can do in terms of SEO.
Headers
Keyword placement within HTML header styles, particularly <h1> headers toward
the top of a page, is extremely important.
Links
Use your keywords as much as possible in the text that is enclosed by
<a href="">...</a> hyperlink tags on your site in outbound and cross-bound links.
Ask webmasters who provide inbound linking to your site to use your keywords
whenever possible.
Images
Include your keywords in the alt attribute of your HTML <img> tags.
Design for SEO | 103

Text in bold
If there is any reasonable excuse for doing so, include your keywords within HTML
bold (<b>...</b>) tags.
The saying, “Everything in moderation, even moderation” is a good principle to keep
in mind when you tweak your website to achieve SEO. The moderation slogan has been
aptly applied to many human activities, from the sexual to the gustatory and beyond.
It fits very well with SEO.
For example, you want a nice density of keywords in your pages, but you don’t want
so many keywords that the content of your pages is diminished from the viewpoint of
visitors. Search engines look for keywords, but they take away points for excessive and
inappropriate keyword “stuffing.”
Put Meta Tags in an Include
In Chapter 1, I explained the importance of using includes to manage site content. In
that same vein, the HTML used for meta tags and description information should be
placed in a single include file, making it easy to change your meta information across
an entire site or a series of related pages.
You do want to be careful to provide relevant meta information for different pages. If
your site is large, with many pages, and has several distinct areas of content, you can
create a separate file, each consisting only of meta description and tags, for each content
area.
You can always customize the meta information for a specific page by discarding the
reference to the meta include file and adding page-specific meta information. Alterna-
tively, you can create a page-specific meta include, keeping track of your meta includes
by placing them all in one directory and devising a sensible naming convention.
It’s a really good idea to have default meta information for a site that can easily be
tweaked. However, default descriptions may not be competitive with individual hand-
created descriptions. There have been a variety of creative approaches to deal with this
conundrum; one that seems to work fairly well is to write good page content and then
dynamically copy the first 150 characters as the meta description.
Try to see the world from a search engine bot’s viewpoint (that’s the point of using a
text-only browser as I explained in “More About How Your Site Appears to a
Bot” on page 89). Create sites that appeal when looked at this way, but go easy. Don’t
overdo it!
104 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Site Design Principles
The following are some design and information architecture guidelines you should
apply to your site to optimize it for search engines.
Eschew fancy graphics
Fancy graphics do not matter for most sites. When it comes to search engine place-
ment, it is the words that count.
Use text wherever possible
Use text rather than images to display important names, content, and links.
Always provide alt attributes for images
Make sure you provide accurate alt attribute text for any images that are on your
pages.
Navigability
Pages within your site should be structured with a clear hierarchy. Several alter-
native site-navigation mechanisms should be supplied, including at least one that
is text-only.
Provide text links
Every page in your site should be accessible using a static text link.
Make a site map available to your users
The major parts of your site should be easy to access using a site map (Figure 4-9
shows an example of a useful site map). If your site map has more than 100 links,
you should divide the site map into separate pages.
Your human site map should not be confused with a site map prepared
for search engines, as explained in Chapter 3.
Using PageRank
The PageRank algorithm is used in part by Google to order the results returned by
specific search queries. As such, understanding PageRank is crucial to core SEO efforts
to improve natural search results.
Depending on who you ask, PageRank is named after its inventor, Lawrence Page,
Google’s cofounder—or because it is a mechanism for ranking pages.
When a user enters a query, also called a search, into Google, the result order of the
returns is partially determined by the relative PageRank of the results.
Using PageRank | 105

Figure 4-9. A site map makes it easy for visitors to find what they need on your site and also helps
optimize your site for search engines
Originally fairly simple in concept, PageRank now reportedly processes more than 100
variables. Since the exact nature of this “secret sauce” is, well, secret, the best thing you
can do from an SEO perspective is more or less stick to the original concept.
The underlying idea behind PageRank is an old one that has been used by librarians in
the pre-Web past to provide an objective method of scoring the relative importance of
scholarly documents. The more citations other documents make to a particular docu-
ment, the more “important” the document is, the higher its rank in the system, and the
more likely it is to be retrieved first.
Let me break it down for you.
106 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Each web page is assigned a number depending upon the number of other pages that
link to the page.
The crucial element that makes PageRank work is the nature of the Web itself, which
depends almost solely on the use of hyperlinking between pages and sites. In the system
that makes Google’s PageRank algorithm work, links are a Web popularity contest:
Webmaster A thinks Webmaster B’s site has good information (or is cool, or looks
good, or is funny), so Webmaster A may decide to add a link to Webmaster B’s site. In
turn, Webmaster B might return the favor.
Links from Website A to Website B are called outbound (from A) and inbound links
(to B).
The more inbound links a page has (references from other sites), the more likely it is
to have a higher PageRank. However, not all inbound links are of equal weight when
it comes to how they contribute to PageRank—nor should they be. A web page gets a
higher PageRank if another significant source (by “significant” I mean a source that
also receives a lot of inbound links, and thus has a higher PageRank) links to it than if
a trivial site without traffic provides the inbound link.
PageRank is essentially a recursive algorithm, meaning a process that
invokes itself. A given page’s PageRank is the sum of the PageRanks of
the pages that link to it (weighted by the total number of links, of
course). In this scheme, a link from a high PageRank page clearly counts
for more than a link from a low-ranking page. See the sidebar “Under-
standing PageRank” on page 108.
The more sophisticated version of the PageRank algorithm currently used by Google
involves more than simply crunching the number of links to a page and the PageRank
of each page that provides an inbound link. While Google’s exact method of calculating
PageRank is shrouded in proprietary mystery, PageRank does try to exclude links from
so-called link farms, pages that contain only links, and mutual linking (which are in-
dividual two-way links put up for the sole purpose of boosting PageRanks).
The easiest way to see the comparative PageRank for your web pages is
to install the Google Toolbar. With a web page open, the PageRank is
shown in the Toolbar on a scale of 0 to 10. These PageRanks are really
between 0 and 1, so although the 0 to 10 scale is useful for comparison
purposes, it does not represent an actual PageRank number.
Note that you may have to specifically turn on the feature that displays
PageRank in the Google Toolbar; in some installations this feature is
not enabled by default.
Using PageRank | 107

From the viewpoint of SEO, it’s easy to understand some of the implications of
PageRank. If you want your site to have a high PageRank, then you need to get as many
high-ranked sites as possible to link to you.
However, useful outbound links draw traffic to the linking site and encourage other
sites to return the favor because they respect the quality of the links the original site
provides. So for SEO, there’s a delicate balancing act with outbound linking—some
quality outbound links add merit to a site, but too many outbound links decrease
desirability. Trial and error is probably the only way to get this one right.
Understanding PageRank
The PageRank formula can be thought of as a model of user behavior of “random
surfers.” Such a random surfer visits a random web page, keeps clicking links randomly,
never clicking the back button, and eventually gets bored enough to visit a new random
page by typing the web address into the browser. The probability that the random surfer
visits a particular page is its PageRank. The probability at each page that the random
surfer will get bored and request a new random page is called the damping factor,
represented by “d” in the formula.
Put this way, the PageRank for a specific web page can clearly be calculated by going
through all the inbound links to a page, calculating the PageRanks of all these pages,
backing up to calculate the inbound links in turn to the new set of pages, and so on,
all the way back until there are no more inbound links. A little more technically, a web
page’s PageRank can be calculated by iterating recursively through all of its inbound
linked pages. This is the fundamental method behind Google’s search engine, although
in the real world (as you likely know if you’ve read this far in this sidebar) there are
usually nonrecursive techniques that calculate results more quickly than the corre-
sponding recursive algorithm.
The original formula for PageRank with further explanation is contained in the Brin
and Page page at Stanford University. Here it is—PR stands for PageRank; A stands for
a random page, identified as Page A; T1...Tn signifies all the pages that link to Page A;
and C(A) represents the number of Page A’s outbound links:
PR(A) = (1-d) + d(PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + d(PR(Tn)/C(Tn)
PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages’
PageRanks is 1.
The formula for PageRank has, of course, evolved since this formulation—as I’ve men-
tioned, it now involves more than 100 variables—and its exact nature is part of Google’s
proprietary technology. It’s still the case that some of the best insights into how Google
works for SEO purposes come from this early academic formulation.
108 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

Linking
The links on your site constitute a very important part of how Google and other search
engines will rank your pages.
Links can be categorized into inbound links, outbound links, and cross links (see
Figure 4-10):
Inbound links
These links point to a page on your website from an external site somewhere else
on the Web.
Outbound links
These links point from a page on your site to an external site somewhere else on
the Web.
Cross links
These links point between the pages on your site.
Figure 4-10. It’s important to understand the distinctions among the three categories of links
Broken Links
It’s important to search engines such as Google that the links on your site are not
broken. It shouldn’t be that big of a problem to go through your site and check to make
sure each link works manually. Doing this will also give you a chance to review your
site systematically and understand the navigation flow from the viewpoint of a bot.
Even though you’ve checked your links manually, you should also use an automated
link checking tool. Quite a few are available. A good choice is the simple (and free) link
checker provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at http://validator.w3
.org/checklink. As you can see in Figure 4-11, all you need to do is enter the domain
you want checked and watch the results as the links on your site are crawled.
Linking | 109

Figure 4-11. An automated link checker goes through the hyperlinks on a page (or site) one by one
Inbound links
You want as many inbound links as possible, provided these links are not from link
farms or link exchanges. With this caveat about inbound linking from “naughty neigh-
borhoods” understood, you cannot have too many inbound links. The more popular,
and the higher the ranking of, the sites providing the inbound links to your site, the
better.
PageRank and Inbound Links
Inbound links are considered a shorthand way of determining the value of your website,
because other sites have decided your site has content worth linking to. An inbound
link from a site that is itself highly valued is worth more than an inbound link from a
low-value site, for obvious reasons.
This concept is at the core of Google’s famous PageRank algorithm (see the earlier
section “Using PageRank” on page 105).
For information about the best approaches for generating inbound
links, see Chapter 3.
110 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

The best—meaning most likely to drive traffic—inbound links come from:
• Sites that publish content that is complementary and related to the content on your
site
• Hub sites that are a central repository, discussion area, or community site for a
particular interest group
Outbound Links
The “everything in moderation” slogan is really apt when it comes to outbound links.
You could also say that the “outbound link giveth and the outbound link taketh.”
Here’s why: you want some respectable outbound links to establish the credibility of
your site and pages and to provide a useful service for visitors. After all, part of the point
of the Web is that it is a mechanism for linking information, and it is truly useless to
pretend that all good information is on your site. So on-topic outbound links are them-
selves valuable content.
However, every time your site provides an outbound link, there is a probability that
visitors to your site will use it to surf off your site. As a matter of statistics, this proba-
bility diminishes the popularity of your site, and Google will subtract points from your
ranking if you have too many outbound links. In particular, pages that are essentially
lists of outbound links are penalized.
If you follow the words-per-page guideline I made in “Words and Keyword Den-
sity” on page 100—between 100 and 250 words per page—you’ll get the best results
if you try to provide at least 2 or 3 outbound links on every page and, in any case, no
more than 10 or 15 per page.
Cross Links
Cross links—links within your site—are important to visitors as a way to find useful,
related content. For example, if you have a page explaining the concept of class inher-
itance in an object-oriented programming language, a cross link to an explanation of
the related concept of the class interface might help some visitors. From a navigability
viewpoint, the idea is that it should be easy to move through all information that is
topically related.
From an SEO perspective, your site should provide as many cross links as possible
(without stretching the relevance of the links to the breaking point). There’s no down-
side to providing reasonable cross links, and several reasons for providing them. For
example, effective cross linking keeps visitors on your site longer (as opposed to heading
offsite because they can’t find what they need on your site).
Linking | 111

Avoiding Overly Aggressive SEO
Google, like other major search engines, urges you to avoid overly aggressive SEO
practices when you build your site.
Here’s why you should avoid being overly aggressive with SEO (besides wanting to
avoid Google’s disapproval): building sites that get highly ranked is simply a matter of
common sense; just build a site that will be useful or interesting to people, and it will
naturally get indexed correctly, although this may take some time.
With this viewpoint, you shouldn’t concern yourself with search order ranking or SEO
when you construct your site. Just create worthwhile content that is genuinely useful,
interesting, or entertaining. However, at the same time you needn’t be naïve. It makes
sense to deploy sites and pages in the most SEO-compliant way possible that doesn’t
cross the line into deceptive behavior—or one of the constructions frowned upon by
Google.
SEO experts tend to disagree with this “build it with quality and they
will come” theory of site creation. They point to the incredible compe-
tition for premium SEO results, and the money that is at stake, and
suggest planning in advance for effective SEO with a knowledgeable
expert.
Google’s Prohibitions
Following is a list of the techniques that Google considers bad behavior. Google pro-
hibits these things because it considers them overaggressive and deceptive, but note
that Google does not consider this list exhaustive and may penalize your site for any-
thing new that you come up with if it is considered deceptive to either humans or the
Googlebot, assuming it is discovered.
According to Google, good search engine citizen websites do not:
Employ hidden text or links
For example, users cannot read white text on a white background (and will never
even know it is there), but this text will be parsed by the search engine. This rule
comes down to making sure that the search engine sees the same thing that users
view.
Cloak pages
Also called stealth, this is a technique that involves serving different pages to the
search engine than to the user.
Use redirects in a deceptive way
It’s easy to redirect the user’s browser to another page. If this is done for deceptive
purposes—for example, to make users think they are on a page associated with a
112 | Chapter 4: Nuts and Bolts of SEO

well-known brand when in fact they are on a web spammer’s page—it’s frowned
upon.
Attempt to improve your PageRank with dubious schemes
Linking to web spammers or bad neighborhoods on the Web may actually hurt
your own PageRank (or search ranking), even if doing so provides inbound links
to your site. (For information about how to legitimately encourage inbound site
linking, and therefore improve your PageRank, see Chapter 3.)
Bad neighborhoods are primarily link farms or link exchanges—
sites that exist solely for the purpose of boosting a site’s inbound
links without other content. Web spammers are sites that disguise
themselves with pseudo-descriptions and fake keywords—the
descriptions and keywords do not truly represent what the site
contains.
Bombard Google with automated queries
This wastes Google’s bandwidth, so it doesn’t like it.
Practice keyword loading
This is the practice, beloved by some purported SEO “experts,” of adding irrelevant
words to pages. (The page can then be served as the search result based on a query
for the irrelevant words that actually don’t have anything to do with the page
content.)
Create multiple similar pages
Google frowns on the creation of pages, domains, and subdomains that duplicate
content.
Use cloaking or redirection
These techniques send a user to a page that has nothing to do with the one in the
search engine results. (A variety of techniques may be used to substitute one page
for another—either by redirection or actual substitution of pages on the web
server—when the first page is optimized for specific keyword searches and the page
to which the user is actually sent has little or nothing to do with that search.)
Create pages that lack content
Google frowns on pages that lack original content, such as a page that exists simply
to present affiliate links.
Create domains with the intention of confusing users
It’s likely you’ve landed on a site with a domain name that’s confusing because it
shares a name with a different domain suffix (for example, http://www.php.org,
which combines a redirection with the deception, rather than the legitimate PHP
language site, http://www.php.net) or because of a slight spelling variation (http://
www.yahho.com rather than http://www.yahoo.com).
Avoiding Overly Aggressive SEO | 113

Publish advertising that is not clearly denoted as such
Paid advertisements and links are not in and of themselves evil, but graphically it
should be clear to viewers what they are looking at. In addition, the Googlebot
should be warned that it is looking at paid advertising through the use of the
nofollow attribute in links within the ad.
Paid advertising links should be marked with the nofollow attrib-
ute, but not all links marked in this way are advertisements.
The following code snippet contains a way to make the ad distinctive for humans
(the adalt class formatting) and a nofollow attribute to make the paid nature of the
link clear to bots as well:
<p class="ad adalt"><small>Please buy widgets from <a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.advertiser.com/">this advertiser</a>. Thanks!</small></p>
A Nefarious Domain Spamming Example
A really egregious example of the nefarious practice of domain spamming is Org.com.
Org.com is a link farm that takes advantage of the fact that if you enter the body of an
address in the address bar of Internet Explorer and hit Ctrl + Enter, you are taken to
the .com domain related to what you entered. For example, if you enter “google” in the
IE address bar, and press Ctrl + Enter, http://www.google.com opens. So suppose, by
mistake, you enter anything followed by .org in the address bar—for example,
“www.w3.org”, expecting to open the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) site—
and press Ctrl + Enter. Instead of W3C, http://www.w3c.org.com—in other words,
Org.com (and its link menu)—will open.
Google frowns on deceptive domain naming if the domain name was selected for the
purpose of taking advantage of the confusion.
As Google puts it, spending your energy creating a good user experience will let you
“enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can
exploit.”
If you are a webmaster, you’ve likely been approached to pay for SEO
services. While there are many reputable and effective SEO consultants,
there are also a fair number of scam artists. Remember: if something
seems too good to be true, it likely is.

Why Not to Be Overly Aggressive
If you draw Google’s attention for practicing dirty tricks, you can get expelled from
Google’s index altogether. Worse, there’s effectively no way to appeal a Google decision
to expel a site from its index. Nor is there a set of procedural safeguards for webmasters
who feel they have been wrongfully accused of deceitful SEO practices. It’s therefore
safest to avoid the wrath of Google by avoiding anything that even smacks of deceit.
You can appeal for reconsideration from Google at the form found at
https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/reconsideration, but there’s
no guarantee that Google will respond to your request, or when it will
do so.
Most dirty SEO tricks are also simply bad web design. If you put sites together using
bad practices that are intended solely to optimize your sites, most often you’ll just
irritate visitors—and get less traffic.
Google and other major search engines urge you to avoid overly aggressive SEO prac-
tices when you build your site. Google has actually taken the trouble to spell out SEO
practices it regards as naughty (the list can be found at http://www.google.com/support/
webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769). You should pay attention to this list as if it
speaks the mind of every major search engine, not just Google. Google’s position that
building sites that get highly ranked is simply a matter of providing useful content isn’t
totally off-the-wall, although it assumes a world where everything always works.
Action Items
Here are some action items for you to optimize your website and pages for SEO:
• Understand what SEO can (and can’t) do
• Get to know the relevant Google Webmaster Tools
• Learn about available SEO tools
• View your site in text-only mode
• Determine if you need to exclude search engine bots from portions of your site (or,
if you already do exclude bots partially or completely, review the exclusion and
change it as needed so your site can be indexed)
• Tweak the meta information for the site’s major content areas or for individual
pages
• Create a text-heavy and easily navigable site
• Check for, and fix, any broken links
Action Items | 115

• Understand how PageRank works and the implications for your site
• Work to add appropriate inbound, outbound, and cross links
• Choose keywords that make sense for your content and the traffic you are seeking,
and add them to the important elements of your page content
• Endeavor to reach a keyword density balance
• Make sure your site avoids overly aggressive SEO practices

CHAPTER 5
Making Money with Affiliate Programs
You’ve got the content (Chapter 1). You’ve created a business plan for your site
(Chapter 2). You’ve learned how to drive traffic to your site (Chapter 3). You’ve opti-
mized your site for search engine placement (Chapter 4). Now, where’s the money?
This chapter explains how to make money from your website by having your site work
as a virtual “sales rep.” You become a sales rep for another site, often called a
merchant, by becoming an affiliate, sometimes called an associate, of the merchant.
With affiliate programs, your site provides links to a merchant’s site. You make money
if—and only if—visitors you send to the merchant’s site make purchases. If this sounds
easy, it can be. You don’t need to stock inventory or worry about fulfillment, shipping,
and returns. And you still make money—sometimes very good money—when the
product sells. Best of all, the visitor doesn’t necessarily need to make a purchase right
away.
However, selling on the Internet is very competitive; there are always multiple avenues
for a consumer to buy anything. Furthermore, there’s nothing to stop consumers from
bypassing your site completely and going directly to the merchant. You’ll only be suc-
cessful with your affiliate links if the goods provided by the merchants you are associ-
ated with are relevant to the content of your site. Specificity also helps. There must be
a good connection between your site content and specific offerings of the affiliated
merchant.
This chapter explains the different kinds of ad programs, how affiliate advertising
works, and how to work with affiliate aggregators—everything you need to know to
make money with affiliate programs, provided your sites draw traffic that will click on
links to your affiliated merchants and that this traffic converts into actual purchasers.
117

Kinds of Ad Programs
Affiliate programs differ from most other advertising approaches: to make money, your
traffic has to generate actual sales. This important distinction has implications for your
website content and design.
It’s worth going over the three primary approaches to making money via advertising
with your web content so that the underlying distinctiveness of the affiliate advertising
approach is clear.
The three most common ways to use advertising to make money with content on the
Web are:
Affiliate programs
Affiliate programs pay you a sales commission when someone who clicks through
a link on your site to an advertiser’s site actually buys something from that
advertiser.
Sponsored advertising
You are paid a fee when a sponsored ad (either banner or text) is displayed on your
site. Sponsored ads are often called CPM—short for cost per thousand page im-
pressions—ads because they are paid for on a CPM basis.
For more information on CPM ads, see Chapter 6.
Contextual advertising
Contextual advertising is primarily text-based advertising that appears on web
pages where there is a contextual relevance as determined by automated software.
Contextual ads are often called CPC—short for cost per click—ads, because that
is the basis on which they are paid.
For more general information about contextual advertising, see Chap-
ter 6. Google’s AdSense is the best-known CPC program. Working with
AdSense is explained in Part II.
From your viewpoint—that of the publisher of content on one or more websites—what
you probably really care about is how much money you can make from each kind of
approach to advertising. Of course, that depends on a great many variables, and there
are ways to maximize the yield from each kind of advertising program. It’s worth ex-
perimenting to find out which kind of advertising works best with the specific content
on your site (and the kind of traffic your site draws). It’s also the case that many content
sites carry all three kinds of advertising.
118 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

The key conceptual difference between the three kinds of advertising is what a visitor
to your site has to do to make you money. It’s a spectrum.
One way to look at this is by the amount of action required on the part of your site
visitor, from most to least:
Affiliate ad
The visitor has to actually get out a credit card and make an online purchase from
the advertiser’s site (if not right away, then within a designated amount of time).
Contextual ad
The visitor has to click the ad to surf to the advertiser’s page (but does not have to
actually buy anything).
Sponsored ad
All that has to happen is that the ad is displayed on your page.
Understanding Affiliate Programs
Affiliate programs go by many names, including affiliate marketing programs, virtual
marketing, revenue sharing, associate programs, Internet affiliate marketing, direct
marketing, performance marketing, partner marketing, pay-for-performance, and re-
ferral programs. The names themselves give you an idea of what is involved. But as
Shakespeare put it in Romeo and Juliet: What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.
By whatever name it’s called, an affiliate earns a commission from a merchant for gen-
erating a desired result. The specific result that must occur for the affiliate to earn a
commission is (or should be) spelled out, and specified contractually, when the affiliate
signs up for the program.
Read the fine print carefully when you sign up for an affiliate program.
These agreements can be complicated, and you should be completely
clear about exactly what commission you are supposed to get under all
the circumstances covered by the agreement.
Most often, the event that leads to a commission for the affiliate is (as I’ve already said)
a merchant sale resulting from the affiliate’s promotion. But this need not be the case.
In some (less common) circumstances, providing a merchant with a qualified sales lead
may be enough to generate a commission for the affiliate.
Joining an affiliate program is potentially lucrative, but requires real attention and care.
If not done right, you may not make any money from the affiliate programs you have
joined.
Unlike other forms of advertising on your site, you really should care about who your
affiliate partners are. This is because you do not get paid unless the affiliate links on
Understanding Affiliate Programs | 119

your site lead fairly directly to a sale. With contextual or sponsored ads, your content
is merely a host for advertising; with an affiliate ad, you are a kind of partner.
Understanding affiliate programs can be confusing—there’s not a great deal of objective
information available about this kind of advertising, affiliate aggregation sites are com-
plex, and affiliate agreements are often full of legalese and opaque. But fear not! After
reading this chapter, you’ll have a pretty good idea of what affiliate programs are, how
they work, and how you can craft an affiliate strategy that can help you make money
from your web content.
Mechanics of the Process
There are a number of steps involved in the affiliate marketing process. Here’s an
overview:
1. A publisher signs up for affiliation with a merchant.
2. The merchant approves the affiliation and welcomes the publisher into the
program.
3. The publisher is provided with a tracking number for the program.
4. The merchant makes available to the publisher a variety of graphics and links for
the program.
5. The publisher constructs links to the merchant that incorporate the tracking num-
ber and may use the other material supplied by the merchant.
6. Visitors to the publisher’s site click the links.
7. The merchant’s site tracks purchases made by visitors from the publisher.
8. The merchant puts a cookie on the visitor’s computer that tracks additional pur-
chases during a designated period.
9. The merchant makes periodic reports to the publisher and pays a sales commission
based on actual purchases.
These steps are shown in Figure 5-1.
Here are the steps in the process explained in a little more detail:
1. Publisher signup
A publisher (an owner of a content-based website or sites) signs up as a web affiliate
of a merchant, either using an affiliate aggregator—a company in the business of
servicing affiliates for multiple merchants (see “Benefits of Affiliate Aggrega-
tors” on page 130)—or directly with the merchant (for example, Amazon.com).
This signup is done using a web interface, although sometimes certain documents
(such as a W9 tax form) may need to be filed with the merchant or affiliate aggre-
gator by mail or fax.
You’ll need a Social Security number or an employee tax identification number
(EIN) to sign up with most affiliate programs based in the United States.
120 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

Note that some solo merchants use affiliate aggregation software to power their
programs. In this case, even though the merchant is using software supplied by an
aggregator, it is a one-off—you are signing up with one, and only one, merchant.
Figure 5-1. Visitors link through the publisher’s site to purchase from the merchant; a third-party
aggregator may track sales and commissions
2. Merchant approval
The merchant approves the publisher. Depending on the goals and methods of the
merchant, this step may happen automatically or semiautomatically, or it may
involve a manual determination of the suitability of the publisher by the merchant.
Marketing goals and guidelines vary; a premium-brand merchant may want to take
care that an affiliate is not perceived as déclassé and therefore manually approve
all affiliates.
In some cases, merchants have outreach programs that contact sites they may feel
are appropriate for affiliation. Other brands may feel that the more inbound links,
the better, and let anyone sign up as an affiliate who wants to.
3. Tracking ID
Once the publisher has been approved, the publisher is provided with a tracking
ID to use in affiliate ads.
Affiliate aggregators use one tracking ID per publisher, even when the publisher
has signed up with multiple merchants. But if the merchants you work with don’t
affiliate through aggregation software, they will each provide you with a unique
tracking ID for use in links.
Understanding Affiliate Programs | 121

Be sure to keep these tracking IDs so that you can retrieve them, along with logon
information for each affiliate program.
4. Creatives
The merchant supplies banner and links—collectively called creatives (see “Crea-
tives” on page 123)—that use the publisher’s tracking ID. The merchant also sup-
plies information about how to create links with the proper tracking ID to the
publisher. If the merchant-publisher connection is taking place with the facilitation
of an affiliate aggregator, then the aggregator makes it easy for publishers to obtain
links.
Banners and links are supplied as HTML code, usually complete with the pub-
lisher’s tracking ID embedded in the link, so you don’t need to know much HTML
to join an affiliate program. If you are comfortable with HTML, you can, of course,
construct your own custom links. Graphics, most often hosted on the merchant’s
site, are supplied by the merchant or affiliate aggregator.
5. Link construction
The publisher incorporates the supplied HTML in web pages and/or constructs
links based on the tracking ID that mesh well with the publisher’s content.
The plausibility of the links that the publisher constructs, their relevance to the
publisher content, and their ability to provide added value to site visitors are the
most important components in determining whether an affiliate arrangement will
make money for the publisher.
6. Clicking the affiliate links
Visitors to the publisher’s site click the banners or links that open the merchant’s
site; these links contain the tracking ID of the publisher.
7. Tracking sales
The merchant site tracks sales that are associated with users who have the pub-
lisher’s tracking ID. This mechanism is either home-brewed by the merchant site
or uses software infrastructure provided by an affiliate aggregator.
8. Placing the cookie
Usually the merchant’s site places a cookie on the visitor’s computer so that the
publisher is credited for actions that take place at a later point by the visitor. The
amount of time depends on the affiliate program, so you should check individual
affiliate program details before you sign up.
9. Reports and sales commissions
If the visitor takes a desired action—usually by buying something—the publisher
is due a commission (often, as specified in the original agreement, there’s a time
delay before any actual money is paid in order to handle issues like merchandise
returns). Reputable affiliate programs provide an easy mechanism for publishers
to keep track of page and click statistics and what they are owed. The tracking
software is managed either by the merchant or by a third-party affiliate aggregator.
122 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

Creatives
Banners, buttons, and links provided by a merchant to an affiliate publisher are gen-
erally called creatives, a term deriving from the ad agency business. (Yes, I suppose it
takes some creativity to make a good banner!) Creatives vary from fancy, splashy
graphics in the GIF format (or even made using Flash) to simple text links pointing at
a single product.
There’s a great variety in the kinds and sizes of creatives made available by merchants.
To generalize, the most common kinds of creatives are:
Text links
Simple hypertext links.
Banners
Graphic images, usually laid out horizontally. Sizes vary, but 480 × 90 pixels and
600 × 90 pixels are typical.
Skyscrapers
Graphic images intended for vertical deployment (hence the nickname skyscraper).
Typical dimensions are 120 × 600 pixels.
Buttons
Small graphical images, typically 120 × 90 pixels.
Search boxes
Search boxes combine graphics, HTML, and text to allow your site visitors to
search the merchant’s site.
Custom designs and sizes
The best affiliate merchant programs provide “instant stores” in a format specific
to the business of the merchant.
Figure 5-2 shows one of the dynamic “poster store” creatives available to affiliates of
AllPosters.com.
The best creative to use depends upon context and individual taste and what you think
will work with visitors to your site. It’s worth spending some time experimenting with
different creatives to see whether one performs better than another.
There’s a tendency on the part of people running affiliate marketing
campaigns to produce what are—in my opinion—garish creatives: ban-
ners and buttons full of movement and special effects. It’s obvious why
merchants do this—to get attention—and it is mostly no skin off their
noses if an affiliate website looks a little tasteless. But as a content pub-
lisher, you should probably avoid these kinds of creatives. Banners that
don’t flash most likely work better and won’t overwhelm your site
content.
Understanding Affiliate Programs | 123

All creatives used in affiliate marketing provide a mechanism for including the tracking
ID of the publisher, so the publisher can be credited for sales or other action events.
Affiliate marketing works best when the merchant has high appeal to the demographics
visiting a publisher’s site (see “Matching affiliates with content” on page 129). In fact,
some of the most effective affiliate links are simple text links to products that your
content discusses or recommends. For example, a digital photography website might
want to provide a link to a merchant partner selling Canon or Nikon digital cameras.
Providing links to a specific product for sale by a merchant partner in
the context of a website discussion of the product raises ethical concerns
about the separation of editorial and advertising content. Most affiliates
do it. You’ll have to resolve this for yourself, but I would suggest that
you not include positive content about a product unless you believe in
your content, and that you not direct your site vendors to a merchant
unless you would buy that product from that merchant yourself.
Figure 5-2. Merchants with good affiliate programs provide effective creatives, like this “poster store”
display from AllPosters.com
124 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

If you decide to use text links to product items, such as a Nikon D300 dSLR camera,
eventually you’ll probably need to understand where the merchant’s tracking ID goes
in the HTML used for a specific product link, as well as how to link to a specific product
within a merchant’s catalog.
For example, here’s the HTML code for an affiliate link to the B&H Photo site that
sends the visitor right to the product page for the Nikon D300 on B&H’s website:
<a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/518489-
REG/Nikon_25432_D300_SLR_Digital_Camera.html/BI/XXXX/KBID/YYYY">
buy your Nikon D300 from B&H photo
</a>
The affiliate program at B&H adds the publisher tracking IDs to the
URL for the link. In this example, an actual ID for B&H has been re-
placed with XXXX, and the ID for the affiliate aggregation software that
B&H uses to power their system replaced with YYYY.
The actual link that the B&H code creates looks just like a normal text link, as you can
see in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3. This apparently normal hyperlink is actually a creative that embeds affiliate marketing
tracking IDs and points to a specific product on the site of the merchant (B&H Photo in this case)
In the Nikon D300 example, the product is designated using its B&H product code.
The process for creating one of these links is straightforward (although you do have to
be careful to get the details right):
• Find the product code (in some cases this is made easier through the use of stand-
ardized product and SKU designations such as ISBNs and ASINs)
• Construct a hyperlink in the form the merchant requires, embedding both product
code and your tracking information
Understanding Affiliate Programs | 125

It’s perhaps surprising that text links, when correctly written, are prob-
ably the most successful form of affiliate marketing. One reason for this
may be that the commercial intent of the hyperlink is not as obvious as
when a gaudy banner is used.
An interesting point is that you should understand where the graphic (usually a JPEG
or GIF file) used in banner and button creatives is located. For example, B&H, as well
as most other major affiliate merchants, hosts these graphics itself. However, some-
times merchants do ask you to copy graphics to your own web server.
Usually, this distinction doesn’t make much difference. It’s less trouble when the
graphic is on the merchant’s site and it uses less of your own bandwidth. However, if
the merchant’s server goes down, then your site looks (and is) broken. This does happen
more often than you might expect. True, if the merchant is not serving creatives, it is
probably also not selling product, but if a graphic is missing from your site, it looks
worse for you than if a link simply doesn’t work.
Areas of Concern
The relationship between a content website and an affiliate advertiser is essentially like
that of a commission-only sales rep to a manufacturer. You’ll want to examine the same
areas that a brick-and-mortar independent sales rep would look at before agreeing to
carry a merchant’s products. Start by asking these questions:
• Does the merchant have a good reputation?
• Will the merchant honor its commitments?
• Will the merchant stay in business?
• Is there a strong—or at least reasonable—connection between this merchant and
your content?
• Will your customers want to buy the product?
• Will your customers feel that you are adding value—as opposed to trying to
profiteer—by linking to the merchant?
More specific to the Web, as I’ve mentioned in the context of hosting creatives, if a
merchant’s site goes down, then your links will be broken and you won’t be able to
earn a commission. You should feel reasonably good about the website stability of a
merchant whose affiliate program you join.
As a web “sales rep,” you should also be concerned with (and investigate as thoroughly
as possible) these issues:
• The amount of commission you will earn per event
• The adequacy of the processes for tracking your sales, crediting you, and paying
you
126 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

• The commitment of the affiliate advertiser to support its affiliate program
• The appeal of the offerings of the affiliate advertiser in relationship to the visitors
to your site
These issues are worth more discussion.
Amount of the commission
You can (and should) find out the amount of the sales commission when you sign up
for an affiliate program. There are a huge variety of commission structures, but you
should probably expect a commission of between 3 percent and 10 percent of what the
merchant receives, exclusive of shipping, handling, and sales tax.
As one of the biggest merchants on the Web, Amazon has one of the
best and most extensive affiliate programs (see “The Amazon.com As-
sociate Program” on page 148). The Amazon.com commission struc-
ture tends to be at the lower end of this range; however, note that on
nonbook items, Amazon.com is often acting as a go-between, rather
than directly selling actual merchandise.
You should take care to note precisely what action items trigger a sales commission.
Most of the time, it is a sale. However, some significant sales may be excluded, and it
is important to the health of your pocketbook to know this and not promote excluded
items.
In addition, some sites may pay commissions for qualified leads—for example, some-
one signing up for insurance and completing the paperwork—whether or not the prod-
uct actually sells (with the insurance example, underwriting wouldn’t have to take place
for you to receive your commission).
Be on the lookout for commission structures that reward you for good performance.
These kinds of programs can add bonus percentages to the commissions you make and
can be quite rewarding if you deliver substantial traffic.
In addition, some affiliate programs simply offer flat fees as incentives. For example, a
web hosting affiliate program might pay affiliates $90 each time a visitor to the affiliate
site signs up for a web hosting contract of a year or more.
$90 is, in fact, roughly the current going sales commission for an affiliate
who sends a site visitor who signs up for a web hosting contract. This
may seem like a lot to you, but customers tend to feel fairly locked into
the company that hosts their web businesses, even when they find the
customer service or technical standards don’t live up to what was
promised.
Understanding Affiliate Programs | 127

One other variation on the affiliate marketing commission sounds a great deal like a
multilevel marketing scheme (and probably is one)—not only do you get a commission
on sales generated by traffic from your site, you also get a small percentage of the sales
of any affiliate you bring in, and maybe even a share of the sales of affiliates that your
affiliates bring in.
Theoretically, these arrangements can go on ad infinitum, with potential for both ac-
counting problems and commissions, provided you get in on a scheme like this early.
However, remember the old adage that “if something sounds too good to be true, it
probably is.” I’m not saying that all such schemes are bogus or that you can’t make
money from them. However, this kind of arrangement does not denote the quality and
long-term partner you should be looking for.
Also note that, depending upon the program, commission payout usually does not take
place right away. Most affiliate programs build some time in for product returns (or
buyer’s remorse). Once it is clear that there will not be any returns, it can still be 30 to
90 days before you are paid. The “float” on the money is simply part of the profit to
the merchant and you have to build it into your expectations.
Sales and commission tracking
Sales and commission tracking is a serious issue. It’s very important to most affiliate
site publishers. If you don’t know that transactions originating from your site are being
consistently tracked, then you have no way to be assured that you will be paid the
commissions you are owed.
This implies that you should be careful to work only with third-party affiliate aggre-
gators (see “Benefits of Affiliate Aggregators” on page 130) or enroll in programs man-
aged by an extremely reliable vendor, such as Amazon.com (see “The Amazon.com
Associate Program” on page 148).
Testing Links by Buying
If possible, you should test that each affiliate link on your site works by buying some-
thing and making sure that your sales commission shows up when you check the track-
ing software. You’d be amazed at the number of times a problem with the linkage or
the accounting is revealed by doing this!
In some cases, the Terms of Service (TOS) prohibit you from buying merchandise using
your own affiliate links. Other merchants encourage you to buy with your affiliate links,
so this just varies from merchant to merchant. You need to check the TOS carefully so
you can be sure you are in compliance.
If the TOS of a merchant your site is affiliated with prohibits you from personally buying
through your affiliate link, get a friend to buy something small. It’s worth checking that
the link and reporting mechanism is working, and you can always think of this as
something like your own “secret shopper” program.
128 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

Merchant support of affiliate programs
Will the merchant support your efforts with good promotions, incentives, and crea-
tives? Ideally, an affiliate relationship is a long-term partnership. You’d like to know
that the merchant supporting the affiliate program is in it for the long haul. Merchant
support of affiliate programs makes a big difference in the following areas:
• To make an affiliate program work well, you’ll want to be able to provide value to
your site visitors in terms of special promotions. These promotions often work well
if they are seasonal, but it’s really helpful if you can also offer your site visitors a
deal that they can’t get anywhere else.
• If you put great effort into an affiliate program and perform well, you should be
rewarded with incentives. These incentives typically take the form of a step-up in
commission after reaching a volume of sale benchmarks.
• To keep your site visitors coming back to an affiliated merchant, you need a steady
stream of quality, fresh creatives. The merchant should be willing to work with
you if none of their existing creatives fit the look and feel of your site design. If the
merchant has a large inventory, the creatives should deliver the ability to go straight
to a particular item, as well as the possibility of implementing a search through the
entire inventory.
Matching affiliates with content
Perhaps the single biggest factor in successful affiliate marketing is the alignment of the
content of your site with the affiliate merchant’s offerings. In other words, visitors to
your site should be genuinely interested in the products the merchant has to sell.
You’ll have a tough row to hoe if you try to sell cosmetics to visitors of a digital pho-
tography site, but you should find it easier to sell these visitors digital photo equipment
and processing services. Visitors to a site that provides technical services of use to web-
masters are likely candidates for web hosting affiliate programs, but unlikely to buy
lingerie or refrigerators.
In the brick-and-mortar world, there used to be talk about a salesperson who could
“sell ice to the Inuit.” No website can sell as well as this proverbial salesperson, so you
need to use common sense and devise an intelligent strategy to provide affiliate links
to products and services that are relevant to your site visitors. Relevant links get clicked,
goods get purchased, and publishers get their commissions. Relevance and referrals to
quality merchant partners get you a long way toward providing added value when you
publish links to an affiliate merchant.
More than any other form of website advertising monetization, affiliate marketing re-
quires careful honing of site content with an intelligent choice of partners and creatives.
Understanding Affiliate Programs | 129

Working with an Affiliate Program
Generally, there are three affiliate marketing situations you may get involved with as a
web content publisher:
• The affiliate program is managed by an affiliate aggregator (see “Benefits of Affiliate
Aggregators” next).
• An extremely well-known entity offers a broad and well-thought-out affiliate
program. The Amazon.com Associate Program is probably the best example, as
explained in “The Amazon.com Associate Program” on page 148; both AllPost-
ers.com and B&H Photo, mentioned earlier in this chapter, are very well-known
and successful businesses with affiliate marketing programs.
• A vendor with a limited line of products or services starts its own affiliate marketing
program (see “Ad Hoc Affiliation” on page 145).
Benefits of Affiliate Aggregators
Major affiliate aggregators provide the following benefits to web publishers:
• The publisher can use “one-stop shopping” to work with many different
merchants.
• There’s only one software interface to learn.
• Reporting and commission payments are consolidated.
• A third party (the aggregator) provides consistent tracking software and provides
some recourse in case of disputes over sales.
Of course, from the viewpoint of the merchant, there are some major benefits as well;
primarily:
• Off-loading the complex business of tracking and reporting the numerous trans-
actions to accurately pay sales commissions
• Being able to attract more affiliate sites through the site of the aggregator
Don’t forget: affiliate aggregators are paid by merchants, not publishers.
They exist to provide a service to merchants who want to effectively
manage affiliate programs without having to roll their own. They pri-
marily represent the interests of the merchants who are their clients, not
the interests of the affiliates.
You’ll need at least one content-based website to enroll with an affiliate aggregator.
Once you’ve signed up with an affiliate aggregator, the aggregator will provide access
to a single website that allows you to:
130 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

• Apply to individual merchant affiliate programs
• Get HTML for creatives
• Generate activity reports
It’s pretty easy to add multiple websites to your account with an affiliate
aggregator once you have obtained an initial account. This is such an
important point that it is worth rephrasing and repeating: as a publisher,
you can use a single account with an affiliate aggregator to manage your
relationship with multiple merchants and multiple content websites. It’s
also, as I’ve noted, one of the primary benefits to merchants.
Nothing good, however, comes without some potential risks. In this
case, there is the possibility that if you create very successful programs,
and all of your efforts use the same ID, your competitors will find out.
Like a good fishing hole, some good affiliate programs are easily spoiled
once the word gets out.
Finding an Affiliate Aggregator
Probably the three most active and well-known affiliate aggregators at the time of pub-
lication are Commission Junction, Kolimbo, and LinkShare. Each of these is described
in this section. In addition, you’ll find more affiliate programs listed in the Open Di-
rectory Project in the Affiliate Networks category and in the Yahoo! Directory in the
Web Site Affiliates category.
At the time of this writing, there are rumors that Microsoft will be in-
troducing an affiliate network. If so, it would certainly introduce a bigger
player and a new element to this space.
Commission Junction
Commission Junction represents more than 1,000 merchants, ranging from Buy.com
and Discover Card to Half.com, dating sites, software publishers, and companies sell-
ing clothes—just about any kind of merchant you can imagine. Owned by NASDAQ-
traded ValueClick, if any legitimate product or service can be bought over the Internet,
you can probably figure out a way to make a sales commission from selling it via Com-
mission Junction.
The signup procedure for Commission Junction is pretty simple. You give them a con-
tent website, description, and your personal contact info. Once you’ve agreed to the
Terms of Service and verified your email address, you can logon to the site. Before you
can add affiliate links to your site, you need to complete an electronic W-9 (for busi-
nesses in the United States) and provide a SSN or TIN.
The Commission Junction home page is shown in Figure 5-4.
Working with an Affiliate Program | 131

Figure 5-4. The Commission Junction home page lets you access much of the program’s functionality
from a single window
By choosing Account – Web Site Settings, you can add a new website for deployment
with the Commission Junction affiliate programs or change the information about your
current site (Figure 5-5).
If you look carefully at Figure 5-5, you’ll notice that a PID has been
assigned as a site setting. The PID is the number that Commission Junc-
tion uses as its tracking ID.
The Run Reports tab, shown in Figure 5-6, provides a very complete set of metrics
covering how many times ads have been displayed on your pages (called page impres-
sions), how many times your ads have been clicked (called click throughs), and the sales
commissions you have earned.
132 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

The heart of the Commission Junction interface is the Get Links tab, shown in Fig-
ure 5-7.
Using the Get Links tab, you can find merchants—called advertisers by Commission
Junction—by category, by searching using various filters, or by listing the merchants
with whom you have an existing relationship. You can browse the entire list of Com-
mission Junction merchants by clicking Advertiser List. You can also do a search based
on the name of a specific advertiser.
Once you’ve found a merchant you are interested in, you can apply to join the mer-
chant’s affiliate program by checking the program application box and clicking Apply
to Program, as shown in Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-5. It’s easy to add websites to your Commission Junction account or edit current site
information

your page views, transactions, and sales
Working with an Affiliate Program | 133

Figure 5-7. Using the Get Links tab, you can search for participating merchants by category
Figure 5-8. Check the box and click Apply to Program to join a merchant’s affiliate program
You can view the creatives a merchant provides, the merchant catalog
of inventory items (if applicable), and statistics such as earnings per click
(EPC) before you join a program.
Your application to join a merchant program will be approved either automatically (if
the merchant has decided to approve all would-be affiliates) or manually. During the
manual approval process, which may take up to several days, your status with the
134 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

merchant is set to “Pending Approval.” With manual approval, you will be notified by
email whether you’ve been accepted or rejected.
These days, more and more applications to become affiliates are not
automatically approved. This is a reaction to the huge increase in spam
the Internet has seen, and you should not read anything personal into
it. Businesses need to protect their image. The vast majority of appro-
priate websites are approved as affiliates, although the process takes a
bit more time than it used to.
Once a merchant has approved your application to join its affiliate program, you can
grab the HTML required to make links. To do this, use one of the mechanisms provided
by the Get Links tab to find the merchant that you have the relationship with.
If you are responsible for web content across more than a couple of sites, you know it
can be tough to keep track of content details. Merchant relationships are no exception.
A good approach to finding the merchants who have approved your affiliate application
is to open the Get Links – By Relationship page shown in Figure 5-9.
Figure 5-9. You can use the Get Links – By Relationship page to display all the merchants who have
approved your affiliate account
Working with an Affiliate Program | 135

Locate the merchant you want to add to your site. Click View Links. You can now scan
all the creatives offered by the merchant. For example, Figure 5-10 shows some of the
creatives offered to participating affiliates by Henry & June Lingerie.
Figure 5-10. You can view all the creatives supplied by a merchant to decide which ones will work
best for your site
To grab the HTML for a specific creative, either click the creative or check the box next
to it and click the Get HTML link to the right of the page. In either case, a Get HTML
window, like the one shown in Figure 5-11, will open.
If you are managing multiple websites, make sure to select the right one
on the website drop-down list before copying HTML. You can also use
the Get HTML window to set a variety of options, notably setting the
affiliate link to open a new browser window (an important choice be-
cause it helps to keep visitors on your site longer).
136 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

The HTML for the new affiliate link is pretty simple and includes the web publisher’s
PID (tracking identification) as part of the link:
<a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-3282274-156060" target="_top"><img
src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-3282274-156060" width="234" height="60" alt="Shop
for sexy lingerie at Henry and June" border="0"/></a>
If you paste this HTML into the code for your web page, the new creative will now
appear on your site.
Figure 5-11. The Get HTML window lets you copy the HTML for a specific creative
Alternatively, you can display the affiliate link using JavaScript. To get the appropriate
code, click Get JavaScript (instead of Get HTML). A new window will open as shown
in Figure 5-12.
There’s not much functional difference between the HTML and Java-
Script approaches, so this is essentially an issue of your preference and
style as a webmaster.
Working with an Affiliate Program | 137

Here’s the corresponding JavaScript code:
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"
src="http://www.tkqlhce.com/placeholder-3456743?target=_top&mouseover=N"></script>
Figure 5-12. If you prefer, you can load the creative and affiliate link using remotely hosted JavaScript
code
To maximize affiliate revenue, it’s important to constantly tweak ads—
for example, to respond to seasonal conditions such as holidays. To
facilitate ad changes across a range of pages, it’s important to use an
architecture that facilitates flexibility of presentation, as explained in
Chapter 1.
Kolimbo
Kolimbo bills itself as the “open” alternative to closed affiliate network sites:
Both affiliates and merchants can work with whomever they choose, on their own
terms.... Unlike traditional networks that tend to be more controlling over the affiliate–
138 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

merchant relationship, Kolimbo merchants have full access to all data about their affili-
ates. This allows merchants the opportunity to work closely with their affiliates to help
build a profitable long-term relationship for both parties.
While Kolimbo is probably in more widespread use as infrastructure software for one-
off merchants like B&H Photo than as an affiliate relationship marketplace, there are
still plenty of merchants you can find, as you can see on the Find New Programs index
page shown in Figure 5-13.
Figure 5-13. Many categories of merchant programs are represented in the Kolimbo “open” affiliate
marketplace
The mechanics of working with Kolimbo as a publisher don’t differ that much from
other affiliate aggregators like Commission Junction, except that reporting and com-
Working with an Affiliate Program | 139

mission payments are between individual merchants and publishers. You sign up,
providing a website, description, and taxpayer information. Next, you apply for mer-
chant programs, some of which automatically approve anyone, while others require
manual approval.
To integrate the merchant links with your site, you grab graphics and code containing
your tracking ID, like the creatives for the March of Dimes shown in Figure 5-14.
Figure 5-14. Not all affiliate marketing is about money; if traffic you direct to the March of Dimes
results in a donation, you will get an acknowledgment (and the good feeling that comes from having
helped babies)
LinkShare
LinkShare is the oldest major affiliate aggregator, currently representing several hun-
dred merchants ranging from American Express to iTunes to Macy’s and beyond.
Owned by Rakuten, a publicly traded Japanese company, LinkShare provides roughly
the same functionality as Commission Junction.
140 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

The LinkShare home page is shown in Figure 5-15.
Figure 5-15. From the LinkShare home page you can browse merchants, join programs, generate
links, and more
Within LinkShare, you’ll find five tabbed windows in addition to the home page:
Programs
Used to apply for approval to merchant’s affiliate program (as with the merchant
members of Commission Junction, some approvals will be automatic and some
will be manual)
Links
Used to build and select merchant creatives (requires prior acceptance in a mer-
chant’s affiliate program)
Reports
Used to generate detailed reports about site and program metrics
Messages
Provides an email system for communication between publishers, merchants, and
LinkShare
Working with an Affiliate Program | 141

My Account
Used to change account information (for example, add a domain)
To obtain a creative, click the Create Link tab (you can also navigate to this point by
clicking the My Advertisers tab on the Programs page). A list of the affiliate programs
for which you have been approved appears (Figure 5-16).
Figure 5-16. You can create links only if you have been approved for a merchant’s affiliate program
If you have registered multiple websites with LinkShare, be sure the one
you want to use the creative with is selected from the drop-down list
that will appear at the top of the page.
142 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

Click the name of the merchant you’d like to link with—for example, Sierra Trading
Post, a discount retailer of sporting goods and clothes. A page that will let you generate
creatives specifically for Sierra Trading Post will open. Choose the kind of creative you’d
like to create from the Available Link Types box, shown in Figure 5-17.
Figure 5-17. Link types range from straight text to search boxes, banners, and more
The Dynamic Rich Media category tends to produce creatives that are
“blue plate specials,” such as rotating deals of the day.
For example, suppose you want to add a box to your website that searches the Sierra
Trading Post product database. To do this, you’d click the Search Box link. A page
showing a number of possible search boxes, such as the one shown in Figure 5-18, will
open.
To add the search box to your site, copy the code and paste it into your page. Here’s

The Sierra Trading Post search box code consists of an HTML form
formatted using table tags. The value of the affiliate tracking ID is passed
using a hidden form variable named id.
With this code pasted into your web page, the Sierra Trading Post search box will
appear on your site.
If a visitor to your site enters a specific item—for example, men’s socks—in the search
box and clicks Search Sierra Trading Post, the results page for the item will open
(Figure 5-19). This helps to increase the rate of conversion of clicks to sales because
visitors are looking only at items they have some interest in, which therefore increases
the likelihood that you will make a commission.
Ad Hoc Affiliation
From A to Z, with stops along the way for Viagra and web hosting, there are a great
many merchants that offer their own affiliation programs. I started this chapter with
an explanation of how affiliation works with examples from two of the bigger mer-
chants on the Web: AllPosters.com and B&H Photo. But there are also many quirky,
independent, and smaller merchants you can affiliate with that may actually be better
commercial opportunities for your specific site.
You might want to affiliate with an individual merchant for one or more of these
reasons:
• You know and appreciate the merchant and the merchant’s product or service.
• You believe your site visitors will buy from the merchant.
• You can’t find comparable offerings through an affiliate aggregator.
Working with an Affiliate Program | 145

Figure 5-19. Providing a way to search a merchant’s inventory increases sales because customers can
find the items they are interested in
But bear in mind the good reasons for working through a single aggregator rather than
multiple individual affiliates:
• Third-party oversight of sales tracking and commission payment
• Fewer administrative headaches with only one or two programs to work with
• Stability and reliability of merchants and program administration
146 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

A merchant that provides its own affiliation tracking (and related tools) generally pro-
vides the most important functionality, such as that you’ll find at Amazon.com or one
of the aggregators, but when you work one-on-one with a merchant, you may find that
systems are not as smooth as when you work with an affiliate aggregator or an estab-
lished “super-store” merchant like Amazon. Still, it’s perfectly feasible to work with
smaller merchants. If you choose your merchants wisely, monitor your sales commis-
sion accounts, and match your content to the merchants you choose, you should be
able to do well. Here are two different examples of specialty merchants with whom it
might make sense to work.
If you don’t see your sales being recorded, find out why and get the
merchant to fix the problem.
Fred Miranda Software
Fred Miranda Software makes inexpensive plug-ins for advanced users of Photoshop.
This specialty product fits very well with a content site focusing on serious photogra-
phy, particularly when the affiliate link to Fred Miranda can be put in the context of a
specific problem and solution, as shown in Figure 5-20.
Figure 5-20. Embedding a specialty affiliate link in the context of the solution to a task often works well
iContact
In Chapter 3, I described the benefits of using a specialty service such as iContact to
manage your email marketing. It probably will not surprise you to learn that iContact
has its own affiliate marketing program. And what better place to embed affiliate links
for an email marketing solution than in your own HTML marketing emails?
From a coding viewpoint, the mechanism for embedding an affiliate link in an HTML
email is precisely the same as it is for placing the link in an HTML web page.
Figure 5-21 shows iContact affiliate creative and text links in the footer of an HTML
email newsletter.
Working with an Affiliate Program | 147

Figure 5-21. You can easily embed HTML affiliate links in HTML marketing emails
The Amazon.com Associate Program
If you belong to just one merchant’s affiliate program, Amazon.com is probably the
one to join.
In Amazon’s terminology, affiliates are called associates, just as the sales
help at a brick-and-mortar Wal-Mart (and other fine stores) are also
associates. Becoming an Amazon associate sounds like the better of the
two options to me, but then I am a virtual kind of guy!
Amazon makes a great partner for an affiliate (particularly if the affiliate is only going
to be associated with one merchant program) for a number of reasons, including:
• Amazon is one of the oldest businesses on the Web.
• Amazon has a great reputation with customers for reliability and fair dealing.
148 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

• Amazon—at times in combination with partner merchants—can supply almost
any conceivable product to your customers.
• Amazon.com provides creatives with great variety and flexibility; it’s easy to use
them to link to any product or Amazon.com search result, and the creatives fit well
with most site designs.
• An Amazon-supplied widget allows your customers to search almost any part of
the vast Amazon inventory.
• Amazon’s “site stripe” allows you to easily link to any page on Amazon you happen
to visit.
• Amazon’s seasonal promotions—at Christmas, for example—are incredibly
effective.
Quick-and-Dirty Amazon Text Links
As many webmasters know, it’s perfectly possible to build your own Amazon text links
without visiting the Amazon site simply by inserting your own Amazon identifier in the
link example, along with the ISBN or ASIN of the book or product you want to link to.
It’s quick and dirty, but the hyperlink http://www.Amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=
0596529880/XXXXXXXXX/ points to one of my books by ISBN with an Amazon.com
affiliate ID (represented in the link by XXXXXXXXX.) If sales result from this link,
Amazon will know to credit me.
If you create a link like this, you’ll want to substitute your own account identification
and change the ISBN to point to a book you are interested in. (Of course, I don’t object
if you just want to link to my book!)
To link to a product rather than a book, use the form ASIN=asin number in the URL.
The application process for becoming an Amazon associate can be accessed at https://
associates.Amazon.com/gp/flex/associates/apply-login.html. Essentially, Amazon.com
approves all applicants who provide a valid email address and the required Social Se-
curity number (or EIN).
Amazon pays between 4 percent and 10 percent sales commissions, with the bulk of
the commissions in the 4 percent to 7 percent range. In some cases, performance
bonuses are given to affiliates who are extraordinary producers.
As is the case with many lucrative programs on the Web, Amazon
doesn’t spell out the precise percentages that you get. (In this respect,
Google AdSense operates in the same way.) You just have to trust in the
fairness of Amazon (and Google), which, for the most part, works out.
Working with an Affiliate Program | 149

The home page for the Amazon Associate program, called Amazon Associates Central,
is located at http://associates.Amazon.com. Once you’ve joined the program, you can
log in to update your account information, generate reports, and obtain creatives.
Click Build Links to specify creatives and obtain the corresponding code. There are five
varieties of Amazon creatives:
Product links
Link to a specific product that you select and display a product image
Recommended links
Link to Amazon recommendations by product category or keywords
Banners
Wide variety of banners, both rotating special promotions and by shopping
category
Text links
Text link to any Amazon page, such as a product page or a page that results from
an Amazon search
Search boxes
You can put an Amazon search box on your site
Figure 5-22 shows the launch panel for building this wide selection of creatives at
Amazon.
For example, suppose you want to add a box on your digital photography site that will
display a digital camera that Amazon recommends (and let Amazon take care of the
specifics of which camera is highlighted).
To start, click Build Links with Recommended Product Links selected. The Choose
Content panel, shown in Figure 5-23, will open.
In the Choose Content panel, select a product line and enter keywords or choose a
subcategory. For example: if “Camera & Photo” is the primary category, “Digital Cam-
eras” might be a good subcategory (but you could also limit the recommendations to
a specific brand by entering “Nikon,” “digital,” and “camera” as keywords rather than
selecting a subcategory).
With a content type selected, click Continue. You’ll next be asked to select a size for
the creative. With a size selected, you can now move to final adjustments (for example,
to the colors used in the text and background of the creative) and copy the HTML,
using the window shown in Figure 5-24.

XXXXXXXXX.
Figure 5-24. By clicking the links shown, you can customize the creative or just copy the HTML for
use on your site
152 | Chapter 5: Making Money with Affiliate Programs

Once the HTML is copied to your site, the creative will appear to your site visitors.
With a Recommended Product creative that refers to a category of
products, Amazon automatically rotates the actual products that are
displayed in its creative.
Action Items
Here are some action items for you to consider in order to make money from your web
content with affiliate programs:
• Understand the mechanics of affiliation
• Identify merchants with affiliate programs that mesh well with your content
• Evaluate affiliate programs
• Explore, and sign up with, affiliate aggregators

CHAPTER 6
Making Money by Hosting Advertising
If you think about how you live your life, there’s a spectrum of activity levels from
sleeping to moving briskly and perhaps even running. Advertising on the Web is struc-
tured with a similar activity-level spectrum, although the activities themselves may not
be very aerobic.
At the briskest, a visitor to your site must click on a merchant’s link. You only get paid
when the visitor actually buys something from the merchant. This is affiliate advertis-
ing, explained in Chapter 5.
CPC—cost per click—advertising is one of the most common ways to make money by
accepting ads on your site. With CPC, an advertiser pays a fee when someone clicks its
link on your site, and you get a portion of that fee. CPC ads are mostly (although they
don’t have to be) text-only. While CPC is most commonly associated with advertising
using programs such as AdWords, the concept of CPC is fundamental to both search-
based AdWords and content hosted via programs such as Google AdSense.
The idea of making ads contextual—that is, relevant to the content of the web page
near the ad—is closely bound with CPC advertising. CPC ads that are contextual are
much more effective, and generate more revenue for a site owner, than ads that are not
contextual. But it is worth bearing in mind that you can have CPC ads that are not
contextual, and conversely, contextual ads that pay on some other basis than CPC.
Like affiliate advertising, something has to happen with CPC, but not as much—the
visitor doesn’t need to actually consummate a purchase, just click on the advertiser’s
link.
Display ads—also called CPM, for reasons explained later in this chapter—are the
passive, television-viewing form of web advertising activity. A visitor to your site doesn’t
have to do a thing (except possibly to surf past the display ad on your site with minor
irritation). No activity on the part of your site visitor is required, and all you need to
do is to serve the ads.
This chapter explains how you can profit from CPC and CPM ads, with the emphasis
on CPC (as it is generally on the Web).
155

Understanding Cost Per Click (CPC)
When you first start working with a CPC program as a website publisher, you will
encounter some terms that may not be familiar to you. These concepts are actually
pretty straightforward, so it makes sense to start a discussion of CPC by looking at the
definitions of the most important terms you may not know or may mean something
that is slightly different than in normal usage.
The point here is to not get thrown by language and terminology. If you were about to
begin working with a complicated technology, you would expect to have to learn un-
familiar concepts and words. Whether you are implementing a for-profit advertising
system yourself, or are working with outside experts, knowing the language is a big
step toward success.
Google is the 10,000-pound gorilla when it comes to CPC, both for
advertising and hosting advertising. Since Google’s CPC ad-hosting
program, AdSense, is the primary subject of Part II of this book, in this
chapter Google is just treated as “one of the gang,” even though it is
hard to avoid the long shadow Google casts. The idea is to show you
the general concepts of CPC and give you a sense of the range of the
industry.
Here are some of the most commonly used terms in the CPC industry:
Ad unit
A group of ads, often from one to six text-only contextual ads, but sometimes only
presenting links to the actual ads. Typically, ad units are served off the site of the
advertising agency (for example, Google). This is most often accomplished using
a script. You get the code on the agency website, as shown in Figure 6-1. While
you can choose a variety of options related to the appearance of the ad unit, typi-
cally the choice of ads served is up to the agency.
Click
A click occurs when a site visitor to your web page clicks on a link in an ad that
was served by an ad unit on your site. Not all clicks generate revenue (for example,
most clicks on public service ads don’t pay you anything).
The click is the basis for all CPC ad programs and an extremely important metric.
Click fraud
A click made without actual interest in the product or services offered. For example,
clicks by a site publisher on the ads on a site or on the ads of a competitor (to jack
up advertising costs for the competitor).
Click fraud, and click fraud detection, is extremely serious in CPC programs be-
cause money is at stake, and direct click fraud detection is virtually impossible.
Click fraud detection programs employ primarily statistical methodology. This
156 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

implies that you need to monitor your clicks and click-through rates for aberra-
tional rates and suspicious patterns.
Figure 6-1. Once an ad unit is placed on your site, ads are chosen by the ad agency
Cost per click (CPC)
Online advertising where there’s a cost only when a visitor clicks on the ad; syno-
nym for pay per click (PPC).
Cost per mille (CPM)
Cost per mille (CPM), meaning cost per thousand impressions, is the industry
metric used to contract and pay for display ads that are served to visitors. For more
on CPM, see “Display and Banner Ads” on page 176.
Click-through rate (CTR)
The number of clicks an ad unit receives divided by the number of times it is shown,
expressed as a percentage.
Consider that a direct “snail mail” campaign is considered a huge success with a
response rate of .01 percent or .02 percent. The CTR for properly crafted CPC ads
should be considerably higher. If your CTR is less than 0.25 percent, you should
see if you can troubleshoot the problem, which may have to do with ad placement
on your pages, design of the ads and of your pages, your traffic (its interests and
where it is coming from), keyword targeting for the ads on your page, and the
content of the ads themselves.
Effective cost per thousand impressions (eCPM)
eCPM is a way to compare revenue from different kinds of advertising. eCPM is
calculated by dividing the total earnings from an ad by its impressions in thousands.
In other words, a nominal or theoretic cost is calculated on a CPC ad as if it were
a CPM ad. You can use this calculation to compare CPC revenue with CPM revenue
to see which is a better deal, given your site content and traffic.
Understanding Cost Per Click (CPC) | 157

Impression
Short for ad impression; the number of times an ad is displayed. This is advertising
industry terminology left over from the days when magazines and newspapers were
what advertising was all about, and an impression was a literal impression of ink
on a page.
Page CTR
The click-through rate (CTR) averaged for all the ads served on an individual web
page.
Page eCPM
The eCPM for an individual web page. In other words, take a page with a number
of CPC ads, add them, divide by the number of ads, and calculate the nominal
revenue if it has been expressed in CPM terms.
Page impressions
The number of times a single web page is displayed.
Pay per click (PPC)
Pay per click is another term for CPC.
Public service ad (PSA)
Public service ads are often served before relevant content has been specifically
targeted on a site (the site owner can decide to show the PSA ads in their unit rather
than have a blank area of their page or site).
Contextual Relevance
The holy grail of advertising is to have a prospect interested in your product, and have
an ad targeted to that prospect just at the moment he is researching the product. Put
another way, suppose you decide you need a new toothbrush. On the way to the drug-
store, you hear a radio ad or see a billboard specifically extolling one brand of tooth-
brush. This is potentially powerful stuff, and something that the relevance engines
behind CPC programs make easy. After all, when you hit a page of information about
toothbrushes after searching for them online, Google knows you are interested in
toothbrushes and can easily serve appropriate ads.
The basis of CPC advertising is having visitors to your website click the links presented
to them by ads. People are likely to notice ads, and click on ad links, only if the content
of the ad is relevant to their current interests. This leads to the notion of contextually
relevant advertising (usually referred to simply as contextual advertising) often being
confused with CPC advertising, even though the two are not the same.
Contextual advertising, which as I’ve noted need not be CPC, but often is, hopes to
target a specific individual visiting a website (or page within a website). More accu-
rately, it is the web page itself that is being targeted. A contextual advertising system
scans the text of a website for keywords and returns advertisements to the web page
based on the website (see Figure 6-2). To some degree, it is possible that the advertising
158 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

system knows something about this specific visitor, but most likely the analysis is
simply based on a general evaluation of the page.
Figure 6-2. The program that generates the contextual ads tries to figure out which ads are relevant
and then generates the HTML to display them on your web page
There are a number of forms that contextual ads can take. Besides text ads with links
and banner displays, contextual advertisements may be displayed as pop ups, rollovers,
and so on. Note, once again, that contextually relevant ads need not be paid for on a
CPC basis, but usually are because of the encouraging CTR.
While CPC ads don’t have to be contextually relevant, totally unrelated
ads look odd on a web page and are unlikely to be clicked. How often
would you interrupt your train of thought to click on an ad for “contact
lens cleaner” when you are reading a site about C# programming? As a
website publisher, you are better off sticking with CPC programs that
do, in fact, provide reasonably good contextual placement.
For example, if someone is visiting a website that covers digital photography, they are
likely to see contextually relevant ads for cameras, memory cards, processing services,
and so on. More professional-oriented digital photography sites might have contextual
relevance for portfolio reviews and other services aimed at advanced photographers.
Contextual Relevance | 159

Contextually relevant ads show up on search results pages, not just on
web content pages. In fact, these ads have somewhat better CTR on
search results pages than they do on content pages—because you know
the viewer actively engaged in a search for the term that is used as the
basis for contextual relevance.
How Good Is the Context?
How good is contextual analysis? The short answer is that most of the time it is pretty
good, but when it goofs it can be a lulu.
It’s completely appropriate to display an ad for a Microsoft developer’s site on a web
page devoted to C# programming (C# is one of Microsoft’s languages for developers).
However, sometimes the engine that figures out contextual relevance is just way off
base. Most often, the cause is reliance on a keyword that doesn’t really represent the
content of a page. Here’s an actual example: in a web page about digital photography,
one photograph (of many shown) was captioned to indicate that it showed a child in
a bathtub. The Google AdSense contextual ads for the page were for plumbing supplies,
claw-foot bathtubs, and so on—all utterly unrelated to the content of the page (and
ignoring the real context of the mention of the word bathtub, which was about the
photograph, not the tub).
Another—and somewhat notorious—example: consider the news media account of a
gruesome crime spree along the Pacific Northwest coast that led to severed feet being
washed up on beaches. Some news agencies that ran the story also carried contextual
banner ads for a moving company, PutUpYourFeet.com. The only connection between
the content and the ad were the keywords “foot” and “feet.”
From the viewpoint of cost, depending on whether the PutUpYourFeet.com ad was
CPM or CPC, this ad placement didn’t cost much (if it was CPC, it wouldn’t have cost
anything to the advertiser, or paid anything to the site, because one assumes no one
genuine would click through). However, it’s very damaging to the reputation of both
the advertisers and the site to run such an inappropriate ad.
Technically, the PutUpYourFeet.com ad was an error because it was out of context.
But what about an ad that is in context but tasteless—for example, a strident life in-
surance ad on a story about a prominent death? (This has actually happened.)
The contextual engines may have gotten the life insurance ad on the celebrity obituary
technically right—the connection is the keyword “death” and related phrases. But,
depending somewhat on the ad, the placement will strike most people as tasteless.
Whether or not it leads to clicks through, it is a placement that damages the reputation
of the website and the advertiser.
160 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

The mechanisms for intervention that might stop something like this from going to
press in a newspaper are essentially not present when automated ads are served on the
Web. Human beings don’t monitor the ad placements and software analysis is not
subtle enough to pick up on nuances that form the boundary between effective and
offensive to human beings.
Premium Google AdSense accounts, meaning those with more than 5 million page
views per month, have some mechanisms for controlling ad subject matter, but short
of having this kind of clout, the best way to direct the content of ads on your page is
to construct your web pages following the guidelines explained in Chapter 4 and to
provide a contextually accurate list of alt tags for images and meta tags for pages. In
addition, most CPC programs (including AdSense) have a mechanism for filtering out
competitive ads (see Chapter 8). You can use a competitive ad filter mechanism to help
keep advertising appropriate. But the reality is that if you publish a lot of content,
sometimes contextual analysis gets it wrong and there’s not much you can do about it.
A related issue comes up when your web pages feature controversial material and ads
are placed by opponents of your viewpoint. For example, I wrote a series of blog posts
blasting the rhetoric around “intelligent design.” These posts kept drawing ads from
antievolutionists; in other words, people and organizations diametrically opposed to
my viewpoint.
Although, as I mentioned, AdSense and other contextual programs do allow you to
block specific web domains from advertising on your site (this is supposed to be used
to keep competitors off your site), there’s nothing much you can do about advertisers
with ideology you don’t like, except grin about the fact that if anyone clicks, the ad-
vertiser is paying for a context that will most likely be counterproductive for its ads. So
maybe straying from contextual relevancy is its own best reward after all.
Serving Ads
How are ads placed on contextually relevant pages? As you can imagine, it isn’t done
by a roomful of gnomes scanning web pages and deciding what ads should go on them.
There are simply too many websites and web pages, and their content changes too
quickly, for this to work (even if you had plenty of gnomes).
Even with print media, such as newspapers and magazines, it makes
sense to position advertising near contextually relevant editorial mate-
rial (although it is not always possible). The manual mechanism that I
mock (albeit using humans instead of gnomes) has always been used to
try to come up with the best placement of ads, called ad imposition, in
traditional print media.
Contextual Relevance | 161

Obviously, software, not gnomes, is used to automatically analyze the content of a web
page to determine its content and which contextually relevant ads should be placed on
it. This is fortunate for Google (and other search engine companies) because
determining the content of a site for contextual ad relevancy is essentially the same task
as determining the content of a site to match with the keywords used in a search.
To make it easier for Google’s AdSense and other contextual ad pro-
grams to accurately determine the content of your web pages, it’s im-
portant that you follow the guidelines for website and page optimization
explained in Chapter 4.
Here’s how the process of placing a contextually relevant CPC ad on your site works
in a little more detail than I previously provided:
• A block of code on your web page calls a script on the server provided by the
contextual ad program. This code also contains your tracking ID (discussed in
Chapter 8) so the ad program knows who to pay when the ads are clicked.
• This code is activated when users load your web page in their web browser.
• The activated code invokes the script on the server. The content of your page has
been analyzed. This process usually involves some time delay the first time; generic
ads may appear until the server has had time to look at your web page. Once your
page has been analyzed, the server doesn’t have to parse it again (unless the page
content changes, in which case there may be a time lag before the contextual ads
have caught up with the new content).
• The software decides which ads to serve based on its analysis of your web page
content.
• The designated ads are generated as HTML and served on your page.
These logistics behind serving contextual ads were shown earlier in Figure 6-2.
There’s a separate piece of this system that these steps don’t describe: how the system
on the server determines which ads go with particular pages or sites.
Taking Google as an example, Google has a specific web crawler, the MediaBot, which
downloads web pages. The job of the software behind the crawler is to analyze the
pages and reduce them to prioritized keyword lists. When the ad unit code on a specific
page is loaded, the software compares the keyword list associated with the page with
a ranked list of ads to serve for those keywords. This scheme is shown in Figure 6-3.
162 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

Figure 6-3. The MediaBot analyzes web content; a keyword match is used to determine which ad from
the inventory is served
Dollars and Cents
The amount of money generated by an individual click on a contextual ad is a highly
variable and murky business. In the case of Google and other contextual programs, the
amount that is paid for an ad depends on an automated bidding process where adver-
tisers bid for keywords. So the amount paid for a contextual ad varies day by day and
even hour by hour.
Google’s Terms of Service (TOS) forbids the disclosure of any financial
information about how much is made off the AdSense contextual ad
program except an accurate account of the total paid to a publisher.
Essentially, a contextual ad program such as Google is acting as an agent or a broker.
In old-fashioned language, the role is an automated advertising agency.
Ads are sold by keyword to advertisers, and publishers are paid on the basis of click
throughs (see Chapter 7 for the details of Google’s role as a broker). But Google doesn’t
say what percentage commission it takes, or what share of the pie it leaves for you, the
web publisher. If you sign up for Google’s AdSense, the leading contextual ad program,
you just have to take what Google gives you, and trust Google.
Furthermore, the percentage of the fee paid by the advertisers isn’t generally disclosed
by most contextual ad agencies. It usually ranges between 30 percent and 70 percent.
(I know; that’s a pretty big range!)
Contextual Relevance | 163

An individual click on a contextual ad is not going to make you rich. The net value to
a web publisher of a click ranges from one or two pennies to a few dollars at the very
high end. The average click is probably worth about $0.20. Combine this statistic with
the fact that the CTR (the clicks an ad gets divided by the number of times it is served)
are in the low single-digit percentages—2 percent is a quite respectable CTR—and you
come up with the fact that to make good money from CPC, you need a lot of traffic. A
six-figure income from CPC contextual advertising is not unheard of, but it takes
monthly page views in the millions. Doing the math, this page-view volume implies
either a broad site or some highly trafficked pages (or both).
Supposing you have a great deal of content—say 10,000 pages—it’s possible to reach
the target volume of more than 100,000 page views per month with an average of 10
page views per page per month—ambitious, in terms of the amount of content, but not
impossible, and quite modest in terms of the traffic per page.
These 100,000 page views per month might theoretically give you an income of around
$400 per month calculated by multiplying 100,000 times the 2 percent CTR, times the
$0.20 average fee per click.
Of course, most sites are created to fulfill multiple needs and use a variety of mecha-
nisms to generate income. But if your only consideration is creating revenue using a
contextual CPC model, you should consider whether it makes more sense to get to
100,000 page views and beyond by creating relatively fewer heavily visited pages—the
shallow-site approach—or a great many less trafficked pages—the broad-site ap-
proach. Putting the same question in a slightly different way: is it better to draw niche
traffic, which may be worth more because it is highly targeted, or general traffic, which
is likely to be less categorizable and therefore less valuable. The answer may, of course,
depend on the niche you target.
If you take the broad-site approach, then you’ll need to figure out a low-cost way to
generate the content. The calculation that shows a $400 monthly revenue for a 10,000-
page site—a broad site that is not heavily trafficked—implies a revenue stream of about
$0.50 per page per year. For this to make sense as a business proposition, it can’t cost
you very much to generate this content (perhaps because you create it yourself and even
because—fates forfend!—some of the content generation is automated).
Business modeling is only as good as its assumptions. If the hypothetical 10,000-page
site averages 100 views per page rather than 10 views per page—not at all unreasonable
for a worthwhile site—then the economics shift radically in favor of the site publisher.
The site is now probably generating $50,000 or so annually in CPC contextual revenue
(each page contributes an average of $5).
The point here is to understand the implications of site and advertising metrics on the
economics of your site so you can take the steps required to meet your financial goals.
Site metrics, CPC advertising, and profitability in the context of Google’s AdSense
program are discussed further in Chapter 9.

CPC Vendors Compared
Google’s AdSense program is, of course, the largest of the contextual CPC ad programs,
with features aimed at both large and small web publishers.
See Part II for a lot more information about AdSense. In this chapter,
these programs are considered from the viewpoint of a web publisher
wanting to host ads. They could, of course, also be considered from the
opposite viewpoint: that is to say, an advertiser wishing to place an ad.
If you are a large web publisher, you may wish to investigate the major competitors to
Google’s AdSense: DoubleClick and Yahoo! Publisher Network. At the time of this
writing, DoubleClick is only open to publishers with hundreds of thousands of im-
pressions per day, and the Yahoo! program is in invitational beta (and also for larger
publishers).
While Google’s AdSense program works astonishingly well for many smaller publish-
ers, there are some reasons publishers might like to investigate working with one of
AdSense’s smaller competitors:
• You’d like more control over the ads that appear on your site, perhaps even to the
extent of approving each ad before it can be served on your web pages.
• Your site features content that is not acceptable to Google, such as adult content.
• You’d like to understand exactly what advertisers are paying for the ads and exactly
how much commission is being deducted; maybe you’d like to approve some ads
only if the price is right.
• You want to make sure you have a viable alternative to Google in case something
goes wrong with your Google account.
Some smaller CPC ad program vendors are shown in Table 6-1.

Placing Ad Units on Your Site
Publishers need to take the following fairly simple steps to place ad units on your site:
• Sign up with a program.
• Select the ad format that works best with your site.
• Add the code generated by the program to your pages.
Bear in mind the suggestion in Chapter 1 that ad unit code be placed
within an include architecture, allowing the flexibility to change ads
across multiple pages, portions of sites, or entire sites. In addition,
placing the ad code within an include means that you can easily switch
who you work with.
Signing Up
Figure 6-4 shows the AdBrite signup form, which is pretty typical of most programs.
You’ll also need to provide who you want checks made out to and a tax identification
number (either a Social Security number or an employer identification number).
Many programs also require that you complete and submit a W-9 tax
form.
166 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

Figure 6-4. Simple contact information plus a tax ID number is all you need to enroll in a CPC program
In addition, some of the programs (such as Google) will want at least one website URL.
They will manually vet the site for compliance with program content policies before
accepting you into the program.
Choosing the Kinds of Ads
Once you’ve been accepted, you can choose the kinds of ads you want to serve. On
AdBrite, as shown in Figure 6-5, the choices are banner and text versus text only, full-
page in-between ads, and inline ads.
Placing Ad Units on Your Site | 167

Figure 6-5. In the AdBrite program, you choose the format of the ads you want to serve
Selecting Ad Formats
Once you’ve chosen the kinds of ads you want to serve, you can choose ad formats—
meaning the size of the ad unit and number of ads—and colors for your site.
Some programs allow you to control adult content by specifying at the
beginning whether it is unacceptable (and even what level of explicitness
is permissible on your site). This is not an issue with Google’s AdSense,
since the AdSense program does not display adult ads at all or accept
adult content sites into the program. In addition, some programs allow
you to designate initial content areas, which are used until the contex-
tual engine completes its job.
168 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

Most programs provide a number of ad unit sizes to choose from, and also some pre-
selected color schemes. Figure 6-6 shows the AdBrite program ad generator.
Figure 6-6. Most ad generators, like the ones provided by AdBrite, allow you to select the number of
ads in your unit and how they are formatted
The design choices you make in relationship to ad format and color are
quite important. See Chapter 1 for some discussion of ad placement. In
addition, you should consider two possible, but incompatible, strat-
egies: making ads seem like they are part of a site’s content and making
ads different so they really stick out.
You’ll also need to set some ad content options, as well as to specify the default ad that
appears when there are no paid ads to display (see Figure 6-7).
With the ad content set, you can refine the appearance of your ad unit (Figure 6-8).
Placing Ad Units on Your Site | 169

Figure 6-7. You can set the default text that appears when there are no ads to be served on your site
AdBrite is a real two-way marketplace in the sense that advertisers can
decide to individually pick sites for placement, and publishers (if the
auto-approve checkbox shown in Figure 6-7 is not selected) can decide
whether they want to run individual ads on their site.
Figure 6-8. Once you pick your ad unit dimensions, you can refine its appearance to match your site
170 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

You should name your ad zone to describe the position of the ad unit
to potential advertisers, assuming you are going to implement multiple
ad units on your site.
The next step is to describe your site using a description and keywords (Figure 6-9).
This is for two reasons: to help AdBrite make a better contextual match, and also to
serve as an advertisement of your own to potential advertisers. The keywords and de-
scription you include do appear to any advertiser seeking a good host for their ads.
Figure 6-9. The description you add about your site is often used by advertisers to determine if there
is a good fit
Placing Ad Units on Your Site | 171

You can use the elevator pitch and keywords that you derived from the
material explain in Chapter 2 (and may have used as meta information
as explained in Chapter 3) for this form.
Next, choose a category for your site from the list, shown in Figure 6-10. Once again,
this selection is multipurpose—you are helping AdBrite contextualize your site and
also helping potential advertisers find you.
Figure 6-10. It’s important to correctly categorize your offering in AdBrite so that advertisers can
easily find you
Optionally, AdBrite will integrate your existing ad code, such as that from AdSense,
into their own unit, asserting that they will serve the highest paying ad from both
networks.
To take advantage of this, choose Yes to Reserve Pricing in the pricing options interface
shown in Figure 6-11. You’ll need to make sure the ad unit that you are integrating
with AdBrite’s has the same dimensions, and you’ll have to paste the code from the
other ad server into the HTML box shown in Figure 6-11.
If you’d rather not integrate ad units, and want to place the AdBrite unit in addition to
another unit, choose No to Reserve Pricing. In either case, you can proceed to pick up
the code you’ll need to add to your site.

to flexibly set pricing
Adding Code to Your Pages
Once you’ve selected your ad format, colors, and entered other options, AdBrite will
generate the code for your unit, as you can see in Figure 6-12.
Simply copy the code provided into your web pages where you’d like the ad units to
appear.
It’s important to place ad code in include files, as I explained in Chap-
ter 1, so that your ad settings can easily be modified site-wide.
Ad unit code consists of settings, which depend on your choice of format and color,
and a JavaScript call to the program on the ad server that actually displays the ad on
your site (see “Serving Ads” on page 161 for an explanation of this mechanism).
Placing Ad Units on Your Site | 173

Figure 6-12. AdBrite generates the code for its ad units that you use on your site
For example, an AdBrite ad unit might look like this in code:
<!-- Begin: AdBrite, Generated: 2008-12-19 13:56:19  -->
<script type="text/javascript">
var AdBrite_Title_Color = 'CC0000';

var AdBrite_Background_Color = 'CCCCCC';
var AdBrite_Border_Color = 'CCCCCC';

<!-- End: AdBrite -->
174 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

You can tweak the settings in the ad code easily enough to change the format or the
colors of the ads displayed. For example, in the code sample just shown, changing the
value of the variable AdBrite_Text_Color will change the color of the text displayed in
the AdBrite unit.
Technically, tweaking this code directly is prohibited by some TOS, although AdBrite
doesn’t seem to care as long as you don’t break anything. The bottom line is that no
one will mind if you are just adjusting things to fit in with your site’s look and feel.
Once your ad code has been copied to your site, you’ll get a temporary ad like the one
shown in Figure 6-13 until AdBrite has learned about your site.
Figure 6-13. Until AdBrite can gather information about your site, it displays this message
Placing Ad Units on Your Site | 175

Once AdBrite has fully gathered data and has some contextual ads to serve, the ads will
appear in your AdBrite unit on your site, depending on your choice of format, for
example, as shown in Figure 6-14.
Figure 6-14. An ad in the AdBrite unit appears above the Google ad unit
Display and Banner Ads
There’s nothing to stop display and banner ads from being contextually related to the
text they accompany, and obviously it is often a good idea. However, text ads—which
usually come in groups and have, by definition, text—present a greater opportunity
for effective contextual relevance. That’s why text ads are predominantly purchased
and displayed on a CPC basis (although, of course, they could be CPM), and why many
display and banner ads operate under CPM terms. The primary concern of CPM banner
and display ads is that they be viewed; while a call to action may be involves, it’s possible
that they may not be concerned in the way most CPC ads are with immediate results
(by clicking the text link provided).
With CPM (cost per thousand impressions) advertising, you get paid a
fee, based on thousands of impressions, when an ad is displayed on your
site. This is the kind of web advertising that is the most like traditional
media advertising: an advertiser pays for displaying its ad in a magazine,
on television, or on a website—end of story.
These considerations mean that the vast bulk of display and banner ads that you see
on the Web have been placed on a CPM basis.
176 | Chapter 6: Making Money by Hosting Advertising

One of the pitfalls of accepting CPM advertising is getting stuck with
garish imagery or Flash-based animations, as well as assorted pop ups
and pop unders, which can irritate and distract visitors to your website.
My own taste runs to less-is-more when it comes to advertising, but
you’ll need to experiment to see what works for your site.
CPM advertising cannot be expected to generate a very high CTR and does not pay
very much per impression. Typical CPM ad rates are in the $4 to $6 range per thousand
impressions, although significantly higher fees can be achieved in special situations (for
example, when a CPM sponsor underwrites an entire site).
Obviously, with these economics, making money from CPM is a volume affair. For the
most part, to even participate in CPM programs you need a minimum of 500,000
monthly page views. If you do have this kind of volume, you can find a great deal of
information about CPM advertising from the trade association that works with the
Internet CPM industry, the Internet Advertising Bureau.
Many of the advertising vendors shown earlier in Table 6-1 offer hosted display adver-
tising. If you are interested in this option, and have a fairly high trafficked site, you
should investigate ValueClick. Lower volume sites should check out AdBrite, which
has no minimum volume requirements and lets you set your own pricing structure.
For information about hosting CPM ads targeted to your site using Google’s AdSense
program, see Chapter 8.
Action Items
Here are some action items you may wish to consider to make (more) money from CPC
ads:
• Understand the logic behind CPC and contextual ad programs
• Get to know the terminology of the web advertising business
• Create a realistic plan based on the revenue you can expect from CPC advertising
• Understand both the power and pitfalls of contextual relevance
• Consider the architecture of web serving of ad units
• Make a comparison of CPC ad unit vendors
• Enroll your site in a CPC ad program
• Grab the code to use for your ad units
• Use server-side includes so that the CPC ad code is replicated across your site
• Choose ad formats and colors to match or complement your site design
• If your site has enough volume to make it feasible, investigate CPM advertising
programs

CHAPTER 7
Understanding the Google Behemoth
Google is a colossus that sits astride access to information on the World Wide Web.
Ubiquitous, useful, and often imitated—but seldom equaled—Google has lent its name
to a verb: to google something (or someone) is to search for the thing or person on the
Web. Google is also a forward-looking corporation filled with brilliant thinkers and
one of the largest companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. From its
roots as a search engine company, Google has emerged as a leader in many spheres,
from applications that are used to watch videos on the Web to on-demand office pro-
ductivity software.
The primary focus of this book is making money with the Google advertising applica-
tions: the AdSense and AdWords programs. These programs are closely related to
Google’s searching technology. An AdSense ad is placed on your website depending
on the context of your site (in other words, Google’s analysis of how your site is likely
to be found in response to a variety of searches). And the very same AdWords ad is
targeted using keywords and phrases—the same keywords and phrases used when
searching for something with Google.
The close relationship between Google web searching technology and the advertising
programs means that it is important to understand a little about the syntax of Google
searches when working with the AdSense program or crafting AdWords campaigns.
It’s not that I propose to teach you how to use Google to search in this book. Rather,
you need a sense of how others may be using Google to search when they come across
your sites or ads.
To get the most out of working with Google, you also need to understand the parts of
Google. It’s not easy to get a grasp of what Google is and what Google does in addition
to web search. For one thing, the parts of Google don’t all work together seamlessly.
This chapter starts with an overview explaining the parts of Google and what they do
so that you’ll get a sense of what Google resources may be available to you and how all
these moving parts integrate (or, as the case may be, don’t integrate).
179

After explaining Google’s search syntax and exploring what Google has to offer gen-
erally, this chapter drills down on Google’s role as an automated advertising broker
with these programs and explains, in general terms, how these programs are related
and how you work with them.
The Parts of Google
Google’s parts can, roughly speaking, be divided into the following categories:
Services
These let people do something (for example, search the Web or create a blog)
Tools
Software to make chores easier (for example, the Google Toolbar or the Picasa
image manipulation software)
Developer tools
Programs aimed at software developers, such as the AdWords API
Advertising solutions
Programs such as AdSense and AdWords
Business solutions
Products intended to be used as part of an enterprise infrastructure, such as the
Google Enterprise search appliance
Obviously, many of these aspects of Google are beyond the scope of this book, which
focuses on making money with Google advertising and the AdSense and AdWords
programs.
Google itself takes a more pragmatic tack in categorizing its applications that are avail-
able to consumers. On the More Google Products page, partly shown in Figure 7-1,
you’ll find the following categories:
• Search
• Explore and innovate
• Communicate, show & share
• Go mobile
• Make your computer work better
Some of the parts of Google can be opened directly from the Google home page. If you
don’t see the link you are interested in on the Google home page, open the More Google
Products page by starting at Google’s home page. Click the More link found on the
upper left of the page, then choose “even more” from the drop-down list.
180 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

You can reach the More Google Products page directly by opening http:
//www.google.com/options/ in your browser.
Figure 7-1. Google’s consumer applications are categorized on the More Google Products page
However you categorize this vast collection of applications and tools, you should at
least be aware of the scope of what is available. This section explains the parts of Google
you should know about, with a focus on the parts that are relevant to advertising.
Don’t be fazed because Google marks an application as still in beta.
Google tends to call applications beta (supposedly meaning still in test-
ing and not ready for release) long after most companies would declare
the software complete.
In addition to the software shown on the More Google Products page, Google has
numerous applications that have not yet made it to product status. You can test drive
much of this software from the Google Labs page, partially shown in Figure 7-2.
The Parts of Google | 181

Figure 7-2. The Google Labs page allows you to try Google software that hasn’t yet made it to product
status
Even More Google Parts
Parts of Google not discussed in this section (because there’s no clear and obvious
connection to advertising at the present time) include:
• Alerts (automatic notifications of news and search results by email)
• Blog Search (searches through current blogs by topic)
• Calendar (organizes your schedule and shares events with others)
• Checkout (an online payment mechanism that competes with PayPal)
• Google Chrome (a streamlined web browser)
• Desktop (searches the files on your desktop computer using an interface that looks
like Google’s web search)
• Docs (online word processing, presentations, and spreadsheets)
• Earth (explore the earth and sky using maps, satellite photos, and more)
• Finance (customizable business news)
• Groups (bulletin board posts on every conceivable subject)
• Images (comprehensive image search on the Web)
• News (lets you search news items)
• Picasa (image management and lightweight image editing)
• Translate (automatic translation of text and web pages)
These Google parts may not be the primary focus of this book, but even a quick glance
should give you respect for the breadth and depth of Google’s offerings.
Also, Google has a near-miraculous ability to build genuinely useful applications and
subsequently add advertising, in ways that actually add to the utility of the application.
In the future, these applications may be used to host or locate advertising.
182 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

Google is a moving target; it’s constantly innovating, releasing software, and acquiring
software companies. No static list of Google parts is ever likely to be up-to-date or final.
You’ll find links to almost all the parts of Google on the More Google Products page;
I’ll also provide a direct address to each Google part I discuss in the following
sections.
Blogger
Blogger is one of the largest hosted blogging services on the Web. Blogger hosts hun-
dreds of thousands of blogs, and it is free and easy to use. From an advertiser’s view-
point, Blogger and other hosted blogging services are interesting because they provide
Google with a venue for AdWords contextual ads, categorized by the specific interest
of the blog author. Some of the proceeds from these blogs go to the content creator,
although you’ll probably make more money by hosting your own content and displayed
AdSense units.
Book Search
Google Books lets users search through books submitted to the program by publishers
and other copyright holders. Google scans the books and hosts the resulting pages on
Google servers. These pages are then used by Google to display contextual ads. Google
pays a portion of the revenue from the ads to the owner of the materials. Google Book
Search represents an interesting venue for advertisements, as well as a possible profit
center for authors and publishers.
At the time of this writing, Google has reached an extensive and general licensing
agreement with publishers and authors. Assuming this agreement becomes effective,
the content available under this program (and potential sites to host advertising) will
greatly expand.
Directory
Google Directory uses the categorization scheme and sites selected by the Open
Directory Project (ODP) to find information that has been vetted by volunteer editors
familiar with a particular subject. As I explained in Chapter 2, the ODP is important
to you if you want to drive traffic to your site. You can use Google Directory to explore
Google’s use of the ODP taxonomy.
Gmail
Gmail is one of the best free email services on the Web, with good anti-spam technol-
ogy, plentiful storage, and excellent searching capabilities. Gmail is used to host text
and link ads that are relevant to a recipient’s email.
The Parts of Google | 183

GOOG-411
GOOG-411, 1-800-GOOG-411, is a directory assistance program that will partially be
supported by audio advertisements relevant to searches requested.
Google Health
Google Health is intended to help people organize their health records in one place
online. This is an ambitious and laudable goal not intimately related to advertising, but
note that the portions of the application that are used to search for health care providers
do host contextual advertisements.
Maps
Google Maps is a service that provides maps and directions. When you search within
Google Maps for an address, business, or landmark, the results page shows businesses
that seem related to your search (for example, Japanese restaurants as in Figure 7-3),
and also businesses located close to your search address.
Figure 7-3. Google Maps results are used to host geographically relevant ads
In Figure 7-3, the top “sponsored” link is a paid AdWords placement
while the other listings come from natural search results. See Chap-
ter 2 for more about the distinction.
For advertisers who draw business based on location—such as restaurants—the ability
to place proximity-based ads on Google Maps may prove to be extremely significant.
184 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

Product Search
Google Product Search lets you search through many of the products available on the
Web. Sellers can add products to Product Search using a data feed; there’s no cost for
inclusion. Google does use search results pages to host advertisements.
Scholar
Google Scholar lets you search for academic, peer-reviewed articles and citations. Al-
though Scholar has had some rather mixed reviews, it is certainly one of the largest free
repositories online of scholarly material, and Google Scholar search results are another
place Google displays contextual advertising.
YouTube
YouTube, shown in Figure 7-4, is the leading application for watching, uploading, and
sharing videos.
Figure 7-4. YouTube is probably the most popular site for watching videos on the Web
There are several advertising programs on YouTube that are either operational or in
the works. Google enrolls partners that draw substantial traffic on YouTube in a pro-
The Parts of Google | 185

gram that derives revenue from contextual ads. The ads display on the pages that host
the content. Other ads display for certain content as video overlays.
These kinds of ad programs are interesting to content owners. For example, a website
might promote videos on YouTube that generate revenue. For details, see Chapter 8.
Obviously, YouTube is also interesting to advertisers. Check out http://www.youtube
.com/t/advertising for more information.
Content Versus Search
Google contextual ads appear on web content as in Figure 7-5 when the owner of the
web content site signs up with the AdSense program.
Figure 7-5. Content ads appear on websites that have enrolled in the AdSense program
186 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

See Chapter 6 for a discussion of how well (or poorly) contextual rele-
vance software actually works.
These ads also appear on search results pages, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-6. Entries marked as sponsored (right) are paid ads, while the longer entries on the left are
natural search results
Within the Google AdSense program, ads of the first kind are called content ads, and
those of the second kind are search ads.
If a user goes to the Google home page and searches, only Google profits from the ads
placed on the search results page. If, however, the search originates from an AdSense
search unit, like the one shown in Figure 7-7, the owner of the site hosting the search
box shares in any proceeds from the search.
See Chapter 8 for information about adding a search box to your site, and Chap-
ter 10 for a comparison of content and search ads from the viewpoint of an advertiser.
Anatomy of a Search Query
The primary Google search interface, the Google home page, is famously simple and
uncluttered (as shown in Figure 7-8).
You enter a word or words, also called keywords, search terms, or queries, in the Google
search form.
As you probably know, when you click the I’m Feeling Lucky button, Google opens
the page that is the top-ranked search result for your query.
Anatomy of a Search Query | 187

Figure 7-8. In its simplest form, Google search returns results for keywords entered in the search box
Experienced researchers don’t usually bother with the I’m Feeling Lucky
button because it is unlikely you will find what you need this way and
it wastes time—even if it is fun!
Clicking the Google Search button opens the first page of Google’s search results for
your query. Google’s search results pages also display AdWords ads that are contex-
tually relevant to the query that generated the pages.
Figure 7-7. When a search box is placed on a content site, ads on the search results page are profitable
to the site owner
188 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

Google Syntax and Operators
Google searches support a number of operators, including:
AND
The AND operator tells Google to explicitly join two keywords in a query. It must
be uppercase (cannot be written and).
OR
The OR operator, which can also be written using the pipe character (|), matches
any of the terms joined with this operator in a query. It must be uppercase (cannot
be written or).
+
The “plus” operator, called the inclusion operator, forces Google to include words,
such as stop words (defined shortly), in a search.
-
The “minus” operator, called the exclusion operator, looks for results that do not
have the specified keyword in them. For example, a search for virus -computer
finds results that have to do with viruses, but not computers (particularly useful if
you are looking for biologic viruses).
To avoid confusion, all search terms are printed in this book in literal
font (as in Google AdWords). If quotes are shown in the search term—as
in "Computer Programming"—then those quotes are part of the search
term and would be typed in by the user.
You should also know that Google searches omit many common words, called stop
words. Stop words that are omitted include “and,” “for,” “the,” and most punctuation.
If you want to include a stop word in your search, you need to include it within double
quotes.
Double quoting also serves the purpose of searching for an entire quoted string. For
example, to search for the film Star Wars: Episode III, you could use the query
"Star Wars III". Without the quotes, the III would be omitted as a stop word.
The Rules of Simple Search
Searching with Google can be really simple, but it helps to keep some basic rules of
Google search syntax in mind:
Implicit AND connection
Google assumes that two or more words in a query are connected by an AND oper-
ator, even when the AND is omitted. A search for Landscape Photography is the same
as a search for Landscape AND Photography.
Anatomy of a Search Query | 189

All-word search
Google searches for all words in a query, unless they are stop words.
Results can be anywhere
A successful search finds results anywhere in a document (such as in HTML and
meta information), not just in its text.
Word order matters
The words in a search are ordered in terms of importance from left to right.
Proximity counts
Words in a query that are close together in a search result are returned ahead of
results where the words are farther apart.
Google is not case-sensitive
Google does not care about capitalization. A search for new york returns results
that include New York, and a search for New York returns new york with lowercase
initial letters.
Effective Searching
Google searches tend to be more effective—producing better search results—if the
following concepts are kept in mind:
Google looks for words, not meaning
Google’s algorithms look for the occurrences of words and phrases, not the mean-
ing of words. So it helps to think about how words are likely to be used in context
and in web pages when formulating a search.
Specificity and distinctiveness in keyword choice helps
If you search using generic words—words that are used in a great many documents
on the Web—you won’t get as useful a result set as you would if you pinpointed
more unusual words that are relevant to your search.
Use singular, plural, and alternate word forms
Since Google is looking for words, not meaning, you may need to use alternative
forms of words in your searches to get the widest results. A search for photograph,
photographs, and photography may each yield different results.
You can use the OR operator to search for several forms of the same word:
photograph | photographs | photography.
These concepts related to effective searching have big implications for participants in
the AdWords program (see Part III for more about AdWords). An important part of
AdWords is selecting the right keywords to target your ads against. It’s hard to
190 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

cost-effectively target generic words that generate massive search results; it makes much
more sense to target narrow, quirky words (and phrases).
Advanced Search
Google Advanced Search, shown in Figure 7-9, can be opened using the URL http://
www.google.com/advanced_search. Google Advanced Search implements the operators
explained earlier in “Google Syntax and Operators” on page 189 (and a number of
additional operators that space considerations precluded me from explaining) using a
visual interface, so you don’t need to enter the operators as part of a search query.
Figure 7-9. Google Advanced Search lets you implement sophisticated searching without
understanding Google’s query language
The Search Results Page
A typical Google search results page is shown in Figure 7-10. It’s a good idea to learn
a little more about what to expect on a results page and what ads to expect, because
Google search results pages are where more than half of all AdWords ads turn up.
Ads placed with the Google network using AdWords show up on web
content (via AdSense), in third-party pages with whom Google has con-
tracted, and on Google’s search results. The Google search results are
the most important of these from a dollars-and-cents viewpoint and also
have the best CTR.
Anatomy of a Search Query | 191

For a given keyword, relevant results are returned in the order of their PageRank—the
complex formula Google uses to determine the importance of a web page—in Google’s
index. Each search results page provides statistics in the upper-right corner (above the
actual search results) that show you an estimate of how many results were found and
how long a search took.
Figure 7-10. A Google search results page provides a great deal of information in each result block
as well as “sponsored links” (AdWords ads)
Each of the results on the page is represented by a snippet of text from the web page
the result points to, called a search results block. A link to the web page is part of the
search results block, with the title of the page as the text for the link if it is available
(the page’s URL is used if the title isn’t available).
Each results block also provides a Cached link (if this is available) and a Similar Pages
link. If you click the Cached link, a copy of the page saved by Google’s servers will
open. This is useful in case the page has changed since it was indexed by Google. It’s
also handy for finding where on a page the search terms are located: they are highlighted
in the cached version. The cache will also tell you if the query appears only in links
pointing to the page, and not on the page itself.
The Similar Pages link opens pages that Google determines bear a close relationship to
the page found in the search results.
192 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

Using the Google related operator in a search is equivalent to clicking
the Similar Pages link following a search result.
Following Similar Pages links for a search is a great technique for participants in Ad-
Words to ferret out keyword alternatives. The sites that are in part of the similar results
may be what the traffic you are interested in selling to is interested in visiting; you can
get ideas from these sites about what keywords to bid on.
Learning More About Google Search
This section provides enough about the mechanics of working with Google search so
that you can skillfully use the Google AdSense and AdWords programs. But, obviously,
it is not a complete guide to becoming an experienced researcher with Google.
For more information about researching with Google, begin with the Google Help
documentation. A good starting place on the Web is “The Essentials of Google Search”.
Google: The Missing Manual (O’Reilly) is a great introduction to Google search tools
and techniques. Google Hacks: Tips & Tools for Finding and Using the World’s Infor
mation, Third Edition (O’Reilly) provides more in-depth technical information. My
own Building Research Tools with Google for Dummies (Wiley) explains how to use
Google as a professional research tool, what information you can expect to find in
Google (and what isn’t there), and how to evaluate the credibility of information you
do find on the Web.
The Automated Ad Broker: AdWords
Google places ads on its own properties—most significantly on search results pages—
and on websites that have signed up for the AdSense program.
Google also places ads in third-party content networks to extend the
range of its ads even further.
Advertisers—businesses and people with something to sell or promote—sign up with
Google via the AdWords program. Working with AdWords, which involves bidding a
maximum amount for particular keywords, is explained in detail in Chapter 10.
The Automated Ad Broker: AdWords | 193

Google’s software sits like an automated advertising broker between the two halves of
this equation, as shown in Figure 7-11. It’s a really important point. If a content ad is
hosted by Google and appears on your site, the advertiser and the publisher could
theoretically cut out the company in the middle (Google), if each knew who the other
was and could negotiate a price both felt was fair. For example, if I publish a site with
information about digital photography, and I notice that online camera stores often
provide the Google AdSense ads that appear on my site, I could theoretically approach
one of these camera stores and negotiate a deal to carry ads for the store on my site that
did not pay Google a commission. However, that assumes that I know who to contact
and want to take on the added responsibility of a direct interface with the stores. Since
many people don’t want this extra responsibility, using Google as an intermediary turns
out to be a good solution.
Like all successful intermediaries, Google’s job is introducing parties and establishing
a market pricing mechanism that both sides feel is fair (or, at least, that they can live
with). What’s unusual about Google is the success, scale, and automation with which
it achieves this intermediation.
Figure 7-11. Google is the intermediary between AdSense accounts and AdWords advertisers
In the case of advertisements that are placed on websites participating in the AdSense
content network, the business model is really simple. Google takes in money from the
advertisers and pays out money to the owners of the web content. Your goal, if you are
a website content owner, should be to maximize your share of this revenue stream, and
Google’s game is to make the most of the difference between what it has to pay for ad
space (AdSense) and what it can take in placing ad inventory (AdWords).
194 | Chapter 7: Understanding the Google Behemoth

The Google inventory of pages that can host ads is bifurcated, however, and Google’s
model with its own search results pages is different and more complex. Google’s search
results pages make Google a content owner of an incredibly valuable web property—
one that is, however, difficult and expensive to maintain. Google’s profit in this portion
of its business comes from taking in more ad revenue than it pays out to maintain and
improve its search application (and, to some degree, the other parts of Google). The
goal of a participant in the AdWords program who is looking to place ads on the Google
search network is to maximize the effectiveness of its expenditures on the AdWords
program.
What About Click Fraud?
Click fraud means clicking on contextual ads with no interest in purchasing the goods
or services advertised, usually with the intention of defrauding the advertiser or en-
riching the contextual publisher. Most often, click fraud occurs as part of an effort to
raise expenses for a competitor—by making them pay for the bogus clicks—or as an
attempt at self-enrichment by a publisher (by clicking on ads on its own pages).
Click fraud is a serious problem, at least in terms of perceptions, on the Internet for
contextual advertising vendors.
Google has major efforts underway to detect click fraud, which are in the aggregate
fairly successful, but the details of these programs are (for obvious reasons) secret. The
bottom line:
• On a very small scale, it is possible to commit click fraud and get away with it.
However, as a publisher, you should take care to be totally aboveboard. If Google
suspects you of click fraud, it will most likely close your account and possibly ban
your sites from the Google search index.
• Detecting click fraud is a statistical matter. Once the fraud becomes statistically
significant, it will probably be detected.
Contextual advertising does work and delivers targeted prospects much more effec-
tively than any other method. A small amount of click fraud is a fact of life—most
advertisers regard it as a cost of doing business that does not diminish the relative
effectiveness of CPC advertising.
Action Items
To become an effective and productive user of the Google AdSense and AdWords pro-
grams, you should:
• Get a sense of Google’s gigantic extent
• Spend some time getting a grasp on what the main parts of Google contain and
how they relate to your advertising agenda
Action Items | 195

• Understand the difference between content and search advertising
• Learn the basics of Google’s search syntax
• Think about the queries users are likely to use to find your products or services (or
products and services similar to yours)
• Understand Google’s brokering function between the AdSense and AdWords
programs
• Try to see the world from both viewpoints: AdSense publishers will make more if
they understand how AdWords works, and AdWords advertisers will be more
effective if they consider the position of content owners who are signed up with
AdSense

PART II
Cashing in with AdSense


CHAPTER 8
Working with AdSense
Once you know how to work with AdSense, you can start making money from your
websites by placing Google’s ad code in your web pages and displaying ads. This chap-
ter explains the details of how to work with the Google AdSense program, from signup
through obtaining your AdSense code and pasting it into your web pages. I’ll explain
what the different options are and how you can tweak your AdSense settings to be most
successful.
From Google’s viewpoint, the AdSense program represents a way to extend the pages
that host its ads from its own search results pages across the entire Web. The result of
this extension has been the creation of an excellent mechanism for monetizing content
and traffic.
Google makes its living from advertising, and the Google AdSense program in particular
earns its keep by placing ads in web content. It’s therefore not surprising to see AdSense
promoting itself as the way to reap “the reward of great content.” However, reaping
the reward requires not only content (as explained in Chapter 1) and traffic (as covered
in Chapter 3) but also understanding how to adjust the “dials” on AdSense itself. The
job of this chapter is to make sure you become an effective and efficient user of AdSense.
It’s worth having a quick look at the web content scenarios that Google
presents as AdSense successes for both new and current AdSense
publishers. You can view these case studies at https://www.google.com/
adsense/success.
Applying for an AdSense Account
To apply for a Google AdSense account, visit the Google AdSense home page, shown
in Figure 8-1.

Figure 8-2. You apply to open an account with the Google AdSense program using this simple form
200 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

There are a few issues you’ll need to bear in mind as you complete this form:
Website address
You need to provide Google with the URL for your primary website (see the up-
coming sidebar “Providing a Website Address”).
Agreements
You need to agree not to place AdSense ads on sites that incentivize visitors to click
on the ads or that include pornographic content.
Besides pornography, AdSense policies prohibit a fairly wide vari-
ety of content including content that is drug- or violence-related,
content that explains hacking, and gambling sites. You can see the
full list of prohibitions on the AdSense Program Policies page.
If the content on your site is prohibited, you should avoid AdSense
and consider the alternative CPC programs described in Chapter 6.
Account type
You can have an individual or business account. For business accounts, you’ll need
to have a checking account in the business name.
Contact information
You need to tell Google what name to put on the checks and where to mail those
checks, and provide phone and email contact information.
Policies
You need to agree not to click on the ads you are hosting and certify that you have
read the AdSense policies (also referred to as the Terms of Service, or TOS). You
can open the AdSense Program Policies page using a link on the signup page or at
https://www.google.com/adsense/policies. You also need to check a box stating that
you don’t already have an AdSense account.
Providing a Website Address
Google will review the website address you provide for compliance with the content
policies of the AdSense program. It is common for Google to reject websites for non-
compliance with content provisions of the AdSense policies; as I’ve already noted, the
prohibitions are fairly broad and exclude a variety of “sinful” content, ranging from
excessive advertising content or adult content to content about hacking—and even
prohibit content using excessive profanity. If you plan to host AdSense, your site had
better not promote sin or even cuss words.
It is permissible (and often makes sense logistically) to use one Google AdSense account
across multiple web addresses. If you are maintaining half a dozen sites, it is easier to
work with a single AdSense account than to keep up with statistics on multiple ac-
counts. If you are using one AdSense account across multiple sites, you’ll probably
want to take advantage of AdSense channels, explained later in this chapter. There’s
Applying for an AdSense Account | 201

also information in Chapter 9 about what you need to do to monitor your AdSense
performance.
If you are a devious thinker with some “sinful” content and other clean sites, you might
consider the scenario of submitting one URL for acceptance into the program and
eventually placing AdSense ads on noncompliant sites. You could probably get away
with doing this for a while, but it is a bad idea. If you are caught, Google will most likely
terminate your entire account.
The best approach is to apply for a separate account for any website with questionable
content. That way, you are aboveboard. If Google accepts the account application, it
can have no beef with you because of the content. If Google rejects the application,
you’ll need to work with one of the less squeamish vendors mentioned in Chapter 6.
It’s pretty simple, really, to fill out the AdSense form; as these things go, it is not a lot
of red tape. Once you’ve entered the information required to sign up with AdSense,
you must associate it with a Google account. There are two ways to do this:
• You can associate your AdSense application with an existing Google account, such
as one you use with Gmail or AdWords.
• You can create a new Google account, as shown in Figure 8-3, for use with the
AdSense program.
Figure 8-3. If you don’t already have a Google account, you’ll need to create one
202 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

The next step is to wait for Google to review your application, which usually takes one
or two days. You’ll be notified of program acceptance in an email sent to the address
you provided.
Setting Account Options
Once you’ve been accepted into the AdSense program, proceed to the Google AdSense
home page shown earlier. Log in using your Google account information as shown in
Figure 8-4.
Figure 8-4. Use your Google account information to sign into AdSense
Once you’ve logged in, your first step should be to verify your initial settings and enter
some more information. Start by clicking the My Account tab. The My Account tab
has four main pages:
• Account Settings
• Account Access
• Payment History
• Tax Information
You’ll find that you can modify your initial account options using the Account Settings
page, as well as set some significant options, namely your payment preferences (and
what could be more important?) and your global ad display preferences.
Payment Preferences
To change your payment preferences, on the Account Settings page click the edit link
that follows Payment Details, as shown in Figure 8-5.
Setting Account Options | 203

Figure 8-5. Click the edit link in the Payment Details section to change how you are paid
The Choose Form of Payment window, shown in Figure 8-6, will open. The choices are:
• Electronic Funds Transfer to your bank account
• Check by regular mail (free but it takes longer)
• Express delivery of your check (there’s a $30.00 processing fee)
Figure 8-6. You can choose to have your payments transferred electronically or sent by check
Arranging to have your AdSense payments electronically transferred to your bank ac-
count is an attractive option because there are no delays and there is less chance of a
paper check getting misplaced in the mail.
In order to have funds transferred by Google, you need a verified bank account. In the
bank account verification process, first you enter your bank account number and bank
routing number. Next, Google deposits small sums of money (less than a dollar) in
your bank account. Once you see these deposits in your account, you must go online
and enter the amounts. Once Google sees that you have access to your account records,
your account is considered verified.
Not all payment options are available in all countries; the options avail-
able to you will depend upon the physical address associated with your
account.
204 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

You can also elect to have your payments held (and accrued) indefinitely rather than
paid monthly by clicking the edit link in the Payment Holding section on the Account
Settings page, shown in Figure 8-7.
Figure 8-7. You can choose to let your earnings accrue rather than have them paid monthly
Ad Display Preference
Ad Display Preference, on the Account Settings page, sounds like a big deal, but it’s
really used to set the default for one thing.
This preference is used to set global preferences for whether you want to display text
ads only or both text and images. This Ad Type Preference option sets your global
default; you can override your default global choice on a page-by-page basis when you
specify options for a block of Google ad code that will be placed on a particular page.
Text ads are the delivery format of most of Google’s contextual adver-
tising. Some content owners may want to avoid image ads because they
can clutter sites and may work to the detriment of content.
Account Access
The Account Access page shows you the email address of users with access to your
AdSense account. Generally, this will be the email address associated with the Google
account that you used to open your AdSense account.
Multiple users can be associated with a single AdSense account if you
use Google Ad Manager, explained later in this chapter, or Google An-
alytics, covered in Chapter 13.
In addition, you may need to set software access to your AdSense account on the Ac-
count Access page. For example, Blogger, FeedBurner, and YouTube all need to be
authorized for account access on this page so they can serve ads with your AdSense
codes (assuming you are signed up with these other programs, and have integrated your
content offerings on those sites with your AdSense account).
Setting Account Options | 205

Reviewing Payment History
The Payment History link on the Account Settings page opens a display of your earnings
and payment history as shown in Figure 8-8. Using the Payment History window, you
can determine the amount of recent payments and get a ballpark sense of when and
how much your next payment is likely to be.
Although it’s reasonable to want to know how much money one is owed, the infor-
mation in this display is quite sketchy and not very useful for tracking your account
activity. See Chapter 9 for information about better ways to monitor the activity in your
AdSense account.
Figure 8-8. You can view your earnings and payment information on a per-month basis or download
the data so it can be opened in a spreadsheet
Filing Tax Information
Filing appropriate tax information forms with Google is really part of the account ap-
plication process, and your account won’t be activated until you file these forms. If you
are a United States resident, you will need to file an IRS form W-9 with Google; residents
of other countries will need to comply with the legal requirements of the tax authority
in their domicile.
If you are operating under your name—or, to put this formally, as a sole
proprietorship using your own Social Security number (SSN)—you will
need to file an IRS form W-9 with Google that lists your SSN. Depending
on your situation, the income that Google reports to the IRS for your
SSN will likely be reported on a Schedule C with your next income tax
filing.
206 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

For instructions and forms, with the Account Settings page open, click the Tax Infor-
mation link. Most likely, you will be able to file the appropriate forms online. Once
your form has been filed with Google, when you click the Tax Information link you’ll
see a message stating, “Our records indicate that you have already submitted the
appropriate information.”
You can change your tax information as necessary—for example, be-
cause you now have a business tax ID—using the Filing Tax Information
link.
AdSense Programs
Google AdSense provides a number of different programs for monetizing content, each
of which works in a somewhat different way, as I’ll discuss in detail later in this chapter.
You can deploy each of these different programs by clicking the AdSense Setup tab,
which opens the Get Ads page shown in Figure 8-9.
The programs are:
• AdSense for Content
• AdSense for Search
• AdSense for Feeds
• AdSense for Domains
• Video units
• “AdSense for Mobile Content” on page 217
AdSense for Content is by far the most important program, with AdSense for Search a
distant second. These two programs are similar in the sense that they are both utilized
by website owners with content and traffic. In contrast, each of the other programs
involves either specialized content (feeds, video, or mobile content) or a parked
domain—so each of the other programs can be thought of as noncore, although they
can present good opportunities for making money.
AdSense Programs | 207

Figure 8-9. The Get Ads page is your gateway to deployment of the various AdSense programs
While the AdSense for Content and AdSense for Search are generally aimed at the same
kind of web content, there are differences in the way the programs work. AdSense for
Content places ads on your web pages, similar to the ad unit shown in Figure 8-10, and
you make money when a site visitor clicks on the ad.
With AdSense for Search, you put a Google search box, like the one shown in Fig-
ure 8-11, on your site.
The AdSense search box displays Google search results when a user enters a query.
These search results show relevant ads. You receive a portion of the revenue generated
when a visitor uses your search box and then clicks on an ad from the search results
page, such as that shown in Figure 8-12, returned by Google.
208 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Figure 8-10. A typical AdSense for Content unit provides text ads with links; you get paid when
someone clicks one of the links
Adding to the power of the AdSense search program, you can use the
SiteSearch option to search your site rather than the Web (see “AdSense
for Search Settings” on page 230 for details). You can also configure
the AdSense search results page (whether searching your site or the
Web) to match the look of your website.
AdSense Programs | 209

the page shown), you earn revenue with AdSense for Search
210 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

AdSense for Content or AdSense for Search?
Is AdSense for Content or AdSense for Search right for your site? It’s hard to say, and
of course you can have both on your site.
From a general viewpoint, AdSense for Content works best on destination sites. If vis-
itors to your site tend to linger a while and regard your site as conferring some authority
on the ads you present, then AdSense for Content will probably work well.
On the other hand, if your site is a way station leading toward further information
(usually on other sites), then it is probable that visitors will frequently use AdSense for
Search, if it is available on your site, and this program may make you quite a bit of
money.
AdSense for Content Ad Settings
Once your AdSense account has been approved, you’ll likely want to get started by
adding the code that will place Google’s ads on your site. To get started with AdSense
for Content, log in to Google AdSense and click the Ad Settings tab. The AdSense for
Content Wizard, shown in Figure 8-13, will open.
Figure 8-13. The AdSense for Content Wizard walks you through the process of getting ad code
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 211

You can choose to enter all your settings at once by selecting the single
page option; it’s equivalent to the Wizard and may be quicker to use
once you are familiar with AdSense.
Ad Type
Ads are supplied by Google in units. An ad unit contains from one to six ads. For
example, an ad unit was shown earlier in Figure 8-10.
A link unit, shown in Figure 8-14, contains four or five links to pages listing ads.
Figure 8-14. A link unit displays links to Google pages that display ads
Your first choice is to decide which kind of unit—ad or link—you want to display.
Web pages can contain both kinds of AdSense ad units on the same
page. According to the Google TOS, you can have up to three ad units
on a single page, and you can mix and match ad and link units.
If you select an ad unit, the drop-down list to the right of the ad unit radio button
(shown earlier in Figure 8-13) is used to determine whether only text ads will be dis-
played in the unit, only image ads will be displayed in the unit, or both.
You can also just leave the text ad/image ad setting for the unit at the
default you selected when you signed up for the AdSense program or
that you chose in your account options.
Ad units display ads directly on your pages, where they are probably more likely to be
clicked than link units. Link units are, in some ways, one step removed; a link unit
presents links to ads rather than the ads themselves. But the advantage of the link unit
is that it takes up almost no space and the ad pages can contain many ads.
This effective use of real estate makes sense if your site visitors are affirmatively looking
for additional resources related to a topic rather than “impulse clicking.” Once again,
experimentation and trial and error are the best ways to find what works on your site.
212 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

After you’ve chosen the type of ad unit you are configuring, click Continue to open the
Ad Format and Colors panel of the Wizard.
Ad Format and Colors
If you are configuring an ad unit (as opposed to a link unit), you will see a page like
that shown in Figure 8-15.
Figure 8-15. You can use the Ad Format and Colors panel of the Wizard to configure what your ad
unit will look like
If you are configuring a link unit, this panel will look slightly different, as you can see
in Figure 8-16.
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 213

The Format section of the ad layout code page is used to specify a size for your ad or
link unit. Table 8-1 shows the drop-down list of choices for ad units, which are also

Colors
The Colors section, shown in Figure 8-18, lets you choose the colors for text and other
elements of your AdSense ad units so that your ad units work well with your site.
Figure 8-18. You can choose colors for your AdSense ad units that work well with your site
You can choose from a number of existing color schemes, called color palettes, for your
ad unit, or design your own color scheme. It’s likely that you will want to pick your
own colors, either to match your pages or to stand out from your pages. In that case,
you should save your scheme as a custom palette by clicking the “Save as new palette”
link shown in Figure 8-18.
The best way to see which (if any) of the existing color palettes is right for a given web
page or site, and to see the impact of your custom color choices, is to run through the
list of possibilities in the Palettes drop-down list. When you select a color palette, an
example showing the appearance of the ad elements using that scheme will display to
the left under the word “Sample.”
Which Color Choice Works Best?
There’s a lot of discussion in webmaster circles about which AdSense colors work best.
Ultimately, nobody really knows; it is different for different sites, and experimenting
and watching the results make sense. It’s now even easier to do this if you link your
Google AdSense account to your Google Analytics account.
That said, there are two circulating theories that have strong advocates (but happen to
be contradictory):
• Use the color palette to match your site. If you do this, it is speculated, some users
may click on the ads because they think they are part of your site, not ads.
• Make a color choice that starkly contrasts with your site. By doing this, the ads are
made more noticeable, and thus it is more likely that they may be clicked.
216 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

You can also get a sense of the visual impact of your color choices by
clicking “Preview this AdSense unit.”
More options
If you are configuring an ad unit, you can choose a corner type for the unit. The choices
are square corners, slightly rounded corners, or very rounded corners. If you don’t make
a choice, you will get square corners.
If Google doesn’t have an ad to display on your web page—because it hasn’t figured
out what would be contextually relevant or because there’s nothing in the Google ad
inventory that matches your content—Google will display a public service ad of its
choice. There’s nothing wrong, in my opinion, with public service ads, and personally
I always elect to display them. However, some webmasters do not like to give away
their “real estate” without getting something in return.
You can change the behavior of a Google ad unit when it doesn’t have an ad to serve
by choosing either an alternate URL or a color code (Figure 8-19). The obvious use for
an alternate URL is to use it to link to a standby ad of your own, so that the real estate
occupied on your site by the Google ad unit can be productive even when Google
doesn’t have any ads to serve.
The color code box is used to enter a color specification in hexadecimal RGB notation.
To get the hexadecimal for a color, you can click the “Choose a color” link. Select the
color you’d like from a palette and Google will supply the hexadecimal code. This color
will be displayed in the Google unit when there is no ad to serve.
Figure 8-19. If you choose an alternate URL or a color code, Google will not display public service ads
The best use for the color alternative is to specify the background color
of your site. That way, if Google doesn’t have an ad to serve, the Google
ad unit will not be visible—it will just look like part of your site
background.
AdSense for Mobile Content
AdSense for Mobile Content works pretty much like a regular AdSense unit—except
that you have to have a mobile website written using mobile markup tags. Mobile sites
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 217

need to be constructed using server-side scripting languages. Google only supports
ASP.NET, JSP, Perl, and PHP.
Google won’t help you build this kind of site; as the supporting documentation notes,
if you don’t know whether you have one, you probably don’t. A suggestion is to search
the web for terms like “create mobile website” or “make mobile web page.”
Actually, it is not difficult to convert many websites so that they are mobile (although
some kinds of content, such as large graphic files, are inherently resistant to mobile
display).
To get started once you have a mobile website, from the AdSense Setup page, click
AdSense for Mobile Content. Configuring a mobile content unit is essentially the same
as configuring a normal ad unit except there is less real estate (so you can only display
single or double ads), and you need to specify the mobile markup language used on
your site. The choices are XHTML (WAP 2.0, the default), WML (WAP 1.x), and
CHTML.
In certain circumstances, mobile advertising is very effective and useful. For example,
if I am looking for a Chinese restaurant in a specific area with my mobile device, then
I’ll be glad to see relevant ads. However, when planning mobile advertising you should
bear in mind the limited nature of display space, and try to ensure customer relevancy
—there’s nothing more annoying than an irrelevant ad when you just need to use your
phone.
Ad Channels
Channels are a mechanism for keeping track of which part of a site—or which site, if
you are managing multiple sites in one AdSense account—is generating clicks. Custom
channels are channels that you define in advance of ad deployment. A Google unit can
be assigned to a custom channel you’ve created, as shown in Figure 8-20.
In addition to custom channels, URL channels, which track ad unit clicks by URL, can
help you keep track of how your Google ad and link units are doing. See “Using Chan-
nels” on page 227 for more information about channels.
Getting the Code
With your Google unit selections made, it’s time to grab the code for your unit and
place it in your web page.
Ad unit example
Suppose you decided to create a Skyscraper (120 × 600) ad unit using a custom color
palette and very rounded corners (and otherwise accept the default options from
Google). The next step is to give the ad unit a name, as shown in Figure 8-21.
218 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Figure 8-21. By giving your AdSense unit a name, you’ll be able to find it to change its settings when
you need to
Be sure to pick a descriptive name. Assuming you have a number of web
pages, and a corresponding number of AdSense ad units, it can be
difficult to know which one is which unless you provide plenty of
information in the unit name.
Once you’ve named your ad unit, click “Submit and Get Code.” Next, click the code
box shown in Figure 8-22 to select and then copy the code for the unit you have
specified.
Figure 8-20. Custom channels are user-defined and can help you keep track of pages and groups of
pages and their click-through rates
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 219

Figure 8-22. The next step is to copy and paste the code from the box into your web page
Here’s the complete code for the ad unit:
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-5493015234961725";
/* 120x600,1/28/09, Homepage above the fold */
google_ad_slot = "1963938419";
google_ad_width = 120;
google_ad_height = 600;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
If you look at the code that makes up this Google ad unit, it is really a very simple affair,
built using JavaScript. First, a couple of variables are set, including your publisher ID
and an ID for the ad (the google_ad_slot value). Next, a remote script on Google’s
server, show_ads.js, is called. This script generates the HTML for the ad unit that dis-
plays on your page.
It’s your job to paste the code that Google has generated into position in the pages
served by your web server. The specifics of the tools you need to use to do this depend
upon many variables, but it’s no different than making any other changes to your web
pages.
220 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Figure 8-23 shows adding the Google code to a PHP web page using a PHP code editor.
Figure 8-23. You’ll need to add the Google code to your pages on your web server
You can check out the way this ad unit looks in Figures 8-10 and 8-24.
Once you’ve created it, you can change the configuration of an existing ad unit without
modifying the code using the Manage Ads page (see “Managing Ads” on page 224).
Earlier versions of AdSense ads set configuration options using variables
within the code. This meant that you had to change your pages to change
the appearance of the ads. These older ads are no longer generated by
Google, but they will still work if you choose not to upgrade.
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 221

Link unit example
Suppose you decided to display a link unit with five links and a dimension of 120 × 90
pixels. Here’s the code AdSense would generate for you to copy and paste:
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-5493015234961725";
/* 120x90, created 1/28/09 */
google_ad_slot = "4665943536";
google_ad_width = 120;
google_ad_height = 90;
//-->
</script>
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js">
</script>
Paste the link unit code into one of your web pages (or an include file), and copy the
pages or include file to your server. The link unit will then appear on your site, hardly
taking up any space at all, and look just like more links, as shown in Figures 8-14 and
8-24 beneath the ad unit. If you click on one of the links in the link unit, a Google page
consisting of contextual ads will open (Figure 8-25).
Where to Place AdSense Ads on Your Pages
Publishers may well wonder where they should place AdSense ads on their pages for
the best results. There’s a great deal of speculation about AdSense ad placement in
webmaster circles, but not much hard data.
It is clear that ads placed above the fold—meaning in the top third of the page where
they will be seen on any computer monitor without scrolling down—do better than
ads placed lower on a page.
The best performing AdSense ad format and position is Leaderboard (also called a
horizontal skyscraper) close to the top of a page. The second-best format is one of the
several vertical skyscraper formats (Skyscraper and Wide Skyscraper), with the top ad
very close to the top of the page, either along the left or right side. If a vertical skyscraper
is positioned along the right side of a page, then you need to take care to use a page
design with a total width of less than 800 pixels so the skyscraper along the righthand
side will display without horizontal scrolling on all monitors.
Beyond this basic placement information, you might want to consider whether it makes
sense to put many ads on a single page (the Google limit is three ad units). There’s
something to be said for placing many ads on a page—the variety might produce good
choices for more visitors. However, the “noise” of displaying many ads can detract from
your site and some publishers get better results with fewer ads.
The bottom line is that you should experiment with ad placement and the number of
ads on your site. What works well for your site is not necessarily what works well for
another site, so there is no substitute for trial and error. To assist publishers, if you have
222 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

linked your Google AdSense and Google Analytics accounts, you can begin to test and
measure performance, as shown in Figure 8-57 later in this chapter.
Figure 8-24. An ad unit is shown above a link unit
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 223

Figure 8-25. Clicking the link unit opens a page of related ads hosted by Google
Managing Ads
Click the Manage Ads link on the AdSense Setup tab to open the Manage Ads page,
shown in Figure 8-26. The Manage Ads page lets you modify ads you’ve already created.
It’s a very nice feature that lets you change ads on the fly without having to change the
code in your web pages.
To change the settings for a specific ad, click the Edit Ad Settings link.
224 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Ads cannot be deleted (so that you don’t make a mistake and delete an
ad that is in use). However, if you are no longer using an ad, you can
click the Hide link and it will not be displayed.
Figure 8-26. You can change the settings for a specific ad on the fly without having to change the code
in your web pages
Custom Ad Colors
Suppose you don’t like the default color schemes for ads that Google offers. You can
create new color schemes or modify an existing scheme by clicking the Color Palettes
link on the AdSense Setup tab.
You can also open the Color Palettes page by clicking the “Manage color
palettes” link from Choose Ad Color and Formats page.
Using the Color Palettes page, you start with one of the built-in Google palettes. Next,
you can modify each of the colored elements of the palette, either by specifying an RGB
hexadecimal color value or by choosing colors from a color picker (see Figure 8-27).
Once you have the color scheme you want, you can save your custom palette (using
any name you’d like). Your custom palette will be added to the list on the Choose Ad
Color and Formats page (Figure 8-28).
I’m explaining using custom color palettes in the context of AdSense
ads. You should know that much of AdSense’s customization features,
such as channels and colors, work for AdSense for Search and AdSense
for Domains as well as straight ad units, even though I haven’t specifi-
cally noted it.

Figure 8-28. Custom palettes are available on the Choose Ad Color and Formats page
226 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Using Channels
The Channels page, opened by clicking the Channels link on the AdSense Setup tab,
lets you define URL and custom channels.
URL channels are tracked by web address, and you can add these at any point. You
can use URL channels to track a single page, a directory in a domain, or an entire
domain. For example, the URL channel www.digitalfieldguide.com will track ads served
and clicked on this URL and ads on any page below that address (for example, ads on
pages in www.digitalfieldguide.com/blog/). In contrast, the URL channel www.digital
fieldguide.com/index.php tracks activity only on the page index.php. Figure 8-29 shows
the interface for creating and managing URL channels.
For information about using URL channel information to understand
your Google AdSense activity, see Chapter 9.
Custom channels are not limited by the domain and directory structure of your web
server, and track activity from an ad unit—wherever it is located—that is linked to the
custom channel. The catch is that for this to work, you need to have created the custom
channel and associated the ad unit with that channel before deploying the ad unit. In
contrast, you can always add a URL channel (but URL channels are not flexible in terms
of the information they report).
The need to specify a custom URL channel before you deploy your ad
code is a serious drawback. Things do change often and quickly on the
Web. Adding or changing custom channels means changing the actual
ad unit code in your pages.
Custom channels allow you to track AdSense information as you’d like to see it, perhaps
divided by subject matter rather than web addresses. In addition, one important use of
custom channels is to allow advertisers to use a channel as an ad target, meaning to
place ads only on the pages referenced by your channel. This allows you to carve out
web “real estate” aimed at specific kinds of advertisers—for example, only pages that
relate to digital cameras. To implement a custom channel as an advertisement target,
click the edit settings link for the custom channel in the page used to create and manage
custom channels shown in Figure 8-30.

Applying Competitive Filters
Sometimes it’s a good idea to filter ads so that they don’t appear on your site. The most
common reason for doing this is to make sure that competitors’ ads don’t appear on
your site, but you might also simply want to make sure that ads from organizations you
find offensive don’t appear beside your web content.
To block ads, based on their display URL or destination URL, from appearing on your
site, click the Competitive Ad Filter link found on the AdSense for Content tab. Enter
the addresses you want to ban in the box shown in Figure 8-31.
Figure 8-31. You can easily filter out ads from your competitors or ads that you find offensive
Finding that Offensive URL
Suppose an AdSense ad that you really don’t like and want to ban appears on your site.
Bearing in mind that you are not supposed to click on ads on your own site, how do
you determine what URL to use in the Competitive Ad Filters dialog to exclude the ad?
Following these steps will let you find the URL you need to ban:
1. Right-click the ad title (the portion of the ad that is a hyperlink).
AdSense for Content Ad Settings | 229

2. If you are using Internet Explorer, select Copy Shortcut. On Firefox or Safari, the
command will be something like Copy Link Location.
3. Paste the selection into a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit.
4. The destination URL for the ad will appear following the adurl= portion of the
URL, and continue up to the ampersand (&).
For example, if the pasted selection is something like this (portions of the ad string have
been omitted):
http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/adclick?sa=l&..
.&adurl=http://www.
competitiontermite.com&client=...
then the destination URL is http://www.competitiontermite.com.
Site Authentication, Ad Review, and Allowed Sites
There are some other settings you should know about, accessed as links on the AdSense
Setup tab. Depending on your situation, you may never want to use these settings. On
the other hand, for some sites they are quite important:
Site Authentication
Site Authentication allows the Googlebot to get behind a login on a password
protected site using the identification you provide. The point here is to allow Ad-
Sense to target ads to the content on pages that it wouldn’t otherwise be able to
access for contextual analysis purposes.
Ad Review
The Ad Review Center is used to allow or block ads that have been specifically
targeted to your site.
Allow Sites
The Allow Sites page is the logical converse of the Competitive Filter page. If you
choose, using this page you can block all advertisers except those you specifically
allow. Note, however, that this will likely not be in the interest of any content owner
except one with a very specific and targeted advertising base.
AdSense for Search Settings
As I’ve noted, AdSense for Search allows you to add a customized search box to your
site, and to make money from the ads on the search results page.
To get the code for placing a search box on your web pages, open the AdSense Setup
page and click AdSense for Search. You can then choose from various options, including
whether you want to have the box search specified domains or the entire Web, and
what language should be used.
230 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

The site search box is a nifty alternative to Google’s web search box. You set this box
up by choosing your domain as the site to search (rather than the entire Web) as shown
in Figure 8-32.
Figure 8-32. AdSense for Search lets you implement a site search box that is useful to your site
visitors—and can make you money
Google can only return results from pages it has indexed, so the site search box results
of your domains will only be as good as Google’s job of indexing your site. Usually,
this is pretty good indeed—so you have a double whammy advantage: users can search
your site with a state-of-the-art tool and you potentially increase your revenue.
You can also make some simple layout selections, as shown in Figure 8-33, and decide
to exclude adult content from searches by enabling SafeSearch (this option is further
down the dialog).
With search box units, as with ad units, you use channels to track the performance of
your search boxes. You can also apply competitive search filters to block ads from
specific URLs from appearing on the pages generated by your search results. You can
change the configuration of a search box you’ve saved using Manage Ads, explained
earlier in this chapter.
Once you’ve configured the appearance of the search box, you also need to set the
appearance of the search results page as shown in Figure 8-34. Besides using a palette
to set the color of text and page elements, you can upload a logo for the page and set
the destination that opens when someone clicks on the logo. More important, you can
choose to have Google serve the search results page in the open browser window, have
Google serve the search results page in a new window, or have the search results appear
on one of your own pages.

Figure 8-34. You can determine many aspects of the way the search results page looks
232 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

With your search box and results page options set, next you’ll save the unit settings so
you can tweak them as needed. Finally, AdSense generates code for you to use as shown
in Figure 8-35.
Figure 8-35. Click within the code box to select the search box code for copying
Copy and paste the code into your web pages. The search box will appear with the
options you selected (Figure 8-36); when someone searches your site, the results page
will show relevant advertisements (Figure 8-37).

AdSense for Feeds
As I explained in Chapter 3, a syndication feed is a mechanism for widely distributing
your content in a standardized XML format. If you create an AdSense for Feeds ad unit,
and associate one or more syndication feeds with it, then contextual AdSense ads will
appear in your feeds. The object, of course, is for you to make money from these ads.
To start, on the AdSense Setup page, click the AdSense for Feeds link. Create a unit as
shown in Figure 8-38, specifying whether it should display text ads only or text and
image ads, how often the ads should appear, and where the ads should be positioned.
Figure 8-38. To start placing ads in your feeds, you need to add an AdSense for Feeds unit
An AdSense for Feeds unit without an associated feed doesn’t do anything; the next
step is to associate a feed with the ad unit.
FeedBurner, part of Google as I mentioned in Chapter 7, provides a service where any
valid syndication feed is “burnt”—meaning hosted and made available for redistribu-
tion. If you already have a feed burnt in FeedBurner, clicking the Move FeedBurner
feeds to your Google account link makes it easy to move the feed as shown in Fig-
ure 8-39 to add it to your AdSense unit.
AdSense for Feeds | 235

Figure 8-39. The easiest way to move a feed is to use one already registered at FeedBurner
If you don’t have any FeedBurner feeds yet, the other approach is to create one. Start
by clicking the “Burn new feed” link shown in Figure 8-38. You’ll be prompted to enter
the address for the feed, as shown in Figure 8-40.
Figure 8-40. The first step in activating a new feed is to verify its address
236 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

If the feed is verified at the address you supplied, you will be prompted to add a title
for the feed as shown in Figure 8-41.
Figure 8-41. Once you’ve verified a new feed, Publisher Tools can be used to track the feed
Click Next and your new feed is burnt in FeedBurner. Whether you moved or created
a feed, in the AdSense feed ad unit setup you need to add the feed to your Google
account as shown in Figure 8-42.
Figure 8-42. Click add to add a feed to the AdSense unit
AdSense for Feeds | 237

By the way, once you have a FeedBurner feed, there are many ways to make use of it
with the tools you’ll find at http://feedburner.google.com/. For example, you can easily
setup a subscription to an email version of your feed as shown in Figure 8-43 by clicking
on your feed, choosing the Publicize tab, selecting Email Subscriptions, and adding the
code provided to your web page.
Figure 8-43. You can let users subscribe to an email delivery of your feed
Figure 8-44 shows a portion of an actual syndication feed with an AdSense ad below
the text of the feed item.
Figure 8-44. An AdSense ad is shown in this syndication feed
Generally, once you’ve set up a FeedBurner feed and registered it with an AdSense for
Feed ad unit, it makes sense to aggregate all related feeds so that they redirect to the
version with ads. Doing this depends on the software you are using to generate the feed.
You’ll find instructions for most common blogging software at http://www.google.com/
support/feedburner/bin/topic.py?topic=13055.
If you are using WordPress, the easiest way to aggregate your feeds so that all relevant
feed addresses display the FeedBurner content with the Google ads is to install the
FeedSmith plug-in. Once the FeedSmith plug-in has been installed, you configure it by
entering the FeedBurner address as shown in Figure 8-45 and the plug-in takes care of
the rest.
238 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Figure 8-45. The syndication feeds generated by WordPress have been redirected to the FeedBurner
version of the feed
AdSense for Domains
AdSense for Domains is a program for parked domains, meaning domains that are not
in active use. There are many reasons someone might want to park a domain, including
the intention of speculating in domain names and protecting existing related domain
names from falling into the hands of competitors.
In the AdSense for Domains program, you redirect the site to Google’s servers and
Google supplies content and advertising based on the domain name, the keywords you
supply, and the visual scheme you choose.
AdSense for Domains seems like an “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em”
strategy: recognizing that parked domains are a magnet for spam web-
sites, Google is offering a way to present quality spam that is under their
control.
To get started with AdSense for Domains, from the AdSense Setup page, click AdSense
for Domains. Next, add your parked domains as shown in Figure 8-46.
The next step is to follow Google’s directions to modify the DNS (Domain Name Server)
records at your domain registrar. This allows Google access to your parked site to add
the content.
AdSense for Domains | 239

Figure 8-46. Add the domains you want to include in the program
If you’ve registered your domain with one of the more popular domain registrars,
Google provides detailed step-by-step instructions for how to make these changes.
When you add a domain, you’ll see a link to these instructions as shown in Figure 8-47.
If your domain registrar is not on this list, you’ll have to figure out how to make these
changes on your own. It’s not as daunting as it may sound, but it’s not possible at all
domain registrars—in which case your best option is to transfer the domain to a reg-
istrar that allows you to modify the records and is on Google’s list with detailed
instructions.
Transferring domains is reasonably routine, but the kind of bureaucratic
process between automated entities that can make adults quake. Gen-
erally, the new registrar issues a transfer instruction. At the old registrar,
you unlock the domain (if it is locked) and get a transfer authorization
code, which you supply to the new registrar. The new registrar then
accepts the domain and the old registrar releases it (which may take
human intervention).
240 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Figure 8-47. Google provides instructions for modifying the settings at your domain registrar
Next, enter the A record and CNAME record settings that Google provides at your
domain registrar as shown in Figure 8-48.
Figure 8-48. Modified DNS records are shown in this ISP’s control panel
Once you’ve modified the records, and Google has verified and approved your parked
domains included in the program, you can customize each domain.
To change the settings for a parked domain, select the domain in the AdSense for
Domains window. Then choose Edit from the Actions drop-down menu.
First, set the color scheme for the site as shown in Figure 8-49.
AdSense for Domains | 241

Figure 8-49. You can specify the color scheme for your parked domain
The most important customization is to add some keywords to help Google understand
the primary thrust of the domain name. You add optional keyword hints as shown in
Figure 8-50.
Figure 8-50. Adding keywords helps Google figure out what the domain is about
You are limited to a maximum of four keywords per parked domain.
With your settings in place, you can open the parked site as shown in Figure 8-51 to
review the appearance of your new parked domain.
242 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

Changes made in the Google AdSense Setup to parked domains may
take a while to actually propagate to the domain.
Figure 8-51. The parked domain now features advertising content provided by Google
It’s clear that Google doesn’t pay much attention to the keywords you select when
preparing site content; as you can see in Figure 8-51, there’s not much connection to
either the name of the domain or the keywords specified in Figure 8-50.
Video Units
What content is more compelling then video? And how better to monetize this com-
pelling content on your site than by adding video units from Google’s YouTube, a leader
in online video?
To get started, from the AdSense Setup page, click Video unit. You will need to login
to your YouTube account (or create an account if you don’t have one already). Next,
you’ll be prompted to name and design a video player as shown in Figure 8-52.
Google analyzes the site on which you put a video unit to help determine the content
of the unit, but you can give this decision a nudge by adding content keywords, cate-
gories, and channels as shown in Figure 8-53.
Video Units | 243

Figure 8-53. You help Google determine the videos that will play by selecting content-related
keywords, categories, and channels
244 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

After you’ve made your selection, Google generates code for you as shown in Fig-
ure 8-54. As with other Google AdSense products, it is your job to copy and paste the
code into position on your web pages.
Figure 8-54. Copy and paste the video unit code into your web pages
Once the code has been copied and pasted into your web page, the video unit displays
along with some Google ads as shown in Figure 8-55.
Figure 8-55. Text ads incorporated in a video unit are likely to relate to the site hosting the unit rather
than the video content
Video Units | 245

For demonstration purposes, I pasted the video unit into a site related
to pregnancy issues. As you can see in Figure 8-55, Google is a lot better
at finding text ads that relate to this topic than YouTube video content.
The moral: be careful where you paste these video units, as their content
may not be appropriate for every site.
Linking Google AdSense to Google Analytics
Google AdSense now allows you to integrate your Google Analytics accounts to provide
you with more detailed information about traffic and how users interact with your
website. When you link your accounts, you will find a new AdSense menu under the
Content section of the lefthand navigation in your Google Analytics, as shown in
Figure 8-56.
Figure 8-56. New Google AdSense Content tab is available after linking accounts
246 | Chapter 8: Working with AdSense

You will notice some differences between the reporting within Google AdSense and
Google Analytics due to a number of factors, so it is possible to view a AdSense Metrics
Differences report to show the actual difference between the two accounts. You can
see in Figure 8-57 you can get a very detailed overview of how your AdSense is per-
forming, which Content or Referrers are producing the most revenue.

CHAPTER 9
Making Sense of AdSense
Putting AdSense code on your web pages is only the beginning of making money with
Google AdSense advertising. Once you’ve added AdSense for Content and the other
AdSense products explained in Chapter 8 to your pages, you need to know how well
your AdSense revenue is doing in relationship to how well it could be doing. Monitoring
your performance so you can make changes to make more money is a very important
part of successfully working with AdSense.
This chapter explains the reporting and performance tracking tools available in the
AdSense program and what you should be looking for in terms of performance.
Fundamentals of Navigation
When you log into AdSense from the AdSense home page at https://www.google.com/
adsense/ (after your account is up and running and you have ads on your site), the first
thing you’ll see is the Reports Overview window, with the current day’s earnings dis-
played, as shown in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1. You’ll see your page impressions, clicks, and other data related to today’s earnings
249

Scrolling down the page shown in Figure 9-1, you’ll see links to optimization tips
(Figure 9-2) and links to premade custom reports (Figure 9-3). Note that these custom
reports open in the Advanced Report window preloaded with the specified content.
Figure 9-2. AdSense automatically provides optimization tips
Figure 9-3. Quick report links open premade reports in the Advanced Report window
250 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Returning to the initial daily earnings screen (shown in Figure 9-1), click the top chan-
nels links shown to see the statistics for your top-performing channels (Figure 9-4).
Figure 9-4. The top channels display lets you see at a glance which of your channels are performing
(products for channels besides AdSense for Content not shown)
When you click the Advanced Reports tab (or view AdSense channels links), the Ad-
vanced Reports window opens, as shown in Figure 9-5. This is used as an extensive
and complete way to monitor your performance in the AdSense for Content program.
Fundamentals of Navigation | 251

Figure 9-5. You can customize reports on the Advanced Reports tab
Once you really get going with AdSense, you are quite likely to have a number of
custom reports you’ll need to organize and keep track of (see “Running Re-
ports” on page 254). That’s where the Report Manager, shown in Figure 9-6, comes in.
Figure 9-6. Report Manager lets you organize reports
252 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Understanding the Metrics
Now that you understand the basics of navigating the AdSense revenue reporting
mechanism, it’s time to consider what the numbers reported mean and how you can
get increased value out of the reporting.
It’s quite appropriate that the Ad Performance statistics should be the first thing you
see in the AdSense application, because as an AdSense publisher, you need to keep a
close watch on these statistics. This chapter goes into the details of slicing and dicing
the information you can get from the Report screen, but let’s start with the mile-high
view first.
The most important statistic for you to pay attention to is the CTR, or click-through
rate. CTR measures the percentage of times visitors click, and can be broken down on
the basis of what is being clicked into Page CTR (page percentage click-through rate),
Ad Unit CTR (ad unit percentage click-through rate), and Ad CTR (the percentage of
times an individual ad is clicked). Page CTR tells you how effective your pages are as
hosts for advertising, and Ad and Ad Unit CTR tell you how well specific ads and ad
configurations work.
Page CTR should be in the 0.5 percent to 2 percent range (meaning that an ad is clicked
from 1 to 4 out of every 200 times a page is displayed). As you’ll see when you learn
about the AdWords program in Chapter 10, a 2 percent Ad CTR is a home run; it’s
more normal to expect something slightly below 1 percent.
Click-through rates are higher for ads displayed on Google search results
pages than they are on web content pages, perhaps because it is easier
to serve really relevant ads when people are searching for something
specific rather than simply surfing web pages.
If your Ad CTR is consistently below 0.5 percent for more than a day or two—as those
shown in Figure 9-7 are—meaning fewer than 1 in 200 ads are clicked, then you need
to take remedial action because your traffic is going to waste.
Most likely, the problem is that Google is not able to accurately serve relevant ads on
your pages because you haven’t written the pages to clearly present the most important
content they contain (see Chapter 4 for information about how to fix this). Try tweaking
your pages to emphasize their significant content areas. In addition, try changing the
position of the AdSense ad units on your page, the kind of ad units, and the graphic
schemes used in these ad units (see Chapter 8 for information about changing ad units
and their palettes). It’s also worth seeing what happens when you change the number
of ads and ad units per page. Carefully monitor the Reports tab to see which of these
measures improves your CTR.
Understanding the Metrics | 253

Figure 9-7. You can see at a glance how many times your pages have been displayed (page impressions)
and how many people have clicked on the Google ads on your pages
You should also be monitoring your comparative performance. Over
time—using fairly broad time slices such as weeks or months—is the
absolute number of impressions going up (or down)? And what about
CTR? If either the number of impressions or your CTR is declining, you
should be concerned and consider revisiting your ad layouts and site
content and positioning.
Running Reports
The Advanced Reports interface is designed to generate reports. To generate a report,
pick your date range, select page or unit impressions, choose aggregate versus channel
data (and select your channels), and click Display Report.
The initial AdSense settings are to display an aggregate page unit report
for the current day. When you log into AdSense subsequently, it displays
the settings for the most recent report you ran. The best idea probably
is to generate daily reports to get a sense of how your AdSense account
is doing in real time. You may also want to generate weekly and monthly
reports to get a more long-term perspective.
254 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Saving a Report as a Template
It’s useful to be able to save a report you’ve generated as a template. That way, you
don’t have to figure out all over again how to generate the report. You can also arrange
to have a report that’s been saved as a template sent to you by email on a regular basis.
To save a report as a template, once you’ve generated a report, give it a name in the
Save as Report Template box as shown in Figure 9-8 and click Save.
Figure 9-8. Saving a report as a template makes it easy to get the same data over time
Once you’ve saved a report as a template, you can open an updated version of the report
whenever you like on the Reports Overview page under Quick Reports as shown in
Figure 9-9.
Figure 9-9. The new report is shown on the Quick Reports list of report templates
You can also arrange to have the data in the report emailed to you at selected periods
of time. To do this, open the Report Manager window, check the report, and enter an
email address as shown in Figure 9-10.
Running Reports | 255

Figure 9-10. You can have the updated data in a report template emailed to you
Choosing a Date Range
When you build a report, you can choose any data range you’d like, by date, from the
inception of your AdSense account to the current point in time, all using the interface
shown in Figure 9-11; or you can choose one of the preset time spans that Google always
has available.
Figure 9-11. You can choose a preset time span or a date range
The preset time spans are:
• Today
• Yesterday
• 2 days ago
• Last 7 days
• This month
• Last month
• This week (Monday–Sunday)
• Last week (Monday–Sunday)
• Last business week (Monday–Friday)
• All time
256 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

The “all time” preset time period means from the beginning of your
AdSense account through the current day; it does not include the age of
the dinosaurs or the birth of the Roman Empire.
Page, Unit, or Ad Impressions
Google lets you put more than one ad unit on a single page, and each ad unit has
multiple ads. Therefore, it makes sense to be able to display impressions (the number
of times something is displayed) by page, unit, or ad using the drop-down list shown
in Figure 9-12.
Figure 9-12. Individual ad unit impressions are likely to have a higher number than page impressions
in the aggregate because you can have more than one ad unit per page
If you put a single ad unit on each of your pages, then displaying data
by page or unit will show the same thing.
It’s easy to be tempted to throw four AdSense units (three ad units and one link unit)
up on each of your pages, but try to resist this temptation. Experienced webmasters
generally find that CTR goes down as pages become too loaded with ads—even
AdSense ads.
Aggregate Versus Channel Data
You can choose to display AdSense data for your entire account by selecting the
Aggregate data radio button shown in Figure 9-13.
Figure 9-13. You can view your data as a whole or separated by channels
Running Reports | 257

Alternatively, you can select Channel data to show as many or as few channels as you’d
like. If you choose Channel data, the drop-down box shown in Figure 9-14 will appear,
and you can select the channels you’d like by checking the box next to the name of the
channel. The drop-down list displays both custom and URL channels.
Figure 9-14. If you display data by channel, you can choose from URL channels or from custom
channels
As explained in Chapter 8, URL channels display information from the
specified web address. In contrast, custom channels can be applied to
whichever ad units you’d like to group together—for example, they can
span multiple domains and not include all units in those domains—but
must be specified before the ad units are created and included in the ad
unit code.
When you are showing data by Channel, you can use the Group data by radio buttons
to display statistics organized by date, channel, or grouped using both.
Clicking the manage channels link opens the Channels page on the Ad-
Sense Setup tab, explained in Chapter 8.
258 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Statistics
A famous aphorism says, “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics,”
meaning you can support any statement and sound authoritative, so long as you quote
statistics. Fortunately, the statistics shown in an AdSense Ad Performance report are
simple enough that they are hard to misinterpret, but you should be clear about the
terminology used.
Each report will show you daily statistics (each of these is a column in the AdSense
report, as shown in Figure 9-15):
Impressions
An ad impression is recorded each time an AdSense ad unit is displayed. A page
impression is recorded each time a web page containing an AdSense ad unit is
displayed. A single display of a web page containing three ad units would produce
one page impression and three ad impressions.
Clicks
A visitor’s click on an ad on a publisher’s page. Public service ad clicks are not
included in this statistic.
Google reserves the right to audit clicks and retroactively remove
clicks that it deems invalid—for example, if Google finds you have
been clicking ads on your own pages. These clicks will show up in
the report that is displayed, even though you won’t make any
money from them.
CTR
CTR (click-through rate) is the number of clicks an ad unit receives divided by the
number of times the ad unit is displayed (ad unit impressions).
eCPM
Effective CPM (eCPM; cost per thousand impressions) is calculated by dividing
the total earnings by the number of impressions in thousands. For example, if a
publisher earned $100 from 20,000 impressions, the eCPM would equal $100/20,
or $5. The point of this metric is to provide a way to compare AdSense’s CPC
revenue with the money you might make from other forms of advertising, such as
affiliate advertising (see Chapter 5) or CPM (see Chapter 6).
Your earnings
This column shows your earnings, either in aggregate or for selected channels.
These are not final numbers and may be subject to adjustments. (See “Your Earn-
ings” on page 265 for information about final earnings numbers.)
Statistics | 259

Figure 9-15. You should monitor your earnings for trends and inconsistencies (such as the relatively
poor result shown on Thursday in this figure)
The Point of eCPM
eCPM is related to CTR—the higher the CTR, the better the eCPM comparison. Google
includes this metric as a way to compare apples to apples—AdSense CPC with con-
ventional CPM advertising—and stacks the deck slightly in its own favor while doing
so. (I would, too, if I had a program that delivers as well as AdSense.)
The normal cost of CPM advertising is in the $3 to $4 ballpark. If you have a reasonable
CTR (anything better than about 1.5 percent), your eCPM will demonstrate that you
are doing significantly better than you would have with conventional CPM advertising.
You can sort the report by one of these columns by clicking the column
headers. For example, if you have a month’s worth of data displayed
and want to see it with the day with most clicks displayed first, clicking
on Clicks will accomplish this sort.
Downloading a CSV File
You can download the data in your AdSense report by clicking the CSV file link (shown
in the upper right of Figure 9-15). The file is a plain text file formatted with comma-
separated values, and it can be opened in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft
Excel (shown in Figure 9-16) for further analysis.
260 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Figure 9-16. Downloading AdSense report data into Excel allows you to use the full power of Excel
to manipulate and display the information
Other Program Performance
Of course, AdSense for Content ad units are not the only components of AdSense. The
other AdSense programs—Search, Content, Domains, and Feeds—are reported in
pretty much the same way as AdSense for Content units. However, AdSense for Search
and AdSense for Domains do report some additional metrics that are worth noting.
Search Performance
You can display an AdSense for Search report in almost exactly the same way as an
AdSense for Content report. To generate a Search report, on the Reports tab, click the
Search Performance link. You can then display a report, as shown in Figure 9-17.
Other Program Performance | 261

Figure 9-17. You can display reports for AdSense for Search pretty much in the same way as for
AdSense for Content
One difference between an AdSense for Search report and an AdSense for Content
report is that AdSense for Search can’t display information by unit impressions, only
by page impressions because ads are displayed on Google’s search results pages, not
your pages (unless you’ve elected to open search results on your own site).
You’ll also notice that the AdSense for Search report lists Queries. These are the times
someone used the search box to make a search.
A click is counted when someone searches using your search box, and then clicks on
one of the sponsored links on the results page.
How Are Your Parked Domains Doing?
You may be surprised by how much your parked domains can make. But, who knows?
Why not find out for sure?
Reporting for AdSense for Domains, shown in Figure 9-18, is primarily formulated in
page impressions. Landing page impressions are generated when a user visits the do-
main. Results page impressions are generated when a user submits a query into the
search box or clicks on a Related Search link on the site. Total page impressions is
simply the aggregate of your landing page impressions and results page impressions.
262 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Figure 9-18. Total page impressions is landing page impressions plus results page impressions
Optimization Tips
On the Overview tab of AdSense Setup, you’ll find links to both general optimization
tips and optimization tips reports that have been created specifically for your account.
The optimization tip links look like those shown in Figure 9-19.
Figure 9-19. An optimization report is prepared monthly for each AdSense account
Figure 9-20 shows an example of a monthly optimization report. Of course, these re-
ports are generated automatically, but you still should take a look at them from time
to time.
Optimization Tips | 263

Figure 9-20. Optimization reports provide tips about how to improve your results
Site Diagnostics
The Site Diagnostics tab of AdSense Setup lists a number of possible problems detected
in your pages when they were crawled. Typically, these are broken URLs or pages
blocked by a robots.txt file.
If your web pages show these problems, the page will provide a link to documentation
about how to fix the issue.
Most often, you’ll need to unblock URLs by adding the following text to the top of
your robots.txt files.
User-agent: Mediapartners-Google 
Disallow:
See Chapter 4 for more information about working with your
robots.txt file to exclude (and not exclude) crawling of your pages.

Your Earnings
Strictly speaking, your earnings and payment history are not advertising performance.
But, of course, to you they may be the most important metric of all.
To monitor your actual earnings (as opposed to your ad performance), choose the My
Account tab and click the Payment History link. As you can see in Figure 9-21, you will
be shown your month-by-month earnings for any time period you select.
Figure 9-21. Your actual earnings are displayed on the My Account tab
Your earnings can be downloaded as a comma-separated value file (by clicking the CSV
link shown in the upper left of Figure 9-21). This file can be imported into Excel for
further analysis.
If you click an Earnings link in the Description column for a particular month, a detail
report (an example is shown in Figure 9-22) will break out the revenue source between
AdSense for Content and AdSense for Search.
Detailed monthly information can also be downloaded as a CSV file.
Your Earnings | 265

Figure 9-22. The detailed monthly earnings screen shows you how much revenue came from AdSense
for Content and how much came from AdSense for Search, as well as income from other programs
such as AdSense for Domains
Tools Beyond AdSense for Tracking
“Trust, but verify” is an excellent motto in life. It’s nice to have independent verification
of Google’s numbers and also better analysis tools of visitor behavior than the AdSense
reports provide. You now have the option of linking your account to Google Analytics.
To get third-party information about your traffic, a good starting place is to visit
Alexa. On Alexa, click the Traffic Rankings tab. Enter your site domain in the box and
click Get Traffic Details. The Related Info page for your site will open. Next, in the
Explore this Site box, click the Traffic Details link.
A number of different measures of your site traffic, including the daily page views graph
shown in Figure 9-23, will be displayed.
You can use the Alexa metrics as a reality check in terms of whether it agrees with
Google that your page views are going up (or down) over time, but you cannot use
Alexa as an absolute measure of anything because of how the Alexa statistics are com-
piled. Alexa’s page-view metrics are based on information uploaded from a small
toolbar, mostly installed by business users. This information is notoriously flawed for
consumer sites, particularly ones without high traffic.
The next place to turn is your web server’s logs.
266 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

Figure 9-23. Alexa can give you an idea of how many daily page views your site receives
Listening to Web Logs
Depending on your web host, you should have access to a number of tools used to
generate usable information from your web logs files. Web log analysis is the first and
best place to look for data in addition to that supplied by Google.
Raw web log files provide copious and dense information, but it is hard
to extract anything usable from them.
Webalizer, shown providing monthly statistics in Figure 9-24, is available for almost
all sites that are hosted on a Linux-based web server. If your web host doesn’t make
Webalizer available to you, it almost surely will provide comparable software.
Web Log Analysis Programs
There are many good web log analysis programs available with much the same func-
tionality as Webalizer, the one shown in this section. Popular offerings include Access
Watch, Piwik, ModLogAn, NetTracker, and WebTrends.
Tools Beyond AdSense for Tracking | 267

Many of these programs are free; others, such as WebTrends—which offers additional
facilities for tracking visitors through your site as explained in “Web Analytic Soft-
ware” on page 273—are fee-based.
Which web log analysis program you have access to depends upon the operating system
of your web server and (assuming you are working with a web hosting company to
serve your web pages) the software made available by your web host.
Figure 9-24. Webalizer uses your web logs to display statistics about your site
You can use the Webalizer monthly summary shown in Figure 9-24 to see if it confirms
the trends shown in Google’s accounting of your page views. Next, click a specific
month to get more detailed information about a whole range of topics, including:
• Daily usage (Figure 9-25)
268 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

• Hourly usage
• Top URLs on your site (your pages that have the most visitors)
• Top entry pages on your site (the pages most often used as the entry point to your
domain)
• Top exit pages on your site (the pages most often used as the exit point for leaving
your domain, Figure 9-26)
• Top referrer pages (the pages, by address, that have referred the most traffic to your
site, Figure 9-27)
• Top search strings used (in search engines) to find your site (Figure 9-28)
A great deal of the information provided is quite valuable. You should certainly keep
an eye on daily usage statistics (Figure 9-25).
Figure 9-25. Monitoring daily usage statistics helps you make sure that your site traffic is staying
steady or gaining
Tools Beyond AdSense for Tracking | 269

You probably already have a good idea of your entry pages, the pages that visitors first
open when they access your site (but it’s still a good idea to verify this information with
your web log analysis tool). These pages are also often called landing pages. But you
may not know about your top exit pages—the last page a visitor opens in your site—
shown in Webalizer in Figure 9-26.
Figure 9-26. Exit pages are the final page viewed in your domain before leaving your site
Exit pages are significant because you may wish to make an attempt to keep traffic on
your site on the top exit pages. You might want to try tinkering with the imagery or
adding stronger or more subtle calls to action.
More important, studies have shown that exit pages are a particularly good place to
put AdSense ads. The logic is your visitors are ready to leave your site anyhow, so they
are likely to be more willing to click on a link in an ad. Therefore, it makes sense to pay
special attention to your top exit pages when you tweak your AdSense content ads.
This tip is worth highlighting: consider AdSense placements on exit
pages a top priority.
Referrers are sites that refer traffic to you. It’s good to know where your traffic is coming
from. Figure 9-27 shows some top referrers for the site http://www.digitalfieldguide.com.
270 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

The first entry shown in Figure 9-27, Direct Request, represents visitors
who simply entered the URL for the site in their browser and didn’t
come via a link from another site. If a visitor has set your site as their
home page in their browser, it will also show up here.
Figure 9-27. The top referrer table helps you to know where your traffic is coming from
Using information about your top referrers, you can work to strengthen your relation-
ship with these referrers and also consider if there are other sites like a particular referrer
Tools Beyond AdSense for Tracking | 271

that you might be able to approach for traffic (see Chapter 3 for advice about how to
approach a site).
You can also use the top referrer list to understand the “stickiness” of your site. In other
words, which pages most often refer users to other pages within your site? These re-
ferring pages that cross links represent valuable real estate that should be monetized
via AdSense as extensively as possible, because they are a clue to the core interests of
your user base.
Figure 9-28 shows a table of the top search strings used in search engines to find your
site.
Figure 9-28. Top search string information is extremely valuable because it allows you to hone your
site content
Knowing the top search strings used to find your site is extraordinarily valuable to an
AdSense publisher. Honing your site to provide information relevant to these searches
sets you up to benefit from a virtuous circle: more targeted information draws better
search engine rankings for these queries, which in turn draw more traffic and at the
same time generates better CTR because it’s easier for Google’s contextual engine to
figure out what your site is about.
272 | Chapter 9: Making Sense of AdSense

You should also analyze a more extensive keyword list, perhaps the top 1,000 keywords,
to look for themes, meaning two and three word queries that have a recurring common
word or topic. In other words, you may not get much traffic from “butterfly” but you
may get a lot of traffic from many keywords containing “butterfly” or “butterflies” that
only refer two or three visitors each.
As you can see, there’s a great deal of information to be had from your web log data,
and it is important to keep on top of it to get the most revenue out of the AdSense
program. Pay particular attention to the overall direction of traffic volume, the flow of
traffic through your site via entrance and exit pages, and top referrers and search strings.
Web Analytic Software
When your web log software is not enough, because you really need to understand
visitor behavior in detail through your site, it’s time to turn to web analytic software
such as Google Analytics and WebTrends (which also does web log analysis). These
are complex software packages that may require professional assistance to implement
fully. Google Analytics is free, while WebTrends requires a licensing fee.
WebTrends is available as a standalone product (you install it on your web server) or
as a hosted solution. Google Analytics is only available as a hosted solution. In some
cases—when your content is behind a firewall—you may need to deploy Google Ur
chin in addition to Google Analytics.
In a hosted solution, you add a small bit of code to your pages—much
in the way Google AdSense works—and the software company takes
care of the rest.
This sophisticated category of software can be used to track almost everything about
every visitor to your site. For example, Google Analytics will also tell you how many
people bounced off your landing page, meaning they didn’t go beyond the first page of
your site. If you have a high bounce-off rate, you need to know it so you can redesign
your site to pull visitors in. If you link your Google Analytics and AdSense accounts,
you can link this behavior back to AdSense revenue.
If you are using AdWords to advertise and are selling a product, as I
explain in Part III, a key feature in Google Analytics allows you to track
how many visitors are converted into customers, what they buy, and
even which link they clicked to make the purchase.
You’ll find more information about Google Analytics in Chapter 13.
Tools Beyond AdSense for Tracking | 273

Action Items
If you are enrolled in the AdSense program, you should:
• Track progress by regularly displaying reports—perhaps as often as daily—to
monitor your AdSense for Content and Search performance as well as AdSense for
Domains
• Use custom reports or URL channels to display results to get a better handle on
performance on different parts of your site or site(s)
• Download CSV files to crunch your own data
• Use the optimization tips provided to increase your AdSense revenue
• Check the Site Diagnostics page and fix any problems indicated
• Learn to use the web traffic analysis programs available to you to get a better un-
derstanding of how your site is performing in relation to the AdSense program
• If your business justifies the trouble (and expense), consider more robust web
analytic software
• Make sure you link your Google Analytics and Google AdSense accounts

PART III
Working with AdWords


CHAPTER 10
Using AdWords
Google’s AdWords program is a marvelous way for big and small advertisers to reach
precisely the people they would like to reach. Ads placed via AdWords are almost
always relevant to people viewing the ads; they are targeted using keywords selected
by the advertiser and placed either on Google search results pages where users have
searched for these keywords (AdWords search network) or on web pages that publish
content including the targeted keywords (AdWords content network). In addition, it’s
estimated that ads placed using AdWords reach more than 80 percent of all Internet
users.
Unlike old-fashioned advertising, the AdWords delivery mechanism is managed com-
pletely via the Web and can be used by anyone who has a credit card. There’s not even
a minimum budget. You can design effective AdWords campaigns that drive traffic to
your site for just pennies a day; of course, it always helps to have a bigger budget!
This chapter explains how to open an AdWords account and how to create ad cam-
paigns, ad groups, and text or display keyword-targeted ads. Although the mechanics
of the AdWords program can appear a little daunting at first, after reading this chapter
you’ll be armed with the information you need to create sophisticated and cost-effective
targeted web ads.
Signing Up for an Account
To create an AdWords account, start by opening the Google AdWords home page at
http://adwords.google.com. Open an account using the Click to Begin button under the
Sign Up Now headline (Figure 10-1).
Creating Your Account
The new interface starts with you selecting the username and password that you would
like to use with AdWords. If you already have a Google account (for example, with
277

AdSense or Gmail), you can use that account to create your AdWords account and log
in to AdWords.
Some people prefer to use a new login and password just for AdWords and Google
(Figure 10-2).
Figure 10-2. To begin creating your AdWords account, choose a username and password
Figure 10-1. Google makes it very easy to sign up for AdWords
278 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

The next step is to set up the economics of your new ad. As shown in Figure 10-3, you’ll
need to:
• Select time zone country or territory
• Select time zone
• Choose a currency to pay for your new account
You need to ensure the time zone is relevant for your reporting in Ad-
Words, as this time zone data is also imported into the Google Analytics
reports. The currency or time zone settings cannot be changed after you
set up your account.
Figure 10-3. Set time zone and currency preferences
Working Backward
As you’ll see, although Google makes it pretty easy to sign up for an AdWords account,
the whole process can seem a little backward: you go through the steps to select your
budget, create an initial ad, select keywords to match your ads to potential customers,
and finally—at the end of the process—before your ad is run, you provide your credit
card information.
If you are like me, it would probably feel more natural to do this in reverse order: first
establish an account with your credit card so you are able to understand the various
account options, and then set up your first ad. Alas, that’s not an option, so to open
an AdWords account you must work backward.
Signing Up for an Account | 279

The final step in the signup process is verifying your account via an activation email.
After that, you will be able to sign in to your AdWords account using the email address
and password you specified. When you sign in, you will be asked to create your first
campaign (Figure 10-4) and enter your billing information to start running your ads.
Figure 10-4. First steps in creating your first campaign
Creating Your First Campaign
First, in the “Locations, languages, and demographics” window (Figure 10-5), choose
where you want your ads shown. Google tries to present you with good choices based
on what it knows about where you are located (e.g., where the computer you are work-
ing on is located). You can always override Google’s suggestions, but it does make sense
to carefully select only the area your business serves.
Figure 10-5. You can target customers in areas that Google hasn’t preselected
280 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

For quite a few businesses, there are no geographic borders—in which
case it makes sense to pick a wide geographic swath.
The initial choices Google offers include:
• Country
• Specific region, such as a state
• Localities, such as a city
You can change the country Google has preselected for you using the “Select a different
country or territory” link. You can also choose different areas within a country by
clicking the appropriate link and entering a city, region, or postal code, as shown in
Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-6. Select a location or multiple locations for targeting
Signing Up for an Account | 281

You can choose a language for your ad from the long list of available
languages that opens when you select Another Language in the “Loca-
tions, languages, and demographics” window. You target multiple lan-
guages by selecting the relevant boxes from the list, but AdWords does
not translate your ads to these languages.
The new interface allows some advanced settings as part of the standard campaign
setup, which includes demographic bidding preferences on eligible content network
sites. The next setting requires you to decide whether you want your ads for the initial
campaign to show up on both the search and content network (Figure 10-7). AdWords
recommends new advertisers select all available sites and devices, including iPhones
and mobile devices, to reach the greatest potential audience.
Figure 10-7. Select what networks and devices to target
Bidding and Budget
The new interface requires initial bidding and budget decisions to be made before the
selection of keywords or creation of the ads. There are two options for bidding: basic
and advanced. Most users will find that the basic option with both optional automatic
bidding and a focus on clicks will be suitable for their campaigns (see Figure 10-8).
If you select the automatic bidding option, you are unable to use posi-
tion preference or accelerated delivery of ads.
The Advanced option is more suitable once the campaign has been set up, because you
need to set up conversion tracking before you can use the Conversion Optimizer to
282 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

focus on conversions. If you want to focus on impressions, conversion optimization is
available only for content placement campaigns, not for those that are also running on
the search network.
The most important step in the setup of your campaign is setting your daily budget.
You can increase or decrease this budget at any time by editing campaign settings.
AdWords does not give any guidance at this stage as to a suitable budget based on the
keywords targeted in your campaign, but it does offer some help in the next step.
The campaign daily budget is averaged over the month, so actual daily
spending may vary.
Advanced Settings
One AdWords feature that most people should consider is Schedule, as it allows you
to set up multiple campaigns.
If you select to use the automatic bidding option, you cannot use said
scheduling.
Figure 10-8. The new interface allows for basic or advanced options
Signing Up for an Account | 283

Frequency capping is useful for controlling budgets for CPM campaigns, so it is avail-
able only for campaigns running on the content placement network. This option allows
for basic “per day” or “per ad group” settings. See Figure 10-9.
Figure 10-9. Ad scheduling allows for more flexibility when targeting specific customer markets
Creating an Ad
The next step is to create an actual ad using the window shown in Figure 10-10. First,
specify the ad that will direct traffic to the website; you can create more ads later.
As you can see in Figure 10-10, an ad consists of the following elements:
The Headline
A Headline appears at the top of your ad and is a hyperlink. When the user clicks
the link, she is redirected to the address you specify in the destination URL (speci-
fied in “What site will your ad link to?”). With the Headline, you have 25 characters
to capture the eye of a prospect.
Two Description lines
Each Description line is limited to 35 characters. The Descriptions are the heart of
your ad. Once an ad’s Headline has captured the attention of a prospect, it is up
to the Description to provide enough specific information to motivate the prospect
to click the hyperlink provided by the ad. It’s therefore important to think through
how best to achieve this goal using the 70 characters available (which is not much)
in the two Description lines.
284 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

The Display URL
The Display URL is the address that shows in the displayed ad, not necessarily the
one the ad links to.
The Destination URL
This is the actual address that the hyperlink associated with the Headline element
of the ad sends traffic to.
Figure 10-10. Google AdWords are terse, so make sure that every word counts
When a user clicks the hyperlinked Headline on your ad, an address on one of the
Google ad servers is opened. The Google ad server then automatically redirects the user
to the address you specified in the Destination URL field when you created the ad. This
allows Google to meter the click throughs on your ad, so Google can assign you, the
advertiser, a CPC-based charge and pay an AdSense CPC-based fee to the website on
which your clicked ad appeared, as applicable.
Providing the ability for you to use distinct display and actual (destination) URLs also
gives you some flexibility when you create your ads, particularly when you graduate to
the Standard Edition and can run multiple ads. For example, you can use this capability
to display a single, simple URL for your site while directing click throughs on different
versions of your ad to different internal portions of your site.
Bear in mind that as soon as you enter your billing information, your
account is activated, your ad will start running, and you will be charged
for it.
Of course, the mechanics of creating an ad are not nearly as important as understanding
how to craft an ad that will get people’s attention and make them want to click your
link and buy your goods or services, and, at the same time, not violate Google’s editorial
policies. (For more on Google’s policies, see the sidebar “Google’s Editorial and Con-
tent Guidelines” on page 287.)
Signing Up for an Account | 285

Generally, you should realize that AdWords ads are very short. As noted, when you
create an AdWords ad, you have 130 characters, including spaces and the display URL.
These characters are divided as shown in Table 10-1. This terseness leads to a style that
is possibly unique to AdWords CPC advertising, and may account for some of the
success of the medium: there’s little room for hype, and you must get to the point.

Crafting an Ad
If you stop to think about it, these four lines, with their rigid maximum number of
characters, present a writing challenge a bit like that involved in writing a formal haiku
(a Japanese poetic form with three lines and a specific, limited syllable count for each
line). For example:
Fancy headline leads
Describe, interest, compel
My hyperlink: yes!
Since the fourth line is used for the display URL, your ad really has only
the 25-character headline and the 70 characters of text. This compares
with the Japanese haiku convention of 5-7-5 syllables in three lines!
You’ll want to abbreviate and be as succinct as possible, while still being intelligible
and inviting. The best AdWords ads don’t bang surfers on the head; rather, they appear
to provide a solid and calm way to get information or services needed by the reader of
the ad (who, after all, has already been prequalified by ad targeting). Good AdWords
ads are pared down to the essentials.
The following guidelines are also basic to crafting good AdWords copy:
• Try to include the keywords you targeted with the text of the ad.
• Short, clear, nonrepetitive phrases work best.
• Make sure the words in your ad are all spelled correctly.
• Identify your unique selling proposition (what makes your site special?). Refer to
Chapter 2 for ideas about creating short pitches that identify your value
proposition.
286 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

• Provide a call to action using words such as “Buy,” “Shop,” or “Join” (e.g., “Join
our photo club!”).
For example, the ad:
Shop Wi-Fi Antennas
Large selection, good prices
Immediate shipping
will probably generate a respectable CTR if properly targeted. The ad is clear, simple,
and informative and contains a call to action.
In contrast, the following ad for the same merchandise is poorly written and contains
too much jargon (although perfectly acceptable under Google’s editorial guidelines).
Most prospects will probably be unclear about what the ad is selling and what benefits
clicking the link will provide:
Wireless Boosters Blog
IEEE 802 standard devices
Rectify and amplify
Google’s Editorial and Content Guidelines
AdWords Editorial Guidelines are essentially in your interest as an advertiser. For the
most part, these rules make sense. But working with Google’s Editorial Guidelines can
sometimes feel like working with a particularly rigid and unimaginative high school
English teacher—yes, spelling and punctuation do count. You’ll find the complete ed-
itorial, content, and linking guidelines at https://adwords.google.com/select/guidelines
.html.
Google enforces its rules with an automated check of your ad before it is accepted. In
fairness, Google’s rules are generally intended to make everybody’s web experience
better on the (probably true) premise that respect for web visitors on the part of ad-
vertisers yields better ad results.
The good news is that in some cases—for example, if Google believes you have mis-
spelled a word when in fact you are spelling the word differently as part of your
branding—you can request a waiver as part of the approval process. This waiver is
automatically granted pending Google’s manual review of the matter.
Here are some of the highlights of Google’s editorial strictures:
• Use proper spelling and grammar.
• Ad content and keywords must directly relate to the destination web page.
• Local services must indicate their location in their ads.
• No exclamation points in the ad headline and only one in the ad text.
• No unnecessary capitalization or repetition.
• No use of superlatives such as “best price” without third-party verification on your
site. This means real verification, and customer testimonials do not count.
Signing Up for an Account | 287

Google’s example: “If an ad claims to be the ‘Best of the Web,’ the site must display
third-party verification of the claim. A Forbes magazine seal indicating a site
received a ‘best of the web’ award would be acceptable, and the ad would then
comply with this policy.”
• No universal call-to-action phrases (such as “click here”) that could apply to any
site (but site-specific calls to action are generally encouraged).
• The third line of text cannot reference the display URL immediately below it.
Google also enforces an extensive list of content prohibitions, such as no ads promoting
prostitution. Note that some of these “sin” prohibitions depend on where your ad will
run; Google makes every effort to comply with applicable laws, and the legality of ads
for products such as alcohol do vary depending upon jurisdiction.
Choosing Keywords
The next step is to choose an initial 10 to 20 keywords or phrases that you will be
running your ad against, using the window shown in Figure 10-11. The keywords or
phrases you select will determine which search results pages your ad appears on. Users
will see the ad when they search for the keyword or phrase in Google. If you’ve elected
to display your ad on the Google AdSense network as well, your keywords are
used by Google to determine relevancy for placement purposes. (See “Ad
Groups” on page 308 for information about targeting Google search, content, or both
with an ad.)
The easiest way to add keywords is to expand one of the categories that Google suggests
based on a scan of your site (as shown in Figure 10-11), and add some of the specific
keywords suggested. The keywords or phrases you choose will also partially determine
the cost of your ad (if the keywords cost more than your budget, then your ad won’t
run), as well as its quality score. To make the process easier, the new interface offers a
simplified estimated traffic summary to help you understand more about approximate
campaign costs.
If you already have a list of specific websites on which you wish to place your ads, the
new interface saves you time by allowing you to add managed placements through a
simple text box. Later in this chapter we examine in more detail the new layout for
managed placements, which are now supported by an enhanced placement tool.
Generally, the best advice about keywords is to be targeted and specific
(don’t go after the kitchen sink), don’t use too many keywords (Google
suggests no more than 20, but less than 6 would probably be a good
starting place), and experiment. See “Keyword Tool” on page 331 for
some nifty assistance with keyword selection.
288 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

Providing Payment Information and Activating Your Account
Your ad isn’t served until you provide payment information to activate your account.
To activate your account, open the My Account tab and click the Billing Preferences
link.
In the Account Setup window, select the country in which your business is located, set
your local time zone, and click Continue. The choice in country or territory will affect
the payment options available, and might include region-specific options such as Bank
Transfer or BPAY. The “Choose form of payment” window, shown in Figure 10-12,
will open. You can choose to directly debit from a bank account or use a credit or debit
card. With credit card or debit card payments, you can choose to establish a prepaid
balance (as a way to control potential costs), or you can “postpay” as you go—meaning
as you receive clicks, your card is automatically charged.
Figure 10-11. Google suggests categories of keywords to make your selection easier
Signing Up for an Account | 289

Figure 10-12. You can choose from a number of campaign options
Once you select postpay or prepaid, you cannot change this. If you
change your mind, you will have to close down the account and open a
completely new account. Be careful and think about how you will be
managing your campaign over time, not just today, before you make
this choice.
Next, the Terms window will open. Review the AdWords terms and conditions, agree
to them, and click Continue. Finally, enter your billing and credit card (or bank)
information to complete the process.
Graduating
Previously, AdWords offered a separate Standard and Starter Edition for advertisers,
but with the development of the new interface, Google is updating all AdWords Starter
Edition accounts to the new interface. This means one interface can be used by all
advertisers. You no longer need to graduate to Standard Edition to expand your
account, and you now have access to all the advanced AdWords features available if
you want to use them.
The following are some of the key differences Starter Edition users will notice after the
update:
290 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

• Just one edition for everyone
• Able to advertise many more products (the old Starter Edition limited the account
size)
• Multiple ad formats
• Multiple geographic targeting
• Daily, not monthly, budget
• Advanced cost control with “automatic bidding”
• New settings tab
• New content networks tab
• Single Health Meter for your entire account
• Ability to create advanced reports
• Advanced campaign planning tools
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups
Ads are grouped within ad groups, and ad groups are contained within ad campaigns.
Each AdWords account can have many campaigns, and each campaign can contain
multiple ads. Google AdWords allows up to 25 campaigns in each AdWords account,
with up to 2,000 ad groups in each campaign, but many accounts are set up with a
single campaign and several ad groups. The relationship of an AdWords account to
campaigns and groups is shown in Figure 10-13.
Figure 10-13. An AdWords account can contain multiple campaigns, each of which can hold more
than one ad group
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 291

An ad group can have the same name as the ad campaign that contains
it.
You can use ad campaigns to contain the AdWords activity of a business unit or loca-
tion, or you can establish separate ad campaigns for projects with individual budgets
or unique settings.
Creating and Editing Ad Campaigns
When you create and activate an AdWords account, you must create an ad campaign
and an ad group as part of the account creation process.
However you get there, you will have at least one ad group within one ad campaign as
you get started with AdWords. Once your account is in use, it is likely that it will contain
multiple ad campaigns. Many of these ad campaigns will contain multiple ad groups.
For example, if you are a webmaster attempting to generate traffic to multiple sites, it
makes sense to create an ad campaign for each of your sites. Within each ad campaign
for one of your particular web properties, create an ad group containing a specific ad,
along with the keywords it targets.
Ad campaigns allow you to organize your AdWords account along functional lines, by
creating a separate ad campaign for each website, for instance. Within each ad cam-
paign, multiple ad groups—one per ad—allow you to experiment with how ads are
written and which keywords they target.
For example, a webmaster might have campaigns defined for a photography site and a
wireless networking site. Each campaign would probably contain several different ad
groups, with each ad group containing a different ad and targeted at somewhat different
keywords.
When you log on to AdWords, the first thing you will see is either the Account Snap-
shot, which provides an account overview, or the Campaign Summary window, which
will probably have multiple ad campaigns defined in the interface, as shown in Fig-
ure 10-14. The new interface uses a feature called “account tree” located on the left
side at all times. This feature makes it easier to navigate between your campaigns and
ad groups.
Some AdWords users prefer to set the Campaign Summary page as the
first page that opens, rather than the Account Snapshot page. You can
make this change by clicking the link on the bottom of either the
Campaign Summary or Account Snapshot pages.
292 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

If you created a new AdWords account, the campaign you created as part of the account
creation process was named Campaign #1. If you “graduated” from a Starter Edition
account, your campaign was named Starter by default.
Once your AdWords account is activated, you’ll want to change this name to something
recognizable by checking the box next to the campaign name and clicking Edit Settings.
Ad campaign names should let you know at a glance what the campaign is about.
Creating a New Campaign
To create a new AdWords campaign, from the Campaign Summary window, click
“+ New campaign” (shown in the left of Figure 10-14 below the graph box).
You shouldn’t have any trouble locating the Campaign Summary win-
dow; if it is not set to open first in your AdWords account, simply click
the Campaign Summary link from the Campaign Management tab.
Campaigns can be targeted either to specific ad placements on sites you designate or
to keywords. If you choose to create a keyword-targeted site, you’ll find that things
work almost identically to the campaign creation process you followed when you cre-
ated your first account, except that you can name your new ad campaign (and the initial
group within it) anything you like, as shown in Figure 10-15.
Figure 10-14. It’s common to define multiple ad campaigns within your AdWords account
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 293

Figure 10-15. It’s good to name new campaigns so that you can identify the purpose of the campaign
at a glance
Since I’ve already shown you how to create a keyword-targeted cam-
paign, this walk-through will feature a placement campaign. Keyword
targeting works as explained earlier in “Crafting an Ad” on page 286.
What Does Placement Targeting Mean?
Placement targeting, or site targeting, means specifying sites by domain for your ads,
rather than using keyword targeting. Each ad campaign can implement either keyword
targeting or site targeting.
In other words, once you’ve turned on site targeting globally, you can then elect to use
site targeting in a specific campaign (but not keyword targeting for the same campaign).
Site targeting often means using Google as an agent for CPM, rather than CPC, adver-
tising. As explained in Chapter 6, with CPM you pay for impressions, not for click
throughs.
Note that site-targeted ads appear only on Google’s content network and not on Google
search results pages.
294 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

By site targeting your ads, typically you are saying that you don’t really care about click
throughs and the primary purpose of your ad is to promote brand awareness rather
than a specific action on the part of those seeing your ads.
The new interface allows you to load campaign settings from an existing campaign,
which can speed up the process of creating similar campaigns by importing all previous
selections.
Just as when you signed up for an account, you must create an ad group
as part of the process of creating an ad campaign.
Whether you are placement targeting or keyword targeting, the next step is to write
your ad, as shown in Figure 10-16. (See “Crafting an Ad” on page 286 for tips about
how to write great AdWords ads.)
Figure 10-16. Before you target an ad, you need to write the ad copy
Review your ad, and add other ads to this ad group if you’d like. When you are satisfied
with your ad, click Continue to save. See Figure 10-17.
The new interface offers only limited support for content placement when creating a
new ad group because the settings for content placement have moved to the Networks
tab, where you can find the Placement Tool. (More detailed settings are available after
you’ve created the campaign.) As you can see in Figure 10-18, Google provides a num-
ber of ways you can find sites you want to target for placement. These methods include:
• A taxonomy of categories through which you can drill down
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 295

• A keyword search through site topics
• A straight list of available URLs
• A demographic search using the characteristics of the audience you are attempting
to target
Figure 10-18. The current Placement Tool offers a number of ways to identify the sites you want to
target for placement
The new beta “Find placements” tool (Figure 10-19) allows you to search based on
keywords or by website, with further refinements available, such as locations and lan-
guages. These refinements offer far more specific placement than the current Placement
Tool does. The “Filter placements” function offers some very specific refinements,
similar to Google Ad Planner, that try to ensure you reach the best possible audience
for your ads. The “Sorted by” options for the placement ideas, while advanced, still
Figure 10-17. You can quickly enter placements and set default ad group bids
296 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

seem to require more explanation, and the daily impression figures have varied ranges
and do not appear to be accurate enough for any use beyond general guidance.
Site Placement Considerations
The easiest approach (although not always the most effective way to go about site
targeting) is to pick an upper-level category from the site taxonomy and let Google
suggest specific placements. However, it’s work taking the time to review any sites you
don’t know well to make sure they’re really appropriate for your site targeting. Since
the primary purpose of CPM advertising—and site targeting is a form of CPM adver-
tising—is promoting brand awareness, you should be careful about the context sur-
rounding your ad (meaning the pages on which the ads appear). For example, it
wouldn’t do at all to have an ad for a prestigious car appear on a sleazy site.
Once you’ve identified your placements, you can refine the bid rates that you set when
creating the ad group. When you set up the campaign, you selected whether to pay for
the ads with CPC or CPM, and bid rates defaulted to the initial selection.
Figure 10-19. The new beta “Find placements” tool offers some vast improvements
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 297

CPC is best if you care most about driving traffic to your site; CPM is
best if you care more about getting users to view your ad and logo than
getting them to take a specific action. Video and image ads should al-
most always be placed on a CPM basis. Note that CPM ads appear only
on the Google content network, and not on Google search results pages.
It’s often best to choose CPC for the Google content network because
you can get a very high number of impressions with a very low CTR.
Depending on your campaign goals, this can result in an extremely low-
cost ad campaign.
Next, set a budget for the placement. As you can see in Figure 10-20, Google gives you
an estimate of the total number of daily impressions available for the sites in the place-
ment tool. These are the total number of impressions available to all advertisers, not
just to you.
You should usually choose at least five sites for placements.
Figure 10-20. The maximum CPM you enter amounts to a bid for placement on a site; your ad will
appear if this bid makes it worthwhile for the site operator compared to CPC ads and other CPM bids
Once you’ve reviewed the number of impressions available for your placement choices,
for CPM advertising you set an average daily budget and a maximum you are willing
to pay per a thousand impressions for each managed placement.
298 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

Keep in mind you are making a bid. It is not a guarantee that your ad
will appear on the placement-targeted site. The average-position col-
umn will help you understand whether your ads have a high enough
placement and whether you are bidding enough for your ad to run.
At this point, you can create another ad group for this site-targeted ad campaign, or if
you don’t want to make another ad group, your campaign is now ready and it will
appear in your account summary of all online campaigns and under the Networks tab
(for example, the bottom campaign shown in Figure 10-20). If you have set the bids to
CPC, you can see both content and search ad groups together (Figure 10-21), but if
you select CPM, you will have to set up a different CPC campaign for search.
Figure 10-21. The new site-targeted campaign appears in your account summary right along with
more traditional Google CPC campaigns
Editing Campaign Settings
You’ll often want to change the settings for one of your existing ad campaigns for a
whole host of reasons, including:
• You want to temporarily pause, resume, or permanently delete an ad campaign.
• You’d like to change the budget for a campaign.
• You’d like to access certain settings that cannot be changed from the default when
the ad campaign is created.
Pausing, resuming, and deleting an ad campaign
Proactive advertising managers often find themselves temporarily stopping (pausing)
an ad campaign. Pausing each of several campaigns in turn is a good way to see which
of them works best. After your comparison is complete, you can resume the most ef-
fective ad campaign. You may also want to delete an ad campaign if you no longer have
any interest in it.
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 299

Another reason for pausing an ad campaign is that your budget may
have temporarily run dry.
To pause, enable, or delete an ad campaign, check the box in the Campaign Summary
window next to the campaign to select it (the campaign Digital Era is shown selected
in Figure 10-22). Next, click Pause, Enable, or Delete as desired.
Figure 10-22. Webmasters often find they are pausing and resuming campaigns to meet the needs of
their budget, and this window makes it easy to perform the operation on multiple campaigns at once
You can select more than one campaign and perform an operation on all of the selected
campaigns at once using the checkboxes as shown in Figure 10-23.
Figure 10-23. Clicking “Change status” with one or more campaigns selected lets you change settings
for all selected campaigns
The Campaign Summary
There’s more to ad campaigns than whether they are running—in fact, much more! To
start editing campaign settings, click the Ad Campaign link in the Campaign Summary
window. A window like the one shown in Figure 10-24 will open, providing access to
a campaign’s ad groups.
300 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

Figure 10-24. The Campaign Summary window lets you review information about all the campaigns
The new interface summary window shows the campaign information in accessible
tabs, displaying Ad Groups (see “Ad Groups” on page 308), Ads, and Keywords. You
can also use this summary window to change settings for the entire ad campaign.
Excluding sites or categories
Excluding a website means making sure that your ads do not appear on that site. For
example, you might wish to exclude specific websites for an entire campaign because
you don’t want your ads to appear on a competitor’s site. Or you may have seen a site
that is contextually relevant but doesn’t provide a good environment for your ads.
Painting with a broader brush, you also can elect to exclude entire categories of sites.
Whatever your reasoning, it’s easy to exclude specific domains or site categories. You
can open the Site and Category Exclusion window, shown in Figure 10-25, by clicking
the “More tools…” link under the Opportunities tab (shown later in Figure 10-41).
If you have already excluded sites, instead of the Add link shown in
Figure 10-24, the link for excluding sites will say Edit.
To exclude a domain, subdomain, or directory within a domain, add it to the text box
shown in Figure 10-25, and then click “Save all changes.”
You can exclude what Google calls topics by going to the Topics tab, shown in Fig-
ure 10-26. Check the items you want to exclude and save your changes.
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 301

It’s usually best to exclude violent and edgy content so that your ads
won’t be shown on such pages.
You may be interested to know that you can exclude many types of user-generated
content, such as the content often found on social networking sites and photo sharing
Figure 10-25. You can make sure your ads do not appear on specific domains using the Site and
Category Exclusion window
Figure 10-26. Many advertisers prefer not to have their ads run on web pages featuring the kind of
content that you can exclude on the Topics tab
302 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

sites, on the Page Types tab, shown in Figure 10-27. You can also keep your ads out of
online video content, and the units used to display video, on the Media Types tab.
You might be surprised to learn that CTR can be quite good for error
pages and parked domains because such content is often very suitable
for your ad or business—for example, when a domain has been
mistyped but is similar to a very relevant and popular domain.
Figure 10-27. It’s easy to exclude specific kinds of pages
Adding negative keywords
Negative keywords are used to make sure your ad doesn’t run on a content site with
the specified keyword. For example, if you are trying to drive traffic to a digital pho-
tography site by targeting keywords such as “photo,” you might want to add “film” as
a negative keyword to make sure your ads don’t run on sites that primarily cover older,
film-based photography. Negative keywords can be added at the ad group or ad cam-
paign level.
Negative keywords can offer a great deal of control over your ad place-
ments. For example, if you are running a linen cleaning service just for
Brooklyn, you might add other locations in the New York area as neg-
ative keywords.
To add a negative keyword to an ad campaign in the new interface, go to the summary
screen for the campaign, scroll down the page, and expand the “+ Negative Keywords”
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 303

option. Click the Add button, enter your negative keywords, and then click Save. If
you’ve already added negative keywords to the campaign, you can edit their match
type, as shown in Figure 10-28.
Figure 10-28. Using negative keywords is a good way to make sure that ads don’t end up targeted to
inappropriate content
You can access the old Edit Campaign Negative Keywords tool in the new interface via
the “More tools…” link under the Opportunities tab. In the Edit Campaign Negative
Keywords window (Figure 10-29), add words you want to negatively target in the “Enter
words manually…” text box and click Add Keywords.
The Run Clean Sweep option, shown on the lower right of Fig-
ure 10-29, is a mechanism that lets you aggregate negative keywords
applied to individual ad groups within an ad campaign, up to the ad
campaign level.
Changing campaign settings
To edit ad campaign settings themselves, click the Edit Campaign Settings link in the
Campaign Summary window. The Edit Campaign Settings window is partially shown
in Figure 10-30. You can also open the Edit Campaign Settings window directly from
the Campaign Summary window by selecting the Settings tab.
Most of the settings you can edit with the Edit Campaign Settings window are exactly
the same as the settings offered when creating a new ad campaign. However, there are
304 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

some important settings that you can access from the Edit Campaign Settings window
that you cannot configure when setting up a new campaign, such as “Ad rotation.”
Optimizing ad service
By default, the “Optimize: Show better performing ads more often” button shown
under “Ad rotation” in Figure 10-31 is turned on. This means that AdWords will give
priority in ad placement to your keywords that are performing well (meaning a better
CTR). The logic here is that since these keywords are performing better than your other
keywords, they will probably continue to do so.
However, there are a couple of reasons you might want to experiment with turning this
option off. You might want to give your underperforming keywords a chance by serving
ads against them in equal proportion with the better-performing keywords (after all, if
the underperforming keywords never get to serve ads, they have no way to better their
performance).
You might also intentionally choose to target ads to keywords that don’t
perform so well if you are primarily interested in getting your ad text
noticed and less concerned about actual click throughs.
By unchecking this option, all your keywords will be served equally, not just your high-
performing keywords. Note that this might lower your average position and result in
fewer clicks.
Figure 10-29. Campaign Negative Keywords tool
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 305

Ad scheduling
For certain advertisers, it might make sense to turn on ad scheduling rather than run
ads all the time (Figure 10-32). For example, a service aimed at night owls that delivers
calming tea probably should not run during the day. Or you might want to run your
ads only during office hours, when there is someone available to answer the phone.
Figure 10-30. The Edit Campaign Settings window is used to change many campaign settings,
including whether ads appear on search results, on content, or both
306 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

Where ads display
All AdWords ads are displayed on Google search results pages. By default, your ads
will also be displayed on the AdSense search and content networks (see Chapter 8 for
information about these programs).
In the “Networks, devices, and extensions” section shown in Figure 10-30, under “Let
me choose…”, uncheck the Search network if you don’t want your ads to appear on
AdSense search results pages, and uncheck the Content network if you don’t want your
Figure 10-31. By default, better-performing ads are shown more times than average ads; however,
some advertisers prefer to rotate ads evenly
Figure 10-32. Ad optimization by time scheduling
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 307

ads to appear in AdSense web content. You can also choose whether you want ads
appearing on AdSense for Search pages (as opposed to regular Google search pages),
and whether you want your ads to appear on mobile devices such as iPhones.
Ads that appear in search results have a much higher CTR than ads
appearing in web content, so much so that Google itself doesn’t count
ads placed in content toward official CTR (although, of course, clicks
on these ads do cost you money).
Position preference and delivery method
These two advanced features are not used by most AdWords advertisers but can be
useful as extra ad optimization features for your campaigns. Position preference allows
AdWords to automatically manage maximum CPC bids to maintain a preferred posi-
tion range. The standard option for ad delivery is suitable for most accounts because
it ensures your budget stretches further, as the accelerated delivery may mean your
campaign will miss traffic later in the day. See Figure 10-33.
Figure 10-33. Advanced bidding and budget optimization
Ad Groups
The most granular level within the AdWords program is the ad group, which lets you
create individual ads and target the ads against keywords. You can easily add new ad
groups to existing campaigns.
Creating a new ad group
Each ad group must be created from within an ad campaign. To create an ad group,
start from the Campaign Summary window that will contain it (such as the Campaign
Summary window shown earlier in Figure 10-24).
Next, click the “+New ad group” link, and the “Create ad group” screen will display
(Figure 10-34). This process works the same way as entering your initial ad when you
first created your AdWords account (see “Creating an Ad” on page 284).
308 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

Figure 10-34. The “Create ad group” screen lets you write a new ad, provide keywords for targeting
(if it is a keyword-targeted ad), and set the maximum CPC for your ad
Editing an ad group
The new interface allows you to quickly edit an existing ad group by selecting the
checkbox and clicking Edit (Figure 10-35). If you require more options from the Cam-
paign Summary, click on the Ad Group link, and a screen like the one shown in Fig-
ure 10-36 will open.
Figure 10-35. Quickly edit within the new interface

Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 309

The new interface allows you to modify the text of an existing ad, as well as delete, edit,
add keywords, and adjust placements. To modify the text of the ad, open the Ads tab
shown in Figure 10-36.
Move your mouse over the ad you want to edit, and click on either the highlighted ad
or the pencil icon in the top-right corner. You can now change text and links, as shown
in Figure 10-37.
Figure 10-37. The new interface allows quick editing of both text and links in your ad
See Chapter 11 for information about how to make effective use of the keyword and
CPC metrics shown in the detailed Ad Group window and how to use the excellent
Keyword Tool. In addition to keyword, click-through, and CPC metric data, the de-
tailed Ad Group window gives you access to some functionality not available when you
first create an ad group; most important, you can create an ad with graphics, called an
image ad.
Creating an image ad
To create an image ad, go to the detailed Ad Group window and click the “New ad”
link (shown in Figure 10-38). The Image Ad creation window, shown in Fig-
ure 10-39, will open.
To create an image ad, click the Choose File button to upload a .gif, .jpg, or .png graphics
file from your computer that is sized appropriately (see Table 10-2) and has a file size
that is less than 50k.

Next, give the image a name, and verify the display and destination URLs. Click “Save
ad” to create the image ad.
The adjusted size column shown in Table 10-2 represents the actual size of the graphics
that Google will run in ads it serves. The “missing” 11 or 22 horizontal pixels are taken
up by your display URL and a Google feedback link.
It is best practice to resize your graphics yourself to the adjusted size. However, you
can alternatively check the box that authorizes Google to adjust your graphics from the
nominal size to the adjusted size.
Figure 10-38. Click the “Image ad” option to create an image ad
Figure 10-39. It’s easy to create image ads in a handful of acceptable sizes that will run with AdWords
Ad Campaigns and Ad Groups | 311

If you authorize Google to make this adjustment, be aware that the
resizing probably will not be proportional; watch the results carefully.
The Google AdWords editorial guidelines for image ads are nothing extraordinary, and
are about what you’d expect. Google takes its role in preventing users from being bom-
barded with offensive content—or ads that blink and gyrate—quite seriously. You can
see the full text of Google’s image ad policies at https://adwords.google.com/select/im
ageguidelines.html.
Google AdWords is not known primarily for serving image ads, and the majority of
AdWords ads are text ads. For one thing, image ads do not appear on Google search
results, and they appear in only some of the formats chosen by AdSense content par-
ticipants. Still, it’s an important facility to be able to serve targeted image ads via Ad-
Words, and you should know about it for those advertising situations in which you feel
a picture is worth many—specifically, 105—words.
Getting a My Client Center Account
A My Client Center (MCC) AdWords account is an umbrella account that allows you
to access as many as 1,000 different AdWords accounts using a single window (Fig-
ure 10-40).
Figure 10-40. If you are responsible for managing multiple AdWords accounts, it’s a great convenience
to be able to link all the AdWords accounts in a single client manager account
MCC accounts are primarily intended for advertising professionals who manage mul-
tiple AdWords accounts on behalf of clients. To sign up for a client manager account,
open the URL https://adwords.google.com/select/ProfessionalWelcome in your browser.
Next, click the “Join the Google Advertising Professionals program” link. The Enroll-
ment page will open.
In the Enrollment page, enter your existing Google account that you use for AdWords
logon information.
312 | Chapter 10: Using AdWords

Click Continue Enrollment. In the next window you provide a different (or new) Google
account for managing access to your My Client Center. The email address cannot be
the same as the one for your existing AdWords account.
An MCC account acts as a container for multiple AdWords accounts (just as each
AdWords client account is a container for ad campaigns, which in turn are containers
for ad groups). Besides making it easier to manage multiple AdWords accounts, client
manager accounts provide a number of other benefits, including the ability to enroll in
the Google Advertising Professional program (see the sidebar “Becoming a Google Ad-
vertising Professional” on page 313).
Note that if your AdWords account is managed as part of an MCC account, a client
manager will be listed on the Access page of the My Account tab (see Figure 10-41).
Figure 10-41. A Client Manager has an MCC account and access to this AdWords account
Becoming a Google Advertising Professional
Google Advertising Professionals is a program offering certifications, tools, training,
and incentives for those who manage multiple AdWords accounts (and numerous Ad-
Words campaigns) on behalf of multiple clients. It is intended for professional adver-
tising managers.
You can learn more about the program at the Google Advertising Professional’s wel
come page. In order to enroll in the program, you’ll need to first get a client manager
account.
The benefits to advertising professionals include:
• A professional certification program for members who pass an exam and are ac-
tively placing AdWords ads
• Professional visibility for members who are certified via a referral program
Getting a My Client Center Account | 313

• Promotional goodies—including advertising credits—to give away to advertising
clients
• Promotional materials that members can use to help sell potential clients on the
benefits of the AdWords program
Action Items

CHAPTER 11
Improving Performance
There’s a great deal of information contained in the average AdWords account. This
information—ads and keywords and the related performance data—is stashed away
in ad groups. These ad groups are themselves contained in AdWords campaigns.
To make effective use of AdWords, you need to be able to get to this information. In
other words, drilling down into one ad group after another will only provide piecemeal
data and usually won’t give you the kind of picture you need to improve performance.
For CPC ads, an ad group consists of the text of an ad and its targeted keywords, along
with budget choices. For CPM ads, an ad group consists of the creative for the ad or
its text, the targeted domains, and budget choices.
It’s pretty unlikely for an ad, or an ad campaign, to be perfect the first time round. A
great part of the craft of creating effective campaigns is to see how your ads and cam-
paigns are doing, tweak them, see how the improved ads and campaigns are doing,
tweak again, and iterate the process. In other words, if at first you don’t succeed, try
and try again.
This chapter explains how to monitor your AdWords campaigns and AdWords ad
groups performance, and how to use the tools that AdWords provides to improve ad
and campaign performance.
Monitoring Your AdWords Activity
When you open AdWords, the initial screen you’ll see is the Account Snapshot, parti-
ally shown in Figure 11-1. By glancing at the Account Snapshots window, you can see
whether there are any alerts or status messages that you need to pay attention to. You
can also set up a watch list for specific campaigns.
315

Figure 11-1. The Account Snapshot screen is a centralized place for you to see messages from the
system and watch specific campaigns
Of course, the most important thing is to keep frequent track of the progress of your
ads. The key high-level questions are:
• How much are you spending?
• How effective are your ads?
• How well are your keywords performing?
Two of the Account Status windows help you track your spending and ad effectiveness.
Keyword Performance shows you how well your best performing keywords are doing
at a glance (Figure 11-2).
You can change the time frame of reference in the Keyword Performance
applet, as is true of most of the AdWords performance review tools.
The Campaign Performance window, shown in Figure 11-3, provides both a visual and
metric overview of how all your campaigns are doing. You can set the graphics to display
a variety of different statistics, including cost, clicks, and impressions. You can elect to
display information for all your online campaigns or for a specific campaign (by clicking
the downward arrow shown in Figure 11-3 next to All Online Campaigns).
To really start to get to the underlying campaign and ad performance, you need to open
the AdWords Campaign Summary window (shown in Figure 11-4).
316 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Some AdWords users prefer to set the Campaign Summary page as the
first page that opens, rather than the Account Snapshot page. You can
make this change by clicking the link on the bottom of either the Cam-
paign Summary or Account Snapshot pages.
Understanding Your Campaign Summary
You can set the Campaign Summary window to display information for the current day
or for almost any date range after the beginning of your AdWords account. Preset time
periods besides the current day include the current week, the current month, and all
time (i.e., since you opened your AdWords account).
For the purpose of monitoring your AdWords performance, you should
check the current day’s activity at least once a day before reviewing other
time periods.
Figure 11-2. The Keyword Performance window will show you clicks, impressions, and CTR for your
best performing keywords
Monitoring Your AdWords Activity | 317

Here’s what the columns in the Campaign Summary window tell you about each of
your campaigns:
Current Status
Campaign status can be Active, Paused, or Deleted. If a campaign is Active, ad
groups within the campaign can be Paused. Paused campaigns are campaigns that
are not running, but can be reactivated and set to Active. The number of Paused
ad groups within a campaign will be displayed below the campaign’s status. De-
leted campaigns cannot be reactivated. The historical data about Deleted cam-
paigns is still present, so you can use this information for the purposes of analysis.
Figure 11-3. The Campaign Performance window provides an at-a-glance summary of how your
campaigns are doing
318 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Current Budget
This is the daily amount you’ve budgeted for each campaign.
Clicks
The aggregate number of times ads within a campaign have been clicked.
Impr.
The aggregate number of impressions, or times the ads within a campaign have
been displayed.
CTR
The click-through rate, or ratio of clicks to impressions, for a campaign.
Avg. CPC
The average cost per click for the ads in a campaign (for CPC-based ads).
Avg. CPM
The average cost per thousand impressions for CPM-based ads.
Cost
The total cost for all the ads in a campaign.
Conversion
Occurs when a click on your ad leads to an action, such as a purchase, signup, or
lead.
View-through Conversion
Occurs when no content ad is clicked, but a conversion occurs within 30 days.

for any time period

Drilling Down into a Campaign
To get more detailed information about a specific campaign, click the campaign in the
Campaign Summary window. A summary window opens, as in Figure 11-5, showing
each ad group within the campaign.
Figure 11-5. A summary of each ad group within the campaign is shown
Here’s the information shown for each ad group within a campaign (in each case for
the time period selected):
Status
Ad group status can be Active, Paused, or Deleted.
Max CPC
The maximum amount you are willing to pay for content ads and specific targeted
placements. (For CPM ads, this column is maximum CPM rather than CPC.) By
default, Max CPC is broken down into the amount you are willing to pay for con-
tent ads (as opposed to search ads, which would be priced at the default) and
specific, targeted placements.
Clicks
The aggregate number of times an ad has been clicked.
Impr.
The aggregate number of impressions, or times an ad has been displayed.
CTR
The click-through rate, or ratio of clicks to impressions, for a campaign.
Avg. CPC
The average cost per click for an ad (for CPC-based ads).
Avg. CPM
The average cost per thousand impressions for CPM-based ads.
320 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Cost
The cost of the ad.
Avg. Pos.
The average position at which your ad is likely to be displayed when there is a
keyword search match (see the sidebar “Understanding Average Position”).
For CPM ads, the Avg. Pos. column does not appear.
Understanding Average Position
Average position is an integer that is 1 or greater, usually followed by a decimal point
and a single integer after the decimal point (for example, 1.7).
Simply put, the closer your ad’s average position to 1.0, the more likely it is to appear
in search results. Ads with an average position between 1 and 8 will appear on the first
page of search results; those with an average position between 9 and 16 will appear on
the second page of search results; and so on.
The reason for the decimal number is that it is the calculation of an average estimate;
actual placement is not guaranteed and depends on many factors.
A conversion takes place when a sales prospect performs a specific action, such as
making a purchase.
Conversions—represented by the Conversion Rate, Cost per Conversions, and Num-
ber of Conversions columns in the Campaign Summary page—depend on how you
define a conversion. Conversion tracking is explained in Chapter 13.
Understanding Ad Group Performance
The real information about ad performance comes at the granular level of the ad group.
To see performance of an individual ad group, click on the ad group in the summary
for a particular campaign. A window will open displaying the ad contained by the ad
group and showing keyword statistics for the ad, like the one shown in Figure 11-6.
The statistics for an ad group are roughly similar to those presented for individual
campaigns and for the ad campaign summary, although the information is more gran-
ular (it applies to a specific group and not the entire campaign) and the relevant ad is
also displayed.
Another important difference between the Ad Group Performance window and the less
granular Campaign Summary performance window is that aggregate results are broken
out by search versus content network.
Monitoring Your AdWords Activity | 321

Search and content results
Statistics for a given ad are divided between search (ads appearing on Google search
results pages) and content (ads appearing on Google’s network of websites affiliated
via AdSense).
Google also contracts out its AdWords ads to appear on a number of
networks besides AdSense, including those provided by America On-
line, Amazon, Ask.com, and EarthLink, so there’s no telling exactly
where your ads may appear!
Search versus content statistics are significant because your ad may do better in one
context than the other. If you learn that this is happening, you may decide to run your
ad only in search or only in content.
It’s normal to expect much lower CTR on content ads than on Google
search results ads. This is so much the case that Google does not include
content results when calculating keyword status.
Figure 11-6. The summary window for each ad group provides a detailed account of individual ad
performance
322 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Individual keyword results
To really see what’s going on with your ad, you need to click the Keywords tab for a
view like the one shown in Figure 11-7.
The Keywords display breaks out results by individual keyword, and shows the status
of each keyword.
Figure 11-7. Understanding how individual keywords are performing is crucial to tweaking an
AdWords account
Properly understanding the statistics relating to the individual keywords associated
with your ads can help you target ads better and improve your ad performance.
Individual keyword results are important because they allow you to determine how
well your ads are being targeted. For most CPC advertisers, the ultimate goal of an
advertising campaign is customer conversion—that is, getting a site visitor to take an
affirmative step, such as joining a service or buying something. Clicking through is the
single most significant thing someone on the Web can do on the journey toward cus-
tomer conversion. If you don’t get click throughs, your ad campaign is not working, at
least if customer conversion is the goal. Conversions as a metric are discussed further
in Chapter 13.
Some ad campaigns don’t have customer conversion as their primary
goal. For these campaigns, creating brand awareness might be the main
purpose of an ad. Managers of these campaigns might be well advised
to choose CMP rather than CPC advertising. In any event, they will pay
less attention to CTR rates. They may also figure that CPC advertising
with no click throughs is a good deal, because there are no costs asso-
ciated with the advertising.
Assuming that your goals are like those of most advertisers on the Web—to drive traffic
to your site with the hope of converting traffic into paying customers—you should
monitor both absolute CTR and how your CTR are changing.
Monitoring Your AdWords Activity | 323

A CTR of 2 percent or better is good, although you should aim for a CTR of more than
5 percent.
By comparison, a direct mail campaign with a response rate of just 0.2
percent—an order of magnitude less than 2 percent—is considered
successful.
On the other hand, if your absolute CTR for an ad is less than 0.4 percent, you should
think about how to bring that rate up by using one or more of these strategies:
• Improving your ad so that it is more compelling
• Improving your keywords so they are more relevant to your ad and/or more
targeted
• Using negative keywords
• Testing multiple ads
• Increasing your bid amount so that you are shown higher in the results
• Reducing the number of ads you are targeting so that you can be more focused
In a similar spirit, an increasing CTR for a keyword is a good thing, but a decreasing
CTR is not, and the latter might mean that your ad has reached a saturation point for
a specific keyword. If this is happening, you should think about alternative keyword
targeting, starting with synonyms.
Quality Score
You should know that the AdWords system calculates a Quality Score for each of your
keywords. It looks at a variety of factors to measure how relevant your keyword is to
your ad text and to a user’s search query. Essentially, instead of maximizing its profits
in the short term by selling premium ad space to the highest bidder, Google regards
those who use the Google search engine as customers. In the long run, use of the Quality
Score is intended to improve the experience of these search customers so they keep
coming back.
A keyword’s Quality Score updates frequently and is closely related to its performance.
In general, a high Quality Score means that your keyword will trigger ads in a higher
position and at a lower cost per click. You can really save money and optimize your ad
placements at the same time by working to improve your Quality Score.
The Quality Score calculation is a somewhat complex business. A good place to learn
how to improve your Quality Score can be found on the bg Theory blog at http://www
.bgtheory.com/blog/google-adwords-quality-score-factors-demystified/.
324 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Keyword status
Google does not want ads to appear on its network that are targeted against keywords
that it expects to have a CTR of less than 0.5 percent. For this reason, Google evaluates
the keywords you’ve chosen for targeting based on their CTR with AdWords ads in
general and on the CTR of similar keywords.
Keyword status is based on ads appearing on Google search results
pages, not on ads appearing on content pages.
If one of your keywords falls below the minimum threshold in Google’s estimating
process, the keyword will be disabled, meaning your ad won’t be targeted to that key-
word. Glancing at the keyword status column in the statistics display for an ad is a good
way to quickly ensure that your keywords are performing acceptably.
The possible keyword status labels and their meanings are shown in Table 11-1.
Table 11-1. Keyword status labels and meanings
Keyword status label
Meaning
Normal
Targeted keywords are above Google’s minimum 0.5 percent CTR threshold; ads targeted to these
keywords should display normally.
In trial
Keywords are below the minimum CTR threshold and under evaluation. Ads targeted to these keywords
will continue to be served until Google is statistically confident that the keywords will deliver a CTR
above or below the minimum—when the keyword will be moved to Normal or Disabled status,
respectively. Each account has a limited (but unspecified) number of keywords that can be in trial at
any one time.
On hold
An account’s In trial limit has been exceeded and a keyword is slightly below the minimum threshold.
When In trial space becomes available, On hold keywords are automatically moved up to In trial status.
Disabled
Keywords don’t meet the minimum quality threshold (the 0.5 percent CTR) or haven’t triggered a click
through in 90 days. If you really think a Disabled keyword is relevant to your ad, you can try turning
the keyword into a descriptive phrase—for example, “yacht buying service” rather than “yacht.”
Campaign Management Tools
Google provides many tools to help you improve your campaigns and ads, and to
answer questions about performance. Although there are multiple routes to access
many of these tools, all of them can be opened from the Opportunities tab in the new
interface (shown in Figure 11-8) and via the Campaign Management Tools tab in older
accounts.
Campaign Management Tools | 325

Using the Ads Diagnostic Tool
Will my ad appear on a Google page that answers a specific search query? This is a
question of vital importance to an ad campaign manager who may care more about the
answer to this practical issue than about the theoretical improvement of keywords.
The Ads Diagnostic Tool is intended to answer this question by telling you which of
your ads are likely to appear on Google search results pages.
To open the Ads Diagnostic Tool, open the Opportunities tab, click the Tools link, and
then click “Ads diagnostic tool” (the link is shown on the lower left of Figure 11-8).
The Ads Diagnostic Tool, shown in Figure 11-9, will open.
The Ads Diagnostic Tool provides two different mechanisms: Option 1 and Option 2.
However, each one comes up with the same result, provided you use the same search
query with each option. (See “Entering Search Queries or Search Results Page
URLs” on page 328.)
What Decides Whether Your Ad Will Appear?
Keyword selection—and performance—plays a crucial role in determining whether
your ad will appear in response to a specific query, but so do other factors. For example,
if you’ve used up your budget for the day for an ad group, your ad will probably not
appear. (Note that this is not an absolute, because budgets are expressed as rolling
30-day averages; Google can overbudget on your behalf one day and make up for it on
another day.)
Additionally, if the maximum CPC you are willing to pay for a given ad is less than
other advertisers are willing to pay for ads targeted to the same keyword, it becomes
less likely that your ad will appear in response to a query for that keyword.
Figure 11-8. Discovery and enhancement of your ads is made easier using the tools Google provides
326 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

To use Option 1, enter a keyword or keyword phrase in the “Keyword selection” text
box, as shown in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-10. Enter a keyword or use the plus (+) operator or quotes (as in the figure) to enter a literal
multiword term
Figure 11-9. You can use the Ads Diagnostic Tool to see whether your ad is targeted to a keyword on
Google search results pages
Campaign Management Tools | 327

Entering Search Queries or Search Results Page URLs
Option 1 and Option 2, as shown in Figure 11-9, provide two different mechanisms
that use essentially the same inputs and show the same results. If the keyword phrase
you enter in the Option 1 box is the same as the search you used in Google prior to
copying and pasting it into the Option 2 box, then the results will be the same.
However, if the keyword phrase you enter in the Option 1 box contains multiple terms,
you must remember either to put plus symbols between the keywords or quote the
phrase. In contrast, Google search will take care of this for you automatically with
Option 2.
Next, click Continue. The Keyword Diagnosis results window will tell you whether the
ads in your account that are targeted to the keyword or keyword phrase you entered
are likely to run on Google search pages (Figure 11-11).
Figure 11-11. This new interface provides much more detailed explanations around why particular
keywords are not showing ads
328 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

The ads shown in Figure 11-11 fail to meet minimum CTR requirements for the key-
words under investigation. This means that they would be good candidates for keyword
improvement, using the tools explained in “Optimizing Your Ads” on page 330.
In addition, you can see whether a keyword is likely to be showing ads. If the ad will
be shown, results like those shown in Figure 11-12 will be displayed.
Figure 11-12. If you try a keyword that does meet threshold requirements, the ad targeted to the
keyword is displayed
The difference between the keywords targeted (and results shown) in
Figure 11-11 lies in the broadness and lack of specificity of the terms:
“digital photo blog” in Figure 11-11 versus the very precise and narrow
term “f-stop” (which refers to a photographic lens aperture). Narrow,
precise, and technical terms will almost always have higher CTR (al-
though these searches will not come up as often as searches for broader
terms). This is an important general trade-off to highlight: the more
narrow and specific the keywords, the better the targeting ability; how-
ever, there will be less overall traffic.
In some ways, the Ads Diagnostic Tool Option 2 may be more convenient and intuitive
than Option 1. You can search Google until your heart’s content (you may even see
your own ads as you search!).
When you locate a specific query that you want to find out about (or you want to verify
your empirical findings that your ad does or does not appear on search results pages),
copy the address for the Google search query from your browser’s address bar. Paste
the URL into the Search Results Page URL text box, shown in Figure 11-13.
Campaign Management Tools | 329

The results from this procedure are exactly the same as if you used the
query part of the Google search URL (the part in Figure 11-13 after the
q=night+photography) in Option 1.
Figure 11-13. You can alternatively search using a Google URL if you want to verify whether a
particular search page will (or will not) display your ad
The Ads Diagnostic Results will either tell you that your ad should display (Fig-
ure 11-14) or—if it won’t display—provide diagnostic messages like the one shown in
Figure 11-11.
Figure 11-14. Google shows you when your keyword and related ad shows because of geo-targeting
(as in this case) and also when your ad and keyword do not
Optimizing Your Ads
Once you’ve determined that there are specific ad groups that need improvement, either
by monitoring CTR statistics (because you are not getting a high enough CTR) or by
using the Ads Diagnostic Tool (because your ads are not showing against the search
terms you’d like), Google provides a number of tools you can use. It’s in your best
interest to try to improve your targeting because more focused matching means that
the most appropriate prospects see your ads, and consequently your cost, expressed as
CPC goes down.
Google provides a great many tools for optimizing yours ads. The most important are
the Keyword Tool, the Traffic Estimator, and the Campaign Optimizer, which—like
the Ads Diagnostic Tool—can be accessed via the Campaign Management Tools page.
330 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Keyword Tool
You can open the Keyword Tool in either of two ways:
• In the Tools panel under the Opportunities tab, click the Keyword Tool link
(shown on the left in Figure 11-8). When the Keyword Tool is opened this way, it
won’t have any keywords loaded, as shown in Figure 11-15, making this the best
option for figuring out the keywords for a new ad group rather than clarifying an
existing group.
• With the summary window for an ad group open, click the Keyword Tool link.
The Keyword Tool then opens in a new window, fully preloaded with the existing
keywords for the ad group, as shown in Figure 11-16.
Figure 11-15. You can open the Keyword Tool from the Tools panel to experiment with keywords
before you have specific keywords running against ad groups
Figure 11-16. When you open the Keyword Tool from an existing ad group, more specific, similar,
and additional keywords to the ones already targeted by the ad group are suggested
A goal of keyword optimization is to make sure that your ads will run according to the
Ads Diagnostic Tool. For example, consider the ads shown in Figure 11-11 that were
Campaign Management Tools | 331

not displayed in response to the search query “digital photo blog.” It makes sense to
use the Keyword Tool to get these ads performing better.
You can run the poorly performing keywords for the ads that failed the Ads Diagnostic
Tool through the Keyword Tool, as shown in Figure 11-17, to generate a long list of
alternative suggestions. The new and improved tool also offers some more advanced
options, which provide you with more accurate estimates and some useful filters for
more refined suggested results (Figure 11-18).
Although the Keyword Tool comes up with a very extensive list of pos-
sibilities, ultimately it is up to the human being who is managing the
AdWords campaign—possibly by dint of trial and error—to come up
with high-performing keywords.
Figure 11-17. Running failing keywords through the Keyword Tool is the best way to start coming
up with better alternatives

332 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Keyword Matching Options
AdWords offers a number of keyword matching options. Understanding these options
can help to improve the relevancy of your ad placement, leading to fewer ad impressions
but a higher CPC.
The keyword matching options are:
Broad match
This is the default option. When you enter a phrase such as sail boat, ads will
appear when a user’s query contains sail and boat in any order in any part of a
query, possibly along with other terms. In addition, broad-matched ads will also
show for expanded matches, which are matches with plural (or singular) and other
variant forms of the words in a phrase.
Phrase match
When you enter your keywords in quotes—for example, “sail boat”—your ad will
appear when a user enters the search phrase in the order it appears within the
quotes, but possibly with other words as well—for example, big sail boat.
Exact match
Exact matches are the least flexible kind of keyword matching. The term that users
search for must exactly match the phrase you enter in brackets—for example, [sail
boat]—in order, without any additional terms. Exact matching is the most targeted
option among experienced AdWords managers because users searching for terms
that make this kind of narrow match are more likely to be interested in exactly
your business’s offerings.
Negative keyword match
Negative keywords are added to a search phrase by placing a minus sign in front
of the negative keyword, to make a search more precisely targeted. For example,
if you target sail boat -blue, your ad will appear when a user searches for sail
boat, but not blue sail boat. Negative keywords are an important mechanism for
making targeting more precise.
The problem with the first ad shown as failing the Ads Diagnostic Tool in Fig-
ure 11-11 is a broad match with the phrase digital photography. Deleting “digital
photography” and replacing it with exact matches—[digital photography tips] and
[digital photography techniques]—improves the CTR for this ad.
The problem with the second ad shown in Figure 11-11 is the broad match targeting
with photo blog and photo blogging. The Keyword Tool makes lots of suggestions, but
most of them are not appropriate (for example, erotic photo blog or blogspot). Drop-
ping the keywords related to “blog” and focusing on keywords related to digital pho-
tography might improve CPC for this ad. However, that would actually diminish the
relevancy of the advertisement, which is attempting to drive traffic to a photo blog. The
recommendation here is to live with a low CTR and increase the likelihood of ad place-
ment on search results pages by increasing the maximum CPC you are willing to pay.
Campaign Management Tools | 333

Estimating traffic
The Traffic Estimator is best used to get a quick idea of how keywords will perform
and how that performance will affect the cost of running an ad group, without actually
adding the new keyword(s).
To open the Traffic Estimator, go to the Opportunities tab, click “More tools…”, and
click the Traffic Estimator link in the lefthand column.
In the Traffic Estimator window, shown in Figure 11-19, enter the keywords you want
to investigate, as well as a maximum CPC, language, location targeting method, and
countries to target.
Figure 11-19. You can enter the amount you are willing to pay for a click through or let Google suggest
a value, and Google will give you a traffic estimate for the keyword
334 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

If you don’t estimate a maximum CPC in the Traffic Estimator, Google
will suggest one for you that will deliver ads in the top (1.0) position 85
percent of the time. As you can imagine, this is an expensive CPC choice,
so to make the best use of the Traffic Estimator, you should always enter
your own, more realistic, maximum CPC.
Click Continue. The Traffic Estimator results screen, shown in Figure 11-20, gives you
an idea of the average position, clicks per day, and cost per day you can expect, given
the keywords you entered and the maximum CPC you specified.
Figure 11-20. You can use the estimates provided by the Traffic Estimator to decide whether you want
to add keywords to an ad group
Campaign Optimizer
The Campaign Optimizer takes an automated look at your campaign, ad, and keyword
settings and makes suggestions.
It bears repeating that you should use your judgment and discretion in
deciding whether to confirm the changes that the Campaign Optimizer
suggests. The Campaign Optimizer is not privy to many aspects of the
decision-making process in your specific situation. As the fine print in
the Campaign Optimizer itself notes, you alone are responsible for the
content of your ads.
To start the Campaign Optimizer, click the Campaign Optimizer link on the Tools page
(hidden within the Opportunities tab shown in Figure 11-8). Next, select a campaign
to optimize and click Go (Figure 11-21), and then click Get Started (Figure 11-22). The
Campaign Optimizer will come up with a list of location targeting options, as shown
in Figure 11-23.
Campaign Management Tools | 335

Figure 11-22. Campaign Optimizer: Getting Started
Figure 11-23. Campaign Optimizer: Location Targeting Options
336 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

Campaign Optimizer and Suggested Changes
The Campaign Optimizer suggests keywords to add when the system concludes that
you are underutilizing relevant keywords. Adding relevant keywords means bringing
more targeted traffic through your ads, but exercise some caution—this tool may not
always be so effective at determining relevance to your site and concerns.
The suggestion will be to delete keywords if the Optimizer finds they are performing
poorly, or if the analysis concludes they aren’t directly relevant to your ad.
Keyword matching options (see the earlier sidebar “Keyword Matching Op-
tions” on page 333) are important, because if the matches are too narrow you might
get too little traffic, and if they are too broad you might get too much general traffic.
The Optimizer will make suggestions to improve the efficiency of your matches.
In addition, the Optimizer will likely suggest making changes in your keyword bids to
improve your ad position by bidding higher, or (less likely) suggest you lower your bids
to free up ad budgets.
In the new interface (Figure 11-24), you begin by reviewing each ad group keyword
suggestion individually. Click review, and then check the Approve box beside the
changes you’d like to implement (Figure 11-25). You can also globally approve all
suggestions, but this is not advisable, unless you have reviewed each one carefully.
Figure 11-24. Campaign Optimizer: Ad Groups
Next, click the “Confirm changes” button, shown in Figure 11-26. Depending on the
analysis of the software, you may be asked to approve suggestions for changing the text
of the ads themselves.
Campaign Management Tools | 337

Figure 11-26. The Campaign Optimizer’s Step 2 of 3: Ad Variations
Suggested changes to the text of an ad are usually pretty straightforward,
along the lines of capitalizing the first letter of each word in a display
URL, and they work as described when you first create an ad (see Chap-
ter 10). Don’t expect human subtlety from these suggestions; rather,
they are useful as a checklist to make sure you haven’t overlooked
something basic.
Figure 11-25. The Campaign Optimizer’s Step 1 of 3: Keywords
338 | Chapter 11: Improving Performance

When you are satisfied with your keyword changes (and ad text changes, if any), click
“Apply and continue” as shown in Figure 11-27.
Figure 11-27. Click Apply and continue to save the changes made to your keywords
Google recommends that you run the Optimizer no more than once
every two weeks for a given campaign. Otherwise, the software won’t
be able to gather enough meaningful data to present good suggestions.

CHAPTER 12
The Zen of AdWords
Zen is about balance. A successful AdWords campaign is complex and involves a num-
ber of potentially competing considerations. Understanding the Zen of AdWords
means learning to balance these considerations.
Before you can begin to refine an AdWords campaign, you must understand the goal
of the campaign. Since AdWords is more compatible with formal ways to define success
and failure than conventional (pre-CPC) advertising, it is desirable to reduce the criteria
for a successful campaign to a standard metric. For example, the campaign is successful
on an individual basis if a visitor clicks on my site landing page. But it’s better to work
for conversions, which are really the point of most CPC ads.
Therefore, a campaign is successful if a visitor buys my product online (or by picking
up the phone to place an order after visiting my site).
In addition, you will need to determine the range of aggregate actions that constitute
success. If 100,000 people buy my book, it is a success. But if only 10 people buy the
same book, it is a failure. With your success metric in hand, it’s time to consider the
steps to AdWords success that need to be balanced.
The Customer Life Cycle
A good way to look at things is to remember the five-step process you want your
potential customers to take:
1. Your potential customer searches for something—for example, “digital
photography”
2. Your ad appears above or to the right of the search results (a slight variation is that
your ad might also appear next to content on a website as a result of the AdSense
program)
3. The customer reads your ad and clicks on it
4. The customer visits your site
341

5. The customer buys something, preferably online, but a purchase by phone isn’t
bad either
The desired end result of this process is the conversion.
Once you’ve dissected the process into those five steps, you need to consider the five
actions you should take to encourage the desired result. Balancing these five steps con-
stitutes the Zen of AdWords.
Keywords
The basis for your ad that the potential customer will see step 1 is the keywords you
choose. This means that picking the right keywords is critical to a successful AdWords
campaign. You need to pick the words that people who are receptive to buying your
product will be searching for. How can you find these words? The AdWords
Keyword Tool, explained in Chapter 11, gives you good ideas of popular words and
phrases you can consider.
More generally, you should consider the question, “What are people searching for on
the Web?”
In addition to the Keyword Tool, there are many sites on the Web (both
free and paid) that can help you generate keywords. While I’m not
endorsing any specific resource in this arena, some of these sites are
undoubtedly helpful. However, you should also strongly rely on your
own expertise regarding trade practices and keywords in the specific
market niches of the product area you are working with.
One simple thing to think about regarding keywords is that you should try different
modifiers and stems, e.g., “photo accessories” as well as “photo supplies.” If you are
promoting a local business, you should definitely include that in your keyword
phrases—for example, “Berkeley, California, chiropractor.”
Remember that you are trying to reach customers who are on their way to making a
purchasing decision. From this viewpoint, you want people interested in specific items
rather than those playing the field with research-oriented terms. As an example, “cam-
era review” indicates someone who is in the early stages of thinking about a purchase,
whereas a specific product search (“Nikon D300”) may indicate someone who is ready
to buy.
Another example: a search for “sports cars” probably indicates someone who is doing
research, while a search for a specific car model may come from someone who is closer
to actually buying.
There’s a reason that terms that indicate research are cheaper to bid for on AdWords
than specific product terms. That said, some businesses want to purchase both the less
expensive research terms and the more specific (and closer-to-buying) product terms.
342 | Chapter 12: The Zen of AdWords

In the car example, buying a car can involve a long and drawn-out period of research
(after all, it is a major purchase). So it may make sense to advertise at a variety of points
along the timeline involved, although the specifics of this depend upon your campaign
goals, marketing budgets, and so on.
As a matter of budget, it also may make sense to target the #2 or #3
advertising spot rather than the top spot in search results ads. Your ad
will get seen just as often, and the approach will possibly save you quite
a bit of money.
You should also be careful to use keyword terms that will limit clicks to people who
are actually appropriate for your business. If you sell wholesale supplies, make sure to
include modifiers like “bulk”—you don’t want to pay for clicks by people who search
for (and want to buy) single items, and will likely go elsewhere once they see you are a
wholesaler.
Getting Seen
After you’ve determined your keywords, the next step is getting the ads that correspond
to those keywords seen, and figuring out if your ads work.
You won’t be able to know if your ads work until they are seen. You need data to work
from. So start out by bidding high enough that your ads will show up first or second.
You can lower your bids to more comfortable levels after a few days, but in the begin-
ning you need plenty of impressions.
If you are running massive AdWords campaigns that involve many keywords, there are
third-party automated tools that can help with the management chores that this in-
volves. (Once again, I am not endorsing any specific commercial solution.)
Consider that search patterns are different at different times of day, and this may have
a major impact on your AdWords campaign, depending on the product you are selling.
For example, people search for different things when they are at the office and when
they are at home. Depending on your product, you may want to factor this in and pay
more for keywords when your target audience is active.
A similar concept is to vary your ads seasonally. Some ads are more appropriate for
winter than summer (or vice versa), and some ads are essentially intended for a specific
holiday season. Google Insights for Search can help you understand seasonality and
how it relates to your business.
In addition, ads related to a product launch should be timed to intensify around the
launch itself. They might start a few weeks before the ad, with visitors asked to add
their names to an email list. Then, plan to campaign extremely heavily just as the prod-
uct is launched.
The Customer Life Cycle | 343

Test Your Ads
With some good keywords in place, and high enough bidding so that your ads are being
shown, the next trick is to make sure that your ad copy is working—and getting quali-
fied visitors to click through your ad. (See Chapter 2 for some ideas about what works
in advertising campaigns, and Chapter 10 for suggestions for crafting ad copy for
AdWords.)
Make sure to include your keywords in the ad—this works to increase conversions,
since Google bolds the keyword text in the ad copy, which helps make your ad stand
out.
Your best bet is to have at least three or four ad variations running. Each of these
variations should have a different title. Google will rotate your ads to show the best
performer.
Ad copy is a great place for differentiation. Use your ad to show why and how you are
a little bit different from your competition.
Just as you should use your keyword selection to prequalify visitors, your ad copy
should prequalify them as well. You really don’t want to pay for clicks for anyone who
isn’t really interested. If you are giving away a free whitepaper but you require regis-
tration, indicate that fact (“Register for free whitepaper”) so that no one who is going
to balk at the registration requirement clicks.
Landing Pages That Work
Make sure the landing page that the visitor clicks through is effective. This isn’t a matter
of fancy graphics. Rather, it is an issue of form-follows-function design. You want it to
be easy for the visitors that you have worked so hard to land to find what they came
for. Be sure to provide About and Contact pages that are easy to find.
It’s a good idea to have a separate landing page for each major group of
AdWords ads. Specific landing pages designed for conversion tend to
work better than a more generic website home page.
If your landing page looks bad, or is hard to navigate, your entire expensive and elab-
orate AdWords campaign is for nothing. In this day and age of information glut, you
don’t have long to keep someone’s attention—a couple of seconds at most. So don’t
blow the opportunity.
More generally, your entire site should be designed to help enable the results you want.
It should be easy to find products on your site, the purchasing experience should be
smooth, and you are better off not trying to offer your visitors fishy add-ons in addition
to the product they came to find.
344 | Chapter 12: The Zen of AdWords

Tracking
The overall conversion rate across AdWords and the Web, depending on a number of
issues and definitions, is roughly between 1 and 2 percent. Are your numbers in line
with this statistic? You won’t know until you track conversions (see Chapter 13 for
information about the conversion tracking tools that Google AdWords provides and
to learn more about Google Analytics).
Balance
Successful AdWords campaigns have a kind of balance that you recognize when you
see. Each of the five aspects of an AdWords campaign affects the other aspects.
The right keywords won’t work if the price is wrong, or if the ad copy isn’t any good,
or if your web presence doesn’t convert. Great ad copy won’t do a thing if you’ve picked
the wrong keywords. All five aspects of your Zen AdWords campaign must be in place,
working harmoniously, and contained within a feedback loop. To stay in balance, you
need to know what work—and what doesn’t.
The Path of Indirection
In “The Customer Life Cycle” on page 341, I suggested a pretty straightforward ap-
proach to getting and converting customers. But sometimes, if you look in your heart,
the best—and most cost-effective—path is one of indirection. This is most often the
case when the customer is unable, or unwilling, to directly enter search terms that
describe their desired goal.
An example I like to use concerns someone who is a likely prospect for a dating site.
But this person doesn’t search for matchmaking sites. Rather, she might search for old
Meg Ryan movies such as Sleepless in Seattle. So a path-of-indirection AdWords cam-
paign for a matchmaking site might target searches for these romantic movies.
The trick here is that you have to essentially read the customer’s mind, and know what
they want better than they know themselves. It is easy to get this wrong.
AdWords campaigns that use indirection often don’t work. In fact, they should only
be used in very specific situations, and monitored carefully for effectiveness. But when
they do work, they can lead to surprisingly high conversion rates and be extremely
cost-effective.
Success via Iteration
With no exceptions that I am aware of, Google AdWords campaigns are not as suc-
cessful at the beginning as they can be. This implies that success comes via iteration.
With your feedback mechanism in place as I’ve suggested earlier in this chapter, you
Success via Iteration | 345

can take even a relatively poorly performing AdWords campaign and tweak it to make
it much better. To use successful iteration, you need to be tracking your AdWords
campaigns, and you need multiple ad variations. It’s amazing how much impact even
a small change in wording in an ad can have!
Basically, for each ad variation you should be tracking impressions, clicks, CTR, and
conversions.
As shown in Figure 12-1, iteration is basically a simple process. You start with two
related ads, run them a lot of times, and compare the results. Drop the poorer per-
forming of the two ads and create another variation. Repeat the performance.
Figure 12-1. Iteration means replacing each ad that performs poorly with another ad, and then
repeating the comparison
Before doing your comparisons, make sure you have enough ad im-
pressions so that the results are statistically significant.
There’s also an issue if all your metrics don’t agree. Suppose Ad A gets you a higher
CTR than Ad B, but Ad B does better in terms of conversions (always assuming you
have enough data on which to base conclusions). In this situation—which does come
up in the real world—it can be tricky to know which ad you should choose.
To make this determination, you’ll need to know more about the metrics of the business
that is being advertised. Generally, businesses that have a high profit margin per unit
sold should go for the higher CTR because they can afford to absorb the cost of the
excess clicks. Lower-profit-margin businesses should most likely select conversions as
the key metric because they need to make sure not to waste any CPC funds.
346 | Chapter 12: The Zen of AdWords

Although the specifics of metric comparison will vary depending on the business and
campaign, the idea of iteration, and of succeeding by applying metrics to iteration, will
not change.
Targeting the Competition
Businesses don’t operate in a vacuum, and we all have competition. In many ways, this
is a good thing because it forces us to be our best. Competition also means that we can
analyze the advertising campaigns of others in our business niche and follow their
example when that seems to make sense.
If you are new to a business niche, and there are established players who have been in
the business for years, you might take a look at the keywords these competitors have
targeted. To do this, type common industry terms into the Google search box and see
whose ads come up on the search results page.
As an initial place for your AdWords iterations, these keywords might be helpful. Do
take care in your ads to differentiate yourself from the competition by price, product,
or attitude: “We try harder!”, “The low-cost provider”, and “Truly effective widget”
are all examples of this kind of differentiation.
At the fairly extreme end of targeting the competition, you could actually bid on the
competition as keywords. If you figure that there are players so dominant in your in-
dustry that some buyers search for them by name, then it might make sense to advertise
on these search results. For example, a small photo stock provider might bid on the
names of the large stock photography aggregators Corbis and Getty.
If you are the dominant force in your industry, you might want to target your compe-
tition to make sure anyone who searches for them knows that you exist (and are an
appealing alternative). Of course, as the dominant force in an industry, you don’t want
to risk drawing attention to any other companies or making them seem more important
than they are.
Google may not allow you to bid on trademarked terms, and there may
also be issues of legality with this. Think carefully before starting an
AdWords “arms race” with a competitor, as this may simply raise the
cost of advertising for both of you.
Estimating Traffic
In the real world, the cost of running a campaign is an important part of the Zen of
deciding to run the campaign and which keywords to target.
The Traffic Estimator is best used to get a quick idea of how keywords will perform
and how that performance will affect the cost of running an ad group, without
actually adding the new keyword.
Estimating Traffic | 347

To open the Traffic Estimator, go to the Opportunities tab and click the “More tools…”
link to find the complete list of tools, as shown in Figure 12-2. The Traffic Estimator
is found at the bottom of the Optimize Your Ads column.
Figure 12-2. The Traffic Estimator can be found toward the bottom of the list of ad optimization tools
In the Traffic Estimator window, shown in Figure 12-3, enter the keywords you want
to investigate, a maximum CPC, language, location targeting method, and the countries
you want to target.
348 | Chapter 12: The Zen of AdWords

Figure 12-3. Enter keywords and a maximum CPC to get an idea of how well keywords will perform
without having to add them to an “actual” campaign
If you don’t estimate a maximum CPC in the Traffic Estimator, Google
will suggest one for you that will deliver ads in the top (1.0) position 85
percent of the time. As you can appreciate, this is an expensive CPC
choice, so to make the best use of the Traffic Estimator, you might want
to enter your own, more realistic, maximum CPC, depending upon your
budget.
Click Continue. The Traffic Estimator results screen, shown in Figure 12-4, gives you
an idea of the average position, clicks per day, and cost per day you can expect, given
the keywords you entered and the maximum CPC you specified.

add keywords to an ad
Exclusion
Sometimes what we don’t say is more important than what we do say. In that spirit,
AdWords provides a number of tools for excluding sites, topics, categories, and even
specific viewers from seeing your ads.
Excluding Sites and Categories
The Site and Category Exclusion Tool works only with Google content network sites
(e.g., not on search results pages). This tool lets you control the context of your ad-
vertising by excluding:
• Domains
• Subject matter (topics)
• Video (media types)
• Page categories
To start the Exclusion Tool, click the “More tools…” link under the Opportunities tab,
and then click the Site and Category Exclusion link.
To exclude a domain, subdomain, or directory within a domain, enter the URL(s) you
want to exclude in the Sites box, as shown in Figure 12-5.
Google’s TOS (Terms of Service) exclude many kinds of overtly objectionable content
from the Google content network. Think of these exclusions as a way to keep out
X-rated content, such as pornography.
At your discretion as an advertiser, you can ratchet the content your ads display against
down a notch further, well into R-rated territory, by selecting the kind of content you
want to exclude, as shown in Figure 12-6.
350 | Chapter 12: The Zen of AdWords

Figure 12-6. Excluding by topic is a way to help ensure that your ads appear in appropriate settings
Since topic exclusion is achieved via automated analysis of page and site
content, while most pages with objectionable content are excluded,
there’s no guarantee that something won’t slip past the software gate-
keepers. The same caveat applies to the exclusion of page types.
You can also decide to keep your ads out of video content, using the Media Types tab
shown in Figure 12-7.
Suppose you don’t want your ads to appear on MySpace pages. Checking Social Net-
works on the Page Types tab shown in Figure 12-8 will prevent this from happening.
Besides social networking sites, there are a number of categories of page types you can
choose to exclude, including parked domains, forums, image-sharing pages, and so on.
Figure 12-5. You can exclude individual sites on the Google content network
Exclusion | 351

Reviewing domains, topics, and page types for exclusion helps you ensure that your
ads are viewed in an appropriate context.
IP Exclusion
IP exclusion works in the opposite way as site and content exclusion. In site and content
exclusion, your ads cannot appear on certain kinds of sites. In IP exclusion, certain
people (based on their IP, or Internet Protocol, address) cannot be served your ads.
Figure 12-7. Use the Media Types tab to keep your ads out of video content
Figure 12-8. You can use the Page Types tab to keep your ads off certain kinds of pages
352 | Chapter 12: The Zen of AdWords

The IP Exclusion Tool opens from a link on the Tools page. You select one of your
campaigns from the drop-down “Select campaign” listbox, click Go, and then enter
one or more IP addresses in the box shown in Figure 12-9.
You can exclude an entire block of IP addresses using the asterisk wild-
card specifier, e.g., 123.4.5.*.
Figure 12-9. The IP addresses you list will be excluded from ad service
IP exclusion makes sense only if you know in advance the IPs of the
users you want to exclude—for example, all users from a certain do-
main. But users can always change the location they browse from. So if
you are trying to limit your ads to a geographic area, you are better off
doing this positively, using geographic keywords or with the AdWords
geo-targeting tools.
Probably the main use of IP exclusion is to stop your competitors from clicking on your
ads (and spuriously raising your CPC costs). The possible downside to IP exclusion is
that if you block a large ISP, you may lose a great deal of potentially profitable traffic.
Action Items
To master the Zen of AdWords and get the most out of your AdWords account (and
advertising budget), you should:
Action Items | 353

• Understand the five steps to AdWords conversion, considered from the viewpoint
of your prospective customers
• Make sure you have an appropriate offering at each step of the AdWords process
that corresponds to the steps taken by visitors

• Start with high initial bids so that you get a lot of impressions and have enough
data to see what works
• Create variations for each of your ads
• Create simple, but effective, landing pages
• Track which ads and keywords work, and which don’t
• Iterate, repeat, and keep testing and changing
• Consider indirection as a campaign strategy

CHAPTER 13
Advanced Performance Monitoring
If you have only a handful of campaigns and ad groups to keep track of, the Campaign
Summary window (shown in Chapter 10) should work fine. But once you are tracking
a dozen or more campaigns, each containing multiple ads and many keywords, in order
to retain your sanity—and do a good job of tracking your spending and performance
with the multiple campaigns and ads—you’ll need to take advantage of the excellent
AdWords reporting facility.
Conversion tracking means implementing a mechanism that tells you when visitors to
your site perform a specified action. More specifically, if you are paying for advertising
on a CPC basis, unless you are just interested in drawing eyeballs to your site, you’d
probably like to know whether this traffic brings you revenue.
Using AdWords conversion tracking, you can add code to your web pages that lets you
determine whether traffic generated by AdWords converts, that is, performs an action
you want to have happen, such as making a purchase, leaving contact information,
signing up for a subscription, or visiting a particular page.
This chapter explains how to use AdWords reports, and how to work with AdWords
conversion tracking. I’ll also introduce Google Analytics and explain some of the
sophisticated monitoring options available.
Using AdWords Reports
To create a report, click the Reports tab of the AdWords application. Click the Create
Report link just under the tab to open the Create Report window, shown in Figure 13-1.
355

Figure 13-1. To create a report, select the button next to the kind of report you want to generate
Kinds of Reports
The first step in the Create Report window is to specify the kind of report you’d like to
create. The available report types are:
Placement/Keyword
Provides performance information for all sites targeted and/or keywords across an
entire account or in selected campaigns in an account.
Ad
Provides performance information for each of the ads in an account or in selected
campaigns in an account.
URL
Provides performance information by destination URL for the ads in an account
or in selected campaigns in an account.
356 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

Ad Group
Provides aggregate performance information for the Ad Groups in one or more
campaigns in your account.
Campaign
Provides aggregate performance information for one or more campaigns in your
account.
Account
Provides aggregate performance information for your account.
Demographic
Provides the demographic information that is available for an account.
Geographic
Sorts account information by geographic origin of users who received or clicked
on your ads.
Search Query
Shows the search queries that triggered the display of your ad and led to clicks.
Placement
Shows performance data for Google content network (e.g., AdSense) sites where
your ad has been shown.
Reach and Frequency
Reports on performance using reach (the number of people who have seen your
ads) versus frequency (the number of times each viewer saw your ad).
Creating all these reports works in more or less the same way, with
minor differences in your ability to include specific kinds of data (or
not). I’ll only show you the details of creating one kind of report, the
Placement/Keyword report. But don’t worry—once you know how to
create one of these reports, with minor variations in the information you
choose to display, you really do know how to create all of them!
As an example, here’s how to create the first kind of report on the list, a Placement/
Keyword report.
Creating a Placement/Keyword Report
To create a Placement/Keyword report, in the Create Report window choose the Place-
ment/Keyword Report type. Next, in the Settings area, shown in Figure 13-2, choose
a date range and which campaigns and groups you want to include in the report.
Using AdWords Reports | 357

Figure 13-2. You can choose to display all campaigns and groups in the report or you can be more
selective
Here’s a little more detail about the choices shown in Figure 13-2:
View (Unit of Time)
You can choose to display data as an aggregated line of summarized information
or as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly data.
Date Range
You can choose a preset period to be covered by the report or select your own date
range.
Campaigns and Ad Group
You can choose to display information for all campaigns in your account or for one
or more campaigns.
The Advanced Settings window is not shown by default. To open this window, which
allows you to customize your report with columns as shown in Figure 13-3, click the
triangle to the left of Add or Remove Columns.
Using the Advanced Settings window, you can drill down to almost any level of detail.
A good use for adding specific placements and keywords to the Level of Detail of an
advanced report is to drill down into ads and keywords that you are specifically scru-
tinizing—because performance may be borderline acceptable, not terrible and not
great.
Clicking the triangle to the left of Filter Your Results opens another window of ad-
vanced options, shown in Figure 13-4. The drop-down lists in the Filter Your Results
window are useful if you are primarily interested in a single thing—for example, key-
words that have high CTR.
358 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

In the final window of the account creation, shown in Figure 13-5, you can choose to
save your report as a template, schedule your report, or email the completed report.
It’s very convenient to schedule a report so that it is automatically run after a given
amount of time has elapsed—for example, every day or once a week. The best part of
this feature is that you can have the scheduled report automatically emailed to you.
Scheduling reports and having them emailed to you means that the highlights of your
AdWords activity will appear in your email inbox, so you don’t have to remember to
login to AdWords to monitor your account.
Attachments are sent as ZIP archive files, and zipped files sent this way
cannot be larger than 2 megabytes. If your attachment is larger than this
size, Google will not send it, but rather will email a notification that your
report has been created.
Figure 13-3. The default values for columns are shown in the Advanced Settings window
Using AdWords Reports | 359

When you are satisfied with your choices, click Create Report.
To view your report, in the Report Center window click on the report name once it has
been generated (Figure 13-6).
Report generation will generally take a few minutes, during which time
a message will be displayed saying that the report is in progress.
Figure 13-4. You can filter your results—for example, you might want to show only keywords with
a good CTR

A report like the one shown in Figure 13-7 will be displayed on screen.
There’s no way to edit a report once you’ve created it. If you want to
change something about a report, you’ll need to create an entirely new
report using the Create Similar link in the Report Center window. You
can then delete the first report from the Report Center if you want.

Report Download Formats
AdWords offers you five different formats for reports that you want to download:
.csv (for Excel)
This format uses comma-separated values encoded using the UTF-16LE character
set and is a native Excel format.
.csv
This format is plain-text (using the UTF-8 character set) comma-separated values,
and is good choice if you will be loading the report into a database program. In
addition, reports created in .csv are likely to produce smaller files than reports
created in .csv (for Excel), and can probably be read by Excel. So if your reports
are large, you should experiment with using .csv rather than .csv (for Excel).
.html
The report is generated as a standard HTML file.
.tsv
This is a tab-separated-value format using the UTF-8 character set.
.xml
Reports are presented in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), a good choice for
publishing data to multiple formats. It’s worth noting that reports downloaded in
the .xml format feature more precision than the other formats—currency values
are reported to one millionth of a unit!
Reports that are over 100 megabytes in size can only be downloaded in .xml format.
Google suggests splitting up reports that are this big into a number of smaller reports—
for example, by covering fewer keywords or shorter date ranges—to view these reports
in other formats.
Conversion Tracking
Conversion tracking is used to see whether the traffic that you’ve paid to drive to your
site with AdWords actually does what you want it to do. If your site is in the business
of selling widgets, then all the click throughs in the world don’t do you any good unless
your site visitors buy your widgets. Conversion tracking is a mechanism that helps you
understand empirically whether site visitors coming via AdWords are converting (i.e.,
performing the action you desire), and what percentage of the visitors sent to your site
by AdWords do, in fact, convert.
ROI and Conversion Tracking
If you understand what a conversion is worth to you, and know the percentage of CPC
AdWords visitors who do convert (the conversion ratio), then it is easy to calculate your
return on investment (ROI) for an AdWords campaign. If the amount each conversion
is worth multiplied by the conversion ratio is greater than your average CPC, then your
AdWords campaign is producing a positive ROI—and probably makes sense.
362 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

You could write this as an equation. For an AdWords campaign to make sense in the
long run, the following should be true:
Conversion amount ×  Conversion ratio > Average CPC
Understanding Conversion Tracking
Google’s underlying conversion-tracking mechanism is fairly simple and works as
follows:
• You add some special Google conversion tracking code to a results page on your
site.
• You make sure that the results page will open when a visitor is converted, for
example, by buying something (in the case of a purchase, the results page usually
doubles as an order confirmation).
• When a user clicks your AdWords ad, Google adds a cookie to the user’s computer
to track the user.
• When a user with the Google AdWords cookie on his computer opens the results
page, a conversion is logged, and a special tracking message is displayed to the user.
This process is shown in Figure 13-8.
Figure 13-8. Conversion tracking is triggered when a user with an AdWords click-through cookie
opens your results page
Conversion Tracking | 363

An interesting, and somewhat controversial, feature of Google AdWords conversion
tracking is that as part of the tracking, Google notifies users that they are being tracked.
This notification is produced by the Google-supplied code you add to the results page.
A tracked user sees a message with the title Google Site Stats, and the message includes
a “learn more” link back to Google.
Google explains that it prefers to be aboveboard about its actions, and that the “learn
more” link is a chance for users to understand Google’s privacy policies and to reject
the Google tracking cookie if they wish.
You can choose to omit the message about tracking if you desire; how-
ever, Google’s TOS requires that you include information in your site’s
privacy statement if this is omitted.
Most major advertising programs do provide conversion tracking options, and not all
programs that track users and conversions “brand” the process. Users who click
through ads in these other programs never know they are being tracked.
The tracking message Google displays may make some users uneasy, and a few adver-
tisers have decided not to track AdWords conversions. That said, you have to admire
the aboveboard aspect of Google’s notification to users that they are, in fact, being
tracked.
If you see the “Google Site Stats – learn more” message in the course of
your web surfing, it means that a Google AdWords cookie on your
computer has tracked a successful conversion.
You can define a conversion in any way you’d like, as long as you can put up a web
page that the user opens when the conversion event takes place. The most common
conversions are:
Purchases
The conversion occurs when the user makes the purchase, and the order confir-
mation page doubles as the results page.
Lead generation
The conversion takes place when the user provides contact information, and the
“A sales representative will be in touch with you shortly” page is also the results
page.
Subscription signup
The conversion takes place when the user signs up to join a community or subscribe
to a newsletter; the membership or subscription confirmation page is also the
tracking results page.
364 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

Viewing a key page
If the point of your AdWords campaign is to subtly direct users to a specific, crucial
page, then that important page can double as a tracking results page.
AdWords conversion tracking uses the same programmatic model as
the Google AdSense program (and other contextual content ad pro-
grams). The code you embed in your results pages uses JavaScript to set
some variables, and then call a script on Google’s servers.
By the very nature of conversion tracking, and the “mash-up” nature of development
on the Web, conversion tracking has to coexist with a variety of technologies used for
e-commerce and web deployment. The bottom line is that you can use Google’s con-
version tracking in any web page that can work with JavaScript—which is almost any
web page. Essentially, the way it works is more or less the same regardless of the tech-
nology that serves or generates the pages: you use Google AdWords to generate the
conversion tracking JavaScript code, which you embed in a results page on your site.
Google specifically expects conversion tracking to be used with sites that use the fol-
lowing technologies:
• Yahoo! Stores
• Sites that enable users to purchase goods or services with PayPal
• .NET web pages (ASPX)
• JavaServer Pages (JSP)
• Sites written in PHP
• Sites prepared using Macromedia Dreamweaver
As an example, I will show how to add conversion tracking to a PayPal
Buy Now button for purchases, and to a PHP page for users who open
this key page. Implementing conversion tracking works comparably for
these other technologies—just add the Google-generated JavaScript
code to your results page.
It’s up to you to create a results page and have it up on your site. Google will not do
this for you. (Of course, if you are selling goods or services, you probably already have
an order confirmation page!)
Conversion tracking reports
Under the Reporting tab, you can view all the conversion tracking reporting, edit ex-
isting actions, or create new actions (Figure 13-9).

Tracking Google Analytics goals as conversions
There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to install the AdWords con-
version code or you require more advanced tracking such as Event Tracking events.
Google AdWords now allows you to link your Google Analytics goals to your AdWords
conversions to allow more effective campaign management and better ROI from your
campaign. This will not import historical data from your account, but it will start im-
porting from the day that you link the accounts, and based on existing campaigns the
Goals data will begin appearing after approximately one to two weeks.
You need to make sure that once the accounts are linked you have opted
into Data Sharing from your Analytics account.
Tracking views of content network ads as conversions
Google AdWords has recently released a new feature to improve measurement of con-
versions for display advertising running on the Google content network. The view-
through conversions report can assist with brand awareness campaigns where the ad is
seen but not immediately clicked on. The conversion can occur within 30 days of the
display ad appearing—but no click generated—and can attribute a single impression
to multiple view-through conversion events.
The view-through reporting follows the industry standard of last click,
last impression.
366 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

Tracking PayPal Purchases
You can easily track conversions defined as the user making a purchase by clicking a
PayPal Buy Now button. The possibilities are to add a new Buy Now button to your
page and use it to track conversions, or add a conversion tracking mechanism to an
existing Buy Now button.
You can track conversions made by purchases in a PayPal shopping cart
in much the same fashion as with the PayPal Buy Now button.
Setting up a new PayPal button
The first part of the process of adding conversion tracking code is to use AdWords to
generate the AdWords JavaScript code you’ll need.
To get this code, select Conversions from the Reporting tab drop-down list. Click “New
conversion,” and give the conversion action a name so that you’ll be able to find it later.
Next, select the type of the action from the Tracking Purpose drop-down box. The
choices are:
• Other
• Purchase/Sale
• Signup
• Lead
• View of a key page
Click “Save and continue.” The Code Settings window, shown in Figure 13-10, will
open.
You can state the value of each conversion to you. It’s helpful to do this, although
variable values can also be used in code.
Indicate the security level of the results page, the language, and the formatting of the
tracking message. You can also choose to omit the tracking message by selecting the
None radio button.
For a PayPal button, you should check Purchase/Sale and enter a nom-
inal amount.
Click “Save and get code.” The Code page, shown in Figure 13-11, will open.
Conversion Tracking | 367

Grab the JavaScript code shown and paste it into the body of your “action” page (the
page the users reach when they have converted, for example, by buying something).
For this example, I named the page confirmation.html.
If you don’t maintain your own website, and someone else is updating
your website code, you can send this code snippet to them by clicking
“Send conversion tracking code to somebody else.”
Here’s a sample of what this code looks like (of course, the conversion ID and label
will be different for your own pages):
<!-- Google Code for Buying Conversion Page -->
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
<!--
var google_conversion_id = 1070313714;
var google_conversion_language = "en_US";
var google_conversion_format = "1";
var google_conversion_color = "ffffff";
var google_conversion_label = "oeR6COTFnAEQ8uGu_gM";
//-->
</script>
<script language="JavaScript"

</noscript>
Make sure the page has been loaded on your web server.
Next, log in to your PayPal account. Click the Merchant Services tab. Expand the
Website Payments Standard link shown in the Business Solutions area (on the left of
Figure 13-12).
Click the Buy Now Button link, and configure your button as you’d like—for example,
by setting a price and choosing from the button graphics that PayPal makes available.
Figure 13-11. It’s easy to copy and paste the code that Google provides
Conversion Tracking | 369

You can add AdWords conversion tracking features to any kind of Pay-
Pal button or cart; this example shows a single Buy Now button to keep
things simple.
Figure 13-12. PayPal merchant account holders can use the payment resources their account provides
to add Buy Now buttons to their websites
Next, expand Customize Advanced features. In the Customize Buyer’s Experience area,
locate “Take customer to a specific page (URL) after successful checkout,” shown in
Figure 13-13. Make sure the box is checked and enter the address of your conversion
page.
Click Create Button, and the HTML form code for your PayPal button (including the
reference to the tracking results page) will be generated for you, as shown in Fig-
ure 13-14.
Copy and paste the PayPal code into your web page used to make purchases and upload
the page to your web server.

completes a purchase

transaction is successfully completed

Depending on the graphics you chose for your Buy Now button and the layout for your
page, your site visitors will see a page that looks something like Figure 13-15.
Figure 13-15. The PayPal Buy Now button—which will propel a user who makes a successful

in use
372 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

The final step, of course, is to test that conversion tracking is actually working. You
can wait for a user to click through from an AdWords ad and complete a transaction.
You’ll then see the conversion in your Campaign Summary (and your reports) with a
time delay (of up to about 24 hours).
You can also initiate a conversion tracking test yourself, but it will cost you for the
clicks you make.
First, search Google for one of your ads. Click through your own ad (this is not illegal,
but it will cost you for the click!).
Next, open the results page. Note that since you know the address for the results page,
such as http://www.digitalfieldguide.com/confirmation.html, you don’t have to actually
use the Buy Now PayPal button—just open the results page.
Your actions will record a conversion, which will show up in the AdWords Campaign
Summary and AdWords reports after the time delay.
Tracking Visitors to a Crucial Page
Suppose you are not quite so concerned with whether visitors actually make a purchase;
you just want to determine whether site visitors are visiting a key page.
For example, part of the strategy of the AdWords campaign that sends traffic to the
Photoblog 2.0 at http://www.digitalfieldguide.com/blog/ is that some of this traffic will
migrate along internal site links to the page that provides information about image
licensing, http://www.digitalfieldguide.com/licensing.php. It would be nice to know how
many of the AdWords-driven visitors to the photo blog are actually interested in paying
for an image license. Using AdWords conversion tracking, it’s easy to find this out.
The first step is to generate new conversion tracking code, by choosing “View of a key
page” as the conversion tracking type in the definition of the conversion action (Fig-
ure 13-17).
It probably doesn’t make much sense to assign a value to this kind of
“conversion.” As opposed to a purchase, there is no clear value to a site
view, even if it is something useful to track.
Click “Save action and get code,” and copy and paste the conversion tracking code into
the key results page. Here’s the code:
<!-- Google Code for licensing Conversion Page -->
<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
<!--
var google_conversion_id = 1070313714;
var google_conversion_language = "en_US";
var google_conversion_format = "1";
var google_conversion_color = "ffffff";

</noscript>
A new Google conversion tracking feature allows you to track many
conversions per click—for example, if someone clicks through to your
site, registers for an email newsletter, and also buys something.
Google Analytics
The idea behind Google Analytics is similar to AdWords conversion tracking: add a
code snippet to your web pages so that you can understand what works and what
doesn’t. However, comparing Google Analytics to AdWords conversion tracking is a
bit like comparing a fully loaded Ferrari to a Ford Model T. Both programs are intended
Figure 13-17. Choose “View of a key page” if you want to track how many users migrate from an
AdWords click through to a specific page on your site
374 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

to help website owners understand website dynamics so that they can make better
business decisions and enhance performance. But beyond shared goals, there really is
no comparison.
Google Analytics and AdWords conversion tracking do not interfere
with each other. In other words, there’s no reason you can’t have both
running at the same time.
Google Analytics offers a wide breadth of functionality. To start with, the program
shows you where your visitors come from and how they interact with your site. Ulti-
mately, you can use this feature to calculate your rate of return for each AdWords
keyword.
In addition to basic conversion tracking, Google Analytics offers:
• Visitor flow tracking through your site
• Understanding the sources of referrals to your site
• Page view information across your entire site
• Advanced conversion reporting
• Funnel analysis
Funnel Analysis
Funnel analysis takes a defined multipage process, such as checking out with a credit
card. Generally, it takes more than one page to actually enter all one’s information and
complete a purchase using a credit card. For you, the goal of the funnel is to have the
site visitor complete the transaction.
It’s a fact that at each step of a funnel process, some visitors will leave your site. Ob-
viously, you want to keep these departures to a minimum.
Good funnel analysis will provide a breakdown of which pages in the funnel cause
problems and where visitors go when they leave the funnel. Armed with this informa-
tion, you can begin to attack the problems in the funnel.
For example, perhaps visitors don’t complete a purchase three pages into the process
when they see the shipping charges. The solution might be to lower shipping charges
or put an indication of the amount of the charges at the beginning of the funnel.
Funnel visualization helps you find out which pages result in lost conversions and where
your would-be customers go. If you try a change, you can use further analysis of the
funnel to see how well the change is working.
Google Analytics | 375

Google Analytics can’t solve website performance issues for you. However, it very likely
can help you pinpoint problem areas—so you can solve the problems yourself. In ad-
dition, the price is right (Google Analytics is free). It’s worth noting that this is
enterprise-caliber software that can be used by everyone from mom-and-pop shops to
large organizations. Furthermore, Google Analytics will help you monitor your site
performance even if you are not using other Google products. There’s no requirement
that either AdSense or AdWords must be implemented on your site for you to use
Google Analytics.
Getting Started with Google Analytics
To get started with Google Analytics, click on the Reporting tab of the Google AdWords
page and select Google Analytics. The window shown in Figure 13-18 will load.
Figure 13-18. It’s easy to create a Google Analytics account from within AdWords
There are two options available. I will show the option for linking to an existing Google
Analytics account in Figure 13-19, but will take you through the steps of creating a new
account as shown in Figure 13-20.
Assuming you don’t already have an Analytics account, choose the “Create my free
Google Analytics account” option and click Continue. The New Account Signup win-
dow, shown in Figure 13-20, will open. Enter the domain you want to track.
376 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

Once you’ve created an Analytics account, you can add additional do-
mains to be tracked from the Analytics Overview page by clicking Add
New Profile. Note, however, that each domain requires its own unique
tracking ID and JavaScript code snippet.
Click Continue. The Tracking Code page, shown in Figure 13-21, will open.
On the code page, you’ll see your ID as well as some tracking code. This tracking code
needs to be included in every page on your site, usually just above the </body> tag.
Figure 13-19. Link AdWords to an existing Google Analytics account
Figure 13-20. Although you can further differentiate, aggregate websites are the fundamental unit for
tracking

For example:

<body>
...
   <script type="text/javascript">
var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." :
"http://www.");
document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js'
type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
try {
var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-7959080-2");
pageTracker._trackPageview();
} catch(err) {}</script>
</body>
</html>
Figure 13-21. Google Analytics generates the JavaScript code you’ll need to add to your pages
378 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

If you don’t personally maintain your website, that’s fine: just pass the code snippet
along to your tech person.
Actually, all you may need to pass along to the techie is the ID; the rest
of the code is the same across the board.
You should try to paste the Google Analytics code as it was written without changing
line breaks. You can check to make sure the code has been correctly added by opening
your web pages and viewing the source code.
If your website is generated from a database using a content management system, there
is likely an easier way to add the Google Analytics code to each page than doing it by
hand.
For example, there are a number of plug-ins, like the one shown in Figure 13-22, that
add the Google Analytics code to all the pages in a WordPress blog. All you have to do
is enter the ID number in the Plugins settings page.
Once the tracking code has been added to your pages, you’ll start to see data in the
Google Analytics Dashboard, shown in Figure 13-23.
To open the Analytics Dashboard from within Google AdWords, go to
the Analytics tab and choose the website you are interested in from the
View Reports drop-down list.
Using Google Analytics
The JavaScript code that Google Analytics asks you to add to your web pages passes
information back to a Google Analytics server about your site visitors, your pages, and
the actions of the visitors on the page (for example, what links were clicked). The real
value of Google Analytics is in the processing and presentation of this data.
The Dashboard
When you’ve chosen which URL you’d like to view the reports for, the Dashboard
opens (Figure 13-23). By default, the date range at the top is the past 30 days.
A line graph beneath the date shows you the number of visits for each day. There is a
summary of the vital statistics for the 30 days below that include pages per visit, average
time on the site, and percent of new visits.
Google Analytics | 379

When you change the date range, the Dashboard refreshes, making it easy to notice
trends. You can also compare data from two different time frames. The differences
between the two sets of data are displayed in green (for a positive change) or red (when
the change is negative).
Map Overlay
The Map Overlay, shown on the lower right of Figure 13-23, is an important tool for
websites targeting visitors from more than one location. You can use the Map Overlay
to drill down and quickly (and visually) find out the countries and cities that your site
visitors come from.
Figure 13-22. You can use a plug-in to add Google Analytics capabilities across an entire WordPress
blog
380 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

When you pass the mouse over a city on the Map Overlay, you can find out the number
of visits from the city for a given date range, as well as the number of visits from a
specific IP.
The Map Overlay feature is best used to track promotional efforts aimed at specific
geographic regions. For example, using the overlay of the United States and drilling
down to the state level, you can view visitors by state, county, or city.
Content Overview
The Content Overview pane puts page views and paths on your site in context. When
you click on a link in the Content Overview, such as the site home page, the home page
is loaded in the browser with visuals next to each link that show the number of visitors
that clicked on the link. When the visitor clicked on a link from this home page, you
can follow the link. The subsequent page loads with the site overlay, allowing you to
follow frequent visitor paths.
If you are trying to improve the performance of a website, it’s key to put yourself in the
position of a visitor to your site. The point of the Content Overview is to follow the
Figure 13-23. The Google Analytics Dashboard helps you understand your site performance dynamics
at a glance
Google Analytics | 381

actual behavior of users, rather than your subjective impressions of the user experience,
so that you can make adjustments as necessary.
Information in the Content Overview, each with a statistical overlay, includes:
Navigation summary
How visitors found your content
Entrance paths
Paths visitors used to get to your content
Landing page optimization
Top entrance sources and top entrance keywords per page
Click patterns
Site overlay of visitor click behavior through your site
Advanced Segments
Advanced Segments, currently in beta, found on the Settings panel, allows you to filter
your visitor data in a variety of preset ways, including:
• All Visitors (default)
• New Visitors
• Returning Visitors
• Paid Traffic (AdWords)
• Nonpaid Traffic
• Search Traffic (Google, Yahoo!, MSN, Ask)
• Direct (bookmarks)
• Referral (links from other sites, articles, blogs)
• Visits with Conversions (AdWords conversions)
• Visits with Transactions (e-commerce turned on)
• Visits from iPhones
• Nonbounce Visits (those who don’t exit immediately)
You can also create a custom segment.
Goals
Goals allow you set up specific conversion goals similar to AdWords conversions. The
funnel visualization tools in this section are a great way to spot possible problems with
the way visitors are supposed to “funnel” through your site.
382 | Chapter 13: Advanced Performance Monitoring

Custom Reports
If you find that you don’t use a particular Google Analytics metric, but you really want
more information about another, you can build your own Custom Reports.
Custom Reports allow you to present data in different ways to help with your reporting
and analysis. It’s easy to design one-off reports for your needs. Breaking down data by
metrics (such as “content, goals, e-commerce”) or by dimensions (such as “visitors,
traffic sources, systems”) can provide valuable insight. You can set up multiple tabs,
each displaying custom sets of data, that might relate to your goals.
You have a lot more control over how data is presented than with premade reports,
and you can set up multiple reports, such as a weekly visitor or a monthly sales report.
Website Optimizer
Part of the idea of Google Analytics is to take the guesswork and hunches out of website
traffic analysis. Instead of your feeling about what visitors will do, you have the actual
paths and click numbers. But data in a vacuum isn’t particularly helpful. If your re-
sponse to all this information is to build new site pages and features based on hunches,
then the analysis isn’t as useful as it might be.
The point of the Website Optimizer is to try to determine the benefit of one set of pages
as opposed to another objectively rather than by hunch, thus better matching the
intelligence provided by Google Analytics.
To run Website Optimizer, you need to be prepared to sort through the data provided
by multiple A-B tests of specific pages with specific features to see which performs best.
In other words, Website Optimizer provides a testbed for comparing sequences of pairs
of pages. In a well-designed test, each pair deviates from one another in only one way.
Once you’ve determined the best choice, then you can move on to the next deviation.
Obviously, it takes plenty of visitor data to make Website Optimizer statistically sig-
nificant. Google Website Optimizer advises that for pages that receive less than 1,000
page views, A/B tests will be the most effective for testing variations.
Website Optimizer can be started from a number of places within Google Analytics:
from the Reporting tab, from the Opportunities tab within AdWords, or by direct
navigation. See Figures 13-24 and 13-25.
Action Items
To monitor the performance of your ads and campaigns, you should:
• Customize, generate, and save report templates that cover your key business
metrics
• Schedule reports to be regularly emailed
Action Items | 383

• Implement conversion tracking for purchases, key page views, and other events
that are significant to your business model
• Start a Google Analytics account that is connected to your AdWords account and
add the Google Analytics JavaScript code to each of your pages
• If you maintain a WordPress blog, add an Analytics plug-in
• Create funnel analysis reports for each of your key conversion areas
• Use Google Analytics overlays to understand the behavior of visitors as they pass
through your site
• Consider implementing page comparison tests to see which pages work better

CHAPTER 14
AdWords beyond CPC
When Google started out, the commercial focus of the company was CPC advertising—
text ads that cost money to advertisers when they were clicked. (Of course, before that
Google was a search company!) As time has gone by, Google’s commercial offerings
have expanded way beyond CPC and out of the virtual world into the real world. For
the most part, these advertising options are available from your AdWords account.
Even after recent contractions, these offerings are substantial and should command
your attention.
This chapter explains how to use Google’s tools to create display ads, which are site
placement ads on the Google content network. (Uploading your premade display ads
was covered in Chapter 10.) Site placement ads are themselves an expansion of Google’s
original advertising model and were explained in Chapter 10.
Moving outward from the virtual world, this chapter explains how you can use Ad-
Words to create and place interactive visual, mobile, and video ads.
Display Ad Builder
In Chapter 10, I explained how you can upload a graphic to create an image ad that
can be served on the Google content network. Uploaded graphics can be in .gif, .jpg,
or .png file formats. The graphic for this kind of ad needs to fit into a predetermined
format; the nomenclature and sizes for these formats are reviewed in Table 14-1.
You’ll find these sizes referred to in Google’s documentation about im-
age ads as “IAB-approved” sizes, where IAB is the Interactive Advertis-
ing Bureau. You can find more information at http://www.iab.net.

The adjusted-size column in Table 14-1 represents the actual size of the
graphics that Google will run in ads it serves. The “missing” 11 or 22
horizontal pixels are used by your display URL and the Google “feed-
back” link. When you upload graphics, you can have Google adjust the
size for you, but it’s a better idea to upload graphics already in the ad-
justed size.
Since Google provides tools for accomplishing a great many tasks, it probably will not
surprise you to learn that there’s a Google tool—the Display Ad Builder—for creating
site and banner ad graphics if you don’t already have what you need. The extensive
interactivity of what you can build with Display Ad Builder goes way beyond what you
can do with a single uploaded file, so you should consider taking advantage of these
capabilities even if you are experienced with graphics and have premade imagery.
To begin the Display Ad Builder, start a new campaign with placements as explained
in Chapter 10. When the ad creation menu opens, instead of creating a text ad, click
“Display ad builder” (shown in Figure 14-1).
Figure 14-1. Choose “Display ad builder” to create a visual ad using Google’s templates
386 | Chapter 14: AdWords beyond CPC

The Display Ad Builder, shown in Figure 14-2, will open.
Figure 14-2. The categories let you choose from a variety of interesting formats
Essentially, the Display Ad Builder provides templates in a number of categories that
you use as the basis for your own ads. There are two major types of ads: fully custom-
izable and predesigned by industry. Fully customizable ads assume that you’ll be up-
loading the graphics to make the ad work; predesigned ads provide existing graphics
that will work for many business niches. These types of ads and their categories are
shown in Table 14-2. You can sort the ad templates within each category by highest
click-through rate, most popular (meaning most AdWords users have selected the
template), and newest.

Choose the category of template you’d like to use to create your image (the General
category is shown in Figure 14-2 and the Seasonal category is shown in Figure 14-3).
Depending on the category you’ve chosen, you’ll have less or more graphical and text
elements to supply to complete the ad.
For example, in the “Rich media” category, the Photo Gallery template, shown in
Figure 14-4, lets you upload up to six different photos, with accompanying text for
each element.
The Halloween template from the Seasonal category, shown in Figure 14-5, is pretty
straightforward—all you need to enter is your URL, logo, and three lines of text.
Predesigned industry ads are the simplest of all; after all, “predesigned” means that the
graphics are already in place. For the most part, all you’ll need to supply if these ads
work for you is a logo and URL. Figure 14-6 shows some of the premade ads available
for Entertainment businesses.
Image Ad Guidelines
Image ads must comply with normal Google editorial policies regarding such things as
acceptable content, competitive claims, and so on (see Chapter 10 for details). In ad-
dition, there are some specific guidelines for visual ads.
The most important of these requirements is that visual ads should avoid unconven-
tional ad layouts. Specifically, visual ads should occupy the entire form factor selected,
they cannot appear sideways or upside down, and they cannot be segmented or contain
multiple copies of themselves within the ad or appear to be more than one ad.
388 | Chapter 14: AdWords beyond CPC

In addition, you cannot add your own user bar or image footer to an image ad. This is
because Google automatically appends your image with a user bar that contains links
to your URL and to the “Ads By Google” feedback page.
It should go without saying that you need to either own the copyright or be licensed to
use any image you upload to Google.
Also needless to say, Google reserves the right to review image ads and to disapprove
them if they fail to comply with normal editorial or image-specific guidelines.
You may recall from Chapter 10 that unsubstantiated competitive claims are forbidden.
It’s hard to substantiate a competitive claim in a 105-word text ad, but it’s worth noting
that you may have more of a chance of doing so with charts and graphs in a visual ad—
particularly if the image ad links to a landing page that helps substantiate the compet-
itive claims.

Display ads appear on content sites (and, in some cases, within products) in the Google
network. Remember that they do not appear in Google search results. This means that
for any of your display ads to appear on a content publisher’s site, your campaign must
have enabled the content network. In addition, website owners must have approved
image and display ads before they will appear on a specific site.
Affiliate Advertising with Google
Affiliate marketing, explained in Chapter 5, works so that you (the advertiser) pay the
publisher (website owner) only when a specific action takes place—usually a purchase.
Website owners who participate in affiliate marketing schemes essentially become your
partner and are paid only when you actually sell something.

When Google bought DoubleClick in 2008, Google acquired the DoubleClick
Performics Affiliate network, now renamed the Google Affiliate Network.
The Google Affiliate Network is a top-quality affiliate network, with advertisers such
as Barnes & Noble and Verizon, and should be considered more than competitive with
the two largest affiliate networks outside of Amazon, Commission Junction and Link-
Share (described in Chapter 5). Advertisers and publishers are considered on an indi-
vidual basis for inclusion in the program, and the Google Affiliate Network is noted
for the amount of individual attention given to the unique goals of affiliate advertisers.
At this point in time, the Google Affiliate Network is not integrated with AdWords or
other tools available to Google advertisers, except for AdSense, which is used to
distribute earnings.

Mobile Ads
Mobile ads are ads that appear on wireless devices such as the Apple iPhone or Google’s
G1. Many sites target these appliances using some variant of wireless markup language.
If you advertise a local product or service, particularly one whose customers are most
likely to find you on a mobile device, it makes a great deal of sense to place targeted
mobile ads.
To create a mobile ad, in AdWords start a new campaign with placements. In the
“Create an ad” window, select “Mobile ad,” shown in Figure 14-7.
Figure 14-6. Predesigned industry ads are templates for specific niches (Entertainment shown)
392 | Chapter 14: AdWords beyond CPC

Figure 14-7. Select “Mobile ad” to create an ad targeted at mobile devices
The “Design your mobile ad window,” shown in Figure 14-8, will open. For a text ad,
enter the headline, description, and URL. Note that the headline and description are
each limited to 18 characters, and the display URL can be no more than 20 characters
(if Google CPC text ads are terse, mobile ads are very succinct).
Figure 14-8. Mobile text ads are pretty much like regular CPC ads—but shorter
Mobile Ads | 393

If you link your business’s phone number to the ad, customers can call
you by clicking rather than having to open your mobile web page.
To create a mobile image ad rather than a text ad, choose the Image radio button and
upload your ad in one of the specified file sizes, file formats, and aspect ratios, as shown
in Figure 14-9.
Figure 14-9. You can upload a graphic for mobile image ads
The mobile file specifications that Google allows conform to the
standards set up by the Mobile Marketing Association.
Once you’ve created your image or text mobile ad, click “Save ad.” A mockup of your
ad will be displayed (Figure 14-10). Ensure that you set the targeting and network
options.
394 | Chapter 14: AdWords beyond CPC

Figure 14-10. As your mobile ads show up with your other ads, it is advised to create separate
campaigns for them
Video Ads
Video ads appear in placements on the Google content network and can now be created
using the Display Ad Builder, which builds the whole ad in one step. Your video ad will
appear as a static image until a user clicks on it and your video is played.
If the user clicks the display URL at the bottom of the ad, or clicks the ad while it plays,
the user will be taken to the advertiser’s website.
You can pay for click-to-play video ads on either a CPC (keyword) or
CPM (placement) basis.
To create a video ad, in the Display Ad Builder choose the “In-Stream video ad” link
shown in Figure 14-11.
The first step in creating your video ad is to name your ad and then upload the video,
as shown in Figure 14-12. Once you have selected your file, click the Upload button
for Google to start processing your video. You can also select an already uploaded video
or check on the progress of a conversion, as shown in Figure 14-13.
After you click the Choose File button shown in Figure 14-12, you’ll be prompted to
upload your video. You can upload videos in a variety of formats, including AVI,
QuickTime, and MPEG. Google will transcode these videos into the Flash format.
Once your video has been uploaded and processed, select it, add the companion banner
image, and enter the display and destination URLs, as shown in Figure 14-12. Click
the “Preview ad” box at the top right to preview your ad, then click “Save ad” at the top.
Video Ads | 395

Advertising on TV
Creating a professional quality video ad is not at all the same thing as creating a video
ad for display on YouTube (although many online video ads do have high production
values).
That said, if you have experience creating television ads or want to get started with the
help of advertising professionals, Google has created a marketplace to help you opti-
mize your placements of television ads. The Google TV Ads website is located at http:
//www.google.com/adwords/tvads/.
Benefits of TV ads include flexibility, economy, and reliable metrics. You may not know
that Google collects near real-time data from millions of anonymous set-top boxes,
helping you know what is working and not working. Google TV Ads’ online auction
model allows you to set your own maximum prices, with your actual price paid for a
winning bid that of the next highest bidder. You can use the TV Ads interface to buy
Figure 14-11. Choose “Click-to-play video” to create a video ad
396 | Chapter 14: AdWords beyond CPC

just the placements you want, without bundling, and to adjust your placements on the
fly when you determine what works and what doesn’t.
As you can see in Figure 14-14, Google is able to place your ads on many television
content providers with tremendous granular flexibility regarding when the ad runs.
If you look on the Campaign Management tab (shown in Fig-
ure 14-15), you may see a link for Audio Ad Library. The audio ad library
functions in much the same way as the market for TV ads, except that
it is a radio advertising platform. However, as of mid-2009, Google is
discontinuing the placement of radio ads.

Action Items
For almost any kind of ad you need to place, Google provides essentially self-service
mechanisms that help you assemble, target, and analyze the results. This represents a
radical restructuring of advertising as we know it, and the philosophy behind Google’s
core web businesses have been applied to more traditional advertising as well.
To take advantage of Google’s offerings:
• Create and target interactive image-based advertising
• Take advantage of Google’s extensive gallery of direct mail, interactive, seasonal,
and industry-specific visual ad templates
• If appropriate to your business, create and target a mobile advertising campaign
• Create and target click-to-play video advertisements

The animal on the cover of Google Advertising Tools, Second Edition, is a white-headed
capuchin monkey (Cebus capucinus). The capuchin monkey is named after the
Capuchin order of monks because the color of its head is said to resemble the monk’s
cowl. Native to parts of Central and South America, capuchin monkeys can be found
in a range of habitats, including rain forests, mangrove forests, and wooded areas.
Traveling in groups of 6 to 20 monkeys, capuchins spend much of their day foraging
for food. While they prefer fruit, capuchins will also eat leaves, nuts, flowers, insects,
spiders, and sometimes small birds and lizards. Because food can be scarce, capuchins
have to come up with creative ways to feed themselves. For example, they have been
observed using tools to crack open the tough nuts of shells and teaching their offspring
how to use these tools.
Scientists postulate that the challenges these monkeys face in procuring food has helped
develop their brains. Capuchins’ high intelligence and small size make them good pets,
and they are sometimes trained to act as assistants to paraplegic people. Most famously,
perhaps, the capuchin monkey is the traditional companion of the organ grinder.
