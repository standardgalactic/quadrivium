Comments
●
Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the 
physical line;
●
 A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not 
within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character;
●
Comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python;
●
It’s a very good practice to use comments to document your code;
●
In PyCharm Ctr + / is used to comment out an entire block of code;
Examples:
>>> #this is a comment
>>> # a = 5, this line is another comment
>>> x = 9 #here I create a variable called x that stores an integer (9)
