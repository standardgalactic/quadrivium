The following information is for FCC compliance of Class A devices: This equipment has been tested and 
found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC rules. These limits 
are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a 
commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio-frequency energy and, if not 
installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio 
communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference, in 
which case users will be required to correct the interference at their own expense.  

 
 
The following information is for FCC compliance of Class B devices: The equipment described in this manual 
generates and may radiate radio-frequency energy. If it is not installed in accordance with Cisco’s installation 
instructions, it may cause interference with radio and television reception. This equipment has been tested and 
found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device in accordance with the specifications in part 15 of 
the FCC rules. These specifications are designed to provide reasonable protection against such interference in a 
residential installation. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular 
installation.  
You can determine whether your equipment is causing interference by turning it off. If the interference stops, it 
was probably caused by the Cisco equipment or one of its peripheral devices. If the equipment causes 
interference to radio or television reception, try to correct the interference by using one or more of the 
following measures: 
• Turn the television or radio antenna until the interference stops. 
• Move the equipment to one side or the other of the television or radio. 
• Move the equipment farther away from the television or radio. 
• Plug the equipment into an outlet that is on a different circuit from the television or radio. (That is, make 
certain the equipment and the television or radio are on circuits controlled by different circuit breakers or 
fuses.)

Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 
6-3 
Overview  
53 
The network layer is responsible for navigating data through a network. The 
54 
function of the network layer is to find the best path through a network. Devices use 
55 
the network-layer addressing scheme to determine the destination of data as it 
56 
moves through the network. This module examines IP addressing and the five 
57 
classes of IP address along with subnetworks and subnet masks, and their roles in IP 
58 
addressing schemes.  
59 
 
60 
In addition, this module discusses the difference between routing and routed 
61 
protocols and how routers track distance between locations. Finally, this module 
62 
introduces the distance-vector, link-state, and hybrid routing approaches and how 
63 
each resolves common routing problems. 
64 
 
65 
Upon completing this module, you will be able to: 
66 
 
67 
I 
Explain the format and significance of each of the following components of 
68 
an IP network: IP address, IP address classes, reserved IP address space, and 
69 
IP subnetting 
70 
I 
Calculate valid IP subnetwork addresses and mask values such that 
71 
user/network requirements are met when given an IP address scheme  
72 
I 
Describe the differences between static and dynamic routing, and between 
73 
distance-vector and link-state routing protocols, including convergence 
74 
I 
Describe the differences between interior and exterior routing protocols 
75 
I 
Explain the purpose and ideal environments for the following routing 
76 
protocols: Routing Information Protocol versions 1 and 2 (RIPv1 and 
77 
RIPv2), Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), Enhanced IGRP 
78 
(EIGRP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Intermediate System-to-
79 
Intermediate System (IS-IS), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)  
80 
I 
Explain how MPLS fuses the intelligence of routing with the performance 
81 
of switching and provides significant benefits to networks with a pure IP 
82 
architecture as well as those with IP and ATM

6.1.1 IP Addressing 
117 
Figure 1: Network and Host Addresses  
118 
 
119 
 
120 
In a TCP/IP environment, end stations communicate with servers or other end 
121 
stations. This can occur because each node using the TCP/IP protocol suite has a 
122 
unique 32-bit logical address. This address is known as the IP address. IP addressing 
123 
is a hierarchical addressing. An IP address has two parts:  
124 
 
125 
I 
The network-address component (network ID) 
126 
I 
The host-address component (host ID) 
127 
Together, those two parts of addresses could uniquely identify any and all devices 
128 
connected via the Internet. It is the unique combination of both the host and network 
129 
addresses that make it possible to access any given host in an internetwork. IP 
130 
addresses are like postal mail addresses, which describe a person’s location by 
131 
providing a country, a state, a city, a street, and a street number. IP packet is like an 
132 
envelope containing the information a user wants to send, outside the envelope, we 
133 
need an address for delivery. 
134 
 
135 
ZIP codes and network IDs are quite similar in how they work. A ZIP code enables 
136 
the postal system to direct your mail to your local post office and to your 
137 
neighborhood. From there, the street address directs the carrier to the proper 
138 
destination.  
139 
 
140 
For example: 
141 
If you have a mail that is addressed to “150 Tasman Drive, Los Angeles, CA 
142 
90210”, the ZIP code 90210 will direct the mail to a local post office in Los Angels, 
143 
CA. Then, the street address “150 Tasman Drive” will be used by the carrier to 
144 
deliver the letter to the proper house. 
145 
 
146 
Network-address portion = ZIP Code (90210) 
147

Host-address portion = Street address (123 Networking Drive) 
148 
 
149 
A network address helps the router identify a path within the network. The router 
150 
uses the network address to identify the destination network of a packet within an 
151 
internetwork.  
152 
 
153 
In addition to the network address, network protocols use host address. The host 
154 
address refers to the device port on the network. From some network layer 
155 
protocols, a network administrator assigns host addresses according to some 
156 
predetermined network-addressing plan. For other network layer protocols, 
157 
assigning host addresses is partially or completely dynamic or automatic. 
158 
 
159 
Figure [1] shows three devices in Network 1 (two workstations and a router), each 
160 
with its own unique host address. Figure [1] also shows that the router is connected 
161 
to two other networks, networks 2 and 3. 
162

network to groups of IP-addressed end systems. Therefore, there isn’t a need to 
188 
allocate octets or bits of the address to separate network and host addresses.

Note  
204 
* Technically speaking, 127 (011111111) is a Class A address. However, it is 
205 
reserved and cannot be used for network address. 
206 
 
207 
IP addresses are globally unique, 32-bit numbers. Globally unique addresses permit 
208 
IP networks anywhere in the world to communicate with each other. For simplicity 
209 
and clarity, these bits are normally represented as four sets of octets (8 bits [or 1 
210 
byte ] per octet). Each octet is then represented as a decimal number between 0 and 
211 
255 and separated by a period, or dot. This scenario is known as dotted-decimal 
212 
notation. As shown in Figure [1], the IP address 
213 
100001001010001110000000000010001 can be written as 132.163.128.17 and 
214 
spoken as “132 dot 163 dot 128 dot 17”. 
215 
 
216 
To accommodate different size networks and aid in classifying them, IP addresses 
217 
are divided into categories called classes. This scenario is known as classful 
218 
addressing. Each IP address is broken down into a network address (or network 
219 
identifier, network ID) and the host address (or host identifier, host ID). A bit or bit 
220 
sequence at the start of each address determines the class of the address. There are 
221 
five IP address classes (see Figure [2]). 
222 
 
223 
Class A 
224 
The Class A address was designed to support extremely large networks. A Class A 
225 
IP address uses only the first octet to indicate the network address. The remaining 
226 
three octets enumerate host addresses.  
227 
 
228 
The first bit of a Class A address is always “0”. With that first bit a 0, the lowest 
229 
number that can be represented is 00000000 (decimal 0), and the highest number 
230 
that can be represented is 01111111 (decimal 127). However, these two numbers, 0 
231 
and 127, are reserved and cannot be used as a network address. Any address that 
232 
starts with a value between 0 and 126 in the first octet is a Class A address.  
233 
 
234 
Note: The 127.0.0.0 network is reserved for loopback testing (Routers or local 
235 
machines can use this address to send packets to themselves). Therefore, it cannot 
236 
be assigned to a network. 
237 
 
238 
Class B 
239 
The Class B address was designed to support the needs of moderate- to large-sized 
240 
networks. A Class B IP address uses two of the four octets to indicate the network 
241 
address. The other two octets specify host addresses.  
242 
 
243 
The first 2 bits of the first octet of a Class B address are always “10”. The 
244 
remaining 6 bits may be populated with either 1s or 0s. Therefore, the lowest 
245 
number that can be represented with a Class B address is 10000000 (decimal 128), 
246 
and the highest number that can be represented is 10111111 (decimal 191). Any 
247

Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 
6-9 
address that starts with a value in the range of 128 to 191 in the first octet is a Class 
248 
B address.  
249 
Class C 
250 
The Class C address space is the most commonly used of the original address 
251 
classes. This address space was intended to support a lot of small networks.  
252 
 
253 
A Class C address begins with binary “110”. Therefore, the lowest number that can 
254 
be represented is 11000000 (decimal 192), and the highest number that can be 
255 
represented is 11011111 (decimal 223). If an address contains a number in the range 
256 
of 192 to 223 in the first octet, it is a Class C address.  
257 
 
258 
Class D 
259 
The Class D address class was created to enable multicasting in an IP address. A 
260 
multicast address is a unique network address that directs packets with that 
261 
destination address to predefined groups of IP addresses. Therefore, a single station 
262 
can simultaneously transmit a single stream of datagrams to multiple recipients.  
263 
 
264 
The Class D address space, much like the other address spaces, is mathematically 
265 
constrained. The first 4 bits of a Class D address must be “1110”. Therefore, the 
266 
first octet range for Class D addresses is 11100000 to 11101111, or 224 to 239. And 
267 
IP address that starts with a value in the range of 224 to 239 in the first octet is a 
268 
Class D address. 
269 
 
270 
Class E 
271 
A Class E address has been defined. However, it is reserved by IETF for its own 
272 
research. Therefore, no Class E addresses have been released for use in the Internet. 
273 
The first 4 bit of a Class E address are always set to 1s. Therefore, the first octet 
274 
range for Class D addresses is 11110000 to 11111111, or 240 to 255.  
275 
 
276 
Figure [3] illustrates the octets used as network-address parts and host-address parts 
277 
for Class A, B, and C IP addresses. Figure [4] shows the IP address range for each 
278 
IP address class.

6.1.3 Reserved Address Space 
299 
Figure 1: Network Address 
300 
 
301 
 
302 
If your computer wanted to communicate with of the devices on a network, it would 
303 
be quite unmanageable to write out the IP address for each device. You might try 
304 
two hyphenated addresses, indicating that you are referring to all devices within a 
305 
range of numbers, but that, too, would be quite unmanageable. Fortunately, there is 
306 
a shorter method. 
307 
 
308 
Network Address 
309 
An IP address that has binary 0s in all host bit positions is reserved for the network 
310 
address. Therefore, as a Class A network example, 113.0.0.0 is the IP address of the 
311 
network containing the host 113.1.2.3. A router uses a network’s IP address when it 
312 
forwards data on the Internet. As a Class B network example, the IP address 
313 
176.10.0.0 is a network address, as shown in Figure [1]. 
314 
 
315 
The decimal numbers that fill the first two octets in a Class B network address are 
316 
assigned. The last two octets contain 0s because those 16 bits are for host numbers 
317 
and are used for devices that are attached to the network. The IP address in the 
318 
example (176.10.0.0) is reserved for the network address; it is never be used as an 
319 
address for any device that is attached to it. An example of the IP address for a 
320 
device on 176.10.0.0 network would be 176.10.16.1. In this example, “176.10” is 
321 
the network-address portion and “16.1” is the host-address portion. 
322 
 
323 
Broadcast Address  
324 
If you wanted to send data to all the devices on a network, you would need to use a 
325 
broadcast address. A broadcast occurs when a source sends out data to all devices 
326 
on a network. To ensure that all of the devices on the network pay attention to the 
327 
broadcast, the sender must use a destination IP address that all of them can 
328 
recognize and pick up. Broadcast IP addresses end with binary 1s in the entire host 
329 
part of the address (the host field). 
330 
 
331 
For the network in the example (176.10.0.0), in which the last 16 bits make up the 
332 
host field (or host part of the address), the broadcast that would be sent out to all 
333 
devices on that network would include a destination address of 176.10.255.255 
334 
(because 255 is the decimal value of an octet containing 11111111). 
335 
 
336 
A broadcast address is quite similar to a bulk postal mailing. The ZIP code directs 
337 
the mail to the appropriate area, and the broadcast address of “Current Resident” 
338 
further directs the mail to every address. An IP broadcast address uses the same 
339 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-11 
concept. The network number designates the segment, and the rest of the address 
340 
tells every IP host in that network that this is a broadcast message and that the 
341 
device needs to pay attention to the message. All devices on a network recognize 
342 
their own host IP address as well as the broadcast address for their network. 
343 
 
344 
Network ID 
345 
It is important to understand the significance of the network portion of an IP 
346 
address, which is referred to as the network ID. Hosts on a network can 
347 
communicate directly only with devices that have the same network ID. They might 
348 
share the same physical segment, but if they have different network numbers, they 
349 
usually cannot communicate with each other—unless there is another device that 
350 
can make a connection between the networks. 
351 
 
352 
A network ID enables a router to put a packet onto the appropriate network 
353 
segment. The host ID helps the router deliver the Layer 2 frame encapsulating the 
354 
packet to a specific host on the network. As a result, the host ID is mapped to the 
355 
correct MAC address, which is needed by the Layer 2 process on the router to create 
356 
the frame. 
357 
 
358 
Hosts for Classes of IP Addresses 
359 
Each class of network allows a fixed number of hosts. In a Class A network, the 
360 
first octet is assigned, leaving the last three octets (24 bits) to be assigned to hosts. 
361 
Remember that the first host address in each network (all 0s) is reserved for the 
362 
actual network address (or network number), and the final host address in each 
363 
network (all 1s) is reserved for broadcasts. The maximum number of hosts in a 
364 
Class A network is 224 – 2 (subtracting the network and broadcast reserved 
365 
addresses), or 16,777,214 hosts. 
366 
 
367 
In a Class B network, the first two octets are assigned, leaving the final two octets 
368 
(16 bits) to be assigned to hosts. The maximum number of hosts in a Class B 
369 
network is 216 – 2, or 65,534 hosts. In a Class C network, the first three octets are 
370 
assigned. This leaves the final octet (8 bits) to assign to hosts, so the maximum 
371 
number of hosts is 28 – 2, or 254 hosts.

6.1.4 Private Addresses 
383 
Figure 1: Private IP Addresses 
384 
 
385 
 
386 
The Internet's stability directly depends on the uniqueness of publicly used network 
387 
addresses. Therefore, some mechanism was needed to ensure that addresses were, in 
388 
fact, unique. This responsibility originally rested within an organization known as 
389 
the InterNIC (Internet Network Information Center). This organization is now 
390 
defunct and has been succeeded by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
391 
(IANA). IANA carefully manages the remaining supply of IP addresses to ensure 
392 
that duplication of publicly used addresses does not occur. Such duplication would 
393 
cause instability in the Internet and compromise its capability to deliver datagrams 
394 
to networks using the duplicated addresses. 
395 
 
396 
Public IP Addresses 
397 
Public IP addresses are unique. No two machines that connect to a public network 
398 
can have the same IP number. This is because public IP numbers are global and 
399 
standardized, and all machines connected to the Internet agree to adhere to the 
400 
system. Both the Class A and Class B address space is completely allocated. Of the 
401 
remaining Class C networks, less than half remain, meaning that only six percent of 
402 
the available IP space remains. 
403 
 
404 
Private IP Addresses 
405 
As stated above, Internet hosts require a globally unique IP addresses. However, 
406 
private hosts that are not connected to the Internet can use any valid address, as long 
407 
as it is unique within the private network. Because many private networks exist 
408 
alongside public networks, grabbing “just any address” is strongly discouraged. 
409 
RFC 1918 sets aside three blocks of IP addresses (i.e., a Class A, a Class B, and a 
410 
Class C range) for private, internal use. Addresses in this range will not be routed 
411 
on the Internet backbone (see Figure [1]). Internet routers immediately discard 
412 
private addresses. 
413 
 
414 
If you are addressing a nonpublic intranet, a test lab, or a home network, these 
415 
private addresses can be used instead of globally unique addresses. Global addresses 
416 
must be obtained from a provider or a registry at some expense. 
417

When TCP/IP was first introduced in the 1980s, it relied on a two-level addressing 
432 
scheme, which at the time offered adequate scalability. Unfortunately, the architects 
433 
of TCP/IP could not have predicted that their protocol would eventually sustain a 
434 
global network of information, commerce, and entertainment. Twenty years ago, IP 
435 
version 4 (IPv4) offered an addressing strategy that, although scalable for a time, 
436 
resulted in an inefficient allocation of addresses.  
437 
 
438 
The Class A and B addresses make up 75 percent of the IPv4 address space, but a 
439 
relative handful of organizations (fewer than 17,000) can be assigned a Class A or B 
440 
network number. Class C network addresses are far more numerous than Class A 
441 
and Class B addresses, although they account for only 12.5 percent of the possible 4 
442 
billion (232) IP hosts, as shown in the Figure [1].  
443 
 
444 
Unfortunately, Class C addresses are limited to 254 hosts, which will not meet the 
445 
needs of larger organizations that cannot acquire a Class A or B address. Even if

there were more Class A, B, and C addresses, too many network addresses would 
447 
cause Internet routers to grind to a halt under the weight of enormous routing tables. 
448 
 
449 
As early as 1992, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) identified two specific 
450 
concerns: 
451 
 
452 
I 
Exhaustion of the remaining, unassigned IPv4 network addresses. At the 
453 
time, the Class B space was on the verge of depletion.  
454 
I 
The rapid and substantial increase in the size of the Internet's routing tables 
455 
is because of its growth. As more Class C's came online, the resulting flood 
456 
of new network information threatened Internet routers' capability to cope 
457 
effectively. 
458 
Over the past two decades, numerous extensions to IPv4 have been developed that 
459 
are specifically designed to improve the efficiency with which the 32-bit address 
460 
space can be used. Two of the more important of these are subnet masks and 
461 
classless interdomain routing (CIDR), which will be discussed in more details in the 
462 
following section and next lesson. 
463 
 
464 
Meanwhile, an even more extendible and scalable version of IP, IP version 6 (IPv6), 
465 
has been defined and developed. IPv6 uses 128 bits rather than the 32 bits currently 
466 
used in IPv4. IPv6 uses hexadecimal numbers, as seen in Figure [2], to represent the 
467 
128 bits. It will provide 16 billion billion IP addresses (3.4 x 1038 addresses). This 
468 
version of IP should provide sufficient addresses for our future needs. 
469 
 
470 
After years of planning and development, IPv6 promises to be ready for wide-scale 
471 
implementation. IPv6 is slowly being implemented in select networks. Eventually, 
472 
IPv6 may replace IPv4 as the Internet's dominant protocol.

6.1.6 CIDR 
484 
Figure 1: Addressing with CIDR  
485 
 
486 
 
487 
As you learned in previous section, the original IPv4 defines IP addresses in five 
488 
major classes of address structure, Classes A through E. Using IPv4, the Internet 
489 
was running out of address space very quickly.  
490 
 
491 
Classless interdomain routing (CIDR) is a new addressing scheme for the Internet 
492 
that allows for more efficient allocation of IP addresses than the old Class A, B, and 
493 
C address scheme. 
494 
 
495 
First introduced in 1993 by RFCs 1517, 1518, 1519, and 1520, and later deployed in 
496 
1994, CIDR dramatically improves scalability and efficiency of IPv4 by providing 
497 
the following: 
498 
 
499 
I 
The replacement of classful addressing with a more flexible and less 
500 
wasteful classless scheme 
501 
I 
Enhanced route aggregation, also known as supernetting. As the Internet 
502 
grow, routers on the Internet requires huge memory tables to stores all the 
503 
routing information. Supernetting helps reduce the size of the router’s 
504 
memory tables by combining/summarizing multiple routing information 
505 
entries into one single entry. This reduces the size of the router’s memory 
506 
table that also allows for faster table lookup. 
507 
A CIDR network address looks like this: 
508 
 
509 
 
207.21.54.0/23 
510 
 
511 
The “207.21.54.0” is the network address itself and the “23” means that the first 23 
512 
bits are the network part of the address, leaving the last 9 bits for specific host 
513 
addresses. 
514 
 
515 
Using CIDR, company XYZ asks for an address block from its Internet service 
516 
provider (ISP), not a central authority. The ISP assesses XYZ's needs and allocates 
517 
address space from its own large “CIDR block” of addresses. Providers assume the 
518 
burden of managing address space in a classless system. With this system, Internet 
519 
routers keep only one summary route, or supernet route, to the provider's network, 
520 
and only the individual provider keeps routes that are more specific to its own 
521

Summary 
532 
This section summarizes the key points you learned in this lesson. 
533 
 
534 
I 
Network addresses consist of two parts: the network portion and the host 
535 
portion. IPv4 addresses have 32 bits and are generally shown in dotted 
536 
decimal form: 132.17.141.19. 
537 
I 
IPv4 addresses are divided primarily into A, B, C classes. Other classes (D 
538 
and E) exist, but are reserved for special uses (multicasting and research). 
539 
Addressing space as defined by IPv4 is limited and has been mostly 
540 
exhausted. 
541 
I 
When written in a binary format, the first bit of a Class A address is always 
542 
0, the first 2 bits of a Class B address are always 10, and the first 3 bits of a 
543 
Class C address are always 110. 
544 
I 
The more flexible IPv6 will replace IPv4 in the near future. IPv6 offers 128 
545 
bits of addressing compared to the 32-bit addressing available in IPv4. 
546 
I 
Classless interdomain routing (CIDR) is an addressing scheme for the 
547 
Internet that allows for more efficient allocation of IP addresses than the old 
548 
Class A, B, and C address scheme.

The Internet’s original two-level hierarchy (network ID and host ID) assumed that 
596 
each site would have only a single network. Therefore, each site would need only a 
597 
single connection to the Internet. Initially, these were safe assumptions. Over time, 
598 
however, network computing matured and expanded. By 1985, it was no longer safe 
599 
to assume that an organization would have only a single network, nor that it would 
600 
be satisfied with a single connection to the Internet. 
601 
 
602 
As sites began to develop multiple networks, it became obvious to the IETF that 
603 
some mechanism was needed to differentiate among the multiple logical networks 
604 
that were emerging as subsets of the Internet’s second tier. Otherwise, there could 
605 
be no efficient way to route data to specific end systems in sites with multiple 
606 
networks. This is illustrated in Figure [1]. 
607 
 
608 
One answer was to give each logical network, or subnetwork, its own IP address 
609 
range. This would work but would be a tremendously inefficient use of the IP 
610 
address space. It wouldn’t take very long for this approach to completely consume 
611 
the remaining unassigned IP address ranges. A more immediate impact was the 
612 
expansion of routing tables in the Internet’s routers. Each network would require its 
613 
own routing table entry. Clearly, a better approach was needed. 
614 
 
615 
The answer was to organize these logical networks hierarchically and to route 
616 
between them. From the Internet’s perspective, sites with multiple logical networks 
617 
should be treated as a single network. Therefore, they would share a common IP 
618 
address range. However, they would need their own unique range of subnetwork 
619 
numbers. 
620 
 
621 
Network administrators sometimes need to divide networks, especially large ones, 
622 
into smaller networks. These smaller divisions are called subnetworks and provide 
623 
addressing flexibility. Normally, subnetworks are simply referred to as subnets. The 
624 
concept of subnetting is based on the need for a third level in the Internet’s 
625 
addressing hierarchy. As internetworking technologies matured, their acceptance 
626 
and use increased dramatically. As a result, it became common for moderate- and 
627 
large-sized organizations to have multiple networks.  
628 
 
629 
In such multiple-network environments, each subnetwork connected to the 
630 
Internet via a common point: a router (see Figure [2]). The actual details of the 
631 
internal network environment are inconsequential to the Internet.  
632 
 
633 
Because the subnet address is taken from the host number portion of Class A, Class 
634 
B, and Class C addresses, it is assigned locally, usually by the network 
635 
administrator. Also, like the other ports of IP addresses, each subnet address must 
636 
be unique (see Figure [3]). 
637 
 
638 
The idea to subnet a network is very similar to the street address of a multilevel 
639 
building. For example, in a 2-story building, there are 9 cubes in each floor. The 
640 
street address of the first and second floor cube number 9 can be written as below. 
641 
The street number “150 Tasman Drive” can be think as the network address. The 
642 
floor number would be the subnet, and the cube number would be the host address. 
643 
 
644 
150 Tasman Drive, 1st Floor, Cube 9 
645 
Network Address = 150 Tasman Drive 
646 
Subnet = 1st Floor 
647 
Host Address = Cube 9

684 
As stated in previous section, subnet addresses include the Class A, Class B, or 
685 
Class C network portion, plus a subnet field and a host field. The subnet field and 
686 
the host field are created from the original host portion for the entire network. The 
687 
ability to decide how to divide the original host portion into the new subnet and host 
688 
fields provides addressing flexibility for the network administrator. 
689 
 
690 
To create a subnet address, a network administrator borrows bits from the original 
691 
host portion and designates them as the subnet field. The minimum number of bits 
692 
that can be borrowed is 2.  
693 
 
694 
If you were to borrow only 1 bit to create a subnet, then you would have only the 
695 
networks with all zeros and all ones as the subnet bits. These are generally 
696 
prohibited by RFC convention (RFC 950). If we were to use a subnet of all zeros, 
697 
then there would be no distinction between the major network and the subnet. Since 
698 
they would be referred to the same way, this would cause confusion. Similarly a 
699 
subnet that had subnet bits of all ones, would have the same broadcast address as the 
700 
major network. When a system attempted to broadcast to this subnet, it would be the 
701 
equipment of a broadcast to the full network. The maximum number of bits that can 
702 
be borrowed can be any number that leaves at least 2 bits remaining, for the host 
703 
number. 
704 
 
705 
Subnets are concealed from outside networks by using masks referred to as subnet 
706 
masks. The subnet mask is not an address. The function of a subnet mask is to tell 
707 

6-24 
Cisco Certified Network Associate Basics (CCNAB) v2.0 
Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
devices which part of an address is the network number, including the subnet, and 
708 
which part is the host. 
709 
 
710 
Subnet masks use the same format as IP addresses. In other words, each is 32 bits 
711 
long and is divided into four octets. Subnet masks have all 1s in the network and 
712 
subnetwork portion, and all 0s in the host portion (see Figure [1]).  
713 
 
714 
By default, if no bits are borrowed to represent a subnet, the default subnet mask for 
715 
class A, B and C networks are as follows: 
716 
 
717 
Class A 
Default Subnet Mask = 255.0.0.0 
718 
Class B 
Default Subnet Mask = 255.255.0.0 
719 
Class C 
Default Subnet Mask = 255.255.255.0 
720 
 
721 
To determine the subnet mask for a particular subnetwork IP address, follow these 
722 
steps: 
723 
 
724 
Step 1 
Express the subnetwork IP address in binary form. 
725 
Step 2  
Replace the network and subnet portion of the address with all 1s. 
726 
Step 3  
Replace the host portion of the address with all 0s. 
 
727 
Step 4  
Convert the binary expression back to dotted-decimal notation. 
728 
 
729 
In the Class C IP address example shown in Figure [2], 3 bits from the original host 
730 
field have been borrowed for the subnet field, leaving the 5 remaining bits for the 
731 
new host field.  
732 
 
733 
As an illustration, given a class B network address, if 8 bits were borrowed to 
734 
represent a subnet, the subnet mask for the same Class B network would be 
735 
255.255.255.0, as shown in Figure [3] and Figure [4]. 
736 
 
737 
To create subnets, you must extend the routing portion of the address. That means 
738 
you need to borrow bits from the host field. However, the number of bits to be 
739 
borrowed depends on both of the following requirements: 
740 
 
741 
• 
How many sub-networks are required 
742 
• 
How many hosts are required on each sub-network 
743 
 
744 
Because there are three octets in the host field of a Class A network, up to 22 bits 
745 
can be borrowed in Class A networks to create subnetworks. (Remember that the 
746 
maximum number of bits that can be borrowed can be any number that leaves at 
747 
least 2 bits remaining, for the host number.)  
748 
 
749 
A Class B network has two octets in the host field. Therefore, up to 14 bits can be 
750 
borrowed to create subnetworks.  
751 
 
752 
A Class C network has only one octet in the host field. Therefore, up to only 6 bits 
753 
can be borrowed in Class C networks to create subnetworks. 
754 
 
755 
The subnet field always immediately follows the network number. That is, the 
756 
borrowed bits must be the first n bits of the default host field, where n is the desired 
757 
size of the new subnet field (see Figure [5]). The subnet mask is the tool used by the 
758 
router to determine which bits are routing bits and which bits are host bits.

6.2.3 Network Addressing Planning 
776 
Figure 1: Network Addressing Planning  
777 
 
778 
The number of lost IP addresses with a Class C network depends on the number of 
779 
bits borrowed for subnetting. 
780 
 
781 
When you configure routers, you must connect each interface to a different network 
782 
segment. Each of these segments becomes a separate subnet. You must select an 
783 
address from each different subnet to assign to the interface of the router that 
784 
connects to that subnet. Each segment of a network—the actual wires and links—
785 
must have different network/subnet numbers.  
786 
 
787 
One of the decisions that you must make whenever you create subnets is to 
788 
determine the optimal number of subnets and hosts (see Figure [1]). When you 
789 
create subnets, you lose many potential addresses. For this reason, network 
790 
administrators must pay close attention to the percentage of addresses that they lose 
791 
by creating subnets. 
792 
 
793 
Computing Usable Subnetworks 
794 
Whenever you borrow bits from the host field, it is important to note the number of 
795 
additional subnets that are being created each time you borrow one more bit. You 
796 
have already learned that you cannot borrow only 1 bit; the fewest you may borrow 
797 
is 2 bits. Borrowing 2 bits creates four possible subnets (22) (but remember that 
798 
there are always two reserved/unusable subnets (all 0’s and all 1’s subnet). Each 
799 
time you borrow another bit from the host field, the number of subnets created 
800 
increases by a power of 2.  
801 
 
802 
For example: 
803 
Using 3 bits for the subnet field will result in having 8 possible subnets, 6 of which 
804 
are useable. (23 = 8, 8 – 2 unuseable subnets = 6 usable subnets). 
805 
 
806 
Using 4 bits for the subnet field will result in having 16 possible subnets, 14 of 
807 
which are useable. (24 = 16, 16 – 2 unuseable subnets = 14 usable subnets). 
808 
 
809 
In general, the following formula can be used to calculate the number of usable 
810 
subnets given the number of subnet bits used. 
811 
 
812 
Number of subnets = 2n – 2  (where n is the number of subnet bits) 
813 
 
814 
 
815 
Number of Hosts 
per Subnet

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-27 
 
816 
Computing Hosts per Subnetwork 
817 
Each time you borrow 1 bit from a host field, there is 1 less bit remaining in the host 
818 
field that can be used for host numbers and the number of host addresses that you 
819 
can assign decreases by a power of 2. 
820 
  
821 
To help you understand how this works, consider a Class C network address as an 
822 
example. If there is no subnet mask, all 8 bits in the last octet are used for the host 
823 
field. Therefore, there are 256 (28) possible addresses available to assign to hosts 
824 
(254 useable addresses, after you subtract the 2 addresses [the broadcast and the 
825 
subnet address] which you cannot use).  
826 
 
827 
Now, imagine that this Class C network is divided into subnets. If you borrow 2 bits 
828 
from the default 8-bit host field, the size of the host field decreases to 6 bits. If you 
829 
write out all the possible combinations of 0s and 1s that could occur in the 
830 
remaining 6 bits, you would discover that the total number of possible hosts that 
831 
could be assigned in each subnet would be reduced to 64 (26). The number of 
832 
useable host numbers would be reduced to 62.  
833 
 
834 
In the same Class C network, if you borrow 3 bits, the size of the host field 
835 
decreases to 5 bits and the total number of hosts that you could assign to each 
836 
subnet would be reduced to 32 (25). The number of useable host numbers would be 
837 
reduced to 30.  
838 
 
839 
The number of possible host addresses that can be assigned to a subnet is related to 
840 
the number of subnets that have been created. In a Class C network, for example, if 
841 
a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224 has been applied, then 3 bits (224 = 11100000) 
842 
would have been borrowed from the host field. The useable subnets created are 6 (8 
843 
minus 2), each having 30 (32 minus 2) useable host addresses. 
844 
 
845 
In general, the following formula can be used to calculate the number of usable host 
846 
addresses given the number of host bits used. 
847 
 
848 
Number of host address = 2n – 2  (where n is the number of host bits)

Imagine that you are a network administrator. Your company has a Class B network 
911 
address of 150.193.0.0. This class B network address will be subdivided to 
912 
accommodate your physical network, and you will need at least 12 subnets 
913 
interconnected with routers and each subnet needs to be capable of handling at least 
914 
750 hosts per subnet.  
915 
 
916 
Because you have a Class B network address, you have 16 bits in the third and 
917 
fourth octet available for a total of 65536 possible hosts. To create a custom subnet 
918 
mask, you will need to borrow bits from the host port of the address. The following 
919 
steps help accomplish this: 
920 
 
921 
1. The first step to “subnetting” is to determine how many subnets are needed.  
922 
 
923 
In this case you will need 12 subnetworks. To see how many bits you should 
924 
borrow from the host portion of the network address, add the bit values from 
925 
right to left until the total (decimal value) is greater than the number of subnets 
926 
you will need (see Figure [1]). Since we need 12 subnets, add the one bit 
927 
through the four bit, which equals 15. This is over the number of subnets we 
928 
need, so we will need to borrow at least four bits from the host address starting 
929 
from the left side of the octet that contains the host address.  
930 
 
931 
2. Once you know how many bits to borrow, you will borrow them from the left 
932 
side of the first octet of the host address (see Figure [2]).  
933 
 
934 
Remember that every bit you borrow from the host leaves fewer bits for the 
935 
hosts. Even though you increase the number of subnets, you decrease the 
936 
number of hosts per subnet. Since you need to borrow 2 bits from the left side, 
937 
you must show that new value in our subnet mask. Your existing default subnet 
938 
mask was 255.255.0.0 and your new “Custom” subnet mask is 255.255.240.0. 
939 
The 240 comes from the value of the first two bits from the left (128 + 64 + 32 
940 
+ 16 = 240). These bits now become 1s and are part of the overall subnet mask. 
941 
This leaves 12 bits for host IP addresses or 212 = 4096 hosts per subnet.  
942 
 
943 
3. With this information you can build the table shown in Figure [3].  
944 
 
945 
The first four bits are the subnet binary value. The last 12 bits are the host bits. 
946 
By borrowing 4 bits from the 16 bits of the host address you can create 16 
947 
subnets with 4096 hosts each. The 16 networks created are the “0”, “16”, “32”, 
948 
“48”, “64”, “80”, “96”, “112”, “128”, “144”, “160”, “176”, “192”, “208”, 
949 
“224”, and, “240” nets. The “0” net and the “252” net are considered unusable. 
950 
This is because the “0” net has all zeros (00000000) in the subnet portion of the 
951 
address and the “240” net has all ones (11110000) in the subnet portion of the 
952 
address. 
953 
 
954 
Notice that the first subnet always starts at 0 and, in this case, increases by 16, 
955 
which is the number of hosts on each subnet. One way to determine the number 
956 
of hosts on each subnet or the start of each subnet is to take the remaining host 
957 
bits to the power of 2. Since we borrowed four of the 8 bits in the third octet for 
958 
subnets and have 4 bits left, the number of hosts per subnet is 24 or 16. Another 
959 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-31 
way to figure the number of host per subnet or the “increment” from one subnet 
960 
to the next is to subtract the subnet mask value in decimal (240 in the third 
961 
octet) from 256 (which is maximum number of possible combinations of 8 bits) 
962 
which equals 16. This means you start at 0 for the first network and add 16 for 
963 
each additional subnetwork. If we take the second subnet (the 16 net) as an 
964 
example the IP address of 150.193.16.0 cannot be used for a host ID because it 
965 
is the “network ID” of the “16” subnet (host portion is all zeros). 
966 
 
967 
4. Once you have all the subnetwork addresses. You can determine the broadcast 
968 
address (see Figure [4]) and the ranges of possible host IP addresses for each 
969 
subnet. 
970 
 
971 
Let’s take the second subnet, 150.193.16.0 as an example. By borrowing 4 bits 
972 
from the host field, the last12 bits left in the third and fourth octets are the host 
973 
bits. As you learned earlier, the broadcast address has all the 1s in the host port. 
974 
As shown in Figure [4], when you place all 1s in the host bits, the broadcast 
975 
address for 150.193.16.0 network is 150.193.31.255. 
976 
 
977 
5. Now that you know the broadcast for the 150.193.16.0 network, you are ready 
978 
to determine the host range of this network.  
979 
 
980 
Since 150.193.16.0 has all the 0s in the host portion, it is a subnetwork address. 
981 
The first usage host address of this subnetwork would be 150.193.16.1 
982 
(10010110.11000001.00010000.00000001). The last host address of this 
983 
subnetwork would be 150.193.31.255 
984 
(10010110.11000001.00011111.11111111). However, this address will be used 
985 
as broadcast address. Therefore, the last usable host address would be 
986 
150.193.31.254 (10010110.11000001.00011111.11111110). Therefore, the host 
987 
range of 150.193.16.0 network is 150.193.16.1 - 150.193.31.254. 
988 
 
989 
Figure [5] shows an example of a Class B IP network that has 8 bits of subnetting 
990 
that provide up to 254 subnets and 254 host addresses. 
991 
 
992 
Figure [6] is an example of a table used for Class B subnet planning. 
993 
 
994 
Now that you have learned how to calculate subnetwork addresses and mask for 
995 
Class B address. The lab activity below will provide you with a chance to practice

1052 
Now that you have learned how to subnetting a Class B network address in last 
1053 
section. In this section, you will work on a Class C network address.  
1054 
 
1055 
Imagine that you are a network administrator. Your company has a Class B network 
1056 
address of 200.10.57.0. You want to subdivide your network into 3 subnets and you 
1057 
need at least 20 hosts per subnet.   
1058 
 
1059 
Because you have a Class C network address, you have 8 bits in the fourth octet 
1060 
available for a total of 256 possible hosts. To create a custom subnet mask, you will 
1061 
need to borrow bits from the host port of the address. The following steps help 
1062 
accomplish this: 
1063 
 
1064 
1. The first step to subnetting is to determine how many subnets are needed. In this 
1065 
case you will need 3 subnets. To see how many bits you should borrow from the 
1066 
host portion of the network address, add the bit values from right to left until the 
1067 
total (decimal value) is greater than the number of subnets you will need. Since 
1068 
we need 3 subnets, add the one bit through the three bit, which equals 7. This is 
1069 
over the number of subnets we need, so we will need to borrow at least three 
1070 
bits from the host address starting from the left side of the octet that contains the 
1071 
host address (see Figure [1]).  
1072 
 
1073 
2. Once you know how many bits to borrow, you will borrow them from the left 
1074 
side of the first octet of the host address. Remember that every bit you borrow 
1075 
from the host leaves fewer bits for the hosts. Since you need to borrow 3 bits 
1076 
from the left side, you must show that new value in your subnet mask. The 
1077 
default subnet mask for Class C network address is 255.255.255.0 and your new 
1078 

6-34 
Cisco Certified Network Associate Basics (CCNAB) v2.0 
Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
“Custom” subnet mask is 255.255.255.224. The 224 comes from the value of 
1079 
the first three bits from the left (128 + 64 + 32 = 224). These bits now become 
1080 
1s and are part of the overall subnet mask. This leaves 5 bits for host IP 
1081 
addresses or 25 = 32 hosts per subnet (see Figure [2]). 
1082 
 
1083 
3. With this information you can build the table shown in Figure [3].  
1084 
 
1085 
The first three bits are the Subnet binary value. The last 5 bits are the host bits. 
1086 
By borrowing 3 bits from the 8 bits of the host address you can create 8 subnets 
1087 
with 32 hosts each. The 8 networks created are the “0”, “32”, “64”, “96”, “128”, 
1088 
“160”, “192”, and “224” nets. The “0” net and the “224” net are considered 
1089 
unusable. This is because the “0” net has all zeros (00000000) in the subnet 
1090 
portion of the address and the “224” net has all ones (11100000) in the subnet 
1091 
portion of the address. 
1092 
 
1093 
Notice that the first subnet always starts at 0 and, in this case, increases by 32, 
1094 
which is the number of hosts on each subnet. One way to determine the number 
1095 
of hosts on each subnet or the start of each subnet is to take the remaining host 
1096 
bits to the power of 2. Since we borrowed three of the 8 bits for subnets and 
1097 
have 5 bits left, the number of hosts per subnet is 25 or 32. Another way to 
1098 
figure the number of host per subnet or the “increment” from one subnet to the 
1099 
next is to subtract the subnet mask value in decimal (224 in the fourth octet) 
1100 
from 256 (which is maximum number of possible combinations of 8 bits) which 
1101 
equals 32. This means you start at 0 for the first network and add 16 for each 
1102 
additional subnetwork. If we take the second subnet (the 16 net) as an example 
1103 
the IP address of 200.10.57.0 cannot be used for a host ID because it is the 
1104 
“network ID” of the “16” subnet (host portion is all zeros). 
1105 
 
1106 
4. Once you have all the subnetwork addresses. You can determine the broadcast 
1107 
address (see Figure [4]) and the ranges of possible host IP addresses for each 
1108 
subnet. 
1109 
 
1110 
Let’s take the third subnet, 200.10.57.64 as an example. By borrowing 3 bits 
1111 
from the host field, the last 5 bits left in the third and fourth octets are the host 
1112 
bits. As you learned earlier, the broadcast address has all the 1s in the host port. 
1113 
As shown in Figure [4], when you place all 1s in the host bits, the broadcast 
1114 
address for 200.10.57.64 network is 200.10.57.95.

5. Now that you know the broadcast for the 200.10.57.64 network, you are ready 
1117 
to determine the host range of this network.  
1118 
 
1119 
Since 200.10.57.64 has all the 0s in the host portion, it is a subnetwork address. 
1120 
The first usage host address of this subnetwork would be 150.193.16.65 
1121 
(11001000.00001010.00111001.01000001). The last host address of this 
1122 
subnetwork would be 200.10.57.95 (11001000.00001010.00111001. 01011111). 
1123 
However, this address will be used as broadcast address. Therefore, the last 
1124 
usable host address would be 200.10.57.94 
1125 
(11001000.00001010.00111001.01011110). Therefore, the host range of 
1126 
150.193.16.64 network is 150.193.16.65 - 150.193.16.94.

1152 
Addresses 
1153 
Figure 1: Identifying Subnet, Broadcast, and Usable Addresses 
1154 
Subnet host address: 172.16.2.160  
   10101100.00010000.00000010.10100000 
1155

   11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 
1156 
Subnet address:  172.16.2.128         
   10101100.00010000.00000010.10000000 
1157 
Broadcast address: 172.16.2.191     
   10101100.00010000.00000010.10111111 
1158 
First usable host address:  172.16.2.129    10101100.00010000.00000010.10000001 
1159 
Last usable host address: 172.16.2.190     10101100.00010000.00000010.10111110 
1160 
 
1161 
If given an IP address and subnet mask, you should be able to use the information 
1162 
given to identify the subnet address, the broadcast address, and the range of the 
1163 
broadcast address.  
1164 
 
1165 
For example, you have a subnet host address 172.16.2.160 with 255.255.255.192 
1166 
subnet mask. The following steps will help you determine the subnet address, the 
1167 
broadcast address, and the range of the broadcast address. 
1168 
 
1169 
1. 
Write the 32-bit address in binary notation for 172.16.2.160, which would 
1170 
be 10101100.00010000.00000010.10100000. 
1171 
 
1172 
2. 
Then, write the 32-bit subnet mask 255.255.255.192 in binary just below, 
1173 
which would be 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000.  
1174 
 
1175 
As you learned earlier, the default subnet mask for a Class B address 
1176 
(without subnetting) is 255.255.0.0. To subnet a network, you need to 
1177 
borrow the bits from the host field. Those bits borrowed will become part 
1178 
of the network address. With the subnet mask 255.255.255.192 
1179 
(11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000), you can see that 10 bits in the 
1180 
third and fourth octets were in ones. It means that 10 bits were borrowed 
1181 
from the host field for subnetting.  
1182 
 
1183 
3. 
Now, look at the binary equivalent of the subnet host addresses you 
1184 
written down, 10101100.00010000.00000010.10100000. Now that you 
1185 
have known that the last 6 bits in the fourth octet is the host address and 
1186 
the subnet address has all the host fields in 0s. If you replace the last 6 bit 
1187 
to 0s, you would get 10101100.00010000.00000010.10000000, which 
1188 
will be the subnet address (172.16.2.128 in decimal).  
1189 
 
1190 
4. 
Once you have all the subnetwork addresses. You can determine the 
1191 
broadcast address. To determine the broadcast address, simple place all 
1192 
the 1s in the host field. In this example, the broadcast address will be 
1193 
10101100.00010000.00000010.10111111 (172.16.2.191 in decimal). 
1194 
 
1195 
5. 
Now that you know the broadcast for the 172.16.2.128 network, you are 
1196 
ready to determine the host range of this network. 
1197

Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-37 
 
1198 
Since 172.16.2.128 has all the 0s in the host portion, it is a subnetwork 
1199 
address. The first usage host address of this subnetwork would be 
1200 
172.16.2.129 (10101100.00010000.00000010.10000001). The last host 
1201 
address of this subnetwork would be 172.16.2.191 
1202 
(10101100.00010000.00000010.10111111). However, this address will be 
1203 
used as broadcast address. Therefore, the last usable host address would be 
1204 
172.16.2.190 (10101100.00010000.00000010.10111110). Therefore, the 
1205 
host range of 172.16.2.128 network is 172.16.2.129 - 172.16.2.190.

Summary 
1215 
This section summarizes the key points you learned in this lesson. 
1216 
 
1217 
I 
Subnetting allows a network administrator to get around the limitations of 
1218 
IPv4 by dividing a single network address into many subnets visible only 
1219 
within that single network. 
1220 
I 
Subnets are concealed from outside networks by using masks referred to as 
1221 
subnet masks. 
1222 
I 
Internetworking functions of the network layer include network addressing 
1223 
and best-path selection for data traffic. 
1224 
I 
To provide extra flexibility for the network administrator, networks—
1225 
particularly large ones—are often divided into smaller networks called 
1226 
subnetworks or subnets.

Steps  
  
Step 1 
The router de-encapsulates and examines the frame to 
determine what type of network layer data is being carried. The 
network layer data is sent to the appropriate network layer 
process, and the frame (data link layer) header/trailer is 
discarded. 
Step 2 
The network layer process examines the network layer header to 
determine the destination network and then references the 
routing table that associates networks to outgoing interfaces. 
Step 3 
The packet is again encapsulated in the data link layer frame for 
the selected interface and sent on. 
 
1262 
Figure 3: How a Router Works http://currdev.cisco.com/ccnab/mdmedia.html#md6 
1263 
 
1264 
 
1265 
A router has two key functions: 
1266 
 
1267 
I 
First, it must maintain its routing tables and make sure other routers know 
1268 
of changes in the network. It does this by using a routing protocol to 
1269 
communicate network information from its routing table with other routers. 
1270 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-41 
I 
Second, when packets arrive to an interface, the router must use the routing 
1271 
table to determine where to send the packet. It switches them to the 
1272 
appropriate interface, adds the necessary framing for the particular 
1273 
interface, and then actually sends the packet. In some cases, a router will 
1274 
apply quality of service (QoS) and security functions. 
1275 
 
1276 
How a Router Works 
1277 
A router is a network layer device that uses one or more routing metrics to 
1278 
determine the optimal path along which network traffic should be forwarded. 
1279 
Routers tie together, or interconnect, network segments or entire networks. They 
1280 
pass data packets between networks based on Layer 3 information. Routers make 
1281 
logical decisions regarding the best path for the delivery of data on an internetwork 
1282 
and then direct packets to the appropriate output port and segment. Routers take 
1283 
packets from LAN devices (for example, workstations) and, based on Layer 3 
1284 
information, forward them through the network (see Figure [1]).   
1285 
 
1286 
Encapsulation 
1287 
The de-encapsulation and encapsulation process described in Figure [2] occurs each 
1288 
time the packet transfers thru a router. At the router connected to the network 
1289 
containing the destination host, the packet is encapsulated in the destination LAN 
1290 
data-link frame type for delivery to the protocol stack on the destination host.  
1291 
 
1292 
Figure [3] shows the processes of how a router works.

1315 
 
1316 
 
1317 
Routing is often contrasted with Layer 2 switching, which might seem to 
1318 
accomplish precisely the same thing to the casual observer. The primary difference 
1319 
between the two is that switching occurs at Layer 2 (the data link layer) of the OSI 
1320 
reference model, whereas routing occurs at Layer 3 (the network layer). This 
1321 
distinction provides routing and switching with different information to use in the 
1322 
process of moving information from source to destination, so that the two functions 
1323 
accomplish their tasks in different ways. The relationship between switching and 
1324 
routing parallels that of switching and the telephone. When a telephone call is made 
1325 
to another local number (with the same area code), a local switch handles the call.  
1326 
 
1327 
However, the local switch cannot keep track of all the telephone numbers in the 
1328 
United States—only its own local numbers. When the switch receives a request for 
1329 
a call outside of its area (signified by a ‘1’ being received as the first digit), it 
1330 
switches the call to a higher-level switch that recognizes area codes. The higher-
1331 
level switch is aware of area codes, and then switches the call so that it eventually 
1332 
gets to the local switch for the area code dialed (‘212’ in Figure [1]). 
1333 
 
1334 
The router performs a function similar to that of the higher-level switch in the 
1335 
telephone network (see Figure [2]). The Layer 2 switch cannot recognize the Layer 
1336 
3 IP address, only local MAC addresses. When a host has a packet for non-local IP 
1337 
address, it sends the packet to it’s default gateway (the router) it does this by using 
1338 
the MAC address of the router, hence the switch send the frame to the router.  
1339 
 
1340 
A Layer 2 switch interconnects segments belonging to same logical network or 
1341 
subnetwork.  If Host x needs to send a packet to another host on a different network 
1342 
or subnetwork, Host x will send the packet to the router which is also connected to 
1343 
the switch. The switch forwards the frame to the router based the router’s MAC 
1344 
address. The router will examine the Layer 3 destination address of the packet to 
1345 
make the forwarding decision. Host x knows the router’s IP address because Host x 
1346 
IP configuration will include the IP address of the default-gateway. The default-
1347 
gateway is the router that is on the same network or subnetwork as Host x.  
1348 
 
1349 
Much like the way a Layer 2 switch keeps a table of known MAC addresses, the 
1350 
router keeps a table of IP addresses known as the routing table. When a message is 
1351 
received in a router, the router looks up the address in its routing table and passes 
1352 
the message on to the next hop router to that network. The message eventually gets 
1353 
to the destination router which has an interface attached to the destination network.   
1354

1355 
Layer 2 switched networks do not block broadcasts and, as a result, they can be 
1356 
swamped by broadcast storms. Routers, on the other hand, block broadcasts so that 
1357 
a broadcast affects only a segment of the network. 
1358 
 
1359 
A broadcast domain consists of all the devices, which are connected to a 
1360 
LAN, that receive framed data broadcast by a machine to all other machines on the 
1361 
LAN (see Figure [3]). Even though the LAN switch reduces the size of collision 
1362 
domains, all hosts connected to the switch are still in the same broadcast domain. 
1363 
Therefore, a broadcast from one node will still be seen by all other nodes connected 
1364 
through the LAN switch. Broadcast domains are typically bounded by routers 
1365 
because routers do not forward broadcast frames.  
1366 
 
1367 
When a PC starts up, it may use DHCP to request an IP address and subnet mask to 
1368 
use from a DHCP server. Since the PC is not configured with the IP address of the 
1369 
DHCP server, the PC sends the DHCP request using the broadcast address 
1370 
(255.255.255.255). Routers will by default block the broadcast (keeping the 
1371 
broadcast to within the local network or subnetwork) but switch will flood the 
1372 
broadcast to all ports except the incoming port. 
1373 
 
1374 
Routers provider higher security and bandwidth control than Layer 2 switches 
1375 
because they are able to block broadcasts. Since Layer 2 switches does not block 
1376 
broadcast (where a data packet is sent to all nodes on a network). Broadcasts can 
1377 
consume a great deal of bandwidth. Routers are able to block broadcasts, so they 
1378 
provide security and assist in bandwidth control. Figure [4] shows a comparison of 
1379 
routers and Layer 2 switches.

6.3.3 Routed vs. Routing 
1390 
Figure 3: What is a Routing Protocol?  
1391 
 
1392 
 
1393 
Protocols that provide support for the network layer are called routed or routable 
1394 
protocols. 
1395 
 
1396 
A routed protocol:  
1397 
 
1398 
I 
Includes any network protocol suite that provides enough information in its 
1399 
network layer address to allow a packet to direct user traffic  
1400 
I 
Defines the format and use of the fields within a packet; packets generally 
1401 
are conveyed from end system to end system 
1402 
 
1403 
The Internet Protocol (IP) and Novell's IPX are examples of routed protocols. Other 
1404 
examples include DECnet, AppleTalk, Novell NetWare, Banyan VINES, and Xerox 
1405 
Network Systems (XNS). 
1406 
 
1407 
Routers use routing protocols to exchange routing tables and share routing 
1408 
information. In other words, routing protocols determine how routed protocols are 
1409 
routed. 
1410 
 
1411 
A routing protocol:  
1412 
 
1413 
I 
Supports a routed protocol by providing mechanisms for sharing routing 
1414 
information  
1415 
I 
Allows the routers to communicate with other routers to update and 
1416 
maintain the routing tables  
1417 
Examples of routing protocols that supports the IP routed protocol include the 
1418 
Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), 
1419 
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Enhanced 
1420 
IGRP (EIGRP). 
1421 
 
1422 
An example of a routing protocol that support other routed protocols such as Novell 
1423 
Netware is Novell RIP and Novell NLSP.

Using the Postal system as an example, you can think of the routing protocol as the 
1426 
postal system used between the post offices to determine how to best route your 
1427 
mail via the postal system. The routed protocol then defines the format of the 
1428 
address on the envelope and the format of the content inside the envelope. Like, 
1429 
each letter should have a date, some content, and signature at the bottom.  
1430 
Practice 
1431 
1. Which best describes a routed protocol? 
1432 
 
1433 
A. Provides enough information to allow a packet to be forwarded from 
1434 
host to host ** 
1435 
B. Provides information necessary to pass data packets up to the next 
1436 
highest network layer

1445 
Routers use routing tables and network addresses to transmit data through the 
1446 
network. Routing involves two basic activities: 
1447 
 
1448 
I 
Determining optimal routing paths 
1449 
I 
Transporting information groups (typically called packets) through an 
1450 
internetwork 
1451 
During path determination, routers evaluate the available paths to a destination and 
1452 
establish the preferred handling of a packet: 
1453 
 
1454 
I 
Routing services use internetwork topology information have not defined 
1455 
metric yet when evaluating network paths. This information can be 
1456 
configured onto each router by the network administrator statically or it can 
1457 
be learned dynamically by the routers using a routing protocol.  
1458 
I 
After the router determines which path to use, it can proceed with switching 
1459 
the packet by taking the packet it accepted on one interface and forwarding 
1460 
it to another interface or port that reflects the best path to the packet 
1461 
destination.

6.3.5 Routing Tables 
1477 
Figure 1: Routing Tables  
1478 
 
1479 
 
1480 
To aid in the process of path determination, routing protocols initialize and maintain 
1481 
routing tables, which contain route information. Route information varies, 
1482 
depending on the routing protocol used. Routing protocols fill routing tables with a 
1483 
variety of information. 
1484 
 
1485 
Figure [1] shows how routers keep tables of information to aid in the traffic 
1486 
management and path determination. 
1487 
 
1488 
Routing-Table Information 
1489 
Routers keep track of important information in their routing tables like:  
1490 
 
1491 
I 
Destination/next-hop associations: These associations tell a router that a 
1492 
particular destination is either directly connected to the router or it can be 
1493 
reached via another router called the “next hop” router on the way to the 
1494 
final destination. When a router receives an incoming packet, it checks the 
1495 
destination address and attempts to associate this address with either a 
1496 
directly connected interface or to the next hop router. 
1497 
I 
Routing Metric: Different routing protocols use different routing metric. 
1498 
Routing metric is used to determining the desirability of the route. For 
1499 
example, the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) routing protocol uses hop 
1500 
count as its routing metric. A hop represent an intermediate router a packet 
1501 
must goes through before reaching the destination. Therefore, a route 
1502 
having a lower total hop count will be more desirable than another route 
1503 
with a higher total hop count, because the lower hop count route has to go 
1504 
through less intermediate routers. 
1505 
Routing Update Messages 
1506 
Routers communicate with one another and maintain their routing tables through the 
1507 
transmission of routing update messages. Routing update messages are exchanged 
1508 
between routers. Depending on the particular routing protocol, routing update 
1509 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-49 
messages can be sent periodically or only when there is a change in the network 
1510 
topology. Some of the information contains in the routing update messages include, 
1511 
the destination networks that the router can reach along with the routing metric to 
1512 
reach each destination. By analyzing the routing updates from the neighboring 
1513 
routers, a router can build and maintain it’s routing table.

Figure 2: Routing Metrics 
1539 
 
1540 
 
1541 
Routing protocols often have one or more of the following design goals (see Figure 
1542 
[1]): 
1543 
 
1544 
I 
Optimization: Optimization describes the capability of the routing 
1545 
protocol/algorithm to select the best route, depending on metrics and metric 
1546 
weightings used in the calculation. For example, one algorithm may use hop 
1547 
count and delays for its metric, but may weight delay more heavily in the 
1548 
calculation. 
1549 
I 
Simplicity and low overhead: Ideally efficient routing algorithm 
1550 
functionality is achieved if it has minimum CPU and memory overhead on 
1551 
the routers. This is important so that the network can scale to large 
1552 
proportions, like the Internet.   
1553 
I 
Robustness and stability: A routing algorithm should perform correctly in 
1554 
the face of unusual or unforeseen circumstances, such as hardware failures, 
1555 
high load conditions, and implementations errors.  
1556 
I 
Rapid convergence: Convergence is the process of agreement, by all 
1557 
routers, on optimal routes. When a network event causes changes in router 
1558 
availability, recalculations are needed to reestablish network connectivities. 
1559 
Routing algorithms that converge slowly can cause routing loops or network 
1560 
outages. 
1561 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 6: IP Addressing and Routing 6-51 
I 
Flexibility: A routing algorithm should quickly and accurately adapt to a 
1562 
variety of network circumstances. Changes of consequence include router 
1563 
availability, changes in network bandwidth, queue size, and network delay. 
1564 
 
1565 
Metrics 
1566 
When a routing algorithm updates a routing table, its primary objective is to 
1567 
determine the best information to include in the table. Routing algorithms have used 
1568 
many different metrics to determine the best route. Each routing algorithm interprets 
1569 
what is best in its own way. The algorithm generates a number, called the metric 
1570 
value, for each path through the network. Sophisticated routing algorithms can base 
1571 
route selection on multiple metrics, combining them in a single (hybrid) metric. 
1572 
Typically, the smaller the metric number is, the better the path (see Figure [2]). 
1573 
 
1574 
You can calculate metrics based on a single characteristic of a path; you can 
1575 
calculate more complex metrics by combining several characteristics. The metrics 
1576 
that are most commonly used by routers are as follows: 
1577 
 
1578 
I 
Bandwidth—The data capacity of a link. (Normally, a 10-Mbps Ethernet 
1579 
link is preferable to a 64-kbps leased line.) 
1580 
I 
Delay—The length of time required to move a packet along each link from 
1581 
source to destination. Delay depends on the bandwidth of intermediate 
1582 
links, port queues at each router, network congestion, and physical distance. 
1583 
I 
Load—The amount of activity on a network resource such as a router or a 
1584 
link. 
1585 
I 
Reliability—Usually a reference to the error rate of each network link. 
1586 
I 
Hop count—The number of routers that a packet must travel through before 
1587 
reaching its destination. 
1588 
I 
Ticks—The delay on a data link using IBM PC clock ticks (approximately 
1589 
55 milliseconds or 1/18 second).  
1590 
I 
Cost—An arbitrary value, usually based on bandwidth, monetary expense, 
1591 
or other measurement, that is assigned by a network administrator. 
1592 
Practice

Summary 
1600 
This section summarizes the key points you learned in this lesson. 
1601 
 
1602 
I 
Routers operate at the network layer. They also operate at Layers 1 and 2 of 
1603 
the OSI model. Initially, the router receives a Layer 2 frame with a Layer 3 
1604 
packet encapsulated within it. The router must strip off the Layer 2 frame to 
1605 
examine the Layer 3 packet. When the router is ready to transmit the packet, 
1606 
the router then must reencapsulate the Layer 3 packet in a Layer 2 frame 
1607 
(For example, encapsulate IP packets into Layer 2 Frame Relay frames or 
1608 
Layer 2 Ethernet frames). 
1609 
I 
Routed protocols define the format and use of the fields within a packet. 
1610 
Packets generally are conveyed from end system to end system. 
1611 
I 
Switching occurs at Layer 2 of the OSI reference model; whereas routing 
1612 
occurs at Layer 3. 
1613 
I 
Routing protocols are used between routers to determine paths and maintain 
1614 
routing tables. Routed protocols are used to direct user traffic. 
1615 
I 
Routing involves two basic activities: determining the best routing paths 
1616 
and transporting packets through and internetwork.

1656 
Figure 1: Autonomous Systems: Interior or Exterior Routing Protocols 
1657 
 
1658 
 
1659 
An autonomous system is a network or set of networks that are under the 
1660 
administrative control of a single entity, such as the cisco.com domain. An 
1661 
autonomous system consists of routers, run by one or more operators that present a 
1662 
consistent view of routing to the external world. The Network Information Center 
1663 
(NIC) assigns a unique autonomous system to enterprises. This autonomous system 
1664 
is a 16-bit number. A routing protocol such as Cisco's IGRP requires that you 
1665 
specify this unique, assigned autonomous system number in your configuration.  
1666 
 
1667 
Routers use routing protocols to exchange routing information. In other words, 
1668 
routing protocols determine how routed protocols are routed. Two types of routing 
1669 
protocols are the Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) and the Exterior Gateway 
1670 
Protocols (EGPs).

1710 
Routing protocols fall into three classes: distance vector, link state, and hybrid. 
1711 
  
1712 
Distance-Vector Protocols 
1713 
The distance-vector routing approach determines the direction (vector) and distance 
1714 
(hop count) to any link in the internetwork. Distance-vector algorithms periodically 
1715 
(such as every 30 seconds) send all or some portion of their routing table only to its 
1716 
adjacent neighbors. Routers running distance vector routing protocol sends periodic 
1717 
updates even if there are no changes in the network. By receiving a neighbor’s 
1718 
routing table, a router can verify all of the known routes and make changes to the 
1719 
local routing table based upon updated information received from the neighboring 
1720 
router. This process is also known as “routing by rumor” because a router’s 
1721 
understanding of the network is based upon the neighbor’s perspective of the 
1722 
network topology (see Figure [1]).   
1723 
 
1724 
Examples of distance-vector protocols include (see Figure [2]):

I 
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP): This IGP was developed by 
1729 
Cisco to address the issues associated with routing in large, heterogeneous 
1730 
networks. 
1731 
Link-State Protocols  
1732 
Link-State routing protocols were designed to overcome the limitations of distance 
1733 
vector routing protocols. Link-state routing protocols respond quickly to network 
1734 
changes, send trigger updates only when a network change has occurred and send 
1735 
periodic update (know as link-state refresh), at long time interval, such as every 30 
1736 
minutes. 
1737 
 
1738 
When a link changes state, the device that detected the change creates a link-state 
1739 
advertisement (LSA) concerning that link (route) and that LSA is propagated to all 
1740 
neighboring devices. Each routing device takes a copy of the LSA, updates its link-
1741 
state (topological) database, and forwards the LSA to all neighboring devices. This 
1742 
flooding of the LSA is required to ensure that all routing devices update their 
1743 
databases before creating an updated routing table that reflects the new topology 
1744 
(see Figure [3]).  
1745 
 
1746 
The link-state database is used to calculate the best paths through the network. Link-
1747 
state routers find the best paths to destination by applying the Dijkstra (SPF – 
1748 
Shortest Path First) algorithm against the link-state database to build the shortest 
1749 
path first tree. The best (shortest) paths are then selected from the shortest path first 
1750 
tree and placed in the routing table. 
1751 
 
1752 
Examples of link-state protocol are Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and 
1753 
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) (see Figure [4]). 
1754 
 
1755 
Hybrid Protocols 
1756 
A third classification, called hybrid, combines aspects of distance-vector and link 
1757 
state algorithms (see Figure [5]). 
1758 
 
1759 
An example of a hybrid algorithm is Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
1760 
(EIGRP). This protocol is an advanced version of IGRP developed by Cisco. It 
1761 
provides superior convergence properties and operating efficiency, and combines 
1762 
the advantages of link-state protocols with those of distance-vector protocols. 
1763 
 
1764 
There is no single best routing algorithm for all internetworks. Network 
1765 
administrators must weigh technical and non-technical aspects of their network to 
1766 
determine what is best.  
1767

6.4.3 RIPv1 and RIPv2 
1784 
Figure 2: Hop Count (Flash animation) 
1785 
 
1786 
 
1787 
RIP uses distance-vector algorithms to determine the direction and distance to any 
1788 
link in the internetwork. 
1789 
 
1790 
If there are multiple paths to a destination, RIP selects the path with the least 
1791 
number of hops. However, because hop count is the only routing metric used by 
1792 
RIP. It does not necessarily select the fastest path to a destination. It counts only 
1793 
hops. 
1794 
 
1795 
RIP allows routers to update their routing tables at programmable intervals, the 
1796 
default interval is every 30 seconds. Because RIP is constantly sending routing 
1797 
updates to its neighboring routers, this process can cause network traffic to build. 
1798 
To avoid a packet to loop infinity, RIP has a hop count limitation of 15 hops. If the 
1799 
destination network is more than 15 routers away, it is considered unreachable and 
1800 
the packet will be dropped. This limitation creates a scalability issue when routing 
1801 
in large, heterogeneous networks (see Figure [1]).  
1802 
 
1803 
Despite these limitations, RIP, one of the earliest routing protocols to be developed, 
1804 
remains very popular and is still widely implemented because it is easy to configure. 
1805 
Many host (like Unix Host) can also run RIP.  
1806 
 
1807 
RIP version 1 (RIPv1) uses only classful routing. This means that all devices in the 
1808 
network must use the same subnet mask because RIPv1 does not include the subnet 
1809 
information with the routing update.  
1810 
 
1811 
RIP version 2 (RIPv2) provides what is called prefix routing and does send subnet 
1812 
mask information with the route updates. This supports the use of classless routing. 
1813 
With classless routing protocols, different subnets within the same network can 
1814 
have different subnet masks. The use of different subnet masks within the same 
1815 
network is referred to as variable-length subnet masking (VLSM).

6.4.4 IGRP 
1824 
Figure 1: IGRP vs. RIP 
1825 
 
1826 
 
1827 
IGRP is a distance-vector routing protocol developed by Cisco. It was developed 
1828 
specifically to address problems associated with routing in large networks that were 
1829 
beyond the scope of protocols such as RIP.  
1830 
 
1831 
Whereas RIP selects the path with the fewest hops, IGRP can select the fastest path, 
1832 
base on the delay, bandwidth, load and reliability. Network administrators can 
1833 
determine the importance given to any one of these metrics, or allow IGRP to 
1834 
automatically calculate the optimal path. By default IGRP uses bandwidth and delay 
1835 
metrics only. IGRP also has a much higher maximum hop count limit than RIP to 
1836 
allow the network to scale. 
1837 
 
1838 
IGRP sends routing updates at 90-second intervals, advertising network for a 
1839 
particular autonomous system. Some of the IGRP key design characteristics 
1840 
emphasize the following: 
1841 
 
1842 
I 
Versatility that enables it to automatically handle indefinite, complex 
1843 
topologies 
1844 
I 
Flexibility for segments that have different bandwidth and delay 
1845 
characteristics 
1846 
I 
Scalability for functioning in very large networks

6.4.5 EIGRP 
1858 
Figure 1: EIGRP 
1859 
 
1860 
 
1861 
Like IGRP, EIGRP is a proprietary Cisco protocol. EIGRP is an advanced version 
1862 
of IGRP. Specifically, EIGRP provides superior operating efficiency such as faster 
1863 
convergence and lower overhead bandwidth. It combines the advantages of link-
1864 
state protocols with those of distance-vector protocols.  
1865 
 
1866 
EIGRP uses four basic components that enhance its ability to route data beyond 
1867 
IGRP: 
1868 
 
1869 
I 
Neighbor discovery/recovery—This feature allows routers to learn about 
1870 
neighboring routers dynamically. 
1871 
I 
Reliable Transport Protocol—This technology guarantees the ordered 
1872 
delivery of EIGRP packets to all neighbors. 
1873 
I 
DUAL finite-state machine—Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) tracks 
1874 
all routes advertised by all neighbors so that it can select a loop-free path. 
1875 
I 
Protocol-dependent modules—These modules are responsible for network 
1876 
layer, protocol-specific requirements needed to make routing decisions. 
1877 
EIGRP supports multiple routed protocols like IP, IPX and Appletalk.

6.4.6 OSPF  
1887 
Figure 1: What is OSPF?  
1888 
 
1889 
OSPF is a link-state technology, as opposed to a distance vector technology such 
1890 
as the RIP. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed OSPF in 
1891 
1988. The most recent version, known as OSPF version 2, is described in RFC 
1892 
2328. OSPF is an IGP, which means that it distributes routing information 
1893 
between routers belonging to the same autonomous system. OSPF was written to 
1894 
address the needs of large, scalable internetworks that RIP could not. The issues 
1895 
it addresses are as follows: 
1896 
I 
Speed of convergence—In large networks, RIP convergence can take 
1897 
several minutes as the routing algorithm goes through a hold-down and 
1898 
route-aging period. With OSPF, convergence is faster than with RIP 
1899 
because routing changes are flooded immediately and computed in parallel. 
1900 
I 
Support for variable-length subnet masks (VLSMs)—RIPv1 does not 
1901 
support VLSMs. OSPF supports subnet masking and VLSMs. (Note that 
1902 
RIPv2 supports VLSMs.) 
1903 
I 
Network reachability—A RIP network that spans more than 15 hops 
1904 
(15 routers) is considered unreachable. OSPF has virtually no reachability 
1905 
limitations. 
1906 
I 
Use of bandwidth—RIP broadcasts full routing tables to all neighbors 
1907 
every 30 seconds, which is especially problematic over slow WAN links. 
1908 
OSPF multicasts link-state updates and only sends the updates when there is 
1909 
a change in the network. (Note that OSPF does send updates every 30 
1910 
minutes to ensure that all routers are synchronized.) 
1911 
I 
Method for path selection—RIP has no concept of network delays and 
1912 
link costs. Routing decisions are based purely on hop count, which could 
1913 
lead to suboptimal path selection in cases where a longer path (in terms of 
1914 
hop count) has a higher aggregate link bandwidth and shorter delays. OSPF 
1915 
uses a cost value, which for Cisco routers is based on the speed of the 
1916 
connection.   
1917 
Practice 
1918 
1. Which of the following is not a feature of OSPF? 
1919 
 
1920 
A. Has fast convergence 
1921 
B. Processes updates efficiently 
1922 
C. Selects paths based on hop count ** 
1923 
D. Support VLSM

1928 
The OSI protocol suite supports numerous standard protocols at each of the seven 
1929 
OSI layers. Figure [1] illustrates the entire OSI protocol suite and its relation to the 
1930 
layers of the OSI reference model. Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-
1931 
IS) is the dynamic link-state routing protocol for the OSI protocol stack. As such it 
1932 
distributes routing information for routing Connectionless Network Protocol 
1933 
(CLNP) data for the ISO Connectionless Network Service (CLNS) environment. 
1934 
 
1935 
Note: CLNP refers to the OSI network layer protocol that does not require a circuit 
1936 
to be established before data is transmitted. CLNS refers to the OSI network layer 
1937 
service that does not require a circuit to be established before data is transmitted. 
1938 
 
1939 
Integrated IS-IS is an implementation of the IS-IS protocol for routing multiple 
1940 
network protocols. Integrated IS-IS tags CLNP routes with information regarding IP 
1941 
networks and subnets. It provides an alternative to OSPF in the IP world, mixing 
1942 
ISO CLNS and IP routing in one protocol. It can be used purely for IP routing, 
1943 
purely for ISO routing, or for a combination of the two.  
1944 
 
1945 
OSPF on the other hand, only supports IP. 
1946 
Practice 
1947 
1. Which of the following is true of IS-IS? 
1948 
 
1949 
A. IS-IS is a dynamic link-state routing protocol. 
1950 
B. Integrated IS-IS is an implementation of the IS-IS protocol for routing 
1951 
multiple network protocols. 
1952 
C. IS-IS can be used for both IP routing and ISO routing.

6.4.8 BGP 
1956 
Figure 1: BGP Prevents Routing Loop 
1957 
http://currdev.cisco.com/ccnab/mdmedia.html#md6 
1958 
 
1959 
 
1960 
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an example of an External Gateway Protocol 
1961 
(EGP) and has been most recently defined in RFC 1772.BGP exchanges routing 
1962 
information between autonomous systems while guaranteeing loop-free path 
1963 
selection. It is the principle route advertising protocol used by major companies and 
1964 
ISP’s on the Internet. BGP4 is the first version of BGP that supports CIDR and 
1965 
route aggregation. Unlike common Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) (such as RIP, 
1966 
OSPF, and EIGRP), BGP does not use technical metrics. Instead, BGP makes 
1967 
routing decisions based on network policies, or rules.  
1968 
 
1969 
BGP updates are carried using TCP on port 179. In contrast, RIP updates use User 
1970 
Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 520, whereas OSPF does not use either TCP or 
1971 
UDP.  Because BGP requires TCP, IP connectivity must exist between BGP peers, 
1972 
and TCP connections must be negotiated between them before updates can be 
1973 
exchanged. Thus, BGP inherits the reliable, connection-oriented properties of TCP. 
1974 
To guarantee loop-free path selection, BGP constructs a graph of autonomous 
1975 
systems based on the information exchanged between BGP neighbors. As far as 
1976 
BGP is concerned, the whole internetwork is a graph, or tree, of autonomous 
1977 
systems. The connection between any two systems forms a path, and the collection 
1978 
of path information is expressed as a sequence of autonomous-system numbers 
1979 
(called the autonomous-system path). This sequence forms a route to reach a 
1980 
specific destination, as shown in Figure [1].  
1981 
 
1982 
BGP4 is used extensively in the Internet today to connect Internet service providers 
1983 
(ISPs), and to connect enterprises to ISPs.

6.4.9 MPLS 
1992 
Figure 1: MPLS 
1993 
 
1994 
 
1995 
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the intelligence of routing with 
1996 
the performance of switching. It also provides significant benefits to networks with 
1997 
a pure IP architecture, as well as those with IP and ATM, or a mix of other Layer 2 
1998 
technologies. MPLS technology is key to scalable virtual private networks (VPNs), 
1999 
end-to-end QoS. This enables efficient utilization of existing networks to meet 
2000 
future growth and rapid fault correction of link and node failure. The technology 
2001 
also helps deliver highly scalable, differentiated end-to-end IP services with simpler 
2002 
configuration, management, and provisioning for both Internet providers and 
2003 
subscribers.  
2004 
 
2005 
Based on label swapping, a single forwarding mechanism provides opportunities for 
2006 
new control paradigms and applications. MPLS Label Forwarding is performed with 
2007 
a label lookup for an incoming label, which is then swapped with the outgoing label 
2008 
and finally sent to the next hop. 
2009 
 
2010 
Labels are imposed on the packets only once at the edge of the MPLS network and 
2011 
removed at the other end. These labels are assigned to packets based on groupings 
2012 
or forwarding equivalence classes (FECs). Packets belonging to the same FEC get 
2013 
similar treatment. The label is added between the Layer 2 and the Layer 3 header (in 
2014 
a packet environment) or in the virtual path identifier/virtual channel identifier 
2015 
(VPI/VCI) field (in ATM networks). The core network merely reads labels, applies 
2016 
appropriate services, and forwards packets based on the labels. This MPLS lookup 
2017 
and forwarding scheme offers the ability to explicitly control routing based on 
2018 
destination and source addresses, allowing easier introduction of new IP services. 
2019 
Practice

1. Which of the following does not describe MPLS? 
2021 
 
2022 
A. MPLS technology helps deliver highly scalable, differentiated end-to-
2023

2024

IP addresses are based on the Internet Protocol (IP). IPv4 addresses are 
2073 
unique 32-bit logical addresses that exist at Layer 3, the network layer of 
2074 
the OSI reference model. IP addresses are used to logically identify devices 
2075 
on an IP network. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.

There are three classes of IP addresses that an organization can use, Classes 
2077 
A, B, and C.

To create subnets, the maximum number of bits that can be borrowed can be 
2079 
any number that leaves at least 2 bits remaining, for the host number.
